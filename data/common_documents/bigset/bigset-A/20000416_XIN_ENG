<HEADLINE> hke041527--Roundup: Reform Dominates Bangladesh Development Forum By Chen Jian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The two-day Bangladesh Development
Forum ended Friday in Paris, with the government of Bangladesh and
its development partners agreeing that the country's key challenge
was to eradicate poverty substantially within one generation.
</P>
<P>
At the forum, which was attended by delegations from 27
countries and international organizations, the development
partners reaffirmed their resolve to assist the people of
Bangladesh in addressing the challenge of poverty reduction and
economic growth based on accelerated policy and institutional
reforms.
</P>
<P>
The level of assistance for the 2000-2001 fiscal year could
range between 1.8 billion and 2.2 billion U.S. dollars. The
development partners emphasized that the actual level of
assistance will depend on progress in policy and institutional
reforms, and faster utilization of the existing aid pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Aid levels could be higher if the pace of reforms accelerated,
they noted.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that poverty is still pervasive in the country,
participants urged the Bangladeshi government to implement
critical policy and institutional reforms with decisiveness and
urgency.
</P>
<P>
They stressed the fundamental importance of improving
governance, especially transparency and accountability, and
reducing corruption, noting that these were directly linked to
increased growth and poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
The development partners appreciated Dhaka's willingness to
discuss governance issues at the Paris meeting and its
presentation of its initiatives to strengthen institutions,
improve governance and reduce corruption.
</P>
<P>
These initiatives include democratization of local governments,
measures to improve law and order, reforms in banking and loan
recovery, customs and tax administration and public administration,
and measures to curb corruption.
</P>
<P>
The participants also stressed the importance of reforms in the
police force and in election financing, and urged faster
implementation of public administration reforms, the strengthening
of audit institutions, and increasing transparency in procurement.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government emphasized the centrality of poverty
alleviation in its development strategy during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Finance Minister Shah Kibria told a press
conference Friday that since poverty in Bangladesh is a multi-
dimensional problem and the poor are heterogeneous, strategy for
poverty reduction needed to be flexible, and a multi-pronged
approach needed to be taken to tackle the problem more
aggressively.
</P>
<P>
While recognizing the need for administrative reforms, he said
the timing of the reforms would have to be determined in the light
of socio-political reality.
</P>
<P>
He urged the development partners to continue to help expedite
the pace of development and poverty reduction in Bangladesh,
emphasizing the need for human resources development and speedy
economic growth as they are intrinsically related to the
challenges of poverty reduction.

<HEADLINE> Two Bangladeshis Killed by Indian Border Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Two Bangladeshi citizens were
killed and 10 others injured when Indian Border Security Forces (
BSF) opened fire Saturday at village Baitta Nagar of Feni district,
some 150 kilometers southeast of Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
According a report of the official Bangladesh News Agency, two
of the injured were admitted to a Feni hospital, while the others
were released after receiving first aid in a local health complex.
</P>
<P>
Personnel of the Bangladesh Rifles rushed to the scene from
Feni and tension was prevailing in the area.
</P>
<P>
The report said an Indian citizen Wednesday accused some
Bangladeshis of stealing his cow and then a group of Indian
citizens with the support of the BSF entered the Bangladeshi
territory Friday and forcibly took away seven cows of Bangladeshi
villagers.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the area worsened Saturday when more than 100
Indian citizens with the support of the BSF entered the
Bangladeshi territory and attacked the Bangladeshi villagers,
which later resulted in a clash between them.
</P>
<P>
Then the BSF fired indiscriminately on the Bangladeshi
villagers, killing two Bangladeshis and injuring 10 others, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Govt Ratifies Economic Reform Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government ratified
on Saturday an economic reform package which will be presented at
the Nepal Development Forum meeting to be held on April 17-19 in
Paris, Finance Minister Mahesh Acharya told the press before
leaving for Paris.
</P>
<P>
The package, which contains restructuring of the country's
economic and fiscal sector, decentralization, improvement in civil
service and the effective use of foreign aid, is aimed at
effecting radical changes in the state machinery and the economic
policy in view of the widespread slackness in the socio-economic
sector of Nepal, said Acharya.
</P>
<P>
Acharya is heading a five-member delegation to Paris for the
three-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The reform package is to "convince donor countries that we need
assistance to mobilize our internal resources and to improve our
aid utilization mechanism, but not to bridge the gap between
savings and expenditure," said Acharya.
</P>
<P>
He said foreign aid had to be linked with development
strategies and priorities in order to help achieve development
goals.
</P>
<P>
"The present government is highly serious about intensifying
the development process through the judicious and skillful use of
foreign aid," he said.
</P>
<P>
As one of the poorest countries in the world, Nepal receives
about 60 percent of its development project funds from donor
countries.

<HEADLINE> Iranian City Councilor Arrested in Connection with Assassination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative judiciary on
Sunday announced that Tehran municipal council member Ahmad
Hakimipour had been arrested in connection with the abortive
assassination against a prominent reformist.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic revolutionary court in Tehran said in a statement
that Hakimipour had been arrested in Zanjan province, central Iran,
on the confessions of other people arrested on the same charge.
</P>
<P>
It said that Hakimipour, known as a reformist, was arrested
after he refused to appear in court to give explanations and was
transferred to Tehran for trial, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Local press said that Hakimipour was nabbed on Friday in his
father's house on charge of having a hand in the assassination
attempt against Saeed Hajjarian, deputy chairman of Tehran
municipal council and an advisor to Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, former deputy intelligence minister, was seriously
wounded in a shooting in front of the council hall in downtown
Tehran on February 12, and recovered his consciousness in recent
weeks following a long coma.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Hakimipour became a suspect in the
assassination because a letter handed over to Hajjarian, which
prepared the ground for the assassination attempt, was signed by
Hakimipour.
</P>
<P>
Iranian security force have arrested 10 suspects, including the
man who shot Hajjarian and the one who delivered the letter to
Hajjarian.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers closed to the powerful conservatives, who dominate
most of the country's sensitive organs, urged the authorities to
find the relations between Hakimipour and other suspects.
</P>
<P>
Widespread rumors here had claimed that the conservatives were
behind the assassination attempt because he played an important
role in the reformists' landslide victory in parliament elections
in February, a result which humiliated the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said that with Hakimipour's arrest, the already
hot factional struggle between the reformists and the conservatives
would reach a new peak.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Meet Jordanian King Abdullah, Egyptian President Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat will meet Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein here on Monday and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in
Cairo on Tuesday, said a PNA senior official here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The meetings will take place on the eve of Arafat's visit to
Washington that starts on April 20, according to Arafat's adviser
Nabil Abu-Rudeinah.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Arafat and King Abdullah will focus on the
latest developments of the Palestinian-Israeli peace process and
the ways of supporting the Palestinian stance in the peace talks
especially before the summit between Arafat and U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah's visit to Gaza is "highly important and falls
within the framework of continuous coordination and consultation
between Palestine and Jordan," Abu-Rudeinah said.
</P>
<P>
This is the second visit to Gaza by King Abdullah since he
assumed the throne in 1998. He last visited Gaza in 1999.
</P>
<P>
On his way to Washington, Arafat will stop over in Cairo on
Tuesday and consult with Mubarak, the PNA official added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abu-Rudeinah said Arafat will receive Omani Minister
of State for Foreign Affairs Yousef Bin Alawi Bin Abdullah who will
convey to him a message from Omani Sultan Qaboos Bin Said on the
Middle East and the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The PNA official underscored the importance of conducting an
Arab appraisal of the peace talks, pointing out that the Washington
talks between Israel and the Palestinians have failed so far to
make any headway.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined the importance of Arab-U.S. coordination and
consultation to push forward the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Emir, Lebanese President Discuss Boosting Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-
Ahmed Al-Sabah on Sunday met with visiting Lebanese President Emile
Lahoud on ways of boosting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The talks also touched upon a wide-range of important issues of
mutual concern, the Kuwait News Agency reported. But it didn't go
into further details about the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports by the agency said the Kuwaiti-Lebanese talks
should cover the latest developments in the Middle East peace
process, especially Israel's planned withdrawal from South Lebanon
by next July and its possible repercussion.
</P>
<P>
Before the bilateral talks, Lahoud received the Lebanese
community in his residence at Bayan Palace, Kuwait's state guest
house.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Lahoud told the Lebanese that his visit is to "
express gratitude to the state of Kuwait for its support to Lebanon
against the Israeli aggression. "
</P>
<P>
"We cannot forget the Kuwaiti Parliament's decision to back
Lebanon against the recent Israeli attacks," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Israel's possible withdrawal, Lahoud said "Israel tries to
claim that we are against the pullback. On the contrary, we are
with implementation of all international resolutions relevant to
the unconditional return of Lebanese and Arab rights."
</P>
<P>
"We cannot accept to safeguard the security of Israel and to
shoulder responsibility from the problem that resulted from the
displacement of thousands of Palestinians in South Lebanon," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud arrived here earlier Sunday for a two-day official visit.
He is now on a seven-nation tour, which is designed to rally
support to force Israel to halt constant attacks on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He has visited Saudi Arabia and will travel to the United Arab
Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Egypt and Iran.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian, Canadian PMs Meet on Peace, Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Rauf
Rawabdeh on Sunday met with his Canadian counterpart Jean Chretien
over bilateral ties and the Middle East affairs.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Rawabdeh expressed his satisfaction about the
close ties between the two countries, and commended Canada upon its
aid to Jordan's development projects, including water project
innovations and mining and vocational training, Jordan's official
news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
After briefing Chretien on Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein's
efforts to push the peace process forward, Rawabdeh said the two
countries also hold identical views on the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also praised Canada's role in chairing the
Middle East multilateral talks on the refugee issue, and reiterated
Jordan's persistent support for the Palestinians to regain their
land as well as their rights to return home or ask for
compensation.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the kingdom is hosting some 1.2 million or some 40
percent of the Palestinian refugees who fled their homelands during
successive Middle East wars after the creation of Israel in 1948.
</P>
<P>
The refugee issue entailed a heavy financial burden to meet
basic needs of the refugees, Rawabdeh noted.
</P>
<P>
On domestic issues, Rawabdeh briefed Chretien on Jordan's
economic reforms, including its privatization of non-profitable
public enterprises, the efforts to amend laws and legislation to
meet requirements of the WTO and to attract the much-needed foreign
investments.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Iraq, Rawabdeh said Jordan is concerned with
the situation of the Iraqi people and children as a result of the
crippling international sanctions imposed on Iraq after its troops
invaded Kuwait during the 1990 Gulf Crisis.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh also called for increasing the trade relations as part
the efforts to boost economic cooperation between Jordan and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Chretien praised Jordanian efforts in the field of
economic legislation reforms which were aimed at attracting foreign
investments.
</P>
<P>
He added that Canada will remain a strong supporter to Jordan in
all political and economic fields, expressing his country's
readiness to invest in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian premier arrived in Amman for a three-day visit on
the fifth leg of his tour to the region, which has taken him to
Israel, the Palestinian territories, Egypt and Lebanon and will
take him to Syria and Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Peres Urges Barak to Recognize Emerging Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli prime minister
Shimon Peres Sunday called upon incumbent Prime Minister Ehud Barak
to support the establishment of a Palestinian state more publicly.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by Israel's Army Radio, Peres, who currently holds a
regional cooperation portfolio in Barak's cabinet, said any just
solution of the Palestinian issues should include the creation of "
a democratic, demilitarized state."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that Barak should publicly endorse the idea, not
only suggesting doing so, or refraining from using the taboo word "
state". Peres was referring to Barak's favorite word "entity",
which he kept using regarding a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The problem of Palestinian independence has been a controversial
and sensitive topic since the peace process between Israel and the
Palestinians was launched.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres expressed his personal view bravely over the
issue.
</P>
<P>
"we said we don't want to rule over another people. If we don't
want to rule over another people, let the other people rule over
itself. It means a Palestinian state," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Thus, he urged Barak to announce his support immediately as
there is no point in waiting. He went further to warn that
equivocation in this problem will only deteriorate the security
situation in the region, making it another "Bosnia or Kosovo".
</P>
<P>
Peres was Israeli prime minister from 1984 to 1986 and succeeded
the assassinated Yitzhak Rabin as prime minister again in November
1995, only to lose the general election to Benjamin Netanyahu seven
months later.
</P>
<P>
Peres, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his peace efforts in the
Palestinian-Israeli peace track in cooperation with Rabin and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in 1994, usually adopts a more
dovish policy toward the Palestinians than Barak.
</P>
<P>
It appears that Barak recently also softened his stance on the
issue of Palestinian Statehood.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Channel One television station reported Friday that
Barak told U.S. President Bill Clinton during their summit last
Tuesday that he will recognize a demilitarized Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Such a "Palestinian entity", according to Barak, should be
established on the territories evacuated by Israel Defense Forces,
which will amount to 70 percent to 80 percent of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinian side has been insisting that according
to the Oslo accords, an independent Palestinian state should be
established on all of the West Bank with east Jerusalem as its
capital.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Palestinians have full or partial control of near 40
percent of the territories. Arafat reiterated several times lately
that an independent Palestinian state will be established no later
than September 13, 2000, the day set for the two sides to sign a
final accord for permanent status issues.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli and Palestinian negotiators Saturday just ended the
second round of their final-status negotiations at Bolling Air
Force Base near Washington. The negotiations are intended to
resolve the most thorny issues such as the status of Jerusalem,
border, security, water and the return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
They are scheduled to reach a framework agreement by mid-May and
a final deal in September. However, the negotiations are proceeding
only at a crawling pace.

ADDIS ABABA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee
of Red Cross (ICRC) announced here Sunday that it has airlifted
about 150 tons of relief food to drought-affected people in Gode,

people suffering from starvation, needs about 900,000 tons of
relief food to feed its drought-affected and internally displaced
people during this year.

<HEADLINE> S. African Major Labor Organization Ready for Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A South African major labor
organization announced on Sunday that it was ready for wage
negotiations which it said would be characterized by
deliberations around policy issues particularly labor,
remuneration and government's restructuring plans.
</P>
<P>
The National, Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union
(NEHAWU) spokesman Moloantoa Molaba said in a statement at the
end of a two-day meeting that the organization was ready to start
wage negotiations in all sectors in which it was active.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was aimed at consolidating demands and develop
strategy of the labor organization.
</P>
<P>
Molaba said that in future labor negotiations, to be centered
around policy issues, NEHAWU would strive to close the apartheid
wage gap.
</P>
<P>
Public service sector negotiations would largely revolve
around labor and remuneration policy, Molaba said.
</P>
<P>
In the process, NEHAWU would "reject any attempt to fragment
the public service ... and unilateral restructuring by
government," Molaba added.
</P>
<P>
In the private welfare sector, which NEHAWU claims pays
appallingly, the organization would demand the minimum wage be
lifted from 500 rand (about 76 U.S. dollars) to 1,500 rand (about
230 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"We shall also campaign for a ministerial determination for a
minimum wage in this sector," he said.
</P>
<P>
The tertiary education sector bargaining strategy would be
underpinned by the defence of existing jobs and the transformation
of higher education and pursuit of rationalization of
institutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The private health sector, in which NEHAWU claimed that union
bashing and huge job cuts were prevalent, would see the
organization campaign for an end to job cuts and raising of the
minimum wage to 1,500 rand.
</P>
<P>
"We shall also want to campaign and call on the government to
regulate the development of private health and its interface with
public health," he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Minister Faces Indictment on Sexual Harassment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Transportation Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai is facing indictment on three counts of sexual
assault and sexual harassment based on complaints filed by three
women, police spokeswoman announced Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The police investigation team for the case ended their probe
Sunday afternoon and turned the findings to the State Attorney's
Office, saying that they collected enough evidence to support their
recommendations to charge Mordechai with indecent sexual acts.
</P>
<P>
The first complaint against Mordechai, a former defense
minister, surfaced on March 7, when a 23-year-old ministry staff
worker in Mordechai's office sobbed out to police that the minister
had sexually assaulted her against her will in his Tel Aviv office
for several times.
</P>
<P>
After the police began to investigate the case, two other women
submitted their own complaints against Mordechai about sexually
harassment acts, which took place over an eight-year period.
</P>
<P>
One of them claimed that in November 1996, when Mordechai was
defense minister, he sexually advanced on her by inviting the
victim to his home to discuss a job application.
</P>
<P>
The other complained that Mordechai sexually harassed her in his
Netanya home in October 1992, when he was head of Israel's Northern
Command.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai reiterated on Sunday afternoon that he is entirely
innocent and he will fight with all his strength to prove his
innocence and clear his fame.
</P>
<P>
If Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein finally decides to indict
him, Mordechai said, he will request the Knesset (parliament) to
lift his parliamentary immunity, and resign from the cabinet in
order to ensure a swift and impartial trial.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman, who himself was recently half-
cleared by police from indictments on his financial irregularities,
said he deeply regrets the outcome of police probe and he hopes the
minister would be proven innocent.
</P>
<P>
But he emphasized that the law should be same for all,
regardless of their political positions.
</P>
<P>
Saliah Tarif, chairman of Knesset House Committee, said that if
the attorney general asked the Knesset to lift Mordechai's
immunity, he will convene the committee as soon as possible to
discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai had taken a leave from his cabinet post immediately
following the misconduct allegations and related police
investigation on March 7. Prime Minister Ehud Barak currently
assumed his responsibility for his ministry temporarily.
</P>
<P>
It is still unknown whether and when he would resign as head of
the six-seat Center Party in Barak's ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
It is also unclear who will take up his post in the security
cabinet, and whether the cabinet will undergo the first major
reshuffle since Barak took office last July.
</P>
<P>
A former major general of Israel Defense Forces, Mordechai
joined the Likud party in the 1996 general elections and became the
defense minister in former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
government from 1996 to 1999. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mordechai, widely considered a moderate in the right-
wing government, was at odds with Netanyahu over a number of
issues, especially the peace process with the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
In the May 1999 elections, Mordechai defected to the Center
Party and ran for premiership himself. He announced to quit the
race at the last minute, which helped Barak defeat Netanyahu in the
first round by a large margin. He and his Center Party later joined
Barak's ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Now, Mordechai became another senior figure in the political
circle, which is recently busy with a series of police
investigations, to face criminal indictment.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, Mordechai's political opponent, had been recommended
by police on March 28 to be indicted with charges such as bribery,
fraud and breach of public trust.
</P>
<P>
Two of Mordechai's confidants, his bureau chief Michal Kallah
and his driver Meir Ohayun, are also recommended by police to face
indictment on obstruction of justice because their role in the
case. Both of them reportedly had urged the recent "victim" of
Mordechai to drop the accusation.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Visits Kuwait to Rally Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile
Lahoud arrived here Sunday on the second leg of his seven-nation
tour, which is designed to garner political and economic support
for his tiny Middle East country.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, Lahoud will meet with Kuwaiti Emir
Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah on means of fostering bilateral
relations, according to the official Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also discuss a number of issues of mutual
interest and coordinate positions "towards the Israeli
intransigence concerning the Middle East peace process, especially
on the Lebanese-Israeli and Syrian-Israeli tracks," the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kuwaiti cabinet, in its weekly session Sunday,
welcomed Lahoud's visit and took it as a "chance to exchange views
on many issues of common concern, especially the latest Arab
development."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, which has made repeated calls for an Israeli withdrawal
from the occupied Arab lands and implementation of international
resolutions, is "keen on expressing solidarity and full support for
Lebanon" in its struggle to recover territory from the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a so-called security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks. Israeli cabinet in early March
approved to withdraw from south Lebanon by July, with or without an
agreement with Lebanon and its powerbroker Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese president arrived here from Saudi Arabia after
securing support from Riyadh during a two-day visit there. He will
also go to the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Egypt and
Iran.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congressman Arrives in Iraq for Landmark Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Congressman Tony Hall arrived
here Sunday evening, becoming the first U.S. lawmaker to visit Iraq
since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Hall, heading a three-member delegation, arrived here at 19:17
(1517 GMT) by land from Jordanian capital Amman, and stayed at the
five-star Mansour Hotel.
</P>
<P>
At the entrance of the Mansour Hotel, Hall made a brief
statement, saying that he came to Iraq because he has heard for a
long time about the humanitarian situation here, especially the
malnutrition among the Iraqi children and the increasing mortality
rate of the children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
He also said that his visit will mainly focus on the
humanitarian situation of Iraq, which has been under crippling U.N.
sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, the primacord of the
1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
"The visit is not a political visit, it is a visit of
humanitarian concerns," he added.
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of issues I want to take a look at, but the
issue of humanitarian concerns is number one," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Iraq, he will visit several places, including
hospitals and schools, in Baghdad and southern Iraq, where the U.S.
and Britain imposed a no-fly zone, with the claimed aim of
protecting Shi'ite Muslims from possible attacks by Iraqi
government.
</P>
<P>
Bombing targets in the no-fly zones in southern and northern
Iraq by U.S. and British warplanes have almost become a daily
occurrence, causing serious civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
When asked by Xinhua if there is any plan for him to meet Iraq
officials, he said "I have not been asked to meet any top Iraqi
officials. My concern is with the Red Cross, the (Iraqi) Red
Crescent, to see what they have to show me, to see with my own eyes
and make up my own mind."
</P>
<P>
However, it has been reported that Hall is expected to meet
Iraqi Health Minister Umid Medhat Mubarak and representatives of
all international aid organizations working in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has claimed that more than 1.5 million people, mostly
children and the elderly, have died of curable diseases due to the
decade-long U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has accused the U.S., which vehemently opposes the lifting
of the sanctions against Iraq, of using the sanctions as a tool to
contain the Iraqi regime headed by President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, some 70 U.S. congressmen sent a letter to U.
S. President Bill Clinton, calling for an end to the humanitarian
crisis in Iraq by having the sanctions lifted.

<HEADLINE> Economic Cooperation Core of Russia-Belarus Union: Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The solution of economic problems
should make up the core of the Russian-Belarussian Union, Russian
President-elect Vladimir Putin said in Belarussian capital of
Minsk on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Economics is a priority in implementing the Russia-Belarus
Union State Treaty, Putin told journalists Sunday at the end of an
enlarged Russian-Belarus talks.
</P>
<P>
No cooperation projects in the military or any other spheres
can be built "on the shaky foundation of the economy, which we
understand differently so far," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He urged the two states to adopt a single taxation, customs
service and tariff policy.
</P>
<P>
"The construction of a union state is a stupendous effort,
which should be carried out without fuss and with care and
consistency,"Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Selecting Belarus for his first international trip after being
elected Russia's head of state "shows Russia's readiness to
continue developing relations with Belarus along the course of
integration started by former Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
The subjects of his "face-to-face" meeting with Lukashenko were
the implementation of the Union State Treaty, bilateral relations,
political, economic and military cooperation, elections to the
Union parliament and other issues "of prime importance for Russia,
" Putin told reporters after his talks with Lukashenko behind
closed doors at the latter's Zaslavl-2 residence.
</P>
<P>
Putin, accompanied by Russian Fuel and Energy Minister and
Trade Minister, arrived in Minsk for a working visit Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Belarussian Prime Minister Vladimir Yermoshin and presidential
staff chief Mikhail Myasnikovich met Putin at the national Minsk-2
airport.
</P>
<P>
Following visit in Minsk, Putin will travel to the United
Kingdom and Ukraine.

<P>
Police estimated some 600 people were arrested for parading
without a permit, and similar charges, and led peacefully to
waiting buses.
</P>
<P>
With helicopters whirling overhead and police sirens blasting,
chanting demonstrators linked arms and blocked intersections near
the World Bank, a target of the protests.
</P>
<P>
Police fired tear gas to disperse a crowd of protesters who
were blocking intersections in their effort to disrupt the spring
meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF)
on Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
Washington Police Chief Charles Ramsey said at a press
conference the "use of tear gas is something we don't resort to
unless we absolutely have to."
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the gas was fired, some demonstrators threw
bottles at the police, while others remonstrated with them,
shouting "Non-violent protest."
</P>
<P>
Those who provide identification will be fined 50 U.S. dollars,
while those who don't will be fined 300 dollars, Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
Protesters complained that there was no warning before the
arrests began.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian President-elect Vladimir
Putin and his Belarus counterpart Alexander Lukashenko discussed
the Russia-Belarus Union Treaty's fulfillment and pressing issues
on strengthening bilateral cooperation Sunday in Minsk.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have narrowed their differences on a number of
important problems in their relations and may sign appropriate
bilateral accords soon, Putin told a joint news conference after
the tete-a-tete meeting with Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
The sides have agreed to do business in the military, technical,
and economic spheres, said Putin, cited by the Itar-Tass news
agency.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to expand cooperation in the military and military-
technical spheres. We reached a phase of drafting particular
documents, some of which can be signed at a sitting of the Union
Council of Ministers on April 25 and the others -- at a future
Russo-Belarussian summit in Moscow within the framework of the
Supreme State Council," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed some pressing issues on Russian-
Belarussian Union State, such as a Constitutional Act, the Union
State parliament elections, the coming sitting of the Union
Council of Ministers and synchronized actions by Russia and
Belarus in the economy, foreign policy and defense.
</P>
<P>
Defense and political plans cannot have a shaky economic
foundation, so economy is the key area of the implementation of
the Union Treaty, Putin noted.
</P>
<P>
"It is, primarily, a matter of common tax policy, common
customs space and similar tariff regulations," he stated.
</P>
<P>
However, "what we are doing, we are building a union country,
is a grandiose project. There must be no rush in such affairs," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Putin arrived in Minsk on Sunday for a working visit, later he
will travel to London and Kiev.

HARARE, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Sunday said he wants the fifth parliamentary elections to be held
sooner than the minimum three months required by the Delimitation
Commission.
</P>
<P>
He said the minimum three months, which the Delimitation
Commission said it needed to demarcate the 120 constituencies,
was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
The president had announced that the elections would be held in
May, but Chairman of the Delimitation Commission Justice Sandura
said he needed a minimum of three months to complete the
exercise, meaning that the elections could only be held after
July.
</P>
<P>
"We want the elections. We are not afraid of anything. If
anyone is nervous, it is not the ruling Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf). We want the elections now," the
president told thousands of his supporters who had thronged the
Harare International Airport to welcome him back from Cuba.

Mugabe joined other heads of state and government in Cuba for

<HEADLINE> WFP Chief Assesses Djibouti Port Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Catherine Bertini, executive
director of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) has
inspected the facilities at port of Djibouti, which is to play a
crucial role in getting food aid to famine-stricken Ethiopians,
said sources reaching here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Bertini Saturday arrived in Djibouti from Addis Ababa where she
said late Friday that additional food aid would definitely be
needed in Ethiopia, the country worst hit by the drought which has
also ravaged Greater Horn of Africa, including Somalia, Djibouti,
Eritrea and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The WFP estimates that 12.4 million people have been affected
by the drought, 7.8 million of them in Ethiopia, 2.4 million in
Kenya, 1.2 million in Somalia, 367,000 in Eritrea, 200,000 in
Uganda, 100,000 in Djibouti and 33,000 in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The UN agency believes that 940,000 tons of food aid will be
needed to stave off mass starvation in the region this year.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the aid to Ethiopia will be shipped via the Port of
Djibouti,
</P>
<P>
and to a lesser extent Berbera Port of Somalia, Ethiopia said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian leaders have definitely rejected to ship humanitarian
aid via Eritrea's ports of Assab and Massawa which were used by
Ethiopia before the Ethio-Eritrean conflict erupted in May of
1998.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has been using Djibouti for its international
commerce ever since its war against neighboring Eritrea broke
out.
</P>
<P>
 It was reported that Beritni left Djibouti for Eritrea late
Saturday. She will go on to Kenya next week.

coming years.
</P>
<P>
The local Walta Information Center Sunday quoted Desta
Alamirew, an expert of malaria and vector-borne diseases, as

</P>
<P>
Water filtering materials are being distributed twice a year to
the people living in pro-disease areas to protect them from being
caught by the disease, Desta said.

</P>
<P>
The environmental watchdog said while it strongly supported
equitable land distribution, the destruction of trees by farm
invaders was harming the ecological balance.
</P>
<P>
In numerous cases, it said many indigenous trees have been cut
down as landless peasants cleared land for cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Due to unbalanced land distribution, Environment 2000 Secretary
General Charlene Hewat said the country was already experiencing
widespread land degradation particularly in over-populated rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
To avoid the mistakes of the past, she said, it was essential
that all concerned parties came together to implement a planned
and sustainable land distribution program where it was a priority
to protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
War veterans of Zimbabwe's 1970s independence struggle together
with landless peasants have in the last few months invaded about
1,000 commercial farms.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists said they had left a trail of destruction as
they cut down trees to peg their shares of invaded portions of
land.
</P>
<P>
Fuel shortages which have hit the country since last December
have worsened the situation as the majority of people who depend
on paraffin resort to firewood, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Former Zambian President Calls for Mozambique Debt Cancellation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian president
Kenneth Kaunda on Sunday joined Southern African Development
Community (SADC) parliamentarians at a special church service to
call for the world community to cancel Mozambique's international
debt.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, seen as a senior statesman in Africa, told the
gathering in Cape Town's St George's Cathedral that the debt had
largely stemmed from Mozambique's fight against apartheid and
racism.
</P>
<P>
The need to cancel Mozambique's debt has become more urgent as
the country's problems had been exacerbated by the devastating
floods in February, he was quoted as saying by South African Press
Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It is now time for the world to repay its debt to
Mozambique," Kaunda said.

<HEADLINE> S.African Minister Wants to Convey Correct Anti-AIDS Message </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Music and dance are perfect
vehicles to convey AIDS awareness to people in rural areas, South
African Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He told competitors of the African Cultural Music and Dance
Association HIV/AIDS competition in Soweto, Johannesburg that
these forms of expression could tell the story of the AIDS
epidemic to illiterate people or those who did not have
information resources available to them.
</P>
<P>
"Through every song performed and every musical piece
presented, through every dance and every subtle movement, the
truth is being spoken about the devastation of the HIV/AIDS
epidemic," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Even television and radio are not widely accessible. If we
are to get the message of HIV/AIDS into these communities, we must
choose a means which conveys the truth directly from person to
person."
</P>
<P>
Music and dance would increase AIDS awareness in rural
communities, traditional groups in townships and inner city
hostels who were key to the success of the AIDS campaign,
Buthelezi was quoted by South African Press Association as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Starts Applications for Presidential Candidacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The applications for presidential
candidacy started in Turkey on Sunday as Mehmet Buyukerman, a
lawmaker from Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's Democratic Left Party
(DSP) presented himself as the first candidate.
</P>
<P>
When asked if he got the approval of his party leader,
Buyukerman said that "we are a democratic party. Ecevit can
understand me, and this is a constitutional right for people to be
a candidate."
</P>
<P>
With the failure of a constitutional amendment promoted by
Ecevit to give President Suleyman Demirel a second term in office,
a new president should be elected by the parliament before May 15.
Demirel's term in office expires on May 16.
</P>
<P>
Deputies who are over 40 years and have completed their higher
education are eligible to be candidates while the nomination of a
candidate for the presidency from outside the parliament shall
require a written proposal signed by at least one-fifth, namely
110, deputies.
</P>
<P>
The application to the parliament's speaker's Office for
candidacy will end at 24:00 local time (2100 GMT) on April 25.
</P>
<P>
The Parliamentary Advisory Board will convene and determine the
date of voting.
</P>
<P>
Any presidential candidate who can garner a two-thirds majority,
namely 367 votes, in the 550-member parliament in either of the
first two votings will win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
If no one can get a two-thirds majority, a third ballot will be
held and a simple majority is required for a candidate to win.
</P>
<P>
Should no candidate receive the required votes, a fourth voting
will be introduced for the top two votes receivers and 276 votes
are needed to be elected as the president.
</P>
<P>
If the four rounds of voting fail to elect a president, the
parliament will be dissolved and a general election be held.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Retail Sales Drop in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total retail sales
value dropped to 1.919 billion Singapore dollars (1.122 billion U.
S. dollars) in February this year, plunging by 33.8 percent
compared with the previous month, the Singapore Department of
Statistics (SDS) said in its monthly bulletin.
</P>
<P>
But the February figure was 9.9 percent higher over the same
month of 1999 and excluding motor vehicles, the retail index in
February shrank by 22.9 percent over January, SDS said.
</P>
<P>
SDS said almost all retail activities reported lower sales in
February, with retailers of food and beverages and furniture and
household equipment leading others by experiencing significantly
slower business of 42.1 percent and 36 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin shows that except telecommunication and computers
which registered a slight increase of 0.6 percent in February, all
other retail activities recorded double-digit contractions in
sales.
</P>
<P>
SDS attributed February's sharp drop mainly to declining motor
vehicles sales which plunged by 50.1 percent over January, and the
shorter month of February.
</P>
<P>
SDS also said the overall catering trade index in February
declined by 2.3 percent over January but rose by 6.3 percent
compared with the same month of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Interac PIN Pad Out of Canadian Stores after Exploded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Canada Safeway and 50 other major
retailers have pulled thousands of debit-card keypads from their
stores after the Bank of Montreal reported one "melted down" last
week.
</P>
<P>
Canadian media Sunday continued to ask customers not to use the
Interac PIN pads at any of the grocery outlets across the country.
</P>
<P>
Checkout counters at Canada Safeway were reported to slow to a
snail's pace Saturday after its chain of 212 stores recalled more
than 3,000 suspect pads.
</P>
<P>
The palm-sized terminals are being put out of use following a
warning Friday by its owner, the Bank of Montreal, that one of the
PIN pads exploded at a store in Vancouver, British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
"It overheated and fell off its stand and started smoking -- it
basically melted down," Bank of Montreal spokesman Joe Barbera
said.
</P>
<P>
The pads mounted at cash registers were between four-and eight-
years-old and they would be replaced within two weeks, according
to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The bank started telling retailers to remove all similar
keypads Friday afternoon when it got back test results on the
faulty unit that revealed a design flaw in the battery compartment.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Montreal is leasing about 11,000 keypads
manufactured by a defunct company called Atalla, local media
reported.

<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Several well-known Chinese
websites entered a web alliance today to protect the Tibetan
antelopes from extinction.
</P>
<P>
The websites include Chinaren.com and east.cn.net, whose fund-

university students in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan antelope, one of the top priorities on China's
protected species list, is an endangered species. The animals live
in the grassland in and around Qinghai, the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region and Tibet Autonomous Region. They are usually
found in the mountains between 3,700 and 5,500 meters high.
</P>
<P>
According to wildlife experts, the number of Tibetan antelopes
has fallen from about 50,000 to 75,000 in 1995 to the present 30,
000.

Chinese newspaper, will carry an observer's article revealing the
true purpose of the statements made by Taiwan's Annette Lu in her
interview with a Hong Kong cable TV in which she advocated "
independence" for the island.
</P>
<P>
The article says that Lu advocated separatism between the
Taiwan people and the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"No matter where Chinese come from, be that Beijing, Shanghai
or Taiwan, we are all Chinese and members of the big family of
Chinese nation," the article says.
</P>
<P>
Lu's allegation denies that Taiwan is an inseparable part of
China and that the people of Taiwan are an inseparable part of the
Chinese nation, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Lu attempted to provoke animosity between the people on both
sides of the Taiwan Straits by calling Taiwan people the "
scapegoats of a civil war between Kuomintang and the Communist
Party of China", the article says.
</P>
<P>
The temporary separation of Taiwan and the mainland cannot
change the fact that there is only one China in the world and that
Taiwan is part of China, the article says, and the separation will
inevitably come to an end.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's future resides in its reunification with the
motherland, the article says. The separatists' attempts to
separate Taiwan from the motherland will do harm to the
fundamental interests of the entire Chinese nation including the
people in Taiwan, it says.

Lu alleged that the relationship between the mainland and
Taiwan should be that of "remote relatives" in terms of history
and when geographical factors are considered, they are "close
neighbors," according to the article.
</P>
<P>
It is internationally acknowledged that there is only one China,
the article says. Over 160 countries have set up diplomatic ties
with China, and they all recognize that Taiwan is an inalienable
part of China, and the government of the People's Republic of
China is the sole legitimate government of China, the article says.
"The question facing us now is how to let Taiwan return to the
motherland at an early date, and realize the reunification of the
motherland," it says.
</P>
<P>
The article says that on the one hand, Lu drummed up Taiwan's "
independence", and on the other hand, she called for talks to
communicate with the mainland. Lu has contradicted herself because
the Chinese Government has stressed again and again that the one-
China principle is the prerequisite for any talks across the
Straits.

JERUSALEM, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Transportation Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai is facing indictment on three counts of sexual

women, police spokeswoman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The police investigation team for the case ended their probe
Sunday afternoon and turned the findings to the State Attorney's
Office, saying that they collected enough evidence to support their
recommendations to charge Mordechai with indecent sexual acts with
force.
</P>
<P>
The first complaint against Mordechai, a former defense
minister, surfaced on March 7, when a 23-year-old ministry staff
worker in Mordechai's office sobbed out to police that the minister
had sexually assaulted her in his Tel Aviv office for several
times.
</P>
<P>
After the police began to investigate the case, two other women
submitted their own complaints against Mordechai about sexually
harassment acts in November 1996 and in October 1992 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai claimed Sunday afternoon that he is innocent.
</P>
<P>
Two of Mordechai's confidants, his bureau chief Michal Kallah
and his driver Meir Ohayun, are also recommended by police to face
indictment on obstruction of justice because their role in the
case.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Jordanian Leaders Discuss Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met
visiting Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein Sunday to examine
the "difficult" conditions on the three tracks of the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Information Minister Safwat el Sharif said the Mubarak-
Abdullah meeting came within the context of consultations, exchange
of views and coordination between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He also said Abdullah, who arrived here earlier in the day, has
returned to Jordan after a brief visit.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Middle East was the focal topic of their
discussions in light of the difficult conditions the peace process
is experiencing on its three tracks, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders examined the problems and stumbling blocks as
well as the views of the various parties concerned, he added.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Israel Keeps Boycott of Monitoring Group in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel will keep on suspending
its role in the five-nation committee monitoring conflicts in south
Lebanon, Israeli military sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israel has to weigh its membership in the committee as long as
Lebanese "terrorist organizations" continue violating the
understandings, a statement issued by Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
said.
</P>
<P>
The government has informed the committee that it will not
return until calm is to be maintained in south Lebanon for a period
of at least one or two weeks without infringements of the
understandings, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The Grapes of Wrath group, comprising representatives from the
United States, France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel, was formed in
April, 1996 under the truce understandings reached between Israel
and Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas, who are fighting to end Israeli
occupation of the so-called security zone in south Lebanon since
1985.
</P>
<P>
Israel accused Hezbollah and other resistant militias of keeping
firing into Israel's populated areas in the north and defying the
understandings, which prohibit attacks on or from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the Lebanese government and the Hezbollah usually
charge Israel with trampling on the understandings by launching air
strikes against Lebanese civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government lodged three complaints with the
monitoring group on Friday and Saturday regarding Lebanese
guerrillas' attacks from civilian villages outside the security
zone, which Israel set up in 1985 with a self-claimed aim to
protect its north from cross border attacks.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the strategy of a buffer zone turned out
to be a failure as the resistant militias caused mounting
casualties of IDF soldiers in the zone.
</P>
<P>
In February, Israeli delegation withdrew from a session of the
Grapes of Wrath committee after an Israeli soldier was killed by
Hezbollah, the seventh since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Since then, heavy exchanges of fire between IDF and Lebanese
gunmen have become a routine affair in the security zone.
</P>
<P>
To end the nightmare once and for all, the Israeli cabinet
approved a proposal made by Barak on March 5 to carry out a
withdrawal from the zone by July, with or without security
arrangements with Syria, the major power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Tourism Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, a former IDF chief
of general staff, said recently that in such a context, the
monitory group is fast losing its effectiveness.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Assured of Saudi Support in Struggle Against Israeli Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile
Lahoud ended his two-day visit to Saudi Arabia Sunday, securing the
Saudi support in his country's struggle to halt Israel's continuous
attacks on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud, who arrived in the Gulf kingdom Saturday on the first
leg of his seven-nation tour of Arab states and Iran, held talks
late Saturday with Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz, and Crown Prince
and Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed the latest developments in the Middle
East peace process and Israel's planned withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has announced unilaterally that it will pull back by July
from South Lebanon, which has been occupied by Israel since its
invasion of the tiny Middle East state in June 1982.
</P>
<P>
A Saudi government official said after the talks that Riyadh
will rally support to force Israel to respect peace agreements and
halt its repeated attacks against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia blamed Israel for the current deadlock in the peace
process and will contact concerned parties to pressure Israel to
abide by the signed peace agreements, halt its aggression against
Lebanon and withdraw from South Lebanon in line wi international
resolutions, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi-Lebanese talks also covered ways of boosting bilateral
political and economic ties, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud thanked Fahd for his country's support for Lebanon during
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Apart from political support, Saudi Arabia also has offered
great financial help to Lebanon. The latest Saudi figures show that
Riyadh, represented by the Saudi Development Fund (SDF), is
currently financing development projects worth 1 billion Saudi
Riyals (266 million U.S. dollars) in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The projects include renovation of educational and health care
institutions, implementation of road and water projects, and
construction of sports facilities.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia was also the largest Arab importer from Lebanon in
October 1999, when it imported goods of 6 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the field of tourism, Saudis still occupy the first place in
the list of foreign tourists going to Lebanon. Last year, over 80,
000 Saudi tourists visited Lebanon, representing 12 percent of the
total 673,000 foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud's next stop is Kuwait. He will also visit the United Arab
Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, Egypt and Iran.

<HEADLINE> WB Criticized for Meddling in Third World Counties' Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) was severely
criticized by Bangladeshi business leaders at a dialogue here
Sunday for its "wanton interference" in the affairs of the third
world countries.
</P>
<P>
"The World Bank should be abolished because this global
institution is in fact adding miseries in the third world
countries through pressing its prescriptions instead of
contributing to their development in real term," Abdul Awal Mintoo,
president of the Federation of the Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce
and Industry (FBCCI), said at the dialogue organized by the
Economic Reporters' Forum.
</P>
<P>
At the Bangladesh Development Forum held on April 13 and 14 in
Paris, the WB and Bangladesh's development partners made severe
criticisms on the "poor governance and prevailing corruption" in
the country, adding that the actual level of assistance will
depend on progress in policy and institutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
The WB said in a draft report discussed at the forum that
Bangladesh could add 2.1 to 2.9 percent to its annual Gross
Domestic Product growth if it could reduce corruption level to
those in countries with the highest reputation for honest dealing.
</P>
<P>
FBCCI President Mintoo said at the dialogue that the
bureaucrats of the WB had always been in the dark about the actual
situation at the grass-roots levels in countries like Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
With a kind of hypothetical ideas, they designed their programs
and tried to enforce them on the country, Mintoo added.
</P>
<P>
He vehemently opposed the WB's "big-brotherly" attitude toward
third world countries, saying the institution must not be allowed
to poke its nose into a country's internal affairs as it would
amount to interfering in the sovereignty of the country.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the country's present state of economy, Mintoo
said that whoever is in power, the need of the hour is a radical
reform side by side deregulation, allowing the private sector to
grow to help the national economy reap good results.
</P>
<P>
The FBCCI chief also strongly pleaded for reforms of policies
and elimination of bureaucracy, urging all parties to create a
wider atmosphere for desired growth of the national economy.

<HEADLINE> Indian Troops Repulse Militant Attack In Kashmir </HEADLINE>

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President not to Order War Veterans off Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Sunday said he will not order the war veterans to withdraw from
the commercial farms they have been occupying.
</P>
<P>
"All the British newspapers were expecting me to order the war
veterans to leave the farms. I will not say that and I will not do
that. Why should they leave the land now. They should wait for
the law to be implemented and only then," Mugabe said to a
resounding applause.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing thousands of his supporters, mainly war
veterans from all the provinces, who had thronged Harare
International Airport to welcome him back from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe's statement contradicts the announcement made by
Vice-President Joseph Msika, who was Acting President during the
period when Mugabe attended a Group of 77 economic summit in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Msika ordered war veterans on Thursday to withdraw from the
farms to clear the way for an orderly resettlement, adding that it
was no longer necessary for the former freedom fighters to
continue occupying the farms.
</P>
<P>
However, in his address at the airport in front of the VIP
lounge, Mugabe supported the war veterans who continued to defy
the High Court ruling and vowed to continuously occupy the
white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
With Mugabe's statement, some of the war veterans, particularly
the ones in Mashonaland West who had started to withdraw, will
re-occupy the farms.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe dismissed the recent High Court ruling ordering the
government and the police to move in and assist in the eviction of
thousands of villagers and former freedom fighters who have
invaded white-owned commercial farms, saying the issue was
political and therefore needed a political solution.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We respect the law of the courts but we as members of
the government regard the political problems as overriding the
little law of trespassing. The land issue is not a problem that
can be corrected by the law but by the government and people of
Zimbabwe."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe promised that the issue would be resolved when the
recent amendment to the constitution became law, which he said
would be sometime this week.
</P>
<P>
"We will sit with the war veterans and cooperating commercial
farmers and work out a strategy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The amendment allows the government to compulsorily acquire
land without compensation and it makes provision for the British
government to pay the compensation.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said although he respected the courts, the land should
be resolved by the politicians, not the courts.
</P>
<P>
He said ordering the police to the farms could lead to more
violent clashes and may be loss of life, something which the
government is trying to avoid.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he will not order the police to evict the war
veterans.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe and Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa contradicted
each other in February on whether the government would interfere
with the invasions by the war veterans.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans have occupied about 1,000 white-owned
commercial farms since February this year.

<HEADLINE> N. Ireland's Protestant Leader Plans Orange Order Split </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- David Trimble, leader of Northern
Ireland's largest Protestant, pro-British party, is planning to
curb the influence of the 8,000-strong Protestant Orange Order
within it, a British newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He intended to propose reforms that could prevent the hard-line
Orange Order and other groups that oppose the landmark Good Friday
peace agreement from sending delegates to the policy-making
council of his Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), the Sunday Telegraph
reported.
</P>
<P>
Trimble, who last month rebuffed a strong leadership challenge
from an anti-peace agreement parliament member, Martin Smyth, said
the move had been planned for some months.
</P>
<P>
Trimble defeated the Orange Order-backed Smyth in a close
competition for the party's leadership last month. Trimble won 57
percent of the vote against 43 percent for Smyth.
</P>
<P>
"This is not something dreamed up in response to last month's ..
. result. These discussions have been ongoing for a number of
months," he said.
</P>
<P>
The move would affect the strong ties that have linked the
Ulster Unionists to the Orange Order since the party's formation
in 1905.
</P>
<P>
But the decision to reform the UUP, which would mirror Labor's
attempts to disentangle itself from the trade union movement, is
likely to anger some anti-peace agreement elements within
Trimble's party.
</P>
<P>
Trimble told the paper that he intended to put the reform
proposals to the UUP's rules revision committee in June, ahead of
the Orange Order's July 12 celebrations.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing
arrived here Sunday for a three-day official visit to the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement distributed to the press at the airport,
Li said his visit is aimed at further improving friendly relations
and cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that this visit will attain the goals of deepening
mutual understanding, enhancing mutual trust, broadening common
ground and promoting cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Li said China is happy with the fact that the two countries are
expanding and deepening cooperation in various fields such as
economics and trade, science and technology, culture, and
education.
</P>
<P>
He said the two peoples have enjoyed "age-old friendly
exchanges."
</P>
<P>
"The past few years have witnessed an increase in the exchange
of visits at various levels between our two countries. The
successful visit to China by Her Excellency Queen Beatrix last
April, in particular, has served as a great impetus to the
development of China-Netherlands relations."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier said he is looking forward to an
extensive exchange of views with leaders of the Netherlands on
bilateral relations and issues of mutual interest and to meeting
with business leaders to discuss ways to further strengthen
economic cooperation and trade.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived in Amsterdam after he wound up a visit to Malta.
Before his trip to Malta, the vice premier visited Cuba, where he
also attended the South Summit.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua)-- The Chinese economy has continued
to enjoy healthy growth, with the first quarter's GDP rising 8.1
percent over the same period last year, said Li Rongrong, vice

by issuing 100 billion yuan in state debentures for infrastructure
projects, environmental protection as well as technical upgrading
in enterprises.
</P>

The official said that while discarding policies and
regulations restricting consumption, China will work on a set of
measures to encourage investments and exports. China will also

At the ceremony, Lu Yongxiang, president of CAS, presented a
certification of the naming to Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief executive
of the Macao SAR.
</P>

<HEADLINE> mee0416 hke -- Barak Mulls More Concession in Final-Phase Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said Sunday that he is considering making more concession in
the final-phase withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Briefing his ministers during the weekly cabinet meeting, Barak
said he is mulling the possibility to hand over more West Bank land
to the Palestinians in the final phase pullback, due to be
implemented by June.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the concession, according to Barak's remarks
quoted by Israel Radio, is to show that Israel is not only
interested in talks with the Palestinians, but also in the result
of the talks.
</P>
<P>
After two earlier withdrawals, the territories fully or jointly
controlled by the Palestinians reached nearly 40 percent of the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of the lands to be handed over in the final
redeployment, the last phase under interim accords, had become the
focus of disputes between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Barak's predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, reportedly only agreed
to concede another 1 percent of the West Bank. Barak himself flied
test balloons in the past few weeks through his aides that the size
will be no more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinians insist that according to their Oslo
accords, they should get at the end of the interim period all the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, excluding Jerusalem, several settlement
areas and military bases, whose status should be settled in the
final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat repeatedly stressed that he
would definitely declare Palestinian statehood by September 13,
with or without an agreement with Israelis on permanent status
issues.
</P>
<P>
On Friday reports said Barak appeared ready to recognize a "
demilitarized Palestinian state." Such a Palestinian entity,
according to Barak, should have 70 percent to 80 percent of the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Barak on Sunday furthered his suggestion by telling his cabinet
that a Palestinian entity must have territorial contiguity. "No
serious person believes that an entity can be created in the form
of a protectorate or autonomy made up of various patches on the map
without connections between them," a statement issued by Barak's
office said.
</P>
<P>
Barak also said he would not annex the Arab villages near
Jerusalem such as Abu Dis and Anata, which is not in the municipal
borders of Jerusalem and heavily populated by Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The villages are currently under the joint control of Israel and
the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
Minister in Prime Minister's Office Haim Ramon and Public
Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, two Barak's confidants in the
peace process, revealed earlier in the day that the final-status
talks will surely result in an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators on Saturday ended their
second round of negotiations at Bolling Air Force Base near
Washington, which is designed to resolve the thorniest issues such
as the status of Jerusalem, border, security, water and the return
of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
They are scheduled to reach a framework agreement by mid-May and
a final deal in September.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Foreign Interference in Trial on Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry on Sunday
rejected foreign interference in the trial on 13 Iranian Jews
accused of espionage for Tehran's arch foes -- the United States
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said the comments made by some
foreign officials on the judicial process concerning the trial
are "questionable" and will not help the defendants, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
As already announced, the trial is an internal matter of the
Islamic republic and any interference and prejudgment about it is
rejected, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has warned that the conduct and outcome of the trial
could affect the thaw in relations that began only after the
election of the moderate President Mohammad Khatami in 1997, while
France and Germany have called for a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
The 13 Iranian Jews along with eight Muslims were arrested in
March and April last year on charges of spying for the U.S. and
Israel, who have denied any connection with them.
</P>
<P>
The first session of the trial was held on Thursday at a
revolutionary court in Shiraz, capital of the southern Fars
province, the center of Iran's 35,000-strong Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
The closed-door trial was adjourned and postponed to May 1 upon
the request of a defense lawyer as the timing of the trial
coincided with Passover, a Jewish feast.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said the Iranian Judiciary will handle the case
independently and administer justice concerning the charges brought
up against the accused.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Ali Amiri, head of justice department of the southern
Fars province, on Thursday also promised a "fair, lawful and
impartial" trial for the Jews, and said there is no difference
between Muslim and Jews accused of espionage.
</P>
<P>
He said that four of the accused confessed to their crime in the
first court session and asked for leniency.

<HEADLINE> IRA Offered New "War is Over" Deal: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- London would lift the suspension
of Northern Ireland's home-rule government should the Irish
Republican Army (IRA) announce the "war is over" with Britain, the
Observer newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was raised by Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary
Peter Mandelson as part of a new initiative drawn up between
London and Dublin in order to revive the stalled peace process in
the province, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's departure from 30 years of sectarian
violence halted in February when Mandelson suspended a fledgling
home-rule government after IRA guerrillas showed no sign of
disarming.
</P>
<P>
If the IRA said the war with Britain was over and the Ulster
Unionists agreed with details of the new package designed by
London and Dublin to end the current stand-off, Britain would
allow Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive to resume working,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
But the IRA, the military arm of the Sinn Fein party, should
give a clear commitment to disarmament albeit over a longer period
than was originally intended in the groundbreaking Good Friday
peace agreement, it added.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Northern Ireland Office said that the core
of the new initiative would be to get "clarity" on the disarmament
issue.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, leader of the biggest pro-British Protestant
party, the Ulster Unionists, has said he would share government
with Sinn Fein again as long as the guerrillas made a strong
commitment to disarming.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams warned that he could
not say with certainty that the "war" was over in Northern Ireland.
Sinn Fein insists that Mandelson breached the peace pact by
suspending the province's home-rule government.
</P>
<P>
Guerrilla groups in the British province were supposed to
surrender their arms before May 22. Both the British and Irish
governments conceded that the deadline would have to be missed.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 16 (Xinhua) -- World record holder Sergei Bubka
said he would retire after the Sydney Olympic Games starting on
September 15, local newspaper reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But the 37-year-old Ukrainian vowed to win the Olympic pole
vault gold before he ends his honorable career, according to the
Kommersant.
</P>
<P>
"I'll compete in some warm-ups before I set off for the Olympic
gold in Sydney," the 1988 Seoul Olympics goldlist was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The five-time world champion missed the track for one and a
half years for an injured heel and recovered for training in March
in France.
</P>
<P>
Bubka, who set an Olympic record of 6.03 meters in Seoul, South
Korea, failed to claim the same mark in the 1992 Barcelona
Olympics and missed the 1996 Atlanta Games because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
Starting his brilliant career in 1983 when he was 19, Bubka
broke the world records for 35 times and holds the world indoor
mark of 6.15 meters, set on Feburary 21, 1993.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide publicity drive was
launched today by the China National Consumers Association and
the China National Tourism Association to inform tourists of ways
to protecting their rights and obligations.
</P>
<P>
Xidan, Beijing's booming commercial street, served as the main
site of today's activities, with China's top 20 travel services as
well as overseas tourist institutions including those from
Australia, Singapore, Thailand and Hong Kong participating.
</P>
<P>
Officials from these services and institutions issued pamphlets
to passers-by and provided travel information.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of life standards and the increase of state-
approved holidays in China has witnessed rapid development in the
tourist sector. Statistics indicate that last year, more than 700
million Chinese people traveled in China while 1.93 million people
traveled abroad.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of complaints put forward by tourists also
went up, mainly due to poor services on the part of travel
agencies and lack of travel-related knowledge from tourists.
</P>
<P>
Cao Tiandian, head of the Consumers Association, said that
tourists should be cautious in choosing a travel agent because
there are illegal travel operators.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jianzhong, deputy-director of the Management Department
of China National Tourism Administration, said that China will
further enhance quality control in the tourism sector, vowing to
severely punish those who cheat tourists. At a press conference
here today, he publicized a new hotline telephone number of CNTA,
which will listen to complaints from tourists. The phone number is:
010-65275315.

matter they are alive or have been martyred," he said, calling on
the Iraqi government to allow representatives of the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit POW camps and prisons in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Accusing Baghdad of suspending bilateral talks on the POW issue,
Najafi said that Tehran is serious and sincere in solving the POW
problem with Iraq as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran released 1,999 Iraqi POWs last week under an
agreement with the ICRC, which promised to follow up the case of
Iranian POWs and to inform Tehran of the result in a month.
</P>
<P>
Iran had announced to release 2,000 Iraqi POWs in a bid to speed
up the settlement of the POW issue between the two countries, the
officer said, but one of them refused to return home and sought
asylum in Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tehran has so far released 57,712 Iraqi POWs on 105
occasions while Baghdad freed 39,417 Iranians on 70 occasions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq handed over three lists to Iran in 1998 claiming the
existence of 20,743 Iraqi POWs in Iran, but over 10,000 had been
released in recent years while 9,000 others refused to return home,
Najafi said.
</P>
<P>
All the Iraqi POWs registered by the ICRC have been released, he
said, refusing to give the exact number of Iraqi POWs stilled held
in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Najafi also rejected the recent accusation by Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein that Iran had tortured and murdered some Iraqi POWs
by using methods worse than the Nazis during the World War II.
</P>
<P>
Iraq claimed that it has repatriated all Iranian POWs except
64 "criminals" who were arrested after the Gulf war.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Budget Crisis Affects Missions Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's 2000 budget crisis
resulting in pervasive cash crunch has taken toll on its missions
abroad as most of them can not meet their financial commitments.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, quoted diplomatic
sources as disclosing on Sunday that the situation in some
missions has been so bad that even salaries cannot be paid.
</P>
<P>
To underscore the seriousness of the financial crunch, two of
Nigeria's envoys recently had to abandon their duty posts and come
to Abuja to complain and beg for money, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
This year's federal budget was long delayed in passage by the
country's top legislature and was yet signed by the president due
to differences between the two sides on certain items of
expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic missions are worried about the implications of
these handicaps on Nigeria's image, which has just suffered some
bashing over Nigerian leader's trip to Cuba on a commercial
flight, due to a veto by the National Assembly to the president's
request for a new jet.

LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Portugal's Antonio Pinto set a new
course record and European best to win the men's London marathon
with a time of two hours six minutes and 36 seconds on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old star, who has never been out of the first three

field and never looked in danger of being caught on the way to the
victory, the fifth fastest time ever recorded for a marathon.

<P>
Defending champion, Abdelkader El Mouaziz of Morocco, was
almost one minute slower. Khalid Khannouchi, who after just three
marathons had never been beaten, finished third in 2:08.36.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Josia Thugwane of South Africa, although
finishing in eighth place, clocked 2:10.29, was guaranteed the
chance to defend his title in Sydney.

off Loroupe or Simon as the elite field went over Tower Bridge.

Loroupe reduced Norwegian Ingrid Kristiansen's world record to
2:20:47 aided by male pacemakers in the 1998 Rotterdam marathon

less than 10 million to 15 millions per year.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- Tunisian Industry Minister, al-Munsif Bin Abdullah said

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Opposition Accused of Betraying Political Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's ruling Chama Cha
 Mapinduzi (CCM) party has accused the opposition Civic United
Front (CUF) of betraying the Commonwealth-brokered political
accord.
</P>
<P>
The document is aimed at ending the political stalemate in the
semi- autonomous Zanzibar region, the official Sunday News
reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Friday night, the CCM's Deputy
Secretary General in Zanzibar Hassan Mussa Takrima said the CUF's
opposition to a bill on the proposed Isles constitutional
amendment is a violation of the accord itself.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth-brokered agreement, which were signed by the
two parties in June 1999, calls for the reforms of the Zanzibar
Electoral Commission (ZEC) as an enhancement of its technical
competence to ensure future elections free of controversy.
</P>
<P>
The bill also sought immunity of the president from
prosecutions while in office and after his office terms.
</P>
<P>
The CUF had from the outset no intention to respect the accord
aimed at restoring normal political life in the Isles, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Takrima said the CUF's move on signing of the agreed memorandum
with the CCM is a ploy to hoodwink the people and the world into
believing that they wanted to bury the hatchet and open a new
chapter of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the proposed constitutional bill was intended
to consolidate democracy and restore political order for the sake
of people's development in the island state off mainland Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The rejection of the bill means the current constitution which
is the center of criticism would remain in force, said Takrima.
</P>
<P>
In a roll call held in the Zanzibar House of Representatives on
Friday, all the 47 CCM legislators supported the bill while all
the 24 CUF legislators rejected it, making it impossible to get
the support of at least 50 House members.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar joined with mainland Tanganyika to form the United
Republic of Tanzania in 1964. But it has its own government and
parliament. Zanzibar' s CCM, under President Salmin Amour,
claimed a narrow victory over the CUF in the 1995 elections, but
the CUF questioned the result.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Continue Support for Indonesia's Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori assured visiting Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid on
Sunday that Japan has not altered its policy of supporting
Indonesia's reform efforts despite the recent change in Japan's
premiership.
</P>
<P>
Mori told Wahid that Japan will continue to support Indonesia's
economic reconstruction and its efforts to resolve problems over
separatist activities in Aceh and religious strife in the Maluku
Islands, Kyodo news agency quoted a Japanese government official
as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Mori said Japan will continue to support
Indonesia's reform efforts by, for example, holding the next
meeting of major aid donors in Japan in the fall.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting in February, the Consultative Group on Indonesia
pledged up to 4.7 billion dollars in new aid to help fund
Indonesia's projected budget deficit. Of the pledges, Japan
committed the most at 1.56 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mori also urged Indonesia to implement a reform program under
the International Monetary Fund. Wahid promised to do so, saying
it is a step that is necessary for his country to gain the
confidence of the international community, according to Kyodo.
</P>
<P>
Mori reiterated Japan's position of seeking "the integrity of
Indonesia" in respect to separatist activities in Aceh and the
sectarian strife in the Maluku Islands. He also urged Wahid to
exert strong leadership in resolving problems over East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said he plans to meet East Timorese independence leader
Xanana Gusmao for talks on his way to or from his planned visit to
Australia, the Japanese official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the two leaders announced members of a new
panel of Japanese and Indonesian experts to advise the two leaders
on a wide range of issues, including foreign policy and
international finance. The Japan-Indonesia Advisory Network,
consisting of 10 experts, plans to meet twice a year.
</P>
<P>
Wahid and former Japanese prime minister Keizo Obuchi agreed to
launch the panel when they met last November.
</P>
<P>
Wahid made a stopover in Japan on his way back from a 10-day
trip to South Africa, Mexico and Cuba.

<P>
More than 200 police dog handlers from over 10 provinces and
regions of China gathered in Harbin on April 10 to begin a six-
month program on training for border patrol.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Iraq to Clarify Fate of Remaining POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official on Sunday
Urged Iraq to clarify the fate of remaining 3,000 Iranian prisoners
of war (POWs) left over from the 1980-88 war between the two
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Brigadier General Abdollah
Najafi, head of the Iranian special commission in charge of POWs,
said that Iran has documents and evidences to prove the existence
of about the 3,000 Iranian POWs in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Iran wants the fate of the Iranian POWs to be clarified, no
matter they are alive or have been martyred," he said, calling on
the Iraqi government to allow representatives of the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit POW camps and prisons in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Accusing Baghdad of suspending bilateral talks on the POW issue,
Najafi said that Tehran is serious and sincere in solving the POW
problem with Iraq as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran released 1,999 Iraqi POWs last week under an
agreement with Iraq, which promised to follow up the case of
Iranian POWs and to inform Tehran of the result in a month.
</P>
<P>
Iran had announced to release 2,000 Iraqi POWs in a bid to speed
up the settlement of the POW issue between the two countries, the
officer said, but one of them refused to return home and sought
asylum in Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tehran has so far released 57,712 Iraqi POWs on 105
occasions while Baghdad freed 39,417 Iranians on 70 occasions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq handed over three lists to Iran in 1998 claiming the
existence of 20,743 Iraqi POWs in Iran, but over 10,000 had been
released in recent years while 9,000 others refused to return home,
Najafi said.
</P>
<P>
All the Iraqi POWs registered by the ICRC have been released, he
said, refusing to give the exact number of Iraqi POWs stilled held
in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Najafi also rejected the recent accusation by Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein that Iran had tortured and murdered some Iraqi POWs
by using methods worse than the Nazis during the World War II.
</P>
<P>
Iraq claimed that it has repatriated all Iranian POWs except
64 "criminals" who were arrested after the Gulf war.

<HEADLINE> Israel Invites U.S. Team to Define Border with Lebanon: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel will invited an expert
team of the United States Defense Department to help it map out the
exact borderline with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The team is due to arrive in the region at the invitation of
Israeli government in the coming days to begin work immediately,
the Jerusalem Post daily quoted Israeli Defense Ministry sources as
saying on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The idea was reportedly the result of consultations in
Washington last week between U.S. defense officials and an Israeli
delegation, headed by Defense Ministry Deputy Director-General
Moshe Kochanovsky and officials from the Israel Defense Forces
(IDF) cartography department.
</P>
<P>
It is a further preventive move for carrying out Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's strategic concept of withdrawing Israeli
soldiers from the so-called security zone in south Lebanon by July,
even without a peace deal with Syria, the major power broker in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The buffer zone was set up by Israel in 1985 with a self-claimed
aim to protect its north from cross border guerrilla attack. But
the mounting casualties in the area spurred a growing public
pressure for a pullout.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Israeli cabinet decided to back Barak's pledge to
redeploy troops to the international border with Lebanon by July,
with or without security arrangements with Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the question of where the borderline exactly lies
between the two countries had surfaced on the table of Barak and
some IDF senior officials.
</P>
<P>
According to a unilateral withdrawal plan drafted by IDF, code-
named "Morning Twilight", Israeli troops will withdraw to the 1978
borderline, leaving some large outposts in Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
The plan has invited fierce criticism both at home and abroad.
Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas and other resistance groups
threatened to keep fight for ending Israeli occupation, even only
on one inch of Lebanese soil.
</P>
<P>
In response, Barak insisted that IDF should revised the plan to
leave no pretext for attacks against Israel's northern settlements
and win more international sympathy and legitimacy for the
pullback.
</P>
<P>
However, the thorny problem is still not totally resolved, as
there are serious differences over the exact borderline.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese officials claimed that the IDF should be deployed to
the 1923 international border between them, while Israel sticks to
its claim to withdraw to the boundary where IDF soldiers stationed
on the eve of moving into southern Lebanon on June 14, 1978.
</P>
<P>
It is still not clear whether Lebanon will compromise to agree
to a boundary demarcated by U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
To play safe, Israel has been trying to garner support from the
United Nations to endorse its unilateral redeployment in the past
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy will travel to New York in May to
present to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan an official letter
outlining Israel's planed withdrawal on the basis of U.N. Security
Council Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which was passed in 1978, calls for an immediate
and unconditional Israeli pullout from all Lebanese territory and a
return of full sovereignty to Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Philippines on Track for Balanced Budget: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Sunday that it remains on track to achieving a balanced budget
before President Joseph Estrada ends his six-year term in 2004.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Secretary Benjamin Diokno of the
Department of Budget and Management said that the government is
working to achieve this goal by 2003.
</P>
<P>
"Our plan is to have a balanced budget by 2003, and a surplus
before the president's term ends in 2004," Diokno said.
</P>
<P>
He added the surplus by 2004 would not be like the supposed
excess fund left behind by the past administration, which got its
"surplus" by not paying contractors.
</P>
<P>
Diokno said that the government is able to push its social
programs to help the poor uplift their standard of living by
depending on revenue collection.
</P>
<P>
The country's budget deficit for 2000 is 62.5 billion pesos (1.
5 billion U.S. dollars), or 1.8 percent of its gross national
product (GNP), he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country's deficit was 112 billion pesos (2.8
billion dollars), or 3.6 percent of its GNP.
</P>
<P>
For the first quarter of 2000, Diokno said, the government
appears to be on its way to achieving these goals with the over-
performance of its revenue-generating agencies.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Internal Revenue collected 83.2 billion pesos (2
billion dollars), while the Bureau of Customs got 21.7 billion
pesos (542 million dollars), registering respective surpluses of 5.
2 billion pesos (130 million dollars) and 1.9 billion pesos (47
million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urged to Improve Educational System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has been
urged to improve educational system by increasing the proportion
of resources allocated to the sector, Sunday Times of Zambia
reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, two visiting British members of
parliament (MPs) have described the Zambian educational system as
a disaster.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Glenys Kinnock, one of the MPs, as saying at a press
briefing in Lusaka on Saturday it was sad to learn that about
665,000 school-age children in Zambia have never seen the inside
of a classroom.
</P>
<P>
Kinnock urged the Zambian government to prioritize basic
education by investing more money in it.
</P>
<P>
She noted that on the average Africa only spent 3.5 percent of
its Gross Domestic Production (GDP) on education while Zambia only
spent 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
It was imperative for the Zambian government to prioritize
education, especially at the basic education level to ensure as
many children as possible were equipped with basic literacy and
numeracy skills, she said.
</P>
<P>
And Oona King, the other British MP, said education was
interlinked to economic growth and stability and in the absence of
these, good governance, transparency and accountability would be
difficult to achieve.
</P>
<P>
King also expressed concern at the alarming toll which the
HIV/AIDS pandemic had on the country's education system and that
if not adequately addressed, the system risked collapsing.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Sub-Saharan Africa is the only part of
the developing world in which the number of children out of school
is increasing.
</P>
<P>
If the current trend continues, there will be 57 million
primary school-age children out of school in 2015, it quoted King
as saying.

kilograms of heroin with a street value of 7.5 million Jordanian

country via Jordan, Director of the Public Security Department
Dhaher Fawwaz was quoted as saying by the paper.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak indicated to U.S. President
Bill Clinton last week that, under a final-status agreement, Israel
would be willing to recognize a Palestinian state on 70 to 80
percent of the West Bank land, a source in the Prime Minister's
Office confirmed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that, although no exact details on the size of
the state were laid out by Barak, the leaders discussed various
informal proposals of the past.
</P>
<P>
These included a proposal by Regional Cooperation Minister
Shimon Peres, when he was prime minister, to give the Palestinians
80 percent of the West Bank and a suggestion of Minister in Prime
Minister's Office Haim Ramon, which is to annex 10 percent of the
West Bank, give the Palestinians 70 percent and leave 20 percent
under joint control for five to ten more years.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, Barak told Clinton that his position
was "closer to that of Peres," but that he did not envision giving
the Palestinians as much land as Peres had suggested.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Russia and Syria are expected to conclude a 500 million U.S.
dollars arms deal including advanced fighters and a sophisticated
air defense missile system, according to recent reports in the
Russian newspaper Vremya.
</P>
<P>
The deal is expected to take effect as early as this week and
includes 30 Sukhoi-27 air-superiority fighters and possibly the
very advanced long-range S-300 air defense missile system.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Syria is expected to receive another shipment of
Kornet and Metis advanced anti-tank guided missiles.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said Saturday that he sees no
reason why the last of the Lebanese hostages, Mustafa Dirani and
Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid, need to be put on trial to keep them in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
"From my reading of the High Court decision, there is no reason
to believe that the Supreme Court will order them to be released if
there is a petition to that effect," said Beilin. "The court
stressed the importance of the security threat factor in
determining whether administrative detention was acceptable or not.
</P>
<P>
Security officials and Israel's Supreme Court Wednesday ordered
the release of 13 of the 15 Lebanese hostages being held in
administrative detention in Israel as bargaining chips for the
freedom of captive Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli stocks did not escape the chill that ran through Wall
Street last week and there is concern that the losses in share
prices on Nasdaq will be echoed in trading Sunday on the Tel Aviv
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the technology heave Nasdaq index fell by 10 percent,
bring its losses for the week to 25 percent. The Dow Jones index
also registered a significant decline, retreating 5.7 percent to a
level of 10,305.8 points. The Dow Jones lost a total of 7.3 percent
over the last week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli stocks continued on a downward trend
throughout the week, including Friday. This negative slide included
several large companies as well as smaller firms.

DHAKA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The indefinite strike by truck
drivers and workers of Bangladesh entered its fourth consecutive
day on Sunday, paralyzing the transportation of goods across the
country.
</P>
<P>
The road communication across the country will be further
disrupted from Monday when workers of all modes of transports will
go on strike for an indefinite period in support of the truck
drivers and workers.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Inter-District Truck Drivers Union enforced the
indefinite strike from Thursday across the country to press home
their three-point demand including release of its president and
other arrested leaders and workers.
</P>
<P>
Later, the Federation of Truck Workers also joined the strike
called by the Inter-District Truck Drivers Union.
</P>
<P>
The police recently arrested the President of the Union
Kafiluddin on charge of collecting tolls illegally from trucks and
other modes of transports.
</P>
<P>
The government had already launched a drive against illegal
toll takers. As part of the drive, the Ministry of Home Affairs
ordered demolition of illegal toll structures across the country.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Road Transport Workers Federation will put their
vehicles off the roads all over the country from Monday for an
indefinite period of protest against the comment of a police chief.
</P>
<P>
Inspector General of Police (IGP) reportedly told local
newspaper on Wednesday that the government would no longer abide
by the compromise agreement that barred police from filing case
against any "killer" driver under Article 302 of the country's
Traffic Law.
</P>
<P>
The police used to file case against a "killer" driver under
Article 304 of the law that provides for a maximum punishment of
only three years in prison. Under the Article 302, the maximum
punishment is death sentence.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Road Transport Workers Federation protested the
statement of the IGP, saying that no drivers would drive vehicles
with "hanging rope around their necks."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bangladesh Truck Drivers Union opposed the strike
for an indefinite period. Executive President Nur Mohammad of the
union in a statement to the press on Friday called upon the
transport workers to ignore the strike and put their vehicles on
the road.
</P>
<P>
He termed the strike as illogical because it would not
safeguard the interests of the drivers as a whole. He said that
the strike has been called "to protect the interests of vested
quarters."

<HEADLINE> British Experts to Help Probe Kanungu Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Forensic experts and pathologists
from the British Metropolitan Police, the Scotland Yard, are
expected to arrive in Uganda soon to help probe the Kanungu
incident in which hundreds of people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Asuman Mugenyi told Xinhua in a telephone
interview on Sunday that Uganda needed help from foreign countries
especially in the field of forensic experts as far as the Kanungu
massacre is concerned.
</P>
<P>
He said the whole thing was beyond the capacity of Ugandan
police and experts from other foreign countries were also invited
to come in and take over the investigation work.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not reveal to which countries the Ugandan
police had sent invitation letters.
</P>
<P>
The foreign experts were also expected to study the mutilated
bodies exhumed from mass graves after the March 17 Kanungu
incident.
</P>
<P>
On March 17, over 530 people were burnt to death in a church
fire in Kanungu in southwestern Uganda by leaders of a cult
Movement for the Restoration of Ten Commandments of God. Hundreds
of bodies were later exhumed from at least five mass graves on
properties belonging to cult leaders.
</P>
<P>
Investigation and postmortem work was relatively slow due to
lack of advanced equipment and technology.

<HEADLINE> No Going Back on Farms: Zimbabwean War Veterans' Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Chenjerai Hunzvi, leader of
Zimbabwean war veterans, Saturday made the vows that the
occupation of white-owned commercial farms will continue, The
Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
The veterans of the country's liberation struggle have invaded
more than 1,000 farms countrywide since February this year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing thousands of war veterans in Harare Saturday, Hunzvi
said, "I (have) no power to withdraw the war veterans from their
motherland. Even if I had power, it would be against my
conscience. I didn't send them there and I cannot and I will not
withdraw them."
</P>
<P>
Hunzvi accused the British government of interfering in
Zimbabwe's domestic affairs and urged war veterans to gather at
the Harare International Airport Sunday to welcome President
Robert Mugabe home from the Group of 77 economic summit in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
On April 7, Mugabe praised war veterans for invading
white-owned commercial farms, saying they were keeping the
liberation spirit alive.
</P>
<P>
Acting President Joseph Msika however ordered all the war
veterans and land hungry communal people to withdraw from the
farms to clear the way for an orderly resettlement on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was no longer necessary for the former freedom
fighters to continue occupying the farms, because Parliament has
passed an Amendment Bill of the Constitution, which empowers the
government to acquire land from white farmers without
compensation.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the High Court ordered the state and the
police to move in and assist in the eviction of war veterans and
communal people on the occupied farms.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Outlines New Social Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government would
spend 240 million Australian dollars (148.8 million U.S. dollars)
to improve access to child-care and to bolster family support
services as part of its new focus on social reform.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard Sunday announced the four-year
program in his keynote address to the ruling Liberal Party
national convention in Melbourne in southeast Australia.
</P>
<P>
Howard said while economic and taxation reform was crucial for
Australia, the changes must lead to a better social outcome for
Australians.
</P>
<P>
He said that under the Stronger Families Strategy, more money
would be spent to provide support for parents who needed help or
advice to raise children.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of isolating them, we should be reaching out to those
people who are crying out for help," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
He said that of the 240 million Australian dollars, 70 million
Australian dollars (43.4 million U.S. dollar) would be allocated
over four years to expand access to child-care services to people
who worked on shifts and in remote areas.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, child-care workers would come to the home and
possibly stay overnight, saving parents the need to disrupt a
child's routine by taking him or her to a child-care center.
</P>
<P>
"We should provide the option for the care to go to the home,
not the reverse," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
He said 4 million Australian dollars (2.48 million U.S. dollars)
would be spent on helping young people in isolated areas.
</P>
<P>
The money would fund 10,000 cadetships for young people in
isolated areas to help them take part in a wider range of
activities.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Howard also said the party faced significant
challenges and warned MPs and senators not to underestimate Labor'
s desire to win back power at the next election, due in late 2001.
</P>
<P>
"Never underestimate your political opponent," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't underestimate the challenge that lies ahead of the
coalition as it heads toward the next election," he said.

<HEADLINE> First Hotline against Software Piracy Launched in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The first hotline against
software piracy was launched Saturday by Minister for Information
Technology Pramod Mahajan.
</P>
<P>
Installed by the National Association of Software and Service
Companies (NASSCOM) along with the Business Software Alliance, the
24 hour toll-free hotline would operate from Chennai.
</P>
<P>
Mahajan said though the piracy rate had come down in the
country from 89 percent in 1993 to 60 percent today, other
developed countries like the United States had a rate of 27
percent and in Singapore it was 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the NASSCOM, in the last financial year the
information technology industry is estimated to have lost about 9
billion rupees (209.3 million U.S. dollars) due to piracy in
addition to loss of jobs.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Rejects Proposal to Set Up Methamphetamine Factory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 16 (Xinhua) - Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
disagrees with the proposal of some academics for the state to set
up a factory to produce methamphetamine to fight traffickers of
this drug, the Thai News Agency (TNA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Narcotic Control Board Sorasit Sangprasert quoted
the premier as expressing the disagreement to the proposal of some
academics that the state-run production would reduce the prices of
the illicit drug to the level that was unattractive to traffickers
and help rehabilitate methamphetamine addicts.
</P>
<P>
"Other countries would otherwise be confused with the
government's policy to fight the drug and methamphetamine would be
freely available in Thailand," Sorasit said.
</P>
<P>
The authorities were taking a right path in narcotic
suppression by arresting traffickers and rehabilitating addicts,
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, communities would have to throw more efforts to help
the state in the fight, he added.

DHAKA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The government of Bangladesh has
outlined the National Budget of 358.8 billion taka (7,376 million
U.S.dollars) for the 2000-2001 fiscal year with a target of
revenue earning of 248.8 billion taka (4,976 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The rest 110 billion taka (2,200 million dollars) is expected
to be
financed from foreign aid and other domestic sources, the
Bangladesh Observer reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The outline of the next budget is indicated in the country's
memorandum, presented at the Bangladesh Development Forum Meeting
held in Paris on April 13-14.
</P>
<P>
According to the memorandum, the size of the Annual Development
Program (ADP) for the coming fiscal is likely to be 165 billion
taka (3,300 million dollars) which is 10 billion taka (200 million
dollars) higher than the current ADP figure.
</P>
<P>
The revenue expenditure for the 2000-2001 fiscal is estimated
at 193 billion taka (3,860 million dollars) as against the
targeted revenue earning of 248.8 billion taka (4,976 million
dollars), thus leaving a surplus of 55.8 billion taka (1,116
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The National Budget for the current 1999-2000 fiscal targets
revenue earning of 241.51 billion taka (4,830 million dollars) as
against the revenue expenditure of 178 billion taka (3,560 million
dollars), leaving a surplus of 63.51 billion taka (1,270 million
dollars). But the government so far could not achieve the target
of revenue earning, resulting in huge shortfall in revenue budget.
</P>
<P>
At the annual meeting of the Bangladesh Development Forum in
Paris, donors agreed to give the country the 1.8-2.2 billion U.S.
dollars in aid for 2000-2001 fiscal. But the donors cautioned
Bangladesh that if the pace of reform was not accelerated and
rampant corruption not dealt with properly, the aid package might
be delayed.

According to the Reserve Bank of India, the 0.06 jump in the

<HEADLINE> Interview: Nepali Ambassador to China Urges Economic Cooperation By Zhuang Meijie, Song Dejun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Nepalese Ambassador to the
People's Republic of China stressed here on Saturday the need to
add economic dimensions to the long-standing friendship between
Nepal and China.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Rajeshwar Acharya said that the
good relations existing between Nepal and China in the political
sector should be expanded to the areas of economic cooperation for
the mutual benefits of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the long history of friendship between the two close
neighbors which share the Himalayan mountains, Acharya said Nepal
and China have excellent relationship both in the past and at
present.
</P>
<P>
"I believe this cordiality and good neighborliness will
continue in the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We do not have any disputes or outstanding issues, therefore,
Nepal has been providing support to China on national and
international issues," said the 53-year-old ambassador, who was
assigned to China one-and-half years ago and is now on a one-month
holiday here.
</P>
<P>
However, looking at the nature of our good relationship in
political sector, economic cooperation is far from enough, Acharya
regretted.
</P>
<P>
"Time has come for us to look into the economic dimension of
our partnership and make good use of our friendship for economic
development between our two countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, the bilateral trade between Nepal
and China in 1999 stood at 215 million U.S. dollars, accounting
for less than three percent of Nepal's total foreign trade volume,
while Nepal-India trade occupies more than 60 percent in the same
year.
</P>
<P>
Acharya made a point of noting that to further develop economic
relations with China is the very policy of the Nepali new
government led by G.P. Koirala, who has put economic diplomacy at
the top of its foreign policy since he came into power last month.
</P>
<P>
"The new policy of the present Nepali government relating to
China is to let our good neighborliness and friendship be for the
mutual benefits of our two peoples and two countries," he
elaborated.
</P>
<P>
Talking on the prospect of economic cooperation between Nepal
and China, Acharya said "there are many areas where we can
cooperate," such as trade, investment, tourism, agriculture,
construction and transportation.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador drew a promising picture for Nepal-China joint
efforts in tapping the huge water resources in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
"We can achieve great benefits if we can work together for
harnessing the water resources, not only for generating
electricity, but also for multiple-use of water resources such as
irrigation, fishery, entertainment and so on," he said.
</P>
<P>
Acharya explained that the surplus power generated from water
can be exported to India, which is also in bad need of irrigation
water for its large areas of dry land.
</P>
<P>
As a mountainous country which has numerous rivers, Nepal
reserves a capacity of 83 million kilowatt hydro-power.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Nepal can target the six South Asian neighbors as
a huge market for export, Acharya believed there were great
potentialities for Nepal-China joint ventures in manufacturing,
food-processing and even in agriculture production.
</P>
<P>
"Why not make good use of this advantage and set up joint
ventures," Acharya appealed to Chinese investors.
</P>
<P>
As to the query whether there are any barriers between Nepal
and China for trade and investment, Acharya said the only problem
is the lack of communications between the people of the two
countries which are not well-linked by roads.
</P>
<P>
"What I am doing now is to build up a bridge between Nepal and
China and to let people know more about each other," said the
ambassador, who has travelled to many cities in China, including
ancient cities of Xi'an, Luoyang and Kaifeng, as well as modern
cities such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Shanghai, among
others.
</P>
<P>
During his visits to these cities, Acharya spared no pains to
pass the information about Nepal to Chinese officials and business
leaders in order to convince them of the great prospect of
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
As an economist who had studied the Nepalese economy for more
than 30 years, Acharya believes he is in a better position to
promote the economic relations between Nepal and China.
</P>
<P>
"To build the longest Nepal-China friendship for the future, I
am trying to advance the partnership in a larger scale in economic
areas," he said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Recognize Use of Traditional Chinese Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Public Health Ministry of
Thailand has approved a five-year plan to treat patients in
community hospitals with traditional Chinese medicine, the Bangkok
Post reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Khamron Na Lamphun, deputy health minister, was quoted as
saying that the use of Chinese medicine could be officially
adopted if found successful in the treatment of patients, even
though it was not officially recognized under current laws.
</P>
<P>
The Medical Registration Act allows the health minister to
approve the use of other methods of treatment which have not yet
been officially recognized.
</P>
<P>
Traditional Thai medicine is sometimes used to treat patients
even though Thailand only recognizes the use of modern medicine in
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The medical registration division of the health ministry has
been asked to consider issuing temporary two-year licenses to
practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, only those trained in the art of Chinese
medicine and having more than five years' experience may apply for
the registration, Khamron said.
</P>
<P>
He said the applicants, who would be required to be Thai
citizens or spouses of Thai citizens, would be evaluated by a
committee under a cooperative program between the Thai and Chinese
governments.

<HEADLINE> Developing Countries Express Concern at Industrial Nations' Trade Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Excessive increases in short-term interest rates in major
industrial countries may negatively affect global growth prospects
and the cost of credit for the developing countries," said a
communique issued at the end of the 63rd meeting of the Ministers
of the Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four (G-24) on
International Monetary Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The communique said progress must be accelerated on lowering
barriers to developing country exports, especially granting full
access to all exports from the least developed countries in order
to help sustain global growth prospects and enhance poverty
reduction efforts.
</P>
<P>
The G-24 ministers emphasized in the communique the need for a
well-sequenced and balanced approach toward the further
integration of developing countries, particularly the poorest,
into the global trading system.
</P>
<P>
They were of the view that the World Bank and the regional
development banks have an important role to play in capacity
building and infrastructure development to further and accelerate
that integration.
</P>
<P>
The preparation of Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) in
a participatory process is a demanding and time-consuming
undertaking for the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs), which
should not delay the provision of debt relief, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers expressed deep concern regarding the
insufficiency of contributions from donor countries for the HIPC
Trust Fund to finance the share of debt relief from the World Bank
and other multilaterals.
</P>
<P>
They have strong reservations regarding any significant
shortening of maturity for International Monetary Fund (IMF)
facilities that are provided in support of members experiencing
balance of payments disequilibrium of a structural character and
that could not be corrected in short order.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the G-24 member countries also expressed their
concern at proposals to reform the IMF and the World Bank,
particularly any changes that could make it more difficult for
them to obtain loans or have to pay them back faster.
</P>
<P>
"We find some of these proposals unacceptable and have serious
concerns about them," said German Suarez, chairman of the G-24, at
a press conference after the group's meeting. "But we support
efforts to reform" the IMF and the World Bank and "strengthen
cooperation between them."
</P>
<P>
Suarez referred to the so-called Meltzer Report, written by a
commission led by Carnegie Mellon University Professor Alan
Meltzer. The report recommended that the IMF should stop lending
to the world's poorest nations, many of which are African, and
leave development financing to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also rejected conclusions of a U.S. congressional
committee that the IMF should limit itself to short term lending
and the World Bank should halt loans to middle income countries.
</P>
<P>
The G-24 meets twice a year at the deputies and the ministerial
level and makes proposals to the Interim Committee of the Board of
Governors of the IMF and the Development Committee of the Board of
Governors of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
It consists of an important cross section of countries across
Africa, Asia and Latin America. Since its establishment in 1972,
the G-24 has become the primary institutional mechanism for the
coordination of developing country positions on monetary affairs.
</P>
<P>
The group comprises Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Cote
d'Ivoire, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guatemala, India, Iran,
Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, the
Republic of Congo, Sri Lanka, Syria, Trinidad-Tobago, Venezuela
and Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Nations Promise to Support Global Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Seven (G-7)
leading industrial nations Saturday promised to cooperate with
other countries to promote global prosperity.
</P>
<P>
In a communique released after a meeting of G-7 finance
ministers and central bank governors, the world's seven wealthiest
countries said they agreed on the continued importance of
directing both macroeconomic and structural policies "in all our
countries at this objective, with emphasis on taking full
advantage of the investment opportunities created by new
technologies to raise potential growth rates."
</P>
<P>
"We re-emphasized our commitment to maintain or create
conditions for strong, sustainable growth in each of our countries,
" the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers also pledged to keep pushing ahead with
reforms of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The communique said in the context of the changing global
financial landscape, in particular the increasing importance of
private global capital markets, it is appropriate for the
international community to continue to examine the role and
functioning of the international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
"We also agreed to continue our work to implement fully the
wide range of measures to strengthen the international financial
architecture endorsed at the Cologne summit last June, including
promoting appropriate private sector involvement," it noted.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministers tacitly acknowledged that the Highly
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative was not running well.
</P>
<P>
"We reaffirm the importance we attach to bringing countries
quickly to the point where they can benefit from debt relief," the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 agreed in Cologne to radically overhaul the existing
HIPC scheme which had failed to deliver any meaningful debt relief
to the world's 40-odd poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
The ministers welcomed the initiation of World Trade
Organization (WTO) negotiations in agriculture and services and
supported efforts to build a consensus for the early launch of a
new round of multilateral trade negotiations designed to bring
benefit to all countries, including the poorest.
</P>
<P>
They called on the IMF and the World Bank to work with the WTO
and other relevant institutions to improve the effectiveness of
trade-related technical assistance, and to more fully incorporate
policies promoting international trade and capacity building into
IMF programs and World Bank operations.
</P>
<P>
The group's communique did not specifically mention the huge
plunge in U.S. stock prices last week, but the officials stressed
an upbeat view of growth prospects for the global economy which
they said "continue to brighten."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after the G-7 meeting, U.S.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said despite the huge U.S.
stock sell-off, in which nearly 2 trillion U.S. dollars of wealth
was lost in a single week, "the momentum of the expansion is very
much in place. ... There will be fluctuations from quarter to
quarter, but our economy is strong."

<HEADLINE> S. Lankan Govt Rejects Rebel Demand On Troops Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
rejected a "demand" by Tamil rebels for troops withdrawals in
northern Jaffna Peninsula for peace talks, according to a
statement from the Foreign Ministry here.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry, in a statement issued Saturday evening, said top
rebel official Anton Balasingham in a media interview in London,
said government troops withdrawal could take place only if a
permanent political solution is reached.
</P>
<P>
Balasingham, the Tamil rebel theoretician, told the Tamil "
Guardian" magazine in London last month that the troops should
remove "a complex set of repressive conditions....on the Tamil
people."
</P>
<P>
Balasingham, who is now reportedly based in the United Kingdom
and travels the continent on rebel propaganda work, also wanted a
program of disengagement, a cease-fire and reallocation of
government troops back to their barracks.
</P>
<P>
The statement said "the government rejected Balasingham's
suggestion that repressive conditions are being imposed on the
Tamil people."
</P>
<P>
The government wishes to reiterate that the prevailing security
measures could not be dismantled, as long as the Tamil rebels
continue on its path of violence and destruction, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the government troops operating in predominantly
Tamil areas, particularly Jaffna peninsula, have shown a high
degree of professionalism in protecting the Tamil people despite
grave provocation by the rebels, while at the same time
safeguarding the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The Jaffna peninsula was once the stronghold of the Tamil
rebels who have been fighting a war for a separate Tamil state in
the north and east of the country since 1983. The peninsula was
recaptured by the government troops in may 1996.

<HEADLINE> Brazil, Mexico to Discuss Agreement on Customs Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Brazil and Mexico are to discuss
a bilateral customs tariffs agreement for agricultural and
industrial products Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is expected to propose that the tariffs on soybean cake
and oil, now at 18 percent and 10 percent respectively between the
two countries, be reduced to zero.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the Brazilian Agriculture Ministry expected to
double the soybean cake export and increase the sales of soybean
oil if an agreement is struck with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Brazil exported 100,000 tons of soybean cake, while
the sales of soybean oil were practically zero, according to the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's another major export is orange juice, for which the
tariff imposed by Mexico is 23 percent, the ministry's agriculture
policy secretary Benedito Rosa de Espiritu Santo said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The most sensitive products for the negotiation are raw hides,
footwear, lumber, paper and cellulose, he said.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is reluctant to import electronics, chemicals and
petrochemicals from Mexico for fear that U.S. industries in Mexico
might inundate the Brazilian market with their products, according
to the secretary.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Rich Countries to Open Markets to Poor Ones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Opening up the developed
countries' markets to the developing countries is a prerequisite
for the healthy and sustainable development of global trade
liberalization, a Chinese central bank official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"If rich countries do not open their markets to the poor
countries, it will be groundless to discuss the contribution of
international trade to the development and poverty reduction,"
said Xiao Gang, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, at
the 63rd meeting of the Ministers of the Intergovernmental Group
of Twenty-Four (G-24) on International Monetary Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the developed and developing countries has
increased, Xiao said, adding that this trend must be reversed,
otherwise it will "bring serious consequences for the development
of world peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in the process of reforming the
international financial system, the interests and needs of the
developing countries deserve sufficient respect and reflection. As
a cooperative organization, he said, the work of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) should be based on trust with member
governments and respect for members' sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"Requiring members to follow standards and codes is an
important means of strengthening IMF surveillance. However, the
formulation of relevant international standards and codes should
not be conducted without the broad participation of the developing
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the direction of the IMF's future development,
Xiao said China supports making appropriate adjustments in line
with changing conditions. "We believe that the IMF should stick to
its original mandate -- to safeguard the stability of member
countries' macro-economies and the international currency system,
to play a role as lender of last resort, and to meet members'
demands in their balance of payments adjustments," he said.
</P>
<P>
Xiao expressed the hope that the IMF and the World Bank will
focus their research on the challenges and opportunities brought
about by the "new economy" for developing countries in the area of
international trade.
</P>
<P>
The G-24 meets twice a year at the deputies and the ministerial
level and makes proposals to the Interim Committee of the Board of
Governors of the IMF and the Development Committee of the Board of
Governors of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The group, which has become the primary institutional mechanism
for coordinating positions of developing countries on monetary
affairs since its establishment in 1972,  consists of an
important cross section of countries across Africa, Asia and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
It comprises Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Cote
d'Ivoire, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guatemala, India, Iran,
Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, the
Republic of Congo, Sri Lanka, Syria, Trinidad-Tobago, Venezuela
and Yugoslavia. China is one of the observers of the G-24.

<HEADLINE> US-based Multinational Brings In New Concept to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua)-- With information technologies
rapidly developing in China. NCR, a US-based multinational, is
trying to introduce its new "relationship technologies" concept to
the country.
</P>
<P>
"Relationship technologies" are critical for businesses in the
networked economy as relationships will soon be the only true
differentiator that companies have," Lars Nyberg, chairman of NCR,
was quoted as saying in today's China Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
"If a company has a fantastic product, its competitors can copy
it quickly. But no competitor can copy knowledge about a company's
customers," he explained.
</P>
<P>
So, Nyberg said, relationship technologies should help
businesses transform data gathered into a knowledge and
understanding about customers and hence build loyal relationships
with them.
</P>
<P>
China's banks, telecommunications firms and airlines will have
certain advantages over their foreign competitors if they start to
build such relationship with their customers and prepare for
competition expected after China joins the World Trade
Organization (WTO), he said.
</P>
<P>
NCR, which sells and manufactures ATMs in China, entered the
market 14 years ago.

<HEADLINE> China to Liquidate State Assets for Pension Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China could raise billions of
yuan by liquidating some State assets to finance its huge
shortfall in pension funding, according to today's China Daily
Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
The English-language weekly quoted a government source as
warning that failure to do so could threaten the country's pension
system.
</P>
<P>
A variety of measures could be employed, including redeeming
State-held shares in listed companies and charging for the
previously free use of land, to raise funds to support a sounder
pension system, the paper said citing a report by the State
Council Office for Economic Restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government needs at least 1.8 trillion yuan ( about
217 billion US dollars), which was the most optimistic scenario,
to repay debts owned under the old pension system.
</P>
<P>
China implemented a new pension system three years ago that
established individual pension accounts for active workers in
State enterprises, to be contributed monthly by both workers and
employers. But that left a gaping need for pension funds for
workers retired or hired before 1997 who expect equal treatment.
</P>
<P>
A huge pension deficit has already resulted in siphoning as
much as 100 billion yuan (about 12 billion US dollars) from
individual pension accounts to balance the pension system's budget
in 1999, statistics from the Ministry of Labor and Social Security
indicated.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the sale of shares held by the State in
listed companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets alone
could raise as much as 220 billion yuan (about 26.5 billion US
dollars).

<P>
JAKARTA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- At least three persons were
killed and two others injured in a minor communal clash in
Halmahera island in North Maluku, Indonesia, on Saturday.

The renewed conflict happened in the northern part of Galela
sub-district, about 2,600 kilometers northeast of Jakarta,
according to the Antara News Agency Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Rioters, who reportedly used a small boat to the northern
seashore of Galela sub-district in the evening, had moved

island.
</P>
<P>
The three fatalities in the unrest had reportedly been killed

of the fighting were not easily accessible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in two villages in Jailolo sub-district in the
northern part of Halmahera, people's homes continued to be the
target of arson.
</P>
<P>
"The unrest in the two villages erupted last week when an
identified mass torched 22 houses and one house of worship in
Tauro Besar village and one house in Tauro Kecil village," Capt.
Afson Sirat, field operations officer at the North Maluku Military
Command was quoted by Antara as saying.
</P>
<P>
But on the whole, he said, there was no major security
disturbance in the North Maluku province and the local
administrations were meeting no hindrance in implementing their
administrative, development and social programs.
</P>
<P>
The situation in general remains good on the islands in the
province and all activities are taking place unperturbed, he added.
</P>
<P>
Maluku has witnessed a year long ethnic bloodshed between
Christian and Muslim, which has claimed more than 1,300 civilians.
The security situation in the area had gradually returned to
normal this year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Set up Special Team to Screen Soccer Players for Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Soccer
Association of Indonesia (PSSI) Agum Gumelar said he would set up
a special team to monitor soccer players to prevent them from
using illegal drugs, according to the Jakarta Post Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Agum's remark came after reports that the late Eri Irianto, a
top player from Persebaya club in Surabaya, did not die of heart
failure after his last match earlier this month as announced by
the club physician.
</P>
<P>
Persebaya's manager Karwoto was quoted by local media Friday as
saying that Eri had no history of heart problems in his medical
report. Karwoto refused to comment on whether Eri had taken
illegal drugs that might have caused his death.
</P>
<P>
Agum said that the special team would be headed by Sonny Tobing,
who chaired PSSI's health commission.
</P>
<P>
"We want to prevent any similar occurrences from happening in
the future. The team will investigate and examine whether our
soccer players are taking illegal drugs or banned substances. If
we find any player who do so, we will try to settle the matter and
we won't kill his career in sports," Agum said.
</P>
<P>
Eri was reportedly suffering breathing difficulty after he
crashed with an unidentified player from PSIM Yogyakarta on April
2 in Bank Mandiri national soccer league action in Surabaya.
</P>
<P>
He was rushed to the emergency ward of Dr. Sutomo Hospital was
pronounced dead early on Monday. He was diagnosed as suffering
from a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
Upon hearing the information, PSSI secretary general Tri
Goestono immediately flew to Surabaya to express condolence and to
probe the cause of Eri's death. Tri remained tightlipped over the
probe's result.
</P>
<P>
Agum said the team would also investigate Eri's case and
another case that happened to Kuncoro, a player from PSM Makassar
in South Sulawesi who reportedly lost consciousness when his team
played Petro Kimia Gresik earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out the possibility that the two might have
taken illegal drugs.

BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China's agricultural and forestry
businesses are authorized to accept foreign cooperative partners,
China Daily Business Weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission (SDPC) and the State
Economic and Trade Commission are jointly working on a directory,
which will grant joint venture projects in the sectors with
preferential tax incentives, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaoqiang, director of the Foreign Fund Utilization
Department under SDPC, was quoted as saying that the directory
allows foreign-invested agricultural projects in West China to
enjoy reduced import tariffs, income taxes and financial levies
for land use.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-invested companies in East China, especially in the
coastal areas, are now encouraged to invest in the west to expand
their businesses, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
China previously banned foreign-funded firms in East China from
handling reinvestments in the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
According to the new directory, foreign-funded agricultural
projects that meet the State's current industrial guidelines for
foreign investment will have a 15-percent tax cut from their
income taxes in addition to the preferential tax treatment now
given to the country's foreign-funded joint ventures for their
initial three years of operation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Overseas diesel engine makers are
casting their eyes on China's huge market potential although such
production is highly restricted in China, China Daily Business
Weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
China needs more engines to provide power for the rapid growth
in its transportation, construction and automotive sectors.
</P>
<P>
But outdated diesel engines used in the past contributed to the
country's air pollution problems and irritated people in traffic.
</P>
<P>
To overcome the diesel engine's bad image in China and to
promote modern engines as part of a solution, seven foreign diesel
and automobile component producers inaugurated a "green diesel
initiative" in China about a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The companies include Cummins, DaimlerChrysler, Caterpillar,
Isuzu, Bosch, Dana and Volvo Trunk.
</P>
<P>
The companies advocate the adoption and strict equal
enforcement of emissions standards based on an engine's
performance in China.
</P>
<P>
As part of the initiative, the companies will host technical
seminars in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Guangzhou, to
disseminate information about modern diesels and their advantages
in emissions reduction.

<HEADLINE> Sina Soars with NASDAQ Listing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It said that Sina rose almost 22 percent on its first trading
day on a stock market that was recently shaken by a deep loss.
</P>
<P>
"The reception of Sina.com will add some motivation to other
Chinese Internet players though the initial price did not meet
investors' expectations," said Hugo Shong, vice-chairman of IDG
Technology Venture Investment.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Sina's timing was less than perfect because of
the high-profile reaction to the Microsoft anti-trust case
decision.
</P>
<P>
Given the active listing preparations made by other leading
Chinese Internet operators, analysts warned they should take a
prudent attitude towards going public.
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ stock index slipped from over 5,000 in March to 3,
676 last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, a US investment bank analyst said the NASDAQ still has
a compelling demand for China-concept Internet candidates because
of their strong market potential and the limited amount of similar
Chinese listings.
</P>
<P>
China's oil company that was listed on the New York Stock
Market has too provided a vivid and successful example. Even
though some people consider the PetroChina's current performance
on securities markets is far from what was originally expected,
the listing should be regarded as an overwhelming triumph.
PetroChina was spun off from its parent firm, the China National
Petroleum Corp, a wholly State oil giant.
</P>
<P>
The listing has helped PetroChina diversify its shareholdings,
to break a State monopoly in such a way as to open the way for
other investors.

</P>
<P>
-- China's leading industrial and commercial city Shanghai

revenue in the first quarter of this year, an increase of 46.78
percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Shanghai municipal taxation authorities
attributed the increase to the vigorous stock market, bustling
industrial and commercial markets, and the sustainable development
of the local economy.
</P>
<P>
-- Statistics from the Zhejiang Provincial Statistical Bureau
show that the province's state-owned and non-state industrial
enterprises earned 31.2 billion yuan (about 3.75 billion dollars)

</P>
<P>
Total industrial sales earned 126.47 billion yuan (about 15.23
billion US dollars), an increase of 24.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Rapid increase in exports, structural adjustment and production
quota fixing as well as efforts to reduce the overstock products
are cited as the major factors leading to the increase.

<HEADLINE> Paper Sector Offers Golden Investment Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China's paper sector is in dire
need of investment to satisfy an expected increasing demand for
paper products within the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
With the country's rapid economic growth, domestic demand for
paper products will surge to 80 million tons in 2015, said Cao
Pufang, vice president of China Paper Association.
</P>
<P>
The sector will require an investment of about 490 billion yuan
(about 59 billion US dollars) to enhance domestic output to meet
the demand, said Cao.
</P>
<P>
But the sector is in short of investment funding, which is the
largest bottleneck to the paper output increase, he said.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the sector has averaged about 10 billion yuan (
about 1.2 billion US dollars) per year in recent years, according
to China Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
The investment shortage provides a golden opportunity for
foreign paper-making companies to expand their presence in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Although the country encourages foreign investment in the
sector, some special products such as glassine, banknote paper and
stamp paper, are still inaccessible to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
A mounting shortage of paper products especially for printing
and packaging looms in the country, according to the association.

<HEADLINE> Man United Move Closer to Premier League Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Manchester
United took another big step towards English premier league title
with a 4-0 win over Sunderland on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Man United, who started the day effectively needing seven
points for the crown, stretched their lead over second-played
Liverpool to 14 points with just five games to play.
</P>
<P>
Ole Gunnar Solksjaer scored two goals for the winners in the
day's match. He pounced on a poor backpass to score in the second
minute and then showed great composure to put away his second in
the 51st minute, dancing around a defender and firing in with his
left foot.
</P>
<P>
Nicky Butt smashed in a fierce shot from the right-hand side of
the box for the third in the 66th minute and Henning Berg added a
fourth in the 70th as Sunderland went to pieces in the second half.
</P>
<P>
United have now broken the premier league's goalscoring record
with 84 from 33 games.
</P>
<P>
The result was a huge psychological boost for United before the
second leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Real
Madrid at Old Trafford on Wednesday. The first leg ended goalless.
</P>
<P>
The European Cup holders have 76 points and, with their
superior goal difference, effectively need 80 to be champions --
the maximum number of points that Liverpool can pick up in their
last six games. They play Wimbledon on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Third-placed Leeds also take on Arsenal on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Fourth-placed Chelsea's hopes of staying in the battle for the
second direct spot in the Champions League were hit by a 1-0
defeat at relegation-theatened Sheffield Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea, who take on Barcelona away in their Champions League
quarter-final second leg on Tuesday after winning the first leg 3-
1, lost to a 51st minute penalty by Wim Jonk.

the relegation after suffering double blows on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The team lost to Kaiserslautern 0-1 and faced a possible two-

The penalty was imposed after the 1980 UEFA Cup winners were
called before the DFB licensing committee to explain their
finances, which include arrears of $6.8 million.
</P>

Frankfurt will be docked two points at the end of the season
and risk expulsion from the first division if they stay too much

Bayern Munich lost to its crosstown rivals 1860 Munich in the
Olympia Stadium. 1860's Martin Max put his team ahead 1-0 in the

equalized with a freekick. Martin Max has scored 16 goals this
season.

<P>
Jens Jeremies scored an own goal in the 40th minute, handing
1860 the victory.

got the only goal in the 82nd minute, but one minute later he was
sent off with two yellow cards.

afternoon. Dortmund, led by new head coach Udo Lattek could not
yet win a victory.

"We must reciprocate, and that is why my first visit to Western
Europe is to Britain," Russian news agency Interfax quoted Putin
as saying in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Blair, who met Putin last month before his election at a high-
profile encounter in St Petersburg, made clear that he intended to
take the Russian leader to task over alleged human rights excesses
in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Putin, who flew in from the former Soviet state of Belarus,is
due to leave Britain late on Monday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Company Developing Gene-altered Salmon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Massachusetts-based AF Protein, which is carrying out its
research on Prince Edward Island, expects these new super-fish to
be cleared for consumer consumption within a year.
</P>
<P>
If given the green light, these fish would be the first
genetically modified (GM) animal to hit the market. The technology
could drastically change the way fish are farmed since the
technique cuts the cost of raising certain species such as salmon
and trout in half.
</P>
<P>
To get the Atlantic salmon to grow at such great speed, the
company inserted into the fish a gene sequence for growth hormones
from the Chinook salmon and genes that activate those hormones.
</P>
<P>
As a result, instead of producing growth hormone mostly in the
summer months, the genetically modified Atlantic salmon will
produce it year round.
</P>
<P>
But GM opponents are worried that some of the salmon could get
out, mix with non-GM fish and consequently taint the gene pool.
</P>
<P>
For its part, AF Protein maintains that its genetically
modified salmon are all tested to be sterile and pose no threat of
contamination to the wider salmon population.
</P>
<P>
Genetically modified food remains a hotly debated issue among
consumers, activists and environmentalists. Once the new Atlantic
salmon gets ready to hit supermarket shelves, the debate will only
heat up more.

<HEADLINE> Britain Demands Zimbabwe to Prevent Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Sunday summoned
Zimbabwe's High Commissioner in London, demanding that Zimbabwe
President Robert Mugabe prevent further killings and violence in
the southern African state.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that peace and stability are achieved quickly
and the rule of law upheld," Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Hain said he also told Zimbabwe's High Commissioner in London,
Simbarashe Mumbengegwi, that Britain was "gravely concerned" by
recent events in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"It is also important for leadership to be given from the very
top of government to prevent further lawlessness and violence,"
Hain said, signalling that Britain held Mugabe responsible for the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Following the summons, Mumbengegwi said he regretted the farmer
's murder.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook urged African
nations to pressure President Mugabe to end a black invasion of
white farmlands and prevent further bloodshed in the former
British colony.
</P>
<P>
Cook told reporters during a visit to India that Mugabe was
overseeing "the destruction of his own country".
</P>
<P>
"The situation is very grave. I'm worried it will get worse
unless there is a return to respect for the rule of law in
Zimbabwe," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who has been in power for 20 years since Britain's
last African colony won independence, has said the occupations are
a response to a historic injustice which left a few thousand white
farmers in control of the country's best land.

<HEADLINE> China Calls For Establishment of Fair World Trade, Economic System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A fair foreign trade and world
economic system should be established to ensure that all countries
benefit equally from globalization, a Chinese central banker said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Not only should the liberalization of commodity trade and
capital transactions be promoted and pursued, but also the free
movement of labor and the transfer of technology," said Xiao Gang,
deputy governor of the People's Bank of China and alternate
governor of the Fund for China, at a meeting of the International
Monetary and Financial Committee of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Xiao urged the advanced countries to strengthen their
macroeconomic coordination, maintain a reasonable stability of
exchange rates among the major currencies, increase the transfer
of funds and technology to the developing countries, especially to
the poorest ones, and open their markets to the latter.
</P>
<P>
On the IMF's role in the global economy, he said the Fund
should establish a relatively clear-cut division of labor and
responsibility with the World Bank, the Bank of International
Settlements (BIS), and other international institutions so that
overlapped functions can be avoided and resources better utilized.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, Xiao said, should focus on economic development
and poverty reduction. "Such an arrangement with unambiguously
defined mandates and subsequent specialization and cooperation
among these institutions will undoubtedly improve their efficiency
and allow them to actively play their respective roles."
</P>
<P>
China opposes any attempt to raise the interest rate for IMF
facilities and believes that the terms and interest rate of the
Fund facilities should not be made a scapegoat for the failure of
Fund programs, which largely result from their unrealistic
conditionalities, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, most of the poor countries have no access to the
international capital markets and emerging economies also have
difficulty in accessing the capital markets," Xiao said, adding
that IMF arrangements should ensure those members' access to Fund
resources and the role of the Fund in resolving its members'
balance of payment difficulties and in preventing and rescuing
financial crisis-affected economies should not be undermined.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Fund surveillance, Xiao said the IMF should focus
its attention on developing standards in its core areas such as
macroeconomic policy and balance of payments and improving
surveillance on their implementation.

<HEADLINE> Zoologists Urge Creation of DNA Banks for Endangered Species </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We urge that a coordinated worldwide attempt be made to store,
for every endangered species, samples of DNA, DNA libraries, or
frozen cells or tissues that could readily yield DNA," wrote the
group in the latest issue of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
"Our proposal is first to establish a means of collecting
information on DNA banking efforts for endangered species of
animals and, second, to encourage efforts to bank documented DNA
specimens for the future."
</P>
<P>
The group, led by Oliver Ryder from the Zoological Society of
San Diego, points out that other species have already benefited
from genetic information. As part of the effort to assess the
problem of declining numbers of black rhinos in Africa, for
instance, scientists used extensive analyses of mitochondrial DNA
diversity to distinguish the Southern black rhino populations from
the Eastern black rhinos.
</P>
<P>
But in addition to helping species living now, the information
could also be used to "reconstruct what the organism was like" in
the future if or when they become extinct.
</P>
<P>
The team says that although a global effort to store the DNA of
every endangered animal species - some 5,200 species - would be
costly, it would be technically easy. Any tissue samples can be
stored at minors 70 degrees Celsius or in liquid nitrogen. And
purified DNA can be preserved for hundreds to thousands of years
at room temperature, provided it is kept dry.
