<HEADLINE> Malawian Minister on Regional Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The globalisation of the world
economy has demonstrated to the southern African countries the need
to speed up regional integration and survive in a highly competitive
environment, Malawian Minister of Transport Harry Thompson said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing delegates at the Beira Corridor development conference
in Harare, Tompson said it was now evident that no single country
could ''do it alone'' in the globalised world market.
</P>
<P>
He said competition was fierce and to be competitive, countries
had to make timeous delivery of their goods.
</P>
<P>
''The concept of having a development corridor is a welcome move
for us in Malawi. This will spread development in our country and
also increase cross-border trade and investment.''
</P>
<P>
The Beira Corridor is a railway and road network running
between the Zimbabwean eastern border town of Mutare and the
Mozambican port city of Beira.
</P>
<P>
''The Malawian government has supported and will continue to
support Mozambique in rehabilitating the remaining kilometres near
Malawi,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Malawi government supported the Beira corridor
development conference initiative and believed it would mutually
benefit the peoples of the countries involved and also the entire
region. enditem

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Release 200 Million Dlrs to Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is likely to
release an additional tranche of 200 million US dollars to
Pakistan for balance of payment support next month above its
annual lending program.
</P>
<P>
"Its release in a single tranche would be an exception to the
previous practice, when such disbursement was used to be made in
two to three tranches in as many years," sources from Pakistan's
Finance Minister said.
</P>
<P>
The release of fund would be made on the fast disbursement
basis, reflecting confidence of the International donor agencies
over the fiscal and monetary reforms and its implementation in
Pakistan, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's annual lending program to Pakistan involves
about 650 million dollars and the release of fund amounting to
around 200 million dollars would be in addition to that.
</P>
<P>
Senior Pakistani officials held extensive talks with the
representatives of the World Bank in Islamabad recently on
boosting the country's banking and financial sector.
</P>
<P>
"These would now be finalized in Washington next week," sources
said. "The cabinet has already approved these reform measures to
be discussed with the donor agency."
</P>
<P>
Advisor to the Prime Minister on Finance and Economic Affairs
Shahid Burki is leading a high-level Pakistani delegation for
talks with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in
Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
The sources also denied that the reform measures were being
taken under the pressure from the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainians Cool Over Government Plan to Sell Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 3 (Xinhua) -- "I just cannot afford to pay the
rent", said Ulia, a 22-year-old Ukrainian woman. "How can I afford
to buy an apartment ?" she asked despairingly.
</P>
<P>
Ulia hasn't been paid for a year. Her husband is out of a job
and she owes the government 400 U.S. dollars in rent. Not
surprisingly she is cool to new plans by the government to ease the
country's housing crisis by giving Ukrainians loans or subsidies
to buy their own homes.
</P>
<P>
The government aims to set up a special organization to raise
funds to provide these loans or subsidies to help people buy their
own homes.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has also agreed to provide loans to three
Ukrainian cities for residential construction. The houses will be
sold to private buyers.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes these schemes will go some way to easing
the country's acute housing shortage and form part of a program
to transfer the state-owned property industry into a private
market-led industry.
</P>
<P>
Some five million households are living in dormitories and
2.5 million families and single people are queuing up for
a roof over their heads.
</P>
<P>
But with the country facing an economic crisis as it undergoes
transition from a centrally planned to a market economy, the
cash-strapped government has been powerless to help.
</P>
<P>
As national and company funds are short, Ukraine's residential
construction has shrunk by 200 percent in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has only built 7.5 million square meters of residential
houses this year, compared with 8.3 million square meters last
year, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Under the old centrally planned economy Ukrainians used to get
an apartment from the government and pay a small rent. But as the
country moved to a market economy and experienced the traumas of
the transition, the housing market is in chaos.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the 51,748,000 Ukrainians have not paid
their rent, complaining of wage delays and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Official unemployment in Ukraine remains very low, under one
percent. But the collapse of the Soviet command economy has left
many people technically jobless because their factories or coal
mines sit idle.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's government has pledged to pay the 1.8 billion
U.S. dollars in back wages it is estimated to owe state
workers. But it has been slow to come up with the funds.

<HEADLINE> Good Transport System Urged in SADC Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Regional Road Freight
Association (RRFA) today said good transport systems are necessary
for the socio-economic development of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the two-day Beira Development Corridor (bdc)
Conference being held in harare, RRFA Chairman Shadreck Matsimbe said
there was need for sound transport infrastructure in the region to
ensurfe the smooth flow of both rail and road traffic.
</P>
<P>
Already, he said, motorised road transport within the region moved
close to 80 percent of people and goods because of its flexibility.
</P>
<P>
He said the Beira Corridor was a convinient route as it was the
shortest route to the sea for most of southern Africa's land-locked
countries.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, certain portions of the region's roads are in
good, some in poor and others in a worse state, and it is important
to address these issues if we are to develop the region.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction with the improvement of the
security system in Mozambique in the past three years. enditem

MOSCOW, December 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 3,000 civil servants
in Kirghizia are to be sacked and the number of government
ministries slashed by almost a third from 22 to 16 as part of a
government austerity and efficiency drive, reports reaching here

</P>
<P>
According to decrees signed by Akayev, the ministries of
economics, transport, water resources and culture will be merged

<HEADLINE> Leading Economic Indicators Rose 0.1 Percent in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The composite index of leading
indicators, a main gauge of business cycle of the U.S., increased
0.1 percent in October to 103.6, the Conference Board reported
today.
</P>
<P>
This is the highest point ever since the index was initialized.
The index stood at 100 in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The New York based research group said that the leading
economic index increased 0.2 percent in September and 0.1 percent
in August. Over the six months from April to October, the index
rose 1.3 percent. During this period, eight of the 11 leading
economic indicators advanced.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board's calculations show that six of the 11
leading economic indicators rose in October. The most significant
increases ranged from stock prices to manufacturers' new orders of
consumer goods and materials. The most significant negative
contributor to the composite leading index in October is average
factory workweek.
</P>
<P>
Starting from December 30, the Conference Board will use new
revised factors for computing the indexes.

<HEADLINE> Most Differences Resolved on EU Monetary Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) Finance
Ministers on Monday resolved most of their differences over a
stability pact to require low budget deficits after monetary
union, local media reported here today.
</P>
<P>
All 15 EU members have accepted in principle a pact under which
fines would be imposed on states that surpass the single-currency
deficit maximum of three percent of their GDP.
</P>
<P>
But there is still disagreement over how and when fines will be
applied and the definition of "exceptional and temporary" economic
circumstances that would allow a country's budget deficit to
exceed this limit.
</P>
<P>
The stability pact is the final major technical building block
to monetary union. EU leaders have been aiming for an accord
to sustain the momentum toward a single currency when they meet in
Dublin later this month.
</P>
<P>
Officials said progress had been made on several parts of the
pact, including the imposition of fines on countries which report an
excessive budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
The unresolved issue at this ministerial meeting centered on
Germany's demands to severely limit the circumstances in
which countries would be allowed to run an excessive budget
deficit.
</P>
<P>
Germany wants a strict numerical definition of such
circumstances. It wants the magnitude of such an extraordinary
decline in growth to be specified at two percent, but other
countries have said the figure is too rigid.
</P>
<P>
The ministers have agreed to meet again in Dublin of Ireland on
December 12 to make a last-ditch effort for preparation of an
agreement which could be ratified by EU leaders at a summit
meeting that begins the following day.

MOSCOW, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian coal miners downed
tools today in an indefinite strike over demands for months of unpaid
wages, a miners union leader said.
</P>
<P>
Vitaly Budko, chairman of the Russian Coalminers' Union, told
reporters here that about 400,000 miners, from 154 out of

In addition to back wages of 1.5 trillion rubles (270 million

government, which has failed to "ensure the timely payment of
wages," said Budko.

He revealed that he had been invited to attend a Cabinet meeting

<HEADLINE> US New Home Sales Down Sharply in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- New home sales in the U.S.
plunged by 8.7 percent in October to the lowest level in seven
months, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
Each of the regions in the country shared in the loss which was
seen by analysts as fresh evidence of a moderating U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that sales of single-family homes
totaled a seasonally adjusted 714,000 annual rate, down sharply
from 782,000 in September. The sales were the lowest since a
713,000 rate last March when the sales plummeted by 9.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales slumped by 32.3 percent in the Northeast, the
steepest since they dropped by 33.6 percent in May 1993. Sales
fell by 11.3 percent in the Midwest, the biggest since February
1995. They were off by 8.9 percent in the West and 0.6 percent in
the South.
</P>
<P>
Still, sales in October remained above 700,000 for a 10th
straight month and they are 13.5 percent higher than those in the
first 10 months of last year.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted estimate of new homes for sale was
336,000 at the end of September, representing a supply of 5.6
months at the current sales rate, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. department reported late last month that existing home
sales in the country also dropped in October, the fifth straight
monthly decline.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Association of Home Builders said today that
a membership survey showed a four-point drop in its Housing Market
Index last month.
</P>
<P>
President Randy Smith of the association said the decline was
consistent with the general economic and housing slowdown that was
expected during the second half of the year.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Shiite Leaders Condemn Armed Attack on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese House Speaker Nabih
Berri denounced here today an armed attack on a prominent Muslim
Shiite leader in Najaf last week, calling it an "infringement
against a religious symbol."
</P>
<P>
Berri, leader of Lebanon's moderate Shiite Amal Movement,
congratulated Grand Ayatollah Ali Husseini Sistani's survival from
the November 25 attack on the Iraqi Shiite chief's house in the
city holy to Shiite Muslims the world over.
</P>
<P>
One of Sistani's attendants was killed and two others were
wounded when unidentified gunmen fired at the house, the
Lebanese house speaker told his visitors in his office.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Lebanese Higher Islamic Shiite
Council headed by Sheikh Mohammed Mahdi Shamseddin said that "A
group of wicked assailants, disguised in clerical attire, stormed
the headquarters of Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani and opened fire,
killing one person and wounding several others."
</P>
<P>
The council said Ayatollah Sistani "represents the wise and
enlightened (Shiite) authority that Muslims feel should be
protected."
</P>
<P>
It demanded that the assailants be exposed and punished
severely so that others like them will be deterred from carrying
out similar crimes and so that the integrity of Najaf will be
maintained.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual leader of the
Iranian-backed Shiite Hezbollah, or Party of God, issued a
statement accusing the Iraqi regime of being behind the attack
and held it responsible for Sistani's safety.
</P>
<P>
Ayatollah Sistani is the most senior religious scholar
residing in Najaf, which had been a main center of Shiite
scholars and disciplines until the Iranian holy city of Qom rose
to prominence in the wake of Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Sistani is a colleague of Lebanon's Sheikh Shamseddin and
Sheikh Fadlallah. All three were students of Ayatollah Abu
Al-Qasem Al-Khoei, who died three years ago in Najaf.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Ayatollah Al-Khoei's son, Mohammed Taqi, died in
a mysterious car accident near Karbala in south Iraq.
</P>
<P>
After the armed attack last week, the Iraqi government sent a
delegation to Sistani's house in Najaf to apologize for the
incident which was blamed on "thieves", according to local press
reports.

<HEADLINE> Ground Forces Chief Suspended, Not Sacked Yet: Kremlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A Kremlin spokesman today denied
Russia's Ground Forces Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Semyonov had
been sacked, saying that so far, he had only been suspended.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing in the Kremlin, Yeltsin's spokesman
Sergei Yastrzhembsky said that Semyonov will remain suspended from
his post until another decree is issued.
</P>
<P>
The special commission charged with all military appointments,
chaired by Defense Council Secretary Yuri Baturin, will study
whether such a decree is appropriate, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defense Ministry said on Monday that Semyonov had
been fired by President Boris Yeltsin for "actions discrediting
the honor and dignity of a serviceman."
</P>
<P>
However, on Monday night, Yeltsin's Press Service stated that
the Defense Ministry's statement was too hasty. It said Defense
Minister Igor Rodionov had requested the President to dismiss
Semyonov and that Yeltsin had only "agreed in principle."
</P>
<P>
Only with a final decision adopted by the special commission ,
will the President sign the decree, the press service said.
</P>
<P>
According to the press center of the Ground Forces, Semyonov was
summoned by the Defense Minister on November 29 and "informed
of his dismissal."
</P>
<P>
The decision came as "a complete surprise to Semyonov" and "he
does not agree with the wording of the reason for his dismissal,"
the press center said.
</P>
<P>
Semyonov met Baturin later on Monday in a bid to get more
information about the reasons for his sudden dismissal. But
Baturin turned out to be "unaware of the general's dismissal,"
the press center said.
</P>
<P>
Semyonov also told Izvestia (an independent newspaper) that the
Defense Minister had failed to present any formal charges, but
only hinting that the General is unlawfully involved in the
commercial activities of his wife Madlena Semyonova.
</P>
<P>
Madlena works at the Moscow representative office of the
Rosvertol helicopter manufacturer which supplies Mi combat and
cargo helicopters to the Russian army.
</P>
<P>
There is no evidence that Semyonov could have engaged in any
commercial activities for Rosvertol, Izvestia's chief military
correspondent Viktor Litivkin said.
</P>
<P>
Semyonov, 56, who became the Commander-in-Chief of Russia's
Ground Forces in 1991, was once considered as a possible
successor to the former Defense Minister Pavel Grachev.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that Semyonov's removal is in line with
Rodionov's drive to replace loyalists of his predecessor Grachev
with his own proteges. Rodionov may need his own men to push
forward military reform, which plans to cut Russia's
1.5-million-strong armed forces by 300,000.

security by making available cheaper imports, Radio Namibia
reported.
</P>
<P>
But he said SADC must also ensure cheaper imports do not undermine
agriculture, and the member states must strive to attract foreign
investment to the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Such a move will increase the financial viability of the
sector and facilitate transfer of technilogy, the SADC offciial
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Post Office today
announced a profit of nearly 1.6 billion U.S. dollars in fiscal
1996, the second successive year the agency won over a billion
dollar profit.
</P>
<P>
The gainings are attributed to the rate increase to 32 cents
for first-class mail that took effect in 1995 and mail volume
growth which also boosted the agency's income.
</P>
<P>
The office's performance was just 200 million dollars less than
1995's record earnings, "the best financial one-two punch in our
history," Postmaster General Marvin Runyon said.
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service posted total income of 56.4 billion dollars
in fiscal 1996, which ended on September 30 and a record volume of
182.7 billion pieces of mail.
</P>
<P>
In the previous fiscal year, the office earned a 1.77 billion
dollar profit, the first year profit since 1989 and also the
highest one recorded in its history.

<HEADLINE> UK Manufacturing Continues to Grow Slowly in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The manufacturing industry in
Britain expanded for the sixth month running in November, but the
pace of recovery remained slow, according to the latest monthly
survey by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply.
</P>
<P>
The institute's purchasing managers' index, a composite of
order books, output, stocks, delivery times and employment, fell
marginally last month to 54.4 from 54.5 in October. Any reading
over 50 indicates the sector is growing.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that factory order books were improving at
their fastest rate for two years and although the pound's recent
strength had dented factory orders from overseas, greater demand
from domestic customers was more than compensating.
</P>
<P>
Makers of consumer goods were seeing the biggest rise in
orders, as they had throughout the recent upturn in growth, but
orders for investment goods, such as expensive machinery and
components, were more sluggish, the report indicated.
</P>
<P>
Factory output continued to rise but at a slightly slower rate
than in October, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
Encouragingly, the strength of the pound, which rose about 10
percent between August and November, is also helping to keep
downward pressure on industry's raw material costs which fell for
the 13th month running in November.
</P>
<P>
"The recent increase in deflationary pressures was almost
entirely a result of the stronger pound making imported inputs
cheaper in sterling terms," the institute said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the survey may help Chancellor of the
Exchequer Kenneth Clarke to resist any Bank of England demands for
higher base rates at the next monetary meeting on December 11.

<HEADLINE> Lott Re-Elected Senate Republican Majority Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Republicans
today re-elected Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi their majority
leader in the next Congress.
</P>
<P>
The senators also selected their other leaders, all without
opposition and by acclamation, said Lott's press secretary, Susan
Irby.
</P>
<P>
Lott, 55, replaced Bob Dole as Republican leader last June,
when Dole resigned to concentrate on his now failed presidential
bid.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Democrats were expected to choose Senator Tom
Daschle as minority leader. Daschle, who will turn 49 next Monday,
would begin his third year as minority leader. He won his post by
a single vote two years ago over Senator Christopher Dodd, a
Democrat from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
Each party's senators were choosing their leaders in separate,
closed-door meetings in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
This year the Republicans' 53-47 Senate majority in the
previous Congress has expanded to 55-45 in the 105th Congress.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles retained his position today,
while Connie Mack was chosen for the No. 3 job of conference
chairman. Mack replaces Thad Cochran who promised not to seek the
job again after Lott defeated him for the top job by a 44-8
vote last June.
</P>
<P>
Also expected to return to their jobs on the Democratic side
are Senators Wendell Ford of Kentucky, the whip, and Barbara Mikulski
of Maryland, who is conference secretary.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM to Attend Friends of Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri is scheduled to leave Beirut on December 13 for Washington
to attend the Friends of Lebanon Conference scheduled to be held
on December 16.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed official sources close to the prime minister
today said that Hariri will be accompanied by Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz, Economy and Trade Minister Yassin Jaber and Fuad
Sinyoura, Minister of State for Financial Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The conference, a forum of donor countries on aid to Lebanon,
took its shape when the United States was negotiating an interim
cease-fire arrangement between Lebanon and Israel in April, which
ended a 17-day Israeli blitz in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hariri and his delegation will present some 31 reconstruction
projects to be executed in the next five years, the cost of which
is put at 5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has invited some 30 countries to
take part in the conference, including all the European Union
countries, oil-rich Arab states, some Asian countries like Japan
and Malaysia as well as leading international lending
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Despite the high political and financial hopes vested in the
conference, the Lebanese government is playing down expectations
for the Washington conference.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Boueiz said recently that he and Hariri
foresaw difficulties in winning a financial harvest in the
conference due partly to the prevailing political climate in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He also said some countries may not fulfill their pledges
because of budgetary or bureaucratic obstacles while other
countries may consider "past contributions as part of the plan."
</P>
<P>
In addition to 5 billion dollars in soft loans and
grants to finance the reconstruction projects, Lebanon will also
call for guarantee facilities of 1 billion dollars for the
government to gain further financing from international capital
market.
</P>
<P>
A report prepared by the government said that it hopes
"donors will indicate amounts they undertake to provide in the
form of grants and soft loans and the sectors and projects they
are interested in funding."
</P>
<P>
The report stated the sectors covered by the Friends of
Lebanon conference are those in which private investments are not
usually forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
It said investment will still be encouraged in areas more
compatible to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The report also outlined 31 projects and their costs to
facilitate the participants in the Friends of Lebanon Conference
to study and select.
</P>
<P>
Two infrastructure projects comprise a two-year project to
reduce pollution from three oil-fired electricity plants and a
five-year rehabilitation and development program for the
country's 3,520 kilometers of roads and the construction of 630
kilometers of new roads.
</P>
<P>
These projects cost 1.3 billion dollars, accounting for more
than one fifth of the 5 billion dollars hoped for.
</P>
<P>
Seven projects of social infrastructure at a cost of 1,08
billion dollars cover the construction of new schools,
vocational and technical centers, universities, hospitals and
low-cost housing.
</P>
<P>
The Dams and Water Transport program aims to supply water for
the Greater Beirut area by constructing a dam along the Awali
river and water pipes at a combined cost of 305 million dollars,
and a further 215 million dollars will be spent on building
irrigation dams and lakes.
</P>
<P>
The Water Supply program consists of a 540 million-dollar
project to complete the water and wastewater distribution
network, and a 130 million-dollar project to utilize the ground
water resources of the Anane basin to supply water to south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector will have 400 million dollars
allocated towards eight individual projects
</P>
<P>
The 200 million-dollar Public facilities and Institutions
program includes a 65 million-dollar project of constructing a
100,000-square-meter training center for police.

<HEADLINE> Greek Farmers Reject Government Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Greek farmers, who started
protest Thursday by blocking highways and the rail link between
Athens and Salonika, rejected today a package of measures put
forward by Agriculture Minister Stephanos Tzoumakas.
</P>
<P>
Tzoumakas, after chairing a meeting with representatives of
agricultural cooperatives, announced Monday night a number of
measures to satisfy the farmers' demands, which include a
40 drachma (about 0.17 U.S. dollar) increase for a kilogram of
cotton, favorable terms for settlement of outstanding debts and a
freezing of current debts. He also promised to ask the European
Commission for increased subsidies for stockbreeders.
</P>
<P>
Farmers said that they would continue their protests and
holding out for a meeting with the prime minister, who is due back
from Lisbon tonight.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, farmers in the Peloponnese decided to erect a
road block on the Patras-Pyrgos and Patras-Tripoli national road,
bringing the number of blockades around the country to more than
35.
</P>
<P>
By cutting all main roads leading to the major cities,
including Salonika, Patras, Aegio, Arta, Ioannina, and Xanthi, one
third of the country's transportation is now paralyzed. Serious
problem in distribution of goods throughout the country is
beginning to emerge.
</P>
<P>
The farmers demand lower fuel costs, lower value added tax on
farm equipment, higher price supports, especially for cotton, and
rescheduling 1.3 billion U.S. dollars in debts at state banks.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural minister said the demands put forward by the
farmers would cost 1 trillion drachmas (4.34 billion U.S.
dollars). "There is simply no such money," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Acting government spokesman Yiannis Nikolaou said today that
there is no question of Prime Minister Costas Simitis meeting with
protesting farmers. He called on organizers of the mobilizations
and the farmers to be aware that their actions created problems
affecting other social groups, and stop the protest.

<HEADLINE> Newark City Ex-Police Chief Sentenced to 30 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 3 (Xinhua) -- William R. Celester, former
police director of Newark City in New Jersey State, was sentenced
Monday to 30 months in prison for corruption, the New York Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Celester arrived in the scandal-plagued city of Newark in 1991
amid high hopes that he would improve the troubled police force.
But contrary to the hopes of the citizens, he made the police
force worse.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, Celester admitted in Federal Court that he
had taken 29,500 U.S. dollars from the bank account of the Police
Department, which was used for vocations to foreign countries and
gifts for his wife and girl friends.
</P>
<P>
He also admitted that he had kept 27,000 dollars improperly
donated by police subordinates at a 100-dollar-a-ticket fund
raiser in 1993. He used part of the money to buy a home in Newark
and to pay for trips to the Caribbeans.
</P>
<P>
He also admitted to filing a false Federal tax return in 1993.
He pleaded guilty to three fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, Celester told Judge Garrett E. Brown Jr. of
United States District Court in Trenton that he wanted to
apologize what he had put his family through.
</P>
<P>
Faith S. Hochberg, the United States Attorney for New Jersey,
said afterwards that she was satisfied with the 30-month prison
term. "The message is that if you are a top law enforcement
officer," she said, "you must yourself obey the law."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Attorney General Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Attorney General
Michael Ben-Yair resigned today under alleged pressure from the
government which was angered by his actions against several senior
officials.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Yair made the decision to resign two days ago and
submitted his resignation today to Justice Minister Tzahi
Hanegbi. He is to step down on January 1.
</P>
<P>
Announcing his dramatic resignation, Ben-Yair cited "the huge
workload and intensive activities under both the previous
government and current government" for his decision. He denied
any political pressure behind his move which he said was taken on
his personal initiative.
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's resignation created an uproar in the
country as the opposition was quick to blame the Likud government
for forcing him to resign because of his legal actions against
several senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Yair, appointed by the previous Labor government three
years ago, has been at odds with the Likud government since it
came to power in June.
</P>
<P>
His decision in June to indict current Agriculture Minister
Rafael Eitan, head of Tsomet Party and an election partner of
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, angered the Likud party which
refused to grant him the portfolio of justice minister.
</P>
<P>
Eitan was suspected of violating the Privacy Protection Law by
illegally extracting confidential documents from the Army
computers in order to force a Tsomet activist to leave the party.
</P>
<P>
Later Ben-Yair caused ripples within the Likud coalition when
he decided to investigate the alleged crimes by former Justice
Minister Ya'acov Ne'eman and Likud's Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert.
</P>
<P>
Ne'eman was forced to resign in August after Ben-Yair decided
to open a criminal investigation against him for allegedly
obstructing justice during the investigation of Aryeh Deri, a
Member of the Knesset (Parliament) from the Shas Party.
</P>
<P>
And hawkish Olmert was even more angry about the investigation
of his alleged fundraising scam eight years ago when he served as
the Likud Treasurer.
</P>
<P>
Labor's Knesset coalition Chairman Ra'anan Cohen denounced the
Likud government for forcing Ben-Yair to resign, saying this was
a blow to the country's democracy and the legal system.

<P>
PARIS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The abrupt rise of the U.S.
dollar against the French franc today boosted the values of French
stocks to a record high since February 2, 1994, and greatly
encouraged French and foreign investors to spend money on French
shares.
</P>
<P>
The CAC 40 Index of the Paris Bourse rose by 1.31 percent at
the end of the day today to 2,349.11, after attaining 2,358.65 two
hours and half before the closing of the stock exchange.

<P>
Other European stock markets, including Frankfurt, Amsterdam
and Madrid, also attained new record highs in stocks value today.
</P>

Debates over the monetary policies of the governments and the

<HEADLINE> Iran Rules out High-Level Visit to Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister
Mahmoud Vaezi today ruled out the possibility of a visit by
First Vice-President Hassan Habibi to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Vaezi said at a press conference here: "It is simply the
proposal by Iraq. I don't think there will be any visit in the
future."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official said that Iran is willing to reciprocate
any friendly gesture, but "there has been no decision yet."
</P>
<P>
Habibi met with Iraqi Vice-President Taha Mohedin in Rome
during the World Food Summit last month, the highest level
contact between Iran and Iraq in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Mohedin extended an invitation to his Iranian counterpart to
visit Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
On October 16, Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani
received Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's special envoy who
voiced Iraq's desire for good neighborly relations with Iran and
for expansion of mutual relations.
</P>
<P>
In return, President Rafsanjani underlined the need for
making efforts to solve the issue of war prisoners and to
completely enforce all articles of the U.N. Resolution 598 on
ceasefire between the two warring parties.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian president still regards Saddam Hussein
as the major threat to the peace and tranquility in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He told German Weekly Der Spiegel recently "if they are given
a free hand they will destabilize the region, and they do still
have a lot of capabilities in that regard."
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year war from 1980 to 1988. Iran
says it wants to normalize relations with the former enemy, but
there are some big problems, including the prisoners of war, which
block the way for improvement of the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Although the two countries maintained a ceasefire since August
1988, there is no real peace between the two rivals. During the
past years, both sides reported the other's ceasefire violations
to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In the border areas, there exists a "no war and no peace"
state. The two countries still deploy a large number of armed
forces along their borders.
</P>
<P>
Both sides criticized the other for lack of trust and
sincerity in talks.

<HEADLINE> OAU Calls to Support Africa's 60 Million Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 3 (xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) today called on all member states to support activities
in favour of over 60 million disabled persons in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The call was contained in an OAU press release issued here today
to mark the international day of disabled persons which was
proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The press release said by proclaiming 1981 as the international
year of disabled persons as well as the international decade of the
disabled persons by the UN General Assembly, the General
Secretariat of the OAU, in collaboration with the International
abor Organization (ILO), initiated the creation of the African
Rehabilitation Institution (ARI).
</P>
<P>
The OAU member states, it said, launched the ARI in Harare,
Zimbabwe in 1986 with branches in Brazzaville, Congo and Dakar,
Senegal while those in northern and eastern regions of africa are yet
to be created. It is to be recalled that for ARI to become fully
operational a minimum of nine refitications of the agreement
establishing the institute were required.
</P>
<P>
The institute's governing board chaired by the Secretary
General of the OAU, has initiated and implemented a number of
viable projects in favour of disabled persons in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Most OAU member states are becoming more and more aware of the
need to undeceive the stigmatization of disability issues and in
this connection are promoting the integration of persons with
disabilities in every aspect of social and economic life.
</P>
<P>
The release appealed to those member states which have not
done so to ratify the agreement establishing ARI, as well as to
contribute to the regular budget of the institute in support of its
programs. enditem

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Renews Call for Demilitarization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides today renewed his call for demilitarization of his
country.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot president made the appeal at the summit of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which
is currently underway in Lisbon, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Clerides reiterated his proposal for the demilitarization
of Cyprus which "would go a long way towards diffusing a constant
threat not only to the security of Cyprus but also to the
stability in the region".
</P>
<P>
The president sent a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali in December 1993, proposing the withdrawal
of foreign troops and settlers, the disbanding of the military
forces and the positioning of a multinational force on the island.
</P>
<P>
"It is my belief that the OSCE can promote this proposal
and that it can play an important role in overseeing its
implementation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus "earnestly expects some mechanism for joint OSCE
action in cases of non-compliance with the Helsinki Declaration
of Principles by a member-state", Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
He also backed closer cooperation between the OSCE and other
organizations, such as the Council of Europe, and reaffirmed his
government's commitment to developing further dialogue with its
Mediterranean partners for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In another development, President of the House of
Representatives Spyros Kyprianou recently has demanded to send
packing the two British bases in southern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
After years of struggle against British colonial rule, Cyprus
gained independence in 1960. But under the 1960 Treaty, Britain
retained two military bases on Cyprus' southern coast and other
facilities in various parts of this East Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops landed
and seized 37 percent of the island following an Athens-backed
coup.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has rejected Cypriot application for full EU
membership, citing the current split on the east Mediterranean
island poses an obstacle.
</P>
<P>
Repeated UN efforts to reunite the island into a bizonal and
bicommunal federal state have failed to yield any concrete
results.

<HEADLINE> MP Scott Deselected as Candidate by His Won Constituency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Former Conservative minister
Nicholas Scott lost his battle to remain an MP Monday night after
being deselected by his London constituency association.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of about l,000 Tories in Kensington and Chelsea
constituency voted by 509 to 439 to deselect him as their
candidate for the next election.
</P>
<P>
The decision came despite a last-minute appeal to the
association members from more than 100 Tory MPs for them to retain
Nicholas as their candidate.
</P>
<P>
Monday night's meeting was triggered by news that Nicholas'
recent conviction for drink-driving and being found face down on
the pavement in Bournemouth after a drinks party during the party
conference last October.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas admitted to drinking "too heavily" in the past. But he
repeated his explanation that a mixture of painkillers and two
glasses of white wine had led him to collapse on the pavement in
Bournemouth and promised never to touch alcohol again.
</P>
<P>
However, the Tories in Kensington and Chelsea constituency
dismissed his explanation by refusing to pass a vote of confidence
in him.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Dalton, the constituency chairman, said, "My feeling is
sadness for Sir Nicholas. But from the association point of view
it was abundantly clear from the meeting that they were against
him."
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that the constituency move
will undoubtedly embarrass the Tory government.

TEHRAN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran, Armenia, Georgia and
Greece today held the second quadrilateral meeting of deputy
foreign ministers in a bid to expand cooperation in fields of
trade and transportation.
</P>
<P>
The four countries have proposed to establish four committees
on telecommunications, tourism, industry, trade, economy and
energy.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi, Armenian Deputy
Foreign Minister Sergei Manasarian, Georgian Deputy Foreign
Minister Malkhaz Kakabadzadeh and Greek Foreign Ministry's
Secretary-General Konstantin Gorio are leading their respective
delegations.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that cooperation of the four countries is
politically important because Armenia and Greece were believed to
be historical enemies of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
While Iran is courting friendship of both to find an
alternative for its outlet to Europe, it is worried about the
close ties between Turkey and Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Vaezi made it clear
that the economic cooperation in the region is aimed at more
closer ties among the regional countries and is not detrimental to
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the two-day meeting, Vaezi
said the independence of the Central Asian and Caucasian
republics has provided an opportunity for Iran to go on bilateral
and regional cooperation with the republics.
</P>
<P>
He added that regional cooperation is an priority in the
diplomacy of Iran. Iran believes that regional cooperation is an
important means for guaranteeing peace and security in the region
and that's why Iran is seriously interested in bilateral,
trilateral and quadrilateral cooperation with the regional states.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Republic of Iran, as an important transit route
with abundant energy sources is ready to develop cooperation using
the economic potential of the countries in the region," he added.

The foreign ministers of Iran, Armenia, Greece and Georgia
are expected to hold meeting in Athens in January.

KUWAIT, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister
and Finance Minister Nasser al-Rudhan announced today that
Kuwait rejects in principle the resumption of relations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks at a Assembly sitting. He said
that Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad
al-Abdullah al-Salem al-Sabah had earlier emphasized that "there
is no one Kuwaiti citizen who favors the resumption of

Council resolutions related to the invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
On Kuwait's attitude towards those countries that supported
Iraq during the 1991 Gulf war, the Kuwaiti minister said that this
depended on the position of those states towards the
implementation of international resolutions, particularly the
freeing of Kuwaiti prisoners of war, the repatriation of stolen
Kuwaiti properties and the payment of indemnity.
</P>

PARIS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- President Jacques Chirac vowed
this evening to fight terrorism after a bomb explosion killed two
people and wounded at least eight gravely on a train in downtown
Paris this evening.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Alain Juppe and Interior Minister Jean-Louis
Debre have confirmed that the explosion was caused by a bomb.
</P>
<P>
"It is soon afterwards established that it was a bomb of very
strong power," Juppe said, adding that he could not provide any
details.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the bomb could be a 13-kilogram heavy gas
demijohn which is usually resorted to by Islamic extremists in
Algeria.
</P>
<P>
However, other extremist groups, such as the FLNC-Canal
Historique of Corsica and the Basque separatist group of ETA, are
also likely to be the terrorist attacker in the explosion, which
greatly shocked the French capital this evening.
</P>
<P>
The station of Port Royal for the express railway network for
Paris and its suburbs, near the famous Luxembourg Park, is now
heavily guarded by paramilitary police and anti-riot police, as
ambulances and fire engines whistled through the streets nearby.
</P>
<P>
Twenty other people were more lightly wounded while hospital
sources described three people as in a desperate situation.
</P>

today on a new door-to-door transport system which would facilitate
trade exchanges between the two sides under the 1994

The agreement, which had long been cherished by Jordanian

within the context of joint transport committee which oversees

Israel.

Meanwhile, the two countries agreed to dismantle the old

<P>
The accord would also allow Jordanian cement and petrol to be
trucked into Palestinian territories directly via the King
Hussein bridge, which is the key passage between Jordan and the
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the amendment to the Jordanian-Israeli
transport will eliminate border delays and reduce shipping costs
for the Jordanian exporters.
</P>
<P>
A sub-committee of the Jordanian-Israeli joint transport
committee took the decision last week to replace the inefficient
back-to-back system of transport after months of complaints from
Jordanian exporters.
</P>
<P>
Since the implementation of the transport agreement in June,
Jordanian businessmen have complained that the back-to-back system
- a measure insisted upon by Israel when signing the transport
accord - was an obstacle to bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The system required that consignments of goods moving from
Jordan to Israel or the Palestinian self-rule areas be unloaded
from Jordanian vehicles, inspected by Israeli security and
reloaded onto Israeli or Palestinian vehicles before continuing
to their destinations.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials and businessmen claimed that Jordanian
vehicles would be delayed for hours and, in some cases, days,
although the security check was not supposed to take more than a
couple of hours.
</P>
<P>
The system also brought exporters considerable added expenses,
including a crossing fee, a per ton unloading and reloading
fee, and fines imposed on export companies whose vehicles were
delayed at the border, all of which made Jordanian products
less competitive, they said.
</P>
<P>
The new amendment was widely seen as an incentive to
increase commercial exchanges between Jordan, Egypt, Israel and
the Palestinian self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> Russian Defense Chief Postpones US Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Rodionov has postponed his official visit to the United States,
originally slated for December 4-8, due to "domestic matters," the
Russian Defense Ministry's press center said today.
</P>
<P>
It declined to comment on reasons for the visit's postponement,
saying only that the move was due to "domestic matters."
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the minister's visit was put off
because of the situation regarding the dismissal of Russian Land
Forces Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Semyonov.
</P>
<P>
According to the presidential press service, Rodionov had asked
President Boris Yeltsin to sack Semyonov from his post, and the
president had agreed "in principle."
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defense Ministry's press service circulated Monday
a press release saying, "Semyonov was relieved of his post by the
decision of the Russian president and supreme commander-in-chief
for actions discrediting the honor and dignity of a serviceman
incompatible with his official position."
</P>
<P>
A source close to Semyonov said today, "If no specific charges
are brought against the general, he would contest the motivation
of his dismissal in court."
</P>
<P>
Semyonov himself declared he did not agree to "the wording of
the motivation" of his ouster and would "defend his honor and
dignity to the end."
</P>
<P>
The presidential press service said today that the president
will make a final decision over the matter only after a special
presidential commission on top military officers appointments
holds a meeting over the proposed dismissal.

<HEADLINE> Terrorist Attack on Paris Train Shocks France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- France was greatly shocked and
angered this evening by a terrorist bomb attack on an underground
train in downtown Paris, and President Jacques Chirac has ordered
a relentless fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"It is doubtlessly an act of barbarity, of terrorism. My first
concern goes to the victims, to their families, to the wounded and
their friends," said Chirac on the steps of the Elysee
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
He said that his prime minister Alain Juppe, who went to the
scene soon after the explosion took place at 18:03 (1603 GMT), was
launching a man-hunt operation dubbed "Vigipirate" against the
attacker.
</P>
<P>
"Before these unacceptable acts, these barbarous acts, which
always attack innocent people, I would like to tell you, my dear
compatriots, my determination, that of the government, that of the
whole nation, to fight with all means necessary against the
terrorism under all forms," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The French National Assembly has expressed its sympathy to the
families of the victims of the attack, while the Paris mayor Jean
Tiberi described the attack as "mean and cowardly."
</P>
<P>
The Union pour la Democratie Francaise, one of the ruling
parties, has called on all French people to unite around President
Chirac to fight terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Accuse US of Violating Dayton Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior Bosnian Serb official
has accused the United States of violating the Dayton agreement in
regard to the arbitration of the controversial town of Brcko in
northern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Serb Prime Minister Gojko Klickovic said today in the Serb
administrative center of Pale that Republika Srpska had been
forced to withdraw its member from the arbitration commission for
Brcko because the United States had put pressure on commission
Chairman Roberts Owen to flout the envisaged rules in the
arbitration and had promised the Muslim-Croat Federation that a
solution in its favor would be reached.
</P>
<P>
Both Muslims and Serbs claimed sovereignty over Brcko, a
strategic town which links the northwestern and eastern parts of
the Serb entity. Under the Dayton agreement, an international
arbitration must be completed concerning the fate of Brcko within
one year after the peace accord was signed last December in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Klickovic told reporters that Brcko was a Serb town and that an
international protectorate was out of the question, according to a
Tanjug news agency report from Pale.
</P>
<P>
He warned that "the price of such decision (against the Serbs)
is a war" and that the U.S. pressure showed that Washington "does
not want peace in the region."
</P>
<P>
The Republika Srpska government decided to withdraw its
representative from the arbitral tribunal on December 1. The
tribunal was comprised of a Serb, a Muslim and an international
arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
The Serb premier expressed the hope that the other members of
the international community would be able to find a just solution
and said the subject of the dispute, which the Dayton agreement
determined as a part of the inter-entity boundary near Brcko, was
now being expanded to the entire region.
</P>
<P>
The Sarajevo Muslim government wants to control Brcko, although
the Dayton agreement envisages that the arbitration commission
should determine the line of separation between Republika Srpska
and the Muslim-Croat Federation.

<HEADLINE> Iran Bans Use of Foreign Words, Names </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran's parliament today ratified
a bill that would make it illegal for both government and the
private sector to use foreign words and names.
</P>
<P>
That is part of the efforts made by the Islamic regime to
fight against the western cultural invasion and to safeguard
the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The government departments from now on are required to use
only Persian words and names and avoid the use of foreign words
in their official correspondence and speech.
</P>
<P>
The new law also requires Iran's state-run radio and
television to avoid using foreign words and names, and instead use
words authorized by Iran's Academy of Persian Literature and
Language.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Dezfuli, a Persian literature professor at Tehran
University, said that the move by the Parliament would "rid the
language from the invasion of foreign words."
</P>
<P>
Most observers believe that the foreign words will not include
Arabic words that constitute about half of the words used in
the Persian language.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Arabic is the language of the holy Koran,
therefore, it is excluded from the rule.
</P>
<P>
The new law intends to purge the Persian language from words
coming from English, French, German and other western languages.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Stresses Equal Rights for Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today said that persons with disabilities
should enjoy their civil, political, social and cultural rights on
an equal basis with other people.
</P>
<P>
In a message on the occasion of the International Day of
Disabled Persons, he said, the United Nations has been at the
forefront of efforts to improve the lives of the disabled
throughout the world from its inception.
</P>
<P>
The Organization's Charter affirms the principles of
fundamental freedoms, the dignity and worth of human beings and
the promotion of social progress and better standards of life, he
reviewed.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration Human
Rights in 1948, the World Program of Action concerning Disabled
Persons in 1982 and the Standard Rules on the Equalization of
Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 World Summit for Social Development and other recent
UN conferences have emphasized the need for people-centered
sustainable development, with the eradication of poverty as a
cornerstone. The Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development
points out that people with disabilities form one of the world's
largest minorities, more than one person in 10, and are often
forced into poverty, unemployment and social isolation, he said.
</P>
<P>
In developing countries, most disabled persons are the poorest
in the community, with little or no access to health care or
rehabilitation or support services. Even in developed countries,
studies reveal higher proportions of disabled persons among the
poorest strata of society.
</P>
<P>
"In our continuing effort to build a just society for all, and
in our common endeavor to fight poverty, we recognize that society
needs all persons with disabilities to be active participants," he
said.
</P>
<P>
UN statistics show that a total of 250-300 million people are
severely or moderately disabled in the world. Though the disabling
causes are various, including congenital and postnatal
disturbances, diseases, alcoholism, drug abuse, violence and
injuries, people living in poverty tend to become disabled because
of malnutrition, squalid housing, hazardous occupations and
heightened exposure to violence.
</P>
<P>
UN agencies call on all countries to adopt more effective
prevention measures and increase rehabilitation programs to
empower the disabled with education, vocational training and
health care.

TUNIS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Zine
al-Abidine Ben Ali and visiting Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
held talks here today on bilateral relations and cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Their talks also dealt with regional and international issues
of mutual concern and the Middle East peace process stalled by
Israel's violation of the signed agreements, the Tunisian News
Agency quoted a Tunisian presidential spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents stressed the importance of furthering
cooperation between Tunisia and Egypt, and the activation of trade
exchanges and joint ventures through intensified contacts among
the two countries' officials and businessmen, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two presidents also expressed their deep
concern over the dangers posed to the peace process along
all tracks and exchanged views on Arab and African issues.
</P>
<P>
They discussed the consequences of the air flights embargo
imposed by U.N. against Libya for its refusal to hand over two
Libyans allegedly involved in the 1988 bombing of a U.S. airliner
that killed 270 people over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the two presidents renewed the call for
ending the Libyan-western dispute with a view to alleviate the
sufferings of the Libyan people.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The second phase of the
disbandment of the former rebel group UNITA's under-18 soldiers
started today in Angola's northern Uige Province.
</P>
<P>
This was announced today by Angola's Minister of Social
Resettlement Albino Malungo.
</P>
<P>
The minister said only those children soldiers who have found
their parents can leave the assembling camps today.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of the children soldiers dismissed in September
and October this year have not found their families, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that only 600-odd children soldiers from the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) were
disbanded in the first phase.
</P>
<P>
Malungo predicted that during this phase, less than 1,000 will
be repatriated in the coming two months due to insufficient
preparations. This falls far short of the original target of
7,000 soldiers, he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Fine art auctioneers of the
Sotheby's are to mount an exhibition on the eve of the historic
hand-over of Hongkong to China by Britain to celebrate the trade
links forged with the Far East over three centuries.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, A Tale of Three Cities: Canton, Shanghai and
Hongkong - Three Centuries of Sino-British Trade in the Decorative
Arts, organized by Sotheby's will run from January 6 to February
8, 1997, according to a press release here today.
</P>
<P>
It will take over all available public space in Sotheby's
London offices which will be extensively remodeled to create a
visually stunning setting worthy of the treasures that will be on
display.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, the first of its kind, will encompass more than
300 carefully chosen and surprisingly diverse exhibits. Most have
been loaned by private and corporate collections in both Britain
and Asia, while others are from museums worldwide, including the
Peabody Museum, Salem, Mass, the company said.
</P>
<P>
The extent of the trade over past three centuries was vast. At
least a hundred million pieces of porcelain reached Britain in the
18th century alone and some of the most spectacular of these will
be exhibited.
</P>
<P>
Among the entries is one for a porcelain service listed in East
India Company's Canton journal for December 20, 1727, as having
been loaded on to the Price Augustus, anchored at Whampoa in the
Pearl River below Canton. The same service survives today and a
teapot from it will be among the exhibits.
</P>
<P>
In addition to every sort of porcelain, the exhibition will
include all of the other decorative art: enamel, silver, pewter,
soapstone, lacquer, painted mirrors, silk, carpets, wallpaper,
furniture and paintings, Sotheby's said.

UNITED NATIONS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations today
appealed for 133 million dollars to ensure the continuation of
humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan, a war-afflicted country.
</P>
<P>
The people of Afghanistan, which has the highest rates of
infant, childhood and maternal mortality in Asia, are about to
face their eighteenth winter at war, according to the UN
Department of Humanitarian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Some 500,000 people in the capital of Kabul alone will depend
on food relief to survive the winter. In addition, the recent
intensification of the civil conflict has only exacerbated the
difficult living conditions of an already poor population.
</P>
<P>
The UN department also noted that there are about 10 million
land mines in the country. Accidents are expected to increase in
the coming months as people search for scarce firewood in mined
areas.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations called upon the international community to
respond generously to this appeal, to relieve the protracted
suffering of the Afghan people and to provide a basis for
longer-term rehabilitation and reconstruction of the country.

<HEADLINE> Beilin to Run For Israel's Labor Party Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Yossi Beilin, an architect of
the Oslo Accords, said today that he will contend for leadership
of Israeli's opposition Labor Party with concrete ideas to solve
the Palestinia-Israeli conflicts in line with Labor veteran
Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Tel Aviv, Beilin said that he
had made the decision since the 73-year-old Peres announced he
would not stand again for the party chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
Beilin reportedly discussed the issue with Peres and some other
party figures after last Thursday's Labor central committee
meeting, which set the date for the end of Peres' term as party
leader and schedued the leadership showdown for June 3 next year.
</P>
<P>
Peres said at the meeting he would support whoever is elected
to take his place. Beilin, a Peres protege, served as deputy
foreign minister and minister of economic planning in the former
Labor govenment.
</P>
<P>
Other candidates include former Foreign Minister Ehud Barak,
former Health Minister Ephraim Sneh and possibly former Interior
Minister Haim Ramon and ex-Tourism Minister Uzi Baram. Barak so
far appears to be the favorite choice.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Beilin said that he would
follow the Peres line without Peres regarding the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I am coming to the arena not with opening positions, but with
some solutions. I am coming with an understanding with the
Palestinians, though not a signed one, about a permanent
solution. I think it is the most important thing," he stated.
</P>
<P>
He continued: "I am coming with very concrete ideas about
the solution about the Arab-israeli conflict, and also about
our social issues."
</P>
<P>
On Jerusalem, Beilin said: "The bottom line for the solution of
Jerusalem would be to distinguish between the Palestinian
definition of Al-Quds and Israeli definition which means actually
the municiple Jerusalem, which was annexed to Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
"Since Al-Quds of the Palestinians is wider than Jerusalem
itself, once there is a Palestinian state -- I don't think there
might be a solution of the Palestinian problem with a Palestinian
state -- they may have their capital in Al-Quds which is out of
the united Jerusalem itself," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't suggest that Israel give up its sovereignty over
Jerusalem," he added.
</P>
<P>
In a historic decision, Israel's then ruling Labor Party
dropped its long-held opposition to the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state in April.

<HEADLINE> Small Frozen Lake Found on Moon, Pentagon Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A military spacecraft has
found that the moon has a pond of ice hidden deep inside a crater,
the Pentagon announced here today, increasing chances that people
may someday live on the Earth's satellite.
</P>
<P>
The discovery came from the Clementine spacecraft, which was
launched two years ago mainly for military uses. It used radar
signals to examine the depths of the moon's deep craters and the
discovery of ice was an unexpected byproduct.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said radio waves were bounced from Clementine into
the crater and back to dish antennas of the Deep Space Network on
Earth. The radio waves could distinguish ice -- at least
tentatively -- because rocks and soil scatter them but the smooth
surface of ice bounces them back in a coherent pattern.
</P>
<P>
Most of the possible ice appears to be at the bottom of the
deepest crater near the moon's south pole, in a pond about 366
meters long and 5 meters to 10 meters deep, it said. And
scientists who led the research believe the water for the ice was
brought to the moon by moist comets that slammed into moon about
3.6 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
The crater, named South Pole-Aitkin basin, is about 2,500 kms
in diameter and up to 13 km deep. It is largely in permanent
darkness so that the water would be trapped as ice in temperatures
near absolute zero, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
"The discovery of ice on the moon has enormous implications for
a permanent human return to the moon," it said, and "the water
from lunar polar ice and oxygen generated from the ice could
support a permanent facility or outpost on the moon."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Apollo spacecraft teams visited the moon in a series
missions from July 1969 to December 1972, but none of them had
found any traits of water.
</P>
<P>
The Clementine is a 75 million US dollar program launched in
January 1994 that uses the moon as a target to test "Star War"
sensors and other devices for a U.S. antimissile missile defense.
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
co-sponsored the project with the Pentagon and supplied a team of
scientists to analyse information from it.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The White House today
confirmed that U.S. President Bill Clinton is expected to meet
Russian President Boris Yeltsin next year, possibly in the first
half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters that Clinton
had raised the matter informally in a letter to Yeltsin. The
letter was delivered by Vice President Al Gore to Russian Prime
Minister Victor Chernomyrdin on Monday in Lisbon, where the two
met at a European security summit.
</P>
<P>
"The president added a personal postscript saying that he
looks forward to seeing President Yeltsin soon," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
"The Russians have said they hope that will be sometime in the
first half of 1997, and I'd say that probably makes a lot of
sense," McCurry said, adding that no date or place has been set.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, a Kremlin spokesman said Yeltsin planned to
meet Clinton in the first half of 1997.

<P>
ANKARA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel today called for increased schooling facilities
for the handicapped.
</P>
<P>
Marking the World Handicapped Day, he said: " Only 2.5 percent
of the children who need special education benefit from
educational services."
</P>
<P>
The president also said that administrative and legal working
regulations for the handicapped are insufficient and improperly
implemented and must be amended as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Health Minister Yildirim Aktuna said at a meeting in
Ankara that the 6.6 million handicapped people living in Turkey
encountered many problems in cities and that the first step
toward a solution is to meet the needs of the disabled.
</P>
<P>
He noted that protective health precautions would mostly
eliminate congenital handicaps and that marriage between
relatives should be prevented immediately.
</P>
<P>
According to a Turkish official, every year 10,000 handicapped
people applied for jobs in Turkey and that only 5,000 of those were
employed.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has a total of 110 schools and educational and
vocational centers for the disabled, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Necdet Ozturk, chairman of the Turkish Handicapped Foundation,
said that Turkey currently has one confederation, four
federations, and over 50 voluntary organizations providing
services to the handicapped.
</P>
<P>
Ozturk added that 41 percent of the handicaps are the
result of traffic accidents, 21 percent due to birth defects, 24
percent due to occupational accidents and 8 percent due to
terrorist incidents while 6 percent were caused by individual
carelessness.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Chavalit in Bid to Reshape Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's new cabinet held its
first meeting Monday after it was sworn in last Sunday and new
Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh made apparent efforts to
restructure the administrative body.
</P>
<P>
At the Monday meeting, the prime minister urged his cabinet
members to stress honesty and transparency and work as a team to
hold collective responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Civil servants might be invited to attend cabinet meetings to
explain issues of contention.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit told his ministers that weekly cabinet meetings will
be efficient and punctual and some modern audio-visual equipment
will be introduced to replace the stacks of documents used in
presentations.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that Chavalit also had asked cabinet
members to keep cabinet agendas confidential and stressed that
honesty and confidentiality are necessary to develop discipline
and ethics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ministers at the meeting were reminded to declare
their assets and liabilities in 15 days.
</P>
<P>
Significant personnel arrangements were also made at the
cabinet meeting, with some believed to be radical.
</P>
<P>
Chatichai Choonhavan, leader of the Chart Pattana (National
Development) Party (CPP) who does not take any post in the
cabinet, was confirmed as the special adviser to the prime
minister on economic and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan has been appointed
chairman of the Council of Economic Ministers, which used to be
chaired by the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Education Minister Sukhavich
Ransitphol will chair the Council of Social Ministers.
</P>
<P>
The economic ministers will meet on Monday mornings and the
social ministers will meet in the afternoon. They will review
those issues to be presented to the weekly cabinet meeting
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Warathep Ratanakorn, a parliamentary member from the New
Aspiration Party, has been nominated as government spokesman and
Chavalit said that the post of government spokesman is very
important in preventing confusion.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the cabinet Monday dissolved 437 committees set up
by the Banharn administration. Visanu Krua-ngarm,
secretary-general of the cabinet, said some of the axed panels
only met once after their establishment.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit said he would rely on government agencies, the media
and the opposition to ensure that there was no dishonesty among
his ministers.

<HEADLINE> Australian Economy Grows At Slower Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Australian economy was
growing at a slower pace in the September quarter.
</P>
<P>
The national accounts released by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS) today showed that the economy grew 0.8 percent
seasonally adjusted in the three months to September.
</P>
<P>
This made an annual growth rate of 3.8 percent, down from 4.7
percent in the 12 months to June.
</P>
<P>
However, on quarterly terms, the economic growth rate rose to
0.8 percent in the September quarter from 0.1 percent in the June
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said that the economic
growth rate was solid.
</P>
<P>
ABS figures showed that the economic growth in the September
quarter was led by increases in business investment and stocks and
improvement in the country's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
"That's just what you want to see as you look down the track,"
Costello said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the coalition government's strategy was to steer
the economy into a path of sustained growth instead of the
stop-start process of the past decade.
</P>
<P>
"What we need is a nice easy acceleration," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has cut interest rates twice since July. It
forecast an annual growth rate of 3.5 percent in 1996-97 in its
August budget.
</P>
<P>
Costello and other cabinet ministers have predicted a pick-up
in business investment and economic activities in the first half
of next year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar rallied in exchange rates against the US
dollar after expectations of a further cut in the official
interest rates failed to materialize today.
</P>
<P>
Local business circles have been calling for the Reserve Bank
of Australia (RBA) to cut interest rates by another 0.5 percent in
order to offset the impact of a stronger Australian dollar on
inflation and exports.
</P>
<P>
Former RBA governor Bernie Fraser helped boost the rate cut
speculations by saying late Tuesday that the RBA should cut the
cash rate by one percent without any risk of raising inflation
pressures. The Australian dollar was knocked down by over one and
a half US cents against the US dollar overnight following his
comments.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar surged above 80 US cents this morning as
the foreshadowed interest rate cut failed to come through.

MADRID, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said here today that the Middle East peace
process would continue, but under a basic condition that the
security of the Israelis is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who arrived earlier today to mark the fifth
anniversary of the landmark 1991 Middle East peace conference,
said the peace process is now facing "obstacles."
</P>
<P>
He made the statement at a joint press conference with his
Spanish counterpart Jose Maria Aznar after their meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Prime Minister expressed optimism however about the
the peace process by vowing to "push it forward" to find a "just
and lasting solution."
</P>
<P>
Asked if there is any possibility of resuming the
Israeli-Syrian talks, Netanyahu said that "there are no
prerequisites on the part of Israel."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who also met King Juan Carlos, denied that his
country is moving troops on the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the role of the European Union in the Middle East
peace process, Aznar said that the EU had no intention to "exclude
anyone" but to "prod all sides to undertake political dialogue."
</P>
<P>
The Spanish prime minister ruled out the possibility of holding
a second Middle East peace conference in Madrid as claimed by some
press reports, saying there is "no reason" to do so at present.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Consumer Price Index Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's consumer price index
(CPI) rose 4.8 percent in November against 4.3 percent in October,
a rise of 0.5 percent caused primarily by a surge in non-food
items, according to the local press today.
</P>
<P>
The CPI for the first 11 months of the year rose 5.9 percent,
up from 4.6 percent in the first 10 months. The latest figures
indicate inflation this year might surpass the Bank of Thailand's
forecast of 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Newly-appointed Commerce Minister Narogachai said to meet the
target, consumer price could rise no more than 1.1. percent in
December.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the November CPI rise to increased prices in the
non-food sector which grew 3.3 percent compared with November
1995. Non-food prices rose 0.9 percent from October's level.
</P>
<P>
Among non-food items, the Thai Commerce Ministry said the
biggest price increases were in tobacco and alcoholic beverages.
Partly because of the imposition of higher excise taxes on tobacco
in October, the prices of tobacco and alcoholic beverages rose 9.8
percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the biggest price increases for food items
were on rice and flour. Rice and flour prices rose 12.4 percent
year-on-year and 1.5 percent month-on-month in November because of
scarcities, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Meat and seafood prices rose 7.3 percent year-on-year, wool and
dairy product prices rose 7.2 percent year-on-year.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien today promised Ottawa's "full support" for France's fight
against terrorism following a bomb explosion in Paris subway.
</P>
<P>
Two people were killed and dozens wounded when a bomb tore
apart a crowded subway car in the city heart Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
"You can count on Canada's support, as a committed ally," the
Canadian prime minister told French President Jacques Chirac in a
letter, according to local press.
</P>
<P>
Chretien also extended condolences to the families and friends
of the victims of "this barbarous crime."
</P>
<P>
France, target of frequent attacks of Algerian Islamic
extremists and Corsican separatists, has been in fight with
terrorism for many years.
</P>
<P>
After today's explosion, the French government immediately
revived the "Vilipirate" operation launched after a similar bomb
attack on the Saint-Michel subway station in downtown Paris, which
killed eight people and wounded 159 in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
In response to the bombing, President Chirac ordered a
relentless fight against terrorism in the country and Prime
Minister Alain Juppe, who went to the scene, commanded a manhunt
of the attackers.
</P>
<P>
The bomb blew up when the train was still running in the tunnel
before stopping at Port Royal station near Luxembourg Park, and a
whole car was completely reduced to debris with parts of human
bodies flying all around, said eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
Police have found the debris of a 13-kilogram heavy gas
demijohn, which is supposed to be the bomb.
</P>
<P>
French police said Algerian Islamic extremists are the first
suspect of the attack, judging from the fact that adapted gas
canisters are their usual weapon and their attacks are almost
unexceptionally targeted against civilians, rather than structural
damage.

<HEADLINE> Non-Resident Workers' Kids in Cities Can Go to School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Non-resident labourers in major
Chinese cities are likely to have their children receive regular
schooling similar to local residents, which could rarely be done
before.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing's Fengtai District, where most of the non-resident
workers live, the Beijing Education Administration (BEA) piloted a
regulation this summer to ensure compulsory education for
school-age children whose parents work as itinerant labourers.
</P>
<P>
So far, some 3,869 pupils, or 96 percent of the total, have
been recruited at more than 180 primary schools and middle schools
in the district, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the regulation, children age 7-15 who hold temporary
residence certificate in the district can enter schools by paying
1,000 yuan in tuition each year, and these children attend the
same class with the other children.
</P>
<P>
The regulation is expected to be expanded in the capital's other
district next year, said a spokesman for the BEA.
</P>
<P>
It is also likely to spread to other cities where transient
populations are relatively large, according to the State Education
Commission.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China had 80 million transient workers, and the number
is still on the increase.

Agency (IAEA) said today that it would hold a new round of talks
in January next year with the Democratic People's Republic of

failed.

The new talks, which are being held because previous
negotiations failed, were announced by Hans Blix, director-general
of the Agency, at the opening session of a two-day meeting of the
IAEA Board of Governors here.
</P>
<P>
Blix said the previous talks between the IAEA and the DPRK, on
September 23-27, had produced no results on the resumption of
nuclear inspection in the DPRK as both sides disagreed on a number
of key issues.

<P>
The DPRK withdrew from the IAEA in June 1994 about four months
after it agreed to allow the IAEA to inspect seven of its nuclear
facilities.
</P>

The DPRK last October signed a framework agreement with the
United States in Geneva. It agreed to shut down a
graphite-moderated reactor which is believed to be capable of
producing materials used for making nuclear weapons. In exchange
it was to get heavy oil and the lifting or easing of the United
States sanctions against it.

Pyongyang also agreed to put its frozen nuclear facilities
under the supervision of the Vienna-based IAEA and allow the

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Bank Chief Predicts Economic Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Governor J. Soedradjad
Djiwandono of Bank Indonesia (BI), the central bank, predicted the
country's economic growth would slow down next year but remain
above 7 percent, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on the country's economic prospects for
1997 held here Tuesday, he said next year's economic growth would
be similar to this year's, but slower than the 8.1 percent
expansion in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown would result from the tight fiscal and monetary
measures being undertaken now, he said.
</P>
<P>
The annual growth of narrowly-defined money supply began
slowing in June, to 27.5 percent in September, while domestic
liquidity growth declined to 26.1 percent and bank credit grew
19.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Soedradjad said the inflation rate also declined. It was 5.92
percent for the first 11 months of this year compared with the
7.85 percent for the corresponding 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
"All these trends show that Indonesia's economy this year will
slow down a little, but will stay above 7 percent," he said.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Tops PC Sales in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Compaq, a leading computer
company in the United States, became the top personal computer
seller on the Chinese market in the first quater of this year,
"China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion was based on a survey conduced by the
International Digital Corp.
</P>
<P>
Intense competition from Chinese manufacturers that have
launched several price wars to win consumer interest, did not
upset Compaq's strategy, which focuses on quality and after-sales
service, said a Compaq official.
</P>
<P>
During the January-September period, sales of Compaq PCs and
servers in China reached 229 million US dollars, about 10 percent
of the country's total PC sales.
</P>
<P>
For China-based PC companies such as Legend Group, Great Wall
and Beijing Beida Founder Corp, Compaq is one of the major foreign
competitors in the marketplace. Other foreign business rivals in
the PC sector now include IBM and AST.
</P>
<P>
To win an upper hand in the battle with foreign competitors,
Chinese PC firms have cut the retail prices of their pentium-based
computers to about 10,000 yuan on the average.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies, however, acknowledge that competing with
Chinese brands on a price basis is not a good idea, since foreign
brands face tariffs and other taxes, said a Compaq official.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Electronics Industry predicts that this year PC
sales are expected to surpass two million units, an estimated
increase of 500,000 units from last year.

WARSAW, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Automakers, insurers and law
enforcers from 30 countries gathered in Warsaw on Monday to find
ways to fight car theft, a booming business for international
crime gangs which costs billions of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, which was sponsored by the United Nations,
discussed how to fight slick thieves who spirited vehicles across
frontiers more easily than official agencies could cooperate to
trace and retrieve them.
</P>
<P>
Delegates all stressed the need for cooperation between
government agencies, the experienced sleuths of the insurance
industry and manufacturers who stamped identity numbers on
vehicles and were evolving ever-better security devices.
</P>
<P>
They also sought a quick, effective exchange of information
between countries, and clear procedures for returning stolen
vehicles found in other countries.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Provide Loan to Vitalize Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian National Foundation
for Agriculture Tuesday announced that it will give out a loan of
4 billion lev (some 16 million U.S. dollars) to promote
agricultural production in the coming winter and next spring.
</P>
<P>
Half of the loan will be used to transform and develop the
agricultural structure while the other half will go to purchase of
farming machines and tools to develop animal husbandry and crops
planting, said the foundation.
</P>
<P>
In order to encourage farming communes and individual farmers
to draw the loan, two commercial banks in charge of the loan have
decided to lower interest rate to 36 percent by cutting more than
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Local media attributed the loan to a shortfall in agricultural
output this year.
</P>
<P>
The wheat-growing area has decreased with wheat output hitting
the lowerest point last summer in the past 10 years, leading to a
food crisis, short supply of forage crops and serious recession in
animal husbandry.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sino-Pakistani Friendship an All-Weather One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAHORE, Pakistan, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A friend in need is a
friend indeed.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Pakistan claim each other to be friends who are
willing and prepared to help the other.
</P>
<P>
And both claim their relationship can serve as a model of
inter-state relations which are based on accepted principles,
mutual interests, and common goals of peace and development.
</P>
<P>
As banners and streamers along and over main Islamabad and
Lahore streets put it, Pak-China friendship is an all-weather one.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin described the
Sino-Pakistani ties as having "withstood the test of international
vicissitudes and enjoyed an all-round growth over the past 45
years" since the two countries established diplomatic relations in
1951.
</P>
<P>
He made this remark while addressing the country's senators on
Tuesday at the parliament house in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
"China and Pakistan enjoy a profound friendship dating back to
ancient times," Jiang said. "Our two peoples have regarded each
other as friends in need and brothers bound by common fate, always
sympathizing with and supporting each other."
</P>
<P>
He added the Chinese government and people are ready to join
their counterparts in further solidifying and strengthening the
friendly and cooperative relations.
</P>
<P>
Friendship proved overwhelming as Jiang materialized his
scheduled state visit even after the Pakistani government
underwent a reshuffle as President Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari
dismissed Benazir Bhutto from the post of prime minister on
November 5.
</P>
<P>
During his meetings with the Pakistani president, Caretaker
Prime Minister Malik Miraj Khalid and Punjab Province Governor
Khawaja Ahmed Tariq Rahim, Jiang compared notes with them on
issues of common concern as well as emphasizing bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Though his four-day visit was packed with meetings and
discussions and sightseeing tours in two cities, Jiang found a
whole evening to reunite with 11 old friends whom he had worked
with 20 years ago in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He hosted late on Tuesday in his makeshift home at the
Pakistani presidential residence in Islamabad a family-style
dinner of four courses and a soup, the composition of a typical
Chinese dinner.
</P>
<P>
President Leghari, on his part, offered Jiang a ride on his own
special plane and accompanied the Chinese visitor to Lahore, where
he saw him off to conclude his friendship ritual of
airport-to-airport accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani president said relations between the two
countries are not confined to government-to-government ones.
"They are relations that are now firmly rooted, in mutual trust
and respect and in the hearts of our respective peoples," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistanis demonstrated their hospitality to the Chinese
visitor as hundreds of students, folk dancers and musicians
gathered around main crossroads to greet Jiang in both Islamabad
and Lahore while more than 1,000 people availed themselves on a
workday afternoon in Lahore to attend a civic reception given in
honor of the Chinese president.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told Lahore citizens at the reception that the Chinese
visitors have been immersed in the joyous atmosphere of
Sino-Pakistani friendship since they landed in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Pakistani friendship is fortified by deeds.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have been cooperating closely in such fields
as politics, military affairs, economy, industry, culture and
education and the Chinese president cited as proof of the friendly
cooperation between the two countries a few projects such as the
Taxila Heavy Mechanical Complex, Karakoram Highway, Saindak
Copper-Gold Mines and Chashma Nuclear Power Plant.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Hike Again in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The prices of petroleum products
in the Philippines hiked again by 50 centavos (1.9 US cents) per
liter today.
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth increase since the Philippine government
began to implement in August the oil industry deregulation law,
which allows a monthly adjustment of oil prices on the basis of
the Singapore Posted Prices Index.
</P>
<P>
The products covered by the hike include premium gasoline,
regular gasoline and diesel, the most widely used fuel for public
transport in the country.
</P>
<P>
A liter of premium gasoline will now cost 10.76 pesos (41 US
cents) while regular gasoline and diesel are selling at 9.49 pesos
(36 US cents) and 8.07 pesos (30 US cents) per liter respectively.
</P>
<P>
But that is not the end. Bayani Faylona, chairman of the
Philippine Energy Regulatory Board, said another round of
50-centavo increase will be made before the 15th day of the month.
</P>
<P>
This is because the current round of prices adjustment was
delayed by the country's hosting of the informal leadership
conference of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum,
Faylona said.

BUENOS AIRES, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Pottery from a
pre-Hispanic civilization has been found in recent days in the
province of Catamarca in northwestern Argentina, a local official
said today.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Nazar, director of the provincial Museum of
Anthropology, said the pottery was approximately 1,500 years old
and belonged to the "La Aguada" civilization.
</P>
<P>
The remains were found next to the historical church and museum
of Santa Barbara in Pomancillo, about 20 kilometers from the city
of Catamarca.
</P>
<P>
During a thorough excavation there, experts found pots and
other elements for daily use, all with characteristics of the
agricultural-pottery-making period of the "La Aguada"
civilization. Several pots were in perfect condition.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe the spot was a garbage dump for an ancient
indigenous settlement, which proved the presence of a
pre-Hispanic culture in the area, said Nazar.

<P>
MANILA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A soldier and two civilians were
killed Tuesday morning in a heavy fighting between government
troops and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) guerrillas in the
southern Philippines, according to the military.
</P>
<P>
The military said the Moro rebels attacked the Army's 32nd
Infantry Brigade in Sirawai town in Zamboanga del Norte province
when it was conducting an operation. The two civilians were the
brigade's guides in the operation.
</P>
<P>
The attack Tuesday was the third in six days staged by MILF
fighters on the government troops in the province.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, MILF rebels killed a security officer in a second
attack at a logging camp in Sirawai town and then shot dead four
soldiers of the 32nd Infantry Battalion sent to the camp in an
ambush.
</P>
<P>
On November 28, rebels killed two camp guards and wounded five
others. Another guard was taken hostage to prevent soldiers from
capturing the retreating rebels.
</P>
<P>
Police say the rebels are demanding money from the logging
company in exchange for continued peaceful operations.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the renewed fighting will further postpone
the exploratory peace talks between the government and the MILF.
The planned peace talks have been delayed by the MILF for several
times after the government refused to stop offensive against its
bases on Basilan Island and withdraw troops from the MILF-claimed
areas.

<P>
NANNING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province, one of the
most developed areas in Chinna, has pledged to help free
neighboring Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region from poverty.
</P>
<P>
Xie Fei, secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), made the pledge during his visit
to Guangxi November 26-29.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong and Guangxi have been paired by the central

</P>
<P>
Guangdong, which also has underdeveloped areas of its own, is
experienced in dealing with poverty eradication, and the two
provinces can learn from each other in this respect, according to
Xie.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 provincial and local governments in Guangdong will
provide 60 million yuan gratis to Baise and Hechi prefectures in
Guangxi for the resettlement of poor people.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong will also employ more laborers from Guangxi and help
its neighbor train local cadres.
</P>
<P>
The two provinces will encourage local enterprises to conduct
more economic exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Guangdong side said that it favors the idea of
holding a Guangxi investment invitation fair in Guangzhou,

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Invests Heavily in Cotton Cultivation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region in Northwest China has stepped up its efforts to build
more local cotton production bases.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year Xinjiang will have invested 1.2 billion
yuan reclaiming over 80,000 ha of wasteland for the planting of
cotton and turning over 98,000 ha of low-yield cotton fields into
high-yield ones.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000) the
autonomous region will invest a total of 9.4 billion yuan in
cotton production, cultivating some 333,333 ha of wasteland and
upgrading 400,000 ha of low-yield lands.
</P>
<P>
By 2000 Xinjiang is expected to turn out 1.5 billion kg of
cotton. The project will cover 51 counties and cities in 10
prefectures, as well as 116 farms under the Xinjiang Production and
Construction Corps.
</P>
<P>
To reach the goal Xinjiang has formulated a series of
preferential policies to encourage local cotton-growers, and the
price of cotton has been increased by 30 yuan per 50 kg.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has also allocated 400 million yuan as
special funds for water control and nearly 10,000 km of new
irrigation canals have been dug.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, funds have also been provided by the regional
government to launch cotton-seed breeding projects, and build
weather-forecasting facilities, and farm machinery and other
related service networks.

BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- China will set up a pilot
digital microwave network in Shandong Province to speed up
digitalization of its long-distance telecoms.
</P>
<P>
According to "People's Posts and Telecommunications News", a
high-capacity SDH (synchronous digital hierarchy) microwave
network will connect Yutai and Sishui, via Jining City.
</P>
<P>
The network is being developed by the No. 4 Research Institute

and can provide a transmission speed of 155 Mb/s, the highest for
its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
In addition to testing the feasibility of domestic
SDH microwave equipment, the network will accelerate the
commercialization of microwave transmission technology in
China, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bars 16 Japanese War Crime Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Justice department took
its first action on Tuesday to bar 16 Japanese army veterans,
suspected of criminal experiments during the World War II, from
entering the United States.
</P>
<P>
the 16 men who served in the Japanese Imperial Army were the
first Japanese placed on the government's "watch list" since it
was established in 1979 to keep out people who engaged in
persecution on behalf of Nazi Germany or its allies, the Justice
Department said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It said some of the 16 men had been members of "Unit 731" that
conducted frequently lethal pseudo-medical experiments on
thousands of prisoners of war and civilians.
</P>
<P>
The others are suspected of setting up and operating the
Imperial Army's "comfort women stations", where hundreds of
thousands of women were forced to have sexual relations with
Japanese officers and enlisted men.
</P>
<P>
Eli M. Rosenbaum, director of Justice's Office of Special
Investigations, which hunts war criminals, said he expected that
more former members of the Japanese armed forces will be barred.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department declined to release the names of the
barred Japanese men, and spokesman John Russell said that
withholding these names may serve as "a deterrent to entry by
others not yet listed."
</P>
<P>
More than 60,000 people linked to Nazi persecution in Europe
have been put on the "watch list" since it was established in
1979, and more than 100 people prevented from entering the United
States since 1989, when record-keeping began.
</P>
<P>
And Rosenhaum's investigation office has stripped 57 people
accused of being Nazi persecutors of their U.S. citizenship and 48
of them expelled since 1979. There are still more than 300 under
investigation by his unit.
</P>
<P>
But it was the first action the United States took against
the Japanese army veterans serving the Imperial Army during the
World War II.

NEW YORK, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average plummeted 79.01 to 6,442.69 today, the worst loss since
its July sell-off after a late wave of profit-taking on last
month's blue-chip rally.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a slim margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume reaching 515.65 million
shares, up from 412.48 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.28 to 748.28. The
NYSE's composite index fell 3.29 to 394.85 after making its first
move above 400.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 0.55 to 1,300.37, its first
foray above the 1,300-mark.
</P>
<P>
The American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 0.75 to
592.18.
</P>
<P>
The Dow surrendered a 33-point morning gain that briefly put
the blue-chip barometer into record territory.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices rose in the morning, the yield on the 30-year
Treasury bond fell as low as 6.31 percent from late Monday's 6.36
percent. But as bonds retreated this afternoon, the yield rose to
6.35 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board research group reported this morning that
its Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose just 0.1 percent in
October. The Commerce Department, meanwhile, reported that new
home sales plunged a surprising 8.7 percent in October to the
lowest level in seven months.
</P>
<P>
The data helped counter Monday's worries about reports of brisk
holiday sales and a big increase in U.S. manufacturing last
month.

The French Communist Party National Secretary Robert Hue said
he condemned with the greatest indignation "this new act of
terrorism," which he described as "a cowardly attack."
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party First Secretary Lionel Jospin said that
such terrorist acts must be repelled. The number two of the
Socialist Party and Paris deputy, Daniel Vaillant, said that the
men responsible for the attack must be subdued.
</P>
<P>
Bernard Kouchner, spokesman of the Radical Socialist Party,
said that the terrorists were targeting the whole people of France
by launching such an attack. He also called on the French people
not to be overcome by the feeling of fear and intolerance.
</P>

Jean-Marie Lustiger, the Paris Cardinal Archbishop of the Roman
Catholic Church, called on people not to yield to a feeling of
hatred which the terrorists wanted to spread.

<HEADLINE> Canada Urges Yugoslav Government to Show Restraint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Canada today expressed deep
concern over developments in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(FRY) and urged its government to show restraint.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned that the government of FRY has chosen to
ignore accepted international norms for conducting democratic
elections and that opposition candidates in major cities have been
deprived of their rightful places on local councils," said
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
Canada has followed closely the protests and demonstrations in
the FRY since the government's decision to annul the results of
the second round of local elections, said Axworthy, who is
currently traveling in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Canada's ambassador in Belgrade warned the FRY government that
failure to adhere to internationally accepted democratic standards
would have a negative effect on the normalization of relations
between Canada and the FRY, he said.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy also expressed concern over Sunday's announcement by
the President of the FRY Federal Parliament, implying the possible
use of force in dealing with peaceful demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
The decision today by the FRY to close down a key independent
radio station in Belgrade is a further regressive step, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy said he would discuss the evolving situation with
colleagues participating at the Peace Implementation Conference in
London.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Party Confirms Victory in Serbian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Socialist Party of
Serbia (SPS) confirmed its victory in local elections on Tuesday,
saying its coalition had won 151 out of 189 municipal districts in
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
SPS Spokesman Ivica Dacic said at a press conference that
repeated voting in a small number of electoral districts cannot
change the overall results and the victory of the left coalition
in both federal and local elections.
</P>
<P>
On November 3, the leftist coalition, comprised of SPS,
Yugoslav Left (JUL) and New Democracy (ND), had won 64 out of 108
Serbia's seats in the lower house of Yugoslav parliament.
</P>
<P>
Dacic said out of the total 7,645 seats in local councils in
Serbia, the leftist coalition and independent candidates won
nearly 5,000 seats, or over 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
The opposition coalition Zajedno (Together) has gained 1,751
seats, or 22.9 percent, and Serbian Radical Party only 308, or
four percent, Dacic added.
</P>
<P>
But Zajedno claimed it had won a majority in the local
elections in the second round of voting on November 17. Zajedno
organized daily demonstrations in Belgrade over the past two weeks
to protest against the court ruling which annulled part of the
results in the run-offs.
</P>
<P>
Due to various errors and irregularities, local elections were
repeated in only 352 polling stations out of the total of 10,076
for 298 seats out of the total of 7,645, Dacis explained, adding
that elections were declared completely null only in the Belgrade
district of Savski Venac, where elections will be repeated.
</P>
<P>
Referring to opposition protest rallies in Belgrade and some
other towns in Serbia, Dacic said the "destructive and violent
nature of the demonstrations was almost the only recognizable
characteristic of the policy of those parties and their leaders
since 1990."
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Belgraders took to the street again on
Tuesday, marching through the city center. The opposition leaders
said they would continue their protest rallies until the
government backed down.
</P>
<P>
Serbian police have arrested 32 protesters for violating laws
during their protest and said they would not tolerate any more the
demonstrations that lasted over the past two weeks, causing
economic losses and jamming traffic in downtown.
</P>
<P>
But some Western countries have warned Serbian leaders to
refrain from using force to crack down the demonstrations or they
would reimpose economic sanctions against Serbia.

<HEADLINE> Canadian-led Team Discovers Stem Cells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian-led team has finally
identified the elusive parent of all blood cells thanks to
laboratory mice with human immune systems.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of stem cells opens the way to more effective
gene therapy for blood diseases, said team head Dr. John Dick of
Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children.
</P>
<P>
"By pinpointing stem cells, we can test how they can go wrong
and find a way to target them," Dick was quoted as saying by
today's Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Although stem cells are one in a million in the bone marrow,
they are the creators of cells that make all the types of blood
cells, including the immune defenses.
</P>
<P>
Correcting a bad gene in a stem cell would multiply the
correction and pass it along to all future generations of cells,
Dr. Dick explained.
</P>
<P>
The team's finding could lead to more effective gene therapy
for inherited blood diseases such as leukemia, thallassemia and
sickle cell anemia.
</P>
<P>
It will also be important in chemotherapy for tumours anywhere
in the body, Dr. Dick said.
</P>
<P>
Though stem cells are known to exist for years, they look like
other cells, and there was no way of identifying them.
</P>
<P>
Attempts at gene therapy have had to aim at millions of cells,
hoping to affect enough stem cells in the process to make the
change permanent.
</P>
<P>
The team found stem cells by watching which cells created blood
and immune functions in a strain of laboratory mice specially bred
to be born without an immune system.
</P>
<P>
Stem cells have identifying features that include a surface
structure know as CD38. By using an antibody that attaches to that
structure, they can now be easily identified, Dr. Dick added.

<HEADLINE> Tudjman Visits Eastern Slavonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, December 3 (Xinhua) - Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman on Tuesday visited Eastern Slavonia, a region which was
once seized by rebel Serbs but is now being phased into Croatia.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Tudjman and other senior Croatian officials
toured Vukovar, the regional capital which was devastated during
the war with the Serbs and two villages where Croat refugees would
return before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian Serbs took control of Eastern Slavonia and formed
their own state when Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia
in June 1991. In the following war, thousands of Croats were
killed and many more were driven out of the region.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the Croatian government and the Serbs reached an
agreement under which the region would be reintegrated into
Croatia after a maximum two year transitional period under a UN
administration.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with UN Administrator American General
Jacques Klein, Tudjman said in a statement that his visit "is a
sign and proof that the peaceful reintegration of the Croatian
Danubian area into the constitutional and legal system of the
Republic of Croatia is on the right path and progressing well."
</P>
<P>
Tudjman also held talks with local Serb representatives, who
had previously indicated to accept Croatia as their homeland but
also demanded for more minority rights for the Serb population.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, the Croatian customs offices were
re-established along the border between the Eastern Slavonian
region and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Re-Elect Lott Senate Majority Leader, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Republicans
re-elected Trent Lott Tuesday their majority leader for the next
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after being unanimously chosen as majority leader, Lott
told reporters that the Republican Party and Clinton could work
together on balancing the budget, cutting taxes and other issues.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to working with the president to get
legislative achievements signed into law," Lott said.
</P>
<P>
But Lott also said the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
would hold hearings on allegations of illegal fund-raising by
Democrats during the recent campaign.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno's decision to not appoint a special
prosecutor to investigate the charges makes a Senate investigation
"even a greater necessity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle was re-elected
today leader without opposition. He said Democrats would make
campaign finance legislation their top priority next year. He said
Democrats would support hearings into alleged fund-raising abuses
if they are "broad-based" and included Republican infractions,
which he refused to describe.
</P>
<P>
Lott, 55, replaced Bob Dole as Republican leader last June,
when Dole resigned to concentrate on his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
Daschle, turning 49 next Monday, will begin his third year in
the job.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans' 53-47 Senate majority has expanded to 55-45 in
the new 105th Congress.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles retained his position today,
while Connie Mack was chosen for the No. 3 job of conference
chairman.
</P>
<P>
Also re-elected for the Democrats were Senators Wendell Ford of
Kentucky, the whip, and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, who is
conference secretary.

<HEADLINE> U.S. MCI, British Telecom Apply for $20.8 Bln Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- British Telecom and MCI
requested U.S. federal regulators Tuesday to give green light to
their planned 20.8 billion U.S. dollars merger, which would be the
biggest-ever foreign takeover of a U.S. company.
</P>
<P>
The two telecommunication giants filed the proposal with the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) today, starting the
requirement process in which consumers and competitors will be
given a chance to comment. The FCC could make a decision within
six months.
</P>
<P>
The planned merger also must be approved by the U.S. Justice
Department, more than 30 state regulatory commissions, British
regulators and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
British Telecommunications is the largest telephone company in
Britain. MCI Communications is the second-largest long-distance
company in this country after AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
The two companies announced agreement November 3 to create a
combined company called Concert to provide communications services
worldwide. The deal would create a company with annual revenue of
42 billion dollars and 43 million business and residential
customers in 72 countries.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T and other rivals contend the merger would hurt competition
and reduce customer choice.

<HEADLINE> UN: 133 Million Dollars Needed for Humanitarian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations said here
today that 133 million US dollars are needed for humanitarian aid
to war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The UN appeal, which has been prepared in consultation with UN
agencies, non-governmental organizations and the donor community,
will provide urgent humanitarian assistance and address the needs
for rehabilitation and reconstruction throughout Afghanistan,
according to the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA).
</P>
<P>
The DHA said that some 500,000 people in the Afghan capital of
Kabul alone will depend on food relief to survive this winter
while the eighteenth winter at war comes to Afghanistan.
Furthermore, the recent civil conflict has worsened the already
difficult living conditions in the country that has the highest
rates of infant, childhood and maternal mortality in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The DHA called on the international community to respond
generously to the appeal to relieve the suffering of the Afghan
people and to provide a basis for longer-term rehabilitation and
reconstruction of the country with nearly 10 million landmines
constantly causing death and disability.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Clock Exhibition Opens at UN Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- An "AIDS clock", which
ticks off a new HIV/AIDS infection case every 12 seconds in the
world, is on display at the UN headquarters from today through
December 22.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the exhibit is how to prevent the spread of the
HIV infection which leads to AIDS. The display stresses
responsible sexual behavior as a means of preventing HIV
transmission, but it reminds viewers of the need to care for
people living with HIV/AIDS, comfort the bereaved, work for
prevention and seek a cure.
</P>
<P>
It also points out that low-income countries are among the
hardest hit by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and the least able to cope
with the ravages.
</P>
<P>
They need assistance to provide information and advice on
prevention, as well as care and treatment, the display stressed.
</P>
<P>
UN latest statistics show that there are 22.6 million HIV/AIDS
cases throughout the world and nearly two thirds of them live in
the sub-Sahara Africa.
</P>
<P>
Both UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and President
of UN General Assembly Razali Ismail called on controlling spread
of HIV/AIDS in developing countries on Monday when delivering
messages on the occasion of the World AIDS Day.

<HEADLINE> Irish President on Humanitarian Crisis Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Irish president Mary Robinson
said here today that the world had to learn the lessons of Bosnia
and Rwanda and develop new institutions capable of resolving such
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gathering of the London English Speaking Union
this evening, President Robinson said that "complex political
crises can not be resolved by short-term humanitarian responses
alone."
</P>
<P>
"International humanitarian aid in itself alone is not the
solution to the problems of the people of Rwanda or other crisis
areas and may simply postpone the problem so that it recurs," she
said.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the refugees camps established in eastern
Zaire and Tanzania were a response but not a solution, adding "the
camps represented a paralysis of any dynamic towards a true
settlement."
</P>
<P>
She expressed her convictions to build powerful international
institutions to shoulder the task of crisis prevention and
management.
</P>
<P>
President Robinson, who arrived here on Monday for a three-day
visit, received an honorary doctorate from the Coventry University
earlier today.

<HEADLINE> French Army Put on Alert after Terrorist Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The French Army in the Paris
region has been put on alert to help police and paramilitary
police carry out the "Vigipirate Operation" in hunting down the
terrorists who blew up a Paris train this evening.
</P>
<P>
The chief of staff of the Paris Military Region have been
ordered by the army headquarters to respond to all requests any
time to participate in the anti-terrorist operation, the Agence
France Presse (AFP) quoted military sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
General Michel Billot, Military Commander of the Paris Region,
or l'Ile-de-France, is reportedly following the situation very
closely.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 1,000 elite mobile paramilitary police, the CRS, are
being dispatched to Paris to guard all strategic positions and all
railway stations, in a reinforcement of the Paris police force.
</P>
<P>
Police will intensify patrol in the streets of the capital, and
will interview anyone they think can help them find the attacker.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre was chairing an emergency
session of security officers tonight, which was joined by General
Yves Capdepont, number two of the national paramilitary police,
the Gendarmerie.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted police as saying that the gas demijohn bomb, the
type frequently used by Algerian Islamic extremists, was placed on
the fourth car of the eight-car RER train, which served Paris and
its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-eight people were hospitalized after being wounded by
the explosion, among whom several were in a desperate situation,
according to hospital sources.
</P>
<P>
Two people were killed instantly by the powerful bomb
explosion, which took place at 1803 (1603GMT) when the train was
entering the platform of a RER station near Luxembourg Park in
downtown Paris.

<HEADLINE> Algerian Islamic Extremists First Suspect in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Algeria's Islamic extremists
becamed the first suspect in this evening's bomb attack on a Paris
underground train, the RER, in which two people were killed and
many wounded, some of them very gravely.
</P>
<P>
Police have found the debris of a 13-kilogram gas demijohn, a
type of bomb engine which was widely used by the Algerian
extremists in their terrorist attacks at home, and was used in the
attack on a subway train in downtown Paris in July last year.
</P>
<P>
The French government has immediately revived the "Vilipirate
Operation" they launched after the bomb attack on the
Saint-Michel subway station in central Paris, which killed eight
people and wounded 159 in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
Algeria's diehard group of Armed Islamic Group claimed
responsibility for last year's attack on the Paris subway train,
but the terrorists who placed the bomb are still at large now.
</P>
<P>
Although the Corsican separatists have also been launching
attacks on government targets for several months, they never
target people, and regard material damages as rough enough.
</P>
<P>
However, the Algerian Islamic extremists are widely known to be
a group of killers who never hesitate to target innocent civilians
as their victims at home.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that the bomb explosion was so powerful that a
whole district where the RER station was located was shocked.
</P>
<P>
The bomb blew up when the train was still running in the tunnel
before stopping at platform of the station Port Royal near
Luxembourg Park, and a whole car was completely reduced to debris
with parts of human bodies flying all around after the bomb
exploded, said witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Police and firefighters rushed to the scene within two minutes
to put down a big fire from the explosion and rescue the victims.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Renews Call for Demilitarization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides today renewed his call for demilitarization of his
country.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot president made the appeal at the summit of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which
is currently underway in Lisbon, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Clerides reiterated his proposal for the demilitarization
of Cyprus which "would go a long way towards diffusing a constant
threat not only to the security of Cyprus but also to the
stability in the region".
</P>
<P>
The president sent a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali in December 1993, proposing the withdrawal
of foreign troops and settlers, the disbanding of the military
forces and the positioning of a multinational force on the island.
</P>
<P>
"It is my belief that the OSCE can promote this proposal
and that it can play an important role in overseeing its
implementation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus "earnestly expects some mechanism for joint OSCE
action in cases of non-compliance with the Helsinki Declaration
of Principles by a member-state", Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
He also backed closer cooperation between the OSCE and other
organizations, such as the Council of Europe, and reaffirmed his
government's commitment to developing further dialogue with its
Mediterranean partners for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In another development, President of the House of
Representatives Spyros Kyprianou recently has demanded to send
packing the two British bases in southern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
After years of struggle against British colonial rule, Cyprus
gained independence in 1960. But under the 1960 Treaty, Britain
retained two military bases on Cyprus' southern coast and other
facilities in various parts of this East Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops landed
and seized 37 percent of the island following an Athens-backed
coup.
</P>
<P>
Repeated UN efforts to reunite the island into a bizonal and
bicommunal federal state have failed to yield any concrete
results.
</P>
<P>
The EU ministerial council decided on March 6, 1995 to
start accession negotiations with Cyprus six months after the
conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference.
</P>
<P>
However, some EU countries insist that an internal settlement
should be reached before the island joins the EU.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Not to Discuss Ties With Taiwan: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 3 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
does not intend to reopen discussions on South Africa's relations
with Taiwan when meeting Taiwanese "Foreign Minister" John Chang
tomorrow, presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said today.
</P>
<P>
Chang arrived here today for talks with South African
officials. He had advanced his trip, originally scheduled for
January, after Mandela's announcement last week that South Africa
will cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan before the end of 1997, and
establish full diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
Mandela will meet Chang in Pretoria tomorrow, Mankahlana told
the South African Press Association (SAPA).
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said: "South Africa wishes to maintain contact
with Taiwan at a level sufficient to facilitate trade, cultural
and other relations."
</P>
<P>
"The decision to establish diplomatic ties with the People's
Republic of China had not been taken lightly," he said, adding:
"It was the result of much consideration and investigation on the
course South Africa should follow."
</P>
<P>
Mandela announced on November 27 that his country's diplomatic
ties with Taiwan will be severed by the end of December 1997, and
other ties with Taiwan will remain intact.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa has become an active participant within
the ambit of the Organization of African Unity and the
Non-Aligned Movement, as well as the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his country's continuation of diplomatic
recognition of Taiwan is "inconsistent with South Africa's role
in international affairs".

LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Major European stock markets all
surged sharply on Tuesday, with German shares ending at the fourth
record close running and the Paris bourse setting a new high for
the year.
</P>
<P>
The London market rallied strongly and recovered Monday's
losses today, taking its initial momentum from a steady overnight
performance on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that concerns about an interest rates rise and the
rising value of the pound failed to prevent the FTSE 100 index
from ending 23 points higher at 4,061.5.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, share prices climbed higher and set a new record
close, with the DAX-30 share index up 28.38 points at 2,886.98,
helped by buoyant government bonds and the soaring dollar.
</P>
<P>
French shares in Paris surged to their highest level this year
and were 30.48 points up at 2,349.11 at the end of the session,
boosted by a stronger dollar and rising expectations of possible
interest rate cuts in Europe.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 leading British shares closed up 23 points at

at 2,886.98.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Rejects Proposed Ban on Greek Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides said today that he would not commit himself now to a ban
on flights of Greek military aircraft over Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Clerides made the statement following a U.S. proposal that
flights of Greek and Turkish warplanes over Cyprus are suspended
for a period of 12 months, according to Cyprus state radio.
</P>
<P>
Carey Cavanaugh, Director of Southern European Affairs at the
U.S. State Department made the proposal to Cyprus Foreign
Minister Alecos Michaelides and the Turkish delegation that is in
Lisbon, Portugal, for the summit of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
The president was quoted as telling the U.S. official that
nothing has been agreed on the U.S. proposal.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government, Clerides noted, lays special emphasis
on efforts to settle the Cyprus problem, the start of substantive
consultations to find common ground and also on direct talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus would welcome any ideas concerning decreasing tension
and would cooperate toward this goal, he added.
</P>
<P>
Clerides stressed that a joint defense principle with Greece
will continue to be strengthened and plans for the construction of
an air base in Cyprus would go ahead.
</P>
<P>
In remarks on the same issue, House President Spyros Kyprianou
said that Cyprus has no obligation to end flights of Greek
aircraft over Cyprus. "Our position is that Greek aircraft fly
over Cyprus legally, with the permission of the government."
</P>
<P>
"But flights by Turkish aircraft over Cyprus are illegal and
contradict international law since they have no permission from
Cyprus," Kyprianou, who is also Cyprus' acting president, told
reporters here today.
</P>
<P>
"If substantive talks begin early next year, the government
would be ready to listen to suggestions about issues relating
to the reduction of tension," he added.
</P>
<P>
Greek and Turkish warplanes have recently taken part in the
military exercises staged by both sides, escalating tension on
this Eastern Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
So far, no comments have been reported on the U.S. proposal by
the Turkish Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and seized the northern third of the island following
a short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.
