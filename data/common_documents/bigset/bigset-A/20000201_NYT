AMERICA ONE'S TACTICS CLOSE THE GAP ON PRADA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ With its bright hopes of challenging for
the America's Cup beginning to dim, Paul Cayard's America One
syndicate sailed a strong, confident race on Tuesday and scored a
wire-to-wire victory over Italy's Prada Challenge in the fifth race
of the five-of-nine-race Louis Vuitton Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   Prada still maintains a 3-2 edge in the series to determine Team
New Zealand's opponent in the America's Cup. That series will begin
on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the hardest one to win of the four we've got
to win,'' Cayard said. ``Tomorrow will be a good one. We'll get it
to 3-3 and then we'll see how the other guys like the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard, in need of a victory after two straight defeats, took
the action to his counterpart, Francesco de Angelis. First, Cayard
tried unsuccessfully to coerce Prada into a prestart foul and
hailed the race committee to protest the Italians _ but the umpires
waved the green checkered flag. All clear.
</P>
<P>
   But he was not through. With about a minute to go to the
starting gun, Cayard peeled out beyond the committee boat, but
Prada, in control and right on his tail, had him seemingly pinned
from escape.
</P>
<P>
   Holding port tack and with the seconds ticking, Cayard needed to
flop over to starboard to gain steerage rights and make his move
for the line. He needed, however, to create enough separation to
avoid being called for an infraction for tacking too close.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard's timing was perfect, and he slashed inside of Prada. The
Italians screamed foul _ America One had left no room to spare _
but the umpires judged that it was a clean maneuver. The Americans
slipped behind the committee boat with Prada just astern to take
the start by seven seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It was a perfect start. The Italians' view of the Americans'
stern would not change for the remainder of the contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we realized in this series is we haven't quite had the
zip we had in the semifinals,'' Cayard said after the victory.
``We've just been trying to get it back in the groove.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly in the afterguard on America One with that kind of
start, and those shifts that John picked for us on the first beat,
that kind of a lead at the top mark is awesome, so that was good,''
he added, referring to America One's tactician, John Kostecki.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans sailed a brilliant first leg, hitting each shift
as the southwest wind puffed up to 21 knots and eventually opening
up a seven-boat-length advantage. America One's lead at the top
mark was 32 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Prada was conceding nothing at all. Both boats hoisted
conventional spinnakers as the breeze began to fluctuate, bellowing
up and down from 15 to 19 knots. Now it was the Italians' turn to
hit a crucial shift or two.
</P>
<P>
   Showing good pace off the wind, and finding the better pressure
pulsing down the whitecap-flecked Hauraki Gulf, Prada began to reel
back major chunks of waterborne real estate, rounding the bottom
mark a mere 10 seconds behind America One.
</P>
<P>
   Prada immediately tacked to the right, and Cayard had no choice
but to follow to defend his lead. He could not risk having the
Italians find better wind or a favorable shift.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians seemed to be sailing a hair closer to the wind, an
advantage Cayard noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little down for some reason,'' he said. But Kostecki
was on top of his game and ultimately forced Prada past the layline
for the windward mark _adding a short but critical extra margin to
the distance Prada would have to sail.
</P>
<P>
   Squeezing around the mark, America One held an 18-second lead
with half of the 18.5-mile-long course behind it.
</P>
<P>
   But a pattern was emerging. If America One showed a bit more
speed upwind, it was all Prada when the boats creamed downwind
under spinnaker.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Italians picked an extremely bad moment to make a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   It was a beauty.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of their own jibe, with the pressure from the fresh
puff too much for their overtrimmed sails, the Italians broached
and skidded out of control. When their spinnaker collapsed and
sailed skyward in the midst of the sensational wipeout, America One
pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard and his crew did nothing dramatic, holding to
conservative tactics to record their second crucial victory by a
final margin of 34 seconds.  &QL;

GRIEVING FAMILIES AWAIT WORD OF LOVED ONES ABOARD FLIGHT 261 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VANESSA HO  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ They were supposed to embrace loved ones stepping off
the plane, many of whom would probably be tan and happy after a
Mexican vacation in Puerto Vallarta.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they filled the airport here with grief upon learning
that Alaska Airlines Flight 261 had crashed into the Pacific Ocean
on Monday, about 20 miles off the California coast near Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines set up a private room with counselors and clergy
at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Monday night, for people
worried about the 83 passengers, two pilots and three flight
attendants aboard the flight. The crew was reported to be based
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us at Alaska Airlines have been shaken and deeply
saddened by the accident involving Flight 261 on January 31,
2000,'' said Alaska Airlines CEO John Kelly in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thoughts and our prayers at this moment are for our
passengers and fellow employees and for their families, friends and
loved ones. To all I extend my personal and profound sorrow for
what has transpired.''
</P>
<P>
   As a steady stream of frantic people rushed to Alaska Airline's
counter, they fought through throngs of TV cameras, before Alaska
employees escorted them into a private ``family room'' on the
mezzanine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my sister is on that flight,'' said a man at the
counter. Other people came in holding hands and holding back tears.
</P>
<P>
   One young woman, crying hysterically, said her mother is a
Seattle-based Alaska Airlines attendant who was on a flight in
Mexico on Monday. But she did not know which flight.
</P>
<P>
   As she and her boyfriend walked up to the private room, a
photographer snapped her picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear, if you take one more picture of me, I'll sue you,''
the woman yelled. ``Somebody get her out of here. She has no right
to do this!''
</P>
<P>
   In the private room, a specially trained team of Alaska
employees provided care, support and food to the family members. It
set up hotline for family members, 1-800-553-5117.
</P>
<P>
   Lynnette Arnold and Jeff Peterson, both of Federal Way, Wash.,
were two of many religious people who arrived to provide support.
Arnold said she was at home when she heard the news on television.
She then called Peterson, who attends her church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just shocked,'' she said, while waiting by the
ticketing counter. ``The spirit of God came on and said get down to
the airport right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Maynard Sargent of the Salvation Army, a St. James Bible
in hand, also arrived to help. But his only participation visible
to reporters Monday night was the crush of TV cameras closing in on
him.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Alaska's other flights were delayed, but the airport _
other than the private grieving room _ appeared to be business as
usual. In one airport bar, the TV was trained on sports, not on the
news. Around 8 p.m., an aid crew went into the private room, but
the reason was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate, but it's not going to stop me from flying,''
said an airport employee. ``It's still safer to fly than drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska's Flight 237 _ carrying a girls' gymnastics team from
Auburn, Wash. _ also was arriving from Puerto Vallarta on Monday
night, causing additional confusion and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was freaking out,'' said Leigh Langlois, whose boyfriend was
on Flight 237. But when she discovered her boyfriend was okay, she
was still crying. ``I didn't know what to feel, I just felt like
crying,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Susan Chan, waiting for their two young daughters to
return from a gymnastics retreat in Puerto Vallarta, were relieved
to discover it was a different flight that crashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel for the families,'' Martin Chan said.
</P>
<P>
   At the San Francisco International Airport, a handful of
relatives were whisked away to a VIP lounge by airline officials.
Clergy were reported to be on the way to the airport to offer
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   While families waited here and in San Francisco, an armada of
boats circled through the rising swells and spreading oil near Los
Angeles, searching for signs of hope.
</P>
<P>
   P-I reporters Judd Slivka, Candy Hatcher, Tracy Johnson and Lisa
Stiffler contributed to this report.

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATLANTA _ Nobody mentioned the ``D'' word Monday morning. Not the
commissioner, Paul Tagliabue. Not the MVP, Kurt Warner. Not the
born-again coach, Dick Vermeil. Not even us curious media types,
who tend to dig for trends and tendencies where none exist.
</P>
<P>
   The world champion St. Louis Rams _ who could have imagined back
in August that series of words being hacked out on a thousand
laptops Sunday night? _ are relatively young and have only four
free agents to worry about re-signing. But nobody for a moment
suspects they have launched their bid to be the team of the, hmm,
what do we call the coming decade? The pre-teens?
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't matter. The Rams aren't going to dominate it. They
aren't going to be a Packers-Steelers-49ers-Cowboys-sized dynasty
by any stretch of the imagination. A far tougher schedule in 2001
will take a physical toll, and strategists will have all winter to
ferret out their deficiencies. Look at Atlanta's
rags-to-riches-to-rags script of 1997-99, and you may see St.
Louis' path next fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' 23-16 victory in Super Bowl XXXIV did, however,
initiate the NFL's new epoch, one that figures to follow a
different kind of model than the tidy, predictable packages of the
latter part of the 20th century. By all accounts, we are entering a
period that will be known mostly for random chaos. Shared revenues,
free agency and a hard salary cap have combined to eliminate the
league's traditional power structure.
</P>
<P>
   While baseball lives, barely, by the Golden Rule _ teams with
the most gold always rule _ look at our most recent NFL champs:
Green Bay, Denver and St. Louis. And this year's final four: the
Rams, the Titans, the Buccaneers and the Jaguars. Not a New York
Yankees in the bunch, is there?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a system that works for all our teams, no matter where
they are located or what size market they are in,'' Tagliabue said
at his annual state-of-the-league address Friday. ``To win the
Super Bowl is not simply a matter of who has the most money or who
is in the biggest city.''
</P>
<P>
   Or who has been around the longest, which is the best news of
all for Houston's fledgling football enterprise. Jacksonville, in
its fifth season, won more regular-season games _ 14 _ than anyone
else and, despite its obvious matchup shortcomings vs. the Titans,
could well be the franchise to beat next year. Or it might be any
of another half-dozen teams, Tennessee included.
</P>
<P>
   It's popular to mock the NFL's parity and rip the league for its
lack of a regal presence. But attendance is at an all-time high,
franchise values have risen like Internet stock prices, and TV
ratings, if not soaring, aren't crashing, either. Also, rather than
everyone finishing 8-8, the logical end result for a system
striving to attain total competitive equality, four teams won at
least 13 games in 1999, a historic first.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has become the great democracy's great democracy, a
classically classless (I'm referring to social structure here)
society that gleefully embraces its huddled masses in the huddle,
if not at the turnstile.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Warner ... only in America, and the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   A reformed control-freak/workaholic coach can reinvent himself
overnight at the age of 63 and win his first championship on behalf
of the league's only female owner. An African-American quarterback
from a tiny backwoods school in Dixie can lead his team to within
one yard of the first Super Bowl overtime. A small-college
bench-warmer turned night stocker in an Iowa grocery store turned
Arena League/NFL Europe nomad can throw for more yards than any
other Super Bowl quarterback in history.
</P>
<P>
   After Dick, Georgia (the owner, not the state), Kurt and the
Rams, anything is possible. Suddenly, Bob McNair's $700 million
entry fee into Club Tags looks like a not-unreasonable investment
in potential happiness, both his and ours. The NFL, in its current
free-for-all state, has become a haven for dreamers, for anyone
with the right mix of faith, vision, energy and wherewithal.
</P>
<P>
   Every kid on every sandlot today can see himself doing what
Warner did. His too-good-to-be-true story is that of Rudy and Rocky
and The Waterboy rolled into one real-life fairy tale. When Warner
met his wife, Brenda, an ex-Marine with a handicapped son, she was
on food stamps, and he was about to be between jobs. Now, next step
for them: a financial windfall and a mansion on the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Will success change Kurt? Probably, human nature being what it
is. But he still figures to be a solid, generous guy. And his
league, already the king of beasts in the sports jungle, stands to
prosper even more because people want to believe life can be like
the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, it appears we're getting back into the game at a very
opportune time. Thanks, Bob.

U.S. SENATE TO VOTE ON REWRITE OF BANKRUPTCY LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL WENSKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate is scheduled today to begin voting on the
biggest rewrite of the nation's bankruptcy laws in 22 years, but
the effort's effectiveness remains in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, pushed by the credit card lobby, creates a strict
``means test'' to measure a consumer's ability to repay creditors.
A similar bill passed the House last year.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, citing historically high rates of personal
bankruptcies, say changes are needed to make it tougher for
consumers to walk away from their commitments when they are able to
pay off their debts.
</P>
<P>
   Texas U.S. Circuit Judge Edith Jones told Congress reform is
necessary to rectify the ``problems of personal responsibility that
lie at the heart of many bankruptcies.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics question the vote's timing, coming as bankruptcy
rates are dipping and as credit card companies market aggressively
to riskier customers to boost their profits.
</P>
<P>
   Many law professors and bankruptcy judges argue the bill amounts
to a bail-out of an industry that is trying to squeeze the only
safety valve that exists for overwhelmed consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill has been bought and paid for by the credit
industry,'' said G. Ray Warner, a University of Missouri-Kansas
City law professor who has served on bankruptcy reform panels.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, beyond the politics of the debate, exists a larger concern
for consumers: No one really knows if the changes, which would
affect millions of Americans, will work.  &LR; brk:Making changes
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been little statistical gathering on bankruptcy,
except in the last few years,'' Warner said. ``The statistics are
very unreliable. It's like the blind men describing the elephant.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the bill's avid backers conceded in a 1998 paper
that whether the bill's assumptions are correct ``cannot be known
until it is implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill itself has come together like ``Frankenstein's
monster,'' said Overland Park bankruptcy attorney Robert Berger,
describing a patchwork of special interest concessions that include
protections for car dealers and penalties for abortion clinic
bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the General Accounting Office said it could validate
few of the bill's assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO said there is no agreement ``on the number of debtors
who seek relief through the bankrutpcy process who have the ability
to pay at least a portion of their debts.''
</P>
<P>
   Who can pay, and how much, is at the crux of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the National Consumer Bankruptcy Coalition, a business
alliance of banking and credit interests, launched an advertising
campaign claiming that a whopping 33 percent of consumers who file
for bankruptcy do so to skip out on debts they can pay.
</P>
<P>
   While most researchers discounted the coalition's claims, which
were accompanied by $1.6 million in political contributions, even
studies that were deemed more credible couldn't agree on means
testing.
</P>
<P>
   The test, meant to weed out wealthier debtors, would replace a
more discretionary test that looks at whether a debtor has
substantial ability to repay creditors.
</P>
<P>
   The new test, which applies IRS standards, asks three questions:
Does an individual or family make the median income? Would they
have $50 left each month after paying living expenses? And can they
repay 20 percent of their debts over the next five years?
</P>
<P>
   Debtors who make less than the median income, or who don't meet
the other two criteria, would be allowed to discharge all their
debts under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
</P>
<P>
   But debtors with enough assets to satisfy all three questions
would be limited to a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, requiring them to
repay a portion of their debts monthly during a five-year period.
</P>
<P>
   An Ernst &AMP; Young study, commissioned by Visa Inc., concluded
that 15 percent (later modified to 11 percent) of Americans who
seek bankruptcy protection can ``repay a significant portion of
their debts'' and return $4 billion to unsecured creditors.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers at Creighton University in Omaha, who conducted
a study funded by the nonprofit American Bankruptcy Institute,
countered that less than 3.6 percent of bankruptcy filers could
repay their unsecured creditors _ and at most pay back $930
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Creighton researchers suggested that, even under the current
bill, nearly 97 percent of debtors who file for Chapter 7 discharge
would be unable to repay their creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Visa officials didn't respond to interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   Creighton University professors Marianne Culhane and Michaela
White said the Visa study underestimated administrative costs and
expenses debtors still have for such things as maintaining the
family car.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main consumer provisions are misguided,'' Culhane argues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The costs of conducting the test on so many (debtors), to get
so few, isn't worth it.''  &LR; brk:Opposing sides
</P>
<P>
   Much of the debate turns on contrasting philosophies.
</P>
<P>
   Those who favor changes see American morals breaking down. ``We
have to weed out and stop abuse by people who...are manipulating
the system to their own advantage,'' said George Mason University
law professor Todd Zywicki, who gave testimony to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Critics cite the creation of bankruptcy courts in the
Constitution and the need to provide citizens a fresh start. They
argue that bankruptcy serves as a safety valve in a capitalistic
economy, as opposed to more socialistic safety nets in European
nations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Frank Koger said bankruptcy is a hard
concept to reconcile ``because it is contrary to our traditional
way of looking at life _ that you do what you say you will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ``Clearly, when our forefathers talk about
bankruptcy, they are negating the idea of debtors' prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, no one is pleased that bankruptcy rates have
skyrocketed from 172,000 filers in 1978 to approximately 1.4
million in each of the past three years, despite a dip this past
year.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers regret the lack of shame they say once kept debtors
from filing for bankruptcy, except as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   But economists aren't willing to let the credit industry off the
hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is increased willingness to file for bankruptcy,''
agreed Brian Nottage, an economist with RFA Dismal Sciences, a
Philadelphia consulting firm that publishes the Regional Financial
Review.
</P>
<P>
   ``But an awful lot of that is because the lenders loosened their
standards. They became too efficient at creating debt.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 Regional Financial Review article linked the ``surge in
credit problems'' to a striking rise in the household debt service
burden _ the percentage of a family's income after taxes that goes
to pay its debts _ from 15.3 percent in 1993 to 17.6 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, not everyone is hurting.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve's recent Survey of Consumer Finances had
good news for most middle- and upper-class families. Their debt
burdens declined slightly from 1995 to 1998, as the nation's median
income rose.
</P>
<P>
   Lower interest rates in 1999, healthy employment and a temporary
tightening of industry loan standards resulted in more people
paying down their credit cards and 112,000 fewer personal
bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
   But some economists don't see this trend continuing. And they
don't see a bright future for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's survey found that debt burdens rose substantially for
families already struggling with high debts. And this, say
economists, holds a warning for the next decade.  &LR; brk:Lowering
standards
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates are already climbing. And as they see markets for
affluent customers approach saturation, credit card companies are
plunging deeper into subprime markets to snag profits from riskier
and lower-income borrowers, whom they might have shunned before.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to generate loan growth in a competitive environment,
you have to lower your standards some what,'' Nottage said.
``Lenders are almost forced into markets they wouldn't be in
otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Federal Reserve study, month, ] economists Ken Spong
and Richard Sullivan noted the worry that consumer debt has hit
record levels. Also, they said, ``bank supervisors have recently
voiced concerns that bank credit standards are weakening.''
</P>
<P>
   The volatile mix of riskier borrowers, higher debt and lowered
lending standards to boost profits suggests to some experts that
the number of overextended consumers trying to buy the American
dream will worsen _ as will loan delinquency rates. ``In some ways
(the reform bill) is bailing out the industry,'' Nottage said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers already see more lower-income and former
middle-income consumers in bankruptcy _ workers who make $25,000 or
less at cyclical jobs, for whom a medical expense, divorce or death
in the family can suddenly launch them into financial distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more creditors extend loans to lower-income people and to
people out of work and otherwise in credit trouble, it would not be
surprising if the bankruptcy pool expanded to include people with
lower and lower incomes,'' said Harvard Law professor Elizabeth
Warren, who worked on an earlier version of the bankruptcy reform.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sheets, director of community development for the Consumer
Credit Counseling Service of Greater Kansas City, agrees that
bankruptcy holds an allure as a way to reduce the pain when
financial distress seems intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``I'd hate to see bankruptcy get so tough, that
the means test would put so much obligation on people that they
can't get a fresh start. You don't want to make changes
helter-skelter.''

<P>
   SEATTLE _ An Alaska Airlines jetliner with 88 passengers and
crew bound for Seattle crashed into the Pacific Ocean off
California Monday. There was no sign of survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261, an MD-83 enroute from Puerto Vallarta with a stop in
San Francisco, lost radio contact and plunged into the ocean at
about 4:36 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   While the cause of the crash wasn't immediately known the pilot
reported problems with the mechanism that controls the plane's
horizontal trim. They asked permission to land the plane at Los
Angeles, according to Alaska. The plane crashed just 20 miles
northwest of Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Search and rescue team, some 12 miles off the California coast,
scoured the 10- to 12-foot swells at crash site into evening
darkness, recovering parts of the shattered plane and several
bodies, but no survivors, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our No. 1 priority right now is to take care of friends and
family of the passengers,'' said Alaska spokesman Jack Evans at a
press conference at company headquarters in SeaTac.
</P>
<P>
   The first rescue teams on the scene were unable to locate any
survivors, but officials said the search would continue through the
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always hope there will be a survivor out there,'' said
Coast Guard Captain George Wright, at a press conference at U.S.
Coast Guard headquarters in Long Beach ``We will always look as
along as we can until there's zero chance of survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials, meanwhile, dispatched investigative teams to
the site of the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board
sent an emergency group of experts, known as a Go Team, early this
morning. Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration said it was
sending its own experts.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board was also sending experts to aid families of the
crash victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not yet know and cannot speculate about what happened to
FLight 261,'' said Alaska chief executive officer John F. Kelly, in
a prepared statement released Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was only the third fatal accident for Alaska Airlines
in 29 years and the first since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 4, 1971, an Alaska 727 crashed into a mountainside as
it was preparing to land in Juneau, Alaska. All 111 people on board
were killed.
</P>
<P>
   On April 5, 1976, another Alaska 727 slid off the runway in
Ketchikan, Alaska. One passenger was killed. Several passengers and
crew members were injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airplane does have a great record,'' said Boeing chairman
Phil Condit.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft involved in Monday night's crash had logged 26,584
hours of flight time and had taken off and landed 14,315 times. It
was equipped with JT8D Pratt and Whitney engines.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-83 is an updated version of the MD-80, built by McDonnell
Douglas at Long Beach, Calif., which first entered service in 1980.
It carries 144 to 152 passengers and is distinctive for its two
engines mounted on the rear of the fuselage and its high tail
section or horizontal stabilizer. The were 1,191 MD-80, -82 and -83
models made.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots reported problems with the aircraft's stabilizer trim
mechanism, a wing-like surface at the tail of the plane. It
includes the elevators, panels that point the nose up and down.
Stabilizer trim tabs are movable surfaces on the horizontal
stabilizer that help adjust the wing's aerodynamics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trimming'' the stabilizer is an action a pilot uses to bring
it into balance. The trim tabs are controlled, or ``trimmed,'' via
a wheel in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   If a plane lost control of its horizontal stabilizer, it would
have no way to keep the nose pointed at the proper angle up or
down. Gravity would force the plane into an uncontrollable dive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aircraft had no history of stabilizer trim problems,'' the
airline said in a statement released Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines is the nation's tenth-largest carrier. It
operates a fleet of 88 aircraft, includung 38 MD-80s the carrier
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until today it was probably the best domestic record in the
industry,'' Jon Proctor, editor of Airliners magazine, said late
yesterday. ``Twenty-four years since a fatal accident. That's a
long time in today's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Airliners magazine covers the airline industry and has editorial
offices in Sandpoint, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The crash is the first for a U.S. commercial airline involving
fatalities since an American Airlines MD-82 crashed in Little Rock,
Ark., last June 1, killing 11 people as the pilot attempted to land
in a heavy storm.

ANGEL FLIGHT CENTRAL HELPS ILL CHILD FLY HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 2OOO Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Michael McMahan squints out the plane window
with a crack of hazel green eyes. His long eyelashes rise and fall,
washing the panoramic view into focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look Michael, there they are,'' says his mother, Terri, above
the steady wa-a-a-a-a of the single turboprop engine. ``Look
Michael. Do you see them?''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine thousand feet below them on Monday, gauzy clouds
dissipated over western Kansas. From this height, the flat ground
begins to wrinkle, as if an unseen foot has rumpled the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Michael struggles for a better view. This is a dream coming
true. Thanks to Angel Flight Central, an organization that provides
flights to people for medical care or flights of compassion, a
10-year-old boy dying of an inoperable brain-tumor, is living big.
</P>
<P>
   Michael is about to see a mountain for real.
</P>
<P>
   Below, rising in the cobalt sky, are steep ridges and crags.
White mist rises skyward. Pointy tops glisten with fresh snow.
Sunshine casts purple-blue shadows into mysterious ravines and
illuminates an ancient path where a prehistoric glacier left its
mark.
</P>
<P>
   Michael shifts his head to the right. His head wobbles. His
shoulder rises as he takes a deep breath, but he doesn't say a
word. Moving takes his breath away. So he just stares.
</P>
<P>
   His left eye streams water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael, this is really something,'' his mother says. She dabs
a paper towel at his eye. She touches his face with the back of her
hand, smoothing a wayward strand of dark hair. Moms do that.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good day for him and her.
</P>
<P>
   She tries not to think about tomorrow. Not now, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Michael began dreaming of mountains in August, a little after
his 10th birthday. That was one month after the diagnosis of an
inoperable brain-stem tumor. One month after a doctor told him,
straight out, that Michael probably had nine months to a year to
live. One month after Michael ran up and down the hallways of
Children's Mercy Hospital screaming that he wanted to live.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, though, on this flight, Michael is living.
</P>
<P>
   Michael, who lives in the flat state of Kansas, began drawing
mountains in art therapy. He stared at posters of them. He asked
questions about mountains to whoever would listen.
</P>
<P>
   He told his mom that the closest place on Earth to God must be
on a mountain.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael couldn't set foot on a mountain; he was too sick.
Even the change in air pressure could be enough to kill him,
doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   So, at Christmas, a group called the Elves of Christmas Present
brought the mountains to Michael, overnight, while he slept in his
brother's bedroom. In the earliest hours of Christmas, they
installed a triptych painting in his room, complete with track
lights and a sound machine of birds and brooks.
</P>
<P>
   That was pretty cool, he later told his mom.
</P>
<P>
   At his school in Leavenworth, his classmates used to tease him
when he first started gaining weight from the drugs. Now they're
learning about cancer and how the human body works and how
medicines can help people live _ and sometimes, how they can't.
</P>
<P>
   In January the White House heard about Michael. First lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton sent him a gift basket filled with photos of
Socks and Buddy and herself and a book and even a bag of official
Air Force One M&AMP;M's. The U.S. Army gave the presents to him in his
Leavenworth, Kan., school assembly, complete with an induction
ceremony. They draped personalized dog tags over his neck and
helped him wear his own Army uniform. Then every child in his
school got a free ride in a Humvee.
</P>
<P>
   That was really cool, he told his mom.
</P>
<P>
   But he still hadn't seen a real mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Staring at the mountain painting in his room, he told his mom
that mountains reminded him of his dad.
</P>
<P>
   Michael's dad, Michael McMahan, is in prison, scheduled for
release in September. Doctors told little Michael that he probably
wouldn't be around to see that day.
</P>
<P>
   So, Michael has another dream. He wants to play with his dad in
a mountain pile of leaves or snow, as they used to do. Before
prison. Before Michael got sick.
</P>
<P>
   A brain scan a few weeks ago showed that Michael's tumor had
grown an additional 50 percent. He wobbles more. He can't hear in
his left ear. His face is swollen with stretch marks, even on his
neck. His left hand is curling more tightly. He can't stand up
easily.
</P>
<P>
   Intravenous chemotherapy is his last hope, along with a new pill
he started taking two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But his mom is waiting before Michael does the chemo. Side
effects cause nausea. Life isn't too fun then. Good times are
slipping by, too quickly, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't let him see me cry,'' she says. She looks at him and
smiles, then pats his leg.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't cry around his mom. Only his hospice nurse, Sheri
Johnson, knows about those tears. For now, Michael is the head man
in the McMahan home. He has three younger siblings: Lance, 8;
April, 9; and Nicole, 7.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to talk to his dad, alone, a wish that might come true.
He's worried about ``after,'' his nurse says.
</P>
<P>
   At 10, he has big dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Dreams as big as mountains.

CRIMINAL PROBE LOOKS AT MAINTENANCE OF MD-80S 
</HEADLINE>
   (Resending to correct figure in 5th graf, Adds 2nd graph on crash:
``Monday ...'')  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The MD-80 series of airplanes has been a workhorse of
Alaska Airlines' fleet, taking the carrier's passengers up and down
the West Coast for years. It also has been at the center of a
criminal investigation into Alaska Airlines maintenance and a
long-running controversy over fumes in the passenger cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, one of Alaska's MD-80s crashed off the coast of
California with 88 people aboard. The maintenance of planes like
the one that crashed has been the subject of the federal criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   John Liotine, an Alaska lead mechanic in Oakland, Calif., set
the criminal investigation into motion in October 1998 when he
contacted an inspector with the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Records released under the Freedom of Information Act last year
showed that Liotine complained that an Alaska supervisor filled out
a post-maintenance checklist on an MD-80 even though he wasn't
qualified to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska repairs its 38 MD-80s at the Oakland maintenance
facility.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that initial contact by Liotine:
</P>
<P>
   -- A criminal investigation has been under way involving a
federal grand jury in San Francisco, the FBI, the U.S.
Transportation Department and the U.S. Attorney's Office. No
charges have been filed in the case.
</P>
<P>
   -- The FAA has recommended that the mechanic's licenses of three
Alaska supervisors in Oakland be revoked for making false entries
on records.
</P>
<P>
   -- The FAA also proposed a $44,000 fine against Alaska. An
agency inspector in Oakland originally proposed an $8.7 million
fine. But FAA lawyers determined that top Alaska executives weren't
involved, so the size of the proposed fine was reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, which has been the subject of news reports
for months, focuses on two MD-80s, including one in which a manager
allegedly released a plane for service with its throttle set
improperly.
</P>
<P>
   An FAA inspector in Oakland concluded that the two MD-80 jets
were flown 844 times from Oct. 7, 1998, through Jan. 19, 1999, ``in
an unairworthy condition'' because portions of records that
document maintenance hadn't been filled out.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska has said that the alleged violations involved only
record-keeping and that the jets were safe to fly.
</P>
<P>
   What first caused Liotine to act was the signing of a checklist
by a manager he believed was unqualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``A significant driving force in this endeavor has been the
downward trend among the ranks of maintenance personnel and this
management team with respect to actual work experience in the
performance of the duties entrusted to them,'' Liotine wrote in a
statement to the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote that corrective action in the company for these
problems was lacking, as was ``interest by our management to
honestly deal with these causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Liotine's whistle-blowing cost him his post of president of a
local chapter of the mechanics' union. Other union members recalled
him from his post last year, and a letter from a union committee
that backed his recall cited his involvement in the criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska also put Liotine on leave with pay in September. The
company cited the investigation as well as ``the strains on the
existing operation.''
</P>
<P>
   The MD-80 also has been the source of dozens of complaints about
air quality in the cabin. For a decade, Alaska flight attendants
have blamed a range of maladies _ headaches, goiters, tremors and
lost mental abilities _ on what they believe are toxic fumes.
</P>
<P>
   About three-quarters of the hundreds of complaints focus on the
MD-80. The airline also flies Boeing 737s.
</P>
<P>
   Several flight attendants are too sick to work, and others have
been put on reduced duties.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and company investigations have yet to pinpoint a source
of the problems. Because of the difficulty in connecting illnesses
to the planes, flight attendants have generally failed in their
attempts to get worker's compensation.

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
NORMAN, Okla. _ You can sum up the difference between the first
Oklahoma-Texas game and the game Monday night in just two words _
Gabe Muoneke.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The talented Texas forward scored a season-high 30 points in
UT's win in Austin two weeks ago, but he had one of his worst games
of the season Monday as the Sooners defeated the Longhorns 83-59 in
front of an ecstatic crowd of 12,053 at Lloyd Noble Center.
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke got in immediate foul trouble, played only 16 minutes
and ended up with a sore knee. He grabbed only two rebounds and
scored six points, equaling his season low.
</P>
<P>
   While Muoneke struggled, Oklahoma senior forward Eduardo Najera
was having a night to remember, finishing with 18 points and 16
rebounds for his fourth consecutive double double and his 10th of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Najera had 28 points and four rebounds in the loss at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was proud with the way we played tonight,'' Najera said.
``Our goal is to win the Big 12 championship, and this win gives us
a chance to do that. We felt we needed to win this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke was known for his bad-boy image last season, and he
received his first technical foul of the season less than two
minutes into the game when official Curtis Shaw whistled Muoneke
for trash-talking after making a layup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had my head down saying something to myself,'' Muoneke
said. ``I was trying to psych myself up, something I do all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second foul of the game for Muoneke, and he went to
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a problem with it,'' UT coach Rick Barnes said of the
technical call. ``I asked the official what happened, but what he
told me Gabe said and what the players told me he said are two
different things. So I do have a problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke said his second-half knee injury was only a bruise.
</P>
<P>
   Texas center Chris Mihm was the only Longhorn to finish the game
in double figures, leading the team with 21 points and 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't give our best effort by any means,'' Mihm said.
``Pretty early on in the first half we spotted them a big lead. We
dug ourselves a hole and couldn't get a run. They just played
harder tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard J.R. Raymond led the Sooners with 25 points, making four
3-pointers and six of 12 shots overall. Backup center Victor Avila
had his best night in a conference game with 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the worst of the season for the 16th-ranked
Longhorns (14-6, 6-2 Big 12) and leaves Iowa State alone on top of
the conference at 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   For the 18th-ranked Sooners (17-3, 5-2), it was the most
lopsided victory over Texas since the Big 12 was formed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our team played a complete 40 minutes,'' said OU
coach Kelvin Sampson. ``We threw a lot of things at Texas and
forced them to beat us with double teams. We're a lot better now
than we were a month ago, and I think this team will continue to
get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gotten smarter. Our basketball team grew up a lot
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas led 17-16 with 12:05 to go in the first half, but the
Longhorns went the next 8:18 without making a basket, missing 14
consecutive shots. UT shot only 34 percent for the game (21 of 61)
while OU hit 53 percent (31 of 58).
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners led 40-28 at the half, the biggest halftime deficit
of the season for the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke, who had to sit out 12 minutes of the first half, was on
the bench again only two minutes into the second half when he
picked up his third foul with Texas trailing 46-30.
</P>
<P>
   At that point it was clear this wasn't going to be Muoneke's
night. The 6-7 senior from Cypress Falls returned with 13:39 to go
and OU in front 53-37. Shortly after returning, Muoneke injured his
right knee while guarding Najera and left again.
</P>
<P>
   He limped back onto the court with 7:43 to go, but the game was
out of reach at that point with OU leading 63-46. Muoneke left the
game for good three minutes later.

JET WITH NEARLY 90 ON BOARD CRASHES OFF CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An Alaska Airlines jetliner bound from Mexico to
San Francisco crashed into the Pacific Ocean northwest of Malibu on
Monday afternoon with nearly 90 people aboard after reporting
mechanical difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard boats, rescue helicopters and a Navy search plane
scoured the choppy waters for hours into the winter twilight and
long past darkness, finding several bodies but no immediate
survivors, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to search for survivors until there's zero chance
of finding anybody from this tragedy alive,'' Capt. George Wright
of the Los Angeles area Coast Guard command at Long Beach said at a
news conference on Monday night. ``We have seen miracles happen in
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The jet, an MD-83 headed from the Mexican beach resort of Puerto
Vallarta, had reported mechanical difficulties and requested
permission to land at Los Angeles International Airport, Ron
Wilson, a spokesman for San Francisco International Airport told a
local television station there.
</P>
<P>
   At about 4:30 p.m., the plane, Alaska Airlines Flight 261, was
reported down in the ocean off the Naval Air Station at Point Mugu,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An Alaska Airlines spokesman told reporters at Los Angeles
International Airport on Monday evening that the pilots had
reported a problem with the plane's stabilizer trim, a device that
helps control the horizontal stabilizing mechanism that governs the
pitch of the plane's nose. The MD-80 series has no history of such
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson reported that radar indicated that the plane had fallen
from 17,000 feet and then had been lost from radar screens. Skies
were clear at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Evans, a spokesman for Alaska Air, said the plane was
carrying 83 passengers and 5 crew members, but throughout the
evening, there was confusion on this point. An FAA spokeswoman said
at one point that there were 65 passengers and 5 crew members
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger list will not be released for at least a day, said
Cindy Fraser, a manager for the airline in San Francisco. Alaska
Airlines said passengers' family members could call 800-553-5117
for information.
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials said the plane's two pilots were based in Los
Angeles and its three flight attendants in Seattle. Of the
passengers, 33 were bound for San Francisco, 47 for Seattle, 3 for
Eugene, Ore., and 1 for Fairbanks, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The plane came down about 20 miles northwest of Los Angeles
International Airport, the FAA said, in water from 300 to more than
600 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell, local television stations offered live coverage
of search helicopters hovering over scattered debris and a
spreading fuel slick on the deep blue water about 12 miles
offshore, where water temperatures were in the high 50s at the
surface, and colder at greater depths, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As temperatures cooled and searchlights played across the 10- to
12-foot swells, the efforts drew more than 20 Coast Guard and Navy
craft from as far away as San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Petty Officer Randy Mitchell of the Coast Guard's station
in Oxnard, Calif., the base of rescue operations, said on Monday
evening that searchers had discovered bodies, but would not say how
many. He said helicopters equipped with heat-seeking infrared
devices were being used trying to pick up any heat from survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Early on Monday evening, the Coast Guard ordered private craft,
which had sailed into the area, to stay away from the debris field
to avoid any confusion in search and rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board, said in a telephone interview on ``Larry King Live'' on CNN
that a so-called Go-Team, from the agency was scheduled to leave
the East Coast Tuesday morning to begin its investigation of the
crash, and was already considering whether to call for additional
Coast Guard ships from Hawaii for possible salvage efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're just trying to gather information,'' Hall
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Air 261 is a seven-day-a-week flight from Puerto Vallarta
to San Francisco. It is scheduled to depart at 3:30 p.m. and arrive
at 5:05 p.m. It was then to continue on to Seattle, Alaska's
headquarters. The plane that usually flies the route is a MD-80, or
an updated model like the MD-83, which has two engines attached to
the fuselage near the tail. The models first entered service in
1980, and depending on configuration, usually carry 144 to 152
passengers. About 1,170 of them have been built.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of relatives were whisked away to a VIP lounge at San
Francisco International Airport by airline officials. Clergy
members, grief counselors and Red Cross officials were reported to
be on the way to the airport offer help to about a dozen people,
who were being offered food, lodging and transportation. The public
address system at the airport made periodic announcements that
anyone waiting to meet a passenger on Flight 261 should report to a
ticket agent.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-83, a two-engine craft with engines on the tail, is the
successor to the McDonnell-Douglas DC-9, and like the Boeing 737 is
frequently used on mid-range flights. The jet was built less than
eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials said that the plane underwent routine
servicing on Sunday, had last had a more extensive check on Jan. 11
and had its last in-depth performance check _ given every 15 months
_ just over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   If the pilots were having trouble trimming the horizontal
stabilizer, it would mean that they were having difficulty bringing
the plane into the proper pitch up or down.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer is brought into balance, or ``trimmed,'' by
spinning a wheel in the cockpit. When a plane has the proper trim,
its nose will fly level, instead of pitching up or down.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, the Alaska spokesman, said the plane in question
completed 14,315 cycles of takeoffs and landings. The craft had
more than 26,000 hours of flying time.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines, the nation's 10th largest, has built a
successful business and strong safety record operating north-south
routes serving more than 40 cities in Canada, Mexico and states up
and down the Pacific Coast. Based in Seattle, it operates 88
aircraft, including 38 MD-80s, and is owned by Alaska Air Group,
which also owns Horizon Air.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines had two fatal accidents in the 1970s, both in
Alaska, according to Airsafe.com, a Web site that tracks plane
crashes. In 1971, a Boeing 727 approaching Juneau crashed into a
mountain after the crew had received misleading navigational
information. All 104 passengers and seven crew members were killed.
In 1976, one passenger was killed when a 727 overran a runway in
Ketchikan.
</P>
<P>
   The crash is the first for a American commercial airline
involving fatalities since an American Airlines MD-82 crashed in
Little Rock, Ark., last June 1, killing 11 people including the
pilot, as it attempted to land in a heavy storm.
</P>
<P>
   Last Oct. 31, EgyptAir Flight 990 plummeted into the ocean 60
miles south of the Massachusetts island of Nantucket. All 217
people aboard the Boeing 767 were killed.

STUMPEL'S OFFENSE SLOWLY RETURNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ All season, Los Angeles Kings coach Andy Murray
has pointed to the production of the first line as critical to the
team's success down the stretch. What he really meant was center
Jozef Stumpel.
</P>
<P>
   Murray knows veteran Luc Robitaille will get his goals.
Robitaille leads the club with 24. Ziggy Palffy has been slowed by
a bad back, but he is averaging almost a point a game.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel scored the Kings first goal in Monday's 5-2 victory over
the New York Islanders. It was his just his fourth of the year but
his second in five games since returning from a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   He also added two assists. The first came on Robitaille's goal
early in the second period on a slick cross-ice pass that first
glanced off the stick of Palffy. The second was a no-look pass to
the slot that Glen Murray took for the Kings' fourth goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are coming around,'' said Stumpel, who has missed 10
weeks this season with knee and abdominal problems. ``All you want
is a chance to stay healthy and contribute. We're halfway through
the season, but for me it feels like it is just beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel has no chance to match his career best numbers from two
years ago when he was in the NHL Top 10 in scoring with 58 assists
and 79 points.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings, who have been struggling the past six weeks, are
no longer assured of a playoff spot in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel has 32 games to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a goal tonight, but his greatest contribution to the
team is as a playmaker,'' GM Dave Taylor said. ``Stumpy is at his
best when he is setting up Luc and Ziggy. But when he's right, he's
good for 20 goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem has been keeping him healthy. Stumpel has had a
history of injuries dating back to his early years in Boston. Last
season, Stumpel sprained an ankle during the first scrimmage in
training camp and never really was 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stumpy has a big body (6-foot-3, 225 pounds) and he mixes it
up pretty well in the middle,'' said Taylor, who acquired Stumpel
with Sandy Moger and a fourth-round choice in the 1998 draft for
Dimitri Khristich and Byron Dafoe on Aug. 29, 1997. ``You can get
pretty banged up in there. But there is no question that if he can
stay healthy the rest of the way, he will make a big difference to
this club.''

AIR CARRIER HAS GROWN OVER THE YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With ALASKA-AIRCRASH) 
(sw) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines has grown over its 65-year history from a single
three-passenger plane chugging across the tundra to the nation's
10th-biggest carrier, as ranked by Aviation Daily, which closely
monitors the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The smiling, crinkly-eyed Eskimo whose likeness adorns the tails
of the airline's 89 jets is a particularly familiar sight on
tarmacs up and down the West Coast, where Alaska is the dominant
carrier between the Pacific Northwest and California.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, a subsidiary of Alaska Air, based in Seattle,
carried 13.1 million passengers in 1998 and now serves 41 cities in
the United States, Mexico and Canada. With more than 9,200
employees and 1999 sales of $2.08 billion, the airline is also one
of the biggest businsses in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   While it has faced criticism and sanctions from the Federal
Aviation Administration for maintenance practices, the airline had
not had a fatal crash in more than 25 years until Monday and is a
perennial favorite in customer satisfaction surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines is owned by the Alaska Air Group, a holding
company that also owns Horizon Air, a smaller carrier. According to
the company's history, Alaska Airlines traces its roots to McGee
Airways, which started service between Anchorage and Bristol Bay,
Alaska, in 1932. The airline took the name Alaska Airlines in 1944
and grew through mergers and acquisitions, including that of Jet
America Airlines, a carrier based in California, in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines says it was the first airline to fly over the
North Pole, the first to offer regularly scheduled service from the
West Coast to Russia, the first American airline to sell tickets
over the internet and, in 1996, the first airline to use global
positioning system technology on a commercial flight.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's fleet of 89 planes consists of 35 MD-80s, or
variations thereof, and 54 Boeing 737s.
</P>
<P>
   The only two fatal incidents in its history were in 1971, when
faulty instrument readings caused an Alaska Boeing 727 to crash
into a mountain outside Juneau, killing 111 people, and in 1976,
when a plane overran a runway in Ketchikan and a passenger died of
a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The airline has generally been popular with travelers. In 1999,
Travel and Leisure magazine named it the world's ``best domestic
airline.''
</P>
<P>
   But the airline has occasionally run afoul of the federal
authorities. Last August, The Seattle Times reported that Federal
Aviation Administration records showed that Alaska Airlines flew
two of its MD-80s more than 840 times in 1998 and 1999 without
having done proper maintence on them.
</P>
<P>
   The planes were allowed to fly despite falsified maintenance
checks that included work by an Alaska Airlines supervisor who was
``not appropriately certified, properly trained or qualified to do
so,'' the paper quoted the agency as saying. According to the
agency, the airline released a an MD-80 for service in October 1998
despite 10 occasions in which maintenance work was performed out of
sequence and with incomplete final checks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the airline paid a $300,000 fine for violating federal
safety rules.

Two physicists in Sweden have now theorized that the same effects
may be produced in laboratories: light could be gobbled up by
swirling gases and fluids that look suspiciously like water going
down an ordinary drain. Called an optical black hole, this
laboratory creation would rely on the recent discovery that in
certain substances, light can be slowed from its usual 186,000

   OXNARD, Calif. _ Minutes after reporting mechanical problems
Monday, an Alaska Airlines jet with 88 people aboard plunged
nose-first into the Pacific Ocean off Point Mugu. There were no
signs of survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261, en route nonstop from the Mexican resort of Puerto
Vallarta to San Francisco and then on to Seattle, disappeared from
radar around 3:45 p.m. after its crew reported problems with the
stabilizer trim on the MD-83 jetliner and asked permission to make
an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   On Anacapa Island, a witness saw the plane plummet into the
Pacific Ocean about 9 miles off the coast.
</P>
<P>
   A broad oil slick littered with debris marked the crash scene.
At least one body was recovered, with unconfirmed reports placing
the number at seven.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard and Navy ships and helicopters, aided by the boats
of Channel Island fishermen, searched the cold and choppy water
through the night, bringing pieces of wreckage back to shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every resource we can muster either on-scene or en
route,'' said Coast Guard Capt. George Wright. ``We are going to
search for survivors until there is about zero chance of finding
anyone alive.''
</P>
<P>
   As darkness fell, the Coast Guard's four helicopters, one
airplane and three boats on the scene were joined by more than a
dozen civilian boats combing the water for survivors. Coast Guard
personnel were armed with infrared vision devices to spot the body
heat of survivors floating on the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always hope there will be a survivor out there,''
Wright said. ``We've seen miracles before.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the 58-degree water temperature, however, officials said
it was unlikely people could survive for long.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration officials and a National
Transportation Safety Board spokesman said an investigative team
was immediately mobilized and was expected to arrive in Los Angeles
early today. The team will lead recovery efforts and seek the cause
of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   An Alaska Airlines spokesman said the plane, built by McDonnell
Douglas, now a division of Boeing, had no previous problems with
the stabilizer trim, which automatically balances the aircraft
during slight upward and downward movements.
</P>
<P>
   The flight left Puerto Vallarta at 2:30 p.m. Pacific time and
was scheduled to land in San Francisco just after 5 p.m. before
heading on to Seattle later in the evening. Eighty-three passengers
and five crew members were on board, according to the airline.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two passengers were bound for San Francisco, according to
the airline. An additional 47 were headed on to Seattle, three were
going to Eugene, Ore., and one was headed to Fairbanks, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic controllers lost contact with the crew over Los
Angeles air space as the plane cruised up the coast at 17,000 feet,
said a spokesman for San Francisco International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials said the crew members radioed that they were
having trouble with the stabilizer trim and were diverted back to
LAX.
</P>
<P>
   The jet was still 20 miles northwest of the airport when it
crashed, plunging into water at least 300 feet deep. There were
conflicting reports about the time of the crash. The Federal
Aviation Administration reported that the plane disappeared from
radar about 3:45 p.m. The initial report of a crash reached the
Coast Guard around 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   On Anacapa Island, roughly two miles away from the crash, a
National Park Service employee watched the plane slam into the
ocean, said Suzan Smith, a spokeswoman for Channel Islands National
Park in Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went in nose first,'' she said. She declined to identify
the employee.
</P>
<P>
   The plane hit just outside the park's boundaries, she said. The
employee called in the crash to the park's dispatch center, which
called the Coast Guard with the information. The park's dispatchers
also reached a fishing boat crew that had witnessed the crash and
was rushing to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokesman Mitch Barker said the first reports of the crash
indicated the plane was upside down in the water. Further details
were not available Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The twin-engine plane was built in 1992 and is a version of the
MD-80 first flown in 1979. Since then McDonnell Douglas, and now
Boeing, has sold nearly 1,200 of the MD-80s in various versions.
</P>
<P>
   A passenger list was not available Monday evening. However,
those who think family members may have been on the plane can call
(800) 553-5117 to reach the airline.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross of Greater Los Angeles deployed a team to
LAX to provide grief counseling to relatives of passengers and crew
members who live in the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteer air team includes mental health workers, an
administrator and logistics workers to provide food and shelter. At
LAX, a handful of relatives of passengers and crew members were
eligible to take advantage of the grief counseling, a spokesperson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The news stunned other travelers at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines passenger Mercedes Pearlta of Modesto called
home as soon as she landed at LAX for a stopover and found out
about the crash. She said her son and his friends were watching the
news unfold on television and were trying to determine what
happened to Pearlta, who was flying home from a trip to Mazatlan.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son was just panicked,'' said Pearlta, teary-eyed but still
determined to catch her next flight to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just relieved but I'm really scared,'' she said. ``I want
to get home.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An Alaska Airlines jetliner bound from Mexico to
San Francisco crashed into the Pacific Ocean northwest of Malibu on
Monday afternoon with nearly 90 people aboard after reporting
mechanical difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard boats, rescue helicopters and a Navy search plane
scoured the choppy waters for hours into the winter twilight and
long past darkness, finding several bodies but no immediate
survivors, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to search for survivors until there's zero chance
of finding anybody from this tragedy alive,'' Capt. George Wright
of the Los Angeles area Coast Guard command at Long Beach said at a
news conference on Monday night. ``We have seen miracles happen in
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The jet, an MD-83 headed from the Mexican beach resort of Puerto
Vallarta, had reported mechanical difficulties and requested
permission to land at Los Angeles International Airport, Ron
Wilson, a spokesman for San Francisco International Airport told a
local television station there.
</P>
<P>
   At about 4:30 p.m., the plane, Alaska Airlines Flight 261, was
reported down in the ocean off the Naval Air Station at Point Mugu,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An Alaska Airlines spokesman told reporters at Los Angeles
International Airport on Monday evening that the pilots had
reported a problem with the plane's stabilizer trim, a device that
helps control the horizontal stabilizing mechanism that governs the
pitch of the plane's nose. The MD-80 series has no history of such
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson reported that radar indicated that the plane had fallen
from 17,000 feet and then had been lost from radar screens. Skies
were clear at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Evans, a spokesman for Alaska Air, said the plane was
carrying 83 passengers and 5 crew members, but throughout the
evening, there was confusion on this point. An FAA spokeswoman said
at one point that there were 65 passengers and 5 crew members
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger list will not be released for at least a day, said
Cindy Fraser, a manager for the airline in San Francisco. Alaska
Airlines said passengers' family members could call 800-553-5117
for information.
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials said the plane's two pilots were based in Los
Angeles and its three flight attendants in Seattle. Of the
passengers, 33 were bound for San Francisco, 47 for Seattle, 3 for
Eugene, Ore., and 1 for Fairbanks, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The plane came down about 20 miles northwest of Los Angeles
International Airport, the FAA said, in water from 300 to more than
600 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell, local television stations offered live coverage
of search helicopters hovering over scattered debris and a
spreading fuel slick on the deep blue water about 12 miles
offshore, where water temperatures were in the high 50s at the
surface, and colder at greater depths, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As temperatures cooled and searchlights played across the 10- to
12-foot swells, the efforts drew more than 20 Coast Guard and Navy
craft from as far away as San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Petty Officer Randy Mitchell of the Coast Guard's station
in Oxnard, Calif., the base of rescue operations, said on Monday
evening that searchers had discovered bodies, but would not say how
many. He said helicopters equipped with heat-seeking infrared
devices were being used trying to pick up any heat from survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Early on Monday evening, the Coast Guard ordered private craft,
which had sailed into the area, to stay away from the debris field
to avoid any confusion in search and rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board, said in a telephone interview on ``Larry King Live'' on CNN
that a so-called Go-Team, from the agency was scheduled to leave
the East Coast Tuesday morning to begin its investigation of the
crash, and was already considering whether to call for additional
Coast Guard ships from Hawaii for possible salvage efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're just trying to gather information,'' Hall
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Air 261 is a seven-day-a-week flight from Puerto Vallarta
to San Francisco. It is scheduled to depart at 3:30 p.m. and arrive
at 5:05 p.m. It was then to continue on to Seattle, Alaska's
headquarters. The plane that usually flies the route is a MD-80, or
an updated model like the MD-83, which has two engines attached to
the fuselage near the tail. The models first entered service in
1980, and depending on configuration, usually carry 144 to 152
passengers. About 1,170 of them have been built.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of relatives were whisked away to a VIP lounge at San
Francisco International Airport by airline officials. Clergy
members, grief counselors and Red Cross officials at the San
Francisco airport and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport offered
help to the passengers' family members.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-83, a two-engine craft with engines on the tail, is the
successor to the McDonnell-Douglas DC-9, and like the Boeing 737 is
frequently used on mid-range flights. The jet was built less than
eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials said that the plane underwent routine
servicing on Sunday, had last had a more extensive check on Jan. 11
and had its last in-depth performance check _ given every 15 months
_ just over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   If the pilots were having trouble trimming the horizontal
stabilizer, it would mean that they were having difficulty bringing
the plane into the proper pitch up or down.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer is brought into balance, or ``trimmed,'' by
spinning a wheel in the cockpit. When a plane has the proper trim,
its nose will fly level, instead of pitching up or down.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, the Alaska spokesman, said the plane in question
completed 14,315 cycles of takeoffs and landings. The craft had
more than 26,000 hours of flying time.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines, the nation's 10th largest, has built a
successful business and strong safety record operating north-south
routes serving more than 40 cities in Canada, Mexico and states up
and down the Pacific Coast. Based in Seattle, it operates 88
aircraft, including 38 MD-80s, and is owned by Alaska Air Group,
which also owns Horizon Air.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines had two fatal accidents in the 1970s, both in
Alaska, according to Airsafe.com, a Web site that tracks plane
crashes. In 1971, a Boeing 727 approaching Juneau crashed into a
mountain after the crew had received misleading navigational
information. All 104 passengers and seven crew members were killed.
In 1976, one passenger was killed when a 727 overran a runway in
Ketchikan.
</P>
<P>
   The crash is the first for a American commercial airline
involving fatalities since an American Airlines MD-82 crashed in
Little Rock, Ark., last June 1, killing 11 people including the
pilot, as it attempted to land in a heavy storm.
</P>
<P>
   Last Oct. 31, EgyptAir Flight 990 plummeted into the ocean 60
miles south of the Massachusetts island of Nantucket. All 217
people aboard the Boeing 767 were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The crash occurred a day after a Kenya Airways jetliner plunged
into the ocean off the Ivory Coast, killing all but 10 of the 179
aboard.

HOT RUMOR NOT TRUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARINA DEL REY, Calif. _ You're inside a posh Marina del Rey
hotel, looking for Antawn Jamison. From all you've heard, he should
be easy to spot. When the Golden State Warriors stumble off their
chartered bus and spill through the double doors into the lobby,
Jamison will be the one with the fangs and the claws and blood on
his breath.
</P>
<P>
   You've heard of carnivores? Well, Jamison is rumored to be a
Carlesivore. A peculiar thing, that, since everyone naturally
assumed Latrell Sprewell had been the one eyeing P.J. Carlesimo
hungrily.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was Jamison who ended up chewing Carlesimo up and
spitting him out. That's what some people are saying, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   When the Warriors fired Carlesimo on Dec. 27, some people swore
they saw Jamison's teeth marks all over the deposed head coach's
body. Jamison's agent, the story goes, had informed Carlesimo's
bosses the 6-foot-9 forward would not re-sign with the Warriors as
long as Carlesimo was the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Carlesimo's demise, after that, was swift. The official cause of
death? Internal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   You're trying to picture the earnest, polite young man you
remember from his University of North Carolina days as a coach-
killer when you're snapped out of your reverie by the deep voice of
someone who apparently has mistaken you for your mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ma'am?''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out it's Jamison, at once introducing himself and
apologizing for keeping you waiting. The team's flight Monday
arrived in Los Angeles an hour late.
</P>
<P>
   Jamison, who is in town with the Warriors for their game tonight
against the Clippers, settles into a sofa off the hotel foyer. He
is off to a better start in 2000 than Al Gore. In the first 12
games of the new year, he has averaged 24.6 points and 10.5
rebounds. The Warriors, having mercifully buried a 12-game losing
streak, are showing renewed life with wins in three of their past
four games.
</P>
<P>
   Jamison's play under Garry St. Jean has been so clearly superior
to his outlay under Carlesimo, he has unwittingly fueled the rumors
that there existed a rift between the two. He is averaging eight
minutes, seven points and three rebounds more a game since St. Jean
took over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of it is the coaching staff doing a tremendous job of
trying to put me in position where I'm able to show what I can
do,'' Jamison said. ``And half of it is me, finally making the
adjustments and feeling comfortable out there on the court. I'm
getting the opportunity to play. That's the most important thing.
When you know you're going to be out there for 30, 35 minutes,
you're not worried that if you make a mistake you're going to be
taken out.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the closest Jamison will come to criticizing Carlesimo
and he couches it with enough compassion to cushion any sting.
</P>
<P>
   ``P.J. was probably the nicest person I ever met on this
level,'' Jamison said. ``He really cared about the players, the
whole organization. For him to read in a magazine or a newspaper
that I was the main reason he left had to be hard on him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hell on Jamison, ``just because P.J. and I definitely
respected each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time Jamison read that he was behind Carlesimo's
firing, ``I just wanted to have a press conference and tell the
world I had nothing to do with it,'' he says ``I've tried to act
the right way. I didn't want people to think my head had gotten
big.''
</P>
<P>
   His friends and family know what to believe. Jamison hopes
Carlesimo does, too. He hasn't spoken to his former coach since the
firing but hopes to sit down with him at some point ``and speak the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else can think whatever they want to. ``I realized I
have to let what people are saying go in one ear and out the
other,'' Jamison says, ``because if you dwell on it, it's really
going to get to the point where it might affect your game.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jamison has been able to stay above the fray, it might be on
account of all the strength he built up over the summer trying to
keep his head above water. He returned to Chapel Hill to complete a
swimming class he needed for his undergraduate degree in
African-American studies.
</P>
<P>
   Jamison has purposefully put off the class because of his fear
of water. It was harder than anything Carlesimo ever threw at him.
``It was the most difficult thing I had to experience,'' Jamison
says.
</P>
<P>
   When he treaded water for six minutes and swam the length of a
25-yard pool to ace the class, Jamison says there was no better
feeling. Then came this past December when he stood before his
parents and friends and collected his diploma.
</P>
<P>
   That was his proudest moment yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're an athlete, you kind of sense you were given a lot
of things in life,'' Jamison says. ``That diploma is meaningful to
me because it was something I earned.''
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to his tarnished reputation, which doesn't seem at
all deserved.

SALEM CORP. BUYS DALLAS STATION
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMARILLO, Calif. _ After months of negotiations, Salem
Communications Corp., the nation's leading multimedia religious
company, agreed on Monday to buy a Dallas radio station for $7.5
million cash and one of its properties.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal with San Antonio, Texas-based AMFM Inc. for
KSKY- AM, Salem will give that company KPRZ-AM, one of three
stations it owns in Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Camarillo-based Salem expected the deal to close by July.
</P>
<P>
   That will give Salem ownership of one AM and one FM station in
the Dallas-Ft. Worth area, the nation's sixth-largest radio market.
</P>
<P>
   The company will also continue to own and operate KGFT-FM and
KBIQ-FM in Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We purchased KSKY as part of our strategy to have second and
third stations in markets where we already have a presence,'' said
Eric Halvorson, Salem's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas station also offered Christian programming so Salem
is buying out a competitor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Halvorson said the station will continue its current talk
format.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1941, KSKY has operated as a full-time Christian
station since 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``This transaction was worked on for several months,'' said
Halvorson, ``and had been delayed while the AMFM/Clear Channel
merger was completed.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon the close of this transaction, 35 of Salem's 62 stations
will be located in the nation's top 20 media markets.
</P>
<P>
   Salem's stock closed Monday at 17.25, down 50 cents.

ROBITAILLE LIFTS KINGS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Luc Robitaille keeps climbing. He just hopes the
Los Angeles Kings will join him.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille scored two goals in Monday night's 5-2 victory over
the New York Islanders that gives him 541 for his career and ties
him with Stan Mikita for 19th on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   But coming off the Kings most painful loss of the season last
Saturday in Toronto, Robitaille has far more than history on his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings needed this victory over a weak nonconference
opponent, which had beaten the Mighty Ducks and San Jose Sharks on
the first two legs of its California road trip. The Kings have not
won back-to-back games since Nov. 16, and their playoff future no
longer seems certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of great things have happened to me in the past two
years,'' said Robitaille, who scored his 500th goal on Jan. 7, 1999
and played in his 1,000th game on Jan. 4 of this year. ``All that
really matters is the Stanley Cup. The numbers are something you
look at after you retire. They're nice, but without winning they
are kind of hollow.''
</P>
<P>
   In front of 14,903 at Staples Center on Monday, Robitaille led a
resurgence of the Kings first line, which has been disrupted all
season by injuries. Robitaille missed a month with a broken left
foot and Jozef Stumpel was sidelined for 10 weeks with knee and
abdominal problems. Ziggy Palffy has been bothered by back spasms.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille finished with three points, including an assist.
Stumpel scored the game's first goal and added two assists. Palffy,
who with Bryan Smolinski came over from the Islanders in a trade
last summer, had three assists, which tied a career high last set
Feb. 29, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel scored after a pretty back-door pass by Robitaille from
behind the Islanders net. He beat New York goaltender Kevin Weekes
for his fourth goal of the season, but his second in five games
since returning from a torn muscle in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille got both of his in the second period, tying Mikita, a
Hall of Famer who teamed with the legendary Bobby Hull in Chicago
during the 1960s and early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   His first came just 1:55 into the period when he took a
cross-ice pass from Stumpel that first nicked off Palffy skate
before landing in front.
</P>
<P>
   The second was classic Robitaille, coming on a rebound after a
shot by defenseman Mattias Norstrom.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Glen Murray scored from the slot on a crisp pass
from Stumpel. It was Murray's 16th of the year, but just his third
since Dec. 10. Like the rest, Murray has been sidelined with
injuries, missing three games earlier this month with a deep chest
bruise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both lines contributed tonight and that is what we need,''
general manager Dave Taylor said. ``That's where the offense has to
come from with the third and fourth lines chipping in once in a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings only scare came late in the second period after
goaltender Stephane Fiset came out of the net to clear a puck along
the far boards.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset was struck by New York defenseman Steve Webb and
immediately doubled over in pain. Play was halted to assess Webb a
charging penalty and Fiset headed to the bench to regain his
composure.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset lost his shutout 4:01 into the third period when Jamie
Heward scored in front.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third consecutive solid effort by Fiset, who lost 3-2
to the Maple Leafs on Saturday. Toronto scored the winning goal on
a tip-in by Steve Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings led 2-0 heading into the third period and appeared
headed for their second consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
   After beating the Islanders on Monday, the Kings next chance
comes Thursday against the mighty Detroit Red Wings.

JET WITH NEARLY 90 ON BOARD CRASHES OFF CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An Alaska Airlines jetliner bound from Mexico to
San Francisco crashed into the Pacific Ocean northwest of Malibu on
Monday afternoon with nearly 90 people aboard after reporting
mechanical difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard boats, rescue helicopters and a Navy search plane
scoured the choppy waters for hours into the winter twilight and
long past darkness, finding several bodies but no immediate
survivors, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to search for survivors until there's zero chance
of finding anybody from this tragedy alive,'' Capt. George Wright
of the Los Angeles area Coast Guard command at Long Beach said at a
news conference on Monday night. ``We have seen miracles happen in
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The jet, an MD-83 headed from the Mexican beach resort of Puerto
Vallarta, had reported mechanical difficulties and requested
permission to land at Los Angeles International Airport, Ron
Wilson, a spokesman for San Francisco International Airport told a
local television station there.
</P>
<P>
   At about 4:30 p.m., the plane, Alaska Airlines Flight 261, was
reported down in the ocean off the Naval Air Station at Point Mugu,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An Alaska Airlines spokesman told reporters at Los Angeles
International Airport on Monday evening that the pilots had
reported a problem with the plane's stabilizer trim, a device that
helps control the horizontal stabilizing mechanism that governs the
pitch of the plane's nose. The MD-80 series has no history of such
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson reported that radar indicated that the plane had fallen
from 17,000 feet and then had been lost from radar screens. Skies
were clear at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Evans, a spokesman for Alaska Air, said the plane was
carrying 83 passengers and 5 crew members, but throughout the
evening, there was confusion on this point. An FAA spokeswoman said
at one point that there were 65 passengers and 5 crew members
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   CNN reported on Monday night that an Alaska Airlines official in
Puerto Vallarta said 30 airline employees were among the
passengers, flying to the United States on passes.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger list will not be released for at least a day, said
Cindy Fraser, a manager for the airline in San Francisco. Alaska
Airlines said passengers' family members could call 800-553-5117
for information.
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials said the plane's two pilots were based in Los
Angeles and its three flight attendants in Seattle. Of the
passengers, 33 were bound for San Francisco, 47 for Seattle, 3 for
Eugene, Ore., and 1 for Fairbanks, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The plane came down about 20 miles northwest of Los Angeles
International Airport, the FAA said, in water from 300 to more than
600 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell, local television stations offered live coverage
of search helicopters hovering over scattered debris and a
spreading fuel slick on the deep blue water about 12 miles
offshore, where water temperatures were in the high 50s at the
surface, and colder at greater depths, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As temperatures cooled and searchlights played across the 10- to
12-foot swells, the efforts drew more than 20 Coast Guard and Navy
craft from as far away as San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Petty Officer Randy Mitchell of the Coast Guard's station
in Oxnard, Calif., the base of rescue operations, said on Monday
evening that searchers had discovered bodies, but would not say how
many. He said helicopters equipped with heat-seeking infrared
devices were being used trying to pick up any heat from survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Early on Monday evening, the Coast Guard ordered private craft,
which had sailed into the area, to stay away from the debris field
to avoid any confusion in search and rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board, said in a telephone interview on ``Larry King Live'' on CNN
that a so-called Go-Team, from the agency was scheduled to leave
the East Coast Tuesday morning to begin its investigation of the
crash, and was already considering whether to call for additional
Coast Guard ships from Hawaii for possible salvage efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're just trying to gather information,'' Hall
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Air 261 is a seven-day-a-week flight from Puerto Vallarta
to San Francisco. It is scheduled to depart at 3:30 p.m. and arrive
at 5:05 p.m. It was then to continue on to Seattle, Alaska's
headquarters. The plane that usually flies the route is a MD-80, or
an updated model like the MD-83, which has two engines attached to
the fuselage near the tail. The models first entered service in
1980, and depending on configuration, usually carry 144 to 152
passengers. About 1,170 of them have been built.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of relatives were whisked away to a VIP lounge at San
Francisco International Airport by airline officials. Clergy
members, grief counselors and Red Cross officials at the San
Francisco airport and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport offered
help to the passengers' family members.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-83, a two-engine craft with engines on the tail, is the
successor to the McDonnell-Douglas DC-9, and like the Boeing 737 is
frequently used on mid-range flights. The jet was built less than
eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials said that the plane underwent routine
servicing on Sunday, had last had a more extensive check on Jan. 11
and had its last in-depth performance check _ given every 15 months
_ just over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   If the pilots were having trouble trimming the horizontal
stabilizer, it would mean that they were having difficulty bringing
the plane into the proper pitch up or down.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer is brought into balance, or ``trimmed,'' by
spinning a wheel in the cockpit. When a plane has the proper trim,
its nose will fly level, instead of pitching up or down.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, the Alaska spokesman, said the plane in question
completed 14,315 cycles of takeoffs and landings. The craft had
more than 26,000 hours of flying time.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines, the nation's 10th largest, has built a
successful business and strong safety record operating north-south
routes serving more than 40 cities in Canada, Mexico and states up
and down the Pacific Coast. Based in Seattle, it operates 88
aircraft, including 38 MD-80s, and is owned by Alaska Air Group,
which also owns Horizon Air.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines had two fatal accidents in the 1970s, both in
Alaska, according to Airsafe.com, a Web site that tracks plane
crashes. In 1971, a Boeing 727 approaching Juneau crashed into a
mountain after the crew had received misleading navigational
information. All 104 passengers and seven crew members were killed.
In 1976, one passenger was killed when a 727 overran a runway in
Ketchikan.
</P>
<P>
   The crash is the first for a American commercial airline
involving fatalities since an American Airlines MD-82 crashed in
Little Rock, Ark., last June 1, killing 11 people including the
pilot, as it attempted to land in a heavy storm.
</P>
<P>
   Last Oct. 31, EgyptAir Flight 990 plummeted into the ocean 60
miles south of the Massachusetts island of Nantucket. All 217
people aboard the Boeing 767 were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The crash occurred a day after a Kenya Airways jetliner plunged
into the ocean off the Ivory Coast, killing all but 10 of the 179
aboard.

BY STEVE CARNEY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ On the first day of classes Monday, hundreds of
California State University, Northridge, students discovered they
not only have to buy books, but must purchase $50 hand-held
computers so their teachers can give tests and take attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's required for us, and I'm not too happy about it,'' said
Elena Monroy, who found out she must buy the GradePlus device for
her biology class.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have trouble buying books, much less something
that's going to take my attendance,'' said Monroy, a 25-year-old
senior majoring in Chicano studies.
</P>
<P>
   The units are designed to save instructors' time, get students
their test results immediately and save possible errors that crop
up on standard computerized test sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Six instructors in the astronomy, physics and biology
departments at CSUN have begun using the devices in their classes.
About 800 students of the 28,000 enrolled at the university will be
affected.
</P>
<P>
   The battery-powered units are about the size of paperback novels
and have small screens and keyboards on which students can mark
answers to standardized tests. At the end of a class, they can push
a button and transmit their answers via an infrared beam to their
instructor's computer, which immediately returns their grades. The
units are personalized, so students can also press a button to
indicate that they're in class on any given day.
</P>
<P>
   And the devices are cheat-proof, because classmates can't see
answers on the screen, according to Bob Biedermann, president of
the manufacturer, Argus International of Dana Point, in Orange
County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the students use it, they really love it. They don't want
to go back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The units got a trial run in a CSUN astronomy class last
semester, and Biedermann said he is talking to the university's
business school about expanding it to classes there.
</P>
<P>
   The units were first tested at Golden West Community College in
Huntington Beach and California State University, San Bernardino,
last year, and are now also being used at San Diego State
University.
</P>
<P>
   Biedermann said his company is even talking to high schools and
grade schools about adopting the devices.
</P>
<P>
   Using the GradePlus, students will no longer have to worry about
filling in the circles correctly on the ubiquitous computer-scanned
test sheets, erasing erroneous marks completely or making sure they
have sharpened No.2 pencils lined up, because the old, finicky
scanners can't read other shades of graphite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'd buy No. 2 pencil stock,'' Biedermann said.
``If this would catch on around the country, it's going to change
the way a lot of things are done.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Kubler, a visiting professor of biology at CSUN, is using
the GradePluses in her Life in the Sea class. She said uploading
students' answers to her computer helps her track their progress,
and she can adjust grades and give credit after tests if she
determines that a question was too confusing flexibility not
available with other grading systems.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, by saving time required to grade tests, she can
give more quizzes. Students' grades improve when they're tested
more frequently, according to an Ohio State University study,
Kubler said.
</P>
<P>
   But she does sympathize with her students' tight budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the big drawback. Students have to pay for it and it's
not cheap,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With her biology textbook costing $114, and texts and materials
needed for other classes, Monroy said the GradePlus is just
something else on which students have to spend their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's rent, parking is $63 for a parking permit, and there
are all these other expenses. It's insane,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Biedermann said the units will become a better deal for
students as more classes use them.
</P>
<P>
   With campus bookstores buying back the units for half price when
students no longer need them, he said the cost effectively drops to
$25 less than the $28 the average student spends on computer bubble
sheets during a college career. And by eliminating the need for the
computer sheets, he said, the units also save paper.
</P>
<P>
   But dollar bills are the paper most students care about saving.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some people, they can't really afford their books,'' said
Heather Martin, 21, a sophomore majoring in economics and history.
</P>
<P>
   She still had to purchase computer sheets and blue books for
tests in her other classes Monday when she bought a GradePlus for
her astronomy class.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either get it or you go to another teacher,'' she said.

PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDERS DIFFER WIDELY ON GUN CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By PAMELA J. PODGER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Although the leading candidates for the White House from both major
parties are in broad agreement on most violent crime issues, the
differences between them on gun control could hardly be wider.
<P>
   From New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, a Democrat who is calling for
a national registry for all guns, to Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a
Republican who signed legislation allowing residents of his state
to carry concealed weapons in church, the candidates are finding
plenty to argue about.
</P>
<P>
   With national crime rates at a 25-year low, the issue of violent
crime in America is no longer a continental divide between
Republicans and Democrats. There is no disagreement, for example,
over efforts to toughen sentencing laws for incorrigible juveniles
or appointing judges who will enforce the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
the North Valley Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles and
Thurston High School in Springfield, Ore., have seared the public
psyche, making gun control more prominent in this year's White
House race than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The slayings have ``changed a situation where parents felt their
children were not threatened because they lived in a nice safe
suburb where the schools were controlled,'' said Phillip J. Cook, a
Duke University professor who has studied gun violence for 20
years. ``Now the schools are holding drills in case a mass shooting
breaks out or requiring that kids trade in their canvas backpacks
for transparent ones.''
</P>
<P>
   And voters, especially women and suburbanites, are taking a hard
look at the candidates' positions on handgun control.
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidates vow to uphold legitimate rights of gun
owners while calling for vigorous prosecution of miscreants and
juveniles who misuse guns. Democratic candidates tend to package
gun control with school safety and public health proposals as a way
to distance themselves from the GOP and broaden their appeal with
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, President Clinton upped the ante in his State of the
Union address when he urged states to issue photo ID licenses for
handgun purchases, much like licenses for driving or hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's initiative followed House refusal to act on a milder
gun control measure last year that passed the Senate, on a
tie-breaking vote by Vice President Al Gore, to close a loophole in
the Brady Bill by mandating a three-day waiting period on purchases
at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Hurriedly placed in a juvenile justice bill last spring after
the Columbine shooting, the Senate provisions also would have
required trigger locks on handguns, but the bill failed when House
Republicans complained that the measures were too strong.
</P>
<P>
   That series of votes has framed the tumultuous gun debate as the
presidential election approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley, his rival for the Democratic nomination,
support the provisions in the Senate version of the juvenile crime
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his main GOP challengers, Arizona Sen. John McCain and
publisher Steve Forbes, say gun manufacturers should be urged, but
not required, to sell a trigger lock with each gun. All three would
go along with instant background checks at gun shows but oppose
making the shows comply with the three-day waiting period.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's handgun licensing plan is very similar to a stronger
proposal already offered by Gore, who calls for making gun licenses
mandatory and requiring manufacturers and federally licensed
sellers to report gun sales to state authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has taken an even tougher stance by calling for a
national system for registration of all firearms, saying, ``If we
can register automobiles, we ought to be able to register
handguns.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the Republican candidates supports gun licensing or a
national registration system.
</P>
<P>
   Only 12 states have some form of handgun licensing. California
is not among them, but for years the state has had a 10-day waiting
period for the purchase of handguns and has checked the background
of potential gun buyers.
</P>
<P>
   California Gov. Gray Davis has signed legislation that requires
the sale of trigger locks with every gun and imposes safety
standards for handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats claim Bush is vulnerable on gun control, particularly
in states such as California, where a Field Poll in September found
that voters believe 2-to-1 that it is more important than the right
to own firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Bush signed two pieces of legislation in 1995 and 1997 allowing
Texans to carry concealed weapons in places of worship and other
public venues. His actions also limit Texas cities from suing gun
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George W. Bush is indeed the nominee, he is wrong on gun
control.'' said Garry South, senior political adviser to Davis and
an informal adviser to Gore. ``We will kill him on this issue,''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  But Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said the governor is not
out of step on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush recognizes that the problem is more than just laws.
It is about changing our culture and ushering in a responsibility
era and condemning acts of terror such as school shootings.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mark DiCamillo of the Field Poll said that despite the wide
support for gun control among California voters, the issue has more
importance in state and local campaign than in a presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to the big stage of the presidential race ...
single issues become less of a factor,'' DiCamillo said. ``Gun
control may be one area of incremental advantage for the Democrats
over the Republicans, but it is just that: an incremental
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, candidates from both parties fear being portrayed as
captive to extremists, both those who demand no restrictions on
handgun ownership and those who would melt down every firearm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates will try and position themselves to represent the
responsible middle,'' said Herb Asher, a political science
professor at Ohio State University. ``No one wants to take away gun
ownership _ that is a common, core belief. What we're really
talking about are the reasonable restrictions and regulations.''

ALASKA AIRLINES JET CRASHES INTO PACIFIC; 88 FEARED DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Edits and changes throughout.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ An Alaskan Airlines jetliner bound from Mexico to
Seattle plunged into the Pacific Ocean on Monday after encountering
mechanical problems near Los Angeles. All 88 people aboard, 50 of
them from the Seattle area, are feared dead.
</P>
<P>
   While families waited at airports here and in San Francisco,
Coast Guard boats, rescue helicopters and a Navy search plane
scoured the choppy waters for hours into the winter twilight and
long past darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers found several bodies but no survivors.
</P>
<P>
   At Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, a steady stream of
frantic people rushed to Alaska Airline's counter. Alaska employees
escorted them into a private ``family room'' on the mezzanine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably one of the most tragic days this airlines has
experienced,'' Jack Evans, an Alaska Airlines spokesman, said
Monday night. ``I think we're all in shock, just like everyone else
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-seven passengers and three flight attendants were from the
Seattle area. Three passengers were from Eugene, Ore. and another
from Fairbanks, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two passengers planned to get off the plane at San
Francisco. The two pilots were based in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday night, ticket agents for Alaska Airlines, who asked
not to be identified, said 10 employees of Alaska and 30 from
Horizon airlines were on the flight. Both airlines are owned by
Seattle-based Alaska Air Group.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, at 1:30 p.m. PST, the passengers and crew members
boarded Flight 261 in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. They were supposed
to fly to San Francisco, and arrive at Seattle at 8:25 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 p.m., the pilots made a routine check with air traffic
controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, between Santa Barbara, Calif., and Los
Angeles, the pilots reported they were having problems controlling
the MD-83, and were descending, according to Paul Schlamm, a
spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   They sent their last reported radio message to controllers at
4:17 p.m., Schlamm said.
</P>
<P>
   Flight controllers lost contact with the plane at 4:36,
according to an Alaska Airlines statement.
</P>
<P>
   The jet fell 17,000 feet from the sky and plunged into the
Pacific Ocean 20 miles northwest of Los Angeles International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   As word of the crash spread, fishing boats took off from the
Channel Islands Harbor, a popular tourist port for whale-watching,
fishing charters and island tours.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters equipped with heat-seeking infrared devices hovered
above the 58-degree waters of the crash site 12 miles off the
California coast, hoping to detect any survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to search for survivors until there's zero chance
of finding anybody from this tragedy alive,'' George Wright, a
Coast Guard captain from the Los Angeles area, said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen miracles happen in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Monday night, Evans said: ``Our No. 1
priority right now is to take care of friends and family of the
passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   The MD-83 was last serviced Sunday and received two regularly
scheduled checks during the year, Evans, the airlines spokesman,
said. It was manufactured in 1992, and was plane number 963.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier conducted the most comprehensive check, a C check,
on Jan. 13, 1999. There are four levels of checks, A through D,
with D being the most thorough.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-80 series has been at the center of a criminal
investigation into Alaska Airlines maintenance and a long-running
controversy over fumes in the passenger cabin.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was prompted by John Liotine, an Alaska lead
mechanic in Oakland, Calif., who complained that an Alaska
supervisor filled out a post-maintenance checklist on an MD-80 even
though he was not qualified to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska repairs its 35 MD-80s at the Oakland maintenance
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines has grown over its 65-year history from a single
three-passenger plane chugging over the tundra to the nation's
10th-biggest carrier, as ranked by Aviation Daily, which closely
monitors the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The smiling, crinkly-eyed Eskimo whose likeness adorns the tails
of the airline's 89 jets is a familiar sight on tarmacs up and down
the West Coast, where Alaska is the dominant carrier between the
Pacific Northwest and California.
</P>
<P>
   The airline carried 13.1 million passengers in 1998 and now
serves 41 cities in the United States, Mexico and Canada. With more
than 9,200 employees and 1999 sales of $2.08 billion, the airline
is one of the biggest businesses here.
</P>
<P>
   While it has faced criticism and sanctions from the Federal
Aviation Administration for maintenance practices, the airline had
not had a fatal crash in more than 25 years until Monday and is a
perennial favorite in customer satisfaction surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until today it was probably the best domestic record in the
industry,'' Jon Proctor, editor of Airliners magazine, said Monday.
``Twenty-four years since a fatal accident. That's a long time in
today's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, federal officials dispatched investigative teams.
The NTSB sent experts, a ``Go Team,'' early Tuesday morning.
Richard Rodriguez, who has spent nearly 40 years working on air
safety investigations, was named as its investigator-in-charge.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said it was sending its own experts.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board was also sending experts to aid families of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not yet know and cannot speculate about what happened to
Flight 261,'' said Alaska chief executive officer John Kelly, in a
prepared statement released Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was the third fatal accident for Alaska Airlines in 29
years and the first since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 4, 1971, an Alaska Boeing 727 crashed into a
mountainside as it was preparing to land in Juneau, Alaska. All 111
people on board were killed.
</P>
<P>
   On April 5, 1976, another Alaska 727 slid off the runway in
Ketchikan, Alaska. One passenger was killed. Several passengers and
crew members were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-83 is an updated version of the MD-80, built by McDonnell
Douglas at Long Beach, Calif. The model first entered service in
1980. Derived from the DC-9, it carries 144 to 152 passengers and
is distinctive for its two engines mounted on the rear of the
fuselage and its high tail section or horizontal stabilizer. There
were 1,191 MD-80, -82 and -83 models made.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, which bought McDonnell Douglas in 1997, ended production
of the MD-80 series last year.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft involved in Monday afternoon's crash had logged
26,584 hours of flight time and had taken off and landed 14,315
times. It was equipped with JT8D Pratt and Whitney engines.

IN WAKE OF CRASH, GRIEF AND DESPERATION AT SAN
FRANCISCO  INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By JAXON VAN DERBEKEN,  
 BILL WORKMAN, MARSHALL WILSON  
 and SUSAN SWARD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO _ Susan da Silva, whose husband was on
Alaska Airlines Flight 261, had one question when she rushed to San
Francisco International Airport Monday after learning the plane had
crashed: Had anyone survived?
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from the VIP lounge at the international terminal, the
49-year-old Bank of America employee said the official briefings
had not given her the answers she needed about her husband, Dean
Forshee of Benicia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know if they find any people,'' said da Silva. ``I
want to know if they find people in the water. I can't believe he's
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy that swept up da Silva affected scores of relatives,
friends and grief counselors who descended on the airport after
news of the crash broke. Inside the VIP lounge, clergy talked with
family members away from the glare of the television cameras and
the stares of bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very quiet in there,'' said airport spokesman Ron Wilson.
``There's a couple of people who are sobbing. We have about 12 to
14 clergy in there talking to them. They are grief counselors, but
they are always trying to maintain some sense there is some hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Yosef Langer of Chabad House in San Francisco, one of the
counselors, said, ``I just want to go in and help these people. I
try to first let them know that this world is the halfway station
and that the soul lives on. That it what is important.''
</P>
<P>
   As the search continued at the crash site off the Southern
California coast, desperate relatives and friends sought without
success to learn the fate of their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my mother is on that flight. I'm pretty darn sure,'' a
teary-eyed Richard Smith said of his mother, Joan Smith, as he
emerged from the lounge.
</P>
<P>
   Radio station KSFO said it was trying to determine whether one
of its talk-show hosts, Cynthia Oti, had been on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Oti, who gives financial advice to her listeners, was on
vacation in Mexico over the weekend and had planned to be on Flight
261, said Jack Swanson, program director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cynthia is, if anything, a practical person, and it would have
been odd that she would have planned to be on the radio only two
hours after her flight arrived,'' Swanson said. ``All of us here at
KSFO are praying she missed the flight and is having a cool drink
on a warm beach.''
</P>
<P>
   For da Silva, the day turned to one of horror when she got a
page from her daughter and raced to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and neighbors said da Silva and Forshee were a warm,
friendly couple who moved a few months ago from San Francisco
suburb Concord to nearby Benicia.
</P>
<P>
   John Jegi, who lived near the couple in Concord, said the
47-year-old Forshee was a guitarist who played with pick-up bands
around the Bay Area. He grew his own hops in the backyard and
brewed his own beer from the hops. And he loved jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the kind of person who really will be missed,'' Jegi
said.
</P>
<P>
   New neighbors in Benicia also liked the couple, whose new home
was on a hill overlooking the Carquinez Strait. About a month ago,
the couple invited the whole neighborhood over for an open house.
</P>
<P>
   Forshee had traveled to Puerto Vallarta for a vacation at the
family's condominium. Da Silva stayed behind because she was busy
in her job in the systems division of Bank of America. The family's
condo was in an area she described as a paradise _ Rincon de
Guayabitos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's been happy during the couple of weeks he's been
down there,'' she said. ``I'm kind of numb.''
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Estrada, 22, from Union City, drives a forklift on the
night shift at Home Depot. He was visiting his parents in Puerto
Vallarta with his brother, Robert, 18, and was to have been on
Flight 261, but had to get back to work and caught an earlier
flight.
</P>
<P>
   He barely had time to consider his good fortune regarding Flight
261 before realizing that his brother was probably on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just remember being on my knees, my mom giving me (a sign
of) the cross as I left the house today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But their 23-year-old sister, Lorena Baron, looking at Robert's
itinerary, was not convinced he was on the flight. She called
Alaska Airlines, which said he had, indeed, been aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she insisted they check again, and they did. No, the
airline finally said, Robert Estrada was not on Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
   It was business as usual at Alaska Airlines ticket counters. But
many of the agents had red, watery eyes from crying. One ticket
agent, who declined to give her name, said, ``It's been very
difficult, but we're all doing our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sloan, who had been scheduled to catch Flight 261 when it
continued on from San Francisco to Seattle, said that when news
about the crash was announced at the airport, ``several women fell
to their knees and started praying.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan herself said she was swept up by what she described as an
``out-out-of-body experience. I feel so sorry for people on the
plane.''

PRIMARY CONCERN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE: CHARACTER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ From the hardscrabble farms and rugged slopes
near New Hampshire's Canadian border to the snow-covered hamlets
and high-tech office parks in the south, there is an unmistakable
theme to the opening of the 2000 presidential campaign:
</P>
<P>
   Character counts.
</P>
<P>
   You hear it from candidates in stump speeches, and television
commercials that blanket the airwaves. You hear it from volunteers
holding placards, and voters who are hardly paying attention to
Tuesday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is reaction to the scandals of the Clinton White
House or simply the easiest way to distinguish between a group of
similar candidates, ``Character is  &UR; the  &LR; dominant issue in New
Hampshire,'' said state GOP Chairman Steve Duprey.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the voters of New Hampshire have a chance to shape the
field before the national spotlight shifts to California and 15
other states that will hold primaries March 7.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, the debate already has been framed. With the
economy booming and the nation at peace, distinctions between each
candidate's plan for tax reform or health coverage are not as
crucial as leadership style and personal integrity.
</P>
<P>
   And so Sen. John McCain campaigns as a guy who will ``tell you
the truth no matter what.'' Former Sen. Bill Bradley pushes a ``new
kind of politics.'' Vice President Al Gore tells crowds he is
someone who will ``stand and fight.'' And the biggest applause line
Texas Gov. George Bush receives in his stump speech comes when he
says that if elected, ``I will swear to uphold not only the laws of
the land, but also the dignity and honor of the presidency, so help
me God.''
</P>
<P>
   Disputes over policy matters will become more important in the
November election, when fundamental differences between Democrats
and Republicans on tax cuts, gun control, abortion and spending
programs are sharpened. But for all the energy that Gore and
Bradley have devoted to explaining their health plans, and Bush and
McCain have spent on their tax cuts, interviews with scores of
voters found almost none who could identify the differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know why I like John McCain _ because he's a stand-up
guy,'' said John Gill, a 52-year-old pilot from Nashua who drove an
hour to see the senator at a rally Monday in Concord.
</P>
<P>
   ``My youngest son is a Marine, and I want someone as commander
in chief who knows where he's sending people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lawrence, the proprietor at Bryant &AMP; Lawrence Hardware in
Tilton, a community in the foothills of the White Mountains, said
he is voting for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are so similar in so many ways, but Bill's a little
bit of an outsider. I like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The final pre-election polls show Gore with a narrow edge over
Bradley, and McCain with a slightly more comfortable lead over
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But conversations with New Hampshirites suggest that the most
intense loyalty is toward Bradley and McCain _ with many voters
expressing a visceral distaste for each party's front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the choice were between Al Gore and my dog, I'd vote for my
dog,'' said Gill.
</P>
<P>
   The Manchester Union Leader _ the state's most influential paper
_ has led a crusade against Bush, lambasting him in an editorial
Monday headlined ``Is Bush a loser?''
</P>
<P>
   Strategists say the key to today's outcome will be the turnout
of independents.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one issue that has approached character as a focal
point in New Hampshire, it is electability. Republicans are
yearning for someone who can reclaim the White House, and many
party loyalists believe Bush is their best shot. Democratic
insiders favor Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But 40 percent of the electorate consists of voters who have
registered with neither party. And McCain and Bradley's chances are
improved if independents vote in high numbers.
</P>
<P>
   To display their character in the 2000 campaign, candidates have
universally decried the use of ``negative attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, television commercials by Steve Forbes and Pat
Buchanan used such ominous music that some voters threatened to
take their televisions out back and shoot them.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in stark contrast, the commercials are filled with
soft, friendly music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like him,'' says a voter in one Forbes' commercial. ``I like
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The potency of ``negative attacks'' is so strong that when one
group began running ads warning that Forbes might start running
negative ads, Forbes decried the commercials as negative attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most pointed exchanges on issues have been couched in
terms of what they say about character. When Bradley began to
attack Gore's votes as a member of the House 15 years ago as being
anti-choice, his biggest complaint was the Gore was being dishonest
by not admitting it.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic moment on the campaign trail Monday followed
one candidate's appeal to those voting for character.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I don't flip-flop on the issue,'' declared Republican
Gary Bauer, participating in a Manchester pancake flip-off between
candidates. As Bauer flipped his pancake in the air, he moved two
steps backward and promptly fell off the stage. He returned a
second later, apparently unhurt.

 ANYONE CAN RECOGNIZE GREAT ART  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mediocre art, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Doggie Diner head is being called by its
detractors, who probably buy their art at ``Famous Paintings by the
Pound.''
</P>
<P>
   The head's creator might be insulted, but nobody knows who he or
she is. Al Ross, who invented the Doggie Diner and now lives in the
desert in Southern California, says he has no idea who executed the
head's design. An advertising agency was involved, and probably
more than one artist.
</P>
<P>
   In defense of their work of art, may I ask if anyone else has
noticed the eerie similarity between the Doggie head and Da Vinci's
portrait of the Mona Lisa?
</P>
<P>
   Same mysterious, enigmatic smile. Same serene, knowing demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember anyone calling the Mona Lisa mediocre. Most
critics rate it well above average.
</P>
<P>
   The Doggie head is executed in the classic style of famous 16th
century portraits of guys with long noses and funny hats. And
nobody is tearing down the galleries where those paintings hang in
order to make room for a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   WHO WANTS TO BE a billionaire?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the SoCal branch of Gordon Getty's family.
</P>
<P>
   Getty, the famed San Francisco philanthropist, society figure,
opera composer and family man, admitted last August that he has a
second family in Los Angeles, with three daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Now the daughters and their mother have officially changed their
name to Getty, which should save them the hassle of showing ID when
they cash checks.
</P>
<P>
   The name change, some say, could be a move to secure inheritance
rights, since Getty is worth about $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the four SoCal Getty gals said, ``We're going to
keep it low-key.''
</P>
<P>
   Good luck.
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKING OF extended family, the Doggie Diner head has brothers
and/or sisters all over the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   The head on a stick on Sloat Ave. is the only Doggie head still
presiding over a burger joint, but there are several other heads
spreading their magic.
</P>
<P>
   The Streetlight New and Used Records store in San Jose has a
head in a corner of the store. There are two or three in
Emeryville, one in Contra Costa County, one at an Anderson Valley
ranch called Sheep Dung Estates and one sitting under an oak tree
at the Noceto Winery in the Shenandoah Valley in Amador County.
</P>
<P>
   Winery co-owner Jim Gullett bought the head about 13 years ago
at an auction at his child's preschool in Walnut Creek _ for $300.
Jim says he has fond memories of the diner, but not of the food.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Doggie Diner on California,'' he says, ``I broke my
tooth on a hamburger.''
</P>
<P>
   LAUGHING SAL is not stored away somewhere, as misnoted here
recently.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanical greeter from the old Playland by the Beach has
simply moved to a different beach. She is working the room at the
Musee Mechanique at the Cliff House.
</P>
<P>
   SAN LOOIE in a stewie:
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are touting their ``pitch relay,'' where they pass
one baseball around the state, fans get to throw it, and it will be
used at the opening day ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' radio commercial says something to the effect of
``San Looie Obispo will get its chance,'' and that doesn't play
well down in San LUIS Obispo.
</P>
<P>
   Reports new San Luisian Jeff Bliss, ``In the short time I've
lived here, I've observed that nothing gets the citizens' dander up
like calling it San LOOIE.''
</P>
<P>
   IS OLD STEVE Young married?
</P>
<P>
   Eagle-eyed Super Bowl watchers Pat and Nichole Baker say they
spotted what looked like a wedding ring on Steve Young's finger
Sunday when he was doing color commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says my secret source. That ring is kind of an
engagement ring.
</P>
<P>
   When is the big day? None of your (or my) business.
</P>
<P>
   MUSINGS HERE on how bird droppings now dominate Seal Rocks,
since the sea lions moved to Pier 39, reminded Tony Arnold of a
Yale classmate 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The kid's dad made a fortune harvesting guano from offshore
seabird-roost rocks. He increased the yield by scaring the poop out
of the birds by using dynamite, steamboat whistles and other
sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The kid's senior thesis was ``Instruments to Implement the
Increment of Excrement.''
</P>
<P>
   Excellent.

GRIEVING FAMILIES AWAIT WORD OF LOVED ONES ABOARD FLIGHT 261 
</HEADLINE>
   (New material, edits throughout.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VANESSA HO  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ They were supposed to embrace loved ones stepping off
the plane, many of whom would probably be tan and happy after a
vacation in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they rushed into Seattle-Tacoma International Airport
in tears after learning that Alaska Airlines Flight 261 had crashed
into the Pacific Ocean on Monday, about 20 miles off the California
coast near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   As a stream of frantic people made their way to Alaska's counter
Monday night, employees escorted them into a private ``family
room'' with counselors and clergy on the second-floor mezzanine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my sister is on that flight,'' said one man. Other
people came in holding hands and holding back tears.
</P>
<P>
   One young woman, crying hysterically, said her mother is a
Seattle-based Alaska Airlines attendant who was on a flight in
Mexico on Monday. But she did not know which flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably one of the most tragic days this airline has
experienced,'' said Jack Evans, Alaska Airlines spokesman. ``I
think we're all in shock, just like everyone else is.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-three passengers and five crew members had been on board
Flight 261. Forty-seven of the passengers had been booked to
Seattle, and three crew members were from Seattle. The two pilots
were from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska employees said Monday night that 30 of those on board
either worked for Horizon Air and its parent company, Alaska
Airlines, or were friends or family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thoughts and our prayers at this moment are for our
passengers and fellow employees and for their families, friends and
loved ones. To all I extend my personal and profound sorrow for
what has transpired,'' Alaska Airlines Chief Executive Officer John
Kelly said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In the private room, a specially trained team of Alaska's
employees provided care, support and food and set up a hot line for
family members. The number is 1-800-553-5117.
</P>
<P>
   Chaplain John Oas said the mood in the room was somber. He said
about a dozen family members and a dozen employees and friends
whispered in hushed tones and hugged one another.
</P>
<P>
   He said people were grieving, but still held hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say there is always (hope) holding out in the human
heart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynnette Arnold and Jeff Peterson, both of Federal Way, Wash.,
were two of many people of faith who arrived to provide support.
Arnold said she was at home when she heard the news on television.
She called Peterson, who attends her church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just shocked,'' she said, while waiting by the ticket
counter. ``The spirit of God came on and said get down to the
airport right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Maynard Sargent of the Salvation Army, a King James Bible
in hand, also arrived to help. And nine people with the American
Red Cross were providing support.
</P>
<P>
   The crash shook up Alaska's employees, and some attendants cried
during their flights into Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Pilot Scott Borden had flown Flight 261 the day before
and was getting ready for a flight to California on Monday night.
``It brought it home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was thinking of what he would tell his upcoming passengers.
``Hopefully I can come up with some comforting words,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A flight attendant who was part of Alaska's critical incident
response team was debriefing all crew members who arrived at
Sea-Tac. The attendant, who didn't want to be named, knew the
crewmembers aboard Flight 261, but declined to discuss them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just making sure the crews are OK,'' he said, adding
that 1,200 of Alaska's 2,000 flight attendants live in Seattle.
``We all know everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   At Gate C9, where Alaska Flight 237 had arrived from Puerta
Vallarta, passengers and families sobbed at their brush with fate.
A girls' gymnastics team from Auburn, Wash., was on the plane, and
many parents had waited anxiously most of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Bollinger grabbed her daughter when she saw her and said,
``I'm going to nail her feet to the terra firma for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Moore, whose 14-year-old daughter Savannah was on Flight
237, felt nauseous until she saw her daughter's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts go out to the people who won't see their families
tonight,'' she said. Savannah said passengers were not told of the
plane crash. She thought a celebrity was on board when she saw the
TV cameras at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   At a different gate, where another flight from Puerto Vallarta
was arriving, Renea Zosel was waiting for her mother and brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just for a few seconds, the world ended,'' she said. ``When
it's close to home, I feel sick for everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Los Angeles leg of that flight, Pedro Orozco said the
captain yelled at the passengers and told them not to ask any
questions about the crash. ``It was really creepy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Alaska's other flights were delayed, but much of the
airport _ other than the private grieving room _ appeared to be
doing business as usual. In one bar, the TV was trained on sports,
not on the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate, but it's not going to stop me from flying,''
said one airport employee. ``It's still safer to fly than drive.''
</P>
<P>
   P-I reporters Judd Slivka, Candy Hatcher, Tracy Johnson, Heath
Foster and Lisa Stiffler contributed to this report.

<P>
   OXNARD, Calif. _ Minutes after reporting mechanical problems
Monday, an Alaska Airlines jet with 88 people aboard plunged
nose-first into the Pacific Ocean off Point Mugu. There were no
signs of survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261, en route nonstop from the Mexican resort of Puerto
Vallarta to San Francisco and then on to Seattle, disappeared from
radar around 3:45 p.m. after its crew reported problems with the
stabilizer trim on the MD-83 jetliner and asked permission to make
an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   On Anacapa Island, a witness saw the plane plummet into the
Pacific Ocean about 9 miles off the coast.
</P>
<P>
   A broad oil slick littered with debris marked the crash scene.
At least one body was recovered, with unconfirmed reports placing
the number at seven.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard and Navy ships and helicopters, aided by the boats
of Channel Island fishermen, searched the cold and choppy water
through the night, bringing pieces of wreckage back to shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every resource we can muster either on-scene or en
route,'' said Coast Guard Capt. George Wright. ``We are going to
search for survivors until there is about zero chance of finding
anyone alive.''
</P>
<P>
   As darkness fell, the Coast Guard's four helicopters, one
airplane and three boats on the scene were joined by more than a
dozen civilian boats combing the water for survivors. Coast Guard
personnel were armed with infrared vision devices to spot the body
heat of survivors floating on the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always hope there will be a survivor out there,''
Wright said. ``We've seen miracles before.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the 58-degree water temperature, however, officials said
it was unlikely people could survive for long.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration officials and a National
Transportation Safety Board spokesman said an investigative team
was immediately mobilized and was expected to arrive in Los Angeles
early today. The team will lead recovery efforts and seek the cause
of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   An Alaska Airlines spokesman said the plane, built by McDonnell
Douglas, now a division of Boeing, had no previous problems with
the stabilizer trim, which automatically balances the aircraft
during slight upward and downward movements.
</P>
<P>
   The flight left Puerto Vallarta at 2:30 p.m. Pacific time and
was scheduled to land in San Francisco just after 5 p.m. before
heading on to Seattle later in the evening. Eighty-three passengers
and five crew members were on board, according to the airline.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two passengers were bound for San Francisco, according to
the airline. An additional 47 were headed on to Seattle, three were
going to Eugene, Ore., and one was headed to Fairbanks, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic controllers lost contact with the crew over Los
Angeles air space as the plane cruised up the coast at 17,000 feet,
said a spokesman for San Francisco International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials said the crew members radioed that they were
having trouble with the stabilizer trim and were diverted back to
LAX.
</P>
<P>
   The jet was still 20 miles northwest of the airport when it
crashed, plunging into water at least 300 feet deep. There were
conflicting reports about the time of the crash. The Federal
Aviation Administration reported that the plane disappeared from
radar about 3:45 p.m. The initial report of a crash reached the
Coast Guard around 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   On Anacapa Island, roughly two miles away from the crash, a
National Park Service employee watched the plane slam into the
ocean, said Suzan Smith, a spokeswoman for Channel Islands National
Park in Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went in nose first,'' she said. She declined to identify
the employee.
</P>
<P>
   The plane hit just outside the park's boundaries, she said. The
employee called in the crash to the park's dispatch center, which
called the Coast Guard with the information. The park's dispatchers
also reached a fishing boat crew that had witnessed the crash and
was rushing to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokesman Mitch Barker said the first reports of the crash
indicated the plane was upside down in the water. Further details
were not available Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The twin-engine plane was built in 1992 and is a version of the
MD-80 first flown in 1979. Since then McDonnell Douglas, and now
Boeing, has sold nearly 1,200 of the MD-80s in various versions.
</P>
<P>
   A passenger list was not available Monday evening. However,
those who think family members may have been on the plane can call
(800) 553-5117 to reach the airline.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross of Greater Los Angeles deployed a team to
LAX to provide grief counseling to relatives of passengers and crew
members who live in the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteer air team includes mental health workers, an
administrator and logistics workers to provide food and shelter. At
LAX, a handful of relatives of passengers and crew members were
eligible to take advantage of the grief counseling, a spokesperson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The news stunned other travelers at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines passenger Mercedes Pearlta of Modesto called
home as soon as she landed at LAX for a stopover and found out
about the crash. She said her son and his friends were watching the
news unfold on television and were trying to determine what
happened to Pearlta, who was flying home from a trip to Mazatlan.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son was just panicked,'' said Pearlta, teary-eyed but still
determined to catch her next flight to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just relieved but I'm really scared,'' she said. ``I want
to get home.''

   For Black History month, which begins on Monday, Feb. 1, The New
York times Syndicate is offering a five-part feature, ``The
Caldwell Journals,'' an account of major moments in the
civil-rights movement of the 1960s by Earl Caldwell, the nationally
acclaimed black journalist whose early career was shaped by that
dynamic era.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell, a former New York Times reporter, was witness to some
of the most important events of the last 40 years. He covered the
riots that swept many American cities during the summer of 1967.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the National Association of Black Journalists presented
Caldwell with its President's Award, saying his record of
professional achievement made him ``one of the most important
journalists in the last 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell is currently a writer-in-residence at the Robert C.
Maynard Institute for Journalism Education in Oakland, Calif., and
is writing ``The Caldwell Journals'' for the institute's Web site.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Caldwell Journals have been sent to the ``l'' lifestyle and
``a'' general news category codes.

<P>
   &UR; PART 1: THE BOLL WEEVIL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Earl Caldwell starts work at The Democrat and
Chronicle, in Rochester, N.Y. About his first assignment, Caldwell
writes, ``The story was boxed across the top of the front page of
the Sunday edition. It was even before the masthead.'' Caldwell and
another reporter _ a white journalist named Bill Vogler _ are sent
out into the streets of Rochester to cover the segregation that
exists in housing. Their experiences are startlingly different. ``I
would just reach the door and promptly be told, `The apartment has
already been rented,''' Caldwell writes. ``Right after I was told
that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the same place
and be invited inside.'' The community's reaction to the resulting
story was overwhelmingly positive _ particularly among blacks, who
nicknamed Caldwell the boll weevil, which came from the title of a
then-popular song. ``When they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, `Here comes that boll weevil. He's still looking for a
home,''' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 2: HARLEM _ THE COLONY CONVERGES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Caldwell recounts the riots in Harlem that came
about in July 1964, after a white cop had shot and killed a black
youth. ``I grabbed a notebook and a few clothes and headed for the
airport, hoping that my experience in Rochester had prepared me for
the challenge ahead in the Big Apple,'' he writes. Crowds of blacks
lined the streets _ screaming, jeering, ducking. ``I was at least
as astonished as the police and the blacks on the streets to see a
dozen or so reporters, all black like me, representing large and
powerful organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated
Press, the New York Post ... Time magazine. ... We acknowledged
with one another the bit of history of which we were a part.''
Something very great is happening and Caldwell and his black
colleagues are at the center of it. The doors have opened.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 3: MALCOLM X &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In February 1965, Malcolm X accepts an invitation to address a
black church in Rochester. Despite speculation that the speech will
be canceled, he arrives on Feb. 16. Caldwell recounts Malcolm X's
moving speech. However, through most of the hour, the civil-rights
activist cites example after example of how the press is used
against black people. People stand up and shout their approval.
Caldwell realizes that he can't go to Malcolm X's hotel later with
the others. Caldwell fears the meeting will be a ``get the press''
session. Five days later, on Feb. 21, Caldwell is at work at his
newspaper when the shocking news hits the headlines: Malcolm X was
killed just as he started to deliver a speech at the Audubon
Ballroom in Harlem. ``For me, the lesson driven home was that a
reporter's job required toughness and that journalism was not the
place for the easily embarrassed or intimidated,'' Caldwell writes.
``I had missed my chance to meet and talk with Malcolm X. I vowed
never to make a similar mistake again.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 4: WHITE REPORTERS OUT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Harlem on the Sunday that Malcolm X is shot, two reporters
are right up in front in the Audubon Ballroom, so close to the
podium that when the shooting starts, they have to dive to the
floor for cover. The journalists: Stan Scott and Gene Simpson. How
they got into the ballroom that afternoon played large part in
ushering in a whole new era for reporters who are black. This is
their story.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PART 5: BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this excerpt, Caldwell is now working for the Herald Tribune
and is witnessing what he calls ``the black consciousness
movement.'' Editors want reporters to literally camp out in Harlem
and the other black areas of the city to report and write about
what is taking place. Caldwell gets the assignment and is
overwhelmed by what he witnesses. ``A massive redefinition of self
was taking place in the ghettos,'' he writes. ``Very little went
unchallenged. And at the core was an unprecedented embracing of
blackness.''

   In this excerpt, Earl Caldwell starts work at The Democrat and
Chronicle, in Rochester, N.Y. About his first assignment, Caldwell
writes, ``The story was boxed across the top of the front page of
the Sunday edition. It was even before the masthead.'' Caldwell and
another reporter _ a white journalist named Bill Vogler _ are sent
out into the streets of Rochester to cover the segregation that
exists in housing. Their experiences are startlingly different. ``I
would just reach the door and promptly be told, `The apartment has
already been rented,''' Caldwell writes. ``Right after I was told
that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the same place
and be invited inside.'' The community's reaction to the resulting
story was overwhelmingly positive _ particularly among blacks, who
nicknamed Caldwell the boll weevil, which came from the title of a
then-popular song. ``When they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, `Here comes that boll weevil. He's still looking for a

youth. ``I grabbed a notebook and a few clothes and headed for the
airport, hoping that my experience in Rochester had prepared me for
the challenge ahead in the Big Apple,'' he writes. Crowds of blacks
lined the streets _ screaming, jeering, ducking. ``I was at least
as astonished as the police and the blacks on the streets to see a
dozen or so reporters, all black like me, representing large and
powerful organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated
Press, the New York Post ... Time magazine. ... We acknowledged
with one another the bit of history of which we were a part.''
Something very great is happening and Caldwell and his black

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART ONE: In August 1963, tensions between blacks and
whites in many cities across the United States were on the rise.
Crowds converged on the nation's capital for the historic March on
Washington. Earl Caldwell, then a reporter for the Lancaster
Intelligencer-Journal, joined his parents in the living room of
their home in central Pennsylvania to watch Martin Luther King Jr.
deliver what many call his finest speech. Ten days later, a bomb
exploded during Sunday services at a black church in Birmingham,
Ala., killing four girls. Across urban America, black populations
became restless, and newspaper editors began searching for
reporters who could get inside the ``ghettos'' to gather stories
from those black communities. The Democrat and Chronicle in
Rochester, N.Y., began to recruit Caldwell aggressively. In the
fall of 1963, he accepted the job. Here, Caldwell recounts his
first assignment for the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The story was boxed across the top of the front page of the
Sunday edition. It was even above the masthead. Of all the stories
I had ever written, nothing came close to this, my first story as a
reporter at the Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the story herald my arrival, but there was also a
photograph of me, which was a way of letting readers know that for
the first time the newspaper had a reporter who was black.
</P>
<P>
   I'd arrived in town expecting the newspaper to make good on a
promise. Back when they were wooing me, I was told that if I
accepted the job, they would have an apartment waiting in a luxury
building not far from the newspaper. When I got to town and
mentioned all of this, I got a blank stare. Nobody knew what I was
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Dick Dougherty came up with his idea. He was the city
editor, and on my first day at the D&AMP;C, he told me that of all the
complaints that he was getting from blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the housing here is really segregated,'' he said. ``I
don't know if that's true or not. You have to find an apartment. We
don't need to phony up anything. We can use your experience to tell
a true story of what the situation really is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you do it?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty was a tall, thin guy whose hair was white even though
he didn't look to be a day past 35. His style was low key but very
persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   I had never reported and written a story about race, and what
Dougherty was suggesting caught me off-guard. But I was just
starting out on a new job; there was no way I was going to say no
to my city editor.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty wanted two reporters on the story _ one white and one
black. The plan was for each of us to try separately to rent the
same apartment. The white reporter was Bill Vogler. He was a
veteran on the staff at the D&AMP;C and he liked the idea. The two of
us got newspapers and circled apartments in my price range. Then we
got started.
</P>
<P>
   After we had visited about five or six apartments, Vogler asked
me, ``Are you sure you're actually going into these places?''
</P>
<P>
   He did not understand. I would just reach the door and promptly
be told, ``The apartment has already been rented.'' Right after I
was told that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the
same place and be invited inside. He'd get a whole spiel on how
great the apartment was, why he'd like it and what the neighborhood
had to offer.
</P>
<P>
   My experience was so different that at times it would be
downright embarrassing. One building had a big sign on the lawn,
Apartment for Rent. I was heading up the sidewalk when a window on
the second floor opened. A woman leaned out and hollered: ``If
you're coming for the apartment, forget it. It's already rented.''
</P>
<P>
   Once I explained all this to Vogler, we kept going. We visited
apartment after apartment. It was always the same: no to me, yes to
him. I just kept making notes of everything that happened. At the
typewriter, I got my chance to tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the story was published, blacks began showing up
in the newsroom ``to meet Earl Caldwell.'' Some would barge right
past the receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   These were not ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Some people called these visitors troublemakers. They called
themselves activists, which meant they were in the forefront of
stoking, shaping and channeling the anger they said was growing in
Rochester's two black communities, the Third and Seventh wards.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper itself was a target of their anger. They said they
never saw reporters in their neighborhoods ``except when there's
trouble'' and accused the newspaper of not covering the important
issues in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   They looked to me to change that. They said that they expected
to see me in their communities, to tell the stories that were not
being told. The irony was that in a sense, my editor and the
activists were saying the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find out what the facts are,'' Dougherty had
challenged me. ``We expect you to tell the story,'' the activists
said, inviting me to the ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   I was being handed what every reporter wants: a big and
important story.
</P>
<P>
   The front-page story of my experience in hunting an apartment
had given me the kind of notoriety that a reporter new in town
could only dream of. The reaction was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Once the story was published, so many whites called to offer an
apartment that I had to write another piece just to tell that
story. One very nice woman, also white, did rent me a place not far
from the office.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I had settled in, black folks still hung a nickname
on me. They called me boll weevil. The name came from the title of
a popular song, and when they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, ``Here comes boll weevil. He's still looking for a
home.'''

   PRELUDE TO PART TWO: On a hot night in Harlem in July 1964, the
explosion came. After a white police officer had shot and killed a
black youth, riots erupted in the black neighborhoods in the
northeast _ a portent of what was to come. At the Democrat and
Chronicle, the city editor called Earl Caldwell to his desk. ``We
want you to go down to Harlem,'' he said. Although Caldwell had
visited New York, he had never been to Harlem. He grabbed a
notebook and a few clothes and headed for the airport, hoping that
his experience in Rochester had prepared him for the challenge in
New York City. Here, Caldwell describes what it was like for him
and other black reporters in Harlem during the riots, which raged
around them for three nights.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The rioting in Harlem came in furious bursts. Rocks and bottles
sailed from tenement roofs. Molotov cocktails exploded on streets
littered with broken glass.

   Cops fired salvo after salvo into smoky, pitch-black skies.
Police cruisers, sirens wailing, roared in pursuit of hit-and-run
looters.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds lined the streets, sometimes as many as a thousand
people, all of them black. They screamed, jeered, ducked, dodged
and _ when turned on by riot-weary cops _ scrambled and ran.
</P>
<P>
   And there we were, smack in the middle of it, with notebooks in
hand, dashing at the heels of the crowds, observing the battles and
trying as best we could to record it all.
</P>
<P>
   Frenzied as it was in those moments of battle, that's all they
were, moments. They would rise like a storm and then, just as
suddenly, dissipate. And with every inevitable lull in the action,
attention turned to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' people demanded. Some would reach for the press
credentials that dangled from our necks.
</P>
<P>
   We tried to explain ourselves. ``We're press,'' we said. But
that was not nearly explanation enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``What press?'' our inquisitors fired back.
</P>
<P>
   In that back-and-forth, something that even we had not realized
came into focus. Harlem cops and black residents had seen black
reporters before. But almost without exception those reporters
worked for black newspapers, mainly weeklies. This time we
represented mainstream white-owned daily newspapers and radio
stations, a major first.
</P>
<P>
   A small colony of reporters who were black had arrived in the
big leagues of New York City journalism. And this took everyone by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Having come from Rochester, I was as astonished as the police
and the blacks on the streets to see at least a dozen or so
reporters, all black like me, representing large and powerful
organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated Press, the
New York Post, the Daily News, United Press International, Newsday,
and Newsweek and Time magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In that week, I came to know reporters such as Gerald Fraser,
Austin Scott, Ted Poston, Tom Johnson, Les Carson, Claude Lewis,
Ted Jones, Junius Griffin, Wally Terry, Paul Hathaway, Gene Simpson
and Stan Scott.
</P>
<P>
   And on the streets of Harlem, between bursts of rioting, we
acknowledged with one another that we were a part of a bit of
history.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just that we were there. What was developing into one
of the biggest stories in America was largely in our hands. The
events unfolding on the streets of Harlem would make news all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been little more than a mere footnote but it was
still a piece of history in the making. Never had the major media
put so much of an important story in the hands of reporters who
were not white.
</P>
<P>
   Every chance they got, the cops would stare us down. It was as
though they could not accept that we were qualified and that our
reporting would be central to what people everywhere would read of
the Harlem riots.
</P>
<P>
   Some white reporters sought us out. They would shake our hands
and stay as close to us as possible. That put them closer to the
story. It also made them feel safer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a white New York Times photographer was jumped by a mob
and beaten so badly that the bones around his eyes were broken.
</P>
<P>
   The Times had two black reporters on the story, Junius Griffin
and Ted Jones, who set up a temporary bureau in the Theresa Hotel
at 125th Street and 7th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin was a former Marine. He broke in as a journalist on
Stars and Stripes, the United States military newspaper. In Harlem,
he emerged a hero. He saw a group of blacks surround and threaten
three white reporters from the Journal-American, a Hearst
newspaper. He charged into the crowd, grabbed the reporters, and
walked them out unharmed. He knew that only a black reporter could
do that.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Jones made news too. He watched some cops chasing black
youths who had been throwing rocks and bottles. As the kids outran
the cops and got away, some in the crowd cheered derisively. In
frustration, the cops began to use their nightsticks at random.
Impulsively, Ted interceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people didn't do anything,'' he yelled.
</P>
<P>
   When the cops ignored him and continued swinging their batons
wildly, he pressed forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no right to beat these people,'' he insisted. ``You
cannot do that. You can't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' a cop barked, irritated.
</P>
<P>
   Ted grabbed his press card and held it out. ``The New York
Times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out of here,'' the cop ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and heavyset, Ted refused to budge. As the cops continued
their attack, he was knocked to the ground. He wasn't injured, only
shook up, but what happened to him became a part of the news story.
</P>
<P>
   The riots raged through three nights, and at the end of each
day, long after the crowds and the cops had drifted away, the
reporters would still be on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   We could sense that something enormous was happening and that it
was our destiny to be at the center of it. Hanging together, we
quickly discovered the many paths we'd taken to get where we were
at that moment and the circumstance of timing that had opened the
door for us.

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART THREE: Hours after the Harlem riot, thousands of
blacks streamed into the streets of Rochester, N.Y., in frenzied
mobs. They were followed by a horde of reporters. Still in his
hotel room in Harlem, Earl Caldwell received a frantic phone call
from Dick Dougherty, the city editor at the Democrat and Chronicle,
who ordered him to return to Rochester to cover the breaking
events. Here, Caldwell describes the social unrest that gripped
Rochester after the street rioting ended, his chance to meet and
talk with Malcolm X, and one of the most important lessons he
learned about being a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   A lot happened in Rochester before I was to say my last
good-bye. The riots had shifted the dynamic there. Blacks savored a
newfound power to force the white leadership to address
longstanding grievances. Whites were scared. Would future rioting
be confined to the ghetto, or would it spread downtown to white
areas of the city?
</P>
<P>
   Anxieties mounted when a coalition of religious groups brought
in Saul Alinsky, already a legend as a white organizer who taught
confrontational politics to ghetto activists. From this emerged
FIGHT, a militant direct-action group whose members were soon
marching into executive boardrooms demanding jobs and investments
in the black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester was getting a reputation. The ultimate confirmation of
that came when Malcolm X accepted an invitation to address a black
church there in February 1965.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Malcolm was involved in a dispute with Elijah
Muhammad's black Muslim organization. Four days before his
scheduled appearance in Rochester, his home in Queens, N.Y., was
firebombed.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' Alex Haley told of how
Malcolm, ``barking commands and snatching up screaming frightened
children, got the family safely out of the back door into the
yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm was sure that his enemies in Elijah Muhammad's group
were responsible for the attack. That feud seemed to be turning
lethal.
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester, there was speculation that the speech would be
canceled. But Malcolm arrived at Corn Hill Methodist Church on Feb.
16 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   I was stunned when my editors assigned another reporter to cover
Malcolm's speech. They pulled me aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be trouble,'' I was told. ``We need you to handle
the street action.'' Although devastated, I accepted the
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the speech, a huge crowd was at the church. A
source whispered to me that Malcolm X wanted to meet later with
some local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like you to be there,'' I was told.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm delivered a powerful speech, which I watched from the
back of the church.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he stood up, he was saying, ``My reason for being
here is to discuss the black revolution that is going on, that's
taking place on this earth. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone jammed into the church hung on his every word.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the problems of the black man here in this country today
have ceased to be a problem of just the American Negro or an
American problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a professor, he delivered his analysis in lecture style.
Then, about halfway through, he zeroed in on his target of the
night: the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're not against people because they're white. But we're
against those who practice racism. ... And because we're against
it, the press says we're violent. We're not for violence. We're for
peace. But the people that we're up against are for violence.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice, at first professorial, began to rise. ``This is what
the racists have always done ... And then they use the press to
make (it) look like the victim is the criminal, and the criminal is
the victim. ... They take the press, and through the press they
beat the system ... They use the press to get public opinion on
their side. ... They take statistics, and through the press they
feed them to the public. They make it appear that the role of crime
in the black community is higher than it is anywhere else. ... And
the whites go along with it. Because they think that everybody over
there's a criminal anyway. This is what the press does.''
</P>
<P>
   Through most of an hour, Malcolm X cited example after example
of how the press was used against black people. As he made his
case, many in the crowd stood and shouted their approval.
</P>
<P>
   I began to feel relieved that I was not covering his speech. I
also realized that I could not go to his hotel later with the
others. He was so damning in his indictment that I was convinced
that the meeting would be a ``get the press'' session. As a
representative of the local paper, I did not feel that I should be
there.
</P>
<P>
   As much as I wanted to meet Malcolm, I did not go.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, on Feb. 21, a cold and snowy Sunday, I was at
work at the Democrat and Chronicle. Sundays were always slow and I
was standing in the wire room, watching the various stories come in
over the teletype machines.
</P>
<P>
   I was there when the teletype bell began to ring, alerting
editors that a very important story was about to move. And that
day, when the bell began to ring, I hovered over the machine and
watched in horror as the bulletin came in that Malcolm X had been
shot and killed just as he was starting to deliver a speech at the
Audubon Ballroom in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the lesson driven home was that a reporter's job
required toughness and that journalism was not the place for one
easily embarrassed or intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   I had missed my chance to meet and talk with Malcolm X. I vowed
never to make a similar mistake.

</P>
<P>
   In Harlem on the Sunday that Malcolm X was killed, two
reporters, Stan Scott and Gene Simpson, were right up front in the
Audubon Ballroom, so close to the podium that when the shooting
started, they had to dive to the floor for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Being there changed a lot for Scott and Simpson. But how they
came to be in the ballroom that afternoon played a large part in
ushering in a whole new era for black reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In the epilogue to ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' the
writer Alex Haley explained that on the day he was killed, Malcolm
X had specifically ordered that no press be allowed inside the
Audubon Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   When Scott and Simpson arrived for Malcolm's meeting, their
press credentials were in clear view. At the door, the men were
greeted by one of Malcolm's lieutenants. ``No press allowed,'' he
told them.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, the two stood pondering the ``no press'' edict.
Malcolm's aide pointed to their credentials and offered a
suggestion. ``Put 'em in your pocket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They complied. ``As black citizens, you can go on in,'' the aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   And that afternoon Stan Scott and Gene Simpson got what
reporters dream of _ the experience of being there, of being
wherever it is at the precise moment that something truly important
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence in the Audobon Ballroom that day changed the two
reporters' professional lives, for the better. Scott, who was
working for United Press International, was lured away to join
WINS, New York City's leading all-news radio station. Simpson, a
reporter for WMCA radio, left to join CBS radio's all-news
operation.
</P>
<P>
   But more significant than what happened to those news reporters
was the action taken by Malcolm X's supporters in the wake of his
murder. What the supporters did brought a swift, definable change
to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm's aides had concluded that their leader's ``no press''
order was proof that the time had come in which the black community
and black meetings should be off limits to white reporters. And
they also believed that if Malcolm had made an exception for black
reporters, so should they.
</P>
<P>
   So, grieving and wanting to honor their slain leader, they made
it their cause to keep white reporters out of meetings among
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long after, as a reporter for the Herald Tribune, I
witnessed nothing more shocking than the tense confrontations that
ensued when white reporters showed up in Harlem and other black
communities to cover meetings and rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom did anybody ever bar them at the door. The reporters
would be allowed inside and even get seated. It was like baiting a
trap.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the meeting was about to begin, someone would shout,
``Wait, wait, wait,'' and, pointing toward the reporters who were
white, would ask: ``What are they doing in here?''
</P>
<P>
   And then the show was on. Voices got louder, people jumped to
their feet, and immediately they began shouting the demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``White reporters out! White reporters out!''
</P>
<P>
   When the white reporters did not leave fast enough or dared to
argue a right to stay, they would be grabbed and roughly ushered
out the door. Those of us who were reporters and black discreetly
put our notebooks and pencils away, but we did not budge from our
seats and nobody ever tried to force us out.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, already embarrassed at being scooped by
UPI on the assassination of Malcolm X, responded by opening a news
bureau in the heart of Harlem. Gil Scott and Hollie West, both
blacks, were the two reporters assigned to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Scott, born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y., began his career
in journalism in 1957 as a desk assistant at CBS. In 1959, he moved
to the Reporter-Dispatch in White Plains, N.Y., where he worked as
a sportswriter. His career was interrupted briefly when he was
recalled to active duty in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he joined the Newark News, where he and John Dotson
were the only black reporters on staff. Gil Scott stayed there
until he was hired by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma native, Hollie West, in 1963, became the first black
reporter on a daily newspaper in the San Francisco Bay area. That
paper was the Oakland Tribune. From Oakland, West went to New York
to work at the AP not long after Malcolm X was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the AP's Harlem bureau was up and running, the
summer of 1965 was fast approaching. Many news organizations
pondered the same question: ``What are blacks going to do?'' Little
did they know that black culture was about to take center stage.

</P>
<P>
   Mylus Martin hastened the call that brought me to New York City
and the Herald Tribune newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   It was the winter of 1966 and editors at the paper were in a
quandary. Claude Lewis, who had been recruited from Newsweek, had
left the paper for a job at the Philadelphia Bulletin. Lewis had
been the reporter the Trib counted on to cover the exploding story
of race. Now, the editors wanted a reporter to literally camp out
in Harlem and other ``Negro'' areas of New York to report and write
about what was taking place. A white reporter could not do that.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was the only reporter on the Trib, and he flat out
refused to cover the race story.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what I do,'' he argued. He said that he was trained
in music and that his skill was covering the arts. That was the
coverage he had come to the Trib to write, Martin said. ``Send
somebody else up to Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's steadfastness brought the call that I had been waiting
for in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a problem covering that story?'' asked David
Laventhol, city editor of the Herald Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' I told him.
</P>
<P>
   And that was it. The story that Mylus Martin did not want became
the one that I could not get enough of. It was more than just a big
story. A massive redefinition of self was taking place in the
ghettos. Very little went unchallenged, and at the core was an
unprecedented embracing of blackness.
</P>
<P>
   The phrases ``Black is beautiful'' and ``I'm black and I'm
proud'' were said again and again on the streets. It was black
Africa, black America, black studies, black teachers, black
lawyers, black cops and black children. A whole world was exploding
around blackness.
</P>
<P>
   It was a revolution. As reporters, we were on the inside,
watching it all and telling of it as it happened.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just about skin color. This fact hit me with a bang
when, while covering my Harlem beat, I met two brothers, Elombe and
Kwame Brath.
</P>
<P>
   The Braths had been putting on the ``Naturally'' shows for years
_ shows that focused on black hair styles and fashions _ without
many people noticing. Still they kept going.
</P>
<P>
   But this was 1966 and times were changing. ``Naturally 1966''
caused a sensation. The shows featured women who were called ``the
Grandassa models'' (named after ``Grassaland,'' the name African
nationalist leader Carlos Cooks applied to Africa).
</P>
<P>
   The models had very dark complexions. And instead of
straightening their hair with hot combs, they wore ``naturals,''
later called ``Afros,'' which meant groomed and worn naturally.
</P>
<P>
   The Grandassa models were stunning. They were so dark that their
faces had a bluish shimmer. People described them as
``blue-black.'' You saw them and your mouth just fell open.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were ready,'' Elombe Brath recalled. ``The time was
right.'' And it was. A lot of women took to the ``natural'' look.
And nobody was neutral: You either liked it or you didn't.
</P>
<P>
   For us reporters, the ``race story'' was not simply about
covering riots. It was far more compelling than that, far more
socially significant. We realized we were at the eye of a profound
social shift.
</P>
<P>
   Our growing colony in New York City changed too, and in a
significant way. We were not all male anymore. Ruth Ross broke
through at Newsweek magazine. She started as a researcher in 1964.
In 1966, with the race story as important as any other, she became
the first woman to join our contingent as a reporter on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   And there was something else: A lot of black reporters also put
away the hot combs, the Dixie Peach, the Murray's hair dressings
and the stocking caps and showed up for work sporting ``Afro'' hair
styles.
</P>
<P>
   In more than a few newsrooms, all hell broke loose. At a TV
station where she was a reporter, Melba Tolliver was told that she
could not go on the air unless she first put on a scarf or
something to cover her Afro. She refused, but the station did not
back down until a black protest was mounted.
</P>
<P>
   At some other news outlets, editors ordered black reporters to
get hair cuts.
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible for me to separate myself entirely from the
movement that I had been thrust into. The ``roots'' that were being
examined were my roots too. And the activists pushing for this
change were young, many of them about my age. I gravitated to their
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   It rang true for me when they derisively attacked the word
``Negro'' (``knee-grow'') as something from cotton patches and
plantations. I was ready to shake ``Negro'' off too. The word
``black'' made sense. It linked black America to black Africa. I
wanted to be called black.
</P>
<P>
   I got rid of my hair grease and stocking caps. I let my hair
grow natural. The Afro I cultivated was modest, but that was the
way I wanted it. I could connect with the movement on the streets
and as a reporter, and still be considered promising by my white
editors at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they understood.

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART ONE: In August 1963, tensions between blacks and
whites in many cities across the United States were on the rise.
Crowds converged on the nation's capital for the historic March on
Washington. Earl Caldwell, then a reporter for the Lancaster
Intelligencer-Journal, joined his parents in the living room of
their home in central Pennsylvania to watch Martin Luther King Jr.
deliver what many call his finest speech. Ten days later, a bomb
exploded during Sunday services at a black church in Birmingham,
Ala., killing four girls. Across urban America, black populations
became restless, and newspaper editors began searching for
reporters who could get inside the ``ghettos'' to gather stories
from those black communities. The Democrat and Chronicle in
Rochester, N.Y., began to recruit Caldwell aggressively. In the
fall of 1963, he accepted the job. Here, Caldwell recounts his
first assignment for the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The story was boxed across the top of the front page of the
Sunday edition. It was even above the masthead. Of all the stories
I had ever written, nothing came close to this, my first story as a
reporter at the Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the story herald my arrival, but there was also a
photograph of me, which was a way of letting readers know that for
the first time the newspaper had a reporter who was black.
</P>
<P>
   I'd arrived in town expecting the newspaper to make good on a
promise. Back when they were wooing me, I was told that if I
accepted the job, they would have an apartment waiting in a luxury
building not far from the newspaper. When I got to town and
mentioned all of this, I got a blank stare. Nobody knew what I was
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Dick Dougherty came up with his idea. He was the city
editor, and on my first day at the D&AMP;C, he told me that of all the
complaints that he was getting from blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the housing here is really segregated,'' he said. ``I
don't know if that's true or not. You have to find an apartment. We
don't need to phony up anything. We can use your experience to tell
a true story of what the situation really is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you do it?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty was a tall, thin guy whose hair was white even though
he didn't look to be a day past 35. His style was low key but very
persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   I had never reported and written a story about race, and what
Dougherty was suggesting caught me off-guard. But I was just
starting out on a new job; there was no way I was going to say no
to my city editor.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty wanted two reporters on the story _ one white and one
black. The plan was for each of us to try separately to rent the
same apartment. The white reporter was Bill Vogler. He was a
veteran on the staff at the D&AMP;C and he liked the idea. The two of
us got newspapers and circled apartments in my price range. Then we
got started.
</P>
<P>
   After we had visited about five or six apartments, Vogler asked
me, ``Are you sure you're actually going into these places?''
</P>
<P>
   He did not understand. I would just reach the door and promptly
be told, ``The apartment has already been rented.'' Right after I
was told that no apartment was available, Vogler would visit the
same place and be invited inside. He'd get a whole spiel on how
great the apartment was, why he'd like it and what the neighborhood
had to offer.
</P>
<P>
   My experience was so different that at times it would be
downright embarrassing. One building had a big sign on the lawn,
Apartment for Rent. I was heading up the sidewalk when a window on
the second floor opened. A woman leaned out and hollered: ``If
you're coming for the apartment, forget it. It's already rented.''
</P>
<P>
   Once I explained all this to Vogler, we kept going. We visited
apartment after apartment. It was always the same: no to me, yes to
him. I just kept making notes of everything that happened. At the
typewriter, I got my chance to tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the story was published, blacks began showing up
in the newsroom ``to meet Earl Caldwell.'' Some would barge right
past the receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   These were not ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Some people called these visitors troublemakers. They called
themselves activists, which meant they were in the forefront of
stoking, shaping and channeling the anger they said was growing in
Rochester's two black communities, the Third and Seventh wards.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper itself was a target of their anger. They said they
never saw reporters in their neighborhoods ``except when there's
trouble'' and accused the newspaper of not covering the important
issues in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   They looked to me to change that. They said that they expected
to see me in their communities, to tell the stories that were not
being told. The irony was that in a sense, my editor and the
activists were saying the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find out what the facts are,'' Dougherty had
challenged me. ``We expect you to tell the story,'' the activists
said, inviting me to the ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   I was being handed what every reporter wants: a big and
important story.
</P>
<P>
   The front-page story of my experience in hunting an apartment
had given me the kind of notoriety that a reporter new in town
could only dream of. The reaction was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Once the story was published, so many whites called to offer an
apartment that I had to write another piece just to tell that
story. One very nice woman, also white, did rent me a place not far
from the office.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I had settled in, black folks still hung a nickname
on me. They called me boll weevil. The name came from the title of
a popular song, and when they'd see me, they'd say, with a lot of
laughter, ``Here comes boll weevil. He's still looking for a
home.'''

<P>
   PRELUDE TO PART TWO: On a hot night in Harlem in July 1964, the
explosion came. After a white police officer had shot and killed a
black youth, riots erupted in the black neighborhoods in the
northeast _ a portent of what was to come. At the Democrat and
Chronicle, the city editor called Earl Caldwell to his desk. ``We
want you to go down to Harlem,'' he said. Although Caldwell had
visited New York, he had never been to Harlem. He grabbed a
notebook and a few clothes and headed for the airport, hoping that
his experience in Rochester had prepared him for the challenge in
New York City. Here, Caldwell describes what it was like for him
and other black reporters in Harlem during the riots, which raged
around them for three nights.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The rioting in Harlem came in furious bursts. Rocks and bottles
sailed from tenement roofs. Molotov cocktails exploded on streets
littered with broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   Cops fired salvo after salvo into smoky, pitch-black skies.
Police cruisers, sirens wailing, roared in pursuit of hit-and-run
looters.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds lined the streets, sometimes as many as a thousand
people, all of them black. They screamed, jeered, ducked, dodged
and _ when turned on by riot-weary cops _ scrambled and ran.
</P>
<P>
   And there we were, smack in the middle of it, with notebooks in
hand, dashing at the heels of the crowds, observing the battles and
trying as best we could to record it all.
</P>
<P>
   Frenzied as it was in those moments of battle, that's all they
were, moments. They would rise like a storm and then, just as
suddenly, dissipate. And with every inevitable lull in the action,
attention turned to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' people demanded. Some would reach for the press
credentials that dangled from our necks.
</P>
<P>
   We tried to explain ourselves. ``We're press,'' we said. But
that was not nearly explanation enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``What press?'' our inquisitors fired back.
</P>
<P>
   In that back-and-forth, something that even we had not realized
came into focus. Harlem cops and black residents had seen black
reporters before. But almost without exception those reporters
worked for black newspapers, mainly weeklies. This time we
represented mainstream white-owned daily newspapers and radio
stations, a major first.
</P>
<P>
   A small colony of reporters who were black had arrived in the
big leagues of New York City journalism. And this took everyone by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Having come from Rochester, I was as astonished as the police
and the blacks on the streets to see at least a dozen or so
reporters, all black like me, representing large and powerful
organizations such as The New York Times, the Associated Press, the
New York Post, the Daily News, United Press International, Newsday,
and Newsweek and Time magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In that week, I came to know reporters such as Gerald Fraser,
Austin Scott, Ted Poston, Tom Johnson, Les Carson, Claude Lewis,
Ted Jones, Junius Griffin, Wally Terry, Paul Hathaway, Gene Simpson
and Stan Scott.
</P>
<P>
   And on the streets of Harlem, between bursts of rioting, we
acknowledged with one another that we were a part of a bit of
history.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just that we were there. What was developing into one
of the biggest stories in America was largely in our hands. The
events unfolding on the streets of Harlem would make news all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been little more than a mere footnote but it was
still a piece of history in the making. Never had the major media
put so much of an important story in the hands of reporters who
were not white.
</P>
<P>
   Every chance they got, the cops would stare us down. It was as
though they could not accept that we were qualified and that our
reporting would be central to what people everywhere would read of
the Harlem riots.
</P>
<P>
   Some white reporters sought us out. They would shake our hands
and stay as close to us as possible. That put them closer to the
story. It also made them feel safer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a white New York Times photographer was jumped by a mob
and beaten so badly that the bones around his eyes were broken.
</P>
<P>
   The Times had two black reporters on the story, Junius Griffin
and Ted Jones, who set up a temporary bureau in the Theresa Hotel
at 125th Street and 7th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin was a former Marine. He broke in as a journalist on
Stars and Stripes, the United States military newspaper. In Harlem,
he emerged a hero. He saw a group of blacks surround and threaten
three white reporters from the Journal-American, a Hearst
newspaper. He charged into the crowd, grabbed the reporters, and
walked them out unharmed. He knew that only a black reporter could
do that.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Jones made news too. He watched some cops chasing black
youths who had been throwing rocks and bottles. As the kids outran
the cops and got away, some in the crowd cheered derisively. In
frustration, the cops began to use their nightsticks at random.
Impulsively, Ted interceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people didn't do anything,'' he yelled.
</P>
<P>
   When the cops ignored him and continued swinging their batons
wildly, he pressed forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no right to beat these people,'' he insisted. ``You
cannot do that. You can't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' a cop barked, irritated.
</P>
<P>
   Ted grabbed his press card and held it out. ``The New York
Times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out of here,'' the cop ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and heavyset, Ted refused to budge. As the cops continued
their attack, he was knocked to the ground. He wasn't injured, only
shook up, but what happened to him became a part of the news story.
</P>
<P>
   The riots raged through three nights, and at the end of each
day, long after the crowds and the cops had drifted away, the
reporters would still be on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   We could sense that something enormous was happening and that it
was our destiny to be at the center of it. Hanging together, we
quickly discovered the many paths we'd taken to get where we were
at that moment and the circumstance of timing that had opened the
door for us.

   PRELUDE TO PART THREE: Hours after the Harlem riot, thousands of
blacks streamed into the streets of Rochester, N.Y., in frenzied
mobs. They were followed by a horde of reporters. Still in his
hotel room in Harlem, Earl Caldwell received a frantic phone call
from Dick Dougherty, the city editor at the Democrat and Chronicle,
who ordered him to return to Rochester to cover the breaking
events. Here, Caldwell describes the social unrest that gripped
Rochester after the street rioting ended, his chance to meet and
talk with Malcolm X, and one of the most important lessons he
learned about being a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   A lot happened in Rochester before I was to say my last
good-bye. The riots had shifted the dynamic there. Blacks savored a
newfound power to force the white leadership to address
longstanding grievances. Whites were scared. Would future rioting
be confined to the ghetto, or would it spread downtown to white
areas of the city?
</P>
<P>
   Anxieties mounted when a coalition of religious groups brought
in Saul Alinsky, already a legend as a white organizer who taught
confrontational politics to ghetto activists. From this emerged
FIGHT, a militant direct-action group whose members were soon
marching into executive boardrooms demanding jobs and investments
in the black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester was getting a reputation. The ultimate confirmation of
that came when Malcolm X accepted an invitation to address a black
church there in February 1965.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Malcolm was involved in a dispute with Elijah
Muhammad's black Muslim organization. Four days before his
scheduled appearance in Rochester, his home in Queens, N.Y., was
firebombed.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' Alex Haley told of how
Malcolm, ``barking commands and snatching up screaming frightened
children, got the family safely out of the back door into the
yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm was sure that his enemies in Elijah Muhammad's group
were responsible for the attack. That feud seemed to be turning
lethal.
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester, there was speculation that the speech would be
canceled. But Malcolm arrived at Corn Hill Methodist Church on Feb.
16 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   I was stunned when my editors assigned another reporter to cover
Malcolm's speech. They pulled me aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be trouble,'' I was told. ``We need you to handle
the street action.'' Although devastated, I accepted the
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the speech, a huge crowd was at the church. A
source whispered to me that Malcolm X wanted to meet later with
some local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like you to be there,'' I was told.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm delivered a powerful speech, which I watched from the
back of the church.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he stood up, he was saying, ``My reason for being
here is to discuss the black revolution that is going on, that's
taking place on this earth. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone jammed into the church hung on his every word.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the problems of the black man here in this country today
have ceased to be a problem of just the American Negro or an
American problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a professor, he delivered his analysis in lecture style.
Then, about halfway through, he zeroed in on his target of the
night: the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're not against people because they're white. But we're
against those who practice racism. ... And because we're against
it, the press says we're violent. We're not for violence. We're for
peace. But the people that we're up against are for violence.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice, at first professorial, began to rise. ``This is what
the racists have always done ... And then they use the press to
make (it) look like the victim is the criminal, and the criminal is
the victim. ... They take the press, and through the press they
beat the system ... They use the press to get public opinion on
their side. ... They take statistics, and through the press they
feed them to the public. They make it appear that the role of crime
in the black community is higher than it is anywhere else. ... And
the whites go along with it. Because they think that everybody over
there's a criminal anyway. This is what the press does.''
</P>
<P>
   Through most of an hour, Malcolm X cited example after example
of how the press was used against black people. As he made his
case, many in the crowd stood and shouted their approval.
</P>
<P>
   I began to feel relieved that I was not covering his speech. I
also realized that I could not go to his hotel later with the
others. He was so damning in his indictment that I was convinced
that the meeting would be a ``get the press'' session. As a
representative of the local paper, I did not feel that I should be
there.
</P>
<P>
   As much as I wanted to meet Malcolm, I did not go.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, on Feb. 21, a cold and snowy Sunday, I was at
work at the Democrat and Chronicle. Sundays were always slow and I
was standing in the wire room, watching the various stories come in
over the teletype machines.
</P>
<P>
   I was there when the teletype bell began to ring, alerting
editors that a very important story was about to move. And that
day, when the bell began to ring, I hovered over the machine and
watched in horror as the bulletin came in that Malcolm X had been
shot and killed just as he was starting to deliver a speech at the
Audubon Ballroom in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the lesson driven home was that a reporter's job
required toughness and that journalism was not the place for one
easily embarrassed or intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   I had missed my chance to meet and talk with Malcolm X. I vowed
never to make a similar mistake.

   (ATTENTION EDITORS: For Black History month, which begins on
Monday, Feb. 1, The New York times Syndicate is offering a
five-part feature, ``The Caldwell Journals,'' an account of major
moments in the civil-rights movement of the 1960s by Earl Caldwell,
the nationally acclaimed black journalist whose early career was
shaped by that dynamic era. Caldwell, a former New York Times
reporter, was witness to some of the most important events of the
last 40 years. He covered the riots that swept many American cities
during the summer of 1967. In 1995, the National Association of
Black Journalists presented Caldwell with its President's Award,
saying his record of professional achievement made him ``one of the
most important journalists in the last 50 years.'' Caldwell is
currently a writer-in-residence at the Robert C. Maynard Institute
for Journalism Education in Oakland, Calif., and is writing ``The
Caldwell Journals'' for the institute's Web site. For purchase

<P>
   In Harlem on the Sunday that Malcolm X was killed, two
reporters, Stan Scott and Gene Simpson, were right up front in the
Audubon Ballroom, so close to the podium that when the shooting
started, they had to dive to the floor for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Being there changed a lot for Scott and Simpson. But how they
came to be in the ballroom that afternoon played a large part in
ushering in a whole new era for black reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In the epilogue to ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' the
writer Alex Haley explained that on the day he was killed, Malcolm
X had specifically ordered that no press be allowed inside the
Audubon Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   When Scott and Simpson arrived for Malcolm's meeting, their
press credentials were in clear view. At the door, the men were
greeted by one of Malcolm's lieutenants. ``No press allowed,'' he
told them.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, the two stood pondering the ``no press'' edict.
Malcolm's aide pointed to their credentials and offered a
suggestion. ``Put 'em in your pocket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They complied. ``As black citizens, you can go on in,'' the aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   And that afternoon Stan Scott and Gene Simpson got what
reporters dream of _ the experience of being there, of being
wherever it is at the precise moment that something truly important
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence in the Audobon Ballroom that day changed the two
reporters' professional lives, for the better. Scott, who was
working for United Press International, was lured away to join
WINS, New York City's leading all-news radio station. Simpson, a
reporter for WMCA radio, left to join CBS radio's all-news
operation.
</P>
<P>
   But more significant than what happened to those news reporters
was the action taken by Malcolm X's supporters in the wake of his
murder. What the supporters did brought a swift, definable change
to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm's aides had concluded that their leader's ``no press''
order was proof that the time had come in which the black community
and black meetings should be off limits to white reporters. And
they also believed that if Malcolm had made an exception for black
reporters, so should they.
</P>
<P>
   So, grieving and wanting to honor their slain leader, they made
it their cause to keep white reporters out of meetings among
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long after, as a reporter for the Herald Tribune, I
witnessed nothing more shocking than the tense confrontations that
ensued when white reporters showed up in Harlem and other black
communities to cover meetings and rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom did anybody ever bar them at the door. The reporters
would be allowed inside and even get seated. It was like baiting a
trap.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the meeting was about to begin, someone would shout,
``Wait, wait, wait,'' and, pointing toward the reporters who were
white, would ask: ``What are they doing in here?''
</P>
<P>
   And then the show was on. Voices got louder, people jumped to
their feet, and immediately they began shouting the demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``White reporters out! White reporters out!''
</P>
<P>
   When the white reporters did not leave fast enough or dared to
argue a right to stay, they would be grabbed and roughly ushered
out the door. Those of us who were reporters and black discreetly
put our notebooks and pencils away, but we did not budge from our
seats and nobody ever tried to force us out.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, already embarrassed at being scooped by
UPI on the assassination of Malcolm X, responded by opening a news
bureau in the heart of Harlem. Gil Scott and Hollie West, both
blacks, were the two reporters assigned to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Scott, born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y., began his career
in journalism in 1957 as a desk assistant at CBS. In 1959, he moved
to the Reporter-Dispatch in White Plains, N.Y., where he worked as
a sportswriter. His career was interrupted briefly when he was
recalled to active duty in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he joined the Newark News, where he and John Dotson
were the only black reporters on staff. Gil Scott stayed there
until he was hired by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma native, Hollie West, in 1963, became the first black
reporter on a daily newspaper in the San Francisco Bay area. That
paper was the Oakland Tribune. From Oakland, West went to New York
to work at the AP not long after Malcolm X was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the AP's Harlem bureau was up and running, the
summer of 1965 was fast approaching. Many news organizations
pondered the same question: ``What are blacks going to do?'' Little
did they know that black culture was about to take center stage.

</P>
<P>
   Mylus Martin hastened the call that brought me to New York City
and the Herald Tribune newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   It was the winter of 1966 and editors at the paper were in a
quandary. Claude Lewis, who had been recruited from Newsweek, had
left the paper for a job at the Philadelphia Bulletin. Lewis had
been the reporter the Trib counted on to cover the exploding story
of race. Now, the editors wanted a reporter to literally camp out
in Harlem and other ``Negro'' areas of New York to report and write
about what was taking place. A white reporter could not do that.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was the only reporter on the Trib, and he flat out
refused to cover the race story.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what I do,'' he argued. He said that he was trained
in music and that his skill was covering the arts. That was the
coverage he had come to the Trib to write, Martin said. ``Send
somebody else up to Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's steadfastness brought the call that I had been waiting
for in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a problem covering that story?'' asked David
Laventhol, city editor of the Herald Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' I told him.
</P>
<P>
   And that was it. The story that Mylus Martin did not want became
the one that I could not get enough of. It was more than just a big
story. A massive redefinition of self was taking place in the
ghettos. Very little went unchallenged, and at the core was an
unprecedented embracing of blackness.
</P>
<P>
   The phrases ``Black is beautiful'' and ``I'm black and I'm
proud'' were said again and again on the streets. It was black
Africa, black America, black studies, black teachers, black
lawyers, black cops and black children. A whole world was exploding
around blackness.
</P>
<P>
   It was a revolution. As reporters, we were on the inside,
watching it all and telling of it as it happened.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just about skin color. This fact hit me with a bang
when, while covering my Harlem beat, I met two brothers, Elombe and
Kwame Brath.
</P>
<P>
   The Braths had been putting on the ``Naturally'' shows for years
_ shows that focused on black hair styles and fashions _ without
many people noticing. Still they kept going.
</P>
<P>
   But this was 1966 and times were changing. ``Naturally 1966''
caused a sensation. The shows featured women who were called ``the
Grandassa models'' (named after ``Grassaland,'' the name African
nationalist leader Carlos Cooks applied to Africa).
</P>
<P>
   The models had very dark complexions. And instead of
straightening their hair with hot combs, they wore ``naturals,''
later called ``Afros,'' which meant groomed and worn naturally.
</P>
<P>
   The Grandassa models were stunning. They were so dark that their
faces had a bluish shimmer. People described them as
``blue-black.'' You saw them and your mouth just fell open.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were ready,'' Elombe Brath recalled. ``The time was
right.'' And it was. A lot of women took to the ``natural'' look.
And nobody was neutral: You either liked it or you didn't.
</P>
<P>
   For us reporters, the ``race story'' was not simply about
covering riots. It was far more compelling than that, far more
socially significant. We realized we were at the eye of a profound
social shift.
</P>
<P>
   Our growing colony in New York City changed too, and in a
significant way. We were not all male anymore. Ruth Ross broke
through at Newsweek magazine. She started as a researcher in 1964.
In 1966, with the race story as important as any other, she became
the first woman to join our contingent as a reporter on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   And there was something else: A lot of black reporters also put
away the hot combs, the Dixie Peach, the Murray's hair dressings
and the stocking caps and showed up for work sporting ``Afro'' hair
styles.
</P>
<P>
   In more than a few newsrooms, all hell broke loose. At a TV
station where she was a reporter, Melba Tolliver was told that she
could not go on the air unless she first put on a scarf or
something to cover her Afro. She refused, but the station did not
back down until a black protest was mounted.
</P>
<P>
   At some other news outlets, editors ordered black reporters to
get hair cuts.
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible for me to separate myself entirely from the
movement that I had been thrust into. The ``roots'' that were being
examined were my roots too. And the activists pushing for this
change were young, many of them about my age. I gravitated to their
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   It rang true for me when they derisively attacked the word
``Negro'' (``knee-grow'') as something from cotton patches and
plantations. I was ready to shake ``Negro'' off too. The word
``black'' made sense. It linked black America to black Africa. I
wanted to be called black.
</P>
<P>
   I got rid of my hair grease and stocking caps. I let my hair
grow natural. The Afro I cultivated was modest, but that was the
way I wanted it. I could connect with the movement on the streets
and as a reporter, and still be considered promising by my white
editors at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they understood.

GORE AND MCCAIN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Hampshire voters today decide one of the most hotly
contested and perhaps pivotal presidential primaries on record. The
Globe reaffirms its endorsement of Vice President Al Gore in the
Democratic primary and Senator John McCain for the Republican
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 days of heavy campaigning since we first made these
endorsements have only strengthened the case for them.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has shown a steadiness of purpose, a command of the issues,
and a determination that have become the hallmarks of his campaign.
To this he has managed to add new foresight _ on such issues as
globalization and technology _ and a degree of idealism on such
issues as gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, meanwhile, has continued to emphasize a promise of bold
reforms highlighted by his insistence on campaign finance reform.
In McCain's presentation, these initiatives are not airy do-good
theories, but grow out of a thorough understanding of the way
Washington operates, and how it could do better.
</P>
<P>
   In competitive races in both parties, Gore and McCain are the
clear choices.

 &HT;    Elian's case has devolved into a (sur)real mess
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ You hear it everywhere you go. The
coffee pot at the quick-change oil place. The teachers' lounge. The
mall. The dentist's office and the grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   That poor kid, people say. And you know right off who they're
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many ridiculous, idiotic, revolting, disgusting,
despicable aspects of the Elian Gonzalez case. Crazy things happen
when people don't understand one another. It's easy for me to say,
Send him home.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that's what I've been saying all along.
</P>
<P>
   But what do I know, really know, of Cuba, a country where the
government can control your job, your friends, your words. I
suppose living under that kind of control can turn a person inside
out. Make 'em do crazy things.
</P>
<P>
   Look at what it did to Elisabeth Brotons, Elian's mother. She
died trying to bring her 5-year-old son to this country.
</P>
<P>
   The thing about Elian, now 6, is that there's so much at stake _
mainly him _ that people are having to overlook him. They're having
to lobby and mug and pander to get themselves heard. If that sounds
crazy, it's because it is.
</P>
<P>
   For me, for a lot of us, the drama went from real to surreal
when Elian's ``Miami family'' allowed him to be photographed with
the congressional subpoena. Remember that? That was very hard to
stomach. The boy held it out in front of him like he understood
what it was. I knew right then that the stakes were so high that
good-minded people had been cornered into making a child do things
that sickened even them.
</P>
<P>
   The whole mess is so bizarre it's hard to imagine what they'll
cut out for the TV movie. But they'll have to. All the weird truth
won't fit.
</P>
<P>
   The messiah angle. The angels who hovered over the child at sea.
The plain-Jane grandmas wearing winter coats for the first time.
The cousin smiling and saying she is sure the boy wants to stay.
What is she again? A cousin 45 times removed? The father who
supposedly called from Cuba during the meeting at the politically
connected nun's Miami Beach house.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, what a horrid public mess all the grown-ups have made of
things. Even if Attorney General Janet Reno, who is from Miami and
knows the Cuban community, says the boy should go back, how will
they get him out of that house? Somehow, the image of Bruce Willis
dressed in black, running toward the helicopter with Elian tucked
under his arm, doesn't seem strange at all.
</P>
<P>
   These days, I'm not even sure the child should go.
</P>
<P>
   I wish the whole heartbreaking mess would go away. I wish the
cousins would quit parading him around. I wish they'd fire their PR
man with the fancy cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   I wish the grandmas seemed more loving and less programmed. I
wish the dad would come here. I wish Cuba was a different place. I
wish I better understood why it's not. But most of all, I just wish
that boy's mother were still alive.

 &HT;    Sometimes, 'oops' not sufficient government explanation
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ These days you can get an anti-government mob
going with a point and a click. So it's good to see news stories on
apparent government flub-ups that reserve judgment.
</P>
<P>
   A Coryell County, Texas, ranch had several 155 mm howitzer
shells rain on it. The shells, The Waco Tribune-Herald reported,
appropriately so, were ``believed to be fired from Fort Hood.''
</P>
<P>
   A reporter's job is not to make spot indictments. But someone
otherwise inclined might blurt: Where else do you get 155 mm
shells? The Quik-Pak?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there was a time when we could have tried to blame
something like this on Russians, or Cuban nationalists, or
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Doing forensics tests of these shells would be like autopsying
the guy who catches a falling baby-grand piano on his head. We know
what happened. The real question is: why?
</P>
<P>
   A few miles north and east, a judge, many attorneys and lots of
federal officials are still trying to come up with a cogent
explanation for what people around the world saw with their own
eyes: the horrible deaths of 76 people at the Branch Davidian
compound, 57 days after a shootout in which 10 people died.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who are not prone to spot indictments feel a little
like we're driving a motorized shopping cart at the Indy 500. By
now we've been lapped about 480 times by the racers who say they
know exactly what happened.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost seven years now and we still don't know who started
the Feb. 28 shootout, or whether any forensics evidence can back up
claims that federal agents fired into the compound the day of the
April 19 fire.
</P>
<P>
   We shouldn't need infrared film to tell us if FBI agents fired
at the Davidians during the siege. We should know from what bullets
were found in the Davidians who didn't die by fire. The medical
examiner who first got to look at the bodies said recently he'd
like a chance to examine the forensics evidence to address those
very questions.
</P>
<P>
   This is unnerving, because by satellite relay we all considered
ourselves eyewitnesses. Yes, we have a whole nation of experts
about the Branch Davidian tragedy, and over the last seven years
we've demonstrated the line between expertise and ignorance can be
fine.
</P>
<P>
   This playing field has given conspiracists much room to roam,
has given sickos like Timothy McVeigh reasons to keep their camo
pressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revelations'' seem to come frequently, but they don't tell us
much. The revelation that incendiary tear-gas shells, ``grenades''
in some people's phrasing, had been used in the siege sounded
explosive, except that nothing revealed thus far would indicate
that the grenades in question had anything to do with the fire.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the most compelling report about grenades had nothing
to do with the fire but had to do with the question, ``Who fired
first Feb. 28?''
</P>
<P>
   Treasury agents' diversionary use of a so-called flash-bang
grenade easily could have been perceived by hair-trigger gunmen
inside as the first ``shot'' of the opening shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the raid had been catastrophically compromised.
Cover blown, the ATF exposed a lot of people, including its own, to
lethal force.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting standoff had every criterion of a hostage
situation. A country that could wait a year or more to get hostages
out alive from foreign lands in this case couldn't wait to free
hostages in its back yard. After 51 days it forced the issue, and
fire settled it.
</P>
<P>
   We saw that happen, just like you can see the shells that hit
the ranch in Coryell County. We know what happened, at least that
which we saw. We still don't know why.

   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ We're still talking today about why a friend
named Gail _ 53, experienced, stable, a good citizen and a recent
honors graduate _ can't find a job teaching high-school history.
Readers from around the country responded to an earlier report with
understanding, frustration and occasional clenched teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Out in Arizona, a teacher writes, ``Hi, from the Navajo
country,'' and says they need Gail out there in the Dinetah. ``It
would probably involve poor pay, very modest living conditions, and
constituents whose first priority is not education,'' he admits,
but insists the job has its rewards. He is in his 13th year there.
</P>
<P>
   A retired teacher, (31.6 years in the classroom), attacks the
situation at what she believes to be its roots. Her suggestions
make a lot of sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put some of the blame for your friend Gail's woes,'' she
writes, ``on the colleges and universities. I honestly believe they
have no idea of the real world of education. They let Gail go all
that time, taking her money, convincing her she needed a master's
degree, when those of us already teaching knew that you weren't
going to get hired unless you had just graduated, and the ink was
still wet on your bachelor's degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the colleges and universities were doing their job, the
young ones (teachers) wouldn't be leaving after a few years once
they really found out what teaching was like. Dayton (Ohio) is
surrounded by universities, and I have wondered why they can't
solve the substitute problem. Why can't education students co-op by
becoming paid substitutes? They might even accept pay that a
certified teacher wouldn't, thus saving districts some money. What
a way to save money. What a way to get experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am still amazed at the number of unprepared young teachers
coming out of college today. A couple of years ago a brand new
teacher came to me and asked me about something she had just
received that she had to do with the students. It was the State 6th
Grade Proficiency Test. She said this was never really discussed in
any of her undergraduate education classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's economy, money is the number one attraction.
Education offers few incentives. You can expect to make money as a
lawyer, engineer, doctor, physical therapist, etc. In education
they keep piling on more and more requirements with no hope of
making anything close to what some of these other professionals
make. Why do that when you can make all kinds of money operating a
computer?
</P>
<P>
   ``The scary thing is that the solution seems simple to me. You
attract qualified people by paying them a competitive salary. What
bright young person will stay in education for long when he or she
could make double the money in many other fields?
</P>
<P>
   ``When districts try to pass levies by saying that none of the
money will be going to teachers' salaries, it really makes you glad
you are a professional. Let's attract the best, but we resent
paying them anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer hopes Gail will ``hang in there'' and keep trying to
find a teaching position, but the problem is that schools just
don't seem to be in the market for what she has to offer _
knowledge, wisdom, 19 years of schooling, and a passion to teach.
</P>
<P>
   It makes you wonder why anyone would be willing to exchange all
of that for a paycheck pretty much guaranteed to qualify a family
of four for food stamps.

 &HT;    Unmarried couples must plan carefully
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rex Burruss, a 36-year-old in a 15-year-old relationship, long
ago spotted the financial problems that can devastate unmarried
couples who don't plan ahead.
</P>
<P>
   There was the man who buried his partner, then found their home
confiscated by the dead man's family. There were friends who found
they couldn't make medical decisions when their partners were
incapacitated.
</P>
<P>
   He learned, ``You have to take care of yourself and your partner
and make sure your wishes are known,'' Burruss said. It's a mistake
to assume that the law will do it for you.
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone in facing such problems. At last count, unmarried
couples accounted for 5.9 million American households. That's about
one of every 17 households.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just a gay issue, either. Three out of four of those
5.9 million are opposite-sex couples, according to Census Bureau
data. A small fraction are retirees who are more than roommates but
less than bride and groom.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, the law often favors blood kin over an unmarried
partner, no matter how intimate, stable or long-lasting the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   But there are steps that couples can take.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is that an unmarried couple doesn't have
anything like the same legal rights that a married couple does,''
said Mark DiGiovanni, a certified financial planner in Snellville.
``The state doesn't put any value on an emotional commitment. You
have to follow up your emotional commitment with a legal one.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the important tasks are these:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Write your own contract. This means a binding, legal contract
that sets out the interests of each partner in the couple's
property and financial affairs. ``Unless people deal with property
issues in the beginning, you end up with disarray at the end,''
said D. Lynn Russell, a family law attorney with Russell &AMP; Herrera
in Decatur.
</P>
<P>
   A partnership agreement, sometimes called a ``living together
contract,'' is similar to prenuptial agreements sometimes signed by
married couples. Such contracts are even more important to
unmarried couples, no matter how cold they sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way to look at it is that we're not casting doom; we're
protecting each other,'' said Bob Bordett, a certified financial
planner in Atlanta. ``We're protecting each other's assets. Not
only am I protecting myself, I'm protecting you.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Get powers of attorney and living wills. ``If someone becomes
incapacitated and hasn't provided these legal documents, it's going
to fall to a relative,'' noted DiGiovanni. ``It may end up being a
disinterested sister making decisions, instead of the partner who
the party has been living with for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Powers of attorney can be used to authorize someone to direct
medical care and financial affairs if the signer is incapacitated.
A living will deals with the termination of life support.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Write your wills. Every adult ought to have a will, but it is
crucial for unmarried partners. Unless you have a will, a probate
court will pass your property along to your closest relatives.
Remember: In the eyes of the law, a spouse is a spouse, but an
unmarried partner is a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Do your estate planning. This can get complicated, and you may
want to consult a planner or an attorney. One issue is income and
estate taxes, which can be heavier on partners than on spouses.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing to look into is which partner owns which property.
Many experts suggest that real estate be owned in joint tenancy
with rights of survival.
</P>
<P>
   You also should make sure you have named the desired
beneficiaries for bank accounts, life insurance plans and
retirement plans such as individual retirement accounts. Burruss
and his partner have named each other in their documents.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Plan your retirement. Unmarried partners will probably need to
save more than married people. For one thing, the unmarrieds will
not be entitled to spousal Social Security benefits. In addition,
company pensions may not allow you to name an unmarried partner as
a beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   For unmarrieds, the whole process is do-it-yourself, and likely
to remain so as long as current laws make no provisions to protect
them. Don't hold your breath waiting for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot more people, at least in my community,
aggressively approaching these issues,'' Burruss observed. But for
the time being, he and his partner are relying on their own
arrangements.

 &HT;    Battling bacterias: Fighting the germs everywhere
 &HT;    By Stephanie Allmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Still working on breakfast? Better finish up.
We're gonna talk toilets.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's flush out myth from fact. While you can't catch
AIDS from a toilet seat and toilet paper won't get you pregnant,
dirty bathrooms breed bacteria and viruses linked to diseases from
the common cold to Hepatitis A, some bathroom experts say.
</P>
<P>
   But by taking a few precautions, they say, you can significantly
reduce chances of transmitting bathroom bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Gerba, a microbiologist at the University of Arizona in
Tucson, got down and dirty to examine the bathroom cooties for
himself. He swabbed and tested germs from public and private
bathrooms all over Arizona, and some of his findings have turned
heads, and stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   Gerba found that the most germ-laden areas in a public restroom
are not the stalls, but the sinks, where moisture encourages germ
colonies.
</P>
<P>
   That's no surprise to Winfred Watkins, a professor of biology at
McLennan Community College in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them need some kind of moisture to thrive,'' he said of
germ colonies. ``Any residual moisture is a breeding place for most
microorganisms.''
</P>
<P>
   Now if you're thinking of finding someplace new to store the
toothbrush, don't go near the floor, especially if it's carpeted.
Carpet is harder to disinfect, Watkins said, because disinfectants
can't be wiped off easily after they have penetrated the surface.
</P>
<P>
   As for toilets, the more use one gets, the more unsanitary it
will be, Gerba found.
</P>
<P>
   He actually rated public bathrooms and found that airport and
bus station restrooms are the least sanitary, while hospital
facilities are the cleanest. Women's rooms are twice as bad as
men's in terms of bacteria, he found, because women often bring
children into their restrooms. Middle stalls tend to be worse than
those on the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more traffic there is, the more potential (for bacteria)
there is,'' David Litke, environmental health supervisor for
Waco-McLennan County Public Health District, said. ``The worst
bathrooms are frequently used with minimum cleanup.''
</P>
<P>
   But the toilet seat _ the surface most women take great pains to
avoid by squatting or layering with toilet paper _ is relatively
harmless, Gerba found. He found that in homes, the average kitchen
cutting board has 200 times more fecal bacteria (mostly from raw
meat) than a toilet seat.
</P>
<P>
   And the germs associated with excrement and urine are harmless
unless they enter the body through one of the main ``portals of
entry,'' the mouth, nose or eyes, Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Litke said there is very little risk of acquiring a
blood-transmitted disease or a viral disease in a bathroom unless
the blood or bacteria are fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to all of it, regardless, is keeping your hands
clean,'' Litke said. ``Good handwashing is the best preventative
measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what is good handwashing? Soaping up and rubbing hands for
15 seconds, rinsing with water that's at least 110 degrees and
drying fully, Litke said. And you can forget those new dry hand
sanitizers, he said, because you still need water to wash away the
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Still not convinced handwashing helps? Think about how many
times you shake hands, touch your face or eat finger foods every
day, Watkins said. The fewer germs that make it out of the
bathroom, the fewer that wreak havoc in other places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you're in a very nasty situation, handwashing helps,''
Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   What if you are in a nasty situation? You have the right to
complain to the owner of the bathroom, but don't think drastic
changes are required.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Texas Health and Safety Code, operators of
public buildings, such as gas stations, schools, theaters and bars,
only have to ``provide and maintain sanitary toilet
accommodations.''

 &HT;    Wrestling's `unspeakable practices' also a proving ground for
guts
 &HT;    By The Practical Man
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The practical man met his betters last
week.
</P>
<P>
   At a wrestling tournament.
</P>
<P>
   No, he didn't get his butt kicked. And no, he's not a wrestling
fan.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for the practical man, wrestling is fraught with
mystery. For after attending approximately 19,500 matches involving
the Forest Hill High School wrestling team _ his oldest son is
their 135-pounder _ he has gleaned only the most cursory facts.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them is this: Wrestlers use portable CD players and
hard-core rap music to vaporize their minds before every bout. His
son denies this, but the practical man knows it to be true, for
under what other circumstances could seemingly normal teenage boys
be persuaded to don leotards and grope other guys while writhing on
a sweat-slathered rubber mat?
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling moms _ fearing injury for their precious babes _ worry
the loudest. But trust the practical man. It's wrestling dads who
are in the most pain, wincing as they watch the wretched jubilee of
unspeakable practices and unnatural acts.
</P>
<P>
   Another observation: Wrestling isn't about strength or skill _
it's about starvation.
</P>
<P>
   It is nothing for the practical man's son to lose 10 pounds in
one day to make his wrestling weight. He performs this deranged and
desperate miracle by suiting up in sweats lined with trash bags and
running 10 miles on a stomach that's been empty 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   It also makes sense to him to pump a ton of iron on the strength
of a single rice cake.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, wrestling logic is so twisted that it is commonplace for
a wan and wasted 103-pounder to swagger obscenely after pinning his
emaciated opponent _ even though everyone in the gym knows his
freshly fed sister could take him out with a single swat of her
hairbrush.
</P>
<P>
   Enough. The practical man could go on, but he would be wrong.
It's not that he doesn't have a point. He's just missing the one
that matters.
</P>
<P>
   He figured this out Jan. 22 at Wellington High School. His son
thought he might win the big tournament, and in fact, he was
winning in his last preliminary bout. But then he ``stepped over
the wizard'' or ``shot the outside leg'' or committed some other
arcane but mortal wrestling sin that meant instant defeat _ and he
was relegated to the consolation finals, where he would wrestle for
third place, without hope of first.
</P>
<P>
   As he slithered off the mat, head down, his coach _ a chiseled
chunk of obsidian with ferocious eyes and frightening intensity _
was in his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pitiful!
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't you think!?
</P>
<P>
   ``What is wrong with you?!
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times have we been over that!?''
</P>
<P>
   The boy bore the assault in humiliated silence. But his
passivity annoyed the practical man, who considered confronting the
coach by uttering a phrase with a pinch more pith than silence,
something along the lines of, say, ``SCREW YOU, BUDDY!'' But,
daunted by the mystery of the sport, the practical man kept his
mouth shut.
</P>
<P>
   In the consolation bout, the practical man's son, dejected and
disgusted with himself, lacked luster. He battled a lesser man
half-heartedly until, with 20 seconds to go, the score was tied.
The crowd, thin on Forest Hill fans, was screaming against him. The
coach and his parents were screaming for him. He went for victory,
lunging for the takedown that would score the winning points. But
something went wrong. Instead of bringing the other wrestler down,
he put himself in position to be brought down easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``NO!!!'' roared his coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``YEAH!!'' roared the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   And it was over, and suddenly the practical man found himself
with a very unpractical lump in his throat. His boy, doubly
defeated, ripped off his headgear, pounded the mat, then slinked
once more out of the ring. The boy's coach shook his head, waved
his arms, but this time patted him on the back before launching his
lecture on what his wrestler should have done. When the yelling
subsided, the practical man left the stands to comfort his kid, who
sat grieving against a gym wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damn!'' he croaked, patting his shoulder. ``You had him
beat!''
</P>
<P>
   Silence. Head between knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were this close!''
</P>
<P>
   Nodding. Head between knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be too hard on yourself, son,'' said the practical man.
``There'll be many more days.''
</P>
<P>
   The head came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about it, Dad. I don't let little stuff like that
bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   And there it was. All the sweating and starving and hollering
isn't to build the body, or even the mind. Wrestling is a crash
course in heart.
</P>
<P>
   WE GET LETTERS
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man: I love your column! I don't always agree
with your opinion, but I do always get a laugh when I read it.
</P>
<P>
   How about a Practical Woman column? I would love to be Practical
Woman. Does your paper have any plans to do something like this? _
Sincerely, Wendi Ladika

 &HT;    Battling bacterias: Fighting the germs everywhere
 &HT;    By Stephanie Allmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Still working on breakfast? Better finish up.
We're gonna talk toilets.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's flush out myth from fact. While you can't catch
AIDS from a toilet seat and toilet paper won't get you pregnant,
dirty bathrooms breed bacteria and viruses linked to diseases from
the common cold to Hepatitis A, some bathroom experts say.
</P>
<P>
   But by taking a few precautions, they say, you can significantly
reduce chances of transmitting bathroom bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Gerba, a microbiologist at the University of Arizona in
Tucson, got down and dirty to examine the bathroom cooties for
himself. He swabbed and tested germs from public and private
bathrooms all over Arizona, and some of his findings have turned
heads, and stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   Gerba found that the most germ-laden areas in a public restroom
are not the stalls, but the sinks, where moisture encourages germ
colonies.
</P>
<P>
   That's no surprise to Winfred Watkins, a professor of biology at
McLennan Community College in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them need some kind of moisture to thrive,'' he said of
germ colonies. ``Any residual moisture is a breeding place for most
microorganisms.''
</P>
<P>
   Now if you're thinking of finding someplace new to store the
toothbrush, don't go near the floor, especially if it's carpeted.
Carpet is harder to disinfect, Watkins said, because disinfectants
can't be wiped off easily after they have penetrated the surface.
</P>
<P>
   As for toilets, the more use one gets, the more unsanitary it
will be, Gerba found.
</P>
<P>
   He actually rated public bathrooms and found that airport and
bus station restrooms are the least sanitary, while hospital
facilities are the cleanest. Women's rooms are twice as bad as
men's in terms of bacteria, he found, because women often bring
children into their restrooms. Middle stalls tend to be worse than
those on the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more traffic there is, the more potential (for bacteria)
there is,'' David Litke, environmental health supervisor for
Waco-McLennan County Public Health District, said. ``The worst
bathrooms are frequently used with minimum cleanup.''
</P>
<P>
   But the toilet seat _ the surface most women take great pains to
avoid by squatting or layering with toilet paper _ is relatively
harmless, Gerba found. He found that in homes, the average kitchen
cutting board has 200 times more fecal bacteria (mostly from raw
meat) than a toilet seat.
</P>
<P>
   And the germs associated with excrement and urine are harmless
unless they enter the body through one of the main ``portals of
entry,'' the mouth, nose or eyes, Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Litke said there is very little risk of acquiring a
blood-transmitted disease or a viral disease in a bathroom unless
the blood or bacteria are fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to all of it, regardless, is keeping your hands
clean,'' Litke said. ``Good handwashing is the best preventative
measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what is good handwashing? Soaping up and rubbing hands for
15 seconds, rinsing with water that's at least 110 degrees and
drying fully, Litke said. And you can forget those new dry hand
sanitizers, he said, because you still need water to wash away the
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Still not convinced handwashing helps? Think about how many
times you shake hands, touch your face or eat finger foods every
day, Watkins said. The fewer germs that make it out of the
bathroom, the fewer that wreak havoc in other places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you're in a very nasty situation, handwashing helps,''
Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   What if you are in a nasty situation? You have the right to
complain to the owner of the bathroom, but don't think drastic
changes are required.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Texas Health and Safety Code, operators of
public buildings, such as gas stations, schools, theaters and bars,
only have to ``provide and maintain sanitary toilet
accommodations.''

 &HT;    Hypnosis Can be Helpful Part II
 &HT;    By Dr. Hap LeCrone
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Many individuals experience a hypnotic-like state
on a daily basis, being so focused and intensively involved in
something that they are unaware of any competing thoughts or
activities.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the individual in deep thought while driving toward
a particular destination may find that he or she has passed the
destination many minutes or miles before, thus experiencing a
phenomena known as ``road hypnosis.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, in another example, a child is so transfixed on a television
show that he or she does not hear a parent repeatedly calling him
or her to dinner. The child is also in an altered state of
consciousness and trance-like state akin to hypnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the very persuasive sales person, politician or
entertainer has often developed a style of communication that
encourages intense focus on their message and suggestions. The
recipient of that message becomes completely enthralled and
captivated and this increases the likelihood that the recipient
will think, feel or behave in the manner suggested to them. Some
experts believe that a form of hypnosis is present in these
situations.
</P>
<P>
   Hypnosis has many medical and psychological uses, including the
following:
</P>
<P>
   _ Stress management. Hypnosis can help the individual learn to
manage tension and reduce psychological reactivity thus lowering
blood pressure, promoting healthy sleep patterns and coping better
with the fast pace of modern society.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pain management. Hypnosis can help individuals alter their
perception of bodily sensations so that pain is perceived in a less
excruciating manner. The goal in pain management is not to make
pain disappear but instead to change the individual's perception of
the painful sensations so that they can better accomplish desired
activities. Self-hypnosis can help the individual learn to continue
to develop and enhance his or her own pain modification program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Habit control. Smoking, eating disorders and other
compulsive-like behaviors can often be altered through the use of
hypnosis. These techniques, when practiced regularly in the form of
self-hypnosis, can decrease the likelihood of relapse back into the
undesirable behavior pattern of smoking, overeating, etc.
</P>
<P>
   _ Assistance in concentration and memory. Hypnosis can enhance
the ability to recall past events in certain instances. It can
assist persons wishing to decrease distractibility and increase
their ability to focus their attention such as in study situations
or speech preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Benefit from hypnosis is enhanced when conducted by a trained
professional. The skills and techniques necessary to make hypnosis
effective in healthcare and psychology is generally derived from
training in medicine, psychology and dentistry.
</P>

 &HT;    The crying game: What to do about tantrums
 &HT;    By Christine Moran
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ Peggy Marshall was in the supermarket with
her 3-year-old daughter, Jessica.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica had missed her nap that day, so she was feeling tired.
While sitting in the front of the shopping cart, Jessica reached
out and grabbed a box of Golden Grahams.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' her mother said. But, Jessica didn't want to hear no.
Tears immediately shot out of her eyes. She started screaming,
flailing her arms and kicking into the air. Her face turned purple.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of onlookers swarmed to the cereal aisle. Some laughed.
Others just turned their heads and looked in a different direction.
They were parents, too. They knew the embarrassment Marshall felt.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of tantrums. The good news is that all
normal children go through them. The bad news is that all normal
children go through them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are smart, but parents need to be smarter,'' said Victor
Jones, an outpatient therapist with Coastal Plain Hospital and
Counseling Center in Rocky Mount. ``Don't give in to your child's
demands. Instead, set some boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just what Marshall did. She put the box of Golden Grahams
back on the shelf and continued her business. She passed through
the crowd of onlookers as if nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not what she wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, I wanted to leave both my kid and the cart in
the aisle and take off running,'' Marshall said. ``But I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Tantrums usually start around age 2. They're a response to
frustration. They're much more likely to occur when the child is
hungry, tired, sick or just not getting enough attention.
</P>
<P>
   If tantrums aren't put to an immediate halt, they could last
well into a person's adult years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tantrum is a learned behavior,'' Jones said. ``If a child
throws a tantrum and gets rewarded for it, that child will continue
throwing tantrums. That child will then turn into an adolescent and
then an adult who throws tantrums in order to get what he or she
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just what Marshall is afraid of. Her 10-year-old son,
James, still throws tantrums, and there's no sign that he'll stop
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica learned about tantrums by watching her older brother.
Whenever he wants something, he holds his breath till he gets it.
Sometimes, he even starts banging his head against the wall. And,
usually, it works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admit it. James gets away with a lot,'' Marshall said. ``I'm
working on correcting that situation, though. I'm starting to get
tough. I'm starting to say 'no' and really mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   Children are good judges of character. They know who they can
throw a tantrum with and who they can't, or rather who will let
them get away with it and who won't.
</P>
<P>
   One parent is usually more easy-going than the other. That's the
parent who most often has the pleasure of watching his or her child
throw a tantrum.
</P>
<P>
   Kids will experiment. It's only natural for them to try to see
what they can get away with, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The skill with which parents handle tantrums can make a big
difference in how quickly they're eliminated from a child's
behavior. Poor handling of tantrums, such as punishment or giving
in, can cause tantrums to be prolonged. A child might even go to
school with an inappropriate set of expectations, which could lead
to problems with teachers and other students.
</P>
<P>
   A good rule of thumb is ``just walk away,'' Jones said. And
while you're walking away from the scene of the crime, try to think
beyond the moment. Think about where the tantrum is coming from.
Try to find its root.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe your child is hungry, thirsty, tired or sick. It may be
difficult to pinpoint the problem, because oftentimes children
don't have the appropriate tools to express their anger or
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   It's best just to avoid the tantrum in the first place. Easier
said than done, right? Not according to Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your child gets cranky at nap time, you know you're taking
a risk by taking him shopping when he should be at home sleeping,''
he said. ``If you have to go somewhere, bring something with you
that the child likes, maybe a favorite blanket or a container of
Cheerios. It's not like you're giving in. You're just trying to
prevent the onset of an uncomfortable situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is don't try to end a tantrum by giving your
child what he or she wants. This just tells the child that tantrums
work.
</P>
<P>
   What you can do is talk to your child. Explain what the
consequences will be if he throws a tantrum. And when the time
comes, don't be afraid to put your words into action.
</P>

Journal-Constitution). 25.

<P>
   FAT-KIDS _ Lauren Leary still remembers the words that changed
her life. ``Get out of the way, Fatso.'' She was 17, at the beach
and in line to use the shower when an overbearing guy elbowed her
aside as if she didn't exist. Suddenly, all the years of struggling
with her weight piled up on her. (Susman, Palm Beach Post). 70.

   PRUNING-TIPS _ The first warm days in February will find many of
us restless to get outside and do something _ anything _ to hurry
spring along. Pruning makes us feel like we're helping, and
fortunately, now's the perfect time to tackle many trees, shrubs
and perennials. Yet every year well-meaning gardeners pick up the
shears at the wrong time. Or make the wrong kind of cut. Before you
get a grip on those things, you must understand the what, when, why
and how of pruning. (Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) WITH

   The breakdown ...
</P>
<P>
   `ONE HUNDRED, TWO HUNDRED MILLION ...' On the topic of the
upcoming census, two projections are meaningful, writes columnist
Raoul Lowery Contreras. One is that the number of seniors will
increase significantly _ from the present 34.6 million to 82
million in 2050. The Census Bureau also projects that the number of
immigrants will increase to 53.8 million in 2050, from 26 million
today. The combination of immigrants and young Hispanics will be of
huge value to an America with a median age of 40. In other words,
the work force will be made up mostly of Hispanics and immigrants.
Blacks, Asians and non-Hispanic whites will be minority segments of
the work force, Contreras writes.
</P>
<P>
   FORGOTTEN FAMILY VALUES. ``In a better world, this titanic
battle over the fate of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez would have ended
long ago,'' writes columnist Juan Gonzalez. ``There is no contest
in this custody battle. Grandmothers ... are the central figures of
every Latino family. They ... care for the youngest children when
their parents go off to work, pamper them with affection while the
parents stumble through life and provide them solace and comfort
when the parents separate, divorce or die,'' he adds. In this
commentary, Gonzalez denounces the actions of Elian's U.S.
relatives and discusses why he feels Elian should be sent back to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   40 ACRES AND A MULE PLUS INTEREST. ``It's the year 2000 and we
are still discussing the same thing we did in 1865 _ reparations
for African-Americans,'' writes columnist Akilah Monifa. It's not
that the discussion has been constant for the past 135 years. On
the contrary, we spend most of our time refusing to discuss the
issue. Since 1989, Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich) has introduced a
bill every legislative session to establish a commission to examine
slavery and its lingering effects on African-Americans and
contemporary U.S. society. The organization, comprised of
historians, legal scholars, genealogists, economists and lawmakers,
would start the conversation over reparations by asking a few key
questions: (1) Should the U.S. government issue a formal apology
for sanctioning slavery? and (2) Is a debt owed to the descendants
of slaves who helped build this country without compensation? In
this commentary, Monifa explains why such a commission should be
instituted.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S AT STAKE IN CALIFORNIA'S ANTI-GAY PROP. 22. Fourteen
words in Proposition 22 could change state law, triggering a
national backlash against gay civil rights: ``Only marriage between
a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.'' With
public opinion holding steady; campaign war chests overflowing; and
politicians, celebrities and interest groups lining up to oppose
it, Prop. 22 has become the major gay civil-rights battleground of
the primary season, writes columnist Chuck Colbert. If it passes,
what's at stake? Recent gains in gay civil rights, including
lesbian and gay parenting and adoption rights, domestic-partnership
registrations, health-insurance benefits and anti-discrimination
laws.
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT ON ... OSCAR DE LA RENTA. What is Oscar de la Renta's
favorite book? What does he like most about his job? What is his
most recent accomplishment? What does he feel is the most pressing
issue that Hispanic-Americans face? These are just a few of the
questions we asked this international clothing designer in this
original entertainment feature from New America News Service.
``Spotlight On ...'' is available as a formatted page -- in an
eye-catching layout with text and art.

   `ONE HUNDRED, TWO HUNDRED MILLION ...' On the topic of the
upcoming census, two projections are meaningful, writes columnist
Raoul Lowery Contreras. One is that the number of seniors will
increase significantly _ from the present 34.6 million to 82
million in 2050. The Census Bureau also projects that the number of
immigrants will increase to 53.8 million in 2050, from 26 million
today. The combination of immigrants and young Hispanics will be of
huge value to an America with a median age of 40. In other words,
the work force will be made up mostly of Hispanics and immigrants.
Blacks, Asians and non-Hispanic whites will be minority segments of
the work force, Contreras writes.

   FORGOTTEN FAMILY VALUES. ``In a better world, this titanic
battle over the fate of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez would have ended
long ago,'' writes columnist Juan Gonzalez. ``There is no contest
in this custody battle. Grandmothers ... are the central figures of
every Latino family. They ... care for the youngest children when
their parents go off to work, pamper them with affection while the
parents stumble through life and provide them solace and comfort
when the parents separate, divorce or die,'' he adds. In this
commentary, Gonzalez denounces the actions of Elian's U.S.
relatives and discusses why he feels Elian should be sent back to
Cuba.

<P>
   40 ACRES AND A MULE PLUS INTEREST. ``It's the year 2000 and we
are still discussing the same thing we did in 1865 _ reparations
for African-Americans,'' writes columnist Akilah Monifa. It's not
that the discussion has been constant for the past 135 years. On
the contrary, we spend most of our time refusing to discuss the
issue. Since 1989, Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich) has introduced a
bill every legislative session to establish a commission to examine
slavery and its lingering effects on African-Americans and
contemporary U.S. society. The organization, comprised of
historians, legal scholars, genealogists, economists and lawmakers,
would start the conversation over reparations by asking a few key
questions: (1) Should the U.S. government issue a formal apology
for sanctioning slavery? and (2) Is a debt owed to the descendants
of slaves who helped build this country without compensation? In
this commentary, Monifa explains why such a commission should be
instituted.

   WHAT'S AT STAKE IN CALIFORNIA'S ANTI-GAY PROP. 22. Fourteen
words in Proposition 22 could change state law, triggering a
national backlash against gay civil rights: ``Only marriage between
a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.'' With
public opinion holding steady; campaign war chests overflowing; and
politicians, celebrities and interest groups lining up to oppose
it, Prop. 22 has become the major gay civil-rights battleground of
the primary season, writes columnist Chuck Colbert. If it passes,
what's at stake? Recent gains in gay civil rights, including
lesbian and gay parenting and adoption rights, domestic-partnership
registrations, health-insurance benefits and anti-discrimination
laws.

SCIENTISTS FIND STATE'S LARGEST DINOSAUR EVER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The largest dinosaur fossils ever found in Texas _ and
the world's largest sauropod from the late Cretaceous Period _ have
been found in Big Bend National Park by scientists from the
University of Texas at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   It is either an unusually large member of a dinosaur family
known as alamosaurus or an entirely new species, according to Dr.
James Carter of UTD's department of geosciences, who found the
first fossilized fragments of the animal's neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have been 100 feet to 130 feet long, depending on the
body style,'' Carter said. ``That would rival the giant dinosaurs
thought to be extinct by the end of the early Cretaceous Period,
some 32 million years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Cretaceous Period extended from 65 million to 135 million
years ago and was characterized by the development of flowering
plants and the disappearance of dinosaurs. The largest vanished
early in that period and it was believed all had died out by around
100 million years ago, Carter said. The Big Bend find, however, is
dated to about 65 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Homer Montgomery, of UTD's department of science education,
said the nearest relative of the Big Bend creature is from
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, we want to know not only why this big guy existed, but how
it got here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery and his students had been excavating the remains of a
juvenile alamosaurus since 1995 when, at a nearby site, Carter
discovered evidence of the larger specimen. He and two colleagues
began digging at that location early in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   By autumn, they had found 10 articulated neck vertebrae that,
together, measure 23 feet in length.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before has an articulated neck of this length and
quality of preservation been found anywhere in the world from the
Cretaceous Period,'' Carter said. ``It is extremely rare. Only a
partial cervical vertebrae of an adult alamosaurid has been found
before in the late Cretaceous.''
</P>
<P>
   The head and first two vertebrae appear to be missing, but other
adult sauropod bones, including dorsal vertebrae, ribs and partial
sacrum have been found nearby and may be part of the same giant
dinosaur, Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   The dinosaur is lying on its left side in a curved position.
That suggests it was buried soon after its death, which may account
for the quality of its preservation. The bones are encased in a
calcite-rich coating up to three inches thick, Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the smaller fossils, which weigh up to 467 pounds, have
been removed, but others, which weigh up to 1,200 pounds, remain at
the site.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicles are prohibited in the wilderness area of the park where
the fossils were found. A method of removing them will not be
determined until after the National Park Service completes an
environmental impact study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do an assessment and look at the options,'' said Mark
Flippo, a park spokesman. ``We will have to determine what the
impact on the area will be.''
</P>
<P>
   One possibility, he said, is lifting them out by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   The next step will be to compare them with previously unearthed
alamosaurus fossils to determine if they are the same species or
one not previously known.

YES, MORE NATIONAL MONUMENTS ON THE HORIZON 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the 
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c.2000 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   We can
expect President Clinton to designate more national monuments
before he leaves office. Public support has been overwhelming for
his latest designations.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt
made it clear that other national monuments are being considered:
``There aren't going to be any surprises. There's no master list in
a file somewhere. But what the president has asked me to do is
where there is interest, expressed interest, to get out on the
ground and talk the issues through. And I've been doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the interview, Babbitt emphasized that these potential
sites are still in the talking stage: ``What we're doing is
responding to specific opportunities that are put up to us by local
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   In selecting potential sites for national monument status, the
Department of the Interior also looks at land use for the prior 10
years in terms of development and mining.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon is a possible site of two new national monuments. Babbitt
plans to meet with the entire congressional delegation and the
governor about protecting Steens Mountain and Soda Mountain. Steens
Mountain, a geological wonder, is located in southeastern Oregon.
The Soda Mountain region, southeast of Ashland, has been long
recognized for its ecological significance, but faces the threats
posed by a jeep trail and the use of off-road vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said that they are all ``interested in putting together
legislation. And what I'm saying, that's fine. The issue is not
arguing about is it Congress or the president. The issue is
protecting our heritage. And in Oregon, I think we have an
excellent chance of getting a consensus bill worked out between the
delegation and the governor that will have administration support.
Such a bill, would by its own terms make the designation either as
a national monument or as a national conservation area.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt has made three visits to Colorado and had discussions
with the delegation. The Department of the Interior has held public
meetings on the sites of interest: Canyon of the Ancients near
Cortez in southwest Colorado, the expansion of the Colorado
National Monument west of Grand Junction, and the possible
expansion of the Great Sand Dunes National Monument 25 miles
northeast of Alamosa.
</P>
<P>
   According to Babbitt, the expansion of the Great Sand Dunes
National Monument has the support of Colorado's congressional
delegation and the state attorney general. Actually, one member of
Colorado's congressional delegation brought the idea of monument's
expansion to Babbitt. There has been talk of expanding the site as
a national park.
</P>
<P>
   President Herbert Hoover designated the Great Sand Dunes
National Monument in 1932. The original boundary was further
enlarged through proclamations by presidents Harry Truman and
Dwight D. Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Babbitt has also discussed two potential national
monument sites with the state's congressional delegation: the Santa
Rosa Mountains near Palm Springs and the Carrizo Plain located in
the San Joaquin Valley near Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of presidential proclamations to make them national
monuments, Congress may offer legislation to protect those sites.
That would be the best scenario, according to Babbitt. Local
residents support special protection for these sites.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona may become home to another national monument, the Empire
Ranch near Tucson. The ranch has been administered by the Bureau of
Land Management since 1988. It encompasses a vast grasslands area
with a rich diversity of wildlife that is now threatened by
commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   And in Montana _ where the Missouri River begins its long
journey _ the river and other geological forces created the
Missouri Breaks at the Upper Missouri River, a landscape of unique,
white bluffs. There are discussions underway to see if there is
support to protect the Missouri Breaks as a national monument.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, after President Clinton designated the Grand
Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southeast Utah, Congress
attempted to limit the president's power under the Antiquities Act.
A bill to do just that passed the U.S. House, but failed in the
Senate even with the support of Utah's powerful Republican Sen.
Orrin Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., promises to introduce a bill in this
Congress to limit the power of the president under the Antiquities
Act. No doubt there will be some members of Congress who will go
along, but it is doubtful that such legislation will pass in an
election year when the public solidly supports the protection of
such national treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Antiquities Act of 1906 was passed into law, 14
presidents _ seven Republicans and seven Democrats _ have used its
power to designate important sites as national monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the act had to be used swiftly to protect a site, as
was the case of the Muir Woods National Monument in California.
President Theodore Roosevelt acted in a mere 12 days after being
apprised of the threat to the redwood trees. Congress could not
have acted that quickly.
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to attack the Antiquities Act. Congress passed
the act and it can undo any presidential proclamation of a national
monument it doesn't like by simply passing legislation to abolish
its status as a monument. Of the 106 national monuments created by
presidents, six have been abolished by congressional action. One of
those, the Gran Quivira National Monument in New Mexico, 80 years
later was redesignated as the Salinas Pueblo Missions National
Monument.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who was raised on a ranch near Cody, Wyo., ought to know
that Congress can abolish any particular site's status as a
national monument. In 1909, President William Taft designated the
Shoshone Cavern National Monument, a 210-acre site adjacent to
Cody. The designation was abolished by Congress in 1954 and the
cave and acreage was given to the city of Cody to be used as a
public park. The park was never successfully developed and reverted
back to the federal government in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The West's 100-year-old antagonism to public lands, federal
oversight of those lands and the Antiquities Act hasn't diminished.
But neither has urban growth and encroachment upon special public
landscapes diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, members of Congress from the West will have to
learn to live with the new national monuments. The nation, as a
whole, sees the need for special protection of certain selected
sites that are located on federal public lands.
</P>
<P>
   The American public has spoken clearly in poll after poll -- the
public lands are to be protected. The designation of national
monuments is one way to give greater protection to an area of
scientific or historic interest or of great and unusual beauty.

D'ANGELO MIXES JAZZ, FUNK, BLUES IN `VOODOO' 
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   By MICHAEL D. CLARK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael ``D'Angelo'' Archer must be impervious to reviews like
this. After facing down the unforgiving crowds at New York City's
Apollo Theater and winning three amateur-night awards before he was
18, he had already tamed the beast of all critics.
</P>
<P>
   With the innovative blend of jazz, R&AMP;B and hip-hop he's laying
on his sophomore album, ``Voodoo,'' he has little to worry about in
the way of criticism.
</P>
<P>
   D'Angelo is among a group of young black artists _ Macy Gray,
Erykah Badu, the Roots and former A Tribe Called Quest member Q-Tip
_ who are the nucleus for change in contemporary urban music and
romantic R&AMP;B.
</P>
<P>
   And the future looks exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing from a blend of influences from the past is a recurring
theme through ``Voodoo,'' though no song grabs from exactly the
same genre. Opener ``Playa Playa'' is sweaty R&AMP;B propelled by a
cool jazz trumpet line. A few songs later, ``Send It On'' is a sexy
funk frolic followed by the blues juke-joint improv of ``Chicken
Grease.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the structured studio work of ``Brown Sugar,'' D'Angelo's
2-million-selling debut, ``Voodoo'' is like a loose jam between
friends caught on tape. And that's quite a jam when the friends are
jazz trumpeter Roy Hargrove, guitarist Charlie Hunter and songbird
Lauryn Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Recorded live, all the inter-song banter and uncontrollable
snickering has been documented. It gives the album a feel of
listening to songs evolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Root'' pitches a hip-hop beat over a soft guitar loop by
Hunter, while ``Spanish Joint'' merges island beats with retro-funk
hooks that sound like something Prince would have concocted
pre-``Purple Rain.'' And D'Angelo and Hill's disco cover of Feel
Like Makin' Love is a precious bit of fluff bound for some lucky
soundtrack.

BE SMART ON SNOW FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a nonskier, I always envied friends for their unbridled
enthusiasm in preparing for an annual midwinter vacation on the
slopes.
</P>
<P>
   And I empathized year after year when one or more returned home
on crutches, nursing a twisted ankle or broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   Injury seemed part of the ritual _ almost a badge of courage.
But times have changed. Although accidents to high-profile
individuals _ most notably the deaths of Michael Kennedy and Sonny
Bono _ have generated widespread attention, ski safety is stressed
today as never before. And with positive results.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BROKEN LEGS RARE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One study, as reported by Dr. Jasper Shealy of the Rochester
Institute of Technology, found that the overall rate of reported
injuries has declined by 50 percent over the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Especially remarkable is that incidents of broken lower legs in
skiing have declined more than 95 percent since the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are concerns. While few skiers now end their
vacations wearing a leg cast _ thanks in part to improvements in
bindings and boots and an increased emphasis on overall safety _ an
alarming trend involves injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament
of the knees. A University of Vermont study determined that a
skier's chance of incurring an ACL injury is about the same as that
of a college football player and about 365 times greater than that
of the general public.
</P>
<P>
   Ski-related thumb injuries and snowboarder injuries to wrists
and shoulders also remain bothersome.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ACCIDENTS PREVENTABLE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the ski industry is forging a united effort to stress that
many of these injuries, too, are preventable if participants heed
common-sense precautions and utilize good judgment and courtesy.
</P>
<P>
   Resorts throughout the United States, in conjunction with the
National Ski Areas Association, or NSAA, participated earlier this
month in a National Safety Awareness Week that featured special
events and promotions.
</P>
<P>
   On a more lasting basis, the NSAA, National Ski Patrol,
Professional Ski Instructors of America and American Association of
Snowboard Instructors have jointly launched a Safety Initiative
2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our skiers and snowboarders to understand that we care
about them and their safety,'' says Tim White, the NSAA's director
of education. ``Collectively, we have to take a pro-active approach
and creatively educate our guests, employees and the media about
safety issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Some resort areas already were at the forefront in these
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We initiated the first risk-management program in the United
States in 1984,'' says Joan Christensen, communications director at
Winter Park Resort in Colorado. ``It's based on education. As part
of the program, skier education teams go out in pairs. If they see
somebody going too fast, for example, team members talk with the
skiers and explain that they are on a congested area and urge them
to be careful and observant.''
</P>
<P>
   One paradox: Winter sports have evolved in recent years into an
affordable and popular family vacation alternative. Children under
18, by some estimates, represent 25 percent of all skiers and 50
percent of snowboarders. Among adults, more novices are taking
advantage of bargain packages as resorts scramble to survive in an
increasingly competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the Rochester Institute of Technology study,
most injury victims aren't newcomers; they are better-than-average
skiers hurt while skiing at high rates of speed on the margins of
intermediate trails. About 85 percent are male, and 70 percent
range in age from their late teens to late 20s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Christensen says, ``The problems that lead to injuries
don't usually develop because people are out there being jerks.
It's often because they're over their heads. If they need help, we
offer to give them a free lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   On rare occasions when guests are not receptive to learning or
flagrantly ignore safety procedures, Christensen says, ``We tape a
red flag over their pass. If they're caught again, they can lose
their privileges. Then, we give them a chance to regain those
privileges by attending a skier education class that we conduct
every day. There they watch a video that pertains to their
misdemeanor.''
</P>
<P>
   Other resorts have adopted similar patrol programs. Many
designate established family ski areas. Beginner lessons are
encouraged for snowboarders.
</P>
<P>
   Use of helmets also is increasing, although wearers are urged to
make certain a helmet fits properly, is comfortable and offers
appropriate protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We caution people not to feel that they are invincible just
because of the helmet,'' Christensen says. ``Helmets can help
prevent mild concussions but are only effective when skiing up to
10-12 mph, and most intermediate skiers go 20 mph. One concern,
too, is that a helmet can limit hearing ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Christensen suggests that some injuries can be avoided if skiers
use proper decorum. ``I see a decline in common courtesy on the
slopes,'' she says. ``And I think it mirrors what's happening on
our highways and in other aspects of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The NSAA has established a ``Your Responsibility Code'' that
most resorts make available to guests. The code urges skiers and
snowboarders to observe these guidelines:
</P>
<P>
   _ Always stay in control.
</P>
<P>
   _ People ahead of you have the right of way.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stop in a safe place for you and others.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whenever starting downhill or merging, look uphill and yield.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use devices to help prevent runaway equipment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Observe signs and warnings, and keep off closed trails.
</P>
<P>
   _ Know how to use lifts safely.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet sites of NSAA (www.nsaa.org) and the National Ski
Patrol (www.nsp.org) are good sources for more ski safety
information.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Already famous for its 10,000 lakes, Minnesota may soon be known
for its falls.
</P>
<P>
   Not the watery cascades. We're talking falls as in ``ouch.''
</P>
<P>
   Zephyr Inline Skate Tours is inviting beginning skaters to Skate
Camp this summer in Minnesota's charming Root River Valley. The
camps are a first for the Minneapolis-based company, which has been
leading tours to picturesque destinations such as the Netherlands,
Switzerland and Massachusetts' Martha's Vineyard for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Zephyr's standard tours are geared for all levels of ability
(advanced beginner to expert) with skaters choosing routes of 12,
20 or 30 miles per day. Skate Camps, however, will emphasize skills
over miles. The goal is for participants to learn with skaters of
similar abilities in a non-competitive climate.
</P>
<P>
   For the beginning skater, it's good to know you won't be the
only person falling down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go ahead and fall,'' Zephyr president Allan Wright says
to a wobbly beginner. ``You need to learn to fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, falling isn't so bad on a Zephyr tour. The outfitter
insists that participants wear protective gear at all times.
Helmets and wrist guards are required, and most skaters take
further precautions with elbow and knee pads.
</P>
<P>
   Falling, the beginner learns, is one way to stop. It is not
stylish, but it is effective. The Wright way to fall is forward,
allowing the knee pads and wrist guards to absorb the impact.
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, there is really only one person _ me _ falling a
lot during a 1999 tour for ``beginners.'' Most of the 10 people
gathered in Minnesota for the tour are not true beginners. They
have many miles behind them, but are looking to learn or improve
techniques such as turns, scissoring, skating backward and
negotiating curbs.
</P>
<P>
   Most too are unsure of their skills. They want to measure their
ability against others before signing up for a regular skate tour.
</P>
<P>
   The nine women and one man betray their ``beginner''
classification the first day of the tour. They breeze through a
two-mile warm-up skate at a Minneapolis park, then jump at a chance
for another spin around the park's pretty lake.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the week features skates of varying lengths on
shaded trails around the southern Minnesota cities of Red Wing and
Lanesboro. The pace is relaxed. Nights are spent in historic hotels
or friendly inns. The meals may not be gourmet, but they are always
tasty.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the trails are former railway lines and run along a
creek or river's edge. Wildflowers dot the landscape, and crickets
and big brown caterpillars vie for space on the gloriously flat and
smoothly paved trails.
</P>
<P>
   The skaters all move at their own pace. Every day a new speed
demon emerges and most everyone takes a turn as straggler. But
outings are never a race because that is not what Zephyr is about.
</P>
<P>
   Company founder Wright is an adventurer. When he is not leading
tours, he's climbing mountains or kayaking, or scouting other tour
destinations. His travels have taken him to more than 45 countries,
and he has lived in Poland, Germany and Thailand. For the wiry
34-year-old, skating is as much a lifestyle choice as recreation.
</P>
<P>
   Zephyr tours encourage fitness, relaxation and cultural
understanding. In the Netherlands, participants join the locals on
evening skates. On tours in Pennsylvania, skaters share back roads
with horse-drawn buggies, then sit down to Amish meals served
family-style.
</P>
<P>
   (That's a Wright signature. The Seattle native believes that
tour members should eat all meals together. It is part of his push
to create a convivial atmosphere.)
</P>
<P>
   Wright also spends a lot of time selecting guides. Among them is
a 75-year-old skater, Willem Augustin, in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The fall trip was led by Wright and Mike Merriman.
Minneapolis-native Merriman, whose day job is in finance for
General Mills, is a natural instructor, at once patient and
pertinent. Merriman, who has only been inline skating for about
five years, amazes tour participants with his aggressive blading
skills. He is not a ``hot dog,'' but shines the way you do when
you're really good at doing something you love.
</P>
<P>
   Merriman will be one of two instructors at the Skate Camps. He
will be joined by Liz Miller, a San Francisco-area fitness
enthusiast and author of ``Get Rolling: The Beginner's Guide to
In-Line Skating'' (McGraw-Hill, $13.95).
</P>
<P>
   Five-day Skate Camp I begins July 15 and will be a women-only
affair. Never-ever skaters will learn about safety equipment,
stretching and striding techniques as they move from grass drills
to the trail.
</P>
<P>
   Skate Camp II, also five days, is open to men and women and is
for the advanced beginner. Wright says participants should be
skilled enough to skate several miles, but they don't have to be
comfortable stopping.
</P>
<P>
   They always can fall _ my preferred braking technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camp should be a wonderful opportunity for anybody who really
wants to add inline skating and all its potential benefits to their
lifestyle but is fearful,'' says instructor Miller, whose new book,
``Advance Inline Skate'' will be published in April by McGraw-Hill.
``Even non-fearful beginners should see this as a really great way
to have a totally unique and active vacation with big bragging
points.''
</P>
<P>
   Dedicating a week to learning and then practicing new skills
will benefit first-time skaters, says Miller, who also offers
blading tips on her Web site: www.getrolling.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can not only get the basics, but start building the
confidence and coordination that can only result from lots of hours
on skates,'' Miller says.
</P>
<P>
   An enthusiastic snow skier and backpacker as well as blader,
Miller describes herself as an empathic instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unspoken tone is, `We're all tottering around for the
first time together _ isn't it fun to be like a kid again?' I make
sure nobody feels like the class klutz, and encourage people not to
compare themselves with others because everybody's got to start
somewhere,'' says Miller, who slipped on her first pair of inline
skates at age 39.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared for the first six months; I didn't learn how to
brake for the first nine,'' says the 49-year-old Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Inline skating is the fastest growing sport in America,
according to separate surveys by the Sporting Goods Manufacturers
and the National Sporting Goods Association. SGMA's latest report
showed 29.1 million Americans donning inline skates, a figure up
5.6 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   And Miller says, judging by her client list, quite a few of
those skaters are over 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who want to get out of running are looking at inline
skating,'' Miller says. ``They're dropping their fears.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they're not just heading to the park without
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maturity breeds intelligence,'' Miller quips, adding that it
is the 45-60 age group that is more likely to take the weekend
lessons she offers.
</P>
<P>
   While Miller has led seasoned skaters on Zephyr tours around
California and in the Netherlands, she is eager to work with Skate
Camp's beginners.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Skate Camp, we'll all get to know each other on equal
footing, and even if some (participants) are athletically inclined
and others not, they'll bond within the first hour because that's
the most humbling one. We always laugh a lot as I let people know
their fears are very normal and will soon learn skills to help
conquer them,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In the private lessons she offers near her Danville, Calif.,
home, Miller explains, her first priority is building her student's
confidence as they get rolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel empowered,'' she says, and ``I feel wonderful that
I've given them this gift. The opportunity to do that for a week
(at Skate Camp) is exciting.'' &QL;

   EATING-DISORDERS (Albany, N.Y.) _ Experts caution that eating
disorders are more pervasive than ever, especially among young
children, ages 9 to 12, who in the past weren't considered at risk.
Despite some promising research, even the best treatments don't
work unless the eating disorders are identified early. That's the

February, with more than 1,000 high schools, colleges and community
locations offering free, anonymous screenings for eating disorders.

   Forget calorie counting and meal planning. The latest dietary
fad from the United States lets God take care of everything.
</P>
<P>
   Just kneel down, pray and watch the pounds melt away _ advice
taken to heart by an escalating number of the oversize faithful in
Britain, where more than 50 groups have been set up to follow what
is dubbed the Bible diet.
</P>
<P>
   They are eager to learn how to ``transform this desire for a pan
of brownies to that of hungering and thirsting after
righteousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Properly known as the Weigh Down Workshop, the diet is based on
the premise that overeating and other addictive behaviors stem from
a spiritual void. Only when people turn to God, argue its
proponents, can they experience true fulfilment and overcome their
worldly cravings.
</P>
<P>
   According to its founder, Tennessee dietician Gwen Shamblin, the
key to combating overeating is simple: ``Don't be a slave to food.
Let God fill you up instead. The truth will set you free. Stop that
dialogue with the refrigerator door and start talking to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Eschewing 40-day fasts and religious rules such as not eating
meat on Fridays, her method allows followers to eat what they want,
but only when they are hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of those attending our workshops may have been ritually
sitting on church pews all their lives but at the same time they
were bowing down to food, alcohol or other false comforts. They are
now finding how to truly worship,'' said Mrs. Shamblin.
</P>

   The guru of the Christian slimming program speaks with the
weight of experience. Her own size had yo-yoed for years until, she
says, she stopped studying the content of food and started looking
at people's hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Her diet empire has spawned a Web site _ complete with gift shop
offering self-help tapes, books, and videos featuring slimmed-down
converts.
</P>
<P>
   Large Brits are signing up for the (pounds sterling)60 ($100)
course of 12 introductory sessions, incorporating video and Bible
lessons, in droves. More than 50 groups have been set up here in
the last year.
</P>
<P>
   And, as the members of one group, drawn from the Orpington
Christian Fellowship, testified in an edition of the BBC's
``Everyman'' TV program, ``Slim For Him,'' leaving things up to God
really does seem to work.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Cox, who runs the group in Kent, England, had tried
Weight Watchers, Rosemary Conley and cabbage diets, but nothing
worked until she found motivation with God.
</P>
<P>
   Her clothes size has since fallen from 24 to 18 and she is
determined not to let Him or herself down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suddenly felt so free, it doesn't matter what I eat as long
as I stop when I start feeling full, which is the way the Lord
intended us to eat,'' she said. &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Every Sunday for the past 29 years, a storefront
church in the heart of San Francisco has swayed to the mellifluous
tones and odd rhythms of jazz legend John Coltrane in the name of
divine worship.
</P>
<P>
   The music is not a prop, but the very key to the Almighty. For
this is no ordinary house of God, but the St. John Coltrane African
Orthodox Church, the first place on earth to turn a jazz saxophone
player into an object of religious devotion.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz fans have been quietly coming for years, as have local
aficionados bedazzled by the mystic allure of Coltrane's sleeve
notes for his 1964 album, ``A Love Supreme'' (reproduced right).
</P>
<P>
   Recently, in fact, the church has become something of a minor
San Francisco institution, offering food and clothing to the
homeless as well as a free education in be-bop era jazz.
</P>
<P>
   But that all now looks like it will be coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
   The building containing the church has been sold, the new owner
has more than doubled the rent, and the church fathers have had no
choice but to accept an eviction order that will toss them out by
the middle of March.
</P>
<P>
   Franzo King, the founder of St. John Coltrane and a bishop of
the African Orthodox Church, has warned his parishioners they face
a ``great transition'' and appealed for financial help to find a
new address within the city.
</P>
<P>
   With San Francisco's housing prices rising through the roof
thanks to the economic boom and the internet revolution, though,
Bishop King has few illusions about his chances of finding
anywhere. ``We're pretty much out of here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And so the curtain appears to be closing on an eccentric little
institution whose origins go back to a revelatory night in 1965
when Franzo King, then working as a hairdresser, happened to hear
Coltrane and his quartet at a club in the Western Addition
neighborhood called the Jazz Workshop.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to him that night, he later recounted, was
tantamount to a ``baptism in sound,'' a realization that the music
could help him to see God.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, Coltrane himself had revealed his own spiritual
awakening after years of heroin addiction and ill health. The
sleeve notes to ``A Love Supreme,'' the first in a flurry of
ground-breaking albums recorded in the three years before his
premature death, include a hosannah to the Lord and a poem that
reads much like a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   On this rock of 1960s jazz was the church founded. In its
original form it was called the One Mind Temple Evolutionary
Transitional Church of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the tracks from ``A Love Supreme'' had been incorporated
into its weekly services, complete with gospel chorus backing from
the Sisters of Compassion, led by King's wife Marina.
</P>
<P>
   At first the Kings enjoyed the approval of Coltrane's widow
Alice, but in 1981 she sued them for $7.5 million for desecration
of her late husband's image.
</P>
<P>
   In a peculiar settlement, the Kings allowed themselves to be
taken over by the Chicago-based African Orthodox Church and agreed
to stop treating Coltrane like a God if in exchange they could
proclaim him a saint.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of the one-room church have been adorned with 10-ft.
murals of Coltrane ever since, along with a portrait of a black
Jesus Christ above the altar.
</P>
<P>
   The Lord's Prayer is chanted to Coltrane's ``Spiritual''; ``The
Lord Is My Shepherd'' is sung to the sax line from
``Acknowledgement.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the church did not need to rely on a collection
plate, surviving on private donations, cake sales and a modest
business in T-shirts and postcards. Now, the Kings are lobbying
everyone from Mayor Willie Brown down to save their church.
</P>
<P>
   Once they had ambitions of making ``A Love Supreme'' the U.S.
national anthem. Now just a roof over their heads would do. &QL;

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The warm-up act, those few dozen hardy Albany
people who'd begun the chanting and sign-waving in Academy Park,
had been milling around in the snow and the chill since early
morning _ since the first filmy rays of sunlight had filtered
through the winter clouds canopied over the Albany County
Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Then, about 9:45 Monday morning, the first of the buses from New
York City rolled up to the sidewalk on Washington Avenue, on the
park's west side. The Rev. Al Sharpton's pros came through those
bus doors and got down to business right away. The chant started
the moment they hit the sidewalk: ``No justice, no peace. No
justice, no peace. What do we want? Justice! What do we want?
Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where'd you come in from?'' a big man in a black leather
jacket and knit cap was asked as he moved through the slush toward
the demonstration area that Albany cops had fenced off at the
corner of Eagle and Elk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flatbush,'' he said. ``That's East Flatbush, where all the
best folks live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're here for Amadou?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here for Diablo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Diallo,'' he was told.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we're here for justice. Don't matter what name justice
got.''
</P>
<P>
   As they moved along the freshly shoveled pavement to the
demonstration area in the park's northeastern corner, directly
opposite the courthouse, the signs were unfurled like battle flags.
``Today it's Diallo; Tomorrow It's Me.'' And ``A Badge Does Not
Justify Murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the old courthouse, secure behind its steel barricades
and its ring of Albany cops, Judge Joe Teresi was presiding over
the selection of a jury to decide just what four New York City
police officers were doing not quite a year ago when they pumped 19
bullets into an innocent, unarmed young man named Amadou Diallo.
Was it murder, manslaughter or just a horrible, heart-wrenching
mistake?
</P>
<P>
   That will be up to the jury. The trial is expected to last three
weeks, anyway, possibly a month. The demonstrators plan to be out
in the snow every day with their signs and their distrust.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be a jury to instill much faith in Sharpton's people.
An appeals court decided that a fair jury could not be selected
from 1.1 million mostly minority residents of the Bronx. So now the
jury is being chosen in Albany County, 150 miles north of the Bronx
line, from a population pool of fewer than 300,000 overwhelmingly
white people _ whom the courts view as just naturally fairer,
apparently.
</P>
<P>
   By midday, Sharpton was at the microphone in Academy Park, the
courthouse looming up behind him as the TV cameras whirred. He was
urging several hundred people to stay calm. No violence, he was
saying. We're here because 41 bullets fired at an unarmed man is
violence enough. He was leading the demonstrators in musical
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sing it for Am-a-doo-ou,'' Sharpton sang in a rich, raspy
baritone.
</P>
<P>
   And the chorus rang back, ``A-ay-ay-men. A-ay-ay-men. A-ay-men,
amen, amen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sing it for ju-us-ti-ice,'' Sharpton sang.
</P>
<P>
   ``A-ay-ay-men. A-ay-ay-men. A-ay-men, amen, amen.''
</P>
<P>
   As snowflakes swirled earlier in the day, Alice Green had stood
quietly in the park, taking it all in. A longtime Albany activist
in matters like these, she warmly greeted a smallish, smiling man
in an elegant overcoat. He was Bojana Jordan, born nearly seven
decades ago in Transkei in southern Africa, a former diplomat and
college professor. He carried an ornately carved African walking
stick. Bojana Jordan motioned to the falling snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gods of Africa are crying,'' he told Alice Green. ``They
are looking down on all this, and these are the tears they shed.''
</P>
<P>
   And well might they weep, too. This youthful corpse, this trial
moved so far from home, this chanting, wounded, suspicious crowd in
Academy Park.
</P>
<P>
   Look at it all closely enough, and who wouldn't cry?
</P>

&HT;     TRY THE TROPICAL LOOK TO WARM UP WINTRY ROOMS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is winter and frigid. You have cabin fever and wish you could
get away, but can't.
</P>
<P>
   Don't just sit there daydreaming about warmer climates:
Transform a room in your house where you can retreat to an island
atmosphere and bask in the ambience of an endless vacation.
</P>
<P>
   When trying to create the essence of the tropics, strive for a
mixture that speaks of a summer residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most rooms that have an island look must relate to an
environment in the house,'' said interior designer Carleton Varney,
head of Dorothy Draper &AMP; Co. in New York City. ``It can be off of
the kitchen or garden room. Start with the sunroom if you have one,
or family room, which may be easier to change over than the living
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the space, ``you want to subtly layer the room,
alluding to a hint of the tropics, without screaming it,'' said
interior designer Cecil K. Pollen, owner of Tassels in Lenox, Mass.
``For example, warmth and charm can be achieved with floral print
fabrics or prints with a hint of exotic birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just don't go overboard and be so obvious in what you are
trying to do,'' he warned, especially with snow outside. ``You
won't be fooling anyone, here in the wintry North, like using
mosquito netting or brightly colored tropical birds in the dead of
winter. I normally would go with linen or cotton floral chintz.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember that you have to work with what's outside of your
windows in the neighborhood or countryside, stressed Pollen, who
suggested that adding a couple of miniature potted palm trees (real
or silk) would give the feel of the whispiness of the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a large banana tree in my house,'' said Laura Bohn, an
interior designer in Manhattan. ``You need a southern exposure for
that kind of tree. But it is very tropical-looking and has
extremely large leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have the room or exposure for this kind of tree,
use a palm or banana leaf design in fabric for chair cushions.
</P>
<P>
   Pollen suggested using bamboo pieces with the joints wrapped in
leather. Victorian rattan is too light in weight for the feel of
the tropics, he said. Plantation furnishings in dark mahogany work
well covered in white canvas upholstery and sprinkled with a couple
of floral pillows in linen rather than chintz.
</P>
<P>
   Varney stressed not using too much of any one thing, such as
bamboo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use elements such as an Oriental bamboo sofa or a good folding
wicker chair,'' Varney said. ``There is also a growing family of
pieces of furniture where chair seats and backs are easily
reupholstered.''
</P>
<P>
   He designs island-type fabrics such as a tortoise shell blind on
fabric and a Far Eastern theme combined with Javanese elements.
Oriental pieces work well with everything, he said, particularly
lacquered pieces in russet, blue or jade.
</P>
<P>
   A rattan coffee table with a tray or glass top works well, as
would a large tufted ottoman with a big lacquered tray to serve as
a table top.
</P>
<P>
   Introduce a couple of animal prints, such as leopard, parakeets
or jaguar, and then only on a seat or back cushion of a chair
rather than an upholstered piece, which would be too much. Use
floral prints on the upholstered pieces or occasional pillows.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest and least expensive way to transform walls is to
paint them white. Instead of a blue-white, which looks cold, use a
hint of beige for warmth. Also use tone-on-tone trim.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite colors are chartreuse or any other bright spring
green color,'' Bohn said. ``Pale or sunny yellows are also a good
choice for the Northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   If your budget allows, look to a wallpaper with a trellis
pattern, creating an arbor feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use a trellis wallpaper with a vine or vine with flowers going
through it, depending on the amount of windows and layout of the
room,'' Pollen said. ``If the room has a lot of glass and small
sections of wall space, use a tight trellis without flowers, so
it's not obvious that it's wallpaper, just as if you had a lot of
wall space.''
</P>
<P>
   For the floor, use a bound sisal area rug, rather than
wall-to-wall carpeting. Sisal is versatile, and you don't have to
worry about getting it dirty. At the end of the season, you can
shake the sisal rug out and tuck it away until the following
winter, or leave it out all year, Pollen said.
</P>
<P>
   Lighting can also create a mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a semiformal look, try Chinese bamboo lighting out of
metal,'' Pollen said. ``These come painted in reds and yellows with
brass bells on them. You can hang a bamboo light from the ceiling
to create an outdoor lantern feeling that's associated with the
tropics. These often come with a stretched paper shade. You could
also convert an inexpensive balloon-shaped bird cage into a lamp
for the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Bohn noted that a ceiling fan or light/fan combination is
perfect for a tropical look, especially if the blades are made of
stained wood.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One quick design fix in transforming a room is to simply change
the matting on framed works of art.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of white mats, change to a brighter color in blues,
pinks or greens. You may also want to rotate your works of art and
hang only botanicals this time of year to give the room a warmer
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paintings are wonderful for the feel of the tropics, such as a
Gauguin,'' Pollen said. ``Again, stay away from beach scenes.
Instead, look to people in colorful native clothing. Haiti is known
for primitive paintings.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested using a single large polished conch shell instead
of a collection of seashells. ``In this sense, a decorative item
can work well by itself, rather than overdoing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Varney suggested grouping framed fans on a wall or framing them
under glass.
</P>
<P>
   Plants can be difficult to grow, so try silk instead. Place a
couple of silk orchids around the room or attach one to the base of
a palm tree, for a tropical statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artificial bamboo is made so well that it's hard to tell it
from the real thing,'' Bohn said.
</P>
<P>
   Boxes of straw or highly lacquered wood make excellent plant
holders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can also use these for magazines, if you choose not to use
plants,'' Varney said. ``They also work well empty, if you group
them in an interesting way.''
</P>
<P>
   As a finishing touch, Bohn said, put out a big bowl of fresh
fruit, including coconuts, mangoes, limes and bananas, or a basket
of fragrant citrus potpourri or an island floral scent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fragrance also adds a lot to the mood of the room,'' Bohn
said. ``And there is nothing as fresh and wonderful as the smell of
citrus.''

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Nicole Surething went on a diet and almost died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started in eighth grade. I wanted to lose 10 pounds. I
thought I was chubby. It just snowballed from there,'' said
Surething, who is now 21 and a senior at the College of Saint Rose
in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   In a few months, as friends complimented her weight loss,
Surething dropped to 75 pounds on her 5-foot-4-inch frame. ``I
would wake up before my family and then pour cereal and milk down
the drain so they'd think I was eating something. At lunch, I'd
take a few bites of apple and yogurt and then throw it away,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner became a matter of pushing food around her plate, cutting
it up into small pieces and trying to fool her parents.
</P>
<P>
   Surething was later diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, one of
several eating disorders, including bulimia and binge eating, that
affect more than 5 million Americans, many of them young women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a wicked distorted body image,'' Surething said. ``I
used to measure myself constantly and look in the mirror. I'd weigh
myself five times a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, after years of therapy and a 30-day stay in the hospital,
Surething is healthy and eating again.
</P>
<P>
   Experts caution that eating disorders are more pervasive than
ever, especially among young children, ages 9 to 12, who in the
past weren't considered at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finding that it's difficult to find therapists and
doctors who are knowledgeable about eating disorders,'' said Monna
Bender, a certified social worker and president of the Capital
Region Association for Eating Disorders, an Albany-based volunteer
group dedicated to raising awareness about eating problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a young girl taken to a pediatrician who just told her
to go home and eat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Treating eating disorders, especially anorexia nervosa, is never
so simple, according to Dr. Sharon Alger-Mayer, an associate
professor of medicine at Albany Medical Center. ``Anorexia is
challenging,'' she said. ``It's one of the psychiatric disorders
with the highest mortality rates.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 6 percent of those with serious cases die, often
from cardiac problems related to severe starvation. And only 50
percent of diagnosed cases report a cure, according to Lynn
Edgerly, a social worker at Four Winds Psychiatric Hospital in
Saratoga Springs, where she works with people on an out-patient
basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will struggle with it for years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such grim statistics, scientists are making some
progress in understanding and treating the disorder with new
research on brain chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're finding is that the same substances that control
emotion and mood control appetite,'' Alger-Mayer said. One of the
most commonly prescribed anti-depressant medications, Prozac, is
now also approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat
bulimia, an eating disorder characterized by overeating and
purging, usually through vomiting or abusing laxatives.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the current research, however, is focusing on the role
of neuropeptides, or specialized brain chemicals, on appetite and
cravings. Such research may open the door to new treatments for
anorexia nervosa and obesity, Alger-Mayer said.
</P>
<P>
   But even the best treatments don't work unless the eating
disorders are identified early. That's the goal of a national
outreach program slated to take place in February, with more than
1,000 high schools, colleges and community locations offering free,
anonymous screenings for eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Besides getting information on the problems, those identified as
being at risk will be referred to appropriate counseling service.
Those interested in finding a nearby site can call 800-405-9100.
</P>
<P>
   As with other addictions, scientists aren't really sure what
causes eating disorders, although there is some research showing
there may be a genetic component making some people more likely to
have problems than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tends to occur more in families with a history of anxiety,
depression and mood disorders,'' said Alger-Mayer. ``With both
anorexics and bulimics, therapy is key.''
</P>
<P>
   Surething credits both therapy and hospitalization before her
sophomore year in high school for helping to turn her condition
around. ``They wouldn't let me leave until I reached 96 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, she can't believe how sick she was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have photos of myself from then,'' she said. ``I keep them
in my photo album to remind myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Surething now talks to college and high school students to warn
them about the dangers of eating disorders. ``I really want to work
toward solving the problem. So many people are struggling.''

IS THIS TV'S FINAL ANSWER?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By MARLA MATZER ROSE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe every decade gets the TV catch phrase it deserves. In the
'60s, ``Laugh-In'' spawned ``Sock it to me!'' In the '70s there was
``Dyn-o-mite!'' (J.J. on ``Good Times''). The early 1990s brought
Bart Simpson sassing, ``Eat my shorts!'' Now, the first catch
phrase of the millennium is gripping the nation: ``Is that your
final answer?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' is the game show that revived
the genre and gave birth to the ``final answer.'' In the process of
becoming a huge ratings winner for ABC, it's also become one of the
few shows that is widely enough watched to produce such a pop
culture saying in these days of cable TV and the ``splintered''
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe part of the phrase's appeal is its no-nonsense attitude.
Just as we delight in listening to others get pinned to the wall by
such tough-talking media hosts as Dr. Laura Schlessinger and Judge
Judy, we revel in the bottom-line absolutism of the final answer.
``Is that your final answer?'' we ask our loved one as she wavers
between chunky and plain in the peanut butter section of the
supermarket. ``Final answer?'' we bark at our kid as he reaches for
a better excuse for not having cleaned his room or done his
homework.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the deal, though ... the phrase isn't even American. It's
British. ``It originated in the U.K.; we bought the entire concept
from the U.K. version (which debuted in 1998),'' explained Patrick
Preblick, a spokesman for the ABC show. Preblick added that host
Regis Philbin must establish ``for legal reasons'' with contestants
that an answer is, indeed, their final answer.
</P>
<P>
   What? So America's newest catch phrase is actually just imported
legalese? Heck, it's not even an exclamation, like so many of the
great TV sayings of decades past _ it's a question. A wimpy British
question, at that.
</P>
<P>
   Has it come to this? Is that our final answer?

High in Valencia, Calif., is working out at the Spectrum Club in
hopes of making the football team next fall. credit: Andy

<TEXT>
<P>
   Nicholas Murillo's brow furrows in concentration, his biceps
taut as he lifts weights at the Spectrum Club in Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   In the bright gym around him, dozens of middle-age corporate
executives are fighting the battle of the bulge on stair machines
and exercise bikes. But a fortysomething pot belly is not a concern
for Nicholas, at least not for another three decades or so.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-year-old Valencia seventh-grader is more concerned about
bulking up enough to impress the coaches who will pick the
eighth-grade football squad at La Mesa Junior High School next
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the next generation of fitness club denizens _ fresh-faced
youths who aren't waiting until they're eligible for a corporate
discount to workout at fitness centers. But whether they are
rushing things remains a question.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room from Nicholas on a rainy Tuesday afternoon,
Ashley Stephens, 14, of Saugus, works up a sweat on an exercise
bike, building endurance for dance classes and hoping to ``get a
little thinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen-year-old soccer goalie Ashley Breakfield, a senior at
Valencia High School, is starting her second year of intense
training at Spectrum with a personal trainer _ an effort she hopes
will pay off with an invitation to Olympic training camp or, at
least, a college soccer scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Worth, 14, of Valencia said he works out at Spectrum to
get an edge on the baseball field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get an advantage,'' said Daniel, a shortstop on
the Valencia Titans baseball team. ``We have a weight room at
school, but this is a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Teens are still a rarity in most health clubs, but Spectrum's
Teen Fit program has been a hit _ especially in suburban Valencia
where 211 teens signed up. A teen membership costs $95 in
initiation and amenities fees and $25 a month, compared to $240 and
$58 a month for adults. Teens are only allowed in the gym during
off-peak hours.
</P>
<P>
   Spectrum's teen program and the trend of wealthy parents hiring
personal trainers to work out with their children has sparked
debate in the medical community. Critics say gym memberships force
an adult fitness regimen on teens, depriving them of the sheer fun
of athletics. There's also a concern that still-developing muscles
and bones might be damaged by repetitive activities such as lifting
weights.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John DiFiori, a professor of sports medicine at the
University of California, Los Angeles, said that children are more
likely to develop overuse injuries in structured training programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two ways of looking at it,'' DiFiori said. ``If you
roll a basketball down a driveway and let a kid shoot baskets,
they're not very likely to have an overuse injury develop. If you
put a child in a situation where they are being asked to achieve a
certain level of intensity of activity and they're trying to reach
that goal, that is a setting where overuse injuries can occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Teens like Nicholas are just hitting their maximum growth spurt,
which some research shows can make a body more susceptible to
injury. Take gymnasts. DiFiori said there is compelling evidence
that stress on the growth plates in young gymnasts' wrists may
interfere with development of the wrist joint.
</P>
<P>
   Spectrum trainers are told to keep an eye on teen members. They
know the kids will try to push it _ either because of unsupervised
weight training at school or peer pressure to max out weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think if they can do two exercises, 10 is even better,''
said John Farr, a certified personal trainer. ``I tell them, `Less
is more, less is more.' I teach them that they have to give
themselves time to recover or they're just working against
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The trainers say they are careful not to push teen clients too
hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it depends on age,'' Farr said. ``The younger the
person, the easier you have to go on them. Their joints are still
growing. Their bodies are still growing. You cannot push them as
hard as you can an adult. You could seriously damage someone, and
that could be with them the rest of their lives. And, also, kids
want to have fun. It's supposed to be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in an increasingly sedentary age where kids are as likely
to play baseball on Nintendo as they are in a sandlot, it's hard to
knock regular exercise. DiFiori said teens could benefit from
workouts in a well-maintained, closely supervised gym as long as
the equipment can be adjusted to fit their smaller frames.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they enjoy going to a gym with their friends and riding the
exercise bike and shooting some baskets or lifting weights in a
supervised environment, that's just a new setting for kids to
interact and be active,'' he said. ``That's great.''
</P>
<P>
   The teens are glad to get access to top-notch equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot better than school,'' Nicholas said. ``I don't
think I'd do it if I couldn't come here.'' &QL;

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Monday a week ago was a typical day in the
life of 18-year-old Alex Grodd. Or what passes for a life these
days for Grodd and scores more like him in the waning hours of this
state's high-stakes presidential showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Grodd, the youngest staffer on Bill Bradley's New Hampshire
team, had stayed at his desk until 3:30 a.m., then was back up
before &UR;  &LR; 8 a.m. to stand outside in the frigid air and wave Bradley
signs at morning commuters _ ``doing visibility,'' in campaign
parlance _ before Monday's regular duties began. Six hours and many
e-mails and phone calls later, Grodd decided he needed more fresh
air. With a stack of fliers tucked under one arm, he drove off on
an impromptu ``lit drop'' in north Manchester, shadowed by two
reporters. While the reporters swapped media gossip, Grodd tried to
chat them up about Bradley's health-care plan.
</P>
<P>
   Knocking on one door, Grodd seemed startled when it opened. He
handed the owner a pamphlet. ``You're wasting your time,'' the man
growled, and Grodd winced, turning to leave. ``I'm already voting
for the guy,'' the man said. Grodd pivoted and gave a ringing
thumbs-up. ``Excellent!'' he chirped.
</P>
<P>
   By 7 p.m., a groggy Grodd was in a downtown law office, coaching
college volunteers on how to cold-call potential supporters. From 9
until midnight, with only a brief pizza break, he nailed down
details for a late-night airport reception for the candidate, who
was jetting in from Iowa. Bradley finally landed at 3:30 a.m., to
much staff-orchestrated hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly 5 o'clock Tuesday morning before Grodd crawled
into bed, a mattress on the kitchen floor of a $750-a-month,
two-bedroom apartment he shares with three other staffers. Less
than four hours later, rising from a tangle of dirty laundry and
twisted bedsheets, Grodd got ready to do it all again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most intense, competitive thing I've ever done,''
said Grodd, a onetime high school tennis star at Longmeadow who
postponed his freshman year at Harvard to enlist in the Bradley
brigade. ``And I wouldn't trade it for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens to Bradley in the primary, Bradley's fate and
that of other presidential hopefuls rested at least in part on the
shoulders of young believers like Grodd, who journeyed to New
Hampshire last summer and never left.
</P>
<P>
   They are the shock troops of Campaign 2000, the dewy-eyed
idealists hoping to send an earthquake through the party
establishments. Almost by default, they stand in line to become the
next generation of political operatives in an era when political
operative is about as revered a title as special prosecutor, and
MTV heavily outpolls the DNC or GOP.
</P>
<P>
   In elections past, their forebears stumped the state for
Kefauver and Lodge, McCarthy and McGovern, Tsongas and Reagan.
These days the ground troops do not just stump, they beep: Cell
phones and laptops have become as prevalent as voter lists and
hand-lettered signage. Yet the fervor they display is almost
quaintly old-fashioned. If the New Hampshire primary is truly about
retail politics, then these are the fresh-faced sales trainees
earnestly practicing the art of the deal. Customer service with a
smile and a pile of position papers.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Welcome to Wal-Mart. Can I show you something in a
pro-choice centrist who's big on campaign finance reform?(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran the campaign up here this summer on the backs of 15
interns,'' says Mark Longabaugh, Bradley's New Hampshire campaign
director who at age 29 ran Richard Gephardt's 1988 presidential
campaign up here. ``Fifteen interns taking on a sitting vice
president and the Democratic party power structure. It doesn't get
any better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Grodd and his three roommates _ Steven Wachtel, 26; Brian
Selander, 23; and Matt Rodriguez, 27 _ it doesn't get any more
taxing than this, either _ physically, financially, or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   All four were members of Bradley's original gang of 15. Each
started out as a volunteer, going on the payroll later as Bradley's
momentum and cash-flow picked up. Selander and Rodriguez were the
first full-timers brought aboard. Grodd signed on for the duration
in August, when Harvard needed to know if he'd be enrolling for the
1999-2000 school year.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four, Wachtel earns the most _ a $1,089 paycheck every
two weeks _ and Grodd the least, $1,000 a month. Figuring
16-to-20-hour workdays and seven-day workweeks multiplied by five
months, that works out to an average of about $2.15 an hour, plus
mileage. That and all the free peanut butter sandwiches they can
eat.
</P>
<P>
   This is retail politics at factory wages, conducted in a
frathouse setting. Last weekend, six stray campaign workers were
sleeping, if the word even applies, on the apartment floor.
Competition for the morning shower is not a pretty sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real adults cannot afford to do this,'' says Longabaugh,
betraying just a smidgen of nostalgia. ``It is not a very stable
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Stable, no. Sacrificial, yes. Grodd is forgoing up to a year of
college to work for Bradley, but at least is promised a place at
Harvard next fall. Wachtel and Selander both have out-of-state
girlfriends who are alternately patient and perplexed by the
demands of the campaign, the two staffers say. Rodriguez tries to
keep up with friends by phone but was surprised by the recent news
that a close pal was not only expecting a baby, the baby had
already arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, oh my God, I didn't even know his wife was
pregnant,'' says Rodriguez. ``The past nine months are a blur. Then
again, I've only had seven days off since the first of May.''
</P>
<P>
   An avid hockey player, Wachtel complains that the steady
junk-food diet and lack of exercise have left him in the worst
shape of his life. ``I've been tempted to have a T-shirt made that
says, `I gained 15 pounds for Bill Bradley!' '' he jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel, who hails from Long Island, is an old hand compared to
Grodd and some of the other staffers and college-age volunteers. A
graduate of the State University of New York at Binghamton, he was
a student volunteer for Clinton-Gore in 1992 and spent a year at
Brooklyn Law School before volunteering in Bradley's New Jersey
campaign headquarters. In Manchester, he's been recruiting student
volunteers in other states, notably New York and Pennsylvania. One
ex-canvasser he spoke with spun tales of going door-to-door for
Harry Truman a half-century ago. Moments like that, and getting to
see all the candidates and campaigns up close, are what make the
long hours worthwhile, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not like having a normal life,'' reflects Wachtel.
``Your bills don't get paid. You don't talk to your girlfriend,
except on the phone. People on the outside think this is glamorous
work, but making 250 phone calls a day is not glamorous. It's more
like telemarketing.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens after today is the great unspoken (mostly)
question. Like his roommies, Wachtel says he hasn't given the
immediate future much thought. Most likely he'll be reassigned to
another state campaign office as Bradley continues his quest.
Worst-case scenario, says Wachtel, would be catching up on a lot of
missed sleep and contemplating a return to law school.
</P>
<P>
   Selander, a campaign field coordinator, arrived in New Hampshire
last May, when Bradley was still polling in single digits. Selander
made no calculation at that time that joining the campaign would
lead to a brighter future, he says, or even to a salaried job.
Nevertheless, he counted himself a true believer, having driven
Bradley around the state in 1998, laying the groundwork for
Campaign 2000. A New Jersey native, Selander had been a high school
journalist, a legislative press secretary at 18, and an acting
chief of staff at 20. At Rutgers, where he ran Students for
Clinton-Gore in '96, there was a small group of political junkies,
Selander recalls, and a huge group that wanted nothing whatsoever
to do with politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my college friends were rabid Republicans, but at
least we shared a passion for government,'' says Selander. ``Most
of my friends roll their eyes at the thought of political work, but
what scares me is losing a whole generation of voters to that kind
of apathy.''

GEORGIA'S STILL ON HIS MIND 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Picked-up pieces while wondering precisely how many
snowflakes it takes to cancel school in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   --We can argue the merits of the 60 minutes of football that
transpired Sunday night. Certainly there was some sloppy play, bad
field goal kicking, and zero first-half touchdowns. But for
exciting finishes, this one beats 'em all. Tennessee rallied from a
16-0 deficit and tied the game with 2:12 left. Then came a 73-yard
TD pass play. Finally, there was the Titans' furious rally, which
ended 1 yard short as the clock reached 0:00. That beats Scott
Norwood kicking wide right in my book. Joe Montana's 92-yard drive
to beat the Bengals in 1989 was pretty good, as was the Steelers'
21-17 win over the Cowboys in Super Bowl X. Joe Namath making good
on his guarantee and shocking the world remains the event's
signature game, but this was the best finish.
</P>
<P>
   --Kurt Warner got the MVP, the full-page milk ad, and all the
ink, but St. Louis should commission a statue for veteran
linebacker Mike Jones, who made the game-ending tackle.
</P>
<P>
   --Rams owner Georgia Frontiere has been married seven times.
This will be her eighth ring.
</P>
<P>
   --A Super Bowl ring is better than currency. Some ring-winners
carry 'em around in small cloth pouches, then use them to get
special attention from bell captains, maitre d's, parking lot
attendants, and airline personnel. How come a baseball writer's
card doesn't work like that?
</P>
<P>
   --Steve McNair's turf toe looked pretty good to me.
</P>
<P>
   --A lot of football folks think the 16th pick in the country was
too high a price to pay for Bill Belichick. The Patriots have to
hope the Jets don't come up with Jevon Kearse, picked at 16 last
year. Kearse may have been a victim of the Sports Illustrated cover
jinx. He had zero sacks, got tagged with a costly 15-yard facemask
penalty, and was a nanosecond late getting to Warner on the 73-yard
TD toss. But he's the biggest thing to happen to Fort Myers since
Thomas Edison. Wonder if he's ever been to City of Palms Park.
</P>
<P>
   --Robert Redford plays the lead in ``The Dick Vermeil Story.''
</P>
<P>
   --Tina Turner brought some heat to the pregame show, but ``Proud
Mary'' is just not the same without Ike and the Ikettes.
</P>
<P>
   --Ex-Patriots Ray Agnew and Todd Collins get Super Bowl rings
with the Rams. And did you know that Ty Law is Tony Dorsett's
nephew? That would make Law and Anthony Dorsett first cousins.
</P>
<P>
   --You never know when you may be in the presence of kings.
Atlanta's downtown Hyatt served as media headquarters for the week.
On Saturday night, the media lounge featured a telecast of the Mike
Tyson fight from England, and scores of reporters gathered around
the tube for the free show. There was a burst of applause from the
typically cynical scribes when Muhammad Ali made a surprise
appearance to watch the fight. Even more shocking, a New York Post
reporter offered his seat to the champ. Ali watched only one round.
</P>
<P>
   --Elton John performed for two hours at the Fox Theater Saturday
night and dedicated ``Tiny Dancer'' to Ali, who was in attendance.
Sir Elton also played ``Philadelphia Freedom'' for Billie Jean
King.
</P>
<P>
   --Whom do you like: Eddie George or Harold Shaw?
</P>
<P>
   --Did leather pants ever go out of style? They were everywhere
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   --Stan Kasten, who runs the Braves and the Hawks for Ted Turner,
gets high marks for refusing to seat Spike Lee in the front row for
the Hawks' home game with the Knicks Friday night. Spike settled
for Row 2.
</P>
<P>
   --No John Rocker sightings, but his aunt wrote a swell editorial
in the local paper, explaining that the Rocker family is not
racist.
</P>
<P>
   --Doug Flutie was at the game and plans to go to Hawaii next
week. Barely recognizable under a white ballcap, he flew home to
Boston early Monday. Seeing Doug by himself in the back of a
crowded aircraft, it was hard not to wonder whether things might
have been different had Wade Phillips done the right thing and let
Flutie play against the Titans in the wild card game.
</P>
<P>
   --People give you dirty looks if you walk down Peachtree Street
holding a can of Pepsi. But why did Coke folk choose Super Bowl
week to announce a massive layoff?
</P>
<P>
   --Depressing airport sign greeting weary passengers trying to
escape from Atlanta Monday: ``It's been fun! See you at the Major
League Baseball All-Star Game here in Atlanta in July.'' Hope
everybody has their electricity restored by then.

 MANCHESTER, N.H.: ... of apathy.''

<P>
   Selander's sole trip home since August was to help his father,
whose New Jersey home was destroyed by Hurricane Floyd. After
several frantic calls, Selander learned that his father had been
rescued by boat from the roof of the house. Selander says it was
the only time in the past year that the campaign was not uppermost
in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, the grizzled vet of the four, graduated from Holy
Cross in 1994. After teaching for three years at Nativity Prep in
Roxbury, he joined Gephardt's Washington, D.C., staff and later
aided Governor Jeanne Shaheen's 1998 New Hampshire campaign. He and
Selander were the first two Bradley paratroopers to land in the
Granite State last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Iditarod of politics on any presidential
campaign,'' says Rodriguez. ``I was determined not to take this job
as a springboard to something else. I wanted to enjoy it for what
it was, which I have. Win or lose, I know we've done everything we
can.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Grodd, who graduated from intern to Manchester
field organizer in a few short weeks. The oldest of three children
_ his father is a roofing contractor, his mother the director of
the Jewish Endowment Foundation of Western Massachusetts _ Grodd
grew up in a household where sports was far more popular than
partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   Grodd got interested in Bradley after watching him on ``Meet The
Press'' last winter, he says. Peggy Grodd says her biggest surprise
was that her oldest child didn't go to work for one of the
Republican candidates, since he had once subscribed to Rush
Limbaugh's newsletter. Both say the decision to delay college was a
thorny issue in the Grodd household.
</P>
<P>
   ``I floated it to my parents, but they were not too thrilled,''
confesses Grodd. ``The more I talked to voters and got to hang
around Bradley personally, though, the more I knew I wasn't coming
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Grodd, 44, says her son's willingness to get involved in
the political process has stirred up feelings of guilt over not
having done more herself. She's been driving up on weekends to work
as a campaign volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex was right on this treadmill to Harvard when he wanted to
veer off, and I thought, oh my gosh,'' Peggy Grodd reflects. ``But
by August, I knew he could learn more up there than he could at
college. He's got a work ethic I don't see in a lot of his peers.
Last year Alex was real disorganized, which was part of his charm.
Now he's got a to-do list on his desk. If he forgets something, he
realizes it impacts more than just himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, she says with a laugh, ``I love it that he's still enough
of a kid to call home when something goes wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, Riverwalk Mills looks like the aging
Manchester textile plant it is. Inside, in a suite of rooms that
serves as Bradley headquarters, it looks more like an elementary
school built on the cheap in the late 1950s. The wooden floors are
stained and scuffed, the walls are mostly whitewashed plywood, the
overhead lights institutional fluorescent, and a brisk January wind
blows through cracks in the window casings. Electrical cords
crisscross the wallboards, connected to hard drives or _ even more
prized by staffers _ space heaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody know Bradley's position on home schooling?'' a young
intern calls out, covering the phone and looking hopefully around
the room.
</P>
<P>
   From his corner desk, Grodd shouts back something
unintelligible. A swivel-legs Elvis clock counts off the final
minutes and hours of the campaign on the wall above Grodd's desk.
Yellow Post-It notes occupy the perimeter of his computer screen _
a nice low-tech touch. Grodd gets up to deal with a balky printer,
and his cell phone starts ringing in his pocket. He whips out the
phone and starts talking. The conversation has a strange echo to
it, perhaps because Selander, the party on the other of the phone,
is sitting no more than 10 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not out at a lit drop,'' barks Grodd. ``I'm standing
in front of my desk.'' He stares over at Selander. ``This is the
most ridiculous conversation I've had all day,'' he mutters, and
shuts the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Selander walks across the hall to confer with Holly Teliska, a
student volunteer helping to coordinate New Hampshire campus groups
for Bradley. ``I'm a college student, too, so I know what it takes
to get them to come out,'' Teliska, 19, tells a reporter. ``Free
pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   Teliska, a Colgate sophomore and political science major, is
skipping two weeks of classes to see the primary campaign through
to the end. ``This is the best experience ever,'' she gushes.
``We're here until midnight every night. You get to know people
really well. I'm in a Bradley bubble here. At college, you're in a
different sort of bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   Grodd, whom MTV followed around recently for an upcoming story
on life in the Campaign 2000 trenches, says he hopes the Bradley
bubble never bursts. ``I don't even think about losing,'' he says,
pulling out his cell phone and punching in another series of
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers being mothers, Peggy Grodd tries to keep everything in
perspective. ``I don't know if Alex has the maturity to accept a
loss, or at least not take it personally,'' she says. ``But so far
his instincts have been pretty good.''

SWEET VALENTINE TREATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Love is in the air. Valentine's Day is near.
</P>
<P>
   The big day falls on a weekday this year, but that hasn't
stopped resorts and hotels across the land from coming up with
simple to ultimate ways to say, ``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   There really is no need to spend a fortune, but if you insist on
being, lavish, heare are some ideas:
</P>
<P>
   The Engaging Weekend at the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel offers
couples not just a suite and champagne, but amenities that were
highlighted in Boston magazine's Best of Boston issue like dinner
in the hotel's Oak Room (named the best steakhouse), cocktails in
the Oak Bar (most romantic bar), a diamond, chocolates and flowers,
and spa treatments from Boston's best. The package is just $9,995
and that includes a $7,500 credit at Shreve, Crump &AMP; Low, and
$1,000 at Neiman Marcus (best lingerie). Not quite right? Then for
$12,750, try the Shreve, Crump &AMP; Low Engaging Martini, served with
quite a rock _ a one- carat Master Cut Diamond Ring. The hotel has
less costly packages, including a weekend rate of $149 through Feb.
28. Call 617-267-5300.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearts and Flowers'' is the offering from the Four Seasons
Resort Palm Beach where for a mere $25,000 a flower-filled suite
waits, and at a private pre-opening Breakfast at Tiffany's, there's
a diamond ring tucked amid the waffles. There's more, and there's
also less costly romance weekends at this oceanfront resort
starting at $420. Call 800-432-2335.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Regent Wall Street will set aside its historic
Grand Ballroom (half the size of Grand Central Station) for just
one couple, accompanied by a seven-course dinner and a live string
quartet.
</P>
<P>
   The $5,000 ticket includes a loft suite, breakfast in bed and
all taxes and service. Call 212-699-5605.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, the Westin Nova Scotian in Halifax (twice named to
Conde Naste's Best Places to Stay in the Whole World) offers a Feb.
11-14 one-night package for $140 that includes room, dinner, and
wine (902-421-1000).
</P>
<P>
   The Queen Elizabeth in Montreal offers a $199 Valentine Weekend
that includes a night's accommodation and dinner for two in The
Beaver Club, one of Canada's finest restaurants. Guests taking the
Feb. 12 package also have a chance to win a stay in the Royal
Suite. Call 514-861-3511.
</P>
<P>
   Most weekend packages include breakfast, but if you're looking
for the ultimate breakfast in bed, call the Seaport Hotel in Boston
(877-SEAPORT or 617-385-4000), which on Feb. 12 is introducing the
Ultimate Bed and Breakfast package. It includes that delicious meal
along with a keepsake copy of ``Breakfast in Bed: 90 Recipes for
Creative Indulgences'' by Jesse Ziff Cool of Flea St. Caf in Menlo
Park, Calif., who writes that breakfast in bed is for a sweetheart
who needs to feel your love in a new way, a spouse who needs
strength to face a tough day, a sick child who needs a little extra
TLC . . .'' Preparation time for these special breakfasts range
from 5 to less than 30 minutes. The package is $279 a night. From
Feb. 11-14, the hotel is featuring a special menu.
</P>
<P>
   Good deals on overnight stays can be found just about
everywhere. In Philadelphia, there's a Leap Into Love Valentine's
package starting at $97 a night including a Culture Pass to area
museums, parking, breakfast, and other discounts. For details, call
888-450-3224 or visit www.gophila.com.
</P>
<P>
   And in San Francisco you can leave your heart, not your wallet
until Feb. 29 (it's Leap Year) for $89-$129 at hotels such as the
Maxwell, Bedford, or Rex. Call 800-677-1509.
</P>
<P>
   America's Home Town, Plymouth, is also home to one of the
country's great love stories. In Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem,
``The Courtship of Myles Standish,'' he tells how Standish sent
John Alden to court Priscilla (described as the loveliest maiden of
Plymouth) for him, only John and Priscilla (who said, ``Speak for
yourself John'') fell in love and married in 1622. From the
couples' eight children and 68 grandchildren, there are now more
than a million descendants, including Longfellow.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 12, Charles Coombs, director of the Alden House, will
talk on ``The Myth vs. The Reality of the Story of John and
Priscilla Alden'' at 2:30 p.m. at the John Carver Inn. If you'd
like to make a weekend of it, the inn has a two-night package at
$119 in a four-poster suite or a $179 package in a two-room,
fireplaced suite (call 800-274-1620); the Pilgrim Sands Motel, on
the ocean, has a $159 package (800-729-SANDS); and the Governor
Bradford offers a one-night $75 package (call 800-332-1620). All
the packages include dinner or dinner vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Now if you have John or Priscilla in your name, the Plymouth
County Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau is looking for your love story
in 150 words. The winning entry will receive a lavish weekend in
Plymouth Nov. 17-19. Entries must be in by Feb. 14. For complete

Rustic getaway &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A cabin in the woods sounds very romantic, but are you up to it?
Gunstock ski area in Gilford, N.H., has opened its camping cabins
to winter visitors. The cabins are just $50 a night midweek and $55
on weekends. ``Rustic is the best way to describe them,'' said
Sylvia Leggett of Gunstock. ``They are warm and cozy with their
solid wood walls, but they have no running water, the bathroom and
shower facilites are a fair walk from the cabins, and you can't
park any closer than 50 yards away.'' Leggett adds that having
amenities at a distance adds a sense of adventure, as does waking
up to an untracked blanket of snow at one's door. Visitors have to
supply their own sleeping bags and camping gear, but they also
receive a free cross-country trail pass and discounts on alpine
skiing and snowboarding. Want to know more? Call 800-GUNSTOCK, ext.

IT WAS A SUPERIOR BOWL IN ALL RESPECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Of course, it only made sense that two teams who
flouted form charts and sabotaged logic to get here should stage a
Super Bowl that defied earthly analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Rams are a devout bunch, studying their prayer
books as zealously as their playbooks. And after they beat the
Tennessee Titans by a yard, 23-16, Sunday night at the Georgia
Dome, they were invoking the deity all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Isaac Bruce, whose 73-yard catch-and-run with a
Kurt Warner bomb put the Rams ahead to stay with 1:54 left _
moments after the Titans had obliterated a 16-point deficit _ made
it seem as if he was an innocent bystander on the decisive play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't me,'' said Bruce. ``That was all God.''
</P>
<P>
   Even commissioner Paul Tagliabue, perhaps relieved that for one
of the few times in its 34-year history, the NFL's showcase game
was a melodramatic contest instead of an anticlimactic coronation,
felt more indebted to higher forces than the sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' he said Monday morning, ``a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this thrill-upon-thrill scenario may have strained even
the credulity of divine inspiration. Rams running back Marshall
Faulk truly captured the surrealism ofthe events when he conceded,
``Oh my! This is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   There. That explains it.
</P>
<P>
   Consider how improbable it was that these two teams even got
this far _ the Titans for the first time in their 40-year history,
since they helped give birth to the American Football League in
1960; the Rams for the first time since they moved from Los Angeles
in 1995. Remember how they entered the season as certified
also-rans: The Titans were considered monuments of mediocrity after
three straight 8-8 finishes, and the Rams could only aspire to such
heights after going 5-11 and 4-12 in the second installment of Dick
Vermeil's coaching career.
</P>
<P>
   Then factor in that each team went 13-3 and survived stern tests
in their conference playoffs and you have the makings of . . .
what?
</P>
<P>
   A classic, as it turned out. But for 37 minutes, this was
shaping up as one of the duller Super Bowls, which is an
achievement, considering the history of this bloated extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   Utilizing their panoply of offensive weapons _ especially the
arm of regular-season and Super Bowl MVP Kurt Warner _ the Rams had
driven the Titans everywhere but home to Nashville. Though they
converted only one of their six consecutive visits inside the
Titans 20 into a touchdown (a 9-yard toss from Warner to Torry
Holt, who set rookie records with 7 catches and 109 yards) and had
been limited to three Jeff Wilkins chip shots (27-, 29-, and
28-yard field goals) on their first five, the Rams had the noose
around the Titans, 16-0, midway through the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That may hardly seem an insurmountable obstacle with some 23
minutes left, but the Titans' offense is more a drone than an
explosion on its best days. And until it apparently fell hopelessly
behind, it hadn't even been a whimper Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But just when TV sets across America started turning to the
``Murder, She Wrote'' marathon, Tennessee began going for the kill.
Erratic, exciting quarterback Steve McNair did what he does best:
turned the game into street ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like a peewee game,'' said Rams linebacker Todd
Collins, the Patriots escapee. ``It looked like we were completely
exhausted and he was the big kid running around.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the ever-mobile McNair was throwing (22 for 36, 214
yards), scrambling (8 carries, 64 yards, a Super Bowl record for a
quarterback), and having a grand old time. And running back Eddie
George (28 carries, 95 yards, TDs of 1 yard and 2 yards) played the
role of the hammer on two grinding TD drives. Finally, Al Del
Greco's 43-yard field goal with 2:12 left capped the greatest
comeback ever in a Super Bowl, making it 16-16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennessee was so physical with its front seven on offense and
defense,'' said Vermeil. ``We've become such a finesse team, we
lost some toughness.''
</P>
<P>
   But not their composure. As soon as Warner (24 for 45, a Super
Bowl-record 414 yards, 2 TDs) got the ball back, he immediately
reached for the dagger. His right sideline strike to Bruce (6
receptions, 162 yards) started descending just in front of the
receiver, who adjusted his route, left overmatched cornerback
Denard Walker in his wake, and came back to spear the ball at the
Titan 40. Then he exploited the inexperience of free safety Anthony
Dorsett, who drew the start because veteran Marcus Robertson had
broken a leg last week. Dorsett's support of Walker was too
vigorous as he overran the play, and Bruce took note, cut inside,
``and after that, it was just a race to the end zone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He won it easily, but the Rams didn't. They had to withstand one
last dizzying assault by McNair. Taking over at his 12 with 1:48
left, he got the Titans within sniffing distance of a tie at the
St. Louis 10 with six seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   On the final play, tight end Frank Wycheck and wide receiver
Kevin Dyson _ the authors of the last-second lateral and kickoff
return for a touchdown that had benumbed Buffalo in the AFC
wild-card round three weeks ago _ set up for another miracle. Both
took off from the right, with Wycheck winding up in the end zone
but covered, and Dyson at about the 5 but seemingly free.
</P>
<P>
   The play had been designed for Dyson, and McNair drilled the
ball to him. But linebacker Mike Jones made an adjustment that
proved fatal to the Titans. He peeled away from Wycheck, then
lassoed Dyson by the legs, and the wide receiver's lunge for the
end zone was 1 agonizing yard short as time and the Titans expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was without a doubt the biggest tackle I ever made,'' said
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is whether it signals a dynasty or an
aberration.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil believes the Rams are in a position to do more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no guarantees to anything,'' he said. ``But with the
kind of guys these people are, with the leadership of Kurt and the
other leaders on this team under contract, and us being in good
shape with the salary cap, I think we can stay together.''
</P>
<P>
   They may not be alone. Needless to say, every hero requires a
gallant foil, and the Titans were just that. On Sunday, they proved
they're far above average, and now there's just one rung left.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what is going to start us up again next year,'' said
Tennessee offensive tackle Brad Hopkins. ``We want to get back to
where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe it. Believe anything after this epic.

 UNDATED: more persuasive.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Kivelson stood by her statement.
``Nobody I've talked to has come up with a challenge to this
interpretation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kivelson said that if the full Galileo mission extension was
approved, the magnetometer would be looking to see whether this
same type of phenomenon occurred on Ganymede, which is the largest
moon in the solar system and is even larger than the planet
Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the spacecraft discovered that Ganymede has its own
strong magnetic field, indicating that its core is a fluid metal,
which boils in a way that generates the magnetism and also heats
other parts of its interior.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising to scientists are the hints that Callisto, the
outermost of the largest Jovian moons, may also have a subsurface
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Callisto does not appear to have an undifferentiated interior
with a dense core and other distinct layers. Nor is it subject to
the same flexing tidal forces that heat up the closer moons. But
the Galileo magnetometer has observed that Callisto seems to cause
the same kind of changes in the Jovian magnetic field as those
detected at Europa.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the current issue of Scientific American, Dr.
Torrence V. Johnson, the Galileo chief scientist, wrote: ``Somehow
Callisto must be hot enough to support an ocean but not so hot that
light and heavy materials separate. The water layer might be
sandwiched between a radioactively heated interior, where
convection keeps the material mixed, and a thin icy shell, where a
different convection cycle cools the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Flight controllers did not dare send Galileo into the blizzard
of Jovian radiation surrounding Io, the innermost of the major
moons, until all other mission objectives had been accomplished.
For all they knew, the radiation bombardment would disable or
destroy the spacecraft. But scientists had to get a closer look at
the churning forces of Io, which the two Voyagers had discovered to
be the most volcanically active body in the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo's first flyby, at a distance of 380 miles in October,
produced sharp pictures of Io's pizza-pie surface of brown, red and
yellow minerals; red-hot flows of lava at temperatures of 2,700
degrees; collapsing mountains, and fulminating volcanoes, more than
100 of them spewing lava and venting vapor plumes miles into space.
Scientists found Io to be an even more explosive fire-and-brimstone
place than they previously suspected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Io makes Dante's Inferno seem like another day in paradise,''
said Dr. Alfred McEwen of the University of Arizona in Tucson, a
member of the Galileo photo analysis team.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo survived the encounter, but not without some radiation
hits causing erratic performance of spacecraft electronics. More
than a month later, on Thanksgiving Day, the spacecraft was sent
even closer to Io, 186 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Blasted even harder by radiation, Galileo automatically turned
off its cameras and science instruments to protect them. Flight
engineers quickly radioed commands to take the craft out of this
safe mode and give it new operating instructions, including
software ``patches'' to work around damaged components and
unscramble garbled picture data.
</P>
<P>
   One spectacular picture caught a fiery fountain of lava shooting
more than a mile above the surface. The erupting lava was so hot
and bright, the project scientist Johnson said, that it blinded
part of the camera's electronic sensors and created a white blur in
the middle of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   While the volcanoes of Io sometimes reminded scientists of the
lava flows and pools at Kilauea in Hawaii, they are really like
nothing existing on Earth and in much of the solar system since its
formative period over four billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Io is the next-best thing to traveling back in time to Earth's
earlier years,'' Johnson said. ``It gives us an opportunity to
watch in action phenomena long dead in the rest of the solar
system.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 22, Galileo is scheduled to make one more close flyby of
Io. Two encounters with Ganymede are being planned for May and
December. Otherwise, Galileo's agenda is not clear, pending a NASA
decision on whether to go ahead with a full 14-month extension
called the Galileo Millennium Mission.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are still puzzled by the wide variations in radiation
levels in Jupiter's neighborhood. Engineers would like to fly
Galileo longer as a test of its performance in this harsh
environment. The spacecraft has already been exposed to twice the
radiation levels it was designed to withstand, and continuing study
could yield clues to improve the durability of future spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   On the drawing boards at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory are plans
for a spacecraft to orbit Europa, perhaps as early as 2008, and to
use radar to probe for the ocean that may lie deep in the icy moon.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the durability and longevity of spacecraft have counted
most, on long voyages to the outer planets of the sun, fortune has
smiled on American space scientists.
</P>
<P>
   There was plucky Pioneer 10, the first to reach Jupiter and then
Saturn in the early 1970s. Its five-watt radio signal could still
be heard, a decade later, as Pioneer became the first machine of
human design to leave the sun's planetary system.
</P>
<P>
   And there was Voyager 2. Cruising beyond Jupiter and Saturn, the
spacecraft survived the creakiness of old age to swing by the other
two outer giants, Uranus and Neptune, in the 1980s. Looking back,
Voyager 2 was still able to take a family portrait of the planets,
specks of light dancing around a stellar maypole.
</P>
<P>
   In the same tradition of hardihood, the Galileo spacecraft has
defied engineering's actuarial tables to complete more than four
years of orbiting Jupiter and taking in the sights of its four
major moons, each one a spectacle to the eye and a surprise to the
scientific mind.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo has transmitted stunning pictures of the more than 100
erupting volcanoes on Io, and clear evidence that Ganymede is the
only moon in the solar system to have its own magnetic field, and
data showing that an ocean may lurk below Callisto's surface ice
and, even more likely, in the depths of Europa.
</P>
<P>
   In an especially close encounter with Europa last month, the
spacecraft picked up strong signals of peculiar changes in
Jupiter's magnetic field at Europa.
</P>
<P>
   It is the most compelling evidence so far, scientists said last
week, of an electrically conducting material in Europa's
subsurface, like an ocean of salty water. Since liquid water is an
essential ingredient of life, these intriguing clues have
encouraged speculation that the first extraterrestrial life,
however simple, may be found in the seas of Europa.
</P>
<P>
   A report in the current issue of the journal Nature describes
how Jupiter's intense radiation could provide all the energy
necessary for chemical reactions to create and maintain living
organisms in a subsurface ocean, if one exists at Europa.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christopher Chyba of Stanford University proposed that in
the absence of sunlight for photosynthesis, the radiation
bombardment ``should produce organic and oxidant molecules
sufficient to fuel a substantial Europan biosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Galileo's enduring successes have been a happy surprise in view
of its early prospects, which were none too bright.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in 1989, Galileo took six years getting to Jupiter by a
circuitous route dictated by the power limitations at its sendoff.
The spacecraft's full capability has been hobbled by the failure of
the main antenna to unfurl and the erratic behavior of a tape
recorder. In the last year, repeated zappings from Jupiter's
intense radiation belts have damaged some spacecraft instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the spacecraft is reasonably healthy,'' said James
K. Erickson, the project manager at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
in Pasadena, Calif. ``We've survived much longer than anyone
thought we would.''
</P>
<P>
   As its engineers like to say, Galileo has kept going ``well past
its warranty.'' Designed to operate two years around Jupiter, the
spacecraft was cleared in December 1997 for a mission extension of
two more years. It has now been given another lease on life,
beginning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The length of the lease is problematic. Fuel for maneuvering the
craft is running low. Its gyroscopes for navigating are on their
last legs. And officials of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration are debating the cost-effectiveness of operating
Galileo for the full 14 additional months of operations requested
by scientists and engineers of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Their eagerness to keep Galileo going has been fed by its most
recent observations, especially those revealing the four largest
Jovian moons to be spectacularly diverse worlds. They were
discovered in 1610 by the spacecraft's namesake, Galileo Galilei,
who recognized in their orbits a kind of solar system in miniature
but had no inkling of what they looked like.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, the target of most of the Galileo
spacecraft's close encounters has been Europa. Scientists wanted a
better look at this ice-covered moon, about the size of Earth's
moon. They were intrigued by the many cracks running for a thousand
miles or more across an otherwise fairly smooth crater-free
surface. The cracked landscape reminded them of broken glass
repaired by an icy glue oozing up from below.
</P>
<P>
   This and other aspects of the surface geology suggested that a
layer of liquid water could lie beneath the outer shell of ice.
Scientists reasoned that the strong tidal forces of Jupiter caused
regular expansions and contractions of Europa. The flexing is the
most likely source of the heat in the moon's interior needed to
melt a layer of water between its outer icy surface and its rocky
interior, at a depth of perhaps 60 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Such conjecture has stirred wide interest among scientists
because liquid water is one of the essential ingredients of life.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 3, Galileo flew within 218 miles of Europa, about the
altitude that space shuttles often maintain above Earth and close
enough for detailed observations by the spacecraft's magnetometer.
</P>
<P>
   Europa lies within Jupiter's magnetic field, which changes
direction in the vicinity of Europa every five and a half hours.
This fluctuation can drive electrical currents in a conductor, like
an ocean of salt water.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo, scientists reported, detected the kind of magnetic
disturbances that would be predicted if the Jovian magnetic-field
variations had produced an electric current through a conductor on
Europa. Rock and solid ice are poor electrical conductors, but a
salt-water ocean would be perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these findings tell us that there is indeed a layer of
liquid water beneath Europa's surface,'' Dr. Margaret G. Kivelson,
a geophysicist at the University of California at Los Angeles, said
two weeks ago. ``I'm cautious by nature, but this new evidence
certainly makes the argument for the presence of an ocean far more
persuasive.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any doubt that that has moved us closer
to reality,'' Wilczek said. ``There were experiments whose outcome
was doubtful,'' but they later supported the theory, he said. ``So,
yes, we have understood more; it's not a social construction.''
</P>
<P>
   When pushed, physicists will often concede that there is room,
at least linguistically, to wonder how absolute the correspondence
is between successful theories and what might be regarded as
ultimate reality.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the spirit of philosophical empiricism, theories get
revised in light of fresh evidence that they cannot explain.
Sometimes the need for later revision is clear even as the theories
are being devised: nearly all modern theories of matter and energy
are called ``effective field theories.''
</P>
<P>
   That qualifier, ``effective,'' means physicists already know
that as the level of energy of things like particle collisions is
pushed higher and higher, the theory gives wrong answers and cannot
be trusted _ even though physicists may not be sure how to fix it
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we always required that our field theories would
at least mathematically be consistent up to the highest possible
energies,'' said Dr. Chris Quigg, a physicist at the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory. ``Now we admit the feeling of humility.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Newton's laws of motion, which hold that gravity
moves objects by applying a force on them at some distance from a
star or planet, were superseded by Einstein's general theory of
relativity. In that view, the objects move because gravity curves
space around them, leaving force-at-a-distance out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   These revisions, however, do not rattle physicists, since the
earlier theories almost always remain mathematically valid in some
way or other. Effective field theories will still work at low
energies, even after a fancier version is developed for higher
energies; Newton's laws hold when the strength of gravity, and the
curvature, are small.
</P>
<P>
   As Fuller's book recounts, Kuhn rejected many skeptical schools
of thought that were generated by his own ideas. But with varying
degrees, those schools assert that the forms taken by accepted
scientific theories, at any level, have as much to do with
ephemeral factors of politics, personal influence and historical
chance as with reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason one theory becomes dominant is because of locally
specific, social factors which then get a kind of institutional
momentum at one time,'' Fuller said of his own views, which do
allow for a connection between physics and reality. The distance
between the two views is so great that cliche-makers have coined
the term ``science wars'' to describe their interaction.
</P>
<P>
   In a more worrisome if less fraught metaphor, scientists, who
depend heavily on public financing for their work, may wonder if
the doubts will someday keep the tourists, so to speak, from
feeling an occasional need to visit the scientific paradise of
ideas. Without those tourist dollars, the debate could become moot
even as it remains unresolved.

THEORY, REALITY AND SKEPTICAL TOURISTS IN PHYSICS LAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J.)   (Science Times)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a Fodor's guide to Manhattan, the science of physics is
generally sold as the ultimate, indispensable, up-to-the-minute
guide to reality. The parallel is far from exact: physicists cannot
credibly tout their research as inexpensive and easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is one thing that the painstaking experiments and
deep thinking of physics are meant to produce, it is theories that
explain both the delights and the details of natural reality at its
most fundamental level.
</P>
<P>
   So it comes as unwelcome news to some physicists that just as
their field is enjoying unparalleled success, its relationship to
reality is being questioned with a pointedness not seen for
decades. Since the doubters are mostly nonphysicists _
philosophers, historians, even the public in general _ it is as if
tourists from Keokuk had begun questioning just how unimpeachable
the guidebooks are.
</P>
<P>
   In a quick-and-dirty definition, reality would begin with
elementary particles and the interactions that bind them to build
the universe that our instruments measure, our eyes see and our
hands touch. Physics, with its ambition of understanding these
building blocks at the most basic level, therefore becomes a prime
target for doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Some motives for this skepticism can be found in the 20th
century's scientific triumphs themselves, said Dr. George Levine,
director of the Center for the Critical Analysis of Contemporary
Culture at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's provoked by the overwhelming authority that
science has been able to accumulate,'' Levine said. ``There's a
sense that there are a few adepts, highly trained, who talk to each
other, and there is no point of entry for anyone outside that
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Driven by that sense of disenfranchisement, Levine said, anyone
can scour the annals of philosophy for potential wedges to separate
science from an immutable, objective reality that it seeks to
explain. Philosophical pragmatists and empiricists, for example,
hold that while a successful theory should describe experiments as
accurately as possible, it has no necessary relation to ultimate
reality, partly because one can never say whether new experiments
will give new results and force changes in the theory.
</P>
<P>
   More irksome to physicists is a school that finds its source in
``The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,'' a book first published
in 1962 by the philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn. In this school,
the form that theories take has as much to do with the politics and
sociology of science as with its duty to describe reality.
</P>
<P>
   The book seemed to show that science did not progress inevitably
toward a better and better representation of reality, but instead
that scientists moved from one ``paradigm,'' or theoretical
framework, to another based on social and psychological factors as
well as experimental ones.
</P>
<P>
   That view suggests that research in any paradigm brings science
``closer to answering its own questions,'' said Dr. Steve Fuller, a
sociology professor at the University of Warwick in England, whose
book, ``Thomas Kuhn: A Philosophical History for Our Times,'' is to
be published soon by the University of Chicago Press. ``But those
questions are autonomous from the bigger question of how close they
are getting to reality as such.''
</P>
<P>
   Measured against such doubts, physicists almost seem to be
inhabiting another universe. For one thing, physicists regard their
theories as much more than a Fodor-like compendium of detail.
</P>
<P>
   Theories like the one governing elementary particle physics are
based on simple principles with a distinct aesthetic appeal. And
physicists point out that they have a presumably objective arbiter
for deciding the correctness of a theory: how well its predictions
compare with experiments.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Dr. Frank Wilczek, a theoretical physicist at the
Institute for Advanced Study, and two other physicists came up with
the idea of asymptotic freedom, which held that the elementary
particles called quarks have the strange property that they feel
scarcely any mutual attraction when they are very near one another,
despite their powerful attraction when separated.

IN THE FINAL ACT, THE PLAYS WERE THE THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``The play is called `Z-Sliver,' '' Frank Wycheck
patiently explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's it called?'' asked several sportswriters, always unsure
of pro football's inner language.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Z-Sliver' It's where we have two routes on the same side,''
the Tennessee tight end elaborated. ``That's the way `Z-Sliver' is
designed, with the tight end on Kevin (Dyson's) side. We ran it
exactly the way it was drawn up.''
</P>
<P>
   Over on the other side of the bedlam in the Georgia Dome,
moments after the end of one of the most electrifying Super Bowls
ever, St. Louis offensive coordinator Mike Martz was detailing the
play he had called, the bomb to Isaac Bruce that he hoped would
resuscitate a struggling Kurt Warner and a struggling Ram offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what we call, `Twins Right, Ace Right, 999, Halfback
Balloon,' '' said Martz, patiently going over the terminology.
Twice before in that madcap fourth quarter, the Rams had gone
three-and-out, their confidence seemingly ebbing, especially _ and
precisely _ because of the plays that Martz had called on first
down.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, Martz had called runs for Marshall Faulk, runs that
went nowhere. In the first half, by contrast, when the Rams'
offense had its way between the 20-yard lines, St. Louis had 24
plays on first down and on 22 of those, Warner had dropped back to
pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we'd take a shot,'' said Martz of that Twins Right,
Ace Right, 999 Halfback Balloon call with 2:12 left in a Super Bowl
game suspensefully tied into a Houdini of a knot at 16-16. Indeed,
Martz had to take his shot because his wobbly Rams seemed ready to
lose this game despite dominating it for so long.
</P>
<P>
   Martz was asked, ``What does `999' mean?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The routes,'' he said. ``All nines. All gos.'' Go for the
gusto. Go for broke. Go for it all. 999.
</P>
<P>
   Those two plays, the Z-Sliver of the Titans _ also referred to
as ``Sliver Right'' by other members of the Tennessee clan _ and
the Twins Right of the Rams, are the essence of pro football, the
essence of sport, the reason why hundreds of millions of people
will spend a Sunday night in January watching a pro football game.
In a recent poll, 72 percent of respondents said they would
postpone their wedding date if they learned it fell on Super Bowl
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Obsessive? Sure.
</P>
<P>
   But Z-Sliver and Twins Right are the reasons why.
</P>
<P>
   They are ``big plays.'' Even a novice fan realizes that a tight
game is won because one player or two steps up at a most crucial
moment and makes a big play.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches obsess about ``big play'' players, general managers
lavish millions and millions of dollars on players precisely
because they are thought to be ``big play'' players, the ones who
will stand the tallest and make the difference in a close game.
College scouts fan out across the country looking for the right
size and weight and speed of a player, but also trolling for that
intangible quality of a ``big play player.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's never that simple. Can any scout or coach or general
manager tap into fate?
</P>
<P>
   Take the Rams and their Twins Right, which produced the decisive
73-yard TD pass from Warner to Isaac Bruce with barely two minutes
left.
</P>
<P>
   Look at it closely.
</P>
<P>
   See how it was Tennessee's Jevon Kearse who made the ``big
play'' on the play, see how the rookie made perhaps the play of his
brief pro career, the defensive lineman bowling over Rams tackle
Fred Miller, the same Miller who had handled Kearse so well for so
long in this game. Kearse bowled over Miller and crashed into
Warner just as the QB let the ball go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to him,'' said Kearse.
</P>
<P>
   And it was precisely because Kearse crashed into Warner that the
St. Louis QB's pass did not go as far as he wanted, that it was
short of Bruce, that Bruce _ as many receivers do _ was able to
step back and make the catch. The Titans' Kearse had made his big
play, but it was the Rams' Bruce who had made the big play of his
career and Warner the big play of his.
</P>
<P>
   Now come to that final drive of the Titans. Neither John Elway
nor Joe Montana nor Troy Aikman nor Terry Bradshaw nor Roger
Staubach ever led a Super Bowl drive _ given the circumstances _ as
did Tennessee's Steve McNair. With only one timeout left, and 88
yards to go in only 1:46, McNair made play after play after play.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge was there. The greatest challenge for an NFL
quarterback. And McNair responded. The next-to-last play of the
game, when he dropped back, circled out of trouble, then
stiff-armed and somehow escaped two Rams on his back and fired a
bullet to Dyson on the 10-yard line, was one of the greatest plays
in Super Bowl history.
</P>
<P>
   McNair displayed once and for all he had that intangible. The
``big play'' quality.
</P>
<P>
   And so Z-Sliver was called, and all the Titans did exactly as
planned, Wycheck going deep into the end zone to lure the defense
with him and Dyson delaying, slanting and cutting underneath.
McNair's throw was perfect, as was the catch of Dyson, who was
``sure I was getting in _ I saw the yellow right in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Big plays, big plays by all.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, who had been wobbly, had made their big play. Now
McNair and the Titans, who had been dominating, made their big
play.
</P>
<P>
   All on the last play of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Except Mike Jones made the biggest play of all. And there never
can be an argument about this: Mike Jones made the biggest tackle
in pro football history.
</P>
<P>
   Who could imagine?
</P>
<P>
   And it is why all of us watch sports and love sports.

IN JOB INTERVIEWS, E-MAIL ADDRESS MAY SEND WRONG MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Next time you go for a job interview, don't just fret about your
skirt length, tie color, or the firmness of your handshake. In
today's image-obsessed society, you might want to give some thought
to your e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   Does Smith(at)MindSpring.com reflect the creative you? Or should
you stick to something safe such as Smith(at)AOL.com?
</P>
<P>
   Most of us can't pick our home address, but we can choose our
personal e-mail address, and what we pick can say something about
our cyber know-how, our personality, and our frugality.
</P>
<P>
   One young man's job prospects with AT&AMP;T weren't helped when he
handed over a resume containing an e-mail address that read
(fictitious last name) Smith(at)Hotmail.com.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp.'s Hotmail may be one of the nation's biggest
free e-mail services, but some people can't help thinking of
something risque when they read ``hot.'' Others link HotMail with
junk e-mail, noting that unsavory companies are known to hijack
this free service to deliver unwanted messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me give you some advice,'' said Gary Morgenstern, an AT&AMP;T
public relations executive, to the unsuccessful job-seeking lad.
``Go out and get a new e-mail address.''
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of this new quandary is that you have so many
addresses to choose from. In the last two years, countless web
sites have offered free electronic mailboxes to anyone. You can
also get e-mail addresses through any Internet service provider,
some of which don't charge anything for their services.
</P>
<P>
   These choices can be bewildering, especially to the estimated 70
million, or two-thirds, of US households that still don't have a
private e-mail address. Do you want a personal mailbox linked with
the word MindSpring? Yahoo? Netscape? AT&AMP;T?
</P>
<P>
   While people care a lot about the speed and sophistication of
their e-mail service, many consumers, particularly those new to the
Internet, are also influenced by the sound of the address.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're starting brand-new with the Internet, you often want
to pick an e-mail address that appeals to you and says something
about you,'' said Emily Meehan, an analyst with the Yankee Group, a
Boston technology research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The most telling information is usually found in the last-half
of the address, referred to as the domain name. It has potentially
revealing information about your choice of Internet providers, web
sites or organization affiliations.
</P>
<P>
   Do you want to sound technologically ambitious as
Smith(at)MediaOne.Net? (MediaOne provides high-speed cable Internet
connections and costs more than most dial-up services.)
</P>
<P>
   Or are you willing to risk sounding cheap by going with one of
those freebie Internet services and becoming Smith(at)NetZero.com?
</P>
<P>
   If you're Smith(at)EarthLink.com, you may know you're with one
of the nation's large Internet service providers, in partnership
with Sprint, that gets high marks for consumer accessibility.
</P>
<P>
   And you might even know that the service was named Earthlink to
show the Internet's role, in the words of spokesman Kurt Rahn, in
``linking different parts of the Earth.'' But many people have a
different reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a wildlife type group,'' said Sara Massarello,
20, a sophomore at Boston University who has been weighing several
Internet options. ``It has an environmental sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer recently began offering free email services and
the suffix ``mac.com,'' to anyone who wants to be identified as a
Macintosh users.
</P>
<P>
   Several colleges and universities offer their institutions'
names in Internet addresses to alumni who want to be forever
identified with their alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   Image concerns don't usually come into play with work e-mail.
People ordinarily don't have control over their office e-mail
address and the domain name is generally the name of their company.
</P>
<P>
   With private e-mail, though, you can even craft your own domain
name. Web sites, such as Mail.com and Register.com, allow you to
pick a domain name that suits your personal style from a number of
domain names that they have rights to.
</P>
<P>
   At Mail.com, for instance, you can choose to be
Smith(at)Cheerful.com, Smith(at)InOrbit.Com or
Smith(at)DogLover.com. You can also choose domain names that
reflect your occupation, nationality or hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, many colleges have offered alumni the
option of using a school-related e-mail address, a nice perk if you
want to impress someone with your educational background. Harvard
University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for
instance, have an e-mail forwarding system for alumni. When e-mail
comes to Smith(at)post.harvard.edu, for instance, school officials
forward the mail to another e-mail account designated by the
alumnus.
</P>
<P>
   Some people care less about the words in the domain name, and
more about the simplicity of the entire address. They want
something that's easy to remember, prompting many of them to go
with Smith(at)AOL.com or Smith(at)Yahoo.com.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Grossman, a Boston lawyer, uses Yahoo for his private
e-mail because it's a well-known brand name, not because of any
affection for the site's reference to ``Yahoos,'' the coarse and
brutish race in Jonathan Swift's satire, ``Gulliver's Travels.''
</P>
<P>
   Juno may be the goddess of marriage and daughter of Saturn, but
one man said he picked Juno simply because it's a free e-mail
service with a simple four-letter domain name.
</P>
<P>
   Hotmail may seem like a catchy address, but its genesis is
actually quite mundane. A company spokeswoman said the original
company logo was HTML. This stands for Hypertext Markup Language,
which are the codes that help display web pages. The creators took
this code, then added the letters ``AI'' to form the phrase,
``HTMAIL.'' From that they jumped to ``HotMail.''
</P>
<P>
   As Yvonne Guzman hunts for a job these days, she plans on
abandoning her free e-mail account. The 30-year-old student thinks
a free service makes it look as though you move from place to
place. She now wants an e-mail address that shows she has a paid
Internet service provider (ISP), possibly MindSpring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you look more stable with a paid ISP,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When looking at an e-mail address, people's reactions vary
wildly depending on their familiarity with the companies operating
on the Internet, as well as their age. Younger folks generally are
more comfortable with off-beat names, while older people may prefer
more neutral addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Tecce, an associate professor of psychology at Boston
College, said he knows many folks who insist they don't make
judgments about others' e-mail addresses. He has even heard this
from male students who boast about their own ``Hot Male'' accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But Tecce said people ignore this phenomenon at their own peril,
perhaps proving they deserve to be Smith(at)Clueless.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to think they're above letting the sound of the
e-mail address affect them,'' he said. ``But on a subliminal or
unconscious level, it does affect them.''

VERMONT BILL TARGETS PEOPLE WITHOUT GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taking 200-year-old constitutional provisions for the creation
of a ``well-regulated militia'' to their most extreme conclusion, a
Vermont lawmaker has proposed a crackdown on Vermonters who do not
own guns.
</P>
<P>
   Harkening back to the days of town square militia musters and
citizens' armies, House bill 760 would require residents over 18
who do not own guns to register with the secretary of state's
office and pay a $500 penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Hot on its heels was House bill 763, also introduced Friday,
which would make military training a prerequisite for a high school
diploma in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The man behind both bills is state Representative Fred Maslack,
a two-term Republican legislator and quarry worker from East
Poultney. Maslack, a longtime proponent of gun-owners' rights, does
not expect a mass uprising or to see his bills voted into law.
</P>
<P>
   But he does fantasize about greeting gun-control activists and
liberal politicians at a grand muster of a citizen's militia under
the command of Vermont's Democratic governor, Howard Dean.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not state lawmakers want to admit it, Maslack said,
the right to carry arms comes with the obligation to serve in a
militia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this is supposed to do is illustrate what I consider to
be the only constitutionally correct view of this issue,'' Maslack
said. ``It certainly isn't politically correct, I can tell you
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Alongside Vermont's progressive approaches to land management,
gay marriage, and school funding is a strong lobby for gun-owners'
rights that some say is a natural outgrowth of its rural heritage.
Vermont has some of the country's least restrictive gun laws and
has one of the highest rates of membership in the National Rifle
Association. The state also allows all adults to carry a concealed
gun without a permit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, lawmakers on both sides of the gun-rights debate were
looking at Maslack's legislation with amusement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it's going to be taken seriously,'' said
Representative Ann Seibert (D-Norwich). ``There's a lot of common
sense in Vermont. You get heated issues, but common sense
prevails.''
</P>
<P>
   The two militia-related bills are not Maslack's first effort to
bolster the rights of Vermont gun owners. He joined two other state
representatives two weeks ago in suing three high-ranking public
officials on grounds of fraud and conspiracy in protest of
Vermont's enforcement of the Brady Law, which requires background
checks on gun purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   Bills 760 and 763, which he sponsored independently, aimed
chiefly to make a point about gun ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone gets focused on the right, and they forget about the
obligations,'' Maslack said. ``It's saying, if you have a military
obligation, then you have to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont has a proud militia tradition dating back to 1770, when
Ethan Allen formed an unauthorized citizens' militia to fend off
tax collectors from New York State. Article 9 of the Green Mountain
State's 1793 constitution requires financial contributions from
Vermonters ``scrupulous of bearing arms'' in a citizen's army.
</P>
<P>
   But historians said that the need for militias waned after the
American Revolution and that by the 1830s and 1840s, most of them
were poorly organized and undersupplied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record overall is that if we had depended on the militias,
we would all be drinking tea and eating scones at 4 o'clock,'' said
Saul Cornell, a historian at Ohio State University who is editing a
book on militias and the Second Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bellesile, an Emory University historian who has focused
on Vermont's movement, suggested that the fine prescribed by
Article 9 may have been designed to ``coerce people'' into coming
out for militia musters _ a goal achieved in other states by
supplying participants with alcohol, money, or free guns.
</P>
<P>
   But in one way, he said, Maslack's proposal falls squarely into
state tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vermonters take enormous pride in being just a little
different. They love to be curmudgeons and iconoclasts,'' said
Bellesile, a native of Quebec. ``This guy fits perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   No state has ever required its citizens to own guns, but
Maslack's plan had a precedent in the city of Kennesaw, Ga., in the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   City officials there said the requirement was largely symbolic,
but also boasted that crime rates fell dramatically in the years
that followed its introduction.

   Right after a neurological exam in December of 1998, Stephen
Heywood phoned his brother Jamie and reported the devastating
diagnosis in his typical understated style. ``The news does not
look good.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the verdict the close-knit Newton, Mass. family feared
for months. Stephen, then 29, had learned that the progressive
weakness that began in a single muscle in his right hand was Lou
Gehrig's disease, or ALS.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is terrifying stuff,'' said Jamie Heywood, 33, an
MIT-trained mechanical engineer. Jamie Heywood immediately quit his
job in San Diego at a brain research institute and moved his family
back to Newton. But first he pumped his colleagues for all they
knew about ALS, a brain- and spinal-nerve disease that paralyzes
one part of the body after another, leaving the mind intact but
eventually silencing speech and destroying even the ability to
breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Immersing himself in the science of ALS with the help of several
top scientists, Jamie began taking pieces of ALS research into his
own hands, raising more than a half-million dollars in private
donations. In less than a year, his effort has fast-forwarded three
potential therapies toward human trials, some of which could begin
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamie clearly is trying to save his brother's life,'' said
Jamie's wife, Melinda. ``And by extension, he's trying to save
everybody's life who has it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his quest Jamie joins a growing number of others who, with
rapidly lethal diseases threatening a family member, have launched
ambitious efforts to speed up research. One neurologist calls it
``guerrilla science,'' though it is neither illegal nor
clandestine. These families raise money, take shortcuts through
scientific bureaucracies, and knock on the doors of scientists whom
they fund and motivate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call and say, `We have a plane ticket for you, please be
on the plane with your slides,' '' said Dr. Evan Snyder, a
researcher at Children's Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder has been much sought after by brain disease groups
because he's experimenting with a new potential treatment based on
neural stem cells. These are naturally occurring brain cells able
to develop into different types of nerve cells: they show exciting
promise _ but no proof yet _ of being able to repair nervous system
damage in ALS and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said the new consumer-entrepreneurs ``often come from the
business realm and aren't used to the bureaucratic delays of
academia'' government, or large private organizations. ``They're
used to identifying a problem, pulling together the resources they
need and getting started,'' said Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Jamie Heywood did. Likewise, other ALS activist
groups like Project ALS _ which funds Snyder _ and the ALS
Treatment Initiative based in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   People whose lives are shadowed by rare diseases feel they have
to take direct action because drug companies have little interest
in diseases that don't promise a large scale payback. So there are
cutting-edge ideas languishing in laboratories for lack of someone
to push them into development.
</P>
<P>
   ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is rare, striking about
5,000 people in the United States each year. Most are much older
than Stephen: the average age at diagnosis is 55. About 30,000 are
alive with ALS at any one time. Four out of five ALS patients die
within five years of diagnosis. Only about 10 percent of cases are
inherited, but in the vast majority, it's a mystery as to why motor
neurons in the brain and spinal cord begin to die _ or why some
muscles are spared, including those involved in bladder, bowel and
sexual function.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent well-known ALS patient was Jim ``Catfish''
Hunter, the baseball player who died last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some long-term survivors of ALS add to the puzzle of why the
nerve cells die at dramatically varying rates. Famed physicist
Stephen Hawking, now in his mid-50s, was diagnosed with a form of
ALS at age 21. He has three children.
</P>
<P>
   The Heywoods have raised more than $500,000 through personal
appeals and the activities of the ALS Therapy Development
Foundation that they run out of a Victorian fixer-upper near
Crystal Lake. Behind it is a ramshackle carriage house that Stephen
_ a craftsman and carpenter before his illness _ plans to have
renovated to accommodate his worsening disability.
</P>
<P>
   As Jamie Heywood searched for the most promising leads toward an
ALS treatment, he decided the most likely quick-payoff strategy
would be gene therapy to alter the levels of a chemical messenger
in brain cells called glutamate. In ALS, an excess of glutamate
overstimulates and kills brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie and his scientist partners, Dr. Matthew During at
Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia and Dr. Jeffrey Rothstein
at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, planned an attack using
harmless viruses to carry a gene into the body, enabling nerve
cells to replace a key molecule called the glutamine transporter
that's missing or defective in ALS patients.
</P>
<P>
   In much less time than usual, the scientists and Jamie picked up
on some promising animal data, wrote up the complicated gene
therapy application, or protocol, and succeeded in January in
getting it approved by the ethics board at Jefferson. The
gene-carrying viruses would be injected into patients' spinal cords
in an effort to protect motor neurons.
</P>
<P>
   Still ahead lie review by a federal gene therapy board and the
US Food and Drug Administration. All gene therapy proposals are
coming under intense scrutiny now as the death of an Arizona youth
in a gene therapy experiment at the University of Pennsylvania
reverberates through science and government.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, after all his efforts on behalf of his brother,
Jamie has no power to pick who would be in a small group of
volunteers to get the initial treatments. ``But of course I hope
Stephen will be among them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of family-based groups has created some
tensions with large nationwide nonprofits like the ALS Association.
Taking a longer view, these traditional nonprofits have a more
conventional style of picking and funding researchers through a
grant application process.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Abendroth, research director at ALSA, said he empathized
with the family groups, but worries that their short-term focus on
treatments could ``fragment'' ALS research. ``I firmly believe we
have to cover the waterfront,'' he said. ``We have to look short
term and long term _ we cannot put all the chips on one or the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Another critic is Abbey Meyers, who heads the National
Organization for Rare Diseases in Fairfield, Conn. She said she
understands that affected people and their families don't want to
just sit back and wait for a cure that may not come for 100
years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the case of ALS, they have no clue as to what causes
it,'' suggesting that it is better to give money to an established
organization like ALSA, with a large scientific advisory board.
``Laymen cannot make knowledgeable decisions about who to give
money to,'' Meyers adds.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie, an intense and energetic man whose brain teems with
ideas, concedes it would be unfortunate if the groups siphoned off
money from the mainstream cause and wasted it on flaky projects.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he doesn't think that's happening _ especially since
many of the top scientists the families are working with are the
same ones that serve on advisory boards of the large nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   One of those scientists is Dr. Robert Brown, a neurologist and
leading ALS researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital. He is
Stephen's doctor. He's involved with ALSA as well as several of the
family groups, and he believes the activists definitely have
credibility.

MAYDAY: SIGNAL FROM BASEBALL IS DISTRESSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has anyone in Major League Baseball ever heard of Voltaire?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, no. He did not play defense alongside Doug Harvey for the
Montreal Canadiens. Francois Marie Arouet, a.k.a. ``Voltaire,'' was
a rather renowned 17th century French philosopher who said many
things, the most lasting of which was, ``I disapprove of what you
say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.''
</P>
<P>
   And while we're on the subject, has anyone in Major League
Baseball ever heard of the United States Constitution, the First
Amendment of which, as every high school civics student is supposed
to know, pertains to free speech?
</P>
<P>
   This is a wonderful country, not in the least because it allows
freedom of expression to all its citizens, drawing the line at such
things as advocating the violent overthrow of the government.
Nowhere does it say anything about the sanctity of the 7 Train.
</P>
<P>
   That John Rocker is not an enlightened social critic is beyond
debate. His PR-oriented half-baked apology on ESPN further
demonstrated what a general loser he is. He is what he is, at least
for the present. Hey, but he's young. Perhaps he'll learn something
from all this.
</P>
<P>
   True to ultra-modern form, L'Affaire Rocker has brought out the
worst in more people than just John Rocker. Chiropractic has
undoubtedly benefited from the predictable rash of liberal
knee-jerk overreactions to Rocker's inane comments in Sports
Illustrated about his fellow Americans. Now comes the ultimate
piling-on maneuver: Baseball commissioner Bud Selig has suspended
Rocker until May 1, declaring that the remarks ``offended
practically every element of society.''
</P>
<P>
   A bit hyperbolic, that, but there is no question that Rocker's
flippant dismissals of AIDS patients, single mothers, and
immigrants of color _ not to mention, frankly, just about everyone
in America who doesn't look like John Rocker, his immediate family
members, or his buddies back home _ offended millions of people in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those offended should simply consider the source and
move on. OK, easy for a middle-aged Caucasian male to say. But,
geez, it's not as if Rocker is contemplating a run for office.
Let's all get a grip. He is a 25-year-old relief pitcher who has
been gifted by his maker with a strong left arm. Period.
</P>
<P>
   He is not a spokesman for America, the state of Georgia, the
city of Atlanta, the National League, Major League Baseball, or
even relief pitchers, lefthanded or otherwise. He is one biased
cracker, no more and no less.
</P>
<P>
   And he is protected by more than just Voltaire's rhetoric. He is
_ or, at least he should be _ by the Constitution of the United
States of America. What makes America great is that the John
Rockers of this world have every right to stand up and reveal their
essential ignorance, just as we have every right to rebut each of
their outrageously uninformed viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, this suspension is ludicrous, and anyone who
respects our cherished system of government should demand its
immediate overturn.
</P>
<P>
   Selig thinks otherwise. He is concerned about the game's image,
which is understandable, since he is the game's chosen guardian.
``Major League Baseball takes seriously its role as an American
institution and the important social responsibility that goes with
it,'' said Selig in explaining his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Very noble. Very pious. Very irrelevant. Throughout the history
of baseball, bigotry and ignorance have never been in short supply.
Selig cannot be held responsible for baseball's past, of course. He
wasn't around when the Philadelphia Phillies, led by Grade A racist
manager Ben Chapman, heaped vile abuse on Jackie Robinson when the
latter broke into baseball. He wasn't around when Ty Cobb, another
first-rank racist, was the game's greatest player. He wasn't around
when Cap Anson, whose rank bigotry was the equal of both Chapman's
and Cobb's, used his influence to close off baseball to people of
color for almost 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Selig had been there, would he have been within his
rights to discipline Chapman just for being a racist? The answer is
no. What Chapman did was despicable, but he wielded no influence
other than filling out his own lineup card. Then and now, an acid
tongue is protected by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker should have to worry about only one set of judges and one
jury. His offensive remarks are the concern of his own manager,
coaches, and teammates. Strictly speaking, no one else in baseball
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker is already paying an appropriate price. He is a national
frame of reference for ignorance, the butt of jokes from Caribou to
Chula Vista.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner is a very decent man from America's heartland,
and he has soared to great rhetorical heights in denouncing
Rocker's regrettable declarations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The terrrible example set by Mr. Rocker is not what our great
game is all about,'' thunders the commissioner, ``and, in fact, is
a profound breach of the social compact we hold in such high
regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Touching? Yes. But germane? No. John Rocker is an embarrassment
to all concerned, but, ultimately, he is Atlanta's embarrassment.
Retribution is necessary, but trampling constitutional rights we
hold dear is not the answer. Fear not. John Rocker's legitimate
retribution will take place in the Atlanta locker room.

SAD TALE OF GARRINCHA FAMILIAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Manoel Francisco Dos Santos, a.k.a. Garrincha, might have been
the most beloved of Brazilian soccer players, even moreso than Pele
in many ways, because of the way he overcame adversity.
</P>
<P>
   While Pele was almost the perfect player and led a relatively
charmed life, Garrincha was rejected by several teams before
winning over the directors of Botafogo. And coaches retained their
doubts _ only a passionate lobbying effort by the players persuaded
Vicente Feola to bring Garrincha to the Selecao for the 1958 World
Cup. Then, the team psychologist had determined that Garrincha had
the intelligence level of an 8-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Garrincha was a slight figure with a malformed leg because of
polio, and had enough indigenous blood in his veins to make some
people uncomfortable. But starting on the day he embarrassed the
great Botafogo defender Nilton Santos during a tryout, Garrincha
experienced great success. Incredibly, Brazil did not lose a game
with Garrincha in the lineup from 1957 until a 3-1 loss to Hungary
in Liverpool in the '66 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   But Garrincha's descent was equally as dramatic. Alcoholism
sapped him and he died destitute and institutionalized at age 50 on
Jan. 20, 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Diego Maradona has a similar tragic flaw. Maradona is addicted
to drugs, and will continue to be unless he finds a support group.
Now, Maradona is undergoing treatment in Havana. But he is still
surrounded by many of the same figures and will likely return to
the same environment that triggers his habit.

   Joe-Max Moore, the Revolution's all-time leading scorer, scored
for Everton in a 2-0 win over Preston North End in a fifth-round FA
Cup game in Liverpool. Moore replaced Francis Jeffers in the 88th
minute and converted a rebound off a shot by Kevin Campbell three
minutes later. Everton appears headed toward stability, as
entertainment impresario Bill Kenwright will take over a majority
stake in the club. Kenwright was a classmate of Paul McCartney and
promoted the Beatles, among others . . . The next MLS striker to
depart could be Jeff Cunningham of Columbus. Cunningham, 23, had 15
goals in 33 games last season. His contract ends after this season,
and he is being scouted by English and Mexican teams, who will
certainly offer more than the approximately $40,000 salary he is
currently earning.

   The MLS has wisely decided to scrap the preseason experiment of
a two-referee system. Perhaps league officials heard what Milan
coach Alberto Zaccheroni had to say about the system, which is
being used during Coppa Italia matches. ``The two-referee system
doesn't work,'' Zaccheroni told La Reppublica. ``It seems to me
there are always going to be mistakes and they are not being
reduced with two referees on the field. This way, nothing changed.
If we are looking for solutions, it would be more effective to
place two line judges behind the goal. It has been seen that there
is not a physical problem _ our referees are prepared physically,
in fact they are the best in the world.'' When the MLS began,
former World Cup referee Vinnie Mauro forecast that the refs would
need at least three or four years of experience before they would
reach a proper level of competence. It's time for the MLS
refereeing system to advance to the next level . . . Questions are
being raised about the selection of general managers in the MLS,
especially as John Borozzi keeps getting bypassed. Borozzi's
credentials appear in order _ he was recruited for the US Olympic
team program, became a professional player in Philadelphia in the
NASL, was a successful administrator and assistant coach with the
Baltimore Blast indoor team, deputy commissioner of the Major
Indoor Soccer League, and respected assistant general manager with
the Columbus Crew. Borozzi, director of corporate sales for the
Miami Fusion, has credibility on many fronts. Meanwhile, Columbus
recently hired a general manager with, literally, no soccer
experience _ at least according to the press release. Jim Smith,
who replaced Jamey Rootes with the Crew, was likely exposed to
soccer at some level since he happens to be from Connecticut. If
so, it would be beneficial to mention that he has some concept of
the game.

   We do not know the advertising budget of the US Soccer
Federation. But its vehicles for promotion are the teams, and
though televising away games can be quite complicated, the
Federation simply must find a way to make it easy to view games
such as Saturday's in Coquimbo. The US's first win in South America
since 1995 could not have occurred much more dramatically as Cobi
Jones converted in the 88th minute of a 2-1 victory over Chile . .
. Yugoslavian soccer should undergo a change for the better
following the assassination of the paramilitary leader Zeljko
Raznjatovic, a.k.a. Arkan, according to the Belgrade weekly Vreme.
Arkan controlled Obilic, and quickly vaulted what had been an
obscure club into the elite competitions of Europe. ``With
corruption, threats, and money, (Arkan) made his modest Obilic one
of the strongest Yugoslavian teams, ahead of the prestigious Red
Star and Partizan,'' Vreme said. ``The Federation knew very well
but could never do anything about it. Arkan, just by appearing on
the field, intimidated referees and opposing players.''

   Nigeria captain Sunday Oliseh criticized the behavior of fans
after a 0-0 tie with Congo in the African Nations Cup. The
spectators attacked team members and were dispersed by police at
the National Stadium in Lagos Friday, leading to threats that the
Nigerians would have to ban fans entirely from the rest of their
games. Nigeria will have to at least tie Morocco Thursday to
advance to the second round. But any home-field advantage appears
to have disappeared for Nigeria. Officials had listed tickets at
about 100 naira ($1 US) in an attempt to attract crowds. The
strategy worked, though even that price was considered high in a
country where the average salary is $30 per month. But now the
pressure of the home crowd could have a negative effect on the team
. . . Boris Becker, who has been offered a position with Bayern
Munich by president Franz Beckenbauer, announced that his
management group will represent athletes such as Milan striker
Andriy Shevchenko. ``He is the superstar of the future,'' Becker
said. ``At the moment we only have a few under contract but, like
him, all are first-class jewels.'' Shevchenko, 22, is the latest
product of Dynamo Kiev, the dominant Ukrainian club. He converted
all of Milan's goals in a 3-0 victory over Perugia Sunday and leads
Serie A with 14 goals.

   Moreover, he said that the family movement has come at a
propitious time, when biological science and technology offer much
to the effort to cure brain diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Brown says that the ALS families aren't just desperate people
grasping at straws. They are bringing their energy and money to the
ALS problem at a time when the science has unprecedented potential
to slow down or even cure brain diseases. Among the new avenues are
gene therapy and the use of ``gene chips'' that can analyze
thousands of genes at once to find out what goes wrong in an
ALS-affected nerve cell.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest ticket in brain medicine, however, centers on the
neuronal stem cells that Snyder maintains in a culture in his lab.
Last year, he showed that infusions of mouse neural stem cells into
the brain would migrate to areas of nerve damage and turn
themselves into neurons, and alleviated a nerve disease.
</P>
<P>
   Project ALS in New York, established by the family of Jenifer
Estess, 37, a theater producer who's severely disabled by the
disease, is funding Snyder in a collaboration with Rothstein at
Johns Hopkins University and Brown at MGH. Snyder said they are
currently testing neural stem cells in monkeys, and that human
trials might be mounted in two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ``guerrilla science'' activists directly fund their
chosen scientists without the cumbersome review process that the
National Institutes of Health requires, that doesn't mean they
ignore safety and ethical reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not skipping any steps, but doing them all at the same
time,'' said Jamie, adding that this strategy saves time by
carrying out required tests in parallel instead of sequentially.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen months after his diagnosis, Stephen has lost much of
the use of his right arm, his left is weakening, and he walks
unsteadily, sometimes falling. ``What's hard is needing help with
something you could do by yourself the week before,'' said Stephen,
who was amid his first major house renovation when his right hand
began to fail.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, while Jamie helped him eat by cutting his
food, Stephen said, ``No matter what stage you're in, you find it
is something you can deal with as long as it doesn't get any
worse.'' But what's so frustrating, he added, ``is that as soon as
you think you can handle it _ it gets worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen is the second of three sons of John and Peggy Heywood:
their father is an automotive engineering researcher at MIT. He and
Peggy are pillars of the congregation of Grace Episcopal Church in
Newton, where Stephen is to be married later this month to Wendy
Stacy, an administrator at the Harvard University biological
laboratories. By coincidence, another member of Grace's relatively
small congregation was recently diagnosed with ALS.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by his grim prognosis, Stephen and Wendy plan to have
children and continue to enjoy life and travel _ though on a trip
to Australia last month with the youngest Heywood son, Ben,
Stephen's limitations were more trouble than ever, Jamie said last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Heywood says of her Stephen, ``He's just remarkable. I
don't know how he deals with the loss of his hand and arm. We all
say he does better than the rest of us would.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the MGH neurologist, speaks calmly and clinically about
ALS and the fight to cure it. After all the patients he's seen,
he's asked, does he get used to it?
</P>
<P>
   ``No. . .no, no, God, no,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all die of their disease. We've got to do better.''

<P>
   Come Saturday you have another chance to usher in the New Year _
this time the Chinese Year of the Dragon, which marks the 4,698th
year on the Chinese lunar calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Feasting is an integral part of the holiday, which signifies a
new beginning with the hopes of good luck and prosperity for family
and friends. Tradition dictates that old debts and obligations be
paid off, homes be renewed and cleaned, and new clothes be
purchased in anticipation of the New Year. Decorations throughout
the house and on the table symbolize themes of happiness, wealth
and long life. Red symbolizes happiness and good luck, while gold
signifies wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese zodiac is centered around 12 animals, and according
to Chinese lore, personality traits are influenced by the animal
ruling the year in which a person is born. Individuals born in
dragon years (1940, 1952, 1964, 1976, 1988 and 2000) are considered
to be magnanimous, full of vitality and strength, egotistical and
whimsical with short tempers. The Year of the Dragon is also
considered a good year to get married, have children or start a new
business, as the benevolent dragon is said to bring good fortune
and happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome the New Year in style with the re-creation of a
bountiful assortment of dishes inspired by the menu selections at
Kung Pao Bistro (restaurant locations in Sherman Oaks and Studio
City, Calif.). They're the vision of owner and restaurateur Jimmy
Chi, a native of Taiwan whose family is Chinese. Chi came to the
United States more than 25 years ago and has worked and owned
Chinese restaurants in the Southern California area ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to cook.'' Besides Chinese food, he dabbles in
American, Cajun and Japanese food, but eats Southwestern and
Mexican cuisine when he dines out. And when he's not cooking, he
still enjoys a Chinese meal at his mother's home in Long Beach.
``She's a great cook,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Chi's philosophy of cooking revolves around using top-quality
fresh ingredients. Unlike some of his counterparts in Chinese
establishments, Chi is totally against using MSG (monosodium
glutamate) and doesn't stock any in his kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use sugar to bring out the flavor of a dish, or in the case
of soup, I use a good chicken base.'' Kikkoman is the soy sauce he
uses and recommends.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to cooking at home, Chi is quick to point out that
it is a bit different, as home cooks don't have the high heat
available in restaurant kitchens. (Chi demonstrated a couple of
dishes in the Sherman Oaks restaurant kitchen, and they were
completed with lightening speed). Home cooks will have to be more
patient _ it will take longer to stir-fry dishes, he points out.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate the holiday, Chi, his family and employees will
have dinner in a restaurant on Friday night, the eve of the Chinese
New Year. Traditional New Year's food includes steamed dumplings,
which look like gold and mean prosperity; fish, which represents
fortune and prosperity; sweet rice cakes (on New Year's Day
morning), which signify long life; and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Now, back to dishes that home cooks can whip up for a festive
and sizzling New Year's celebration at home. Pick and choose what
you can manage and what your time schedule will allow from the
replica creations here. If you plan to serve only one or two
creations, you might want to double the recipes, depending on the
number you'll be serving. Be sure to accompany with lots of rice
and tea.
</P>
<P>
   Chi refers to his Kung Pao menu selections as Mandarin cuisine
with a California twist. To make his creations light and healthy,
Chi rinses off the oil by submerging fried items in a huge kettle
of boiling water prior to adding the sauces or combining with other
ingredients. In our copycat versions included today, we kept the
oil to a minimum and found it wasn't necessary or practical to go
to those lengths.
</P>
<P>
   For something unusual and very different, give Twinkle Walnut
Shrimp a whirl. It sounds weird, but it's delicious. It goes
together in a jiffy with raw, shelled and deveined shrimp with the
tails on (you can find the shrimp frozen, ready to use at Trader
Joe's and other markets). After coating with a cornstarch-egg white
mixture, fry in a large wok in very hot oil over high heat until
the shrimp turns pink.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the oil is not hot enough, the cornstarch will peel off,''
advises Chi. Once cooked _ we did ours in two batches to keep the
oil as hot as possible _ the shrimp is tossed with mayonnaise mixed
with whipping cream (the restaurant uses evaporated milk) and lemon
juice. Serve atop blanched green beans or broccoli florets, and top
with Carmelized Walnuts.
</P>
<P>
   The walnuts are a bit tedious to make as they involve several
steps, but we streamlined the recipe to use the microwave oven and
stovetop. Make them a day or two in advance, if desired, and store
in an airtight food container _ or if you don't want to bother,
simply top the shrimp with toasted walnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Tasters raved about our replica version of the Filet Mignon in
Brown Sauce. If you're gathering a crowd, be sure to make lots.
It's a breeze to assemble with small chunks or thin slices of filet
mignon, onion chunks and mushroom slices that have been stir-fried
with a mixture of soy sauce, oyster sauce, dry sherry, garlic and
sugar thickened with cornstarch. Serve ringed with broccoli florets
and a side of rice to sop up all the juices.
</P>
<P>
   Also a hit with diners were two versions of hot and spicy Kung
Pao dishes _ one with chicken and one with beef. The copycat
chicken variation combines chicken breast with diced zucchini, red
bell pepper chunks, sliced fresh mushrooms and chopped green onions
and a few pinches of red pepper flakes (or you can used dried red
chiles). The sauce relies on soy, dry sherry, rice vinegar, sugar,
ginger and cornstarch. Instead of using the dried red chiles, which
look terrific but are too hot for most tasters, we opted to zip up
the sauce with a little chile paste with garlic. Top with peanuts
for good eating.
</P>
<P>
   In the beef version on the same theme, use sirloin steak cut
into thin strips and then cut into smaller pieces. Attractively
presented in a delicious sauce with red bell pepper pieces, snow
peas and green onions, this creation is a winner. No peanuts
included in this rendition.
</P>
<P>
   To round out a menu _ and for a side dish _ toss together an
assortment of steamed fresh or a combination of fresh or frozen
vegetables and bind with a little chicken broth, sherry, cornstarch
and garlic. The restaurant's medley includes napa cabbage,
broccoli, string beans, baby corn, carrots, bok choy, mushrooms
(including canned straw mushrooms and Chinese black mushrooms),
water chestnuts and spinach leaves. Our combination is a bit
different, but just as beautiful and tasty.
</P>
<P>
   And if you feel inclined to try your hand at a noodle dish, our
duplicate version with peanut sauce couldn't be simpler. Cook dry
Chinese egg noodles (resembling thin spaghetti) or vermicelli as
desired, and toss with an uncooked peanut sauce. Serve as the
restaurant does over greens mixed with shredded carrots and bean
sprouts to contrast with the noodles.
</P>
<P>
   Mix and match our replica creations for Chinese New Year or next
time you're in the mood for Chinese fare. Or head to Kung Pao
Bistro for a special New Year's dinner celebration. Gung Hay Fat
Choy! &QL;

SUPER BOWL RATINGS DIDN'T MATCH THE EXCITEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Super Bowls go, Sunday's Rams-Titans thriller had one of the
most exciting fourth quarters in history, right up there with the
1989 game that featured Joe Montana driving the 49ers downfield in
the final minute to beat the Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   But as for ratings, Sunday's game earned only a 43.2, with a 62
share, making it the 19th-highest rated Super Bowl in history.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the game featured two smaller-market teams, it
provided more excitement than most Super Bowls. Last year's game,
in which the Broncos beat the Falcons, 34-19, on Fox, was one of
the lowest-rated in Super Bowl history, with a 40.2 rating and 61
share.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-rated Super Bowl was 1982's, when the 49ers beat the
Bengals the first time. The game earned a 49.1 rating. Next year's
game between the Redskins and Dolphins pulled a 48.6, and the
Bears' whipping of the Patriots in 1986 earned a 48.3.
</P>
<P>
   And by the way, Super Bowl XXXIV wasn't the first NFL title game
that ended with a dramatic defensive stop. In the 1960 game between
the Philadelphia Eagles and Green Bay Packers _ Vince Lombardi's
first title game _ Chuck Bednarik stuck Jim Taylor at the 8-yard
line and apparently sat on him until the clock ran out. (It's
always nice having Bob Ryan hanging around your desk before.)
</P>
<P>
   Play-by-play man Al Michaels made the best of the Super Bowl.
His opening _ ``The meek finally inherited the earth'' _ was
priceless.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Boomer Esiason was solid. He demonstrated the value of
having a former pro in the booth with his commentary about Blaine
Bishop's injury. The line about players appreciating the applause
from the crowd was revealing and poignant. But Boomer also got into
a little of a ga-ga mode when he kept marveling over what a
``specimen'' Eddie George is and how the Titans back has ``never
missed a start.''
</P>
<P>
   Sideline reporter Lesley Visser was horrible. Her green suit
resembled something from a high school majorette collection, and
her kissy-face interview with John Elway was pathetic. Elway was no
dummy; he used Visser to promote his new Internet venture. (Hey,
Disney, get Solomon Wilcots on the sidelines for every big NFL
game.) At least Lynn Swann got the news on Bishop's injury in a
timely fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ABC had excellent replays of George's second touchdown, clearly
showing that his knee touched the ground before he scored.
</P>
<P>
   The feature segments of ABC's pregame coverage weren't as bad as
they sounded, but the View was horrible. Come one. Baggy football
pants? Tight butts? And can someone wake up Charles Gibson?
Michaels should have interviewed Dick Vermeil and Jeff Fisher, not
Charley.
</P>
<P>
   Did we have to suffer through Chris Berman talking about Chris
Berman for four hours? After an interesting piece on Fritz Pollard,
the first African-American coach and player in the NFL, Berman told
viewers that he, too, attended Brown University. Then, after Berman
recounted his top 10 Super Bowl moments _ the best being the Jets'
upset of the Colts _ ABC showed a slow-motion video of Berman
running off the field in the Orange Bowl in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Hello, Mike Tirico. He is the Man, period, and needs to have a
bigger presence. He handled the postgame coverage superbly, largely
because of one fact: He never tried to be bigger than the game.
Let's give Berman the benefit of the doubt, and say it was a long
NFL season and it's time for a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gray area
</P>
<P>
   Jim Gray bashing continued last weekend, as Mike Tyson became
the latest to throw dirt on the sideline reporter. While
interviewing Tyson shortly after his two-round bout with Julius
Francis, Gray told Tyson that he should wipe his nose. ``I'm a big
enough man to squash you and be your friend,'' Tyson answered,
``and I'm a friend of Pete Rose.''

ATTACKS BACKFIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; PETERBOROUGH, N.H. &UR;  &LR;  _ Last summer, even with free ice cream,
John McCain couldn't have attracted two-dozen people to his first
meeting with voters here.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday they filled the public assembly hall in this
famously gorgeous community (the inspirational site of Thornton
Wilder's ``Our Town'') _ a solid 1,600 of them _ to chuckle at his
stand-up, poke him with skeptical questions, nod unconsciously when
he agreed with some of his fans only to challenge them to reach out
to those who don't agree, and know that they were witnessing
something special in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley could have ended up the New Hampshire primary like
McCain, basking in respect, enjoying the game, and proud of having
created genuine policy alternatives for conservatives and
independents alike.
</P>
<P>
   But on the ``change'' side of this cycle's equation, it was John
McCain who won the role of Thornton Wilder's metaphorical stage
manager _ in charge and leading, but always gently and reasonably.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, whom I also shadowed on this strange day, chose instead
to be Sampson, pushing on the walls of his party with a torrent of
invective even more bitter and personal than his attacks last week
in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss the point here. Bradley can easily win, and McCain
can just as easily lose. The point is the implications of both
possible events.
</P>
<P>
   IF McCain loses, he would get a mass bow worthy of the Tennessee
Titans for a valiant effort that just fell short. George W. Bush
would get full credit, and not just for rising to McCain's spirited
challenge and coming from behind to beat him.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign took at least two hard looks _ one right after
Iowa last week and one last weekend _ at going as negative on
McCain as Bradley has on Gore.
</P>
<P>
   For two reasons _ one strategic and one tactical _ the governor
decided against invective. For one thing, the reasoning was that it
would be better to win on a higher plane for the usual task of
stitching the Republican Party back together for a general
election.
</P>
<P>
   For another, if McCain hangs on to win, better to go toward the
megastate primaries without the black mark of attack campaigning
next to the Bush name. The decision not to brand McCain some kind
of untrustworthy traitor could always be revisited before the Feb.
19 South Carolina primary.
</P>
<P>
   But in Bradley's case, after having fallen behind this month, a
comeback that nips Gore could be attributable only Bradley's
attacks on Gore's character and integrity over the last week.
Taking that message national, into arenas where character attacks
are blood sport (like New York, Ohio, and California, for starters)
would risk opening deep rifts among Democrats and would challenge
the allegiance of the vast majority of them to the policies of the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, the McCain-Bush and Bradley-Gore contests were
neither fundamentally different nor outside the bounds of normal
give-and-take politics. The main elements _ my plan's better than
your plan; my experience is richer than yours; some of your votes
and decisions from the past are inconsistent with your present
stands; you have the establishment I have the people _ are
traditional. There's always hype, but above all, there was debate,
as well as debates.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley changed all that. When Bush went after details of
McCain's ideas, McCain defended and countered; the public learned
things, and so did the participants. When Gore and Bradley went
after each other's proposals starting last fall, the same thing
happened, until Bradley appeared to be losing the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Since the final days in Iowa, stripped of euphemisms, this is
what Bradley has had to say about Gore: He's a tobacco prostitute,
a Willie Horton-introducing, lying, untrustworthy, possibly illegal
fund-raiser who is unfit for the Oval Office and not committed to
protecting a woman's right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   Behind this assault is an oddly Olympian view of self. In a
gathering in Exeter, Bradley offered ``a world of new possibilities
guided by goodness'' while a supporter warmed up the audience by
saying Bradley ``encourages us to be better people by his
example.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has had to sit through sinister suggestions that he
is a tempestuous wacko who peddles influence for campaign cash, has
never lost his cool. He has sharp elbows and is not be trifled
with, but it is his relationship with the people that has made him
the star of the campaign, win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his 104th town meeting here, a fellow asked him if
he would support, after years of broken promises, a full funding of
the federal share (40 percent) of the costs of mandated special
education.
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely, McCain replied, but only if you make sure that only
truly needy and eligible kids get in such programs.
</P>
<P>
   That candor and directness have made McCain the champion of
those yearning for a new, accommodative politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley could easily have been that candidate, but at crunch
time, to twist a line from a poet from Vermont, he took the road
more traveled by, and that has made all the difference.

NO USE TRYING TO BUCK THIS TREND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We were looking at final proofs of the story when a fellow
editor said, ``Hey, what's this word butt-naked? Isn't it supposed
to be buck naked?''
</P>
<P>
   The guy we were quoting had, in fact, said butt-naked, but that
didn't answer the larger question. What ever happened to buck
naked? Not so long ago, that was a standard emphatic term for
totally, utterly unclothed. (Redundant, maybe _ naked is naked, say
the purists _ but language, like food, would be bland without some
optional garnishes.) When did butt-naked begin to edge aside the
old standby?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer (short answers are the ones you can research on
the Lexis/Nexis database of publications) is that butt-naked got
its big boost into the mainstream from rap music. The earliest
mentions aren't about rap _ the first is a 1985 Associated Press
story from St. Louis (``I saw this child butt naked and him
half-clothed. I screamed at him to let her go''), and the following
year a Washington Post story gives ``butt naked'' as a nickname for
the drug PCP. But in 1989, Ice-T's ``Girls Let's Get Butt-Naked'' _
the short version of an unprintable title _ provokes a flurry of
citations, and butt-naked is quickly adopted for both another song
title and a group's name. No doubt Howard Stern, with his
bare-it-all proclivities, and ``NYPD Blue,'' with its fondness for
full dorsal nudity, did their part to make butt-naked seem the
obvious term.
</P>
<P>
   More mystifying, maybe, is why it was buck naked to start with.
Buck, in Old English, was a male deer or goat; the meaning was
extended to a few other animals and then, as early as 1303, to
human males. In 18th- and 19th-century England, a young buck was
``a gay, dashing fellow; a dandy, fop,'' says the Oxford English
Dictionary; ``The dashing young buck, driving his own equipage,''
was an object of envy, often tinged with the disapproval of his
less flamboyant elders.
</P>
<P>
   But the 19th century also brought a less benign meaning to buck.
English-speaking colonials (and former colonials) applied the word
to North and South American Indians, to Australian aboriginals, and
to blacks _ especially slaves _ in ways that clearly implied their
racial inferiority: ``The buck aborigine takes more solid comfort
than the female of his tribe,'' commented an observer in 1879.
Given this context, buck naked might well have been inspired by the
clothing of the people being described, which tended to be skimpy
by Victorian standards.
</P>
<P>
   There's no firm evidence that buck naked carries a racist taint,
and certainly plenty of people have used it without suspecting any
such thing. But the Dictionary of American Regional English finds
the early written examples _ from the 1920s and '30s _ in the
mouths of Southern black characters; even in the '60s, DARE's
survey found buck naked used primarily in the South. And the
pronunciation given in the latest American Heritage Dictionary,
published in 1992, is still the distinctly Southern buck nekkid.
</P>
<P>
   As it moved out of the South, though, buck naked was rapidly
acquiring variants. When DARE surveyed American speakers on the
usage, between 1965 and 1970, most of them gave buck naked as the
synonym for ``no clothes on at all.'' But the researchers also
heard buck-ass naked, buck-born naked, stark buck naked, bum naked,
and _ in New York and Michigan _ butt naked. (No, Howard Stern and
Ice-T were not among the respondents.)
</P>
<P>
   This may buttress the theory of Gene Owens, who in 1996 opined
in the Greensboro, N.C., News &AMP; Record that no native-born
Southerner would use butt-naked, and that it probably ``originated
with some Yankee who was hard of hearing.'' That's essentially what
the Ask a Linguist experts said, too, when someone inquired about
butt-naked on their Web site (http://linguistlist.org) in 1997.
``People have `folk-etymologized' the expression,'' said one,
revising an opaque term into one that's easily understood.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists will be cheered by the news that even now, in
the first month of the new century, the print media are sticking
with buck naked over butt-naked, by a ratio of 4 or 5 to 1. This
may just reflect print's prudishness, however. Given the obscurity
of buck (outside deer hunting circles) and the word's tenuous
connection to nudity, butt-naked is probably the one to bet on.

NEW SHIPS, FEATURES AND REASONS TO SAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's is it going to will it take to get you on a cruise?
</P>
<P>
   Would having an ice skating rink on board do the trick? Or maybe
the opportunity to see three continents in one week without having
to pack a bag for each visit? . Or maybe to How about a chance to
set sail in pure luxury, or in casual comfort? . Maybe indulging
yourself in a spa that few land-based resorts can equal? Or do you
just need room to roam without that boxed-in feeling?.
</P>
<P>
   If you said ``yes'' to any one or more of those cruise ideas,
possibilities, then just maybe , this is could be your year to
discover what cruising. is about.
</P>
<P>
   Cruising has changed a lot in a very short time. And the ships
that are now sailing, along with some innovative ones heading to
sea this year, are a clear indication that the cruise industry is
out to change the way you think about taking to the seas.
</P>
<P>
   Just over 25 years ago when the modern-day cruise industry
began, about 500,000 people sailed yearly; , last year the number
was more than 6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even a few years ago, few people would have believed that a
cruise ship sailing in the Caribbean would have an ice skating rink
on board for both personal skating and shows. Or that the ship
would have a rock-climbing wall some 250 feet above the sea. Or an
in-line skating track.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Royal Caribbean's Voyager of the Seas introduced
all this, along with the largest casino at sea, a theater to rival
Broadway, entertainment and dining options galore, an indoor mall
(where one can dine, drink, be entertained, gamble, or shop),
Internet access at sea, and a lot more. You'd almost think you were
not on a ship. And that's just about what Royal Caribbean wants.
This ship takes dead aim at resorts such as the ones in Las Vegas.
Royal Caribbean is not out to take cruisegoers from competing lines
but to lure fresh sailors from land-based resorts and give them the
time of their life.
</P>
<P>
   A sister ship, the Explorer of the Seas, will join the Voyager
this fall. It will reportedly feature an ocean laboratory as well
as an ice skating rink.
</P>
<P>
   The Voyager is changing the way the industry views cruising.
Cunard, which has brought glamour to sailing for more than 100
years, is reportedly rethinking a new liner. While no firm plans
have been made, Cunard officials say the Queen Mary Project (the
working name given the new ship) will now be even larger than the
142,000-ton Voyager.
</P>
<P>
   With something for all, cruising is taking off as the vacation
of choice for millions of Americans. It provides the best of
travel, offering a break from the everyday world, new destinations
without packing each day, new experiences, along with a lot of
pampering. Many ships also provide on-board educational programs
ranging from archeologists discussing sights at ports of call to
learning to scuba dive.
</P>
<P>
   Ships are also catering to families, with huge centers for the
young set and separate teen-only areas.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, cruise vacations are packaged to include almost
everything from transportation to dining and entertainment. A few
lines are beginning to charge for extras such as rock climbing, ice
skating, or alternative dining, but even with those fees, cruising
is still one of the most affordable vacations.
</P>
<P>
   With time at a premium for many, a cruise can pack a lot into
seven days or less. The Royal Olympic Voyager packs a
three-continent experience into a week _ try that on your own.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, however, agrees with taking to the seas. Many
object to being on a large ship with up to 3,000 people, or dislike
regimented meal times and port calls. Some find a ship too
confining, and others have a fear of sickness. The new ships answer
most of these objections, being more spacious and having more
activities and entertainment choices, while offering a smoother
cruise through the use of stabilizers and new vibration-free
engines.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of years, more large ships have begun
offering staterooms with private balconies, providing a more
intimate space for relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some highly publicized incidents at sea have not
helped ease people's minds about taking a cruise. These include a
smoky fire off the coast of Florida, and reports about a ``cruise
to hell,'' as passengers described a voyage in which the ship lost
power in a storm and toilets backed up onto cabin floors. While
such occurrences are rare, and there were no reports of serious
injury, for many these are reasons enough to stay on shore.
</P>
<P>
   However, even these incidents and reports of crime appear not to
have deterred travelers from booking a cruise. Carnival, on whose
ships some of these incidents have occurred, has not seen its
bookings suffer. That line and others have added extra safety and
security measures.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these incidents, the industry is optimistic that some 10
million vacationers a year will soon be boarding ships, and cruise
lines are building new vessels at a record pace. A side benefit to
travelers is that discounts are being offered as cruise lines seek
passengers to fill new staterooms.
</P>
<P>
   Added lures are the new ships coming out this year.
</P>
<P>
   To mark the new century, Celebrity Cruises will bring on the
Millennium in June.The ship will be a marriage of the past and
future of cruising.
</P>
<P>
   The future will be found in such features as offering more than
80 percent of staterooms with ocean views _ 74 percent with
verandas _ along with what Celebrity is calling ``the largest and
most sophisticated spa at sea,'' and the first music library,
Notes, with thousands of selections of digital recordings and
individual listening stations. The Millennium will also be the
first ship to incorporate gas turbine technology, a propulsion
system that reduces exhaust by up to 90 percent, and considerably
curtails noise and vibration.
</P>
<P>
   Interior paneling from the R.M.S. Olympic, launched in 1911 and
sister ship to the Titanic, will represent the past. The paneling
will be placed along the interior of the Millennium's specialty
dining area. The paneling was discovered in a private English
residence and purchased through Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity has already made a name for itself in the culinary
field with individually prepared meals, all cooked from scratch and
supervised by the European master chef Michel Roux. To make dining
even more enticing, Richard Sasso, president of the line, said,
``The gourmet cuisine will be presented and finished tableside to
guests dining in this rare, nostalgic setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity has also made a name for itself in spa services. The
spa on the Millennium will be twice the size of those on other
Celebrity ships, and as the line says, it ``raises the concept of
the AquaSpa to an even greater level.'' The spa will offer a
variety of treatments, many focused on water. There will be a
10-meter pool just for AquaSpa bathers, along with a huge
Hydropool, which offers some eight types of water massage.
</P>
<P>
   Another ship debuting in June is Royal Olympic's Olympic
Voyager. While the vessel, at 25,000 tons, is just a fraction of
the size of the Voyager of the Seas, it will offer all the
amenities of a larger ship but in a more intimate atmosphere. What
sets this luxurious vessel apart is its speed. It will reportedly
be the fastest ship in the world, able to cruise at 27 knots.
</P>
<P>
   Presently being built in Hamburg, this 840-passenger
Greek-staffed vessel will be able to take passengers on a seven-day
voyage to three continents, visiting diverse and fascinating ports
in Greece, Turkey, Israel, and Egypt. On board will be specialists
presenting programs to give passengers the most from each port
experience.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are ships with sails. Star Clipper will introduce
the world's largest true sailing ship, the Royal Clipper, this
spring. The 439-foot, five-mast, fully-rigged vessel will offer one
of the largest deck areas for passengers, along with a water-sport
platform that can be lowered for use under the stern. Among luxury
touches will be 90 outside cabins, along with 14 whirlpool-equipped
Deck Suites, each with its own private veranda. The ship will
certainly outclass the vessel it is based on, the Preussen of the
Flying P Lines, which between 1902 and 1910 dominated both sail and
steam ships in the world's shipping lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Among other features will be a three-deck dining room seating
all passengers at one time. The atrium leading to the dining room
will have sunlight filtering from a glass-bottomed swimming pool.
Each of the five masts will have a lookout area part-way up, where
passengers will be able to order champagne sent up by a
block-and-tackle rig.
</P>
<P>
   The other Star Clipper vessels are based on designs from the
Clipper vessels _ the fastest in the world _ built in East Boston
in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Windjammer Barefoot Cruises, which offers casual sails in the
Caribbean, will also introduce a larger sailing vessel this year.
Sea Cloud Cruises, which offers a luxurious vessel designed as a
private yacht for Marjorie Meriweather Post, is building two
sailing vessels that will be in service this summer.
</P>
<P>
   American Cruise Lines will join small-vessel lines such as
American Canadian Caribbean Line, Clipper Cruises, and the Delta
Queen Steamboat Co. in featuring cruises along rivers, bays,
sounds, and canals. American Cruise Lines, based in Haddam, Conn.,
will introduce its first ship, the American Eagle, on a 14-day
cruise from Baltimore to Jacksonville, Fla. The line says its Eagle
will offer 29 large staterooms, all with picture windows and fine
dining.
</P>
<P>
   The Delta Queen Steamboat Co. will also introduce a new vessel,
the Columbia Queen, which will begin river cruising in the Pacific
Northwest. The 161-passenger vessel will sail on seven- and
eight-night cruises from Portland, Ore., along the Columbia, Snake,
and Willamette rivers. Passengers will be able to experience
private tastings at Washington wineries, travel through locks past
vast hydroelectric dams, and cruise to Lewiston, Idaho, where they
can take jet-boat rides through the soaring Hells Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Another new line this year will be United States Lines, a
subsidiary of American Classic Voyages, and the parent company of
Delta Queen Steamboat Co. and American Hawaii Cruises. The line's
first ship, the Patriot, will begin sailing on seven-day cruises
around Hawaii on Dec. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriot is currently sailing as the Holland America Line's
Nieuw Amsterdam and will be acquired in October, at which time
renovations will begin. Laws prevent ships flying foreign flags
from cruising only in American waters. When work is complete, the
Patriot will fly the US flag and employ a US crew as does the
present American Hawaii Cruises Independence. (The Independence was
built in Quincy, Mass., in the 1950s.) The line plans two new
ships, the first large ocean liners to be American built in more
than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Among other new ships arriving this year will be Holland
America's Zaandam and Amsterdam; Princess Cruises' Ocean Princess;
Costa Cruises' CostaAtlantica; American West Steamboat's Empress of
the North; the Carnival Victory and the Carnival Spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The key to enjoying a cruise is finding the right ship for your
personality and interests. This year there will be more choices
than ever, and one of these ships may just fit your vacation plans.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are some fun facts about the two Disney Cruise Line ships,
the Magic and the Wonder, which are structurally similar:
</P>
<P>
   --The Eiffel Tower is 986 feet high. The ships are each 964 feet
long.
</P>
<P>
   --If the Magic and Wonder were land vehicles, each would need an
eight-lane highway (median included) to handle their width.
</P>
<P>
   --It takes 20,000 gallons of paint to cover either ship. That's
enough to paint 2,000 average American homes.
</P>
<P>
   --Each ship can make a half-million gallons of fresh water every
day while cruising.
</P>
<P>
   --The 1,367 miles of cable on either ship are enough to run an
extension cord between Austin and Detroit. (But why would you want
to?)
</P>
<P>
   --Some 8,260 cups of coffee are served on board daily. Each ship
can carry a maximum of 2,400 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   --The anchor weighs 28,200 pounds _ roughly the weight of three
elephants.
</P>
<P>
   --On a three-day cruise, each ship will use 6,525 pool towels.

THE ENGADINE SHINES IN ANY WEATHER 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUIS A. DIIORIO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. MORITZ, Switzerland _ When the sun shines in the Engadine,
there is no more beautiful place on Earth. But when rain, thunder,
and lighting reign supreme, and when you find yourself knee deep in
unexpected snow . . . well, that's a different story.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino and La Nina continue to do a job on weather systems
around the globe, so when planning a holiday, whether it be at the
shore, in a city, or here in the mountains of eastern Switzerland,
have a Plan B . . . something to do when the weather goes awry.
</P>
<P>
   This past September, what had to be the remnants of Hurricane
Floyd left us soaked to the gills; and on Oct. 4 _ when the rain
ended in the wee hours _ we woke up to eight inches of snow. No
matter, one glorious day in the Engadine makes up for a week's
worth of the blahs!
</P>
<P>
   After the snowfall, the sun came out, melted what the locals
describe as ``Engadine gold,'' and for the next 14 days we enjoyed
what the tourist office calls its ``champagne climate'':
temperatures in the 50s and 60s, not a cloud to be seen, and a
royal blue sky that has to be seen to be believed.)
</P>
<P>
   Using the village of St. Moritz as our base for the past 16 or
17 years, we have explored eastern Switzerland and neighboring
Italy, mostly by foot, but also by train, bus, and car . . .
leaving early in the morning, taking cable cars and/or funiculars
to incredible heights, staying out till the cows come home.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, our Romansch-speaking friends have taken us down
paths too few tourists have seen. We've hiked from Martina (on the
Austrian border) along the River En to Castasegna (on the Italian
border), from St. Moritz over the Bernina Pass to Poschiavo and
then on to Tirano, a bustling Italian town in the Valtellina.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, the following travel suggestions will be of help to
you . . . weather or not. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Picturesque Soglio &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In and around St. Moritz, Pontresina, Zuoz, and Scuol (the major
ski areas), the locals prefer snow around Christmas and New Year's
and anytime after that through March. When we vacation here (in
September and October), any appreciable amount of snow sends us
daytripping.
</P>
<P>
   We're hikers, not skiers, and if we're staying at the higher
elevations (St. Moritz is at 5,400 feet), we usually take the bus
down the Maloja Pass with its hairpin turns to the Bergell (or
Bregaglia), the smallest of Graubunden's southern valleys.
Slate-roofed villages with great sounding names (Bondo,
Vicosoprano, Stampa, Spino, Borgonovo, Promotogno) dot the narrow
stretch that ends at Castasegna.
</P>
<P>
   We usually ride the bus to Casaccia at the foot of the pass and
walk the 14-mile valley floor (on the left side) . . . you can take
the scenic, historic, sunnier _ and more strenuous _ trail on the
right side to Soglio, one of the loveliest mountain villages in all
the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd rather ride than walk for five or six hours, take the
bus to Promontogno, where a smaller bus connects to Soglio.
</P>
<P>
   At 3,300 feet and often seen on Swissair posters, Soglio offers
several hikes, four or five places to stay, and one of
Switzerland's most dramatic views: across the Bergell and into Val
Bondasca with its jagged peaks where only the most expert of
climbers venture.
</P>
<P>
   Stay for lunch or dinner, or overnight at Palazzo Salis, built
in 1630 and converted into a guesthouse in 1876; or at Roland
Nass's newer and very comfortable Hotel/Restaurant La Soglina. Eat
out on the terrace . . . the flowers, birds, food, and panorama
combine to make it heaven on earth.
</P>
<P>
   End your Bergell stay with an easy downhill stroll through the
chestnut groves and under a waterfall to Castasegna. It's about an
hour to the bus stop. A reminder: Take plenty of film. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Palm Express &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've never been to the Ticino, Switzerland's
Italian-speaking canton, take the Palm Express, a 78-mile,
four-hour postal coach ride from the glaciers of St. Moritz to the
palm trees of Lugano. It's pasta, lemons, figs, grottos, merlot,
bocci, and festivals . . . truly a Mediterranean experience. This
is where Switzerland comes alive.
</P>
<P>
   The postal coach makes an espresso stop in Chiavenna (Italy);
hugs a narrow, winding two-lane road on the right side of Lake
Como; passes Dongo where deposed dictator Benito Mussolini was
captured and executed; stops again at the lakeside town of
Menaggio; and reenters Switzerland at Gandria on the outskirts of
Lugano.
</P>
<P>
   (An interesting sidetrip: Explore Menaggio, then walk along the
lake to Tremezzo and visit Villa Carlotta and its gardens before
taking a five-minute ferry ride to Bellagio, a resort town on a
spit in Lake Como. Good food, good shops, and good values now that
the dollar is more than 1,900 lira.)
</P>
<P>
   Charming and rustic Gandria can be reached by bus, boat, or
footpath from Lugano. Reminiscent of southern Italy, it is traffic
free and has many steps and crooked alleys, small courtyards, and
inviting restaurants, our favorite being Elda Pacchin's Locanda
Gandriese. On the opposite shore is the Cantina di Gandria, which
houses the Smugglers' Museum, and at the far end of the lake, the
picturesque Morcote is worthy of a day trip.
</P>
<P>
   The family-run Grotto Flora (closed on Mondays) in Bigogno
D'Agra, high above Lugano isn't the easiest place to find,
nevertheless, hire an experienced taxi driver and share an evening
with the locals. Few tables, tasty food cooked on a fireplace
grill, great ambience and don't be surprised if someone starts
playing a mandolin or guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Ascona and Locarno can be reached by train from Lugano . . .
change at Bellinzona where on Saturday mornings the canton capital
holds one of Switzerland's largest fairs.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you stay in Ascona or not, visit Castello del Sole. Once
a tiny inn, then a villa, and now a popular hostelry, the Castello
is open from early spring to late autumn and remains a Relais &AMP;
Chateaux showplace. Truly a must see.
</P>
<P>
   In Locarno, make time for a cappuccino at Caffe Al Porto on the
Viale Verbano side of the Mualto Hotel, then ride the funicular
high above the city to Madonna del Sasso, a church dating back to
the late 15th century. The view of the town and Lake Maggiore, and
of the paintings inside are what you'll remember most. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Riding the rails &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For lovers of trains, trips on the narrow-gauge Rhaetian Railway
are both endless and breathtaking. The most popular remains the
eight-hour Glacier Express from Zermatt to St. Moritz (or the
reverse direction) taking you over 291 bridges, breathtaking
viaducts, plunging gorges and through 91 tunnels. If you're into
railroading and engineering, this is the ride for you.
</P>
<P>
   Italians describe the ride on the Bernina Express as a journey
``dalle nevi eterne al gelato al limone'' (from glaciers to ice
cream and lemons). This picturesque and lively excursion originates
in Chur, the canton capital, makes its way to St. Moritz, and
climbs past the glaciers (on the right side) to Alp Grum at the top
of the Bernina Pass before beginning its descent to Poschiavo and
across the Italian border to Tirano. You can get off here or
transfer to a Swiss postbus for the final link of the journey along
the Valtellina's ``La Strada dei Vini'' to Lake Como and Lugano.
The ride to Tirano takes 4 1/2 hours from Chur.
</P>
<P>
   The Heidi Express, first operated in 1995, serves the resorts of
Klosters and Davos and like the Bernina Express makes possible a
day excursion to Tirano. The Engadine Express runs from St. Moritz
to Scuol where connecting buses take you to Innsbruck, and the
Arosa Express runs from Chur to the mountain resort of Arosa.

 ST. MORITZ, Switzerland: ... resort of Arosa.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The year-round Engadine Express begins in St. Moritz with a 1
1/2-hour train ride to Scuol. In Scuol you board a postbus to
Landeck, Austria, where you catch the train to Innsbruck, Salzburg,
and Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   For information about schedules and prices contact the Rhaetian

or surf out your information at www.rhb.ch.
</P>
<P>
   And in what should increase tourism in the Lower Engadine, the
Vereina, longest metre-gauge tunnel in the world, was opened in
November and has cut train travel from Zurich to Scuol from 5 1/2
to 2 1/2 hours. Traveling on the Engadin Star,'' the 19.1-kilometer
(roughly 12 miles) tunnel from Klosters to Susch has made it easier
for visitors to explore Scuol, a great hiking, skiing, and
white-water rafting center; and home to Bogn, the spa and health
center; the Swiss National Park; Lu, where its 70 inhabitants enjoy
what they describe as the sunniest village in Switzerland; and
Mustair, where in the 9th century Charlemagne built the Convent of
St. John that is still occupied by Benedictine Sisters. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Culturally speaking &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To become better acquainted with the region, the Engadine
Museum, a traditional Engadine house built in 1905 (closed on
Sundays) at Via dal Bagn 39, St. Moritz, provides a glimpse into
the lifestyle of eastern Switzerland's pioneers; while the nearby
and newly renovated Segantini Museum (closed on Mondays) at Via
Somplaz 30 is dedicated to the artist Giovanni Segantini, who spent
his last five years in the Engadine. His most significant work, the
large three-paneled ``Birth, Life and Death,'' is but one of many
of his paintings on display here, all part of a special exhibition
commemorating the 100th anniversary of his death.
</P>
<P>
   The rustic yet charming Mili Weber House, set back into the
woods at Via Dim Lej 35, contains her books, compositions, and
drawings. Her fairytale scenes adorn the walls and her postcards,
Christmas cards et al, on sale here, are sold all over Switzerland.
Admission is by appointment only. Phone 011 41 81 833 3860.
</P>
<P>
   Other museums you might find interesting are in Pontresina,
Scuol, Sils, Poschiavo, and Stampa. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Walking and learning &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss, who often combine outdoor education and exercise,
have added a third cultural trail to their list of things to do in
and around St. Moritz. Joining the Philosopher's Trail atop Muottas
Muragl and the Schellen Ursli Walk, just above St. Moritz, is The
Segantini Trail, a recently dedicated walking path with photographs
showing the artist at work, a brief biography, and reproductions of
several of his paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at the Hotel Soldanella, the trail follows the forest
path to the Segantini Museum and continues to the Suvretta region
(about a mile and a quarter).
</P>
<P>
   The Philosopher's Trail, combines quotations (on markers) from
Socrates to Sartre with views of Val Roseg and the Roseg glacier,
the sprawling town of Pontresina below, and a breathtaking panorama
of the Upper Engadine all the way to Maloja.
</P>
<P>
   The Ursli Walk starts in St. Moritz, passes the famous Heidi hut
and continues to Salastrains. It takes 45 minutes to walk the
mile-long route through the golden larchen forest.
</P>
<P>
   From St. Moritz, the well-kept footpaths along the lakes make it
easy for families to reach Val Fex, a soft and pleasant valley
where farmers bring their cows in the summer and where philosopher
Frederich Nietzsche, who lived in nearby Sils Maria from 1881 to
1888, wrote and wandered. Both Fex and Val Roseg (near Pontresina)
can be enjoyed either by foot or horse-drawn carriage.
</P>
<P>
   What has become our favorite walk, and one we look forward to
each year, is the trek from the S-chanf rail station, up and
through the forest to the peaceful 16th-century hamlet of Susauna.
It has but nine houses, one built in 1514; a youth hostel; and a
church nestled in a quiet little valley next to the Vallember
stream, and like Val Fex, it grows on you.
</P>
<P>
   The path continues on to the Hotel Veduta (for lunch) opposite
the Cinuos-chel station. The national park and the end of the
Engadine ski marathon are nearby. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Have book, will travel &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the weather, take along a book bag, but if you do run
out of reading material, there are libraries at Sils-Besaglia (near
the Hotel Margna and next to the bus stop) and at Plazza da Scuola
(telephone: 834-4000 or 02). The new St. Moritz library has more
than 6,000 books (some in English), and a wide selection of musical
cassettes, CDs, maps, newspapers, and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're here on the second Sunday in March, one of the
great takes is The Engadine Cross-Country Ski Marathon. First
staged in 1969, it attracts more than 13,000 skiers who are put to
the test over 42 kilometers (26 miles) from Maloja to an area near
S-chanf, where there is a new train stop used only on marathon day.
</P>
<P>
   If the weather forces you indoors, make use of the giant-size
public indoor swimming pool in St. Moritz Bad, its neighboring spa,
the casino, movie theaters, and skating rinks in St. Moritz,
Pontresina, Davos, Chur, and Arosa. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cycling to Venice &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One last suggestion:
</P>
<P>
   Cyclists looking for something more adventurous than daylong
jaunts along the River Inn, can sign up for a 14-day trek from St.
Moritz to Venice.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Eurotrek in Zurich, the journey follows the popular
Inn Cycle Path through quaint Engadine villages, along the Swiss
National Park to Martina, and then by bus through the
Reschenpass/Passo di Resia in Italy. From there, it's downhill to
Merano and Bolzano (seven days). In the second week, the path takes
you through Trento, Lake Garda, Verona, Vicenza, and Abano
Terme/Padua to Venice.
</P>
<P>
   The package includes the rental of 21-gear bikes, overnight
stays, and transportation. For additional details contact
Eurotrek/Eventure AG, Vulkanstrasse 116, Postfach, 8048 Zurich

WHY NOT HARVARD? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If ever there was a failure to see the forest for the trees, it
is the ongoing search of an entity which might nurse Harvard
Pilgrim Health Care back to commercial good health. Thirteen
potential suitors have expressed a concrete interest.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that some sort of entity is needed to put up a
lot of cash so Harvard Pilgrim can pay its bills. The argument has
to do with who or what sort of would-be angel might be suitable.
</P>
<P>
   A for-profit company from some other part of the country? A
taxpayer bailout by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts? A bust-up
and sale of assets?
</P>
<P>
   Here's an alternative that's been making the rounds in health
care circles _ one that isn't on the table yet.
</P>
<P>
   How about the institution whose name is on the door? How about
Harvard University?
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, why doesn't Harvard put up some form of guarantee
_ $500 million or even $1 billion _ as collateral, to serve as a
kind of emergency bandage for a very serious wound.
</P>
<P>
   That would permit the recapitalization of Harvard Pilgrim's
debt, which is estimated to be $300 million and could go much
higher high during the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   The money would come from Harvard's $14.4 billion endowment. It
wouldn't be spent at all, as long as the reorganization were
successful. It simply would serve as a cushion of financial
stability on which the HMO could continue to operate for a few
years _ much like government guarantees permitted Chrysler Corp.
survive in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   With so much money at risk, the university could then be
expected to shoulder a good deal of the responsibility for putting
the ailing health plan back on its feet.
</P>
<P>
   It could help negotiate some form of debt reduction _ a
``haircut,' as it is known _ for its hospitals, which are among the
largest creditors of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, it could participate in building professional
management for the plan. One possibility would be to hire an
outside turnaround firm to assist chief executive Charles D. Baker
Jr. bring Harvard Pilgrim's procedures into competitive trim.
Another would be to contract for management of the plan with one of
the HMO's known to be bidding for Harvard Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   Whence derives Harvard University's responsibility? It is not
simply the that the world's richest university has deep pockets.
With the best of intentions, Harvard University helped create the
plan that has become the problem, oversaw it for more than a
quarter century, then accepted a handshake dismissal when things
started to get dicey in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1969 that Harvard Medical School dean Robert Ebert won
permission to start Harvard Community Health Plan, an East Coast
version of an experiment that earlier had taken root in California.
The idea was to change the incentives to doctors and patients
alike, and cut insurance companies out of the middle in the
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Those were days when Medicare was altering rapidly the economics
of hospital care, paying artificially high rates to hospitals for
each patient day to gain acceptance. The hospitals prospered, but
so did the HMOs, which were percieved as being an alternative to an
automatic hospital stay. Operating five teaching hospitals in
Boston, Harvard was well aware of the dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Harvard was deeply involved in the governance of the
plan until just four years ago. The HCHP Corporation _ a
twelve-person board which met once a year _ was dominated by
Harvard luminaries, Derek Bok, Francis Burr, Maurice Lazarus and
Henry Meadow among them. It was was organized out of existence in
1996, as part of the merger with Pilgrim Health Care.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard has just finished an extensive capital campaign.
Wouldn't the alumni complain? Perhaps. But wouldn't financing a
bailout for a time _ at no substantial cost to the endowment _ be
better than investing in a racetrack at the center of a criminal
probe, as The Boston Globe'e Michael Rezendes reported Monday?
</P>
<P>
   Such stepping up to the plate has even been done before. When
Harvard doctors faced a malpractice crisis a decade ago, the
university used the endowment to underwrite a captive offshore
insurance firm for them.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the stakeholders in the troubled HMO, Harvard University
is the biggest. It fathered the plan. Its name is on the door. It
is time to take responsibility.

GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF OIL'S UPS AND DOWNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oil prices are as high as they have been since the Gulf War.
Gasoline prices are high; so are home heating oil prices. And like
Dr. Evil, the villain from Austin Powers, the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries seems to have returned from the past
to make life miserable for all of us.
</P>
<P>
   FedEx has announced a fuel surcharge of 3 percent on all
deliveries. A few days ago, all the major airlines added a 3
percent fuel surcharge on international flights.
</P>
<P>
   What's causing the run-up? How long will it last? To get some
answers, we turned to Joseph Stanislaw, president of Cambridge
Energy Research Associates, an international consulting firm with
offices in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Stanislaw has been following the ups and downs of oil since
1975. In 1998 he and Daniel Yergin wrote ``The Commanding
Heights,'' a book about the triumph of markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Wasn't it only a year ago we were talking about $10-a-barrel
oil?
</P>
<P>
   A. That's right. The story really begins in November 1997. OPEC
had a meeting in Indonesia at the height of the Asian crisis. OPEC
agreed to increase production. Right after that, Asian demand went
into a complete freefall and bang, you had too much oil.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And that drove the price way down.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. By early 1999 you had too much inventory and for some
producers the price was heading down below $10 a barrel. The
producers were looking at death in the face. Saudi Arabia's budget
deficit grew dramatically and countries like Iran, Venezuela and
Mexico were in desperate financial situations. They all needed
higher prices and the only way to get it was to cut back on the
amount of oil they were producing.
</P>
<P>
   Q. OPEC has talked about cutting back production before, but
this time around they actually did it. What was different this
time?
</P>
<P>
   A. What is rare about this event is that they did what they said
they would do. The reality was they were facing financial ruin.
When you have no money and severe social problems, it is like
seeing the whites of the eyes of the enemy. In this case, it
galvanized OPEC and allowed them to speak with a common voice.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So there is less oil being produced and the world economy has
bounced back. Does anything else explain the run-up in prices?
</P>
<P>
   A. Look out the window. We've had a tremendously abnormal cold
streak in the US and Europe, which has increased demand for oil.
The fact that it has coincided with everything else is just bad
luck.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Couldn't OPEC just produce a little more to bring the prices
down?
</P>
<P>
   A. OPEC faces a problem that everyone in the commodity business
faces: If you produce a barrel too little, the prices spike. But if
you produce a barrel too much, the price comes sliding down. There
is no pure relationship between the amount you produce and the
price level. The upshot is you can't fine-tune the price. There
can't be an Alan Greenspan for the oil market. It is never going to
be in perfect balance.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you think OPEC's goal is to push the price as high as
possible?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think their intention is to starve the oil market or
starve the world economy. The producers know they cannot be too
greedy. They don't mind making a little more money. None of them
do. But if they push the price too high market forces will
undermine them, which is what happened in the 1980s. High prices
can work for a while but not for long. The producers recognize
that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So where do we go from here?
</P>
<P>
   A. If OPEC waits until the end of the second quarter to increase
production, I wouldn't expect prices to drift down much from where
they are now. If, on the other hand, they boost production sometime
between March and May, you could see prices weaken in the second
half of the year. They could go from about $28 a barrel down to $25
a barrel or maybe even lower. (Oil prices have averaged about $18 a
barrel over the last decade).
</P>
<P>
   Q. So this shouldn't be a disaster?
</P>
<P>
   A. It would only be a disaster if OPEC kept production where it
is now for another six to nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you surprised there has not been more kicking and
screaming about the high oil prices?
</P>
<P>
   A. Oil's impact on the US economy is about one-third of what it
was in the 1970s. We have power plants that burn multiple fuels. We
have a much bigger economy that is less energy-intensive. You are
typing on a personal computer. You don't need much energy to do
that.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mary Farrell could not have chosen a more
propitious time to deliver a prognosis of onward and upward markets
to a group of PaineWebber clients: It was the eve of the 107th
month of economic expansion in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There has never been a run this long, the PaineWebber managing
director said, so it is legitimate to ask if it can go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not prepared to say we will never see another recession _
certainly one is inevitable _ but we don't see one looking
forward,'' said Farrell, a senior market strategist best known as a
regular on PBS's ``Wall $treet Week with Louis Rukeyser.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy also is at the beginning stages of what Farrell
characterized as ``the largest wealth transfer in history,'' to
occur over the next few decades, as baby boomers will be receiving
inheritances and, over time, entering retirement ``in far better
financial shape than prior generations.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an era PaineWebber calls ``The American Age of
Affluence,'' Farrell said. That is not to be interpreted as a time
of giddy trading amid the glee. Farrell advocates prudent investing
at a time when people are pumping money into frenetic technology
stocks: Pay a little more for stock in quality and well-established
companies and hold it for the long term.
</P>
<P>
   This philosophy is the antithesis of day traders. ``They have
greatly contributed to the volatility in the market and created an
atmosphere of trading rather than investing,'' Farrell said, ``and
I think they are a very destabilizing force in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   She warned that day traders ``have had the wind at their backs
in a bull market'' and predicted that only 20 percent of them are
making money.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks in particular have contributed to market
volatility, and Farrell noted that the mania for stocks that are
even remotely Internet-related is not unprecedented. There have
been manias for other ``new technology'' companies with investors
bidding up the stock prices of even the most speculative operation,
and they have not ended happily for the investors, Farrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, an index of the 24 leading computer companies
at their 1983 highs and note that they corrected by a full 50
percent in February 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the early winners? Everybody wanted to own a
Commodore, a Tandy and a Wang. Now they are collector items in the
garage, collecting dust. The big winners either did not exist or
were not publicly held companies _ Compaq, Dell and Gateway,''
Farrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell, a graduate of New York University who serves on the
board of overseers of the university's Stern School of Business,
also is the author of ``Beyond the Basics: How to Invest Young
Money, Now That You Know a Thing or Two,'' published by Simon &AMP;
Schuster, which will be available in April.

SINTRA: `PLAYGROUND FOR KINGS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINTRA, Portugal _ Diogo looked toward the mountains and happily
found they hadn't vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``All clear,'' he pronounced, ``so today we go to Sintra. It's a
wonderful drive, a wonderful place, a playground for kings. But too
often clouds conceal the mountains and block the sun. You don't
want to go there on a day like that.''
</P>
<P>
   We were lolling above the sea at Cascais where the fuming
Atlantic hammers the cliffs into jagged, intricate shapes, and
intrepid fishermen use ladders and climbing skills to get down
close enough to cast their lines from long poles. The place is
called Mouth of the Inferno, and watching fishermen cautiously
grope for working position is a spectator sport. A triumphant catch
of a large cod by a precariously perched angler will draw applause
from safely stationed onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water is very cold,'' says a fisherman named Rodrigo,
well-splattered by the bashing waves, ``but that's good. The colder
the water, the tastier the fish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to eat some very good fish for lunch in Sintra,
about 30 miles to the northwest,'' promises Diogo Cabral, a
Portuguese friend, as he loaded us into his van. ``They must come
from water chillier than I want to swim in.''
</P>
<P>
   Guincho Beach, at the foot of the Sintra Range, is disorderly.
Sandy loads from its dunes have been pushed across the road by a
fierce wind that has also whipped up the surf.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a windsurfing paradise,'' says Diogo, ``but not so
good for a van trying to get through these waves of sand, a natural
roadblock.''
</P>
<P>
   But in low gear he conquers the drifts and begins the climb away
from the sea into the low range's thick, dark forests where trees
fight for space with rocks and boulders. First stop is Cabo da
Roca, the westernmost tip of Europe, and the last look at their
country for those bold Portuguese seafarers _ world-circling Vasco
de Gama _ setting off on their 15th-century voyages of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic makes a reappearance 600 feet below the redheaded
lighthouse that crowns the lonely and barren jutting bluff. But at
that distance a rabid surf seems a lacy collar on an olive gown.
</P>
<P>
   Down and up the road jiggles and jogs, sometimes walled by
fields of sugar cane, sometimes by stone barriers blanketed by
wisteria and shielding elegant summer homes. One of those, the
18th-century Palacio de Seteais (the ``palace of seven sighs'') has
become a magnificent hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The handsomely hedged gardens, with lanes of lemon and camelia
trees and coverlets of climbing wisteria, does provoke sighs of
delight. Perhaps the hotel bill causes other sorts. An archway
marks the stopover of Portuguese Queen Dona Maria in 1802. If she
sighed about bills of any kind it isn't reported in the
inscription.
</P>
<P>
   Landmarks immediately signaling the entry to Sintra are the twin
kitchen smokestacks of the Palacio Nacional (the royal palace), as
imposing as atomic reactors. Sintra, on the other side of the
range, is a town of palaces, castles, and manors, a summertime
getaway from Lisbon for titled types of an earlier day.
</P>
<P>
   Poets such as the hedonistic Lord Byron in 1809 rhapsodized
about the atmosphere of ease and beauty. It gets a call in his
``Childe Harold'' _ ``Lo! Sintra's glorious Eden intervenes in
variegated maze of mount and glen.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord Byron, of course, sighed muchly about the ladies, as did an
occupant of the ivory-toned Palacio Nacional, a blend of Moorish
and Gothic design. That was His Highness Joao I, the kissy king.
His name comes up when you inspect the ornate Sala das Pegas, an
ornithologically decorated room with 100 of those thieving birds,
magpies, strutting across the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   The local story is that whenever Queen Philippa detected or
heard of her Joao stealing a kiss from a lady in waiting, she had
another magpie painted overhead. Reminders of his naughtiness. But,
of course, he would deny, protesting the innocence of it all with,
``Por bem'' (``It's all for the good''). Since each magpie bears
the label ``Por bem,'' it seems the king employed a painter, too,
and apparently did get in his side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   A nearby room, festooned similarly with swans, makes my friend,
Aurelio, suspicious. ``If a little magpie represents an indiscreet
kiss,'' she says, ``do swans speak of a bigger game?''
</P>
<P>
   Diogo smiles and says, ``Oh, let's just say that King Joao was a
bird-of-any-feather fancier.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt an odd bird was the roommate of another queen, Maria
II. Her husband, the German Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha,
didn't hide his sin _ of an architectural nature. For a century and
a half it has giggled down at Sintra in the slapstick form of the
Castelo da Pena. Occupying a mountain pinnacle, it's the peak of
castleian buffoonery, a grafting of styles: Disney onto Ludwig the
Mad King of Bavaria; a laugh-breed.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Ferdinand must have told his architect, a compatriot, a
Baron von Eschwege, to give him a castle that has everything. And
he got it: onion and varied other domes, medieval keep, turrets,
crenellated towers, gargoyles, low embrasures, archers' slits,
frizzy Manueline windows, minarets. And more, including bas reliefs
of his heroes, Atlas, Neptune, and Bacchus.
</P>
<P>
   The prince had to settle for a plain wooden toilet chair, but
King Carlos I updated the bathroom in 1900 with tiled toilet,
shower, bidet, and (maybe a Freudian convenience?) a couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we didn't see this place on a full stomach,'' says
Aurelio. ``Is it time for lunch?'' A bonging clock tower down in
the plaza, well below the castle, says yes.
</P>
<P>
   Diogo makes a good selection, the terrace of the Hockey Caffe,
shaded by pines, across the plaza from the Palacio Nacional.
Hockey? A cheerful waiter, Artur Boaventura, admits he's never seen
ice beyond a glass, and cannot identify Raymond Bourque or Wayne
Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play the game on roller skates with a tennis ball,'' he
says, ``and this cafe has a team. We're pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Better than pretty good are the fish, well-beloved cod, he shows
us on a platter before they are tastily grilled. We've had cod in
one way or another every day. Mostly as bacalao (salted) and
constantly, deliciously different in preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know your Boston is called the home of the bean and the
cod,'' says Diogo, ``but, with no offense, I would stake our cod
against your cod.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Por bem,'' says Aurelio, smiling. ``All for the good. A
seafood fight. And, by cod, may the better fish win _ a place in
the pot and our hearts.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Keeping up with CNET Inc. is full-time work.
Since the company went public in 1996, it has merged, partnered and
aligned itself more often than Liz Taylor. Its portfolio has grown
to include eight Web sites and five television programs.
</P>
<P>
   CNET's work force grew by 180 people last year, bringing total
employment to 670. Its stock rose by 324 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, CNET has been on a tear. The company
bought comparison shopping site MySimon.com for $700 million. It
launched a 24-hour tech news radio station in the San Francisco
area. And Monday the company announced it would form a
news-gathering partnership with the Associated Press, the nation's
largest news service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really what our strategy was coming into this year, to
further evolve the company into different areas,'' said CNET
President Richard J. Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the activity, it is easy to lose track of what
CNET's core business is. First and foremost, the company provides
technology consumers with information, a Consumer Reports magazine
for tech gear.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, the company has a crew of news writers and reviewers
looking at companies and products. It distributes that information
through a variety of media outlets, including its Web site
(www.cnet.com), its news site (www.news.com), its San Francisco
radio station (910 AM) and a number of cable TV shows it produces.
</P>
<P>
   The company's latest announcement, an agreement to share
technology news with the AP, signals an important benchmark for the
7-year-old company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It validates the news-gathering prowess of CNET,'' said media
analyst David Cole, founder of the Cole Group in Walnut Creek.
``There are a lot of former daily journalists, mostly from print,
working there. This is the first time AP has put its imprimatur on
news gathered for the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   AP Business Editor Randy Picht said the deal sets a precedent
for the AP, which is a news-gathering cooperative dating from 1848.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we have formed a partnership with an
on-line news service,'' Picht said from New York. ``News.com is not
that old, and this kind of deal shows that on-line news has come a
long way, and it's here to stay. When we were looking at their
copy, we were impressed.''

AN INTRIGUING THEORY ON JESUS' DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
JESUS OF NAZARETH, KING OF THE JEWS 
A Jewish Life and the Emergence of Christianity 
By Paula Fredriksen 
Knopf, 327 pp., illustrated, $26 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like no other figure in Western history, he provokes arguments
that probably have no resolution because there is no indisputable
evidence upon which to build a case. And nearly 2,000 years after
he died, Jesus is still a lightning rod for contentious
reinterpretation. This is understandable _ the hunger to know the
man who gave birth to a religion that shaped the modern world will
likely never be sated.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Fredriksen, a respected biblical scholar at Boston
University, offers up her own captivating, plausible, but surely
controversial interpretation of Jesus, and particularly of his
death, in ``Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.'' There are
moments when her writing is ponderous, even inscrutable. But
Fredriksen boldly and compellingly tackles a fundamental question
about Jesus: Why did he die? For it was ultimately his death, and
the ensuing resurrection proclaimed by his disciples, that fueled
the nascent movement that would evolve and coalesce into
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Fredriksen is hampered by the same obstacles that all Jesus
scholars face: the dearth of any significant contemporary
information about Jesus's life and death. The Gospel accounts were
written well after his crucifixion, and with obvious proselytizing
aims in mind; on crucial questions, they leave scholars unable to
settle factual questions with any certainty. But by skillfully
weaving together the narratives of the four Gospels as well as
information from the Dead Sea Scrolls, from Jewish authorities of
Jesus's era, and from early rabbinic authorities, Fredriksen
constructs a reasonable (if not conclusive) theory of Jesus's death
that departs dramatically from tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Fredriksen is at pains to present Jesus in the historical,
social, and religious context of his times. And though at times she
risks being tedious in her analysis and layering of details, at the
end you realize how much her method served her ultimate intent _
seeking to determine why Jesus was killed as a political insurgent,
but his followers were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though the unique starting point of a new religious movement,
Jesus would not have been Jesus without all the others standing
around him and after him: his followers, his antagonists, pilgrims
to and residents of Jerusalem, the Romans, Jews in the Diaspora,
and, eventually, Gentiles,'' Fredriksen writes. ``We cannot explain
and understand him without likewise explaining and understanding
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fredriksen's paramount interest is presenting Jesus as ``a
prophet who preached the coming apocalyptic Kingdom of God,'' the
Jesus we most clearly encounter in John's Gospel. ``This Jesus . .
. is not primarily a social reformer with a revolutionary
message,'' Fredriksen argues. ``Nor is he a religious innovator
radically redefining the traditional ideas and practices of his
native religion. His urgent message had not the present so much as
the near future in view.'' Particularly by emphasizing Jesus's
Jewishness, Fredriksen lays the groundwork for her conclusion that
he was ordered killed by Pilate not because of any threat he
represented, but out of fear of the danger his supporters posed.
</P>
<P>
   Giving greater credence to John's Gospel, Fredriksen believes
Pilate was familiar with Jesus because Jesus had come to Jerusalem
several times _ a far different scenario from that in the synoptic
Gospels, which trace their narrative from Jesus's origin to a
single triumphant, then fatal entrance into the holy city. In
Fredriksen's view, because Pilate knew about Jesus and his
preaching from previous visits, the Roman did not consider him
particularly menacing. If he had, Pilate would have done something
about it far earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Fredriksen strives to make a credible case that Jesus's
arrest and crucifixion were triggered by the way he was jubilantly
received as the messiah when he entered Jerusualem for Passover.
``Jesus himself is not dangerous,'' Fredriksen notes. ``But for the
first time, this Passover, the crowds who swarm around him are. . .
. The excitement of the crowds around Jesus that Passover might
easily have spilled over into riot. Killing Jesus publicly, by
crucifixion, would go a long way toward disabusing the crowd. Let
him hang indicted by their own belief: King of the Jews. A nice
touch _ an insult to the idea itself as well as to their
convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   But killing Jesus, of course, was the beginning and not the end
of his movement. It allowed his disciples to declare his
resurrection _ the fulfillment of the prophesied coming of the
Kingdom of God, and the spark that allowed for the spread of the
movement. ``Their experience of his resurrection confirmed for them
both Jesus's own authority and the authority of his message,''
Fredriksen notes. And it was the ``authority of his message'' that
gave birth to a new church.

THE FANTASTICAL FUTURE OF TV
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: With FUTURE-TV-WEB-SITES) 
 
 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What we've called television for the past 50 years is undergoing
radical changes at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television as we know it will be gone in 15 years,'' says Jim
Chabin, president of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.
Remember the talk a few years back of a 500-channel universe?
Though we're not quite there yet, we're already talking 500,000
channels. And the speed at which technology is moving is likely to
make that happen sooner than later.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is technology altering the types of programming we'll
be seeing but the way we watch television, too. Once called the
boob tube, TV is becoming increasingly interactive and
computerlike.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few signs the future is almost here:
</P>
<P>
   _ In the past year, AT&AMP;T bought two of the world's largest cable
companies, Microsoft bought a chunk of AT&AMP;T, and this month America
Online made a deal to merge with Time Warner with its cable and
broadcast networks, No. 2 cable system and music, movie and TV
studios. And you can count on more major corporate marriages like
these, as other big players try to position themselves for a new
entertainment world order. This competition is likely to spur
changes as these new companies try to roll out their technologies
first.
</P>
<P>
   _ A variety of new devices are smearing boundaries between TV,
the Internet and other media, including sophisticated new digital
cable set-top boxes, WebTV Plus, the Replay and TIVO personal video
recorders, computer peripherals such as ATI's All-in-Wonder 128
graphics card and videogame consoles like the forthcoming
PlayStation 2.
</P>
<P>
   _ For the first time this fall, viewers could more actively take
part in some of the shows they love, as with enhanced versions of
``Jeopardy'' and ``Wheel of Fortune,'' thanks to interactive
technology developed by a Los Angeles company called Mixed Signals.
Again, owners of WebTV Plus machines and other set-top boxes can
use their remote to play along, as information transmitted in the
closed-caption part of the TV signal is used to key action on the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   _ ABC TV regularly touted on air the interactive aspects of its
``Monday Night Football'' telecasts. Tonight's broadcast of the
Super Bowl on ABC will feature the same enhanced TV offerings of
the network's Monday Night Football, including a pick-the-play game
synchronized to the second with the broadcast. The ABC, NFL and
ESPN Web sites will also include such features as a ``momentum
meter'' that tracks emotional shifts in the game's progress.
</P>
<P>
   Both before and after the game, the sites will feature chats
with sports figures, scouting guides, and analysis and statistics,
among other information.
</P>
<P>
   _ MTV game show ``WebRIOT'' also requires its viewers to log on
to the MTV.com Web site with their computer while watching the show
if they want to play along. But 44,000 people a day are doing so.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Dish Network's new Dish Player takes the idea further,
combining a satellite TV receiver, personal video recording
services and WebTV Plus. TIVO and Philips are creating a similar
device for the leading satellite service, DirecTV.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the computer world, peripheral companies are doing their
own boundary pushing. ATI's All-In-Wonder 128 graphics card, for
instance, gives a computer such capabilities as HDTV tuning,
replay-like video recording, video editing and the ability to play
DVDs and audio CDs, even karaoke titles in the Video CD format.
</P>
<P>
   And what's driving all this? Money, of course. There's a ton of
it to be made, making it easy to buy what you see on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   RespondTV made a splash last year with an experiment selling
pizza to Bay Area WebTV Plus users watching a ``Star Trek''
marathon. The WebTV Plus, a $199 box sold by Sony and Philips based
around a Microsoft service, provides a simple Internet connection
through the television.
</P>
<P>
   RespondTV's behind-the-scenes software let WebTV viewers use the
box's remote control and wireless keyboard to order a pizza without
even leaving their couch to get the cordless phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 250 people clicked on the ad, and 150 people bought a
pizza, out of maybe 1,000 who could actually see the ad,'' said
RespondTV President Richard Fisher. Advertisers love numbers like
those, and will pay big to get similar results, said Josh Bernoff,
Forrester Research principal analyst, who predicts that by 2004,
there will be 24 million U.S. households able to interact with
their TVs.
</P>
<P>
   And in the future, such impulse buys will be even easier,
because the digital cable set-top boxes now being put in homes
around America will already know the buyer's address and billing
information, Fisher said. Buying will be as easy as changing
channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct marketing is a $160 billion industry that TV doesn't
participate in any appreciable way,'' Fisher said. Soon it will.
</P>
<P>
   Even devices long considered as little brothers to the TV set,
videogame consoles, are getting smarter and more powerful. Sony's
PlayStation 2 comes to the United States this fall with a DVD
player, leading-edge computer chips and high-speed peripheral
connections that can turn it into a home entertainment and Internet
center.
</P>
<P>
   Sony has also promised to create a high-speed broadband service
in 2001 so PlayStation 2 owners can attach hard drives and fast
modems to their machines and download movies and music.
</P>
<P>
   You can already watch, rent, even buy digital movies on the
Internet, though much needs to be done to make it as easy as
turning on a TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it is possible to watch video on the PC, it's
uncomfortable,'' Bernoff said. ``Computers are not typically set up
right to make that easy. So most of what you see right now with
video on PCs is a dress rehearsal.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Sightsound.com was the first to offer a downloadable,
feature-length movie for sale or rent, the independent sci-fi flick
``Pi.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We only had it up for 3 1/2 weeks,'' said company co-founder
Scott Sander. ``And about half the sales were to strategic sales
people at the studios. It wasn't a business yet, it was an
expedition, but we learned a lot in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of other companies are joining Sightsound online, some
buying movies and other programs, and others creating original
shows, said Mariana Danelovic, senior manager of the digital media
business incubator for KPMG Peat Marwick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think within the next couple of years there's going to be
more and more programming on the Web that's going to be TV-like,''
Danelovic said. ``I don't believe that mass-broadcast events are
the way to use the Internet effectively. What we've developed are
the niche media networks.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Entertaindom.com, a Warner Bros. entertainment site in
Burbank, scored a notable success with its much-downloaded animated
short, ``The Peeper,'' created by hot comedian Adam Sandler. Other
big-name performers are also coming to the Web, such as comedian
Robin Williams and musical entrepreneur Sean ``Puffy'' Combs, which
will only increase viewer interest in Web-based programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Internet is going to be the new place for
entertainment,'' said Mediatrip.com president Robert Faust.
Mediatrip had its own Net hit this fall with ``George Lucas in
Love,'' a short spoof that Faust said drew 150,000 viewings in
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are big numbers for a company that's not doing much
marketing right now,'' said Faust. For comparison, a decently rated
cable show will have around 1.5 million households watching at any
given moment.
</P>
<P>
   If all this sounds dizzying, listen to Robert Hopkins, senior
vice president and general manager of Sony's High-Definition Data
Center and one of the authors of the U.S. HDTV technical
specifications. ``If you can't do it now, just wait a couple of
years. We'll be delivering video one way or another into the home.
I believe things like the home theater are going to be even more
important than they are now.''

AFRICAN FILMS SHED `TARZAN' IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edgar Rice Burroughs never set foot in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   This little factoid wouldn't be all that significant except that
Burroughs, a hack pulp writer, largely molded the public's image of
the continent and its people through his two dozen ``Tarzan''
novels _ and countless ``Tarzan'' films from those starring Johnny
Weissmuller to last year's animated Disney version. Nearly a
century since he first wrote of his ``white ape'' among the
``jabbering'' savages, Burroughs's myopic view of Africa remains
sadly prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what makes ``African Cinema 2000'' such an
important and worthy event. The Boston Museum of Fine Arts
festival, which begins Thursday, features eight films from eight
African countries that shake misconceptions about the continent,
while highlighting the challenges and realities facing Africa
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm personally very excited about African filmmaking, and I've
been showing it for 20 years of programming,'' said Bo Smith, who
heads the MFA's film program. ``I think we have a particularly
strong collection of films which range from an attractive
audience-pleasing comedy like `Pieces d'identities,' to dramatic
films and documentaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Mweze Ngangura's ``Pieces d'identities,'' which opens the
festival, tells the story of a village king who travels to Belgium
to find his daughter who left home years before to study medicine.
The Congolese film considers the struggles between older Africans
intent on holding onto Africa's traditions _ even in Belgium, the
king continues to wear his royal fetishes _ and young Africans
embracing Western modernism away from their homeland. Though his
film is a comedy, Ngangura gently explores such serious topics as
racism and cultural pride and identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The filmmaker said one of the reasons he made the film was
because he was living in Europe, and he was interested what happens
to people who emigrate from Africa to Europe,'' said Cornelius
Moore, co-director of California Newsreel, a San Francisco
nonprofit dedicated to making African films accessible to American
audiences. The group helped the MFA organize African Cinema 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was interested in their view of themselves, their
relationship with the home country, and especially their kids
growing up in a country which may or may not want them,'' Moore
said. ``He made this film to speak to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Identity _ sexual, not racial _ is examined in ``Woubi Cheri''
from the Ivory Coast. Documentarians Philip Brooks and Laurent
Bocahut introduce a community of woubis and yossis, gay and
bisexual men, respectively, seeking love and happiness in a
controus (homophobic) society. It is a story of survival and
perseverance (there's even an Ivory Coast Transvestites
Association), and a rare look at an African gay community.
</P>
<P>
   Other films include Mickey Madoba Dube's ``A Walk in the Night''
from South Africa; Ingrid Sinclair's ``Flame'' from Zimbabwe;
``Genesis'' by Cheick Oumar Sissoko of Mali; ``Jean-Marie Teno's
``Chief,'' from Cameroon; Francisco Manso's ``Testamento'' from
Cape Verde; and Flora Gomes's ``Mortu Nega'' from Guinea-Bissau.
The festival runs through Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
   While the films do not shy away from some of Africa's problems _
both ``Flame'' and ``Mortu Nega'' look at aspects of two wars for
liberation _ they consider Africans as more than just victims of
famine or civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Film has such a powerful impact in shaping people's
perceptions, that it's the responsibility of an exhibitor to
present the most accurate and honest images which allow for the
best understanding,'' Smith said. ``So much of what we see and what
we know of the world and history is based on what we've learned
through film.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can trace back just a few years ago when there were these
newsreels where you were relying on an outsider who really had very
little knowledge of the culture, and was just taking shots very
much from a perspective of an exotic tourist fascinated by the
foreignness,'' he said. ``They weren't appreciative of the culture
and the priorities of the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes this festival's films special is that, for the most
part, it's Africans making the films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the thing that has always interested me in African
filmmaking is that it was able to stand apart from other world
cinemas by having its own unique perspective,'' Smith said. ``In
other commercial cinemas, you see a lot of formulaic cinema where
one type of filmmaking becomes the accepted practice for everybody
_ which makes for a lot of boring films.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you're outside of an established commercial
production, you're able to do things in much more of an original
fashion. And that's what has happened in Africa. Those who make
films are really brave and courageous people who have done it on
their own.''

EXPLORE TV'S FUTURE TODAY ON THE WEB

<P>
   Here's a quick list of places to go to look for video content on
the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   _ Yack.com (www.yack.com): It styles itself as a TV Guide for
the Internet, with listings of live events you can watch and
expanded coverage of other programming. A good place to get a sense
of what 500 million channels really means.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sightsound.com (www.sightsound.com): They hold the patents on
several key parts of the business of downloading music and movies
from the Net. And they hope to become the company helping studios
sell their stuff online. They already have dozens of mostly B
movies and independent works available. With their patents in their
back pocket, they've scaled up big time and plan to be a big
purveyor of studio product in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   _ Atom Films (www.atomfilms.com): Mika Salmi has been collecting
tons of short films, including ``Plug,'' the much-heralded
11-minute short by USC grad Meher Gourjian, and ``The Qui-Gon
Show,'' a parody of our favorite interstellar blockbuster from a
galaxy far, far away. One of the big stars of the new broadcasting
paradigm.
</P>
<P>
   _ WireBreak.com (www.wirebreak.com): ``Forget coffee, take a
wire break,'' goes the pitch from this Venice-based company trying
to attract the interest of college kids and corporate drones with
access to high-speed business or university connections. They're
producing four shows so far in bite-size chunks designed to appeal
to those with fast connections and short breaktimes.
</P>
<P>
   _ MediaTrip.com (www.mediatrip.com): The Hollywood-based company
has acquired Internet sites to some distinctive shows, such as the
``Shakespeare in Love'' spoof ``George Lucas in Love,'' and its own
original content, such as the way politically incorrect ``Lil'
Pimp'' animated series, a weekly stand-up comedy series at Largo in
Hollywood, plus a weekly music show.
</P>
<P>
   _ Digital Entertainment Network (www.den.net): An ambitious
Santa Monica-based company targeting very narrow slices of the teen
market, with 30 shows and related chat rooms, games, bulletin
boards and more for everything from fraternity slobs to Christian
teens to East L.A. youths to skatepunks. Short video segments are
optimized to play adequately even on slow connections.
</P>
<P>
   _ Film (www.ifilm.com): Like Atom, iFilm has been busily locking
up rights to a lot of shorts and other films by others. They have a
sleek site and a solid array of offerings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Yahoo Broadcast Services (www.yahoo.com): Yahoo bought
Broadcast.com for five really big ones (that would be billions of
dollars), tucked it into a corner and have been trying to figure
out how to best show off the hundreds of thousands of hours of
content Broadcast.com has accumulated. A lot of the archival stuff
is pretty great and now much more accessible. The vast archives
include a ton of news and other non-fiction material, plus lots of
oddball stuff.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eruptor.com (www.eruptor.com): Not a lot of stuff, but some
pretty gorgeous and interesting initial original programming. They
have marketing savvy and ambition, with their own set of ``Eruptor
girls'' and small-time stars such as Olivia D'Abo in their
programs.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Threshold (www.thethreshold.com): The same fellows who
brought you ``Mortal Kombat'' movies, games, TV shows and
everything else are now going online with an array of programs
pitched solely for young males. If you're about 24 and dripping
with testosterone, this is digital heaven: Duke Nukem, Conan the
Barbarian and Rena Mero (formerly WWF wrestler Sable) among much
else.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pseudo.com (www.pseudo.com): A New York-based Web
entertainment site with a wide array of its own programming,
including such things as a hip-hop show.
</P>
<P>
   _ Soundbreak.com (www.soundbreak.com): A music site that has
live DJs (complete with streaming video of them at work) playing a
wide array of music.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spike Radio (www.spikeradio.com): A quirky Net radio site with
internationalist techno tendencies, this Hollywood-based operation
is doing some video now, with plans to do a much wider base of
lifestyle and music in the next couple of years.

&HT;     U.S. ATTORNEY TO FOCUS ON STOCK, HIGH-TECH CRIME IN SILICON
VALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The top federal prosecutor in Northern
California said he would create special law-enforcement units to
focus on high-tech crime and stock fraud in the Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Robert S. Mueller III said one special unit would
prosecute violations of federal securities laws and another, dubbed
CHIP for Computer Hacker and Intellectual Property, would pursue
technology crimes.
</P>
<P>
   A third new unit will target official corruption, Mueller said,
while emphasizing that his office's first priority will remain
prosecuting crimes involving illegal weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller announced the reorganization of his office, which is
based in San Francisco, on Monday. The office has more than 100
lawyers who prosecute federal crimes committed between San Luis
Obispo and the Oregon border, and who file civil suits on behalf of
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller, 55, became interim U.S. attorney in August 1998,
inheriting an office that, legal observers said, was beset with
flagging morale, waning productivity and a lack of leadership under
his predecessor Michael Yamaguchi.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller, who ran the Criminal Division at U.S. Justice
Department headquarters in Washington under President George Bush,
was confirmed as U.S. attorney for the Northern District of
California last October.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller said he has used the past year to identity the region's
most important kinds of crime and to build better relationships
with investigative agencies like the FBI, Environmental Protection
Agency, and Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   A rise in criminal filings reflects those improvements, he said.
Last year his office lodged 915 criminal filings, including 665
felony indictments returned by grand juries. In 1998, the office
brought 664 total criminal filings in 1998, including 400 felony
indictments, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest boost in prosecutions came in bank robberies,
immigration scams, and in organized, white-collar crime and
environmental crime, Mueller said.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of filings stayed about the same in securities
fraud and health care, he said, noting that statistics alone don't
tell how well a prosecutor's office works and that more complex
cases take more time.
</P>
<P>
   The office last year also boosted to 61 the number of cases it
took to trial from 32 in 1998, Mueller said. It won all but six
cases last year.
</P>
<P>
   And it recovered through civil suits more money owed the
government, he said, bringing in $23 million last year compared to
$4.8 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Mueller said his office had stumbled ``too often'' in
collecting fines and restitution to victims that judges had ordered
in criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mueller announced these changes:
</P>
<P>
   _ A new Securities Fraud Unit will focus on crimes involving
stocks, such as manipulation of prices, insider trading and
falsified accounting.
</P>
<P>
   _ A new Special Prosecutions Unit will aim at corrupt public
officials and large frauds against the government, such as defense
contracting schemes.
</P>
<P>
   &Cx1f; _ A revamped White Collar Crime Unit will prosecute
environmental crimes, civil rights violations and health care
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   _ A streamlined General Crimes Unit will focus more on violent
crimes, including gun crimes and bank robberies as well as Social
Security fraud.
</P>
<P>
   _ The new Computer Hacker and Intellectual Property Unit will
target illegal computer intrusions by hackers; theft of trade
secrets, computer code and other intellectual property; and
economic espionage.
</P>
<P>
   This high-tech unit should be a resource for the rest of the
Justice Department, said Mueller, who formed a computer-crime unit
while assistant U.S. attorney general. ``In five or 10 years this
district ought to be the place where people go for that kind of
expertise,'' he said.

 &HT;    NFL star denied bond in Atlanta double murder
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All-Pro linebacker Ray Lewis of the Baltimore Ravens
was denied bond today on a double murder charge in connection with
the slayings of two men in a popular Atlanta entertainment
district.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with two counts of murder late Monday evening in
connection with the stabbing deaths, Lewis was handcuffed and
shackled as he slowly shuffled into a municipal courtroom to face
Judge Elaine Carlisle.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis seemed frightened and overwhelmed by the onslaught of TV
cameras and reporters aiming their attention at him. He blinked
several times, then stared at his feet.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, Max Richardson, said Lewis, 24, is innocent of the
charges and that the Atlanta Police Department is aware of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but he had
nothing to do with this,'' Richardson, an Atlanta attorney hired by
Lewis' agents, said. ``There are two other suspects and police know
that. My client was at the scene where these crimes took place, but
he had nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson would not elaborate on what he meant regarding two
other suspects, but said investigators are looking for other people
who were riding in a black Lincoln Navigator stretch limousine seen
roaring away from the intersection where the bodies of Jacinth
Baker and Richard Lollar lay early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, friends from Akron, Ohio, who had moved to an
Atlanta suburb, were stabbed repeatedly, said the Fulton County
Medical Examiner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Lewis was a passenger in the limousine, but have not
revealed who else was riding with the football star. Homicide
investigators spent most of Monday talking to the driver of the
limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Police would not comment this morning after Lewis' hearing was
reset to Feb. 24. Senior Assistant Solicitor Larry Gardner said
there were no witnesses in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll come back ... and the truth will come out,'' Richardson
said as he walked briskly from the courthouse. ``Ray is asking all
his friends and fans to pray for him.''

 &HT;    NFL star denied bond in Atlanta double murder

<P>
   ATLANTA _ All-Pro linebacker Ray Lewis of the Baltimore Ravens
was denied bond today on a double murder charge in connection with
the slayings of two men in a popular Atlanta entertainment
district.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with two counts of murder late Monday evening in
connection with the stabbing deaths, Lewis was handcuffed and
shackled as he slowly shuffled into a municipal courtroom to face
Judge Elaine Carlisle.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis seemed frightened and overwhelmed by the onslaught of TV
cameras and reporters aiming their attention at him. He blinked
several times, then stared at his feet.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, Max Richardson, said Lewis, 24, is innocent of the
charges and that the Atlanta Police Department is aware of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but he had
nothing to do with this,'' Richardson, an Atlanta attorney hired by
Lewis' agents, said. ``There are two other suspects and police know
that. My client was at the scene where these crimes took place, but
he had nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson would not elaborate on what he meant regarding two
other suspects, but said investigators are looking for other people
who were riding in a black Lincoln Navigator stretch limousine seen
roaring away from the intersection where the bodies of Jacinth
Baker and Richard Lollar lay early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, friends from Akron, Ohio, who had moved to an
Atlanta suburb, were stabbed repeatedly, said the Fulton County
Medical Examiner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Lewis was a passenger in the limousine, but have not
revealed who else was riding with the football star. Homicide
investigators spent most of Monday talking to the driver of the
limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Police would not comment this morning after Lewis' hearing was
reset to Feb. 24. Senior Assistant Solicitor Larry Gardner said
there were no witnesses in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll come back ... and the truth will come out,'' Richardson
said as he walked briskly from the courthouse. ``Ray is asking all
his friends and fans to pray for him.''

   HOT-CHOCOLATE (New York) _ I am willing to bet that very few
people have whiled away hours thinking about hot chocolate. Why
should anyone? When it's cold, as these past few weeks have been,
it's an easy pleaser. You either order it in a cafe, where it's hot
and chocolatey and the fluff of steamed milk allows you to justify
the $4. Or you go home, pull out some cocoa, sugar and milk and
have some steaming hot in a matter of minutes. Either alternative
is pretty good. But the truth is that most of these are the hot
chocolate equivalents of instant Folger's. If people only knew how
good hot chocolate can be, they might not put up with all the bad
versions around the city. By Amanda Hesser.

   CREPINETTE (New York) _ A critic's notebook: A fifth columnist
has infiltrated the menus of Manhattan. It has a deceptively
attractive name, so close to another French name that it passes
almost unnoticed by most diners. Once on the plate, it has already
undergone a metamorphosis, so its identity remains obscure. The
time has come to unmask it. The culprit is something called a
crepinette. It sounds as if it might be a little crepe. Once you
find out that the word is derived from crepine, or caul fat, you're
in way too deep to turn back. Yes, it's the membrane encasing a
pig's intestine. And no, it's neither more nor less than fat, the
most-feared word in the culinary vocabulary. But in the hands of
the right chef, and stuffed with the right ingredients, this
rock-bottom, low-peasant article, which comes to the kitchen in a
big folded heap like a used dishcloth, can rise to dizzying
heights. By William Grimes.

<P>
   To: Bud Selig, baseball commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   From: Sensitivity trainer-in-training.
</P>
<P>
   Re: The Rocker gig.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking about branching out professionally, and your
decision to have John Rocker undergo sensitivity training looks
like a bonanza of a career opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   I admit I have some reservations about the First Amendment
implications of suspending the guy from his job for making
offensive comments, but standing behind the Bill of Rights is
complicated, exhausting and not the least bit lucrative. So without
further Constitutional angst, let's just stipulate that baseball is
your candy store, Bud, and if you don't want to stock the shelves
with a nutbar, that's your business.
</P>
<P>
   My business, if you'd be so kind as to consider this job
application, would be turning Rocker into a thoughtful,
compassionate human being, or a reasonable facsimile thereof. If
you want the genuine article, that could be a very long, very
expensive proposition. But if a little varnish is all you're after,
we can do this for a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   My preference is to go for the cheap quickie. In the long run,
this approach will work better for both of us. If I get this
routine down, I'm pretty sure that volume business is waiting just
around the corner. All by himself, Ted Turner would be a gold mine.
The Atlanta Braves owner has already defended his rockhead reliever
on the grounds that the media are too tough on professional
athletes. He said that if Rocker weren't a famous athlete, people
would have let his racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic comments
slide.
</P>
<P>
   If I were training Mr. Turner, I'd have to agree that, yes,
Sports Illustrated interviewed Rocker only because he is a famous
athlete. And yes, people read the story because Rocker is a famous
athlete.
</P>
<P>
   But being interviewed by Sports Illustrated doesn't have to turn
a man into a national pariah. That was all Rocker's doing, and if
he now believes that being a famous athlete is such an enormous
burden, then he can stop being a famous athlete.
</P>
<P>
   No one's forcing him to take a seven-figure salary. He can go
flip burgers or pump gas, or research the viability of nuclear
fusion. Then Sports Illustrated would leave him alone.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this sort of advice reveals me to be a novice in this
field. I've confused sensitivity training with accountability
training, which is pretty much a waste of time. Either you take
responsibility for your actions or you don't.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't know how, you're about as likely to learn as I am
to put a Rocker fastball over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   So let me lay out my two strategies for rehabilitating Rocker.
The long, expensive one would involve introducing him to people
from different cultures, taking him to a gay bar, making him sit in
rooms with people who speak a different language so that he knows
how it feels to be an outsider. The list of things he needs to see
would go on and on. I'd take tape-recordings from foreign-born
baseball players, asking them to explain what they had to do to
reach the majors. He'd have to visit with any AIDS patients who
would tolerate his presence. I'd track down some of the
impoverished young athletes I've met, like the Latino football
player who cared for his sick mother, held a job, went to high
school and played sports to avoid trouble on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   This could take months, even years. Rocker would see things that
most baseball players never witness. He might grow up. He might
not.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want this resolved soon, we'll go this route: I'll
teach him how to say the right things, even if he doesn't mean
them. I'll send him into beaten-up neighborhoods to throw batting
practice for kids from the same ethnic groups he mocked. I'll make
sure the TV cameras show up for these events.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker can donate a few bats and gloves, proving how sensitive
he is to the kids' needs.
</P>
<P>
   When he comes back to baseball, he'll need to be especially
sensitive about getting people out. If he fails to do so, then
people in Atlanta might get really offended.
</P>
<P>
   When Rocker has his ERA below 3.00 again, the media will want to
write the redemption story. And as everybody knows, nothing
absolves a bigoted jerk better than striking out the side. You can
count on this, Bud. If Rocker pitches well, at least five reporters
will commend him for triumphing over adversity.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker may never be sensitive to the pain he causes others, but
he'll certainly be sensitive to what he's done to himself. If hired
for this task, I'll use that sensitivity to create the illusion of
the other kind, the real thing. I look forward to hearing from you.

   BUDAPEST _ The Cold War may be over, but international intrigue
swirls like cigarette smoke once again in the ornate Hapsburg-era
cafes of the Hungarian capital.
</P>
<P>
   The talk at the coffeehouse tables is of plots and midnight
liaisons, as the city hosts a new generation of secret agents.
</P>
<P>
   That sharply-suited man watching for his contact as he sips an
early morning coffee could just as likely be trading in classified
information as stocks and shares.
</P>
<P>
   Budapest is now the new spy capital of eastern Europe, as
competing secret services run elaborate intelligence-gathering
operations, both in the city and along the country's border
regions.
</P>
<P>
   Like postwar Vienna, immortalized in Orson Welles' classic film
noir, ``The Third Man,'' Budapest is now unwilling host to a host
of intelligence agencies, several of which are hostile to western
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Western intelligence services are also monitoring the activities
of several organized crime syndicates from the former Soviet Union
who use Budapest as their forward base.
</P>
<P>
   More spies have begun operating in Hungary in the last few
months, said Secret Services Minister Laszlo Kover, as Hungary's
NATO membership challenges local superpower interests as well those
of regional neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarian intelligence services now supply information to their
western partners, he told the daily newspaper Vilaggazdasag.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary's geographical position and long experience of dealing
with Balkan and Slavic neighbors gives its agents a head start in
the intelligence race, as well as a sharper insight into the
regional mind-set than that of western analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Perched on the northern rim of the Balkans and the former
Yugoslavia, bordering the former Soviet Union, Hungary offers
unrivalled opportunities for information gathering, particularly
since Hungary, along with Poland and the Czech Republic, joined
NATO last year.
</P>
<P>
   And straddling the dividing line between east and west, Hungary
shares borders with seven countries, from Austria to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any geo-strategic capital where there is a melting pot of east
and west and north and south is bound to be the target of hostile
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Budapest is a traditional meeting place, on the great trade
routes between east and west, a place to find things out, like
Nicosia,'' said a western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was powerless to stop NATO's expansion into its
former sphere of influence, Russia _ especially its army and
defense ministry _ is known to be deeply unhappy about the
Alliance's eastward spread.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary assumed a vital strategic role during the NATO onslaught
on Serbia last spring. As a country bordering Serbia, with a
substantial ethnic Hungarian population within Yugoslavia itself,
it was a natural target for infiltration by Serbian agents.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports of Serbian spying activity at the country's
two NATO air bases, at Taszar and Kaposvar, both in the south of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Budapest was also the meeting place of choice for clandestine
contacts between Serbs and Croats during the Yugoslav wars.
</P>
<P>
   The current strong cooperation between Hungarian and western
intelligence services cannot gloss over several embarrassing black
spots in the country's recent past.
</P>
<P>
   The world's most notorious terrorist, Carlos the Jackal, found
safe haven in Hungary for several years under the regime of the
former Communist leader Janos Kadar.
</P>
<P>
   The Hungarian army is now a NATO force, but many of its officers
were trained in Moscow, from where they returned with wives and
other strong ties to Russia. As a member of the former Socialist
bloc, Hungary also had trade ties with states such as Iraq, Iran
and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarian officials say that suspect intelligence and military
officials who were unable to make the necessary about-face from
Communism, to capitalism and the west, either retired or left after
the new reality was explained to them.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarians argue that the former ties to the Soviet bloc gives
them an advantage in dealing with Moscow as they understand the
Russian modus operandi. &QL;

<P>
   ``Who now remembers the Armenians?'' Hitler asked, just before
he embarked on the destruction of European Jewry.
</P>
<P>
   Precious few, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   As the memorial day for the Nazi genocide against the Jews was
proclaimed by British Prime Minister Tony Blair last week, there
was not a single reference to the slaughter of one and a half
million Armenian Christians by the Ottoman Turks in 1915.
</P>
<P>
   The world's first holocaust _ and Hitler's inspiration for the
slaughter of the Jews _ was ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Why, I wonder? Blair did not mention it. French President
Jacques Chirac is frightened of the very subject, refusing even to
condemn the slaughter when he last visited Beirut, where the
grandchildren of the victims live in their tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The United States government prefers to forget the holocaust of
Armenians, while the Turks _ the inheritors of the empire that
committed the worst atrocities of the First World War _ are
studiously denying the genocide.
</P>
<P>
   And we let them get away with it. Who, I wonder, chooses which
holocaust we should remember and which we should not?
</P>
<P>
   The six million Jews who were murdered by the Nazis must always
have a place in our history, our memory, our fears. Never again.
</P>
<P>
   But, alas, the Armenians who perished in the rivers of southern
Turkey, who were slaughtered in their tens of thousands in the
deserts of northern Syria, whose wives and daughters were
gang-raped and knifed to death by the gendarmerie and their Kurdish
militiamen _ they have no place in our memory or our history.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is our friend. Turkey might one day join the European
Union. Turkey is an ally of Israel. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 375 &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   History, of course, is a hard taskmaster, veined with
inconvenient facts and corrupted heroes as well as the massacre of
innocents.
</P>
<P>
   The Armenian community in Turkey had its Allied sympathizers
when the Ottoman army was fighting the British and French in the
First World War, and Armenians also fought in the czarist Russian
army against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   But the proof of genocide is intact. The Young Turk movement _
once a liberal organization which the Armenians had supported _ had
taken control of the dying empire and adopted a ``pan-Turkism''
which espoused a Turkish-speaking Muslim nation from Constantinople
to Baku.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of their victory over the Allies at the Dardanelles
in 1915, they fell upon the Armenians. Churchill was to refer to
the ``merciless fury'' unleashed upon the Christian minority.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ambassador in Constantinople _ himself a Jew _ wrote
heart-wrenching reports back to Washington of mass slaughter. Near
the Turkish village of Mus, hundreds of men were lined up on
bridges and shot into the rivers, Serb-style. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,100) &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Behind the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp in Poland, I was once taken
by a camp guide to a series of small lakes in which the Nazis
dumped the ash of the crematoria. Beneath the water and ice lay the
powdered white bones of whole cities of people.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the north Syrian desert there are still skulls and bones
in caves and in the clay of river banks.
</P>
<P>
   This place of martyrdom is visited once a year by the local
Armenian community to commemorate their holocaust. They even have a
holocaust memorial day. Yet I wonder if a single non-Armenian
reader of The Independent knows what the date is?
</P>
<P>
   Denial of the holocaust is in some countries a crime. I'm
talking, of course, about the Jewish Holocaust _ because denial of
the Armenian holocaust is not only perfectly legal, it is big
business.
</P>
<P>
   No American company selling weapons to Turkey will discuss the
holocaust of 1915.
</P>
<P>
   Chairs of Ottoman studies are being funded by the Turkish
government at American universities in which U.S. academics _ who
have to prove they have used Ottoman archives to get their jobs and
thus must never have condemned the 1915 slaughters _ propagate the
lie that the Armenians were merely victims of ``civil war'' and
that Turks also died in the chaos of 1915. Turks did. But not on
the Armenian scale.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who was to write that the Jews were victims of a European
civil war and that, anyway, ``Germans also died'' would be regarded
as cracked or a neo-Nazi. Not so if you deny the Armenian
holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Take the following letter, for example: ``The myth of the
`Armenian Holocaust' was created immediately after World War I with
the hope that the Armenians could be rewarded for their
`sufferings' with a piece of the disintegrating Ottoman state. As
such, the main aims of the inventors were political and
territorial.''
</P>
<P>
   Now substitute the word Armenian with the word Jew. Who would
ever get away with a letter about the ``myth of the Jewish
Holocaust'' as an invention of Jews who wanted to be rewarded for
``sufferings'' (the quotation marks suggesting their falsity)? Who
would ever publish such lies?
</P>
<P>
   But that letter was written about the Armenians. And it was
written by a Turkish ambassador. In fact _ heaven spare us _ it was
written by Barlas Ozener, the Turkish ambassador to Israel. And it
was printed, in full, in the Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
   But we Europeans are just as mendacious, if more discreetly so.
Take Chirac in Beirut. The French Assembly had just condemned the
Armenian holocaust of 1915 _ there are men of principle in French
politics.
</P>
<P>
   But not Chirac. When asked less than two years ago for his views
on the resolution, he replied: ``I do not comment on a matter of
domestic (sic) politics when I'm abroad.'' Would that have been his
response if the Assembly had just denounced the Jewish Holocaust?
</P>
<P>
   Blair said last week that as the Jewish survivors of the Nazi
Holocaust ``age and become fewer in number, it becomes more and
more our duty to take up the mantle and tell each new generation
what happened and what could happen again''
</P>
<P>
   But there are a few very Armenian survivors left. Why weren't
they asked last week about their memories?
</P>
<P>
   At Musa Dagh and later at Smyrna in 1920, British, French and
American warships rescued a few of the pitiful Armenian survivors
of that earlier Holocaust. But Blair was silent last week. And
silence gives consent.
</P>
<P>
   I am all for memorial days. Especially one that marks the Jewish
Holocaust. And especially memorial days for other holocausts.
Armenians too.
</P>
<P>
   But Hitler's ghost had a little laugh last week. After all, who
now remembers the Armenians? &QL;

<P>
   ``Who now remembers the Armenians?'' Hitler asked, just before
he embarked on the destruction of European Jewry.
</P>
<P>
   Precious few, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   As the memorial day for the Nazi genocide against the Jews was
proclaimed by British Prime Minister Tony Blair last week, there
was not a single reference to the slaughter of one and a half
million Armenian Christians by the Ottoman Turks in 1915.
</P>
<P>
   The world's first holocaust _ and Hitler's inspiration for the
slaughter of the Jews _ was ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Why, I wonder? Blair did not mention it. French President
Jacques Chirac is frightened of the very subject, refusing even to
condemn the slaughter when he last visited Beirut, where the
grandchildren of the victims live in their tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The United States government prefers to forget the holocaust of
Armenians, while the Turks _ the inheritors of the empire that
committed the worst atrocities of the First World War _ are
studiously denying the genocide.
</P>
<P>
   And we let them get away with it. Who, I wonder, chooses which
holocaust we should remember and which we should not?
</P>
<P>
   The six million Jews who were murdered by the Nazis must always
have a place in our history, our memory, our fears. Never again.
</P>
<P>
   But, alas, the Armenians who perished in the rivers of southern
Turkey, who were slaughtered in their tens of thousands in the
deserts of northern Syria, whose wives and daughters were
gang-raped and knifed to death by the gendarmerie and their Kurdish
militiamen _ they have no place in our memory or our history.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is our friend. Turkey might one day join the European
Union. Turkey is an ally of Israel. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 375 &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   History, of course, is a hard taskmaster, veined with
inconvenient facts and corrupted heroes as well as the massacre of
innocents.
</P>
<P>
   The Armenian community in Turkey had its Allied sympathizers
when the Ottoman army was fighting the British and French in the
First World War, and Armenians also fought in the czarist Russian
army against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   But the proof of genocide is intact. The Young Turk movement _
once a liberal organization which the Armenians had supported _ had
taken control of the dying empire and adopted a ``pan-Turkism''
which espoused a Turkish-speaking Muslim nation from Constantinople
to Baku.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of their victory over the Allies at the Dardanelles
in 1915, they fell upon the Armenians. Churchill was to refer to
the ``merciless fury'' unleashed upon the Christian minority.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ambassador in Constantinople _ himself a Jew _ wrote
heart-wrenching reports back to Washington of mass slaughter. Near
the Turkish village of Mus, hundreds of men were lined up on
bridges and shot into the rivers, Serb-style. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,100) &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Behind the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp in Poland, I was once taken
by a camp guide to a series of small lakes in which the Nazis
dumped the ash of the crematoria. Beneath the water and ice lay the
powdered white bones of whole cities of people.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the north Syrian desert there are still skulls and bones
in caves and in the clay of river banks.
</P>
<P>
   This place of martyrdom is visited once a year by the local
Armenian community to commemorate their holocaust. They even have a
holocaust memorial day. Yet I wonder if a single non-Armenian
reader of The Independent knows what the date is?
</P>
<P>
   Denial of the holocaust is in some countries a crime. I'm
talking, of course, about the Jewish Holocaust _ because denial of
the Armenian holocaust is not only perfectly legal, it is big
business.
</P>
<P>
   No American company selling weapons to Turkey will discuss the
holocaust of 1915.
</P>
<P>
   Chairs of Ottoman studies are being funded by the Turkish
government at American universities in which U.S. academics _ who
have to prove they have used Ottoman archives to get their jobs and
thus must never have condemned the 1915 slaughters _ propagate the
lie that the Armenians were merely victims of ``civil war'' and
that Turks also died in the chaos of 1915. Turks did. But not on
the Armenian scale.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who was to write that the Jews were victims of a European
civil war and that, anyway, ``Germans also died'' would be regarded
as cracked or a neo-Nazi. Not so if you deny the Armenian
holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Take the following letter, for example: ``The myth of the
`Armenian Holocaust' was created immediately after World War I with
the hope that the Armenians could be rewarded for their
`sufferings' with a piece of the disintegrating Ottoman state. As
such, the main aims of the inventors were political and
territorial.''
</P>
<P>
   Now substitute the word Armenian with the word Jew. Who would
ever get away with a letter about the ``myth of the Jewish
Holocaust'' as an invention of Jews who wanted to be rewarded for
``sufferings'' (the quotation marks suggesting their falsity)? Who
would ever publish such lies?
</P>
<P>
   But that letter was written about the Armenians. And it was
written by a Turkish ambassador. In fact _ heaven spare us _ it was
written by Barlas Ozener, the Turkish ambassador to Israel. And it
was printed, in full, in the Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
   But we Europeans are just as mendacious, if more discreetly so.
Take Chirac in Beirut. The French Assembly had just condemned the
Armenian holocaust of 1915 _ there are men of principle in French
politics.
</P>
<P>
   But not Chirac. When asked less than two years ago for his views
on the resolution, he replied: ``I do not comment on a matter of
domestic (sic) politics when I'm abroad.'' Would that have been his
response if the Assembly had just denounced the Jewish Holocaust?
</P>
<P>
   Blair said last week that as the Jewish survivors of the Nazi
Holocaust ``age and become fewer in number, it becomes more and
more our duty to take up the mantle and tell each new generation
what happened and what could happen again''
</P>
<P>
   But there are a few very Armenian survivors left. Why weren't
they asked last week about their memories?
</P>
<P>
   At Musa Dagh and later at Smyrna in 1920, British, French and
American warships rescued a few of the pitiful Armenian survivors
of that earlier Holocaust. But Blair was silent last week. And
silence gives consent.
</P>
<P>
   I am all for memorial days. Especially one that marks the Jewish
Holocaust. And especially memorial days for other holocausts.
Armenians too.
</P>
<P>
   But Hitler's ghost had a little laugh last week. After all, who
now remembers the Armenians? &QL;

   HOT-CHOCOLATE (New York) _ I am willing to bet that very few
people have whiled away hours thinking about hot chocolate. Why
should anyone? When it's cold, as these past few weeks have been,
it's an easy pleaser. You either order it in a cafe, where it's hot
and chocolatey and the fluff of steamed milk allows you to justify
the $4. Or you go home, pull out some cocoa, sugar and milk and
have some steaming hot in a matter of minutes. Either alternative
is pretty good. But the truth is that most of these are the hot
chocolate equivalents of instant Folger's. If people only knew how
good hot chocolate can be, they might not put up with all the bad
versions around the city. By Amanda Hesser.

   CREPINETTE (New York) _ A critic's notebook: A fifth columnist
has infiltrated the menus of Manhattan. It has a deceptively
attractive name, so close to another French name that it passes
almost unnoticed by most diners. Once on the plate, it has already
undergone a metamorphosis, so its identity remains obscure. The
time has come to unmask it. The culprit is something called a
crepinette. It sounds as if it might be a little crepe. Once you
find out that the word is derived from crepine, or caul fat, you're
in way too deep to turn back. Yes, it's the membrane encasing a
pig's intestine. And no, it's neither more nor less than fat, the
most-feared word in the culinary vocabulary. But in the hands of
the right chef, and stuffed with the right ingredients, this
rock-bottom, low-peasant article, which comes to the kitchen in a

<P>
   OXNARD, Calif. _ Scores of Coast Guard and Navy searchers
continued to comb the Pacific Ocean here Tuesday in a search for
wreckage or victims of Alaska Airlines Flight 261, which crashed on
Monday with 88 people aboard after reporting mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Officials continued to classify their mission as one of search
and rescue, but with water temperatures in the mid-50s any
likelihood of finding survivors was remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad time, a horrible tragedy,'' said Vice Adm. Tom
Collins of the Coast Guard. ``Our minds are on the mission, but our
hearts are with the families.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said that overnight, rescue workers had conducted 38
search patterns over a 15-square-mile area of a ``fairly
well-contained and tight debris field.'' He said they had recovered
four bodies _ an infant, an adult man and two women _ and 12 boxes
full of mostly small pieces of the aircraft, seat material and
personal effects.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators from
Washington arrived on the scene shortly before dawn, but declined
at a news briefing early Tuesday morning to give preliminary
details of their investigation into the crash.
</P>
<P>
   With water depths of several hundred feet and choppy seas with
10- to 12-foot swells, diving was all but impossible, and officials
said they were waiting to determine what unmanned diving or salvage
devices might later be used.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in a statement released by the White House,
expressed his sorrow for the 88 people aboard and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``In times of tragedy, the American people pull together as one
and offer their prayers and solace to those in need,'' Clinton
said. ``Today, our nation prays for the men and women who were
aboard Alaska Airlines Flight 261, and for their families and
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added, , ``Underlying all these efforts is a strong and
heroic determination to save lives and to find out exactly what
went wrong, so that lives can be saved in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The jet, an MD-83 headed from the Mexican beach resort of Puerto
Vallarta, had reported mechanical difficulties and requested
permission to land at Los Angeles International Airport, Ron
Wilson, a spokesman for San Francisco International Airport told a
local television station there.
</P>
<P>
   At about 4:30 p.m. Monday, the plane, Alaska Airlines Flight
261, was reported down in the ocean off the Naval Air Station at
Point Mugu, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An Alaska Airlines spokesman told reporters at Los Angeles
International Airport Monday evening that the pilots had radioed
reporting a problem with the plane's stabilizer trim, a device that
helps control the horizontal stabilizing mechanism that governs the
pitch of the plane's nose.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson reported that radar indicated that the plane fell from
17,000 feet and then was lost from radar screens. Skies were clear
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Air 261 is a seven-day-a-week flight from Puerto Vallarta
to San Francisco. It is scheduled to depart at 3:30 p.m. and arrive
at 5:05 p.m. It was then to continue on to Seattle, Alaska's
headquarters. The plane that usually flies the route is a MD-80, or
an updated model like the MD-83, which has two engines attached to
the fuselage near the tail. The models first entered service in
1980, and depending on configuration, usually carry 144 to 152
passengers. About 1,170 of them have been built.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-83 is the successor to the McDonnell-Douglas DC-9, and
like the Boeing 737 is frequently used on mid-range flights. The
jet was built less than eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If the pilots were having trouble trimming the horizontal
stabilizer, it would mean that they were having difficulty bringing
the plane into the proper pitch up or down.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer is brought into balance, or ``trimmed,'' by
spinning a wheel in the cockpit. When a plane has the proper trim,
its nose will fly level, instead of pitching up or down.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Evans, a spokesman for the airline, said the plane in
question had completed 14,315 cycles of takeoffs and landings. The
craft had more than 26,000 hours of flying time.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines, the nation's 10th largest, has built a
successful business and strong safety record operating north-south
routes serving more than 40 cities in Canada, Mexico and states up
and down the Pacific Coast. Alaska Airlines is a Seattle-based jet
carrier that operates 88 aircraft, including 38 MD-80s. It is the
nation's 10th largest airline.

<HEADLINE>
REMOTE MAINE COLLEGE HAS HARDY BASKETBALL TEAM AND FANS 
</HEADLINE>
 BCBKC-FORT-KENT-2 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT KENT, Maine _ Route 1 starts here.
</P>
<P>
   From Fort Kent, Houlton is Hilton Head, Bangor is Miami Beach,
Portland is Barbados, and Boston is Buenos Aires. Fort Kent is in
the far north of legendary Aroostook, America's largest county east
of the Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   And why, incidentally, have so many millions been led to believe
that Route 1 starts in Presque Isle? No, no, no. Leave the pier at
Key West, point the car north, pass through all those speed traps,
Auto Miles, shopping malls, and Main Streets and when, about 2,000
winding miles of asphalt later, you get to Presque Isle, you've
still got 58 miles of serious driving before you arrive in Fort
Kent.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Kent, Maine (a Rand McNally-listed population of 2,123),
there is, in fact, a recently-installed stoplight, even if some
folks hereabouts quip that the only reason for its presence is so
that Quigley's Hardware can mention it in radio spots. There is a
McDonald's. But there is no Starbucks, no Gap, no Victoria's
Secret, and this is one of the few places left in America where
it's tough to find a USA Today. Even the nearest Wal-Mart is back
in Presque Isle. There is one movie theater, the Plourde Century,
but don't expect to be seeing ``Topsy-Turvy'' any time soon. (This
week, you'd better like ``The Green Mile.'') Hey, but first things
first. There are two nail and tanning salons.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a college, and in the realm of looking like a
backdrop for a Sonja Henie Film Festival, and with a longitude of
47.23 north and a latitude of 68.56 west, there is no more isolated
college, and, therefore, college athletic program in the lower 48
states than the University of Maine-Fort Kent, and never mind
Western Washington University out there in Bellingham, which has
longitude-latitude readings of 48.73 and 122.43, respectively, but
which is in a town of 64,000 large enough to have a whole lot more
than one stoplight, not to mention its own daily newspaper. North?
Yup. Remote? Uh-uh.
</P>
<P>
   Athletically speaking, Fort Kent is the home office of remote.
So it is entirely fitting that in the midst of the ice and the snow
and the subzero temperatures, there is a nice little basketball
team, a ranked one, if you don't mind, a team whose Y2K fantasy is
a postseason bid to the NAIA Division 2 tournament (coming this
year to the unspeakable tackiness of Branson, Mo.), a team that has
brought together so many elements of our increasingly compact
global society that, as one local puts it, ``John Rocker wouldn't
like this team.''
</P>
<P>
   No, he wouldn't, not with the Bosnian Croat and the Bosnian
proper and the Lithuanian and the Canadian and the black kid from
London and the kid from Long Island and the dramatically
culture-shocked kid from Florida and the two kids who actually come
from Maine and, finally, the 5-foot-6-inch shooting guard who
cheerfully 'fesses up to having no point guard skills whatsoever
and who, it says here, lays open-and-shut claim to being the
greatest Laotian-born basketball player ever to draw a breath in
the history of this entire planet.
</P>
<P>
   Is that a diverse enough bunch for you? And have we mentioned
the coach, himself a black Londoner who admits that he usually
learns a lot more from these kids than they learn from him?
</P>
<P>
   His name is Derek Johnson, and after prepping for this gig by
spending his college career downstate at the University of
Maine-Machias, he is now addicted to this lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's isolated, all right,'' he says. ``But the feeling you get
here is such a good feeling that the isolation you feel is when you
leave here to go back where you came from. When I go back to
London, I can't wait to get back here, because, to me, London now
feels so crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   Such touching testimony to the virtues of Fort Kent, both town
and school, is a downright symphonic sound to the ears of Dr.
Charles Lyons, the ebullient school president who is so energetic,
gregarious, and unpretentious that he can only be thought of as the
anti-Silber. Lyons is proud of what's going on at his school, which
was continuously threatened with closure by the state legislature
during the early and mid '90s. A 27-year teaching and
administrative veteran of the University of Maine system _ he still
teaches one Introduction to Special Education course _ he was
brought into a dying school four years ago and given a simple
mandate: Increase the enrollment or we'll shutter the doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was Dick Radatz being asked to come in here and throw heat
for three innings,'' he says. ``And I had to want the ball every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   President Supercloser now points to some impressive numbers, the
most important of which is an enrollment that has soared 44 percent
in the past two years. With more than 1,000 students, 750 of which
are full-time enrollees, UMFK is now, as the president puts it,
``maxed out.'' Why, UMFK is no longer the smallest school in the
system, having passed Maine-Machias. The current priority is a
building campaign to ``grow the infrastructure to match the place
we have here.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Being a cozy place with no secrets, it's not for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good if it's what you need,'' acknowledges Tim Farrar, a
guard from West Paris, Maine. ``But if someone whispers, it's a
shout across the campus.''
</P>
<P>
   There may not be Big Brother, but there is always Dr. Charlie,
who gives new meaning to the term ``hands-on boss.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't take any junk in the dorms,'' he explains. ``The best
way to kill enrollment is to have a lot of rowdyism in the dorms.
If we get it, someone's gonna be smelling momma's cooking
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Cut a class if you like, but expect to be confronted, with the
president himself. Charlie Lyons knows all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get around,'' he smiles. ``Here I can make the `visites de
parois,' the visits of the parish priest. You can't do that
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, the lapse into French. Across the river lies Clair, New
Brunswick, where the Maple Leaf Restaurant and Motel seductively
blinks garish lights to lure the kids across the border for the
under-21 drinking opportunities. Quebec is not far away. Spend any
time in Fort Kent and you will hear both French and Franglais. In
the local eating spots. At the hardware store. At the gas station.
Everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother lays French on me all the time,'' says Julie
Marquis, a Fort Kent native who plays for the women's basketball
team. ``But I think it's finally dying out in the younger
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dommage. (Too bad.)
</P>
<P>
   Language issues aside, town and gown are seamless. The school
sells what the town sells, and that means family, safety, security,
and trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the Paradis Supermarket,'' points out Lyons. ``Every
night there will be 200 cars in the parking lot. They'll all be
running. No one worries. No one will think anything of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cars running in the parking lot is a suitable metaphor for the
college itself. No one comes to UMFK to face these harsh winters
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The professors care,'' confirms Shaun Tomblin, a rugged,
6-foot-3-inch senior from Rego Park, N.Y., who has given the
Bengals a solid inside presence and some serious locker room
leadership. ``If someone were to ask me what it's like here, I'd
say it's like sending your kid off to summer camp. It's isolated,
yes, but that means there are few distractions. You can concentrate
on the things that make you a better person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The teachers care,'' echoes Robert Miller, whose path from
Palm Beach to Fort Kent includes various run-ins with the law and a
sobering educational visit to a Florida state pen that told him,
whoa, there might be another way to go. ``They are committed to
you. I'm glad I found this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Miller says he's on track to graduate, and when he does,
he is taking that piece of parchment and waving it in certain
people's faces back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to prove to some critics, including people in my own
family, that I'm not a waste,'' he asserts. ``I want to go home
with that college degree and say, `I did it.' ''

   TAKE-BOS  
 FORT KENT, Maine: ... `I did it.' ''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not as if Derek Johnson's 17-3 team has come out of some
basketball test tube. The Bengals were 23-4 last year, after all.
By hiring Jim Graffam four years ago, Charlie Lyons was telling the
world he was interested in a quality athletic program, the Graffam
name being synonymous with both basketball and basketball
excellence in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in Maine knows Jim Graffam,'' says Lyons, who is
clearly grateful to have Graffam as a two-year coach and now as an
athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   Graffam deflects all such praise with a roll of his eyes. All he
knows is that he certainly never thought he'd wind up here, at The
End of the Earth. But now he's got this nice house less than five
minutes from the school and he's got the DirecTV and all the
necessary Internet access, so why not? If all goes well, the school
will soon be joining the likes of Husson, St. Joseph's, and Thomas
in the Maine Athletic Conference and that will mean better
competition and increased exposure. It might even make scheduling a
little easier.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, it should facilitate recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   You think recruiting is tough in Division 1? Try recruiting in
Division 3, or, in this case, NAIA Division 2, with no
scholarships. Then try selling a school where your neighbors might
turn out to be Dasher, Prancer, and Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   So where did Graffam get players good enough to be 40-7 the past
two years?
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our foreign and black kids are here on diversity
scholarships,'' he points out. As school vice president of
administration John Martin explains, ``Each of the state schools
has a special waiver for `diversity' students. This state is so
white. How else would we diversify?''
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to diversify yourself, why not start with Drazen
Jozic and Dennis Traup, a pair of teammates on a Bosnian youth team
who came over to the US in '91 for a basketball tour and who were
quite literally abandoned in Chicago when the bombs began to fall
back home? You read that right. They were stuck in Chicago with no
family, no money, and not a word of English between them.
</P>
<P>
   But this remains, in case you've forgotten, a great country. And
these are truly amazing kids. They were given foster homes. They
went to high school in Chicago. And here they are, playing for the
University of Maine-Fort Kent Bengals. TV movie, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Take 5-9 Drazen Jozic away from this team, and it's in deep
doo-doo, for Drazen Jozic has been leading all of America's NAIA
Division 2 players in assists, which is only the half of what he
brings to the table. That ``L'' stamped on his forehead stands for
``leadership,'' Jozic being the kind of kid who will not only dole
out an assist or drill a clutch three, but will also bang on a
teammate's door the next morning to make sure he doesn't miss
class. It is, says Coach Johnson, typical of his veteran players,
most of whom are uncommonly mature.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is tremendous peer pressure on this team,'' says
Johnson. ``They all want to improve and they don't want to let each
other down.''
</P>
<P>
   The bonding is multi-layered. First, each is an athletic reject
of some kind, whether it's Jozic at 5-9 or Shaun Tomblin at 6-3 or
Barkleyesque Floridian Robert Miller as a 6-4 center (who just
happens to have been leading the country in field goal percentage)
or some of the others who had been told they were too short or too
slow or too something, right down to Phone Phetvixay, the
aforementioned 5-6 Laotian-born and Lowell-bred bombardier who has
had as many as seven 3-pointers in a game (``Shooting is my natural
talent'') but has no point guard proclivities. Welcome to NCAA
Division 3 and NAIA Division 2 basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, they are bonded by the Outward Bound nature of their
chosen environment. (Suggested motto: The Team That Shivers
Together Delivers Together.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they are bonded by their astonishing personal
differences. Who needs a stamped visa when all you have to do to
gain some insight into a foreign culture is knock on someone's
door?
</P>
<P>
   How many college teams amuse themselves on road trips by
teaching each other languages?
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about this team,'' says Jozic, whose dream is to
play professionally in Croatia, ``there are so many cultures. When
we have nothing else to do, we learn some more language. We're
never bored. We talk about what it's like back in each of our
homes. I really think that's one reason why we play together so
well on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I can speak a little of all their languages,'' says
Phetvixay, a Lowell Catholic grad who emigrated from Laos when he
was 7. ``I was red-shirted last year, and I was down. I came close
to leaving. But Drazen said to me, `How could you go to another
school and think you'll meet people like us?' So I stayed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The opponent on this occasion is the archrival. When you're Fort
Kent, your version of the Great Satan is _ what else? _ Presque
Isle, the haughty team from the big city with the Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   And it is a serious rivalry. The soccer teams play for the
coveted Potato Barrel, and Johnson can get passionate about that
because he's also the assistant soccer coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hadn't beaten them in about 10 years,'' says Johnson. ``We
beat them the first time this year at their place and the place
went nuts. When they came back for the second game, someone had a
sign, `Home of the Potato Barrel,' and they were very angry.''
</P>
<P>
   At game time, UMFK is 14-3 and UMPI (or, as it's known in Maine
athletic circles, ``Umpee'') is 4-9. UMFK had won the first game by
18 down in Presque Isle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't matter,'' warns Johnson. ``This a big rivalry game.
They'll be up for us. After all, the winner is King of the
County.'' And a huge county it is, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   UMFK's gym is located inside the 25-year-old Sports Center, and
it is a perfectly commodious 1,000-seat home court that, on this
crisp January night, will bring about 500 students and local
followers in from the cold at prices ranging from $3 for adults to
50 cents for elementary students to zero for ID-carrying UMFK
students, faculty, and staff. They will get the blaring rock music,
the dancing girls, the Bengal mascot, and the spotlight intros and
they will also get a disappointingly so-so performance from their
beloved basketball team, which grabs an early lead and then plays
as if it thinks it couldn't possibly lose.
</P>
<P>
   But it almost does. Things get hairy in the end, and when the
buzzer sounds the Bengals have won by only a 68-65 score and Coach
Johnson has some good coaching oratory ready for the next day since
what he has seen is a team that appeared to believe its press
clippings (even if there are precious few) and seems to have taken
its heady and unprecedented No. 26 NAIA Division 2 ranking to
heart.
</P>
<P>
   A few of his players already know what to expect. ``This is a
game I personally like,'' says Tomblin. ``It tells us where we
really are as a team. We almost blew it. We'll learn something from
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The game is over, and there being no sports information director
_ are you nuts? _ athletic director Graffam phones the results and
rundown to Presque Isle sportscaster Rene Cloukey, and when Graffam
returns home for the customary postgame get-together with the
staff, he can see the complete results of his efforts come to life
on Channel 8. And so another day at The End of the Earth comes to a
close.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning the temperature on the First Citizens Bank
clock is minus-22. Better them than you, is that what you're
saying? Maybe so. But later that day a school president will be
asking a female student/athlete/mom how her baby is, and that
evening 200 cars will be running outside a supermarket. And there's
an awful lot to be said for that, isn't there?

&HT;     ALASKA AIRLINES FINED SEVERAL TIMES BY REGULATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KEAY DAVIDSON and SCOTT WINOKUR  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Despite a generally excellent safety record,
Alaska Airlines has been hit with a series of fines and penalties
in the past decade, and it is the subject of a criminal
investigation into the way it handled maintenance records.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of incidents involving Alaska Airlines MD-80
series aircraft, U.S. Department of Transportation officials seized
cartons of documents about three of the planes at the airline's
hangars in Oakland and Seattle just before Christmas 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, an investigation has been under way into alleged
faking of maintenance records.
</P>
<P>
   John Liotine, a lead mechanic for the airline, set the
investigation into motion in October 1998 when he contacted an
inspector with the Federal Aviation Administration, according to
the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   Records released under the Freedom of Information Act last year
showed that Liotine had complained that an Alaska Airlines
supervisor had filled out a post-maintenance checklist on an MD-80
even though he was not qualified to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The airline repairs its 39 MD-80s at the Oakland maintenance
center.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation involves a federal grand jury in San
Francisco, the FBI, the Department of Transportation and the U.S.
attorney's office. No charges have been filed in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Jacobs, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney, declined comment
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has recommended that the mechanic licenses of three
Alaska Airlines supervisors in Oakland be revoked for making false
entries in records.
</P>
<P>
   The airline has faced other woes, including a $250,000 FAA fine
in 1997 for failing to repair a leak in the fuel tank of an MD-80.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1997, the FAA fined Alaska Airlines $810,000 for
improperly modifying the main landing gear system of a Boeing 737,
then flying the aircraft. The fine was extremely large by industry
standards, according to legal experts.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FAA, a 1996 inspection turned up improper work
done on the aircraft between 1992 and 1996. The FAA alleged that in
March 1992 the airline had installed new wheels and brakes ``in a
manner that did not fully comply with all of the requirements of
the manufacturer's service bulletin.'' The plane was operated on
more than 9,000 passenger-carrying flights with the improperly
installed main landing gear system in place.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA reported that Alaska Airlines had acknowledged its
improper alterations and adopted procedures to prevent a
recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   And in December 1998, the FAA fined Alaska Airlines $55,000 for
violations of federal aviation hazardous materials regulations. The
FAA said the airline had loaded kerosene and other flammable fuel
on a passenger flight from Anchorage to Kotzebue, Alaska. The pilot
was not given written notification of the hazardous cargo,
according to the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said the airline had carried an excessive number of
packages for the same flight.
</P>
<P>
   FAA records also show the following disciplinary actions against
the airline in recent years:
</P>
<P>
   _ Three other hazardous materials violations in 1994, 1996 and
1997, totaling $64,448 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   _ Twelve security violations in 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997
totaling $54,250 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   _ One flight operations violation in 1996, resulting in a fine
of $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ One maintenance violation in 1994, bringing a fine of $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two unspecified violations in 1996 and 1998 totaling $10,000
in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the MD-80 series is one of the best in the air, judging
by FAA flight safety records, and Alaska Airlines has had few fatal
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The planes, which include the longer-range MD-83 that crashed
Monday, has a fatality rate of 0.4 deaths per million flights, the
second-best showing of 22 aircraft models except the Saab 340,
according to FAA records available through June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's last fatal accident was in 1976, when one person
died of a heart attack as a Boeing 727 ran off a runway in Alaska.
Before that, it lost 111 people when one of its planes slammed into
an Alaska mountain in 1971.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush, clutching the family
coattails, showed off mom Barbara, dad George and three siblings on
a New Hampshire platform in support of his presidential campaign
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   This raises the inevitable question of just which Bush is the
candidate here _ the former president, the first lady or their
eldest son. Family values are okay but if this act is endlessly
repeated, voters may find it too much of a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Can George W. stand on his own two feet alone or not? Are voters
supposed to judge him on his individual merits or cast nostalgic
ballots in memory of his father's administration, which ended seven
years ago and looks better in retrospect than it did at the time?
</P>
<P>
   The governor's parents remain popular among Republicans, and he
needs all the help he can get in a contest that's not turning out
to be the smooth coronation he anticipated. But voters don't elect
entire families. There's just one name on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   We can have only one president at a time, and on his head rests
all the authority and responsibility of the office. The job is not
a time-share.
</P>
<P>
   Bush cannot, of course, deny the family ties. His name
identification has been very helpful in collecting nearly $70
million in campaign contributions and the endorsements of hundreds
of Republican establishment leaders. His parents' connections paved
the way for a serious candidacy. It does not hurt that many voters
feel an apple never falls far from the tree.
</P>
<P>
   His political lineage is impressive. His grandfather, Prescott
Bush, was a senator from Connecticut. His father George held a
string of important political appointments before being elected
vice president and then president. His brother Jeb is governor of
Florida. His mother Barbara is one of the country's best-known,
best-liked women.
</P>
<P>
   But there are limits to the power of dynasties. Massachusetts
Sen. Edward Kennedy is a classic example. He ran for president in
1980 largely on the strength of the enduring legend of his two
martyred brothers, President John F. Kennedy and Sen. Robert
Kennedy. But the younger Kennedy, an inept candidate, offended
voters by acting as though he deserved the White House as a matter
of inheritance. He lost the Democratic nomination to President
Jimmy Carter and has not been considered presidential material
since.
</P>
<P>
   Bush the son and Bush the father are affectionately proud of
each other, and the elder Bush frequently volunteers campaign
advice. The younger Bush acknowledges he has learned a few lessons
from his father's experience, including not to rest on his laurels
and expect voters to support him out of gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   But both stress that the governor has his own campaign style and
is not simply a younger copy of his father. Their views on social
and economic issues, however, are practically identical. For
instance, one thing we can expect from a second Bush presidency is
an unbending line against raising taxes. A retreat from his ``no
new taxes'' pledge helped do in the elder Bush's re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball's in his court,'' the former president said in a
recent New York Times interview.
</P>
<P>
   The son, in fact, is trying hard to create an image of himself
as a Washington outsider compared with his likely Democratic rival,
Vice President Al Gore, the son of a Tennessee senator. Al Gore
grew up in Washington and later spent much of his adult life in
Congress. Anticipating the Bush country-boy approach, Gore
countered by moving his own campaign headquarters from Washington
to Tennessee and shedding his formal suits for leisure attire.
</P>
<P>
   To transform himself into a good ole boy from the sticks, Bush
emphasizes his Texas roots and ignores his Ivy League education and
his parents' long identification as members in good standing of the
GOP Washington establishment. It will be tricky to hold forth as
simultaneously the heir of a wealthy, powerful political family and
an ordinary guy with no special advantages, but it will be fun to
watch George W. try.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Can Europe, or indeed Japan and the rest of Asia, ever catch up?
</P>
<P>
   Last week the American boom becomes the longest in the country's
history. It is an interesting statistic for Britons, because we
experienced that particular delight _ our longest boom _ in the
middle of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, hardly anybody noticed. But it is a statistic that raises
fundamental questions about the changing nature of economic
success, as well, of course, as about the durability of the
American boom.
</P>
<P>
   It also, as the euro falls ever lower against the dollar, raises
uncomfortable questions about Europe's future economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The discomfort is all the greater because that is not as it was
meant to be. Put aside the plight of the euro, because at some
stage it will eventually recover, and recall the dismissive
attitude to the U.S. that was prevalent on the Continent for most
of the Nineties.
</P>
<P>
   In the early part of the decade, most Europeans criticized
American business for its lack of dynamism, its failure to invest
enough and its emphasis on price rather than quality.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of the decade, the line of attack shifted to
criticizing American corporate brutality, the ways in which
businesses were bought and sold and the way workers were ``let
go.'' Yes, the U.S. might be becoming more competitive, but it was
at unacceptable social costs.
</P>
<P>
   You still hear the second line of attack now, though it has been
blunted by the success of the U.S. in creating new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   What, one may ask, is more brutal: making people shift jobs
frequently or condemning them to unemployment? But the European
perception now seems to have shifted to one of bewilderment and
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   What on earth are the Americans doing that has enabled them to
be so successful, and surely that success cannot really last? There
seem to me to be three elements to the American success story that
continental Europeans in particular would be wise to note.
</P>
<P>
   Not Britons? Well, yes, we need to note, too, but we are already
something of a halfway house between the Continent and the U.S.,
not just culturally but in the performance of the economy. Ours has
grown more rapidly than any big European economy over the last
eight years, but more slowly than the American.
</P>
<P>
   The first element of U.S. success is that the key difference
between the States and everyone else is not in the quality of its
big businesses but rather in its ability to create new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Look at, say, Procter &AMP; Gamble and Unilever: there is not that
big a difference between them. If, on the other hand, you look at
new businesses, there is a radical difference.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not just that in Europe we create fewer new
businesses, it is also that very few of the ones we do create grow
to be really big, at least on the time-scale of the U.S. We have no
Microsoft, no Intel, no AOL.
</P>
<P>
   The high performance of the U.S. has been driven, more than
anything else, by such hi-tech companies. If you can create a few
of them, they will pull along the rest. Roughly three-quarters of
U.S. growth last year came from sectors of the economy that barely
existed a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   That leads to the second element of U.S. success: the ability to
develop commercial applications for new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans, to generalize, would rather have the kudos of
inventing something than the dosh from applying it. Sadly, it is
the applications that drive economies forward, not the inventions.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the growing importance of the English language. Look
around the world _ virtually all English-speaking economies are
growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the native speakers, though, countries that speak
English well (Sweden, the Netherlands) are storming along, while
those that speak it badly (most notably Japan) are struggling. It
is wholly unfair, but during the Nineties English quite became the
default language for the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   If that is right, what are the lessons? I think that the
non-American world has to accept that the U.S. will remain the
dominant economy for the next 20 years, maybe longer.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the U.S. boom will come to an end, as will ours. But the
forces that created the success story will continue, so when the
U.S. economy recovers it will experience another burst of growth. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If that is right, there is a choice for the rest of us. Do we
cooperate or do we compete?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we should try to imitate the reasons for America's
success: create a tax and regulatory climate that encourages
business start-ups and, if we can, a culture that seeks commercial
applications for new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   And for countries that do not speak English, they had better
learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooperate or compete?'' is the great strategic issue and one
that is of particular importance to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The instinct of much of continental Europe is to compete: to
create, in the EU, a counterbalance to American economic power.
Some Europeans are quite explicit about that. For example, the
advocates of the euro seek to create a rival to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   A large section of the British establishment also takes that
line, believing that the best economic option for Britain is to
compete against the U.S., using the much larger European market as
a base. Under that strategy, Britain should try to help Europe to
catch up with the U.S. by trying to teach it Anglo-Saxon ways.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative view is that we should cooperate with the U.S.,
acting, so to speak, as the chief subcontractor for America in the
European time zone.
</P>
<P>
   In practice we already do that, being the chief recipient for
U.S. investment in Europe. During the last year, such a view has
tended to gain ground as the U.S. boom has continued and the
British economy has again outpaced the German and Italian
economies.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of actual GDP at market prices, we will also have
become larger than France, though whether that position will last
will depend on the durability of the present sterling exchange
rate. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,300) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, there is one other reason to believe that
America's out-performance will continue, maybe not every year, but
on average through the next two decades. It is demography.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. will gradually become the youngest of the Group of
Seven nations over the next 20 years, while Germany and Italy, with
their very low birth rates, become very old.
</P>
<P>
   Young countries tend to grow faster than old ones, as countries
with a high proportion of retired people have to spend more and
more of their income on supporting the old, instead of investing in
future growth.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is somewhere in between continental Europe and the U.S.
in its demographic profile: our traditional mid-Atlantic status
applies even to demography.
</P>
<P>
   From a UK point of view, therefore, it seems most rational to
celebrate the long American boom and to regard as irrelevant
whether Europe and Japan catch up or not.
</P>
<P>
   If continental Europe does recover a bit of ground vis-a-vis the
U.S., that is great, because as the most U.S.-oriented European
economy, we will be pulled along by that progress.
</P>
<P>
   If it does not, we have plan B: promote our role as
subcontractor to American business, acting as the best entry point
into the European market but also creating intellectual products
that we can sell into the North American one.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the U.S. boom surely conveys one overriding message:
somehow or other we should continue to hitch our wagon to the
American star. &QL;

meant to be. Put aside the plight of the euro, because at some
stage it will eventually recover, and recall the dismissive
attitude to the U.S. that was prevalent on the Continent for most
of the Nineties.
</P>
<P>
   In the early part of the decade, most Europeans criticized
American business for its lack of dynamism, its failure to invest
enough and its emphasis on price rather than quality.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of the decade, the line of attack shifted to
criticizing American corporate brutality, the ways in which
businesses were bought and sold and the way workers were ``let
go.'' Yes, the U.S. might be becoming more competitive, but it was
at unacceptable social costs.
</P>
<P>
   You still hear the second line of attack now, though it has been
blunted by the success of the U.S. in creating new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   What, one may ask, is more brutal: making people shift jobs
frequently or condemning them to unemployment? But the European
perception now seems to have shifted to one of bewilderment and
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   What on earth are the Americans doing that has enabled them to
be so successful, and surely that success cannot really last? There
seem to me to be three elements to the American success story that
continental Europeans in particular would be wise to note.
</P>
<P>
   Not Britons? Well, yes, we need to note, too, but we are already
something of a halfway house between the Continent and the U.S.,
not just culturally but in the performance of the economy. Ours has
grown more rapidly than any big European economy over the last
eight years, but more slowly than the American.
</P>
<P>
   The first element of U.S. success is that the key difference
between the States and everyone else is not in the quality of its
big businesses but rather in its ability to create new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Look at, say, Procter &AMP; Gamble and Unilever: there is not that
big a difference between them. If, on the other hand, you look at
new businesses, there is a radical difference.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not just that in Europe we create fewer new
businesses, it is also that very few of the ones we do create grow
to be really big, at least on the time-scale of the U.S. We have no
Microsoft, no Intel, no AOL.
</P>
<P>
   The high performance of the U.S. has been driven, more than
anything else, by such hi-tech companies. If you can create a few
of them, they will pull along the rest. Roughly three-quarters of
U.S. growth last year came from sectors of the economy that barely
existed a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   That leads to the second element of U.S. success: the ability to
develop commercial applications for new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans, to generalize, would rather have the kudos of
inventing something than the dosh from applying it. Sadly, it is
the applications that drive economies forward, not the inventions.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the growing importance of the English language. Look
around the world _ virtually all English-speaking economies are
growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the native speakers, though, countries that speak
English well (Sweden, the Netherlands) are storming along, while
those that speak it badly (most notably Japan) are struggling. It
is wholly unfair, but during the Nineties English quite became the
default language for the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   If that is right, what are the lessons? I think that the
non-American world has to accept that the U.S. will remain the
dominant economy for the next 20 years, maybe longer.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the U.S. boom will come to an end, as will ours. But the
forces that created the success story will continue, so when the
U.S. economy recovers it will experience another burst of growth. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If that is right, there is a choice for the rest of us. Do we
cooperate or do we compete?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we should try to imitate the reasons for America's
success: create a tax and regulatory climate that encourages
business start-ups and, if we can, a culture that seeks commercial
applications for new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   And for countries that do not speak English, they had better
learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooperate or compete?'' is the great strategic issue and one
that is of particular importance to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The instinct of much of continental Europe is to compete: to
create, in the EU, a counterbalance to American economic power.
Some Europeans are quite explicit about that. For example, the
advocates of the euro seek to create a rival to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   A large section of the British establishment also takes that
line, believing that the best economic option for Britain is to
compete against the U.S., using the much larger European market as
a base. Under that strategy, Britain should try to help Europe to
catch up with the U.S. by trying to teach it Anglo-Saxon ways.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative view is that we should cooperate with the U.S.,
acting, so to speak, as the chief subcontractor for America in the
European time zone.
</P>
<P>
   In practice we already do that, being the chief recipient for
U.S. investment in Europe. During the last year, such a view has
tended to gain ground as the U.S. boom has continued and the
British economy has again outpaced the German and Italian
economies.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of actual GDP at market prices, we will also have
become larger than France, though whether that position will last
will depend on the durability of the present sterling exchange
rate. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,300) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, there is one other reason to believe that
America's out-performance will continue, maybe not every year, but
on average through the next two decades. It is demography.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. will gradually become the youngest of the Group of
Seven nations over the next 20 years, while Germany and Italy, with
their very low birth rates, become very old.
</P>
<P>
   Young countries tend to grow faster than old ones, as countries
with a high proportion of retired people have to spend more and
more of their income on supporting the old, instead of investing in
future growth.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is somewhere in between continental Europe and the U.S.
in its demographic profile: our traditional mid-Atlantic status
applies even to demography.
</P>
<P>
   From a UK point of view, therefore, it seems most rational to
celebrate the long American boom and to regard as irrelevant
whether Europe and Japan catch up or not.
</P>
<P>
   If continental Europe does recover a bit of ground vis-a-vis the
U.S., that is great, because as the most U.S.-oriented European
economy, we will be pulled along by that progress.
</P>
<P>
   If it does not, we have plan B: promote our role as
subcontractor to American business, acting as the best entry point
into the European market but also creating intellectual products
that we can sell into the North American one.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the U.S. boom surely conveys one overriding message:
somehow or other we should continue to hitch our wagon to the
American star. &QL;

 &HT;    LITTLE EXPECTED FROM CONGRESS IN SHORT WORK YEAR
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress, just back in town after two months of
recess, is planning for a shortened work year that could also be
short on accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Already, lawmakers have set a maximum of only 131 legislative
days in the Senate calendar and 118 in the House, even fewer than
during the 1996 presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   And the workdays this year could be reduced further as members
lop off Mondays and Fridays to extend weekends and take long
holiday breaks to renew ties with voters back home.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves little time for unfinished agenda items or the some
120 new or enlarged programs that President Clinton packed into his
89-minute State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, hardly warmed up for the legislative year,
are taking this Thursday and Friday off for a retreat at Nemacolin
Woodlands Resort and Spa in Farmington, Pa., where time for skiing
or exercise is scheduled between the legislative strategy sessions.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats plan to take this weekend and next Monday for a
similar retreat at the posh Homestead Resort in Hot Springs, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Although the lawmakers will be in session only eight months for
their 12-month salary, which has just jumped to a minimum of
$141,300, it's far from certain that anyone will complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``During a time of unprecedented peace and prosperity, there's
very little evidence that the American people are clamoring for
action in Washington,'' said Marshall Wittmann, congressional
analyst for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no particular issue that is causing phones to ring off
the hook on Capitol Hill. So in many ways, the public shares the
sentiment of many in Congress, which is, 'Don't do anything to foul
up this prosperity we're all enjoying.' ``
</P>
<P>
   At the more liberal Brookings Institution, congressional expert
Sarah Binder drew a similar conclusion. ``Should voters feel
robbed?'' she asked. ``I'm not sure that voters would necessarily
see it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Binder said that with the current gridlock on Capitol
Hill between Republicans and Democrats, ``I don't think having more
days would necessarily create the conditions to resolve these
public policy disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., speaking to the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday, said that the lawmakers would take
off all of August for the national party conventions and close up
shop for the ``abbreviated'' year by early October.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we can still get a lot done if we start fast and move the
schedule up,'' Lott said. Even so, he laid out only a modest
agenda, including protecting the budget surplus and ending the
so-called marriage penalty that raises income taxes for some
couples.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer days doesn't necessarily mean fewer accomplishments,
insisted John Feerhery, spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill. ``We intend to be high on the accomplishment meter,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among Democrats, House minority leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri
has expressed hopes for bipartisan action on a variety of tax
breaks, tighter gun controls and a prescription drug benefit for
senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   But for both parties, the push to pass legislation could be
offset by angling for the best position for next November's
elections, when the White House and both houses of Congress will be
up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House Democrats, in particular, don't want Republicans to
achieve legislative successes,'' Wittmann said. ``And the
Republicans don't want to do anything that will upset the political
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the incredible shrinking Washington,'' he said. ``Do no
harm is the first rule of medicine, and right now, it's the number
one rule for Washington.''

&HT;     RETIREMENT MAY NOT BE A BAD MOVE FOR RAMS COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RAY RATTO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is considered bad form to push a person of
accomplishment out the door even before the caterers have finished
packing up the champagne.
</P>
<P>
   It is particularly bad form to do it when that person has waited
so long for his moment and has had barely a day to bask in its
sunny glow.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it seems so obvious, at least to us sensible folk, that
Dick Vermeil has been handed a glorious opportunity to do what so
few men in his position have ever managed _ to leave on top, his
legacy assured and set in titanium, never again to be tarnished by
the mundane issues of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Like, how to take the St. Louis Rams one rung higher when he
already is standing at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil has said since the moment he elevated offensive
coordinator Mike Martz to head coach presumptive that he wanted to
put in at least one more year before finding his bliss.
</P>
<P>
   That was before Sunday night, arguably the best Super Bowl of
them all.
</P>
<P>
   Now he gets to ask himself the best question of all _ Is it OK
to go out on top? ``If I said I was absolutely going to come back
and then I didn't,'' he said Monday, ``then you'd say, `Well, you
lying son of a gun, you told us ...' So if I don't tell you
anything, then I can't be trapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Trapped? Are you kidding? Who's going to trap Dick Vermeil now?
It would be trying to catch a bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is good reason for him to do what Vince Lombardi did,
what his friend Bill Walsh did _ go when the going's good. Now both
of them came back to it later to less success, but Vermeil has
already done that. This was his comeback, and he managed to outdo
himself, which only Casey Stengel has managed previously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not like how I finished my career in 1982,'' Vermeil
said, referring to his famous burnout stage at the Philadelphia
Eagles. ``I left not being the football coach that I thought I was,
prior to 1982. I got way too intense, too narrow in vision, way too
emotional, and I did not enjoy the wins, and the losses devastated
me to the point where if we lost a ballgame it would be a downhill
roll in that I couldn't do a good job preparing my team to win the
next one because I couldn't get over the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left because I could not face the football team.''
</P>
<P>
   That is no longer the issue. He modified his emotions. He
delegated. He stopped micromanaging. He has a Super Bowl ring and
he has it with a team that hadn't won a championship since 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Therein, though, lies another good reason to go while the
getting is fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson we all take from the 1999 season is that parity has
finally achieved its ultimate goal _ a Super Bowl made up almost
entirely of newcomers. And there will be more. The salary cap. The
downfalls of your hardy perennials, like Dallas and Oakland and
Minnesota. The ever-lowering standard of owners, who in their
infinite patience are setting as their primary franchise goals the
winning of Super Bowls already played.
</P>
<P>
   This is, quite frankly, a rotten time to be a head coach,
especially one with nothing left to prove, no critic left to rebut.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The telling quote is this one, about the tenuous future of Trent
Green, the man who could have been Kurt Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things are to be defined by John Shaw and Jay Zygmunt,''
Vermeil said. ``They are both lawyers and accountants and ...''
</P>
<P>
   Say no more. The modern NFL is way too much lawyers and
accountants and owners who think themselves the ultimate
competitors. Dick Vermeil managed to become that rarest of
creatures _ an old-school coach who adapted himself to the modern
corporate football. But that doesn't mean he has to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil said he didn't quit after last year's 4-12 season
because he didn't want to go out that way. That's no longer an
issue. He flew to Missouri Monday to do a little hard basking next
to owner Georgia Frontiere and ... well, that's another reason to
move on, but a story for another time.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people will jockey in the next few weeks and months for
the credit that comes with Super Bowl championships. Dick Vermeil
doesn't have to do that, and in retirement will be clear of the
sniping and backbiting that comes with sudden success.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he could coach those last two years, but why bother?
When you hit the lottery, you retire. You don't keep playing the
scratchers.

SALSA, PESTO OR THIS SAUCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Occasionally I come across a culinary combination so obvious
that I marvel at how I could have missed it for so long. This was
certainly the case with the dipping sauce of oil, scallions, ginger
and salt that I had in two Cantonese restaurants recently.
</P>
<P>
   The first time, it was served with chicken that had been
steamed, then lightly dressed with soy sauce and sesame oil. The
second time, it was brought to the table at my host's request, so
that he could demonstrate its usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   This is a simple but powerful sauce, an Asian equivalent of
salsa or pesto. It radically changes the character of anything it
touches, whether it's soup or a bowl of noodles with meat sauce.
But also like salsa or pesto, this sauce is actually best reserved
for the simplest, mildest dishes, those with little flavor of their
own, like these steamed chicken breasts. Only steamed white fish
would showcase the sauce more.
</P>
<P>
   To make this sauce, you just mince ginger, and combine it with
chopped scallions, a neutral oil and plenty of salt. The process is
a tiny bit faster and easier if you puree the ginger and oil in a
blender, then pulse in the scallion. But this makes the sauce
creamy, almost muddy; it's much more attractive when the ginger and
scallions are chopped by hand.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, my recipe makes half a cup of this pungent
sauce, but it can easily be doubled. The sauce will keep for days
in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   I like to steam chicken breasts on the bone because they stay
moist and a little more flavorful than boneless breasts, which cook
about five minutes faster. I also like to leave the skin on, which
insulates the meat, but you can use skinless breasts. If you don't
have a steamer, just put a rack into a pot with a lid and add water
to a level just shy of the bottom of the rack. The chicken can sit
directly on the rack or on a plate placed on the rack.
</P>
<P>
   For the neutral oil, grape seed or canola are the best choices,
although safflower, corn or light olive oil are all acceptable.
Just be sure it smells fresh before you use it. (If you don't go
through oils quickly, they can go rancid unless refrigerated.)
</P>
<P>
   Splashes of soy sauce and nutty-tasting sesame oil add another
level of flavor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STEAMED CHICKEN WITH SCALLION-GINGER SAUCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Time: 20 minutes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   4 chicken breast halves, bone in or out
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon peeled and minced ginger
</P>
<P>
   { cup neutral oil, like canola or grape seed
</P>
<P>
   \ cup trimmed scallions, white and green parts combined, chopped
into \-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons good soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   1. Steam the chicken over simmering water: 6 to 10 minutes for
boneless breasts, 10 to 15 for bone-in. The chicken is done when
white and firm to the touch; cut into a piece if you want to be
certain.
</P>
<P>
   2. Meanwhile, stir together the ginger, oil, scallions and salt
in a bowl. The mixture should be quite strong; you can add more
ginger, scallions or salt if you like. 3. When the chicken is done,
drizzle it with the soy sauce and sesame oil, and serve. Pass the
scallion-ginger sauce at the table, or divide it into four small
bowls for dipping.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

 &HT;    Parents can take steps to keep children safe from firearms in
other homes
 &HT;    (Resending for those who need it.)
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When Linda Blanford's new next-door neighbors
moved in last summer, she was glad the family had young children
who could play with her three kids, ages 4, 7 and 11.
</P>
<P>
   But Blanford also knew the household would contain a potential
danger _ a handgun. After all, the father was a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was working up the courage to ask ``the big
question,'' said Blanford. She waited until her neighbor was mowing
his lawn one day and said to him, ``I was just wondering where you
keep your gun, and whether it's loaded.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanford said her neighbor's answer was polite but not very
reassuring. ``He said his kids know not to touch it, but I couldn't
go with that. To me, it wasn't worth the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanford allows her children to visit inside the home only when
the father, and his gun, are at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this seems a little paranoid,'' she said, ``but I just
started thinking, gosh, anywhere your kids go, you don't know who
has a gun and who doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Paranoid? Child-safety experts say absolutely not. Chances are
50-50 that the home your child is visiting has a firearm, according
to national surveys. Every day, an estimated 13 children die from
gunfire in the United States, making it the second-leading cause of
death among those younger than 19.
</P>
<P>
   And for every child killed by a gun, four others are seriously
wounded, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Given those frightening numbers, says Julie Stucke, a pediatric
psychologist at Children's Medical Center in Dayton, ``it's very
appropriate ... to ask the family of your child's friend or
neighbor if they have a gun in the house and what safety
precautions they take.''
</P>
<P>
   The questioning doesn't have to be confrontational, she said.
``You can say, `I know there have been a lot of shootings lately,
or I've read a lot about kids being hurt by guns.' It's just a
concern _ not that you think the parents are irresponsible or allow
children to play with guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ellen Rome, head of adolescent medicine at the Cleveland
Clinic, says parents shouldn't just drop their kids off at a
friend's or neighbor's home. They should go in and meet the
parents, and strike up a conversation to find out their views on
gun safety, teen alcohol use and other risk factors for children.
</P>
<P>
   If that seems too pushy, ``you can always dump the blame on your
pediatrician,'' Rome said. ``Tell them, `Boy, my pediatrician says
I need to be less naive and more aware about community attitudes on
guns. What's your view on guns in the household?'''
</P>
<P>
   Or ask the parents how they broach the subject of gun safety
with their own children. ``That way you're empowering another
parent rather than being offensive,'' Rome said.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Stucke said, parents should teach their children
about gun safety at the earliest possible age, perhaps when they
are still toddlers. Parents can start by telling children not to
point play guns at each other. Children also should be told that,
when they find a real gun, they should never touch it and
immediately tell an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Kids should be instructed in gun safety ``probably from age 3
on, if not sooner, because they are often watching TV shows where
there are guns, or hearing about them from friends,'' Stucke said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents should make clear to young children that TV and movie
violence is fantasy, and that real guns can do terrifying harm.
``Using developmentally appropriate language, you have to tell them
that guns are dangerous, that they can hurt people, that they can
even kill people,'' Stucke said.
</P>
<P>
   For a toddler or 3-year-old who doesn't understand words such as
dangerous or death, ``you might say the gun can make a really big
ouchie,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Before a sleepover, parents can do some role-playing with their
young children about what they should do if they see a gun in the
home or if their friend brings one out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about how you don't touch the gun. Or how you get out of
the room. Or maybe have them call Mom or Dad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Child-safety advocates say it's always safest not to keep
firearms in the house. But at the very least, guns should be
unloaded and locked, and ammunition stored and locked separately.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, there are no guarantees when it comes to children.
``The more you say `no,' the more it seems like forbidden fruit,''
Rome said. As for locks and hiding places, ``kids can figure these
things out.''
</P>
<P>
   In many inner-city neighborhoods, Rome says, teen-agers often
feel the need to carry a gun or knife for protection. Statistics
show, however, that carrying a weapon is a prime risk factor for
being hurt or killed by one.
</P>
<P>
   Among children and youths age 19 and younger, 84 percent of
firearm deaths occur in the home, according to the American Academy
of Pediatrics. And when a youth fires a gun at home, the victim
most often will be the youth himself (35 percent), a friend (34
percent), a sibling (25 percent) or a parent or other relative (6
percent).
</P>
<P>
   Parents shouldn't be shy about asking their children's teen-age
friends if they carry a weapon for protection. If the answer is
yes, Rome said, parents should ``raise the kid's and parent's
awareness that this is not the answer, that there are other ways of
conflict resolution that are more future-directed and
life-protecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents who have a gun in the home should volunteer that
information to the parents of visiting children so that the other
family can make its own decision about gun safety, Rome said.
``That would be the nice thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association and the American Academy of
Pediatrics have both been stumping for tougher federal laws on
firearm safety. The AMA said the need for handgun safety,
especially in households with children, was one of the country's
three biggest health priorities for the new millennium, together
with weight control and an end to smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But with or without tougher gun safety laws, parents must remain
vigilant: guns and children simply don't mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parental awareness is the key,'' Rome said. ``Parents need to
be talking among themselves about these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   TIPS ON KIDS AND GUN SAFETY
</P>
<P>
   Parents who own a gun:
</P>
<P>
   _ Unload it and lock it up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lock and store ammunition separately.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hide keys where children can't find them.
</P>
<P>
   All parents:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask if guns are safely stored at places your children visit or
play.
</P>
<P>
   _ Talk with your children about guns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teach young children not to touch guns and to tell an adult if
they find one.

 &HT;    FUNDING UP, SPENDING DOWN FOR SCHOOL TECHNOLOGY
 &HT;    (Resending from this weekend for those who need it.)
 &HT;    With TECH-CHART. 670&AMP;add.
 &HT;    With photos.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ A bewildering array of public and private funders
is pumping roughly $7 billion a year into educational technology
for the nation's schools.
</P>
<P>
   Yet spending on technology by public schools, which exceeded
$142 per student in the 1998-99 school year, is on track to drop to
as low as $133 per student this year, according to a recent report
from Quality Education Data.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the trend is natural: Spending on computers and other
hardware is dropping by $13 per student as the most tech-savvy
districts finish the process of installing on-line data connections
in every classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpectedly, that drop was only partly offset by increased
spending on software purchases, support, training and related
costs.
</P>
<P>
   At a time of unprecedented national prosperity, many educators
expected much bigger spending increases for using technology to
raise student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the drop may be explained by the increasing reliance of
schools on technology partnerships with local businesses, community
groups and youth agencies, where the spending shows up only on the
other partners' books.
</P>
<P>
   But many public school supporters think there's another reason:
groups with better skills in ``grantsmanship'' are acing out the
public schools in the intense competition for technology funds.
These include universities, libraries, research groups and private
for-profit or nonprofit researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people, including teachers and principals, get
confused. They can't figure the system out,'' said Robert Cooke of
Boca Raton, Fla. As grants coordinator for the police department in
nearby Fort Lauderdale, he has raised funds for more than 20
programs run by his department, other city departments, youth
agencies and the local schools.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools compete fiercely for funds from a handful of
well-known programs, such as foundations run by brand-name
technology companies such as America Online, BellSouth, MCI
Worldcom and Microsoft. Meanwhile, other, lesser-known foundations
get too few requests from schools for technology funds, even though
many local foundations are flush with stock-market gains and
required by the IRS to give away a sum equal to 5 percent of their
assets each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if there is an extra billion dollars
available out there for every two billion dollars that is put to
use,'' Cooke said.
</P>
<P>
   He was part of an overflow crowd of more than 500 participants,
mostly teachers and principals, who paid up to $495 apiece for a
cram course here Thursday and Friday on grant-getting skills.
</P>
<P>
   Many have high hopes. A survey of graduates of last year's
seminar showed they raised an average of $7 million apiece last
year for education technology, said Gregg Downey, editor and
publisher of eSchool (cq) News. The monthly publication for
educators interested in technology trends sponsored the seminar.
</P>
<P>
   Some came with detailed questions about how they could squeeze
more money out of the nation's biggest single source of educational
technology money, the e-rate, which is funded from the ``universal
service'' surcharge on everyone's telephone bill.
</P>
<P>
   Their prospects are mixed, said Kate Moore, president of the
schools and library division of the non-profit company formed by
the Federal Communications Commission to distribute e-rate funds.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that, after distributing just under $1.96
billion last year, her e-rate agency hopes to give out $2.25
billion in each of the next two years. And the application process,
which baffled some educators and infuriated others, has been
simplified, though many restrictions on the use of such funds are
necessary under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that there's more competition. By this month's
deadline, Moore's division had received 36,000 applications from
schools, districts and libraries, up from 32,000 last year. And a
single big school system, the Los Angeles Unified School District,
has applied for $450 million, or 20 percent of the funds.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   E-rate funds are especially important to poor regions because,
the funds can help leverage other grants, said Cathey(cq) George, a
teacher in the La Vega Independent School District near Waco,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Her district is so poor that more than 80 percent of its 2,500
students qualify for free or reduced-price school lunches. But with
the help of e-rate funds, it just finished installing a $500,000
wireless network with ultra-speedy connections.
</P>
<P>
   All classrooms have several computers linked to the Internet,
all teachers have e-mail accounts, parents can get school news and
see homework assignments on a Web site, and video conferences can
be transmitted from the high school's multimedia lab to all other
school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   To finance it, George matched a $400,000 e-rate grant with a
$100,000 state grant, which she matched with $10,000 in local funds
that included donations and unspent funds she found in a textbook
account.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of three microwave towers, which couldn't be paid for
with e-rate funds, will be offset within two years by related
savings on the district's telecommunications bills, since it won't
have to lease high-speed T1 telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandparents can be your secret weapon'' in convincing school
boards to allow imaginative financial schemes, George told her
fellow teachers. With so many parents working one or two jobs,
grandparents ``are the ones with the time to show up and tell the
school board they want the very best for their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Few new competitive grants will be awarded by the U.S.
Department of Education this year, even though its technology
grants have grown from $82 billion in 1996 to $789 billion this
year, indicated Julie Kaminkow of the department's office of
educational technology.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the money will go to the states, which will hold
their own competitions. Much of the rest is being used to fund
runners-up from last year's competitions, in some of which the
losers outnumbered the winners by 20 to one. In addition, in some
cases where Congress increased funding, influential lawmakers
earmarked the new money for their own constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, the lecturers told the grant-seekers that they
would have a better chance of getting funds if they joined in
partnerships with local businesses, volunteer groups, youth
agencies or institutions of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tap your existing outside support systems first,'' urged Jill
Stephens, director of the AOL Foundation's day-to-day activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure you give them all credit,'' advised Glenn Jones, a
former Atlanta educator who now is principal of a high school in
Washington, D.C. In a local experiment, the AOL Foundation sets
aside a $500 college scholarship each semester for any student in
his school whose lowest grade is an A or a B.
</P>
<P>
   He had to reassure some of the school's other business partners
``who started to get jealous'' when the big AOL program started at
his school. ``The politics of this job never ceases to amaze me,''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Especially in remote areas, it makes no sense for schools,
police or sheriff's departments and fire departments to try to fund
separate data networks, said Judy Isom, a board member of the Rural
Technology Foundation in Bessemer, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools need the Internet, and the law and fire forces need
redundant capacity to back up their phone lines,'' she said.
``Partnerships are the way to go.''

 &HT;    YEARS AFTER INTIFADA, ISRAELIS RETURNING TO OLD CITY
 &HT;    (Resending for those who need it.)
 &HT;    With Photo.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ These days, Israeli Yael Boksenboin(cq) can visit
Jerusalem's Old City like a tourist: With her toddler daughter and
without the rifle she used to carry.
</P>
<P>
   She was a soldier here during the Palestinian Intifada uprising
that swept the region 10 years ago. Then, this tourist haven _ an
ancient walled district in downtown Jerusalem _ was the scene of
frequent attacks on Jews by Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   There was a permanent Israeli presence in the small Jewish
Quarter. But most Israelis stopped their frequent shopping or
dining excursions to the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   When the Intifada ended in 1993, the fear remained. So did
Israeli troops, stationed along the narrow streets.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the last year, Israelis have been rediscovering the Old
City. Especially on Saturdays, Hebrew can be heard sprinkled among
the Spanish, English and Italian of the foreign sightseers and the
Arabic of the locals.
</P>
<P>
   When Boksenboin, a 30-year-old lawyer, visited a couple months
ago, it was the first time in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   She strolled by the Western Wall, sacred to Jews. She took in
the scents of the bazaar's spices and hummus, which she recalled
from her visits as a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I was here I was a soldier and I walked with a
gun,'' she said. ``I don't have to look behind my back like I used
to. It's feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why Israelis are returning now is not clear. People cite
the current rarity of political violence. Some say that progress in
the peace process makes them feel more at ease among Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Israelis are feeling more at home in the
heart of their cherished, yet disputed, capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good sign,'' says Israeli Meron Benvenisti, who
was a top city official during the Intifada and saw the decline in
Israeli visits to the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to define the whole thing as the geography of fear.
People are overcoming the fear,'' said Benvenisti, whose book
``City of Stone'' describes the city's ethnic tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis still rarely venture into other Arab areas of
Jerusalem. Benvenisti is skeptical that the political climate is
responsible for their return to the Old City. He said that the lack
of recent violence has prompted Israelis to simply rediscover a
delight they had missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real a phenomenon,'' said Israeli tour guide Doron Bar,
who was leading a group of Israelis recently.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, the group toured China. With Bar, they were
visiting the Old City's Church of the Holy Sepulcher, believed by
many to be the site of Christ's crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit may belong to an exhibit of works from
American glass sculptor Dale Chihuly. Opened in July in a museum
garden just inside the Old City walls, it has sold nearly 700,000
tickets to foreigners and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   From the exhibit, many venture further to Old City shops and
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The stone streets of the Old City, which is less than a square
mile in area and dates back more than 3,000 years, are lined by
more than 3,000 shops. They sell everything from tacky tourist
T-shirts to the meat, vegetables and clothes used by the locals.
They also offer fine jewelry, pottery and carpets from throughout
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Around the shops live the residents. The large Moslem Quarter is
home for more than 20,000 Palestinians. The Christian Quarter is
also mostly Palestinian. There are smaller Armenian and Jewish
Quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Israel took total control over the Old City when it captured it
from the Jordanians in 1967. Palestinians seek to govern their own
affairs there and most countries officially consider the matter up
for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian merchants seem pleased to see Israeli shoppers
returning.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Palestinian Adel Kawasmi has seen the return of a few
Israelis who came to his shop regularly before the Intifada. They
would share tea and buy his glass bowls and drinking glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are happy to see them here, of course,'' he said. ``The
business is much better.''
</P>
<P>
   And Israelis don't mind that Arab merchants have commercial
motives for wanting them back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt really welcome. They all said, 'Please come in,'''
said Anat Inbar, a 24-year-old television producer. ``I know it's
for economic reasons, but that's good. That's normal life.''

SESAME FLATBREADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (This is the fifth of eight columns by Tadashi Ono, the chef at
Sono in Manhattan. They are written with Mark Bittman.) 
 (jt) 
 By TADASHI ONO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When we were planning our menu at Sono, one big
decision had to be made about what to offer people while they were
waiting to order their meals. We wanted to serve something like
bread, but not the usual sourdough, because of the Japanese
overtones on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, a starchy food would never be served until the end of
the meal. Starches are considered inexpensive fillers, which only
reduce people's appetites and their full appreciation of the main
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, though, people expect bread when they sit down in a
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   So my pastry chef, Christine Chang, and I came up with a
paper-thin crunchy flatbread. It has a lot in common with both
Indian papadum and Japanese rice crackers, but it is a bread with
no real roots, a supercrisp cracker that is fun to eat. We serve
large irregular sheets of the flatbread arranged vertically in a
holder so that diners can break off crunchy bits to nibble.
</P>
<P>
   The bread is made with a plain dough of white flour and water,
which is easily put together by hand or in a mixer or a food
processor. It can be flavored in many ways. We most often use
sesame seeds, a mixture of black and white as in the recipe below.
They add a little extra crunch, along with flavoring. At other
times, we add dried shiso, which tastes a little like minty basil;
dried crumbled nori; or curry powder.
</P>
<P>
   You could also try saffron, which would lend the dough a
beautiful color, or anise, or ground cardamom or cumin, or any
combination. We serve the flatbreads on their own, but you could
serve them with a dip, like miso thinned with a little white wine,
or a mayonnaise flavored with soy sauce.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a delicate dough, and it need not be handled
carefully. It just has to be allowed to rest thoroughly after it is
mixed and before it is rolled out, so that it relaxes. To roll it
out, you can use either a rolling pin or a pasta machine.
</P>
<P>
   Once the dough is laid on a baking sheet, you can stretch it out
even thinner before baking it.
</P>
<P>
   Since this recipe makes six large sheets, you can freeze extra
dough for as long as a couple of weeks if you like. Defrost it in
the refrigerator overnight before rolling it out.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SESAME FLATBREADS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Time: 1 hour, plus at least 2 hours' chilling &LR;
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   { tablespoon sesame seeds, preferably white and black mixed
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lime juice
</P>
<P>
   1{ tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1. The dough can be made by hand, in a mixer equipped with a
dough hook or in a food processor. By hand or with a mixer, mix the
dry ingredients together in a bowl. Stir in the lime juice and
olive oil, then gradually add about } cup of water, mixing well
until you have a fairly sticky but not too soft dough. Knead until
the dough is smooth and elastic, using as little additional flour
as possible. The dough should be somewhat sticky, like pizza dough.
</P>
<P>
   To make the dough in a food processor, combine the flour, sugar,
salt, lime juice and olive oil, and pulse once or twice. With the
machine on, gradually add about } cup water, enough to make the
dough gather into a ball. Process for 15 seconds or so longer, then
knead sesame seeds in by hand, with as little additional flour as
possible. Dough should be somewhat sticky, like pizza dough.
</P>
<P>
   2. Gather dough into a ball, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate at
least a couple of hours, preferably overnight.
</P>
<P>
   3. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Cut dough into six pieces, and
rewrap five of them. Roll out remaining piece, with pasta machine
or rolling pin on lightly floured surface, until dough is as thin
as possible without tearing it. Rolling with a pin will leave edges
thicker than the center. (Irregularities of thickness are a
pleasant feature). Put dough on dry cookie sheet, stretching it as
much as you can and anchoring edges by pressing them to sheet. If
small tears occur, ignore them. (Patch large tears or start over.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Bake 10 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Break into
pieces, and eat immediately. You can bake the breads all at once or
store the remaining dough in a cool, dry place for several days.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 flatbreads.

 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A fifth columnist has infiltrated the menus of
Manhattan. It has a deceptively attractive name, so close to
another French name that it passes almost unnoticed by most diners.
Once on the plate, it has already undergone a metamorphosis, so its
identity remains obscure. The time has come to unmask it.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit is something called a crepinette. It sounds as if it
might be a little crepe, and I'm willing to bet that most diners
who order one think that a crepe is what they are getting. After
the first bite, it's too late. The thing is irresistible. Once you
find out that the word is derived from crepine, or caul fat, you're
in way too deep to turn back.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, a crepine is the lacy membrane encasing a pig's intestine.
And no, it's neither more nor less than fat, the most-feared word
in the culinary vocabulary. But in the hands of the right chef, and
stuffed with the right ingredients, this rock-bottom, low-peasant
article, which comes to the kitchen in a big folded heap like a
used dishcloth, can rise to dizzying heights.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about a sheet of fat. It makes chefs want to
reach for fringe meats, intense braising liquids and viscous
stocks. The crepinettes I've come across in New York may be the
richest, most flavorful mouthfuls that money can buy.
</P>
<P>
   It was at Palladin that I underwent a crepinette conversion. The
executive chef, Jean-Louis Palladin, comes from Gascony, and as a
young chef in Condom, he drove to Bordeaux for a lot of his
supplies, which means he spent his formative years deep in
crepinette territory.
</P>
<P>
   At his Manhattan restaurant, Palladin, who had been fiddling
around with various civets and daubes, decided to create a
crepinette to end all crepinettes, a Gascon tour de force of seared
foie gras, sweetbreads and wine-braised oxtail, bound with chicken
mousse, packed tightly into a square of caul fat and grilled. Lest
anyone miss the point, Palladin thoughtfully added a marrow flan.
</P>
<P>
   One bite into the Palladin crepinette, which oozed a rich syrup
of veal stock and red wine, and I was ready to sell my soul to the
devil for the second bite. Marlowe's ``infinite riches in a little
room'' had come to life before me in edible form. As it turned out,
it was only the first in a series of memorable crepinette
encounters. But I'm getting ahead of myself.
</P>
<P>
   The crepinette, a kind of primitive sausage, is probably as old
as the pig, and the simplest versions are little more than
seasoned, finely chopped pork meat and offal tucked into a square
of caul fat and grilled.
</P>
<P>
   In France, crepinettes have generally been made of pork mixed
with chopped parsley, but there are versions using veal, lamb,
poultry or even fish. (One of the first crepinettes I encountered,
in the Languedoc region of France, was stuffed with cod and
spinach.) Some are dipped in bread crumbs before grilling, sauteing
or baking.
</P>
<P>
   During cooking, the caul fat browns and allows the exterior
layer of meat to develop a crust. The caul wrapper emerges as a
transparent, slightly sticky skin, barely there, but profound in
its effects. ``Just the melting of the fat into the braising liquid
or sauce gives it, not a taste, but a mouth feel,'' said David
Waltuck, the chef at Chanterelle.
</P>
<P>
   For hundreds of years, the crepinette was a workaday dish,
served with pureed potatoes. Then, in the 19th century, the
mandarins of haute cuisine elevated it, lavishing truffles and wine
sauces on fancy meats like partridge before enrobing them with the
humble crepine.
</P>
<P>
   Escoffier offers a tempting crepinette that starts with sausage
meat but quickly loads on the extras: chopped truffles and truffle
liquid are added to the meat, and a Perigueux sauce, rich with
truffled Madeira and sherry, is ladled over the top.
</P>
<P>
   Different regions have their own variations. A classic dish in
the Gironde is a crepinette stuffed with pork-sausage meat, grilled
in butter and served with an oyster on the half-shell. At his Las
Vegas restaurant, Napa, Palladin turned the dish inside out,
putting a Belon oyster inside the crepinette.
</P>
<P>
   In Provence, crepinettes known as gayettes are stuffed with pork
liver and fresh bacon. When cooked, they look like little quails,
or caillettes, hence the name.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the ingredients, the caul fat does its magic work,
seeping into the interior and enriching the stew within, but
retaining just enough tensile strength to hold the package
together.
</P>
<P>
   In England, the traditional food known as a faggot can still be
found in the Midlands, the south and Wales. Made of cooked pork and
offal, mixed with onions, garlic, sage and mace, and often rolled
in bread crumbs, it has been served hot or cold for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was a careless cook in Pudding Lane who started the
Great Fire of London in 1666, when a batch went out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the faggot nor the crepinette made it across the
Atlantic. We have no crepinette tradition. But that doesn't mean
that there are not superior crepinettes to be found.
</P>
<P>
   The chef at Peacock Alley, Laurent Gras, is a longtime student
of the crepinette. When cooking under Alain Senderens in France, he
made fish crepinettes with thyme and rosemary. At the Waldorf, he
has created a daunting crepinette stuffed with pigs'-foot meat,
sweetbreads braised in white wine, short ribs and a truffled
Madeira sauce.
</P>
<P>
   It is a flavorful morsel. Like Palladin, Gras couldn't quite
stop with a bare crepinette. His comes with a large, flat square of
pasta coated with a cream reduction.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little more surprising to run across a crepinette at
Little Dove. This time, it was stuffed with guinea hen mixed with
celery root, carrot and fennel. At La Fourchette, the chef Marc
Murphy pulls no punches, returning the crepinette to its deep
roots, with a stuffing of sweetbreads, veal brains, diced bacon and
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   At Chanterelle, the crepinette has been an on-again, off-again
player. Waltuck has done a crepinette of sweetbreads wrapped in
spinach and an unusual treatment borrowed from Alain Chapel, in
which the meat end of a rib lamb chop is covered in braised,
julienned vegetables and tarragon, then encased in caul fat.
</P>
<P>
   As a selling term, caul fat is a nonstarter. It could probably
clear a restaurant faster than a fire alarm. But thanks to the
lovely, euphonious word crepinette, the city's diners have been
feasting without guilt on the ingredient that dares not speak its
name.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Yorkers say they're afraid of fat,'' Waltuck said, ``but
when they get it, they like it.'' Just call it something else. &QL;

&HT;     GOLF AT PEBBLE BEACH AS A SPECTATOR EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SUSAN FORNOFF  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ The AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am
stands alone among golf tournaments in that it attracts hordes of
fans who aren't the least bit interested in the game.
</P>
<P>
   They're more interested in stalking game _ movie stars,
comedians, football heroes _ for autographs, handshakes or just a
little interaction, a hint at the real man behind the mask. (And we
mean men, because for the first time since 1996 the Pro-Am field is
female-unfriendly.)
</P>
<P>
   These celebrity decoys are actually a good thing, because with
thousands of people converging on 54 golf holes, it would be a
disaster if everyone wanted to follow Tiger Woods or David Duval.
Especially this year, when _ before the weather forecasters played
spoiler _ record crowds were expected, attracted by a
record-caliber field that included the top 10 money winners of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never sold out,'' executive vice president Ollie J.
Nutt, the tournament's director, said last week. ``Typically,
tickets are sold on-site right through Sunday. However, with the
tremendous demand this year, we have placed a limit on the number
of tickets we will sell to ensure a quality spectator experience.''
</P>
<P>
   A quality spectator experience, eh? There's one to be had at
Pebble Beach this week, even in the rain, if you do some quality
planning and preparation. Here's your primer, courtesy of years as
a golf fan in training to be a golf writer: Think ahead: Plan to
visit on Thursday, before all the weekenders arrive. Wednesday's
sort of confusing _ practice times are to be found only in the pro
shops of the three courses, so you'll need some luck to be in the
right place at the right time to see your favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's OK. But Thursday is best.
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to overnight, don't even try to book a room in
the happening village of Carmel. Prices are doubled for this week
and people tend to go back to the same inn year after year.
Monterey and Pacific Grove are just as accessible to the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In your day pack put: towel or blanket, sandwich and/or energy
bars, corkscrew/opener, beverage of choice, plastic cups and
napkins, sunglasses, gloves (you will not believe how many people
will be jealous that you have these) and your favorite rain suit or
trash bag.
</P>
<P>
   The current Pebble Beach weather forecast calls for showers on
Thursday, Saturday and Sunday, so umbrellas are suggested. Cameras
and cell phones are prohibited, so hide them well. Wear a hat and
your favorite layers.
</P>
<P>
   Consider parking bright and early at the foot of Ocean Avenue in
Carmel. If you take a short walk along the beach, you'll land in
the most beautiful area of the Pebble Beach Golf Links, coming up a
path behind the 10th green. Don't forget to buy a ticket, though.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much fun you had the night before, don't sleep in.
Play starts at 8 a.m. on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, which means
you will want to be making your way through the shuttle system by
7:30. Because play will be over by 4, you will not want to try to
visit more than two courses in a day, or you will spend more time
shuttling and less time watching golf.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise: In shape? There are two strategies here. One is to
walk 18 holes with your favorite foursome. They might even
recognize you when the round has ended and you'll get some easy
autographs. The other is to get as far from the course clubhouse as
you can _ 5-14 at Pebble, 12-16 at Spyglass, 4-8 and 11-15 at
Poppy.
</P>
<P>
   People who are not in shape will congregate at the nearest tees
and greens _ it's much less nuts at the remote areas of the courses
and lines are shorter at the concessions and johns.
</P>
<P>
   Injured? Plant yourself in the bleachers on 18 at Pebble Beach,
or go directly to Spyglass or Poppy Hills. Pebble was built in the
old-fashioned format of nine holes out (away from the Lodge) and
nine holes in, meaning that once you leave the first or last two
holes, you've got to do some walking. And, remember, the shuttle
stop is more walking in the other direction.
</P>
<P>
   At Spyglass or Poppy, you can find at least six prime viewing
areas without walking more than a single hole. The ocean holes at
Spyglass and the dramatic 5th through 10th at Pebble Beach are
great viewing spots for outdoors folks. The ocean hogs up a lot of
gallery space, but the galleries tend to be smaller at these more
distant holes. Plus, you'll hear the waves crashing and the sea
gulls shrieking and the seals barking.
</P>
<P>
   Eat right: Just across from the Lodge at Pebble Beach is the
Pebble Beach Market. Here you'll find great sandwiches and salads,
fresh bread and cheeses, chips and salsa, even some sushi plates.
And there's cold beer, wine and even bubbly. Buy here and head out
to the prettiest spot you can find at Pebble (seventh hole, eighth
green) for the ultimate in ambience.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't think that far ahead, the grilled chicken

   At the end of the day, the Lodge at Pebble Beach is the place to
rest and recoup before the shuttle ride or hike back to your car,
but beware the hefty drink prices. If you can get into the
increasingly exclusive Tap Room there, you're guaranteed to see
some of the celebrities _ Kevin Costner, Tommy Smothers _ who
cannot bear to retire to their rooms in anonymity. Across the hall
is Stillwater, which has a small bar area with great seafood.

<P>
   Go home: The highest quality spectator experience on Sunday,
when the tournament is played only at Pebble Beach, is to be found
on your couch.
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Late entries into the celebrity field includes tennis
star Jimmy Connors and TV stars Ray Romano (``Everybody Loves
Raymond'') and Kevin Sorbo (``Hercules''). ... Tiger Woods will be
paired with some (un)lucky amateur already in the field, whose name
was to be announced on Tuesday. ... Brandi Chastain had to cancel
her appearance at the youth clinic Wednesday due to U.S. Women's
Soccer team business. ... Once again, the celebrity field will be
split among Poppy Hills and Spyglass on Thursday and Friday, with
those wanted by CBS converging at Pebble on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At these more distant holes ... you'll hear the waves crashing
and the sea gulls shrieking and the seals barking.

SYRAH TAKES ROOT IN AMERICA

 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot of people have been credited with being the first to
import the syrah grape to America. Leon D. Adams stated flatly in
``The Wines of America'' (McGraw-Hill, 1978) that it was Howard
Olmo of the University of California at Davis who brought in the
first vines, some 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Others contend that the first syrah vines were to be found a
century earlier in vineyards the pioneer Italian growers in
California called ``mixed black'' _ a jumble of various vines.
</P>
<P>
   No matter who introduced them, or when, the date was hardly
important to the development of American wine. By 1981, there were
only about 80 acres of syrah in all of California. A decade later,
there were still only about 400 acres.
</P>
<P>
   How times have changed. Today, every wine-producing region of
California has syrah vineyards, from Napa and Sonoma to the Sierra
foothills, from Mendocino to San Joaquin to Santa Barbara. Syrahs
are made, too, in Washington State and Virginia. In all, there are
now some 8,000 acres of syrah, of which more than half are already
producing fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Syrah has never threatened cabernet sauvignon or even zinfandel
for dominance in the American market. But in the hands of dedicated
winemakers, including a group calling themselves ``Rhone Rangers,''
syrah has taken its place among the country's most important red
wines.
</P>
<P>
   Syrah is variously described as tasting and smelling of bacon
fat, smoke, saddle leather, pepper, tar, cassis, wild blackberries
and a whole shelf of different spices. When well made, it is a big,
dense wine with enough tannin to support the aggressive flavors.
More than cabernet will ever be, it is a warm-climate wine, which
is of course the climate most of California has.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, there was much confusion as to what exactly _
or even approximately _ constituted syrah. A grape called petite
sirah had been around for a long time, and some people, even
experts, once thought the two were related. Both have backgrounds
in France, but there the syrah is an aristocrat, turning up in
northern Rhone Valley wines like Hermitage, Cote-Rotie and Cornas.
</P>
<P>
   Petite sirah, which may or may not be a grape called durif,
hardly shows its face at all these days, except in California,
where it produces a lively, rustic wine along the lines of
zinfandel.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion between the two surfaced in odd ways. Often,
growers who thought they had been producing syrah discovered it to
be petite sirah when they did scientific testing. But in 1981, the
Keehn family, at McDowell Valley Vineyards in Mendocino County,
discovered that the 36 acres of petite sirah it had been nurturing
for more than a decade was actually syrah. McDowell became one of
the earliest California wineries to specialize in Rhone varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the first California winery to produce a true syrah was
Joseph Phelps Vineyards in the Napa Valley in 1974. Its success led
to a full line of Rhone wines, including grenache, mourvedre and
viognier. Randall Grahm, an early syrah enthusiast and a Rhone
Rangers founder, several years ago saw his syrah vineyard in the
Santa Cruz Mountains destroyed by Pierce's disease, an incurable
bacterial infection.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a variety of good to excellent syrahs are on the market,
but quantities are small and distribution thin. Still, most serious
wine shops will have at least two or three.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Tablas Creek, near Paso Robles, Calif. This is
a long awaited and much discussed joint effort between the Perrin
brothers from the famous Chateau de Beaucastel in
Chateauneuf-du-Pape in France and Robert Haas, an American
importer. It has yet to release a syrah.
</P>
<P>
   Announced in the late 1980s, Tablas Creek planted 13 varieties
of imported Rhone vines and began winemaking trials in 1994. The
first red wine released, in 1996, was a blend of syrah and
mourvedre made mostly from American vines and called simply Tablas
Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 vintage has been made mostly from fruit from the
imported vines. A full-bore syrah is expected soon. It would not be
imprudent to predict that it will be a most creditable wine.
</P>
<P>
   My own favorites include Qupe's 1997 Bien Nacido Vineyard; Alban
Vineyards' 1997 Reva from the Edna Valley; Ojai's 1996 California;
Steele Wines' 1997 Lake County syrah under its second label,
Shooting Star; and, from Edmunds St. John, practically any syrah
that its winemaker, Steven Edmunds, turns out.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the 1996 from Folie a Deux, made with grapes from
Amador County, where big-bodied red wines are what the winemakers
do best. (Folie a Deux is in the Napa Valley, but the winemaker,
Scott Harvey, is from Amador.)
</P>
<P>
   Geyser Peak, in northern Sonoma County, makes a variety of
attractive syrahs, but calls them shiraz, perhaps a holdover from
the early 1990s, when the winery was in a 50-50 partnership with
Penfolds, a big Australian wine producer. Syrah has always been
called shiraz in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   It seems glib to describe syrah as not being cabernet sauvignon,
but that happens to be the case. It's also the most consistent
thing about it. There are many styles of syrah, as anyone familiar
with Rhone wines will readily attest. Hermitage is the classic
benchmark, but it is so dense and slow-developing that practically
the only fair comparison is between a recent California syrah and
an Hermitage 10 years its elder. Perhaps a better comparison is to
a good Cote-Rotie from Chapoutier, Guigal or Rene Rostaing.
</P>
<P>
   Chateauneuf-du-Pape, in spite of the Perrins' interest in
California syrah, is not really analogous. In it, syrah is just a
supporting player, giving needed structure and depth to grenache
and mourvedre.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, syrah fanatics said their favorite would one day
replace cabernet sauvignon and its acolytes, merlot and cabernet
franc, in this country. It never happened, and it probably never
will. But there is absolutely nothing wrong with playing the second
lead, and home-grown syrahs do that extremely well.

   A side from the grape, only the apple has made a name and a
taste for itself among fruit-based alcoholic beverages. Yes, you
can find any number of brandies made from blackberries, peaches and
other fruits, and pear brandy in particular can be beguiling, but
apple brandy stands by itself as a credible alternative to such
exalted grape brandies as Cognac and Armagnac.
</P>
<P>
   The best apple brandy, Calvados, comes from Normandy, where
apples have been grown for more than a millennium. In its rawest
form, Calvados is a fiery dart to the throat, the legendary morning
eye-opener of the French workingman. But long aging can add
refinement and complexity while retaining the fresh apple edge that
makes Calvados so appealing.
</P>
<P>
   To make Calvados, apples are crushed and fermented into cider,
which is then distilled twice. After Calvados is aged in oak casks,
sometimes for as long as 20 years, it is bottled. Prolonged barrel
aging darkens the color; a young Calvados is golden. Aging also
heightens the price, which can range from around $12 to well over
$100 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Special designations like Napoleon, Extra-Old (XO), Hors d'Age
or VSOP can be used to denote age, but are not required. One useful
label phrase to remember is ``Pays d'Auge,'' indicating that apples
from the Auge region, considered the best, were used.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Calvados, several American producers like Clear Creek
in Oregon and Laird's in New Jersey make excellent apple brandies.
</P>
<P>
   Hard cider is another traditional apple drink, not only in
Normandy but in England and the United States as well. Most of the
American ciders I've tasted are overly sweet, but an artisanal,
unpasteurized cider like the Dupont below, with an alcoholic
content similar to beer, is wonderfully refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   These four examples of Calvados are listed in order of
preference, followed by an American apple brandy and a hard cider.

   Even in the most frigid months, ice cream doesn't go into
hibernation. A hot apple tart still comes with a scoop of vanilla.
But pastry chefs do change their focus when eating ice cream
becomes an indoor sport.
</P>
<P>
   The heartier food of winter all but demands more intense
desserts with rich and creamy texture, like a big bowl of ice cream
made with anything but strawberries or plain vanilla. These days,
seasonal ingredients are coming more into play, particularly
toasted nuts, heady spices, dried fruit and even wines and a winter
vegetable or two. The results are almost warming.
</P>
<P>
   Adding alcohol, whether zinfandel or rum, to ice cream enhances
both flavor and texture. Alcohol lowers the freezing point, so ice
creams stay creamier and smoother because they do not freeze as
solid and are less likely to form ice crystals.
</P>
<P>
   Too much alcohol can prevent ice cream from freezing at all. A
rule of thumb is to add one and a half tablespoons of 80-proof
alcohol for every quart of ice cream base. Experiment with a plain
vanilla base till you get the flavor you like; a dark rum will have
more flavor than a light rum, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Some pastry chefs mix in small amounts of alcohol to add nuances
to other flavors, like a few drops of poire William in a pear ice
cream. Others pour with a freer hand. Alana Ford of Tapika makes
two alcohol-enriched ice creams, amaretto and bourbon, that have
clear and potent flavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In winter, I try to use spirits because they seem to take the
chill off the ice cream,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Guier of Vox makes a mauve mulled-wine ice cream, a kir
royale variation of Champagne ice cream with a cassis swirl and
even a tequila ice cream. ``I think because the ice creams don't
freeze as hard, their flavors are more accessible, and this lets
you taste familiar wines and liquors in an unfamiliar way,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At Morrell Wine Bar and Cafe, a flight of ice creams flavored
with dessert wines is served with a corresponding glass of each
wine, like Sauternes, vin santo and muscat. Egg Dairy Farm, in
Peekskill, N.Y., makes the ice creams, which are intended to show
off the differences in flavor in the wines.
</P>
<P>
   George McKirdy of Heartbeat said that he uses alcohol in ice
cream in the winter because people tend to eat and drink more this
time of year than in summer. He infuses marzipan and blanched
ground almonds in cream, and spikes it with rum and brandy in an
ice cream with walnuts, raisins and figs.
</P>
<P>
   The classic rum raisin model inspires other winter ice creams.
Macerating dried fruits makes them plump and tender, as in prune
Armagnac ice cream. The alcohol keeps the dried fruit from turning
into ice chunks, as fresh sliced peaches would.
</P>
<P>
   Dalia Jurgensen of Quantum 56 cooks figs with honey, brandy and
spices, swirling them into an ice cream base. Heather Carlucci of
Jack's Fifth adds dried cherries and figs to Armagnac ice cream.
And at Rue 57, Colleen Grapes flavors dried-cherry ice cream with
Estrella, a cherry-flavored liqueur.
</P>
<P>
   Even without maceration, dried fruits and nuts are typical
winter flavors. Scott Campbell, the chef of Avenue, uses praline
pecans in his maple ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Spices are just as much a hallmark of winter ice creams. At La
Fourchette, Marc Murphy, the chef, simmers rice in milk studded
with cinnamon sticks, and churns that into a custard. At Vong,
Serge Decrauzat makes an ice cream with mace, black pepper and
cardamom. At Aquavit, Marcus Samuelsson, the chef, serves a
slightly savory curry ice cream that is not as odd as it sounds;
the spices are a combination of sweet, like cloves, cinnamon and
ginger, and savory, like cumin, coriander, turmeric and fennel. At
Gramercy Tavern, Claudia Fleming makes a peppery gingersnap ice
cream, not with crushed cookies but with the spices that
characterize them. And she sometimes tops it with caramelized blood
oranges, one of the few seasonal fruits this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   And still other pastry chefs just reach into the vegetable bin.
Sweet potatoes and pumpkins have been made into pies for centuries,
indicating how adaptable they are to ice cream. Pumpkin ice cream
has become practically a frozen cliche, but Jurgensen of Quantum 56
does a variation that tastes much fresher. Her sweet potato ice
cream is delicately flavored with vanilla and then studded with
soft homemade marshmallows, a takeoff on the candied yams of
Thanksgiving but much less sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Samuelsson even makes a carrot ice cream. He first makes a sweet
carrot granita by freezing sweetened carrot juice, and then he
swirls it into a sour cream custard base. The result looks a bit
like a melted orange candy cane but has a tangy-sweet flavor from
the sour cream.

   3. To make the base, in small saucepan, bring cream and
one-third cup sugar to simmer. In bowl, whisk together yolks and
remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.

   4. Remove cream from heat, and add a little to yolk mixture to
warm it, stirring constantly to keep yolks from curdling. Pour yolk
mixture into hot cream, stirring cream constantly as you pour.

   5. Return custard to stove; cook over low heat, stirring
constantly with wooden spoon until it thickens enough to coat back

cool, and then combine with mulled wine. Chill until cold, for at
least 4 hours. Freeze in ice cream maker according to
manufacturer's instructions.

   UNDATED _ From the TV show to the movie to the Cartman coffee
mugs you can pick up at the dollar store, there's just no avoiding
South Park. So until the next offensive cartoon that kids love and
parents loathe comes along, get used to this one. South Park has
already invaded the video-game world via a string of titles, none
of which are hardly worth remembering, much less buying. But
Acclaim and Comedy Central have teamed up for the quite amusing
South Park Rally ($55), one of this winter's most anticipated
PlayStation titles. And before I begin the praising, I gotta warn
parents: It's just like the show, full of potty-mouth language.
Think twice, in other words, before you buy this for your

meticulous plans for how to respond when the awful news comes in
that one of its planes has gone down. And within moments of hearing
that Flight 261 had plunged into the Pacific Ocean northwest of Los
Angeles, Alaska Airlines called in the grief counselors and put its
``critical incident response team'' to work, ready to console the
distraught relatives and friends of the missing passengers. But to
an unusual degree, the Alaska Airlines team also wound up
ministering to itself pn Tuesday. Passenger records indicate that
at least 35 of the 88 people believed dead in the crash off the

   EPISCOPAL-BISHOPS (Undated) _ In an extraordinary challenge to
the leadership of the Episcopal Church, the top officials of two
Anglican church provinces overseas _ in Central Africa and
Southeast Asia _ have consecrated two American priests as bishops
to minister to conservative Episcopalians in the United States. The
action took place in Singapore without the knowledge or approval of
the Episcopal Church's top officer. The consecrations come at a
time of heightened tensions within the Anglican communion,
especially over issues as whether to ordain gay men and lesbians as
priests. In the U.S., the Episcopal Church has become a target for
criticism from bishops in Africa and Asia, where Christianity has
been rapidly growing, but where it is competing for converts with
Islam. By Gustav Niebuhr.

nearly two years before Bill Clinton took office as president. But

 By LAURA INGRAHAM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Life is good at the front of the pack.
 &HT;    Here in Manchester, N.H., George W. Bush has his entourage and
his big-time endorsements. John McCain has his ``Straight Talk
Express'' bus, filled with the nation's top political reporters.
 &HT;    But for Alan Keyes, who finished a surprising third in Iowa,
life on the campaign trail is, well, not quite so glamorous.
 &HT;    As far as endorsements go, his big get this past weekend was
David Schippers. Schippers, in case you've forgotten, was one of
the faces of impeachment, the chief investigator for the House
Judiciary Committee. Obscure, yes _ but when you're running in the
back of the pack, you take what you can get.
 &HT;    After practically no one showed up at the Schippers press
conference, Keyes went to a place where he'd have a guaranteed
crowd: church. A devout Catholic, he mingled for an hour after Mass
here, to speak to a crowd of people who had gathered to catch a
glimpse of him.
 &HT;    Some were ardent supporters, others vocal critics _ wherever
Alan Keyes goes, he generates an intense emotional response.
 &HT;    This is the Harvard-educated Ph.D's second bid for the
presidency, following two losing U.S. Senate races in Maryland,
where he lives with his wife and three children. His governmental
experience is limited to two stints in the Reagan administration's
diplomatic service, at the United Nations and later the State
Department.
 &HT;    By all accounts Keyes' debate performances were impressive, but
campaigning as a single-digit man is tough work that requires long
stints away from home.
 &HT;    So what makes Alan run? His answer isn't modest.
 &HT;    ``The message that I carry is absolutely essential to the
survival of liberty in this country,'' he bellows, ``and no one
else in this race carries it effectively.''
 &HT;    The most interesting aspect of Keyes is also what will likely
prevent him from ever winning national office _ his passionate take
on controversial issues such as abortion, which he calls ``murder
in the womb.''
 &HT;    Keyes knows that in modern campaigns image is everything, and
that his image has problems.
 &HT;    ``People have mistaken intensity and passion for temper,'' says
Keyes, whom The New York Times recently dubbed ``The Angry
Conservative.'' ``But I'm not an angry person.''
 &HT;    Yet his blunt intensity is exactly what Keyes' supporters
respond to. Agree with him or not, Keyes' passion for the issues is
real. And, at a time when politics doesn't seem to be a profession
for true believers, spending a day with the fiery speaker is
refreshing, and a bit exhausting.
 &HT;    The more challenging a media question, the more Keyes seems to
relish it _ a far cry from the hyper-cautious George W. Bush. And
the phrase ``politically incorrect'' isn't in his campaign lexicon.
 &HT;    He doesn't seem the slightest bit uncomfortable about going from
morning Mass to an afternoon stop at Pete's Gun &AMP; Tackle, where he
holds forth before an enthusiastic throng of supporters on the
right to bear arms.
 &HT;    ``The Second Amendment wasn't put into the Constitution by our
founders as a kind of sports-and-entertainment amendment,'' he
crows to cheers and applause.
 &HT;    But not everyone is applauding Keyes' straight talk.
Conservatives privately grouse that, like Bauer and Forbes, Keyes
is ``selfish'' for staying in a race when his chances of winning
the nomination are zero. It's not his staying in the race that
bothers them, of course _ it's his attacks on other Republicans.
 &HT;    ``John McCain is indistinguishable in most respects from Gore
and Clinton,'' he says firmly, and you can almost hear the GOP
establishment wince.
 &HT;    Asked what will happen if Bush wins the nomination as expected,
Keyes' response is anything but heartening to the GOP faithful.
 &HT;    ``Republicans lose,'' he says flatly.
 &HT;    Bush ``is a good man,'' Keyes explains, but the Texas governor
simply doesn't have the intellectual firepower to fend off a
relentless Democratic attack this fall.
 &HT;    But Keyes is more reflective when talking about his own future.
He knows his chances are slim and his appeal limited. Ironically,
Keyes peaked when he acted most un-Keyesian _ when he accepted a
challenge and dove into a ``mosh pit'' in Iowa at the urging of
provocateur filmmaker Michael Moore.
 &HT;    ``In a sense my campaign is like being in a mosh pit,'' he says.
``When I reach the edge of the political mosh pit, I won't be able
to go any further.''
 &HT;    In the 1996 race, Keyes campaigned right up until the
convention, when he finally threw his support behind nominee Bob
Dole. This time around, however, after the way he's verbally
drubbed his rivals, it's hard to imagine a credible Keyes
endorsement of Bush or McCain.
 &HT;    But considering the fight the GOP will have on its hands in the
fall, the eventual nominee would do well to welcome Keyes and his
small-but-mighty band of supporters with open arms.
 &HT;    Heck, maybe Bush can take a speech and debate lesson from the
mosh-pit moralist.

 (Corrects reversed longitude/latitudes of Fort Kent and Bellingham,
Wash.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT KENT, Maine _ Route 1 starts here.
</P>
<P>
   From Fort Kent, Houlton is Hilton Head, Bangor is Miami Beach,
Portland is Barbados, and Boston is Buenos Aires. Fort Kent is in
the far north of legendary Aroostook, America's largest county east
of the Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   And why, incidentally, have so many millions been led to believe
that Route 1 starts in Presque Isle? No, no, no. Leave the pier at
Key West, point the car north, pass through all those speed traps,
Auto Miles, shopping malls, and Main Streets and when, about 2,000
winding miles of asphalt later, you get to Presque Isle, you've
still got 58 miles of serious driving before you arrive in Fort
Kent.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Kent, Maine (a Rand McNally-listed population of 2,123),
there is, in fact, a recently-installed stoplight, even if some
folks hereabouts quip that the only reason for its presence is so
that Quigley's Hardware can mention it in radio spots. There is a
McDonald's. But there is no Starbucks, no Gap, no Victoria's
Secret, and this is one of the few places left in America where
it's tough to find a USA Today. Even the nearest Wal-Mart is back
in Presque Isle. There is one movie theater, the Plourde Century,
but don't expect to be seeing ``Topsy-Turvy'' any time soon. (This
week, you'd better like ``The Green Mile.'') Hey, but first things
first. There are two nail and tanning salons.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a college, and in the realm of looking like a
backdrop for a Sonja Henie Film Festival, and with a latitude of
47.23 north and a longitude of 68.56 west, there is no more
isolated college, and, therefore, college athletic program in the
lower 48 states than the University of Maine-Fort Kent, and never
mind Western Washington University out there in Bellingham, which
has longitude-latitude readings of 122.43 and 48.73, respectively,
but which is in a town of 64,000 large enough to have a whole lot
more than one stoplight, not to mention its own daily newspaper.
North? Yup. Remote? Uh-uh.
</P>
<P>
   Athletically speaking, Fort Kent is the home office of remote.
So it is entirely fitting that in the midst of the ice and the snow
and the subzero temperatures, there is a nice little basketball
team, a ranked one, if you don't mind, a team whose Y2K fantasy is
a postseason bid to the NAIA Division 2 tournament (coming this
year to the unspeakable tackiness of Branson, Mo.), a team that has
brought together so many elements of our increasingly compact
global society that, as one local puts it, ``John Rocker wouldn't
like this team.''
</P>
<P>
   No, he wouldn't, not with the Bosnian Croat and the Bosnian
proper and the Lithuanian and the Canadian and the black kid from
London and the kid from Long Island and the dramatically
culture-shocked kid from Florida and the two kids who actually come
from Maine and, finally, the 5-foot-6-inch shooting guard who
cheerfully 'fesses up to having no point guard skills whatsoever
and who, it says here, lays open-and-shut claim to being the
greatest Laotian-born basketball player ever to draw a breath in
the history of this entire planet.
</P>
<P>
   Is that a diverse enough bunch for you? And have we mentioned
the coach, himself a black Londoner who admits that he usually
learns a lot more from these kids than they learn from him?
</P>
<P>
   His name is Derek Johnson, and after prepping for this gig by
spending his college career downstate at the University of
Maine-Machias, he is now addicted to this lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's isolated, all right,'' he says. ``But the feeling you get
here is such a good feeling that the isolation you feel is when you
leave here to go back where you came from. When I go back to
London, I can't wait to get back here, because, to me, London now
feels so crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   Such touching testimony to the virtues of Fort Kent, both town
and school, is a downright symphonic sound to the ears of Dr.
Charles Lyons, the ebullient school president who is so energetic,
gregarious, and unpretentious that he can only be thought of as the
anti-Silber. Lyons is proud of what's going on at his school, which
was continuously threatened with closure by the state legislature
during the early and mid '90s. A 27-year teaching and
administrative veteran of the University of Maine system _ he still
teaches one Introduction to Special Education course _ he was
brought into a dying school four years ago and given a simple
mandate: Increase the enrollment or we'll shutter the doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was Dick Radatz being asked to come in here and throw heat
for three innings,'' he says. ``And I had to want the ball every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   President Supercloser now points to some impressive numbers, the
most important of which is an enrollment that has soared 44 percent
in the past two years. With more than 1,000 students, 750 of which
are full-time enrollees, UMFK is now, as the president puts it,
``maxed out.'' Why, UMFK is no longer the smallest school in the
system, having passed Maine-Machias. The current priority is a
building campaign to ``grow the infrastructure to match the place
we have here.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;

</P>
<P>
   Being a cozy place with no secrets, it's not for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good if it's what you need,'' acknowledges Tim Farrar, a
guard from West Paris, Maine. ``But if someone whispers, it's a
shout across the campus.''
</P>
<P>
   There may not be Big Brother, but there is always Dr. Charlie,
who gives new meaning to the term ``hands-on boss.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't take any junk in the dorms,'' he explains. ``The best
way to kill enrollment is to have a lot of rowdyism in the dorms.
If we get it, someone's gonna be smelling momma's cooking
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Cut a class if you like, but expect to be confronted, with the
president himself. Charlie Lyons knows all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get around,'' he smiles. ``Here I can make the `visites de
parois,' the visits of the parish priest. You can't do that
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, the lapse into French. Across the river lies Clair, New
Brunswick, where the Maple Leaf Restaurant and Motel seductively
blinks garish lights to lure the kids across the border for the
under-21 drinking opportunities. Quebec is not far away. Spend any
time in Fort Kent and you will hear both French and Franglais. In
the local eating spots. At the hardware store. At the gas station.
Everywhere.

   ``My grandmother lays French on me all the time,'' says Julie
Marquis, a Fort Kent native who plays for the women's basketball
team. ``But I think it's finally dying out in the younger
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dommage. (Too bad.)
</P>
<P>
   Language issues aside, town and gown are seamless. The school
sells what the town sells, and that means family, safety, security,
and trust.
</P>

   ``We've got the Paradis Supermarket,'' points out Lyons. ``Every
night there will be 200 cars in the parking lot. They'll all be
running. No one worries. No one will think anything of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cars running in the parking lot is a suitable metaphor for the
college itself. No one comes to UMFK to face these harsh winters
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The professors care,'' confirms Shaun Tomblin, a rugged,
6-foot-3-inch senior from Rego Park, N.Y., who has given the
Bengals a solid inside presence and some serious locker room
leadership. ``If someone were to ask me what it's like here, I'd
say it's like sending your kid off to summer camp. It's isolated,
yes, but that means there are few distractions. You can concentrate
on the things that make you a better person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The teachers care,'' echoes Robert Miller, whose path from
Palm Beach to Fort Kent includes various run-ins with the law and a
sobering educational visit to a Florida state pen that told him,
whoa, there might be another way to go. ``They are committed to
you. I'm glad I found this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Miller says he's on track to graduate, and when he does,
he is taking that piece of parchment and waving it in certain
people's faces back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to prove to some critics, including people in my own
family, that I'm not a waste,'' he asserts. ``I want to go home
with that college degree and say, `I did it.' ''

&HT;     LOYAL AIRMAN TRIES TO REVIVE MEMORY OF WWII GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Samuel L. Maas, 85, a Southern California man,
tries as much as he can to keep alive the memory of Lt. Gen.
Millard F. Harmon, commander of America's Army Air Corps in the
Pacific during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon was 57 when his plane, a converted B-24, went down in
February 1945 as it flew from Guam to Hickam Field in Hawaii.
Harmon's name made headlines in every U.S. paper that year, but
since then he has slipped into obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Maas, a flight engineer aboard Harmon's plane from 1942 to 1945,
carries on a one-man crusade to mark each anniversary of Harmon's
disappearance. He said the general has never gotten his due from
Americans _ not from his native San Francisco, not from historians
of the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't know about him,'' said Maas, talking
from his home near Canoga Park. ``Some generals, including
(Douglas) MacArthur, went out of their way for publicity with the
way they walked, the way they talked. Gen. Harmon was just the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never said much, didn't want pictures taken of him. (He)
never received credit for his years in the South Pacific, for the
things that he did for this country,'' said Maas. ``I've kind of
made it my crusade to let people know what kind of service he gave
to us, to let people know what kind of man he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Maas, a tech sergeant, still talks haltingly about his furlough
in February 1945, about stopping for a midnight burger in Milwaukee
and hearing someone say Harmon's plane had gone down. He had served
on Harmon's crew, and he couldn't believe the general was gone.
He's not sure he believes it even now.
</P>
<P>
   The last message received from the crew of ``My Ever-Lovin' Dove
II'' was from Kwajalein Island, reporting ``plenty of fuel, good
weather and calm seas.'' Harmon's plane, designated a C-87, left
Kwajalein on Feb. 25, 1945, and was reported missing Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Ten men were killed when the plane went down, and if Maas hadn't
left for the States in mid-February he would have been one of them.
The fact that he didn't go down with the others _ the importance
chance played in his life _ has gnawed at him all these years.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon ``was a quiet man, a gentle man, and he treated everyone
equally,'' said Maas, a retired baker. ``When the War Department
believed he and the crew could not be found, Gen. Curtis LeMay took
over the command, and it became a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of Harmon's plane has never been fully
explained, but Maas' theory is that a faulty gas-operated heater
caused the plane to fill with fumes and explode without leaving a
trace. A search lasting 18 days _ the longest Pacific search of the
war _ found no debris.
</P>
<P>
   Before he left on furlough, Mass said, he had seen a crewman
working on the heater. ``If the line to the heater had not been
properly connected, there could have been 100-octane fumes coming
out of the line or the heater itself,'' he said. ``I'm 90 percent
sure that's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   It had happened on at least one other plane when it was in the
air, said Maas, but a crewman had put out the fire in time. ``If
someone had lit a cigarette, or if there was just a spark of some
kind the fumes could (have caused) a major, instant explosion,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking back 55 years to the heater repair, Maas said, ``I'm
the only one who saw this happen. I wish I had told the pilot. I
wish I had told somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 26, 1945, a task force departed from Hawaii, searching
the area around the Marshall Islands until March 18. One squadron
logged 2,167 search hours. The search force also included the
aircraft carriers Corregidor and Saratoga, the battleship
Pennsylvania and the cruiser Chester. Among the nearly 200 planes
involved in the search, one B-24 crashed, and its crew was lost.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to commanding the air war against Japan, Harmon was
called on to investigate the mistakes of the Battle of Peleliu,
where seven of 10 Marines in the attacking force were either killed
or wounded. Maas remembered walking around Peleliu with Harmon,
staring down into caves that still harbored Japanese troops. He
also remembered flying Harmon into Guadalcanal when half the island
was still held by the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a brave man. Honestly brave,'' said Maas.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon, son of a military family, was born on the Presidio Army
base in San Francisco. He graduated from West Point in 1912, served
in the Philippines and joined Gen. John Pershing's expedition into
Mexico before going to France and receiving a Croix de Guerre as a
pilot in World War I. He was named chief of staff of the Army Air
Corps in 1942. Shortly afterward he became air corps commander in
the Pacific. In June 1944 he escaped death when his ship was
torpedoed off New Georgia, Solomon Islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great man,'' Maas said, ``and he should have lived
many more years.''

`OUTLAW': A TOY PISTOL AND CHARM WILL GO ONLY SO FAR
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Horst Fantazzini was a real-life Italian bandit who, if the
version of his exploits presented in ``Outlaw!'' (which is based on
Fantazzini's autobiography) can be trusted, robbed a series of
banks armed only with a toy pistol and his boyish charm.
</P>
<P>
   Fantazzini was something of a legendary figure in Italy in the
1960s, and Enzo Monteleone's opening montage, with its speeded-up
spaghetti-western style score, efficiently inscribes Fantazzini in
the pop folklore of the decade. Re-enactments of his various
holdups and escapes from prison alternate with black-and-white
newspaper images of the Beatles and demonstrators and police
fighting in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   In these early sequences, Fantazzini's own persona combines the
radical cheek of the era's celebrities with the theatrical flair of
its political radicals, and the movie itself seems ready to proceed
in a similarly breezy, daring style.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as the opening credits are done, the mood shifts.
The main action of ``Outlaw!'' unfolds during a single day in July
1973 when a grim, desperate Fantazzini, using a very real gun,
tries to break out of a Piedmont prison, wounding three guards and
taking two more hostage. The basic narrative structure of the film,
which tracks the tense, tedious negotiations between a
hostage-taker and the forces of law and order, may remind you of
``Dog Day Afternoon'' or of a half-dozen episodes of ``Hill Street
Blues.'' It's not giving much away to note that these stories
usually end badly.
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``Outlaw!'' particularly effective is that it quietly
focuses on the human dimensions of its story, refusing the
temptations of sensationalism and melodrama. There is not much
violence in the movie, but what there is _ in particular
Fantazzini's possibly inadvertent shooting of the guards _ is taken
seriously, by the characters and the filmmakers alike. And the
relationships that develop in the course of a long, nerve-racking
day _ especially between Fantazzini and his hostages (Giovanni
Esposito and Emilio Solfrizzi), but also among the assorted
bureaucrats who must try to defuse the crisis _ take on surprising
emotional complexity.
</P>
<P>
   Fantazzini, who likes to boast of his anarchist parentage and to
quote Bertolt Brecht, advises his charges, both of whom are
migrants from southern Italy, to strike for better working
conditions. Outside the prison the prosecutor and the police chief
argue over jurisdiction and procedure, while the prison manager
(Antonio Petrocelli), whose personality is an unstable alloy of
vanity and sensitivity, vacillates between selfish worry that his
reputation for running a humane, modern institution will be ruined
and honest terror that lives will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outlaw!'' is being advertised as a comedy, and it does have
some funny moments. But these all arise from the terrible
absurdities of its central situation. The overall mood is less
madcap than melancholy, and what resonates as the movie ends, in
spite of the jaunty music over the final credits, is the sense that
we have seen something approaching tragedy: the confrontation
between an angry, passionate, powerless individual and the
well-meaning, rational, but ultimately murderous cruelty of the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Monteleone and his cinematographer, Arnoldo Catinari, have
saturated ``Outlaw!'' with an unusual sort of period flavor. This
is not because they're ostentatiously precise in their attention to
clothes and haircuts. (It's doubtful, in any case, that fashions in
inmate mufti or corrections officers' uniforms change much from
year to year), but because the film itself feels like a throwback
to an earlier, more politically volatile era.
</P>
<P>
   With its scrappy cinema verite style, its sparing, precise use
of formal tricks and its understated but unmistakable ideological
program, ``Outlaw!'' could almost be a lost specimen of post-1960s
political filmmaking, made by dutiful, slightly timid children of
Godard and Lina Wertmuller. But ``Outlaw!'' is less a political
film than an expression of nostalgia, not for the 1970s as such,
but for an approach to filmmaking that flourished in Europe in
those years and that seems in retrospect as heroic _ and as doomed
_ as Horst Fantazzini himself.
</P>

PORK AND SEAFOOD: OPPOSITES ATTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: recipe at end of article) 
 (bl)  
 By JOHN WILLOUGHBY and CHRIS SCHLESINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the American concept of surf and turf is hopelessly
old-fashioned, it retains an odd appeal. Having seafood and meat on
the same plate lets you alternate bites and flavors from two
realms.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another form of mixing sea and land, one that is
found in cuisines all over the world and one that actually works
much better: seafood with pork. This combination is far more
satisfying, because the two disparate items are cooked together
rather than merely laid on the same plate like the old steak and
lobster.
</P>
<P>
   We first became aware of this combination in the traditional
Portuguese dish called porco a alentejana, clams sharing a stew pot
with cubes of marinated pork. The rich, deep flavor of the meat
provides the ideal counterpart to the shellfish's brininess.
</P>
<P>
   After discovering this dish, we began to pay more attention to
the pork-seafood combination, and examples began to pop up all
over. There are few self-respecting chowders, for instance, that do
not include either bacon or salt pork as flavoring, and most
everyone who has ever attended a cocktail party is familiar with
hors d'oeuvres of scallops wrapped in bacon. The Italians wrap
shrimp in prosciutto and serve mussels in a broth with sausage,
while the Spanish combine shrimp and sausage in paella, and cod and
chorizo in a stew.
</P>
<P>
   But it was when we began traveling in Asia that we came across
the most inventive seafood-pork combinations. The Vietnamese dish
known as banh xeo, or ``happy pancake,'' for example, includes
shrimp and pork folded up inside a rice-flour crepe along with
vegetables and spices, while squid stuffed with pork and galangal
is wildly popular in Thailand. And the most common street food we
encountered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, was yong tow foo, tofu cakes
stuffed with both minced fish and pork, usually enlivened with
chilies.
</P>
<P>
   Among the wide range of classic Chinese dishes in which pork and
seafood share equal billing, the best known include lobster
Cantonese, in which the shellfish is stir-fried with ground pork
and black beans, and red-cooked fish, a whole fish deep-fried and
then combined with slivers of stir-fried pork loin. As we
discovered more and more examples, we began to understand the
unique flavor dynamic. The faintly gamy taste of lamb is a bit too
distinctive to marry well with fish, and beef is just too beefy.
But pork, with its mild but rich taste, perfectly complements the
clean, delicate flavor of seafood.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has experienced the byplay of flavors between the
austerity of cod and the richness of pork sausage, tasted mussels
in a broth enlivened by spicy pork, or eaten a pork chop enriched
with the sea taste of clams will understand why this combination
has achieved its enduring popularity.

FOLLOWING THE FILMS, NOT THE CASH, AT SUNDANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each year at the Sundance Film Festival, you sigh and prepare
yourself for the snap assessment: it's ``the year of the ... ,''
which generally refers to the impact that a few of the pictures
make. (Almost no one sees enough of the roster to grasp the year's
programming trend. I scrambled to see 16 films in three days last
week, most of them dramatic.)
</P>
<P>
   Such an attempt to fit the festival into a neat catch phrase is
meaningless. This time, a unanimity of opinion prevailed, although
it was not an aesthetic one. Even those who couldn't tear
themselves from the party circuit long enough to catch a movie
understood that this was the Year Without Harvey. Weinstein, of
Miramax, of course, whose big-ticket purchases of indie films have
made him a festival legend. (He was recovering from an illness.)
</P>
<P>
   Without Weinstein, a force of nature, blocking out the sun,
looming over the proceedings with a satchelful of cash to shove at
some lucky director, attendees were left to create their own
programming instead of chasing the Miramax selections. One was even
heard to say that this year's gathering at Park City, Utah, was
like those in the halcyon days before 1989's breakthrough ``sex,
lies and videotape,'' when the festival was known as the U.S. Film
Festival. Except there were a lot more movies.
</P>
<P>
   Among the few documentaries I was able to see was Marc Singer's
powerful ``Dark Days,'' set in an underground community of the
homeless living beneath Manhattan in one of Amtrak's tunnels.
Singer, a first-time filmmaker _ he learned to work his camera just
before descending into the underground to live with and film his
subjects, who also served as his crew _ has a close-cropped head
that gave him the effortless chic of a British pop star. He could
have been the The's Matt Johnson glaring out from the cover of a
12-inch remix.
</P>
<P>
   His documentary, which uses the canny pulse of D.J. Shadow's
music, was filmed in black and white, which deepens the bleakness.
Singer's gift for photography is undeniable; he could make a living
as a shooter and shared a cinematography award. His directing
instincts are also immaculate. ``Dark Days'' doesn't lapse into
cheap sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   His subjects are rueful, funny and gifted storytellers. By
surviving in the roughest of circumstances, they have become
toughened raconteurs uninterested in pitying themselves. The movie
is as tough as its milieu. As good as ``Dark Days'' was _ it
received Freedom of Expression and Audience Awards _ I began to
fear it would shut out from recognition ``Long Night's Journey into
Day,'' Frances Reid and Deborah Johnson's documentary on South
Africa's efforts to make itself whole after eliminating the
institutionalized hatred of apartheid. The Jury Grand Prize did go
to the more than deserving ``Journey.''
</P>
<P>
   This film on the repercussions of a potentially dehumanizing
horror and its painful aftermath is astonishing. Simple and
succinct, the documentary centers on the Truth and Reconciliation
Committee, which investigated atrocities, as that body examines the
nation's sanctioned violence. (The film will play at the Film Forum
in New York City starting on March 29.)
</P>
<P>
   The crowds also went for the playful documentary ``The Eyes of
Tammy Faye,'' whose title makes it sound like a sexploitation epic
from Cinemax's late-night lineup. The movie details the life and
times of Tammy Faye Bakker, ex-wife of the discredited
televangelist Jim Bakker.
</P>
<P>
   The picture was fun and managed to create some sympathy for its
subject, though it is a little too campy for its own good; any
movie with narration by RuPaul doesn't need sock puppets
introducing each segment (a nod to ``Babe''). The directors, Fenton
Bailey and Randy Barbato, chose to emphasize how Bakker's cosmetic
surgery has given her an alarming resemblance to the wide-eyed
dolls and marionettes slumped in chairs all over her house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girlfight,'' a first feature written and directed by Karyn
Kusama, roused audiences, too. Its star, Michelle Rodriguez, a
brooding, deft young actress, also made her debut and, with her
movie-star charisma, tapered deltoids and skin the color of a Los
Angeles sunrise, broke hearts on both sides of the sexual equator.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez plays a high school senior whose frustration with her
life and physical restlessness _ she lives to fight _ brings her to
a boxing gym, where she begins to train for bouts. Rodriguez's
stance and snapping hook made her look like a natural.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girlfight'' builds toward a ``Rocky''-like uplift. It could
have been called ``Flashpunch (What a Beating!).'' To her credit,
though, Kusama is out to create a girl-power mythology, and she
shows an affinity for actors that is not easily dismissed. (She won
the best directing prize from the jury.)
</P>
<P>
   In a question-and-answer session after one of the screenings,
Kusama revealed that she directed Rodriguez as if she were a young
Marlon Brando, a savvy piece of instruction; not many young
actresses are led to take the camera on instead of flirting with
it.
</P>
<P>
   But the camera took to Rodriguez as quickly and helplessly as
audiences did. Her triumphant splash may have been the only other
element of the festival whose buzz created agreement. Especially
since there wasn't exactly agreement about the Grand Jury Prize.
``Girlfight'' shared it with ``You Can Count on Me,'' a curveball
of a comic melodrama written and directed by a playwright turned
screenwriter, Kenneth Lonergan.
</P>
<P>
   Some shrugged off his film as ``a TV movie,'' and even more
specifically ``a Lifetime movie,'' and wondered about its chances
of getting picked for distribution. (The Shooting Gallery, its
production company, intends to bring the film out without a
partner.)
</P>
<P>
   But ``You Can Count on Me'' has a teasing lilt and focuses its
even-tempered concentration on its heroine (Laura Linney), whose
determination to be responsible still leaves her ensnarled by her
wrecked impulses. One of the finest performances I saw was given by
Mark Ruffalo, as Linney's amiable and petulant slug of a younger
brother, whose ambition extended only to getting out of their small
hometown. When he has to come back home, it drives him _ and
eventually her _ crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Linney comes through with a beauty of a performance, too: in the
film, her eyes pop open when instincts take over in a way that
shows she had a wild streak as a younger woman. She is constantly
wrestling with her brother and her son (Rory Culkin, whose wobbly
deadpan is the equal of his older brother, Macauley).
</P>
<P>
   The picture has the quiet honesty of ``Alice Doesn't Live Here
Anymore,'' and the sad thing is, people might disregard ``Alice''
and its minor-key accomplishment if it were to play at Sundance
these days.
</P>
<P>
   One who wouldn't give ``Count'' short shrift was Martin
Scorsese, the director of ``Alice,'' who was executive producer of
``Count'' and whose company was its co-producer. In his question
session after a screening, Lonergan said that Scorsese had left him
alone. He was smart enough to see that Lonergan's original
material, which garnered him the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award,
found the absurdity in the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   A hot ticket not in competition was the Korean action film
``Nowhere to Hide,'' written and directed by Lee Myung-Se. A
lunatic derby of cuts and bravura moviemaking fired from the barrel
of a gun, ``Hide'' is all verve and vibes, a rollicking blend of
exhibitionistic vitality and hommage, so much so that one of the
protagonists is a detective named Woo, after the Hong Kong action
director John Woo.
</P>
<P>
   Narrative skills are lacking, though. ``Hide'' could be a tone
poem with several lines missing. Lee's reflexes are so sure that
his skills left the audience giddy and shaken from the kind of high
you can only get in a dark room with several hundred strangers who
feel exactly as you do. Those strangers, Jonathan Demme included,
queued around Lee and his translator after the screening on the
cold nighttime streets of Park City. They just couldn't walk away.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Remembering J. Frank Wilson
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Gov. Bush sent a proclamation. Our Texas state
representative spoke. One of the old band members drove all the way
from San Angelo, halfway across Texas and then some, to attend the
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   And there at Lufkin High School after everything had been said
that needed to be said about J. Frank Wilson, and with scores of
students crowded around and even singing along, his million-seller
gold record of 1964, ``Last Kiss,'' rocked over the sound system:
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh where oh where can my baby be,
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord took her away from me.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's gone to heaven so I got to be good,
</P>
<P>
   ``So I can see my baby when I leave this world.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was that J. Frank Wilson was inducted into the Lufkin High
School Hall of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   He died in 1991, a couple of months short of his 50th birthday.
I knew him then, and I knew him when.
</P>
<P>
   He had graduated LHS in 1960, a year behind me. He would
out-distance us all in a very short time.
</P>
<P>
   J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers took ``Last Kiss'' to the top
of the charts, and J. Frank almost died doing it _ not exactly like
the song said, but close enough:
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't stop so I swerved to the right,
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget the sound that night,
</P>
<P>
   ``The screaming tires, the busting glass,
</P>
<P>
   ``The painful scream that I heard last.''
</P>
<P>
   In the song it's the teenage girlfriend who dies, but ``Last
Kiss'' was no less tragic than the real life story of J. Frank,
wrecked by fame. It just took him a lot longer to die.
</P>
<P>
   Early on the morning of Oct. 23, 1964, driving all night for
another performance on the rock-'n'-roll circuit, a station wagon
the band was traveling in crashed head-on with a tractor-trailer
when their driver fell asleep at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The driver died instantly. J. Frank was severely injured with
head lacerations, broken ribs and a broken ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week he was back on stage, performing on crutches and
in a cast. Some say it was an example of his professionalism.
Others blamed the greed of the people making money off of his
success.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever got rich, it wasn't J. Frank. He eventually had to sue
the record company to collect any royalties. After the lawyers and
expenses were paid, he ended up with about $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   J. Frank had other records, but none that ever hit. Finally, he
came back to Lufkin to work in a nursing home and at other jobs. In
his last years, he'd become a nursing home patient himself, never
having fully recovered from the injuries he received in the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Jam re-released ``Last Kiss'' in the past year. They
didn't make any money off of it, either, but by design. All
proceeds went to aid Kosovo war victims.
</P>
<P>
   J. Frank's mother, Mrs. Marjorie Mayer, 75, on hand at Lufkin
High for the ceremonies, told the local newspaper how proud her son
would have been that Pearl Jam recorded his song and, more so, that
it had served a worthy cause.
</P>
<P>
   It was nice, too, what his former band member, Lewis Elliott of
San Angelo, said of the ceremony:
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd love it. He loved this kind of thing. Frank was the one
that liked to do all the talking, and all the singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the star.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, more than a foot of snow blanketed portions of
the northern Cascades as a moist flow of air from the Pacific
spread over the Northwestern States. The risk for heavy snow will
continue Wednesday across the higher elevations of the Northwest as
a corridor of moist air streams into the region ahead of an
approaching cold front. The heaviest snow will probably fall over
the southern Cascades at altitudes above 3,000 feet. Meanwhile,
showers will occur in the lower elevations from far northern
California to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Subsiding currents of air associated with high pressure will
promote dry weather over much of the Southern states Wednesday.
Amid ample sunshine, afternoon readings will reach well into the
50s across the Front Range and west-central Plains. An exception to
the fair weather will be near the Rio Grande Valley, where a
slow-moving jet stream disturbance causes showers and isolated
thunderstorms in southern Texas and near the Louisiana coast. More
than a half inch of rain is possible in a few locations.
</P>
<P>
   Gusty winds from the northwest will continue to deliver
unseasonably cold air into the Northeast on Wednesday. As the cold
air gathers moisture in transit across the unfrozen waters of Lake
Ontario, scattered snow showers will form across portions of
upstate New York. Flurries are also likely in interior New England
as air is moistened upon ascending the higher terrain. Meanwhile,
air drying on descent from the Appalachians will promote ample
sunshine along the Middle Atlantic and Northeast coasts.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Two-Faced Month &QL;
</P>
<P>
   January temperatures averaged near normal in the Northeast, but
the climate record is misleading. The first two weeks of the month
were more than 10 degrees above the long-term average, but then
persistent arctic chill erased the warm anomaly. A strong, straight
jet stream flooded the nation with mild Pacific air early in the
month. Thereafter, the jet stream became contorted, drawing cold
air from Canadian tundra into the East. The two faces of January
2000 were an example of a natural but irregular rhythm that causes
the jet stream to shift between straight and serpentine throughout
the year.

INDONESIAN GENERAL DENIES HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Indonesia's most prominent general denied
on Tuesday that he was responsible for human rights abuses in East
Timor and sidestepped a suggestion by President Abdurrahman Wahid
that he resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a soldier, I am going to continue to fight to reveal the
truth,'' the general, Wiranto, declared, relaxed and smiling at a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had not yet read a report by an Indonesian human
rights commission, issued on Monday, that placed him at the top of
a list of 33 officers and civilians responsible for a wave of
violence and destruction in East Timor last year. The former
Portuguese colony voted for independence in August after nearly a
quarter-century of occupation by Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I know about the report I learned through the television
and the newspapers,'' he said. ``There are a few things that I do
not like and do not agree with.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had done his best to try to curb a wave of terror
carried out by military-backed militias after East Timor's vote on
Aug. 30 to break away from Indonesia. He said the commission ``does
not care about this positive activity at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The release of the report and the likelihood of prosecutions by
the attorney general raised fears of a backlash by the disgruntled
military. Both the stock market and the Indonesian currency, the
rupiah, faltered slightly on Tuesday in reaction to the news,
although most political analysts here doubt that the military will
move against the government.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding typically confident, Wahid, who is on a trip abroad,
brushed aside the speculation on Monday and said Wiranto should
resign from his cabinet post as coordinating minister for political
and military affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The general, who was chief of the armed forces during the
violence in East Timor, responded on Tuesday by saying he would
wait to talk with the president when he returns to Jakarta in two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his record in East Timor, the general said that he had
sent extra troops to maintain security, had arranged for rival
groups to sign peace treaties and had declared martial law when the
situation worsened.
</P>
<P>
   His critics have said much of this activity did not amount to a
sincere effort to halt the abuses of local militias, which were
created, armed and guided by the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto, who like many Indonesians uses one name, has retained
prominent human rights lawyers to defend him. His chief lawyer,
Adnan Buyung Nasution, attacked the report on Tuesday, saying:
``There is no evidence, no witnesses and no documents to show that
Wiranto has done anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The report and the general's legalistic defense are themselves
encouraging signs that Indonesia is taking steps toward normalizing
the role of the politically powerful military, several analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, the speaker of Indonesia's parliament, Amien Rais,
said: ``You couldn't imagine two years ago Mr. Wiranto being sacked
by a civilian leader. Now, I think Mr. Wiranto and his colleagues
understand very, very well that democracy always demands that the
military is subordinated under the civilian.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a meeting of international aid donors in Jakarta on Tuesday,
Jean-Michel Severino, the World Bank's vice president for Asia,
said: ``There is a new sense of optimism that Indonesia can indeed
resume the path of real development led by a democratic and
transparent government and based on a competitive and just
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added a warning: ``The events of the past year have also
taught us how fragile these political and economic gains can be.''

`EQUAL LOVE': WHEN CHILDREN BECOME PARENTS OF THEIR PARENTS
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Ho Davies, son of a Welsh father and Chinese mother, born
in England and living in Michigan, writes of border living and
border crossings. Indeed, half the stories in this collection use
settings and voices that are British; in the other half they are
American, though in two of these the central characters are of
Chinese and Indian descent respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Davies' thematic borders go deeper than place and nationality.
They run between parents and children. Most of the stories deal
with the shifting holds each has upon the other. Not only does the
genetic clasp exert itself past birth and through a whole life, but
it seems to run backward as well as forward. The sons are fathers
to their fathers; the daughters, mothers to their mothers. Their
stories stretch the book's epigraph: E.M. Forster asserting that a
physical tie binds parents to children but not children to parents.
If it did, Forster wrote, it would be a condition of ``equal love''
and ``life would lose much of its pathos and much of its squalor,
and we would be wonderfully happy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Equal Love,'' the title of the collection, qualifies Forster
without quite contradicting him. Separate but equal might be closer
to describing these parents and children stretched out upon each
others' racks. Pathos is nowhere lost, and happiness, far from
wonderful, is at most an occasional draw of breath between spasms.
</P>
<P>
   At times the balance of love inclines to the parent. In ``Brave
Girl,'' a dentist's little daughter goes to work with him every day
until her mother, who has left with another man, can send for her.
Through Davies' skillful narration, what we first see is the
child's self-dramatizing resolve to help her abandoned father. She
stays with him while he treats his child patients, imagining that
her presence will calm them down for him.
</P>
<P>
   Later, to show her confidence she asks him to pull two loose
baby teeth and finds that it hurts well beyond his soothing
promise. This is no disillusion but relief, as if from a burden of
caring that is too weighty for her age. It is the
soon-to-be-deprived father, we sense, whose love for his child will
remain sorrowful and abiding.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Everything You Can Remember in 30 Seconds Is Yours to
Keep,'' a young woman breaks with her druggie husband when the
social services remove their baby. She summons her mother,
respectable but beginning to fail from Alzheimer's disease, to help
her set up an orderly household. The social worker praises the
result but finds the grandmother too shaky to be with an infant,
whereupon the daughter returns the old woman to her assisted-living
quarters, confident she can now qualify on her own for her child's
custody.
</P>
<P>
   Mother love trumps filial love, and, in one of the book's most
touching passages, the theme is inverted and finely reprised. As
the daughter drives off she visualizes her mother ``at her window,
dazzled by the light, turning around, her arm gone sore from
waving, her eyes adjusting to the dimness of the room.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Cakes and Baby,'' it is a grown daughter who realizes her
bond to her spendthrift mother, though initially raging at it. Her
Indian husband cajoles and reassures her with his attentions, part
uxorious, part giggly. (``Love is not a pie,'' he says as she
sourly takes dessert to the mother's Thanksgiving lunch, and ``Love
is a sandwich,'' as she reluctantly accepts foil-wrapped leftovers
afterward.) And with a quizzical security in his own traditions.
(``You know me, genetically predisposed toward filial
obligation.'').
</P>
<P>
   In ``Today Is Sunday'' the balances intertwine. A grown son
visits his failing father only to find that he is about to drive 30
miles, despite aches, pains and bad weather, to visit his own
mother, who is all but comatose in a geriatric hospital. The son
remonstrates _ surely one Sunday can be skipped _ but when the
father insists, agrees to drive him. The father is a son, a son can
be a father, and when the old woman briefly becomes conscious she
mistakes the young man for the old. The story is gaunt and abrupt;
the point is made perhaps too schematically, but it is made,
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Davies writes with impressive skill; sometimes, despite the
seriousness of the theme, with more skill than conveyed feeling.
His finely wrought urns are not always full. Several stories,
particularly two treating adultery or near-adultery, sag back to
The New Yorker circa 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes sheer exuberance of style and wit buoy up an otherwise
inconsequential piece. The comedy of Anglo-American differences has
been done, overdone and done to death. Davies gives it a spark of
life with the story of an Englishman who studies in the United
States and wins scholarships, a professorship, an American wife.
Bit by bit the Britishisms that earn him favor are ironed out. His
career declines, he sleeps with his students, his wife leaves him
and eventually he returns home.
</P>
<P>
   True, the story is not much. What lifts it is the form. Davies
writes it as a series of instructions for British expatriates.
Some, at least, are delightful: ``When you feel homesick eat at
McDonald's or Burger King or Kentucky Fried Chicken, just like at
home.'' Welcome to the global strip mall.
</P>
<P>
   Davies can be at his best, in fact, when taking the most
chances. A couple of stories _ ``Sales,'' ``Frogmen'' _ venture so
far that they get lost, or I do. On the other hand there is the
wildly wonderful ``The Next Life,'' about a young Chinese-American
hiring professional mourners for his father's wake and winning back
their fee in an all-night poker game.
</P>
<P>
   The most moving and suggestive piece in the collection is also
on the wild side. A middle-class black man, happily married to a
white woman and living peacefully in a New England community, has
his happiness abducted by a visitation from aliens. Whether it is
real or hallucinated is not clear, nor is it particularly important
except that it leaves the reader a little off balance, a little
exposed. What we are exposed to is universal: the vulnerability to
outside blows of even the most loving human bonds. Marriage is
mixed in this case but not only in this one. They are all mixed.

 &HT;    MEDICATION ERRORS KILL THOUSANDS EACH YEAR, FDA SAYS
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An estimated 7,000 people die each year as a result
of medication errors, members of Congress were told Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``No drug is 100 percent safe. No pharmacologically active
medicine exists that does not have side effects,'' Dr. Janet
Woodcock, a Food and Drug Administration official, told the Senate
Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Although most drug reactions are not fatal, the United States
spends more than $75 billion a year on adverse drug reactions, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, nearly 2.7 billion prescriptions were filled in the
United States. Roughly half of all Americans take prescription
drugs each year, spending $100 billion. The FDA does not know what
percentage of those are prescribed or taken incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the General Accounting Office found that between 25
and 50 percent of all adverse drug incidents among hospital
patients resulted from medication errors. Medication errors are
defined by the FDA as ``mistakes in the medication prescribing and
dispensing process.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodcock urged lawmakers to increase the FDA budget to create
better systems of reporting and examining medication errors and
drug reactions.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's annual budget for clinical research into drug
reactions is about $1 million a year, but some experts believe at
least $50 million is need to enhance drug safety programs.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacists, doctors and patients all contribute to medication
errors.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacists make mistakes in reading prescriptions, calculating
dosages or dispensing the wrong drug because of similarities in
their names. Doctors sometimes prescribe the wrong drug, write
illegibly or order the wrong dosage. Patients frequently fail to
follow instructions or fail to inform their doctors of potentially
conflicting medications.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is implementing several approaches to reduce medication
errors, including encouraging physicians to write their
prescriptions on computers. The agency also suggests renaming and
repackaging drugs with similar names and packages. It also suggests
that pharmacists play a greater role in advising doctors what drugs
to prescribe.
</P>
<P>
   The number of adverse drug reactions has increased because of a
rising elderly population that is more susceptible to negative drug
effects, said Dr. Richard Platt, a professor of ambulatory care and
prevention at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of health care became a prominent issue last fall
after the Institute of Medicine released a study that showed nearly
100,000 Americans die each year from medical errors.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine report released last fall recommended
mandatory reporting to state agencies. However, the panel of
medical experts said state agencies lack the expertise to examine
the reports appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   Woodcock said she expects President Clinton's 2001 budget, to be
released Monday, to address the issue of medical errors.

 &HT;    HOSPITALS SAY THEY'RE FACING A MEDICARE COST CRUNCH
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly 60 percent of the nation's hospitals will
not be able to cover the cost of treating Medicare patients by
2004, threatening the future of some hospitals, according to a
report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many hospitals in crisis across America,'' said Dick
Davidson, president of the American Hospital Association, which
concluded its four-day annual meeting here Tuesday. ``That crisis
means a crisis for the patients and communities that depend upon
our services.''
</P>
<P>
   The AHA, which represents 5,000 hospitals and related health
care networks nationwide, has complained since 1987 that the
Medicare cuts imposed in that year's balanced budget act were too
deep.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Congress restored about $17 billion of the Medicare
cuts _ roughly half going to hospitals _ but Davidson said that
``can only be viewed as a first step. More relief is needed to help
hospitals keep pace with the cost of caring for patients.''
</P>
<P>
   A study prepared for the AHA by the Lewin(CQ) Group said the
1987 law would have slashed Medicare payments to hospitals by $119
billion between 1998 and 2004. Last year's bill restored $8.4
billion during that period, leaving hospitals nearly $111 billion
below where they would have been before the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Heeding the hospitals' complaint, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,
R-Texas, introduced a bill Tuesday to restore $14.6 billion to
Medicare hospital reimbursements over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made headway last year in correcting some excessive
Medicare cuts,'' Hutchison said. ``This bill would finish the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the White House health policy adviser, said it
is often difficult to pinpoint the causes of reductions in Medicare
hospital payments, which also could result from reduced use of
hospitals and increased use of outpatient services and and
medication. But Jennings said President Clinton is willing to
review evidence that the balanced budget changes have specifically
hurt hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings declined to comment on any Medicare proposals Clinton
might make in his 2001 budget next Monday, but suggested that
hospitals are likely to benefit from administration efforts to
expand health insurance coverage of the uninsured and strengthen
Medicare's long-range financial picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the (federal budget) surpluses have been achieved
through our success in restraining growth, and there is agreement
that it should be reinvested in health care,'' Jennings said.
``Infusing more money into health care should benefit actual people
as well as hospitals.''

&HT;     EXECUTIVE MOURNS LOSS OF AIRLINE'S `FAMILIES'

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To John Kelly, it was like losing family.
</P>
<P>
   The top executive of Alaska Airlines said that in addition to 53
paying passengers, there were 12 of his own employees and 23 of
their loved ones riding free on Flight 261, which crashed off into
the Pacific Ocean on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's numbing,'' Kelly, 54, the chairman and chief executive of
Alaska Airlines, told a news conference. ``I've never been through
anything like this in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The MD-83, carrying 88 people, was en route from Puerto
Vallarta, Mexico, to Seattle when it went down. It marked the
biggest accident suffered by the company in nearly 30 years and was
the airline's first fatal accident in 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-growing airline has promoted itself as among the safest
air carriers in the United States. Its reach stretches along the
West Coast, from resorts in Mexico to rugged corners of Alaska and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until today it was probably the best domestic record in the
industry,'' said Jon Proctor, editor of Airliners magazine.
``Twenty-four years since a fatal accident. That's a long time in
today's business.''
</P>
<P>
   In the generation since Alaska Airlines' last disaster, the
company has grown from a little-known puddle-jumper to a major
regional carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines, based in Seattle, has 500 daily departures from
40 cities in the western United States and Mexico. Of its
89-aircraft fleet, 38 are MD-80s, a series that includes the MD-83
that crashed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The airline traces its beginnings to a three-passenger float
plane that began service between Anchorage and Bristol Bay, Alaska,
in 1932, under the name McGee Airways. The present name was adopted
in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly frequently remarked about his own disbelief at the news of
the plane crash. He used the word family, referring to his
employees and their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so personal,'' Kelly said. ``There's shock and
disbelief. I've never been through this before.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the five crew members, the passengers included
three Alaska Airlines employees; four people who worked for its
sister carrier Horizon Air and 23 nonpaying travelers, all believed
to be family members or close friends of company employees.
</P>
<P>
   Although Alaska and Horizon airlines now total more than 12,000
employees, the company prides itself on having a corporate culture
of a smaller operation.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said that many employees noted that Monday's flight was
booked nowhere near its capacity of 140 and took advantage of that
to book free rides back from the popular tourist destination on
Mexico's West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are our families, these are our employees, these are our
co-workers, these are our friends, these are our loved ones,''
Kelly said, shaking his head.

LAWMAKERS TORN OVER CUBAN BOY'S FATE  
 DON'T CALL IT PORK  
 FIRST LADY PEEVES CONGRESSMAN  
 CONSERVATIVES CHALLENGE FCC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: The South)  (mk) 
 By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The question of what to do about Elian Gonzalez is
proving as vexing to Congress as it is to the public at large.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers may soon be asked to confer emergency citizenship on
the rescued Cuban boy in order to remove his case from the
jurisdiction of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. They
are split on whether he should be allowed to remain with relatives
in Miami or returned to the custody of his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both U.S. and international law recognize the unique
relationship between parent and child, and family reunification has
long been a cornerstone of both American immigration law and INS
practice,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Jim Demint, R-S.C., said that Cuba's Communist rule was
reason enough not to return Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the little boy should grow up in a free country to
honor his mother's hopes and dreams,'' DeMint said. Elian's mother
drowned in the risky voyage to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The division is not just along partisan lines. Some Republicans
have voiced qualms about stepping between the 6-year-old boy and
his surviving parent given their party's focus on family values,
and some Democrats favor citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., proposed that the youngster be
returned provided the Cuban government agrees that he can receive
U.S. citizenship at age 18 if he chooses.
</P>
<P>
   The level of GOP resistance caught the party leadership off
guard and led Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to put
off any legislative action until the week ahead at the earliest.
House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, is reportedly anxious
about a floor vote and the political repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt many lawmakers would prefer to be left out of the fight
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am enormously bothered by what I see as the manipulation of
a 6-year-old boy for political purposes,'' said Sen. John Edwards,
D-N.C., whose GOP colleague, Sen. Jesse Helms, is a chief sponsor
of the citizenship measure. ``If you watch what's going on on
television, it's just obscene.''
</P>
<P>
   THE OTHER WHITE MEAT
</P>
<P>
   U.S. pork producers are fed up.
</P>
<P>
   After presidential candidate George W. Bush referred to
government waste as ``pork'' during a recent debate, the National
Pork Producers Council fired off a respectful letter asking him to
please refrain from employing the slang.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it is time to relegate pork's negative political
connotation to the scrap heap of history once and for all,'' said
the appeal, which went on at length about the nutritional values of
pork. ``Call it waste, call it excess, call it unnecessary spending
_ just don't call it pork.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Bush and other politicians comply and drop a phrase that
has become part of the American lexicon? Fat chance.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST-CLASS TREATMENT?
</P>
<P>
   Getting bumped from a flight is always frustrating. But having
your plane taken away from you is another thing.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Cass Ballenger, R-N.C., said that's exactly what happened
to him when an Air Force jet he and a congressional delegation were
slated to use for a trip to Latin America was commandeered by
Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly what happened,'' said Patrick Murphy, a
spokesman for Ballenger. ``We think it's very unfair that she, for
political business, trumps the official business of a member of
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballenger's party, which included his wife, was forced to take
two smaller Air Force planes for the trip this month, a move he
said ran up the cost for taxpayers by thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign said the first lady had
no control over the Air Force's decision on how to allocate its
planes for congressional travel.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGIOUS OPPOSITION
</P>
<P>
   Conservative House members are heading for a showdown with the
Federal Communication Commission over what they see as an attempt
to limit religious broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 lawmakers are backing legislation to reverse a December
FCC finding that religious programs can no longer be counted toward
a station's educational content. If allowed to stand, such a
position could lead stations to greatly reduce the number of shows
they air with religious themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC decided that it wants to restrict access to religious
messages in favor of what the commission determines to be
educational,'' complained Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   FCC officials say the decision simply clarified long-standing
commission policy and did not create new rules. Lawmakers appear
unwilling to back down, however, and are moving ahead with their
proposal.

 &HT;    The latest from John Grisham: No Davids here, but Goliaths
galore
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If John Grisham's novels have a trademark other than
page-turning plots, it's the presence of an innocent or
semi-innocent protagonist pitted against a larger, more powerful
adversary.
</P>
<P>
   It can be an ambitious, naive lawyer who finds himself working
for the mafia, or a female law student on the run from political
assassins, or a conscientious young lawyer fighting a corrupt
medical establishment.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no Davids in John Grisham's latest thriller. Only
Goliaths. And not very likable Goliaths at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brethren'' (Doubleday, $27.95), which landed in bookstores
Tuesday with the force of a juggernaut, is an intricately plotted
tale of a prison scam involving three convicted judges and a
political campaign orchestrated by the director of the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   The Brethren are three judges who hold court inside a federal
prison in Florida and charge their fellow inmates minimal fees to
settle disputes. Their real money, though, comes from an elaborate
mail-order scheme to extort money from rich, married, closeted gay
men who have responded to a personal ad placed by the judges in a
gay magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, wheelchair-bound CIA Director Teddy Maynard is
conducting a con game of his own. Dissatisfied with America's
shrinking defense budget, Maynard has decided to hand-pick a
candidate and finance his campaign with millions in contributions
from defense contractors. In addition, he plans to create a few
violent incidents around the world to underscore the threat to the
United States and watch his man win by a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   Maynard's candidate is mild-mannered Aaron Lake, a 53-year-old
Arizona congressman with no skeletons in his closet. Well, almost
none. Lake, a widower, was involved in a Whitewater-style land deal
22 years earlier that resulted in his partner being charged with
fraud. And, unbeknownst to Maynard, Lake is about to fall into the
extortion trap set by The Brethren.
</P>
<P>
   The plot takes the traditional twists and turns, and it is clear
that Grisham still has no love for lawyers or a political system
dominated by wealthy contributors. What is missing is someone to
root for _ a damsel in distress, a young attorney on the run. When
the most sympathetic characters are a congressman corrupted by the
offer of a sure ticket to the White House or three convicted judges
who prey on closet gays, the choices are pretty limited.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is likely to bother loyal readers who will snap up
the 2 million-plus copies of this satirical, black-humor thriller.
At
</P>
<P>
   (salinity) See GRISHAM, F5
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Chapter 11 bookstores, owner Barbara Babbitt Kaufman
expects ``The Brethren'' to be her biggest seller of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than his last two books, so I think sales will
skyrocket. I expect to sell 1,000 copies today and 3,000 in the
next couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The figures are impressive, considering J.K. Rowling, author of
the wildly popular Harry Potter books, sold only 1,000 the day she
was at Chapter 11 for a signing.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman acknowledges that there are other authors who are as
good if not better, but Grisham has a certain mystique. ``He has
that mass appeal combined with great marketing. He's a brand
name.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't always the case. When Grisham's first book, ``A Time
to Kill,'' was published in 1987, Wynwood Press printed only 5,000
copies of the novel, most of which ended up in a warehouse. At his
first book signing at Square Books in Oxford, Miss., Grisham
corralled every friend and relative he could find. Even then, only
about 50 people showed up.
</P>
<P>
   After ``The Firm'' became a blockbuster, Grisham sometimes would
sign thousands of books in a five-hour stretch. These days he
limits his signings to the few independent book stores that were
loyal to him before he became famous.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be at Oxford's Square Books on Monday and That Bookstore
in Blytheville, Ark., on Feb. 9, but only the first 200 people with
advance tickets will get their books signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hand out numbers starting at 9 on the morning of the
signing,'' says Lyn Roberts, manager of Square Books. ``A lot of
big-name authors will simply sign their books and not want to talk,
but when John comes, he spends more time visiting. Everybody knows
him and he knows them, or they think he knows them.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, readers who want to get a glimpse of what Grisham can
do when he forgets about the best-seller list should take a look at
the first installment of his six-part serial novel, ``A Painted
House,'' in the January/February issue of The Oxford American
magazine. Partly autobiographical, Grisham's story of a boy growing
up on an Arkansas cotton farm in 1952 is populated with fully
formed characters and laced with wonderful description. And there's
not a lawyer in sight.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST LOOK:
</P>
<P>
   An excerpt from 'The Brethren'
</P>
<P>
   It was a television ad for candidate Lake, and it began with a
brief glimpse of a row of grim Chinese generals standing rigidly at
a military parade, watching massive hardware roll by. ``You think
the world's a safer place?'' a deep, rich ominous voice asked
off-camera. Then, glimpses of the world's current madmen, all
watching their armies parade by _ Hussein, Qaddafi, Milosevic, Kim
in North Korea. Even poor Castro, with the last of his ragtag army
lumbering through Havana, got a split second of airtime. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``China wants to invade Taiwan,'' the voice continued as a
million Chinese soldiers marched in perfect step. ``North Korea
wants South Korea,'' the voice said, as tanks rolled through the
DMZ. ``And the United States is always an easy target. ... ''
</P>
<P>
   The ad went blank, nothing but a dark screen, then the first
voice said, ``Twelve years ago there were two superpowers. Now
there are none.'' The handsome face of Aaron Lake appeared, and the
ad finished with the voice saying, ``Lake, Before It's Too Late.''

(Resending for all needing) By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I recently discovered my hard drive is
partitioned into C:, D: and E: drives. In Explorer, I thought the
D: and E: icons were for future hard-drive installations. My C:
drive is approximately 70 percent full, and D: and E: are virtually
empty. Having the computer literacy of Larry, Moe and Curly
combined, should I dump all my miscellaneous files and software
over to D: and E: and limit C: drive to basic operating system
files?
</P>
<P>
   _ PC Stooge
</P>
<P>
   DEAR STOOGE: Maybe the thing you should dump is your current
operating system. In ancient times, DOS and early versions of
Windows 95 couldn't deal with a hard drive bigger than about 2
gigs. The brainiacs at Microsoft weren't keeping up with the
hardware, but I guess nobody could have expected big hard drives to
get so cheap so soon.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, to compensate for deficiencies in the operating system,
PC makers started carving hard drives into 2-gig partitions. To
you, they look like additional drives.
</P>
<P>
   Setup programs generally want to install software on the C:
drive, but you can almost always override the default without any
problems. If most of your stuff is already installed on C:, try
storing documents and data on D: or E: instead.
</P>
<P>
   But, you know, it's just plain easier if you only have one
partition to worry about. First, upgrade to Win98 so your PC can
handle big partitions. Then take 70 spare bucks and get Partition
Magic (www.powerquest.com), which should be able to redo your drive
without any data loss. Or, you can take the scorched-earth
approach, which consists of using the DOS utility Fdisk (on the
Win98 setup floppy) to remove all your partitions, then creating a
single partition, then reformatting the hard drive, then installing
Win98, then reinstalling all your software. Please don't try any of
this without geek supervision.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I loaded Kiplinger Tax Cut yesterday. There
were several problems, and now, instead of a Task Bar and a Start
button, there's just a slim edging of gray at the bottom. I have
been able to resize the screen and thought the Start button was
lurking below, but apparently not.
</P>
<P>
   _ Start Me Up
</P>
<P>
   DEAR UP: I doubt if the installation was at fault. More likely
it was an errant mouse-stroke while you were busy cursing the
installation program. It's an easy fix, though.
</P>
<P>
   Put your cursor on that thin gray bar until it turns into a
double-headed arrow. Hold down the left mouse button and drag the
cursor up the screen. When you release it, the Task Bar should be
resized and visible again. Why the Microsoft Poindexters would
design a Task Bar that lets you accidentally resize it or move it
to the side of the screen is anybody's guess. Maybe they were bored
that day.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Can you please explain the logic behind the
fact that America Online owns Netscape, yet the default browser
bundled with its software is Internet Explorer? I don't use AOL,
and I know they're goofy as all get-out, but this one really has me
baffled.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mixed Up in Memphis
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MIXED: Logic? Ha ha ha!!! That's a good one!
</P>
<P>
   If I had to guess, though, I'd say it's because of the way
Internet Explorer is built. IE is really just a collection of
function libraries, like a bunch of Legos slapped together to make
a statue of George Washington. Those Legos can be integrated easily
into almost any Windows program, including the AOL software. Why
write your own browser when Microsoft has done it for you?

 &HT;    Timing, technique, equipment are everything when pruning
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hey, you! Yeah, you with that deadly weapon. Drop it.
</P>
<P>
   That is, unless you know when _ and how _ to use it.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking .357s here but something far more lethal when
it comes to your plants _ ignorance, armed with maybe a deafening
chain saw or dull pair of loppers.
</P>
<P>
   The recent bad weather tugged many of us outdoors to repair
damage to trees and shrubs burdened by the weight of ice. For some
homeowners, the experience was just an appetizer. They can't wait,
as the first warm days in February roll around, to get outside and
do something _ anything _ to hurry spring along. Pruning makes us
feel like we're helping, and fortunately, now's the perfect time to
tackle many trees, shrubs and perennials.
</P>
<P>
   Yet every year well-meaning gardeners pick up the shears at the
wrong time. Or use them on the wrong plant. Or make the wrong kind
of cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The keys to proper pruning are timing, technique and the right
equipment,'' said Bob Westerfield, a University of Georgia
Extension horticulturist.
</P>
<P>
   WHY PRUNE
</P>
<P>
   Before you get a grip on those things, understand why pruning is
important. Pruning isn't just a means for helping plants look good
and maintaining a desired size or shape. It also encourages
flowering and fruiting, eliminates diseased or damaged wood, and
promotes overall healthy, vigorous growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, you need to know what happens to a plant when you prune
it,'' said Tom Harvey, grounds supervisor at the Atlanta Botanical
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Hormones determine the plant's growth, and the tip bud, or
highest bud on a shoot, produces two of them. One hormone
encourages the shoot to grow vertically; the other stops dormant
buds below the tip from producing competing shoots. Cutting off the
tip bud stimulates the dormant buds to sprout those new shoots, so
where you cut is important.
</P>
<P>
   In general, avoid pruning in late fall and early winter when
wounds could remain open until spring, inviting moisture that can
lead to disease. Instead, most pruning should wait until late
winter, just before buds awaken from dormancy.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN TO PRUNE
</P>
<P>
   The rule of thumb on timing is to prune summer-flowering plants,
such as crape myrtles and most hydrangeas _ anything that blooms on
new growth _ in January through March before that growth emerges.
Spring-flowering plants, such as forsythia, azaleas and dogwood _
ones that bloom on old wood where buds were set the previous summer
_ should not be pruned until after they bloom.
</P>
<P>
   ``With any plant, you need to know when it blooms so that you
don't sacrifice the blossoms,'' Harvey said. ``If you prune it at
the wrong time, you won't kill the plant but inhibit the blooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Some woody perennials, such as lantana and salvia, have hollow
stems. Wait until late March, when the threat of a late freeze has
passed, before pruning them because moisture can get into the stems
and freeze or attract bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrangeas are less clear cut.
</P>
<P>
   Species such as H. paniculata, the peegee hydrangeas, and H.
arborescens, such as `Annabelle', bloom on new growth, so they
should be pruned in late winter, said Penny McHenry, an Atlanta
hydrangea expert. In late March, she cuts her Annabelles back to
about 8 inches from the ground and the center stems of her peegees
more severely; H. quercifolia, our native oakleaf hydrangea,
require no pruning.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions vary, however, on pruning H. macrophylla, the mophead
and lacecap hydrangeas. McHenry recommends pruning three or four of
the oldest canes on each plant to the ground in late March to let
air and sunlight inside the shrub. She cuts the remaining stems
back to just above where the first green growth is visible.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO PRUNE
</P>
<P>
   One of several pruning techniques will get the job done,
depending on the goal. Pruning to remove dead flowers, or
deadheading, not only improves the appearance of plants but
stimulates new blossoms. Selectively removing buds from a plant
promotes flowering and fruiting in others, which benefit from the
extra nutrients. Sometimes, cutting a shrub to the ground, or
renewal pruning, is the only answer for giving an overgrown,
diseased plant a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   But most pruning, Harvey said, involves one of only two basic
cuts _ heading and thinning.
</P>
<P>
   Heading, or shearing, a tree or shrub simply selectively removes
the outer growing points, thickening the plant into the desired
size and shape, such as a hedge.
</P>
<P>
   Thinning, on the other hand, is the more useful cut, especially
for trees, because the growth is removed at its origin, typically
where a branch emerges from the trunk or the center of the plant.
Selectively removing shoots from the plant's interior allows light
and air to penetrate it, producing a fuller plant and helping
prevent disease and insects. ``The plant also looks more natural
than the meatballs and lollipops you get with heading,'' Harvey
said.
</P>
<P>
   All cuts should be made at a slant, just above the bud, so that
water rolls off the wound.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO USE
</P>
<P>
   At the Atlanta Botanical Garden, where he teaches classes on
pruning, Harvey uses three tools _ hand pruners, loppers and a
pruning saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any job larger is probably best left to an arborist,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hand pruners are best for heading and thinning stems up to about
1 1/2 inches in diameter, or finger size. Loppers are ideal for
selective pruning of larger branches and canes (1 1/2 inches) in
hard-to-reach areas, such as the interior of a shrub. Saws are used
to cut branches more than 2 inches thick.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey recommends investing in tools that will last, maintaining
them with frequent sharpening and proper storage. Expect to pay
about $40 to $50 for quality hand pruners, $50 to $60 for loppers
and $15 to $30 for pruning saws.
</P>
<P>
   What to Prune Now
</P>
<P>
   To remember when to prune plants, know when they bloom.
Typically, trees, shrubs and perennials that bloom in summer on new
growth should be pruned in January through March before that growth
begins. They include:
</P>
<P>
   Beautyberry, Chaste tree (Vitex), Cranberrybush viburnum, Crape
myrtle, Floribunda roses, Fragrant tea olive, Glossy abelia,
Goldenrain tree, Grandiflora roses, Hydrangeas(peegee,
arborescens), Japanese barberry, Japanese spirea, Lantana, Mimosa,
Miscanthus grass, Nandina, Rose of Sharon, Russian sage, Salvia,
Sourwood, Sweetshrub
</P>
<P>
   What to Prune After Flowering
</P>
<P>
   Trees, shrubs and perennials that bloom in spring on old wood
(their buds were set the previous summer) should be pruned by late
summer _ but not until after they bloom. They include: Azalea,
Beautybush, Bradford pear, Bridalwreath spirea, Clematis, Climbing
roses, Crabapple, Deutzia, Dogwood, Doublefile viburnum, Flowering
almond, Flowering cherry, Flowering quince, Forsythia, Japanese
kerria, Japanese pieris, Lilac, Mock orange, Pearlbush, Pyracantha,
Redbud, Saucer magnolia, Shrub honeysuckle, Star magnolia, Thunberg
spirea, Vanhoutte spirea, Weigela, Winter daphne, Winterhazel,
Wisteria

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tasha Smith, cable's newest comedic visionary, was
recently waxing chatty on a question that has long perplexed the
universe: What do women want? The host of a comedy chit-chat show
called TashaVision, Smith gazed around a table of mostly men,
leaned in close, and uttered sweetly, ``We want sex. We want lots
of it. And we want you gone by morning.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the sort of gauzy insight Smith promises will not only
feed her series but will fuel the cable network airing it, the
aimed-at-women channel that has come across as the George W. Bush
of cable newcomers: much talked-about but hardly revealing.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone curious why Oxygen, perhaps the most eagerly awaited
cable channel since CNN and ESPN, is launching in the middle of the
week need only look closer at today's numerical dates.
</P>
<P>
   It's 02/02. Which is the chemical shorthand for Oxygen, you
silly, silly boy.
</P>
<P>
   How cute, how shrewd, how so, well, Oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Debuting to 10 million homes across the United States, Oxygen is
aimed at women from 18 to mid-40s. Women who want to ``re-create
their lives, whether they are stay-at-home moms or upper-level
entrepreneurial managers,'' says founder Geraldine Laybourne.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the buzz about Oxygen, of course, has to do with its
founders' pedigrees, from Laybourne, who built Nickelodeon into an
influential kiddie power, to her big-name partners: Marcy Carsey,
Tom Werner and Caryn Mandabach, producers of such singularly
opinionated fare as The Cosby Show, Roseanne and Grace Under Fire;
and the diva of daytime, Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   The other part is because the media dearly loves a catfight,
particularly when the cats are wearing high heels. You see, to win
its targeted turf, Oxygen must go through Lifetime _ the
often-maligned (its critics say its programming is dumbed down and
condescending to women) but entrenched female-skewing network that
reaches nearly every U.S. household wired for cable. (Lifetime is
available in 75 million households, sixth among cable channels.)
</P>
<P>
   With offices and studios in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New
York City, Oxygen will be a 24-hour venture with lofty goals, the
least of which is to combine advocacy, technology and creativity
centered on ``the upliftment of women.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder its programs sound like social gatherings. Pajama
Party is a weekly late-night talk and variety show; Trackers is an
afternoon series where teen-age girls with digital cameras create
episodes dealing with fashion, movies and boys; We Sweat is a
sports programming block; and ka-Ching explores financial matters
for a group that's now 52 percent of the workforce.
</P>
<P>
   Candice Bergen (Murphy Brown) will host a late-evening talk show
(9 p.m., against some of prime time's best dramas) that looks to
take the high road. Announced guests for Exhale With Candice Bergen
include Madeleine K. Albright, architect Frank Gehry and Tina
Turner.
</P>
<P>
   On paper at least, Oxygen presents a sharp contrast to Lifetime,
whose reliance on network reruns like Designing Women and
victim-to-victor made-for-TV movies has given it a reputation for
old-school submissiveness. (Every Saturday night Oxygen will,
however, screen a classic film from the '30s, '40s or '50s. But
even that carries the playful title of A Girl in the Picture.)
</P>
<P>
   Early on, it seemed as though Laybourne was positioning Oxygen
as the smug, intellectual Lifetime _ her quote, actually, was
something about Lifetime attracting ``passive viewers,'' which is
something she simply wouldn't stand for. Bergen's Exhale is a good
example of this high-mindedness, as are Inhale, an early-morning
half-hour of yoga, and the network's plans to meld television with
the interactivity of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites, which will be integrated with the network's shows,
are already up and running, and Winfrey is hosting a series geared
toward learning how the Internet works.
</P>
<P>
   Oprah Goes Online, airing Sundays, will detail how the talk host
is learning to work the Internet _ it's ``Internet for Dummies''
brought to life. (Speaking of Winfrey, Oxygen will also have access
to 3,000 hours of her talk show beginning in 2002.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to appeal to a demographic'' is how Marcy
Carsey put it, ``but a psychographic.''
</P>
<P>
   That's smart, considering that half the population shouldn't be
considered a niche anyway. Which is why Laybourne is either
mistaken or wildly optimistic in thinking women are somehow
underserved by television.
</P>
<P>
   Women are the mainstays of network television. Many prime-time
shows are geared toward them, precisely because men have proven so
consistently elusive. Women are the primary audience for many
popular series, such as Providence, Judging Amy and Once and Again.
Plus, a number of cable networks are already aimed at segments of
the women's market, such as the Food Network, Home &AMP; Garden
Television, E! Entertainment, Romance Classics and American Movie
Classics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the women behind Oxygen are awesome, extraordinarily
talented and have been very successful,'' says Carole Black,
Lifetime's president and CEO. ``But we've had more competitors than
we can count, people who maybe aren't tagged `television for women'
but clearly are for women. Last year we had our best year. So it
seems that all we're doing, and what Oxygen will do, is simply
bring more women to TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Black also knows that it will take years for Oxygen to find
enough cable operators willing and able to carry the network to
keep it in business. Many, like Fort Worth's Charter, have little
or no available space; to add Oxygen would mean dropping another
channel, which almost always brings the cable system grief from
that channel's fans.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen needs to build a base fast; major advertisers don't start
taking you seriously until you've reached 30 million subscribers.
And though Laybourne projects 50 million households in five years,
right now, Oxygen isn't even in New York or Los Angeles _ the
markets that often set the tone for the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that's certain about any new operation,'' Laybourne
says, ``is that none of it is ever etched in stone. We need to try
and see what works, and doesn't work, and continue to program
accordingly. I can't assure you that anything that's on now will be
on later because after we get feedback from the audience, we'll see
how to proceed.'' &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS) &QL; 
(MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Addressing her viewership directly is the strength of Laybourne,
who rose to the top job at Nickelodeon after impressing the then
little-known network with a pilot idea. Armed with a master's
degree in elementary education from the University of Pennsylvania,
she started a production company with her husband, Kit, a
filmmaker, until Nick wanted her full time.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 16 years she helped build Nick into a monster of a
cable service, gambling on mold-breaking shows like Rugrats and The
Secret World of Alex Mack, shows praised for refusing to talk down
to kids.
</P>
<P>
   The same philosophy is being used with Oxygen, which, judging
from its schedule thus far, is serious about zeroing in on issues
affecting women.
</P>
<P>
   Even Pajama Party will have a sense of purpose beyond girly
talk. ``Will it be a chatty atmosphere? Most certainly,'' says
Laybourne. ``But the topics will be pretty wide-ranging and pretty
intellectual in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   But Laybourne will be the first to tell you that Oxygen is the
anti-corporate corporation, a place where if the key word isn't
fun, then they probably won't be all that creative or successful.
</P>
<P>
   Tasha Smith, the comedian, says she's proud to be on Oxygen, a
channel that reflects her ideals, one of strong women. She asked
whether anyone had seen the channel's new commercial, which aired
during the second half of Sunday's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It featured a baby girl tossing out her pink cap and, after the
rest of the girl babies follow her lead, the tiny tot raises a fist
in the air.
</P>
<P>
   As in girl power.
</P>
<P>
   Says Smith, smiling: ``It was soooo Oxygen.''

   From the TV show to the movie to the Cartman coffee mugs you can
pick up at the dollar store, there's just no avoiding South Park.
So until the next offensive cartoon that kids love and parents
loathe comes along, get used to this one.
</P>
<P>
   South Park has already invaded the video-game world via a string
of titles, none of which are hardly worth remembering, much less
buying. I got one South Park Nintendo 64 game in the mail that was
so bad, I sent it back. And I don't even send 'N Sync records back.
</P>
<P>
   But Acclaim and Comedy Central have teamed up for the quite
amusing South Park Rally ($55), one of this winter's most
anticipated PlayStation titles. And before I begin the praising, I
gotta warn parents: It's just like the show, full of potty-mouth
language. Think twice, in other words, before you buy this for your
12-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   South Park Rally is as simple as it is self-explanatory. Gamers
pick their fave South Park character _ including, how hilarious,
Starvin' Marvin and Terrance and Phillip _ and race around the
town, trying to beat the clock as well as other racers. It's not
really different than Mario's kart-racers.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but then again, it is. You can stick to the Championship
mode and race other players, but the real fun comes during a slew
of race missions that are based on South Park story lines.
Definitely one of the funniest ones is the mad cow race in which
all the players have mad cow disease but there's only enough
antidote for one racer; gotta ram the other racers to get it, and
when you bump 'em, they yell out their catch-phrases, most of which
we can't print here.
</P>
<P>
   The more missions you conquer, the more racetracks and
characters you unlock. And the really cool thing about South Park
Rally _ this is the one time when Kenny doesn't have to die. ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Whoa, does Ghosts 'N Goblins (Capcom for Gameboy Color, $40)
bring back memories of yesteryear, back when I had a sane
girlfriend, a bright future as a restaurant manager and nary a
cutoff notice. Boy, sure am glad I took this newspaper job!
</P>
<P>
   G&AMP;G harks back to the days when someone's high-school-notebook
doodles passed for decent graphics. Those days were actually a lot
better than now, since killer graphics often sub for a killer game.
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly killer, but G&AMP;G does meet the basic good-vidgame
requirements: It's challenging and fun, and it doesn't have the
word ``Sonic'' in it.
</P>
<P>
   Players control Sir Arthur (or some little white thing that's
supposed to be Sir Arthur), who's out to save Guinevere from, well,
ghosts and goblins. Translation: Walk left to right, battle stuff,
repeat 30 times. Senseless fun never gets old.

   The New York Times News Service will move the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, Feb. 6,
2000. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category) &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SUNDANCE-FILMS (Park City, Utah) _ This year's Sundance film
festival, which ended its 10-day run here a week ago, was widely
viewed as among the most successful of recent years with fresh and
surprising entries in all of the festival's categories. By Rick
Lyman. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FRENCH-WOMEN-FILMS (Undated) _ The French, a stubborn people,
may be the last nation on earth for who the ``magic'' of women is a
simple, unshakable article of faith. The French Institute/Alliance
Francaise in New York is currently conducting a kind of revival
meeting devoted to reasserting this durable tenet of the national
religion (i.e., the cinema) in the form of a 10-film tribute to
Carol Bouquet, Sandrine Bonnaire and Juliette Binoche. Strictly
speaking, these women have little in common. But if you compare
them with American actresses of similar accomplishment (say, Julia
Roberts, Meg Ryan and Michelle Pfeiffer) you can't help noticing
that the Frenchwomen are, collectively, a much graver and more
mysterious bunch. By Terrence Rafferty. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DOROTHY-ARZNER-FILMS (Undated) _ Three days into the last
century, the wife of a San Francisco cafe owner gave birth to a
child who would grow up to be the lone female filmmaker of
Hollywood's golden era. Dorothy Arzner will not receive a fraction
of the tributes accorded that other recent centenarian, Alfred
Hitchcock. But Arzner warrants a place in film history, and not
simply because she broke into the super-macho profession that movie
directing was in the '30s and '40s. Looked at today, Arzner's films
are startling in their pre-feminist probings of women's place in
American society. By Graham Fuller. WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KATHLEEN-MARSHALL-DANCE (New York) _ In her three and a half
years as the artistic director of the Encores musical concert
series, the choreographer Kathleen Marshall has become something of
an expert in the fine art of instant entertainment. Productions at
Encores, after all, rarely rehearse for more than 10 days before
showing off the results for 3,000 spectators a night at City
Center. So imagine her surprise last fall when she found herself
working on the revival of ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' a project two years in
the making whose rehearsal schedule stretched out over six weeks, a
period unthinkable for any Encores veteran. By Jesse McKinley. WITH
PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BLACK-DANCE (New York) _ The arts organization 651 ARTS, which
was founded in part by the Brooklyn Academy of Music and identifies
itself as an African-American performing arts presenter, will
feature a dance program called ``Black Dance: Tradition and
Transformation'' that runs Feb. 16 through 19 at the BA M's Harvey
Theater, the headquarters of 651. The new yearly series will
examine the past, present and future of black choreography with
performances, master classes, lectures and discussions. By Jennifer
Dunning. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BRAZILIAN-DANCE-TROUPE (New York) _ Since the Brazilian
choreographer Deborah Colker established her dance troupe in Rio de
Janeiro in 1994, it has attracted enormous audiences. Her sleek,
14-member Companhia de Danca Deborah Colker makes its North
American debut at the Joyce Theater Feb. 15 through 20 with the
full-evening work ``Rota'' (``Route''), a hit in South America and
Europe that has been seen by more than 200,000 people since 1997.
By Valerie Gladstone. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JAPANESE-DANCE-TROUPE (New York) _ You've probably heard that
you can't put your elbow in your ear. Well, don't tell it to H Art
Chaos, an all-female dance group from Japan. A seeming hybrid of
Pilobolus and Gumby, these 11 hyperlimber women have complete
disregard for the laws of physical possibility: they hang from
their heels, pirouette at whiplash speed, writhe convulsively on
the floor, launch themselves violently into the air and
occasionally fly around the stage carrying chairs and sometimes one
another. This apotheosis of energy can be experienced Tuesday
through Sunday at the Joyce Theater in ``Secret Club _ Floating
Angels 2000,'' a highly theatrical 80-minute work, much praised in
Japan, that has been evolving since 1993. By Annette Grant. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DUBLIN-CAROL-THEATER (London) _ ``Dublin Carol,'' is an
impressive new play by Conor McPherson, 28, the Irish author of
``The Weir.'' Partly because of its own undoubted quality, partly
because the earlier work has enjoyed such success in London and New
York, this is the piece that was to have reopened the Royal Court
Theater, which has been closed for nearly four years for a
$40-million-plus refit. But the most reliable member of any team of
British contractors is the gremlin. Building problems have caused
delays, and delays have temporarily banished Ian Rickson's
sensitive production of ``Dublin Carol'' to the Old Vic. By
Benedict Nightingale. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JANE-EYRE-THEATER (London) _ What is left to discover about
``Jane Eyre'' after at least four film versions and various
important critical writings, not to mention Charlotte Bronte's 1847
novel itself? If you are in the theater, perhaps it is the
opportunity to physicalize the book while animating its
time-honored passions anew. That seems to be the case with Polly
Teale, the adapter and director of Shared Experience's stage
production of the novel that arrives on Tuesday at the Brooklyn
Academy of Music in New York. By Matt Wolf. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ONE-MINUTE-MUSIC (New York) _ How little does it take? How much
can it bear? Guy Livingston played 36 one-minute piano pieces at
the Miller Theater not long ago. I went to Livingston's recital
hoping for revelation. Could the tiny gesture yield the big
statement? Not here, I am afraid. Most of these pieces, despite the
performer's protestations, took their mission as a joke. Some were
amusing, and the few with furrowed brow never quite justified their
serious intent. Maybe the composers were not good enough, or maybe
a minute is not enough. By Bernard Holland. WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-COMPANIES-MERGERS (Undated) _ It's not even Valentine's
Day, but recording companies are getting mightly cuddly. Universal
Music, owned by Seagram along with Universal's movie and television
companies, swallowed Polygram in 1998, and late last year Time
Warner announced plans to merge with America Online. Then, in
January Time Warner announced it intended to take control of EMI
Music. Meanwhile, reports continue to circulate that BMG is
negotiating to buy Sony Music. That eventuality would swiftly halve
the number of major recording companies, from six in 1998 to three
by 2001. By Jon Pareles. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KIDS-IN-THE-HALL (Toronto) _ Five years after their
sketch-comedy show, ``The Kids in the Hall,'' went off the air,
Mark McKinney, Dave Foley, Scott Thompson, Bruce McCulloch and
Kevin McDonald have reunited for an 18-city tour of the United
States and their native Canada. During those years a strange thing
has happened: these cult comedians seem to have become quasi-rock
stars, with enough fans to fill a 2,600-seat Toronto theater for
three nights, a 4,000-seater in Chicago and seven sold-out shows at
Town Hall in New York from Feb. 9 to 13. By Rick Marin. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ROYAL-EXCAVATION-CORPS-ART (Undated) _ The exhibitions that
chronicle the activities of the Royal Excavation Corps, a shadowy
organization formed by demobilized officers in the years following
World War I and involved in everything from intelligence gathering
to archaeology to parapsychology, constitute a compelling if little
known slice of history. Among the expeditions the corps
scrupulously recorded in panoramic photographs and firsthand
accounts were an attempted trans-Atlantic flight that ended in
disaster and a secret mission to Siberia in the closing months of
the war. By Miles Unger. WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TV-STREET-HOMICIDE (Hollywood) _ For seven years, ``Homicide:
Life on the Street'' struggled to survive. The ensemble show about
homicide detectives in Baltimore had few car chases or shootouts.
There was little of the sexual drama of the far more successful
``N.Y.P.D. Blue.'' And the show's time slot, Friday night at 10,
was hardly choice. But by the time the series ended last August _
it had won three Peabody Awards and earned three Emmy's. By Bernard
Weinraub. &QL;

   SCHOOL-HOMELESS _ WASHINGTON _ It's hard to educate homeless
kids. Lack of transportation from the shelter is the biggest
barrier to attending their old school. Misplaced birth certificates
and shot records make it hard to get them into another school near
the shelter. That is to be reported Tuesday by the National Center
on Homelessness and Poverty, a few hours before the Urban Institute
issues its annual national estimates of the number of homeless
children and adults. (Mollison, Cox News Service). 14.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-SESSION _ WASHINGTON _ U.S. lawmakers are planning the
shortest work year in three decades this year. The House has
scheduled only 118 days in session, 10 with no roll-call votes.
With long breaks for holidays, Congress will also take August off
for the national party conventions and then aim to fold their tent
for the year by Oct. 6. Arguably, that's not bad work for $141,300
a year. It's not the number of legislative days but the quality of
the legislation, says the House speaker's press secretary. (Malone,

<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; `ANONYMOUS' STRIKES AGAIN? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Joe Klein &LR; , who now writes for the New Yorker and who, as
Anonymous, wrote ``Primary Colors,'' has finished ``The Running
Mate,'' a novel to be published in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primary Colors'' was a devastating portrait of a  &UR; Bill &LR; 
 &UR; Clinton &LR; -like candidate; Klein was covering Clinton for Newsweek
when he wrote the book.
</P>
<P>
   The leading character in the new book, says the New York Daily
News, is a Vietnam War hero who becomes a candidate. The author has
been covering  &UR; John McCain &LR; 's campaign for the New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Dial Press is reported to have paid the author an advance of
more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ADVICE FOR THE &LR;   &UR; CANDIDATE'S DAUGHTER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Karenna Gore Schiff &LR; , 26-year-old daughter of the vice
president and his ``secret weapon'' for luring young voters, is
getting advice from one of Gore's top advisers, reports Harper's
Bazaar. Feminist author  &UR; Naomi Wolf &LR; , who famously told the veep to
wear earth colors, has sometimes marked the text of young Schiff's
speeches to help her in delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pre-speech instructions, as cited by reporter
 &UR; Melinda Henneberger &LR;  in the magazine: ``Pause, eye contact, sweet
smile ... Pause, make eye contact, move a step or two, breathe
deeply once, take a new breath, begin.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHOWING DOWN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Today, February 2, is California Kiwifruit Day. The date was
chosen, says &UR; Scott Horsfall &LR; , president of the California Kiwifruit
Commission, because ``a small child aptly remarked that a kiwi
looked just like a groundhog.''
</P>
<P>
   - Fitness trainers work out an average of 13 hours a week,
reports Health magazine, which cites a survey of 148 trainers in
which 64 percent wanted to be thinner.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the magazine, a report on British researchers who
found that women on crash diets had 30 percent slower reaction
times _ that means they seemed less smart _ than those eating
regularly and that young girls with eating disorders acted out
aggressively four times as often as young girls who ate normally.
</P>
<P>
   - Noting that ``Dieting With the Duchess'' is now available in
paperback, a Berkeley reader wondering how to choose between the
Fergie diet and the Monica diet prophesies a Monica diet book fer
sure.
</P>
<P>
   - In response to the California Prune Board's revelation that it
wants to abandon the word ``prune'' in favor of ``dried plums,''
 &UR; Walt Shugert  &LR; suggests ``the fruit formerly known as prunes.''
</P>
<P>
   - For help in menu planning, homemakers might want to consult
the Web site of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, which
lists the last meal selections of 204 people executed in that state
since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   - More on pretzels replacing peanuts as airline fare:  &UR; Jim
Dwyer &LR;  is mourning Hawaiian Airlines replacement of macadamia nuts
with pretzels, which he stresses is ``not just a macademic
question. If it were, I wouldn't have spent my entire week in Kauai
searching for the Rold Gold plantation.''
</P>
<P>
   - And reading America West magazine on a flight a few weeks ago,
 &UR; Julie Orringer &LR;  came upon a story citing a La Jolla restaurant's
``Thai curry soup with Shiite mushrooms.'' She's hoping she can
order some ``some Islamic vinegar with that.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; APOLOGIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Artist  &UR; Kirsten Janese-Nelson &LR;  is planning an installation in
San Francisco that will feature numbers of letters of apology:
``for actions we regret, words we never expressed, letters we never
sent.'' She's asking for handwritten or typed anonymous letters of
apology of any sort, which can be sent to Apologia, P.O. Box
190456, San Francisco, CA 94119-0456; for more information, e-mail
her at &LR;   &LR; apologia &LR; slip.net.
</P>
<P>
   And regarding Trader Joe's capers,  &UR; King Simon &LR;  points out that
the label doesn't say they're a product of the Mediterranean; it
says they are harvested ``from a prickly shrub native to the
Mediterranean.'' So Joe, Personals says it ain't so.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important eating etiquette is to never, and I mean
never, use the side of your knife to look to see if you have food
wedged in your teeth. A knife is not a mirror. Never turn it
sideways to see your reflection when eating, not even on a
picnic.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  -  &LR; Actor  &UR; Stanley Tucci &LR;  to  &UR; Baird Jones &LR;  at a party in New
York for ``The Two of Us,'' which will be broadcast on VH1 on
Saturday.

<P>
   &UR; `ANONYMOUS' STRIKES AGAIN? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Joe Klein &LR; , who now writes for the New Yorker and who, as
Anonymous, wrote ``Primary Colors,'' has finished ``The Running
Mate,'' a novel to be published in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primary Colors'' was a devastating portrait of a  &UR; Bill &LR; 
 &UR; Clinton &LR; -like candidate; Klein was covering Clinton for Newsweek
when he wrote the book.
</P>
<P>
   The leading character in the new book, says the New York Daily
News, is a Vietnam War hero who becomes a candidate. The author has
been covering  &UR; John McCain &LR; 's campaign for the New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Dial Press is reported to have paid the author an advance of
more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ADVICE FOR THE &LR;   &UR; CANDIDATE'S DAUGHTER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Karenna Gore Schiff &LR; , 26-year-old daughter of the vice
president and his ``secret weapon'' for luring young voters, is
getting advice from one of Gore's top advisers, reports Harper's
Bazaar. Feminist author  &UR; Naomi Wolf &LR; , who famously told the veep to
wear earth colors, has sometimes marked the text of young Schiff's
speeches to help her in delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pre-speech instructions, as cited by reporter
 &UR; Melinda Henneberger &LR;  in the magazine: ``Pause, eye contact, sweet
smile ... Pause, make eye contact, move a step or two, breathe
deeply once, take a new breath, begin.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHOWING DOWN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Today, February 2, is California Kiwifruit Day. The date was
chosen, says &UR; Scott Horsfall &LR; , president of the California Kiwifruit
Commission, because ``a small child aptly remarked that a kiwi
looked just like a groundhog.''
</P>
<P>
   - Fitness trainers work out an average of 13 hours a week,
reports Health magazine, which cites a survey of 148 trainers in
which 64 percent wanted to be thinner.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the magazine, a report on British researchers who
found that women on crash diets had 30 percent slower reaction
times _ that means they seemed less smart _ than those eating
regularly and that young girls with eating disorders acted out
aggressively four times as often as young girls who ate normally.
</P>
<P>
   - Noting that ``Dieting With the Duchess'' is now available in
paperback, a Berkeley reader wondering how to choose between the
Fergie diet and the Monica diet prophesies a Monica diet book fer
sure.
</P>
<P>
   - In response to the California Prune Board's revelation that it
wants to abandon the word ``prune'' in favor of ``dried plums,''
 &UR; Walt Shugert  &LR; suggests ``the fruit formerly known as prunes.''
</P>
<P>
   - For help in menu planning, homemakers might want to consult
the Web site of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, which
lists the last meal selections of 204 people executed in that state
since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   - More on pretzels replacing peanuts as airline fare:  &UR; Jim
Dwyer &LR;  is mourning Hawaiian Airlines replacement of macadamia nuts
with pretzels, which he stresses is ``not just a macademic
question. If it were, I wouldn't have spent my entire week in Kauai
searching for the Rold Gold plantation.''
</P>
<P>
   - And reading America West magazine on a flight a few weeks ago,
 &UR; Julie Orringer &LR;  came upon a story citing a La Jolla restaurant's
``Thai curry soup with Shiite mushrooms.'' She's hoping she can
order some ``some Islamic vinegar with that.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; APOLOGIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Artist  &UR; Kirsten Janese-Nelson &LR;  is planning an installation in
San Francisco that will feature numbers of letters of apology:
``for actions we regret, words we never expressed, letters we never
sent.'' She's asking for handwritten or typed anonymous letters of
apology of any sort, which can be sent to Apologia, P.O. Box
190456, San Francisco, CA 94119-0456; for more information, e-mail
her at &LR;   &LR; apologia &LR; slip.net.
</P>
<P>
   And regarding Trader Joe's capers,  &UR; King Simon &LR;  points out that
the label doesn't say they're a product of the Mediterranean; it
says they are harvested ``from a prickly shrub native to the
Mediterranean.'' So Joe, Personals says it ain't so.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important eating etiquette is to never, and I mean
never, use the side of your knife to look to see if you have food
wedged in your teeth. A knife is not a mirror. Never turn it
sideways to see your reflection when eating, not even on a
picnic.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  -  &LR; Actor  &UR; Stanley Tucci &LR;  to  &UR; Baird Jones &LR;  at a party in New
York for ``The Two of Us,'' which will be broadcast on VH1 on
Saturday.

FAULTY COMPUTER COMPONENT PROMPTS NASA TO POSTPONE SHUTTLE LAUNCH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ NASA postponed the launch of the shuttle
Endeavour's 11-day radar mapping mission Tuesday until early next
week so ground teams can replace a faulty computer component.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle managers hope Endeavour can be readied for liftoff at
12:08 a.m. EST Feb. 9 from the Kennedy Space Center. However,
Boeing also is considering a communications satellite launch on an
expendable rocket on the same day. Both operations require
exclusive use of the same Air Force radar tracking network.
</P>
<P>
   If the space agency and Boeing do not reach a schedule
agreement, the Air Force will establish the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to launch Endeavour on Monday were scrubbed by rainy
weather and a computer problem that surfaced during the countdown.
When shuttle managers were unable to pin down the cause of the
technical difficulty, they scrapped tentative plans to try again
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The errant hardware is the master events controller, an
electronics assembly about the size of a videotape recorder that
dispatches commands issued by the shuttle's primary computer. Those
commands ignite the twin solid-fuel rocket boosters at liftoff.
During the climb to orbit, the controller paces the jettisoning of
the boosters and the shuttle's big external fuel tank.
</P>
<P>
   The controller failed to respond correctly to a routine command
test during Monday's countdown. A similar difficulty forced a
week's postponement of another shuttle mission in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Each shuttle is equipped with a primary and backup controller.
NASA flight rules require that each of the controllers work
properly at liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour commander Kevin Kregel, pilot Dominic ``Dom'' Gorie,
flight engineer Janet Kavandi, and mission specialists Janice Voss,
Mamoru Mohri of Japan and Gerhard Thiele of Germany were to leave
Florida on Wednesday for Houston, where they will resume training
at the Johnson Space Center.

   `` Needles unblock pathways through which the vital energy
called Qi flows,'' says acupuncturist Henry Woo, Ph.D., of Newport
Beach, Calif. ``Traditional Chinese Medicine treats a wide variety
of conditions this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Best known for relieving pain, acupuncture's uses in the West
keep expanding. Inserting needles into pressure points throughout
the body to increase well-being goes back more than 2,500 years.
</P>
<P>
   But using the hair-thin needles to accentuate beauty represents
a whole new concept in cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The needles stimulate circulation and tone the muscles
underneath the skin,'' says Woo. ``Stimulating energy centers
restores the Yin/Yang, or balance of energy in the body.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased,'' says Sandy Ridout of Huntington Beach,
California. ``I can see that the fine lines under my eyes lessened,
and my smile lines diminished a lot. I'm most pleased about that.''
</P>
<P>
   COSMETIC ACUPUNCTURE
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners assert that lines around the eyes, and wrinkles
that form around the mouth respond quickly to acupuncture
treatments. But inviting as the treatment seems, not many
acupuncturists offer it, says Woo, because of the time involved.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to cosmetic therapy, Woo treats a host of disorders
with acupuncture, including addictions, weight problems, pain,
adult acne, bedwetting and even infertility. ``It opens the
channels through which energy flows, and rejuvenates the body's
cells. The improvement shows in the face by relaxing and
strengthening the muscles below the skin, which helps eliminate
wrinkles.''
</P>
<P>
   Since people often fear needles, Woo uses techniques to ease
their anxiety. ``I help patients overcome their fear of needles by
first showing them that I use very fine, disposable needles made of
steel. They don't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Background music and dim lighting further the relaxed
atmosphere. The number of needles that Woo uses can vary from
patient to patient. Some require as few as nine, and others need 16
or so placed strategically around their face. ``The needles bring
more circulation to the area where they are inserted,'' says Woo,
``which brings more rejuvenating oxygen to the cells. The needles
activate the fiber under the skin too, and give it more
elasticity.''
</P>
<P>
   NEEDLE PLACEMENT
</P>
<P>
   After Woo cleans the patient's face with alcohol, he uses tape
to put pressure on the muscles. Anesthesia cream is applied to the
sensitive lip area to avoid discomfort. Then he inserts the needles
at angles of less than 15 degrees, mostly pointing toward the top
of the head. This takes about 15 minutes, and the needles remain in
place for about a half hour.
</P>
<P>
   Woo also inserts two needles into the hand to stimulate
circulation to the face. ``It's the same pressure point used to
stop a toothache or a headache,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Woo cleanses the face again with alcohol after removing the
needles, and massages the patient's face for about five minutes. A
Chinese cream restores moisture and nourishes the skin. Ten
treatments usually do the job. Then, maintenance visits once or
twice a month renew the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   EASY TO KEEP UP
</P>
<P>
   Much cheaper than a surgical facelift, patients pay about $45
for each acupuncture treatment. Woo explains that restoring the
essential energy, or Qi, (pronounced chee) improves mood and
increases a sense of well being. This shows in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes patients experience a momentary stinging or tingling
sensation when needles are inserted,'' he says. ``That is then
followed by a complete sense of relaxation and ease.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaking up energy stagnation and restoring a balanced flow of
Qi through the body represents a radically different approach to
achieving beauty than a surgical facelift. The focus on the whole
person and improving energy flow appeals to many.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I understand, surgical facelifts last 10 or 12 years
even if you have good skin tone,'' says Sandy Ridout, ``which I do.
Eventually, I'll probably have a facelift like that. But if I can
put it off, that's a good idea, I think. Acupuncture seems like a
better way to get rid of wrinkles right now because it's easy to
keep up. And there's no pain involved, or recuperation time. I
enjoy the procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   ACUPUNCTURE USED WIDELY
</P>
<P>
   A consensus statement from the National Institutes of Health
states that acupuncture has been used by millions of Americans.
Thousands of physicians, dentists, and other practitioners have
used acupuncture for the relief of pain, and many other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Since the field still remains relatively new to the public,
issues such as training, licensure, and insurance coverage need
further clarification. The majority of states offer licensure or
registration for acupuncturists, but not all states recognize the
same credentialing exam. A nationally recognized exam has been
established, however, for physicians who become acupuncturists.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Food and Drug Administration recently removed
acupuncture needles from the category of ``experimental medical
devices,'' and now regulates them just like surgical scalpels and
hypodermic syringes. This ensures good manufacturing practices and
high standards of sterility. The FDA recommends that the needles be
used only once.
</P>
<P>
   The NIH consensus statement lists many health problems that
acupuncture may help mitigate including addiction, rehabilitation
after stoke, headaches, menstrual cramps, myofascial pain, back
pain, asthma, osteoarthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome and
fibromyalgia. The consensus panel concluded that further research
is likely to uncover additional areas where acupuncture
interventions will be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture's positive effects seem to radiate in an all
encompassing way for some patients. ``I feel like I'm brighter,''
says Sandy Ridout. ``It gives me a better feeling just to know I
don't have wrinkles. ``I'm a preventive type person, and my
appearance and my mood are important to me. I needed a perker-upper
and this is it.''

 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 WATSONVILLE, Calif. _  Crisp and juicy, with a definitive bite,
fresh radishes satisfy our taste for crunch, and with almost no
calories.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dipped in salt and savored with fresh bread and sweet butter,
they launch many a French picnic and family meal. Cut into
decorative roses, they dress up platters of cold cuts or salads.
Pickled, they play a significant role in traditional Japanese
meals.
</P>
<P>
   Today, California growers are expanding the selection of
radishes beyond the familiar round red globe. At Stone Free Farm in
Watsonville, Stuart Dickson revels in radishes that are out of the
ordinary. His annual harvest includes novelties such as the Chinese
watermelon radish, a baseball-size radish with green skin, red
flesh and a mild flavor; the black Spanish radish, popular among
his farmers' markets customers from Russia and Iran; and the purple
plum radish, with its stunning magenta color and sweet nature.
</P>
<P>
   Over the growing season, he'll farm three to four acres of
French breakfast radishes _ the slender, elongated ones with white
bottoms and red shoulders. He also grows daikon, the Japanese
favorite; and strawberry daikon, a particularly crisp, sweet
variety with fuchsia skin and white flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Like other root vegetables and some winter greens, the
watermelon and black Spanish radishes not only tolerate the cold _
they like it. A little frost makes them sweet, Dickson says. Once
harvested, these outsized radishes will last for up to six months
if stored at 34 degrees. Dickson likes them with black bread,
butter, Munster cheese, beer and a shot of schnapps. He also roasts
watermelon radishes in their skin, like beets, seasoning them with
sesame oil, soy sauce and sesame seeds.
</P>
<P>
   The French breakfast and salad radishes are seeded from
mid-January until November. In only three weeks they can be on the
table, ready for dipping in extra virgin olive oil or a creamy
hummus, or for garnishing a nicoise salad.
</P>
<P>
   Growers like Dickson keep their fingers crossed that these
fast-growing roots will mature in mild weather. Hot weather can
make them unpleasantly spicy, and deep cracks usually mean they
received too much water at one time and went from dry to wet too
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   At the market, shoppers should inspect the larger radishes, such
as daikon, for firmness; leave soft ones behind, Dickson says.
Salad radishes and breakfast radishes should be on the small side;
larger ones may be hollow.
</P>
<P>
   To revive limp-leaved radishes, soak them in cold water for 10
to 15 minutes, leaves and all. Dickson recommends storing them in a
plastic tray with vents, with dampened cheesecloth or a paper towel
over them. They also keep well if treated like flowers: Put the
roots in a glass of water, cover the glass loosely with a plastic
bag and refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Stone Free Farm's specialty radishes are available at the &LR; 
 &LR; Ferry Plaza Farmers' Market in San Francisco and at the Palo &LR; 
 &LR; Alto and Menlo Park farmers' markets. They also are available &LR;   &LR; at
Real Food, Whole Foods and Wild Oats markets, harvest &LR;   &LR; permitting.

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Personal Taste Rules On the Chowder Front  By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Rich, hot clam chowder seems like the perfect cure
for a cold, rainy day _ or does it?
<P>
   Today's panel tasted 10 canned clam chowders but couldn't agree
on which they liked best. With every soup tasted, some ranked it
high while others scored it low. So most soups ended up with
relatively low rankings.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason, panelists said, is personal preference. Some
prefer it thick and chunky, others like it smooth and creamy. Some
of the soups were condensed; others were ready to eat. All were
prepared according to package directions.
</P>
<P>
   The winner was  &UR; Snow's condensed &LR;  (15 ounces, $1.59-$1.79 at
many supermarkets). Two panelists liked the flavor, but all noted
the soup's thin texture. Others disliked the lack of substantial
pieces of clams and potatoes, one writing, ``not enough stuff.''.
Three would buy it, one might buy it and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to another variety from the same company _
 &UR; Snow's ready-to-serve &LR;  (15 ounces, $1.69 at Safeway). Unlike its
counterpart, this soup was very thick. Two panelists liked the
chunky texture, but another described the chowder as deceiving:
``Looks great, but very bland and underseasoned.'' Two would buy
it, one might buy it and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pepperidge Farms &LR;  (101/2 ounces, $2.09-$3.69 at many
supermarkets) was third. Two panelists liked the clam flavor, one
thought there wasn't enough flavor and another described it as too
fishy. Panelists were also divided on texture. Two would buy it;
three would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Campbell's condensed &LR;  (103/4 ounces, $1.35 at many
supermarkets) came in fourth. Two panelists thought this soup
tasted more of potatoes than clams, but others liked the clam
flavor. One panelist commented on the undercooked texture of the
potatoes. One would buy it, one might buy it, and three would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth place went to  &UR; Campbell's &LR;   &UR; Select &LR;  (19 ounces,
$2.29-$2.49 at many supermarkets). Three panelists thought the soup
was far too thick, one saying a spoon could stand up in it, another
describing it as more like gravy.
</P>
<P>
   Others liked the sweet vegetable and clam flavor. One would buy
it, one might buy it and three would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Wolfgang Puck's, Bookbinder's, Campbell's
Chunky, Jake's and Progresso, but they scored too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Panelists were Lynne Bennett, California Culinary Academy &LR; 
 &LR; graduate; John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Marc Halperin, &LR; 
 &LR; culinary director, Center for Culinary Development; Lesli &LR; 
 &LR; Neilson, Chronicle staff writer, Roland Passot, chef-owner, La &LR;

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Salmon Swims Through Burmese Curry   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Many people aren't familiar with Burmese food, but
their curiosity will be piqued once they try Philip Chu's Salmon
Curry. Of course, he takes some creative license, as all
California-based chefs do. He admits there is no salmon in Burma,
but the sauce is part of his heritage.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chu, who brought Burmese food to the Bay Area in 1983, has a
background in architecture, but his first love was cooking. He
opened a tiny restaurant in Oakland's Chinatown where he mixed in a
few Burmese dishes with the more familiar Chinese selections. As
the popularity of the restaurant grew, he moved to Rockridge in
1992 where he was able to expand the menu and to have more inviting
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Burmese curry is similar to what you might find in Thai
restaurants, but instead of being fiery hot, the dish relies on
careful balance of spicy, sweet and sour _ all of which comes from
tamarind powder, found in some specialty groceries and in Asian
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The flavors are vibrant, thanks to a blend of tomatoes, onions,
lemongrass, ginger and a bit of turmeric that adds a yellow hue.
The salmon steaks are cooked on top of this spicy blend, which
forms a sauce to flavor the fish.
</P>
<P>
   If you were going to eat this dish at the restaurant, I'd
recommend starting with the ginger salad made with 16 ingredients,
including peanuts, crunchy yellow lentils, shrimp powder, fried
garlic and cabbage. At home I'd start with an arugula salad with
toasted nuts. To accompany the salmon, consider spinach or other
leafy cooked vegetables and of course, steamed rice to soak up all
the wonderful juices.
</P>
<P>

EDITORS NOTE: Each week, wine editor Gerald Boyd discusses a
variety of wine topics.  WINE POTPOURRI: Let Your Mouse Do the Walking 
 &HT;       
 By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  How many times have you heard this friendly little
warning: ``If you're not on the Internet, you're still living in
the Stone Age''? I've lost count, but I'm happy to say that I am
not living in the Stone Age. Bronze Age, maybe, but I'm trying.
<P>
   I still don't know a Web site from a campsite, but I limp along,
pounding my computer and signing on to the Internet for my daily
overload of e-mail. Although I still place great stock in the U.S.
Postal Service, I'm now told by e-mail junkies that smail (that
oh-so-cute abbreviation for the sarcastic term, snail mail) is too
slow.
</P>
<P>
   In wine terms, the Internet revolution has morphed rapidly from
one application to another. I remember when everyone was talking
about wine chat on Prodigy. Now there are more wine chat rooms than
wine things to chat about.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time as the Prodigy-pondering, there was also a
rush by wineries to develop their own Web sites on the World Wide
Web. Does anyone really spend any time perusing these winery home
pages, or are they merely expensive security blankets for wineries
that don't want to be left behind in the Bronze Age?
</P>
<P>
   Now, a lot of money is being spent to get a piece of what is
known as wine e-commerce. Startup companies are hawking wine on the
Internet, selling wines at auction over the Net and working up a
sweat trying to convince wine drinkers that shopping for wine via
the Web is the way to go. It's a brave new world and if you listen
long enough to all the hype you begin to see the computer-deprived
wine lover skulking along in the shadows, searching hopelessly for
a bricks-and-mortar wine shop.
</P>
<P>
   Buying wine on the Internet may save a little time, but a
face-to-face interchange in a wine store can add to your wine
knowledge and give you the satisfaction that you've got what you
wanted without waiting days for a delivery. An over-simplification,
to be sure, but the point is that human contact keeps you in the
real world, while e-commerce removes the human element through the
wonders of electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Still, although I may be barely functioning in the Bronze Age,
I'm not stupid. The Internet and e-commerce are inevitable
juggernauts that are not to be denied. So with that in mind, here
is an incomplete list of companies selling wine, in one form or
another, on the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   _  &LR; www.wine.com &LR; . This Palo Alto-based wine portal is the
largest and best financed e-commerce wine sales company on the Web,
staffed by master sommeliers who select and taste the wines that
are recommended.  &LR; Wine.com &LR;  is headed by Peter Granoff, founder of
Virtual Vineyards and formerly with Square One restaurant in San
Francisco. Joining Granoff are Jeff Prather and a member of The
Chronicle's wine tasting panel, Peter Marks.
</P>
<P>
   _  &LR; www.wineshopper.com &LR; . This recent startup company is
affiliated with Wine &AMP; Spirits magazine and has offices in San
Francisco and Napa. It claims to be the first company to offer
nationwide fulfillment of the largest selection of wines available
anywhere.

EDITORS NOTE: Here's a plan for getting quick meals on the table in
a hurry. Now &AMP; Later is a recipe cooked on the weekend in batches _
enough to serve 12 _ and functions as dinner on the night it's
prepared; freeze the rest for two future meals. The 30-Minute
Recipe takes a half-hour or less of preparation and Fast and
Fresh.  THE WORKING COOK: Impress Your Guests With Buttery Seared Sea 
 Scallops  
   
 By Tara Duggan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Seared Scallops With Wonton Sheets and Lemon-Pine
Nut Butter is probably not something you would make after a long
work day _ even though the dish takes only a half hour to prepare.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's just that sea scallops don't fit into most people's daily
food budget. Still, buttery scallops layered between delicate
wonton sheets make a quick and impressive dish for a few guests.
</P>
<P>
   When you fix this dish, be sure to use the larger sea scallops,
not baby-size bay scallops, and just barely sear them or they will
lose the light texture that makes them such a delicacy. Because the
browned butter and pine nuts are rich, accompany the dish with
steamed broccoli and cauliflower florets if you'll be serving it as
an entree (it serves four). Otherwise, serve it on its own as a
first course to serve six.
</P>
<P>
   The Fast &AMP; Fresh recipe _ Quick Chickpea Curry With Watercress _
calls for only a few simple steps. Saute a little onion, stir in
some savory curry paste, then add cans of chickpeas, chopped tomato
and rich, sweet coconut milk. Bright green watercress adds a sharp,
fresh note at the end. The tender greens resemble arugula and are
usually found with other fresh herbs and lettuces. If you can't
find watercress, substitute baby spinach.
</P>
<P>
   Look for Indian _ not Thai _ style curry paste in the Asian
foods aisle of the supermarket. Westbrae Natural cq &LR; brand canned
organic garbanzo beans are firmer than most other canned varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Osso Buco With Porcini was adapted from Biba Caggiano's
recipe by Chronicle Food staff writer Lesli Neilson, who learned a
lot about this classic dish while living in Milan.
</P>
<P>
   Tender stewed veal in a sauce enriched with porcini mushrooms
and musky Marsala wine is a good match with polenta. Be sure to do
like the Milanese _ enjoy the bone marrow at the end.

   QUICK CHICKPEA CURRY WITH WATERCRESS
</P>
<P>
   Curry pastes can vary in strength; start with the smaller amount
and, if desired, add more after stirring in the coconut milk.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups basmati or long-grain white rice
</P>
<P>
   1 onion
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons butter
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 ounces prepared Indian-style curry paste
</P>
<P>
   2 cans (15 ounces each) chickpeas, drained and rinsed, or 3 cups
freshly cooked chickpeas
</P>
<P>
   1 (15-ounce) can chopped no-salt tomatoes, drained
</P>
<P>
   1 (15-ounce) can coconut milk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 bunch watercress
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Begin preparing the rice according to package directions and
allow it to cook while you prepare the curry.
</P>
<P>
   Dice the onion. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium
heat. Add the onion and curry paste. Cook until the onion is
tender, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the chickpeas, tomatoes and coconut milk. Stir and simmer
until the flavors are incorporated, about 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While the curry simmers, trim off 2 to 3 inches from the stems
of the watercress. Roughly chop the rest of the watercress. Add to
the curry, and cook until just wilted but still bright green, about
1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   Serve over rice.

thick, trimmed of silverskin
</P>
<P>
   2 cups flour
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 to 5 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   3 to 5 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   6 large carrots, cut in medium dice
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   3 cups dry Marsala
</P>
<P>
   3 cups meat broth
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely chopped Italian parsley
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Strain the porcini and reserve the water. Rinse the porcini well
and dice them. Using a fine strainer to remove any sandy deposits,
strain and reserve 3 cups of the soaking liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Pass the tomatoes through a food mill or strainer; discard
seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Dredge the veal shanks in the flour and shake off any excess.
Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the butter and oil in a large, heavy stockpot over medium
heat. When the butter foams, add the veal (work in batches; don't
crowd the pot) and saute until the shanks are golden-brown on both
sides, turning as needed, about 6 to 8 minutes total cooking time.
Add more butter and oil if needed. As the shanks brown, transfer
them to a plate.
</P>
<P>
   When all the shanks have browned, add the carrots, celery and
onions to the pot. Saute until lightly golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir
in the porcini. Return the veal to the pot, increase heat to high
and add the Marsala. Cook until the wine is almost completely
reduced, 6 to 8 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the broth, tomatoes and the reserved 3 cups porcini-soaking
water. Bring to a boil. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Reduce
heat to low, partially cover (leave the lid slightly askew), and
simmer gently until the meat begins to fall from the bones, about
11/2 to 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in the parsley. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and
pepper if needed.

</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons butter, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup pine nuts

PUTIN AND ALBRIGHT SQUARE OFF OVER RUSSIAN FOREIGN POLICY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a surprise appearance at a Middle East conference
here, the acting president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, sat down two
chairs away from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
delivered his first foreign policy statement, which within 15
minutes delineated the differences between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in his brisk, businesslike summary of fairly standard
points, Putin did not mention the war in Chechnya. Russia considers
the war an internal affair, but Washington continues to pressure
Moscow to negotiate a settlement to end it.
</P>
<P>
   He did pointedly single out the ``threat of the destruction of
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty,'' a reference to the Clinton
administration's desire to modify the major arms control treaty
between the United States and Russia. And he referred to Russia's
desire for an indivisible Europe, a rejoinder to Washington's
expansion of NATO to include former Soviet satellite countries.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Albright replied in kind.
</P>
<P>
   Without using the word Chechnya, she said the progress toward a
political solution in the Middle East should be used as an example
for how to resolve the war in the republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe our work here today is not only important for
promoting peace in the Middle East, but should also be a model for
all of us who seek to end difficult and painful conflicts,'' she
said. ``Conflicts within states, as well as those between states,
threaten our common security.''
</P>
<P>
   She reminded Putin that the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, of which the United States and Russia are
members, had recently assigned itself a role in resolving conflicts
within countries.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to Albright's rejoinder, Putin and the secretary
of state shook hands, and Putin left the conference hall as quickly
as he came.
</P>
<P>
   Albright and Putin will meet on Wednesday at the Kremlin in a
session that the Clinton administration hopes will give it its
first close-up assessment of the man who replaced Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   As Albright and her advisers prepared Tuesday for the Kremlin
meeting, reports from Chechnya said that the rebels had left the
capital, Grozny, presenting the secretary an opportunity to press
her argument that the war had to be resolved through negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One of Albright's senior aides said that the secretary would use
the ``politically obvious'' moment to argue again for a political
resolution in Chechnya. Whether Putin, who has vowed to crush the
separatist rebels, would heed the advice was another matter, the
aide said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been trying to forge a policy
that expresses distaste for the methods the Russian military is
using in Chechnya without so antagonizing Russia that relations are
totally soured.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said here that Moscow faced increasing isolation from
other nations if it continued to shun negotiations over Chechnya.
But there are also limits to the isolation that Washington wants to
impose on Moscow as the administration tries to negotiate a new
arms control agreement and engage Russia on other issues, including
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The Middle East conference here, which was co-directed by Russia
and the United States, was described by Albright as an example of
the common ground that Washington and Moscow could forge. The
gathering brought together the foreign ministers of most Middle
East countries _ including Israel, although not Syria or Lebanon _
to discuss practical issues like refugees, water and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was created at the Middle East Peace Conference
in Madrid in 1991 as a permanent mechanism for dealing with matters
that caused instability in the region. But the Steering Committee
of the conference, consisting of foreign ministers, had not met
since 1992, and lower-level officials had not met since 1996, when
the peace effort between Israel and the Palestinians slowed down.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the end of the gathering Tuesday afternoon, the foreign
ministers announced that permanent committees had been formed on
refugees, water, regional development and the environment, and that
they would report back to the ministers in July.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said that the discussion among
the foreign ministers had been ``practical rather than
theoretical.'' He said that many of the usual rhetorical flourishes
had been dropped.
</P>
<P>
   This was a sign, he said, that countries in the Middle East
believed that the negotiations now under way between the Israelis
and the Palestinians, and between the Israelis and the Syrians,
were more likely to produce results than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the official said, the conference and the
continuation of its work ``enhanced'' the environment for the talks
between the Israelis and the Palestinians and the Israelis and the
Syrians.

&HT;     BOXER URGES PERMANENT BAN ON INTERNET TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' categories.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND   
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Barbara Boxer on Tuesday urged a federal
advisory panel to permanently ban sales taxes on the Internet,
warning that such a tax would be ``a gamble with our nation's
prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the 19-member Advisory Commission on Electronic
Commerce, Boxer also argued that exempting Internet sales from
taxes wouldn't give Internet merchants an unfair advantage over
more traditional retailers because the e-commerce merchants have to
deal with shipping costs but store-based merchants don't.
</P>
<P>
   Taxing Internet sales ``would be a dangerous and unnecessary
gamble with our nation's prosperity,'' the California Democrat
said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was created to advise Congress on how to deal with the
issue of whether sales transactions conducted on the Internet
should be subject to sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Sales over the Internet, known as e-commerce, have exploded in
recent years, hitting about $20 billion during the 1999 Christmas
season. E-commerce is expected to triple every year for the next
four years, according to the National League of Cities.
</P>
<P>
   Because sales taxes are the lifeblood of state governments, many
state governments say they are losing tens of millions of dollars
in sales taxes as e-commerce mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   California's budget analyst Elizabeth Hill said earlier this
week that untaxed Internet sales may be costing the state as much
as $200 million a year in lost sales tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   In urging that e-commerce remain untaxed, Boxer argued that
technological innovation has created high-paying jobs and that
taxing e-commerce would jeopardize economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe we should risk having this growth stymied by
imposing sales taxes on Internet transactions,'' Boxer said.
</P>
<P>
   She said sales taxes are intended to pay for such services as
police, fire, sewer and water for retail merchants. But, she
argued, those public service costs don't apply to sales on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional retailers complain that they can't compete with
cyberspace merchants who aren't subject to sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But Boxer noted that Internet sales require that the e-commerce
merchant ship the product to the customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore,'' Boxer wrote, ``the argument made by
brick-and-mortar stores that Internet sellers have an unfair cost
advantage is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Her comments came a day before the Senate Budget Committee is
scheduled to hold a hearing on Internet taxation.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory commission was created by Congress last year to
make a recommendation on Internet tax policy. The panel's members,
who come from local, state and federal government and from the
e-commerce industry, are scheduled to present their recommendation
to Congress by April.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that a state can't force an
Internet seller or catalog to collect sales tax unless it has a
presence in that state, leaving it to Congress to make any changes.
In 1998, Congress imposed a moratorium on new Internet taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said Tuesday she is awaiting
the commission's findings before making a judgment on Internet
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not in a position to tell the commission what to do,''
Feinstein said. ``I have supported the moratorium and I believe we
should take no precipitous action.''

RELOCATE (Undated) - Marsha Monestersky is a 47-year-old New

 &QL; 
RELOCATE-COAL (Undated) - `Broken Rainbow'' won the 1986 Academy
Award as best feature documentary, claiming to find the reason for
the relocation of Navajos in a roaring blast of Peabody Coal Co.
dynamite that ripped a thick seam of reservation coal into bit-size
chunks for a monstrous strip-mining machine. Call it the coal
conspiracy theory. Those who accept it include many Navajos who are
caught up in relocation and thousands of non-Indian supporters
spread around the world. They insist, as one internet newsgroup
puts it, that the Navajos are being forced to leave their northern
Arizona homes `so that Peabody Western Coal Company can mine their
land.'' While there is no solid proof that coal interests pushed
for relocation, the stunningly rapid use of Navajo and Hopi lands
as a resource colony beginning in the 1960s buttress the conspiracy
theorists with a certain plausibility. And then there is the
involvement of the powerful Senate aide who pushed for relocation
and resigned after the bill was passed to become a vice president
of Peabody. By JERRY KAMMER. Story will move in the `A` category. &QL;

   They are not to be confused with another group my son likes,
whose music sounds like a spoon caught in the garbage disposal, or
a third group whose music sounds like a long-tailed cat in a
room-full of rocking chairs.
</P>
<P>
   That last line is one my father used to describe the music I
listened to as a teen-ager, and may even have been used by his
father to describe the music he listened to as a teen-ager, garbage
disposals not having been invented yet.
</P>
<P>
   My wife is not sure that the song lyrics of the group our son
wants to see are appropriate for the ears of a 13-year-old. I asked
her how she was so sure that the songs actually contained lyrics
since all I was able to make out was the sound of sharp, whirling
blades grinding away on a stainless-steel utensil.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, who keeps up with the entertainment news far better
than I, said that while she could not decipher any actual lyrics
either, she had read somewhere that the group used words that were
inappropriate for the ears of a 13-year-old, including (AT)!%,
!?(AT) and %&AMP;!!.
</P>
<P>
   I reminded her that some of the groups of our youth used words
like &AMP;(AT)% and !(AT) and, in the case of the Doors, even %&AMP;!!, and
we turned out pretty well, better, certainly, than Jim Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I said, what difference does it make what they're
saying if the only thing the ear perceives is the sound of a fork
clattering around in a garbage disposal?
</P>
<P>
   She said that teen-agers have much better hearing than adults
do, especially when it comes to words like (AT)!%, !?(AT) and %&AMP;!!,
and that language like that could stunt our son's emotional growth.
</P>
<P>
   I said if that is the case than she should not let me take him
golfing anymore because there are words bandied about on the course
that could reduce him to an emotional pygmy.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I said, if there's anyone whose emotional growth is in
danger of being stunted here, it's me. Has anyone given any thought
to the stunting I may incur being in the presence of 7,000
screaming, droopy-drawered, pierced-tongue, hormonally addled
teen-agers?
</P>
<P>
   You're the boy's father, my wife said. You're supposed to be a
role model.
</P>
<P>
   Role model? I said. If that means I'm supposed to stand out in a
crowd, then that will certainly be the case. I'll be like the lone
Republican at a convention of Yippies.
</P>
<P>
   You could wear that T-shirt I bought you last Christmas. That
will help you fit in.
</P>
<P>
   The one that says I Love Pugs? Somehow I don't think that's
going to resonate with this particular concert crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, my wife said, you need to be there to make sure he doesn't
get hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Hurt? Him? We're talking about a kid who can leap over a trash
can on his skateboard. I went out to pick up the paper in the
driveway this morning and I heard something pop in my back. If
anyone's in danger of getting hurt, it's me.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be OK, my wife said. Just stay out of the mosh pit.
</P>
<P>
   Mosh pit? I said. What's that?
</P>
<P>
   You'll find out, my wife snickered. By the way, honey, is your
insurance paid up?

LITTLE BELLS THAT MEAN A LOT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)   (Gerard R. Roche is chairman of Heidrick &AMP; Struggles International,
the executive search firm)  
 (bl)  
 By GERARD R. ROCHE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   My father had ulcers that were a complication from eating raw
pork when he was in the service during World War I. Before the war,
he had been a sales manager for H.J. Heinz. But after he became
ill, he couldn't go out and do the routes anymore. He had no
compensation, no disability.
</P>
<P>
   So my mother _ she was a registered nurse _ and he opened this
little grocery store right in our living room in Scranton, Pa. Dad
would come down and sit on a stool behind the counter, and sweat
would pour down him. I don't remember a day when he was well.
</P>
<P>
   A little bell would go off when the door to the store would
open. If we were having a meal we would rotate who would get up
from the dinner table. When a family member entered the store, the
bell would go off and you had to yell so everyone else would know
it wasn't a customer. We'd say, ``It's only me!'' When I get
big-headed about the executive search business and I'm talking to
the Lou Gerstners and Mike Armstrongs of the world, I always like
to remember that line: ``It's only me.''
</P>
<P>
   I started working in the store as soon as my nose reached the
counter. My income was the tips I got from delivering to Mrs. Davis
and Mrs. Griffiths, and I realized the faster I got there and the
better I treated them, the bigger the tip I got. That's the basic,
fundamental lesson of any business: Keep people happy, exceed their
expectations, and good things happen. That was in the middle of the
Depression, and our having food on the table depended on our
keeping our customers happy.
</P>
<P>
   After I'd been successful at Heidrick &AMP; Struggles, we moved to
Chappaqua in Westchester County, N.Y. But I insisted that my son
Paul get a job while in grade school. He got a paper route, and I
told him, ``Your ability to go to a movie on the weekend depends on
your ability to make people happy on your paper route.'' He ended
up going to Stanford and Wharton, and now he's a partner at
McKinsey. Of course, when he was little and it was storming or he
was ill, there were times that I'd deliver papers in my Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   My sister was three years older than I was. She was good and
smart and worked like heck. We're Irish, but she had chutzpah. But
my parents made the Old World decision that the boy was the one who
should get the education.
</P>
<P>
   After three years in the Navy and then getting my M.B.A. at
night while working at Mobil, I was recruited by Heidrick &AMP;
Struggles for a job with Philip Morris that would double my pay. It
was 1963, and I was a Jack Kennedy fan, mesmerized by the
tousled-hair guy who said, ``We can do better.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kennedy was shot, I was moribund. When the recruiter asked
if I wanted the job, I said: ``No, I don't. I'm confused.'' He
said, ``If you're confused, you'd be perfect for us.'' So I came
in, and 35 years later I'm still looking for a job to come across
my desk that I like better than this one. I haven't found it yet.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AYUTTHAYA, Thailand _ The best stone carvers here are the
artistic descendants of the craftsmen who built the great temples
of Asia, shaping images of Buddha and Shiva with age-old skill and
passion.
</P>
<P>
   But they are criminals.
</P>
<P>
   With chisels modeled on ancient tools, they chip and hone as
their fathers and grandfathers taught them, but now they mostly
work in the service of syndicates that steal, repair, make fakes of
and smuggle the historical treasures of Thailand, Cambodia and
Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Their trade has been an open secret for years. Now, for the
moment at least, the Thai government is cracking down.
</P>
<P>
   Sunthorn Sowapee, 62, one of the finest craftsmen here in the
ancient capital of Siam, 50 miles north of Bangkok, was arrested
last year and is awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   In a raid on his small wooden house at the edge of a rice field,
the authorities found 399 stolen artifacts _ Buddha heads, Khmer
statues, bits of carved lintels and porticos, some lying openly in
his courtyard, some submerged in the three ponds that surround it.
</P>
<P>
   It was a major operation for investigators just to winch the
heavy stones from the ponds, some of them covered in black engine
oil to mask their genuineness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very fine craftsmanship,'' said Metha Wichakana, who
heads the Ayutthaya office of the Department of Fine Arts and who
took part in the raid. ``He is one of the best stone carvers in
Thailand. Maybe there are three or four people who can do work like
Sunthorn.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunthorn now hangs his head in contrition. ``We did not know it
was illegal,'' he told a local reporter after his arrest. ``Now we
know.''
</P>
<P>
   His house now stands empty, ripe papayas hanging unpicked in the
trees and small dogs with huge ears sniffing around chunks of
partly carved limestone. A neighbor says he misses the constant
ring of chisel on stone: ``It was a calming sound. It made it easy
to fall asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his own handiwork, some of the stones dredged
from Sunthorn's ponds were important long-missing artifacts, like a
seventh-century lintel stolen from a temple on the Thai-Cambodian
border 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The raid on Sunthorn's house was part of a broader antismuggling
campaign that gained momentum last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of sweeps, the authorities confiscated hundreds of
fakes or illegally trafficked antiquities from shops in Bangkok,
mostly in the River City shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   In another step, the government returned more than 100 carved
stone blocks that had been smuggled into the country in early 1999
after being hacked from the walls of the great temple of Banteay
Chhmar in northwestern Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   Because of increased surveillance, experts say, an alternate
smuggling route from Cambodia through Singapore has emerged, but
that route too has come under pressure. Thai customs agents last
year intercepted a shipment from Singapore of 43 Cambodian stone
statues weighing more than eight tons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that antique smuggling is becoming a more
and more well-organized operation,'' said Wanchai Pussadej, a
deputy director general at the Customs Department.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a complex operation, from its logistics to its layers
of corruption to its artistic subtleties. It is here that masters
like Sunthorn are essential.
</P>
<P>
   To make them lighter and easier to transport, artifacts are
often cut into pieces or sliced from the faces of stone lintels,
then reassembled by skilled craftsmen using ground stone and epoxy
cement, Metha said.
</P>
<P>
   Statues are more valuable if they are in good repair, so artists
like Sunthorn often remodel figures that have been broken over the
centuries or while they are being smuggled.
</P>
<P>
   ``A head with eroded features can be repaired,'' Metha said.
``The features can be reconstructed just like plastic surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, antiquity is prized, so any new carvings the
masters produce are treated in a variety of ways to make them look
old.
</P>
<P>
   Metha said methods included chemical treatment, long immersion
underground or in ponds filled with lichen, or simply chipping and
rubbing traces of damage into newly made fakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the eyes of an archaeologist it is not too difficult to
see which are genuine and which are real,'' he said. ``If you live
with ancient monuments you look at them every day, every night, and
when you see one that is new you can tell the difference. But for
other people it can be quite difficult, because the stone carving
in Ayutthaya is very skillful.''
</P>
<P>
   Though many of the artifacts that pass through Ayutthaya come
from far away, the ancient city itself is a continuing source for
illegal dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Some artifacts are stolen by local people who sell them at low
prices to middlemen. Others are stolen by special order or bought
illegally from temples by collectors and smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   There are 700 to 1,000 temples in Ayutthaya alone, Metha said,
some still used as religious venues, others still unexcavated. The
city is too rich with the nation's heritage to police properly.
</P>
<P>
   So the population has been enlisted as volunteer guards, he said
_ monks in their temples, people in the trades in their shops or
service stations _ to keep a protective eye on the ancient gods
they live among.

BLUES-ROCKER SUSAN TEDESCHI GOES FOR GRAMMY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
 
 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And the nominees for the best new artist Grammys are:
</P>
<P>
   Bubblegum babe, Latina division, Christina Aguilera. Yep, heard
of her. A lot.
</P>
<P>
   Bubblegum babe No. 2, Britney Spears. Couldn't help hearing
about her.
</P>
<P>
   Misogynist rap-rocker Kid Rock. Kind of wish we hadn't heard of
him.
</P>
<P>
   Divinely slinky soulster Macy Gray. Simply loved hearing her
this year, even if it didn't happen nearly often enough.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, gutbucket blues-rocker Susan Tedeschi.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, who?
</P>
<P>
   She may not have had the music videos or magazine covers or New
Yorker profiles or screaming adolescent fans of Spears, Aguilera
and Rock.
</P>
<P>
   And Tedeschi's music, a rootsy mix of traditional electric blues
and straight-ahead old-school rock, isn't the sort that sends
spasms through the Mickey Mouse Club-Nickelodeon crowd, techno
ravers, lounge and swing fans, rappers or much else.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly two years after the initial independent release of
her first album, ``Just Won't Burn,'' followed by an insanely heavy
touring schedule that has kept on her on the road _ and without a
permanent home _ ever since, the 27-year-old Tedeschi is finally
reaping some benefits from all her work.
</P>
<P>
   One was a recent appearance on ``The Late Late Show,'' on CBS
with Craig Kilborn. During the taping at CBS' Fairfax District
studios, she belted out one of her best-known songs, ``It Hurt So
Bad,'' written and produced by her drummer, Tom Hambridge.
</P>
<P>
   The small studio audience went wild over the song, delivered in
Tedeschi's Joplin-esque howl, a big growly voice wildly out of
synch with her skinny body and elfin blond looks. Afterward, she
marveled over the nomination, which had been announced just a few
days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor that's acutally pretty amazing,'' Tedeschi said.
``I haven't sold as many records as any of those others. I haven't
done a video. But it worked out. It was exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say she doesn't have a lot of admirers, some in
high places. In the past couple of years, she's played with the
Allman Brothers (where she met her current boyfriend, guitarist
Derek Trucks), Bob Dylan, Buddy Guy and B.B. King; appeared at
Lilith Fair (where she joined Sheryl Crow); recorded ``Crazy'' with
Willie Nelson for his upcoming album of duets; and been on David
Letterman and Jay Leno's late-night TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   Her beloved guitar, bedecked with stickers, is shown in the
photo on the back of her CD and these days has a lot more
autographs from her heroes written on its body. The John Hancocks
include those of Clarence ``Gatemouth'' Brown, John Hiatt, Dr. John
and the Fabulous Thunderbirds' Jimmy Vaughan.
</P>
<P>
   She has equally rich musical influences, including great Delta
and Chicago blues artists like Big Mama Thornton, Little Walter
Jacobs, Willie Dixon, Bobby Bland and Koko Taylor; and pop, soul
and gospel stars like Aretha Franklin, Linda Ronstadt, Mahalia
Jackson and Etta James.
</P>
<P>
   And though she'll never be heard on Radio Disney, she has gotten
good airplay for several of her songs on adult album alternative
and rock radio stations. Not bad for a no-name from Norwell, Mass.,
with an independent release on little-known Tone Cool Records.
</P>
<P>
   And she's about to go back into the studio to record a new
album, as soon as she figures out !ital!which studio she wants to
record in. With her label pushing for a poppier sound, Tedeschi is
trying to hew to her roots with a grittier sound. And she'll be
back on the road touring soon as well, except for Grammy night,
when she plans to be at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Tedeschi to handicap her chances of winning Grammy night,
however, and she can give you both pluses and minuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do their dance moves, I don't do the dance moves,''
Tedeschi said. ``But I've got Mickey Mouse stickers on my guitar,
so maybe I've got a chance after all.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Deal would make Alltel fourth-largest wireless firm
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alltel Corp. on Tuesday announced a deal to swap wireless
properties in 13 states with Bell Atlantic and GTE, a move that
will make Alltel the nation's fourth-largest wireless provider _
putting it ahead of BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   For the aggressive Little Rock-based Alltel, the agreement will
mean more geographic unity as it jettisons licenses in places like
Pennsylvania, Indiana and Nevada. But Alltel also emerges from the
deal with 770,000 new customers.
</P>
<P>
   For Bell Atlantic, which plans a joint venture with Vodafone
AirTouch, the deal will eliminate overlap among 24 million
subscribers. Alltel emerges with 5.8 million subscribers, behind
AT&AMP;T and SBC, but in front of BellSouth, which has 5.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   No Georgia assets will change hands in the deal, which includes
$600 million in payments from Alltel to its partners. But Alltel
customers will soon be able to use wireless at a discount when they
travel to cities served by Bell Atlantic and Vodafone. That
arrangement will enable the company to compete with ``one-rate''
plans from the likes of AT&AMP;T and Sprint, said analyst Charles
Pluckhahn of Stephens Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lets them transition from a Balkanized, locally-biased
patch quilt of systems toward the national footprint that is the
paradigm of the future. I think this is a very, very smart deal for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Alltel last year had revenues of $6.3 billion, and while often
considered a likely takeover target, is more likely to be hunter
than prey, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, Alltel is the second-largest local phone company,
boasting 615,500 local phone customers, mostly in rural areas,
compared to BellSouth, which has more than 4 million. Alltel also
has 233,100 wireless customers in Georgia, 191,150 customers who
buy long-distance and 36,200 customers who buy Internet access.
Many of the 1 milion Alltel customers in Georgia fall into more
than one category, since the company's most potent marketing ploy
is the ``bundling'' of services.
</P>
<P>
   Alltel will follow the agreement by offering local service in
new places, then packaging as many services as possible, said Joe
Ford, company chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Alltel has 3,200 employees in Georgia, including 1,200 at its
state headquarters in Alpharetta.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth spokesman Jeff Battcher rejected the notion that
BellSouth's strategy suffers in contrast to that of Alltel or Bell
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's wireless offerings are nearly all in the nine
Southeast states where it remains the dominant provider. The
company also packages wireless with other services, although it is
still waiting for federal approval to offer long-distance.
BellSouth does have several one-rate plans in which customers are
not charged more for ``roaming'' outside the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy continues to be the same, that wireless is a big
part of bundled service,'' Battcher said. ``Our rates are very
competitive, and we are constantly re-negotiating those roaming
agreements. This agreement means nothing to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, AirTouch currently offers wireless service and
is generally believed to be second in market share to BellSouth.
Alltel has a license to provide wireless, but has yet to build a
system here. Company spokeswoman Sarah Clark said the company plans
to retain the license, but has ``no exact plans'' for launching
service.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement gave a boost to Alltel stock, which climbed
$4.25 a share to close at $71.

 &HT;    Amazon.com to add home furnishings
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amazon.com said it will add yet another product category to its
growing list of offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the company announced an agreement with Web-commerce
site Living.com to create a Home Living store on Amazon's already
well-populated Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon will receive $145 million from Living.com over a period
of five years in exchange for being Amazon's exclusive home
fashions and furnishings store. Amazon.com will make an investment
in Living.com to acquire an 18 percent stake in the company, with
warrants for another 9 percent, upon the transaction's closing,
which is expected later this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came a few days after the company said it would
lay off 150 Seattle-based employees and two days before it will
report fourth quarter earnings to a skeptical Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said last week the layoffs were a message to Wall
Street that Amazon would pay closer attention to its profitability,
which it had forgone in favor of increasing product lines.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Living.com is a bit different from others in that
Amazon isn't going into the home furnishings business, but will get
revenue and equity from the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Living store plans to sell furniture, bedding, home
textiles, decorative accessories, window treatments and other
home-related products. The Home Living store will be displayed
prominently along with Amazon's other offerings, including books,
music, video, consumer electronics and home improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The new mantra at Amazon is to make the the company ``a place
where you can find and discover anything and everything you might
be looking to buy online.'' That sentiment was repeated in a
statement from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shaun Holliday, chief executive officer of Living.com, said,
``This agreement gives us access to Amazon.com's 16 million
customers who are already sold on buying online, it associates
Living.com with the leading brand in online shopping, and it gives
us a way to reach customers and build relationships that others
will not be able to duplicate.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com will have a seat on the Living.com board of
directors. Both of the agreements relating to the Home Living store
and the Amazon.com investment are subject to certain closing
conditions, including Hart-Scott-Rodino review.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that, even though the details of the deal are
sketchy, it's a sign that Amazon is still focused on expansion, but
no longer at the expense of profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exclusive deal means Amazon understands it would be more
profitable to receive advertising revenue and have an equity stake
than to actually go into that business for themselves.''
(Living.com will be the exclusive merchant in the Home Living area,
basically capitalizing on Amazon's reputation, traffic and brand
name to offer its products.)
</P>
<P>
   ``They are beginning to learn how expensive it is to go into
other lines of business,'' Cassar says. ``It may be logistically
better to allow others to run those businesses, but capitalize on
the ad revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   He also says the home market has just begun to emerge online.
Jupiter Communications predicts revenues will hit $300 million in
2000 and may reach as much as $600 million by 20003. ``It certainly
is a sizeable market but there are a lot of people competing in
that space, like Pottery Barn, Williams Sonoma and others.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Amazon has always had tight control over its
distribution process, something that will change. ``It's
interesting they haven't decided to sell those products themselves.
It sounds like Amazon is going to be comfortable with an arm's
length in terms of distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   The Living.com deal and others with the merchants in Z Shops,
Amazon's auction area, Drugstore.com and Pets.com are all cases
where Amazon leaves the merchandizing and distribution to someone
else. ``As Amazon moves away from completely controlling the
customer experience and relying on partners to execute orders there
is risk that damage could be done to their brand.,'' Cassar says.
`` But it's becoming increasingly apparent to me that Amazon is
realizing they cannot lose money forever. ``

 &HT;    HipO.com gets reworked
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tim Cobb, co-founder of RelevantKnowledge, one of Atlanta's more
well-known technology companies, has reworked the business model on
his follow-up venture, HipO.com.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Cobb and Jeff Levy sold RelevantKnowledge, a Web
measurement firm, to MediaMetrix in November, 1998, Cobb started
HipO.com. His idea was to tap teenage spending money, estimated to
be hundreds of billions of dollars. The main source of revenue
would be selling clothes from the HipO.com Web site. The company
would issue ``Hip Cards,'' a kind of online debit cards that would
overcome the fact that most teens don't have the credit cards most
retailers require for buying things online.
</P>
<P>
   But selling clothes to kids online was not so simple Cobb said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the teen clothes market is that the
manufacturers doing more than $100 million in revenue were not
interested in selling online to anyone,'' Cobb said. ``My guess is
that someone out there will make a teen card work. The challenge I
saw was that adoption would be slow.''
</P>
<P>
   So Cobb, 35, shifted the business model and will instead focus
on providing a marketplace for clothes makers and retailers to do
business.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-employee company, based in offices at Perimeter Center on
Concourse Parkway, will have a new name and new logo to fit the new
model, Cobb said. He said he also plans to seek about $5 million in
outside investment by the end of March. HipO.com was funded in part
by $7 million from start-up investors, including Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb said the biggest strike against selling online to teens was
that the stocks of similar companies have not performed that well.
ITurf went public last April at $22 a share. It was trading Monday
at a little under $14. Alloy Online went public in May at $15 a
share and traded at $16 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb's new idea creates the next generation of catalog for
retail buyers. The new company will help clothes-makers display
their products on a Web site. The buyers will be able to track
their order and confirm arrival, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to offer ``dynamic pricing.'' Clothes-makers tend
to sell items in units of a dozen or so. Some smaller retailers
don't have the sales to justify buying enough in each size and
style. A dynamic pricing model would let small retailers group
their purchases to meet the minimum-order needs of the
manufacturers, Cobb said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is similar to what companies such as Ariba, Clarus and
FreeMarkets are doing, but it is focused on a market that Cobb
believes is untapped.

 &HT;    Tech types learn to manage
 &HT;    By Maria Mallory
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to information technology, good managers are not
necessarily born that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's often a gap between where the companies want them to
be as managers and where they are,'' says Peter M. Vantine,
associate dean and director of executive programs at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   To bridge that gap, many companies are training their top IT
professionals today to take over as tomorrow's leading IT managers.
</P>
<P>
   One such training program, the Information Technology Management
Partnership at Georgia Tech, is a joint venture of the university's
DuPree College of Management and 25 firms, including Bass Hotels
and Resorts, Southern Co., BellSouth, Coca-Cola Co. and Equifax.
</P>
<P>
   Through a collaborative effort, the partnership participants
have designed a management development program with the goal of
broadening their workers' IT perspective from their specific
technical job function to the more sweeping role of information
technology as a tool of and contributor to modern enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information Technology managers usually come up through the
ranks and they know technology very well,'' explains Janis Beavin,
of the information resources training team at Southern Company
Services Inc., which has sent 17 workers through the program since
it began three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their training has not been in terms of making financial
decisions or understanding the strategies of the business and tying
what they do to the strategies. We need to be able to say, 'Here's
what we can do with technology to run the business better.' ``
</P>
<P>
   That's a move that takes a shift in perspective and exposure,
Georgia Tech's Vantine says, and the partnership has been designed
to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   First, the program focuses on strategic planning, sales and
marketing, finance and accounting, and how these functions work
together to build competitive business performance. Second, the
program teaches how to justify IT investments, to measure IT
performance and to focus on IT processes. Finally, participants are
taught how to lead and manage IT professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real focused look at just information technology
issues,'' says Beavin.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership not only concentrates on IT-specific issues, it
also streamlines the education process in terms of time and
tuition, says Beavin. The traditional master's of technology degree
takes two years to complete and generally offers a much broader
approach to the industry.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Georgia Tech's partnership program is completed
during 60 hours of class time, conducted twice a year _ once in the
spring, once in the fall _ during 11 consecutive Monday sessions or
during two one-week modules spaced one month apart. Tuition is
$4,200 per student, which is paid by the sponsoring employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call it the mini MOT (master's of technology),'' says
Beavin. ``We have a lot of people who have gotten master's degrees
on their own who still go to this because your master's degree gets
stale fast.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their commitment to providing students and paying
their tuition, partnership companies help fine-tune the program
curriculum and send representatives to a board of directors that
meets at the end each program session to evaluate its
effectiveness. And while Georgia Tech faculty are largely
responsible for teaching, partnership executives often serve as
guest lecturers.
</P>
<P>
   Cutline: Georgia Tech's DuPree College of Management attracts
workers and managers from many area corporations to its Executive
Education programs. Students enroll in programs focusing on
Mid-Management, Finance and Accounting, Technology Management, and
Information Technology Management.

 &HT;    Firm track advertising effectiveness
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What would it be worth to a business owner to be able to track
every customer who enters your store or mall? How valuable would it
be to know where your customers go, which stores they enter, which
ones they don't, and why they came in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   It cannot easily be done in the real world without violating
stalking laws. But the Internet is a different story.
</P>
<P>
   One Atlanta company is among the handful of firms developing
software that lets companies measure the effectiveness of
advertising campaigns and the appeal and popularity of their Web
sites. The firm also has a product that lets companies monitor
employee Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies are buying multimillion dollar television ads
to draw visitors to their Web sites. Great for the networks. But
eventually companies will want to measure the effectiveness of
those ads. Getting people to come to your Web site is only half the
battle. Finding out what people do when they visit helps define
business strategy for the other half.
</P>
<P>
   Telemate.Net Software, based in offices just inside the
Perimeter off North Peachtree Road, plans to introduce a product
this month that will let companies with a Web site find out who
visits their sites, where they go and why they came. Companies such
as WebTrends and Accrue Software provide statistical data about
visitors to a Web site and what percentage of those actually make
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Telemate.Net's product offers more detail than its competitors,
and it will be integrated with the Internet and phone use products,
said Chandan Sarkar, an analyst with SoundView Technology Group.
SoundView led Telemate.Net's September initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mauro, Telemate.Net chief's executive, calls the product
the next generation of customer intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deal with customers in more electronic form,'' he said.
``This product helps determine the profitability and efficiency of
your marketing programs and sales approaches. We can provide a
complete tracking of an individual when they come to a site. We
have a marketing partnership with Microsoft, for example. This lets
us tell how many people come to our site from theirs and how many
of those people download our software.''
</P>
<P>
   Telemate.Net shares closed Tuesday at $13.25, 75 cents below its
IPO price. The firm is expected to announce quarterly earnings
Thursday. Telemate.Net lost $1.7 million on reported revenue of
$3.5 million for the three months that ended Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Telemate.net Software made its name selling software that lets
companies keep tabs on employee phone use. The software pulls
information from the phone system and lets companies see what calls
are made and who made them. Law firms also use the software to
measure phone time for client billing purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But like other forward-thinking firms, Telemate saw the future
and shifted its business model to grab a piece of it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Telemate founder David Couchman hired Mauro, the former
vice president of marketing for the Inforum, to take the company in
a different direction.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro decided to apply what Telemate does _ pull information
stored in complex hardware and deliver it in usable form _ to
another growing workplace tool, the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw the Internet coming,'' Mauro said. ``If all the
potential there comes true, then the same issues driving people to
buy call accounting software would exist on the Internet, maybe to
a greater extent.''
</P>
<P>
   Telemate started taking its profit and investing in research to
develop the new Internet usage product. The firm spent about $7
million and released its first Internet usage measurement product
in 1997. The next year, it released a version that integrated the
phone and Internet products. The company now employs 207 people,
mostly in Atlanta. It also has offices in Washington, D.C., to
service government contracts, as well as London.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data we wanted was sitting in firewalls,'' Mauro said.
``They were logging every transaction on the Internet, but it was
just sitting there. It wasn't accessible. We pulled it out and did
exactly as we do for call accounting. We provided information on
how people use the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said the integrated product should be the largest source
of revenue for Telemate.Net by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   The market for Internet usage is less than 2 years old and
growing, said SoundView's Sarkar. A recent study by Netpulse showed
that 2 percent of employees use work computers to download
pornography during breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Telemate.Net's customers include AT&AMP;T, Philip Morris,
PricewaterhouseCoopers, Sears, Roebuck and BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has been using Telemate.Net's network traffic
monitoring product for about a year, said Robert Rothberg, a
network traffic analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Rothberg said BellSouth blocks Web sites that are inappropriate
for the workplace. He said most sites visited are related to
technology and local news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our surfing policy is that you can do some personal surfing,
but not a whole lot. But there's not a whole lot of personal
surfing, partly because employees respect the policy and partly
because a lot of people know we have this Telemate.net product, and
we could monitor if we need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothberg's group looks at how much of BellSouth's Internet pipe
is being used and how fast it's being used. They study the trends
and try to plan for the company's bandwidth needs down the road and
whether what they have can be used more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth also runs daily reports that show which Internet sites
are visited most often and what time of the day traffic peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Rothberg said he likes the Telemate product because of its level
of detail and the speed. Some networkwide reports can take 24 hours
to generate. BellSouth's takes 16 hours to run 40 reports. The
results are posted daily on the company's Intranet and e-mailed to
managers who want them.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Netpulse showed that 2 percent of employees
use work computers to download pornography during breaks.Liftout

WHEN STOPPARD SENDS HIS `LOVE,' SAN FRANCISCO RECIPROCATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Even Tom Stoppard admits that his drama ``The
Invention of Love'' is a bit difficult. The play, about the British
poet and classicist A.E. Housman, has a dreamlike quality. It lasts
three hours, the characters sometimes speak Latin, and there are
allusions to Greek myth. Broadway producers have not been
enthusiastic about staging the sprawling drama.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the U.S. premiere of the play at the 1,000-seat Geary
Theater here, presented by the American Conservatory Theater, is
nearly sold out every night. Its success is a testimony not only to
Stoppard's artfulness but also to the bond between this city _ for
that matter, this region _ and the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look upon the theater here not just as entertainment
but as a form of enlightenment, and what city is like that?'' said
Carey Perloff, the artistic director of American Conservatory
Theater, which is San Francisco's largest repertory company.
Perloff, who also directed the Stoppard play, said that working
here was ``totally the opposite of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember directing Beckett's `Happy Days' at the Mark Taper
Forum in Los Angeles in 1990,'' she said. ``I remember saying: `We
really have to have good program notes or something because they're
going to think it's `Happy Days' the TV series. If you walk in
expecting the Fonz, you're going to find it really hard to
understand Beckett.'''
</P>
<P>
   Across the bay, Susan Medak, managing director of the 400-seat
Berkeley Repertory Theater, which is now building a second theater
in Berkeley to open next year, echoed Perloff. (American
Conservatory often focuses on classics and large-scale works, while
the Berkeley Rep is more avant-garde.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a great theater area,'' said Medak. ``Whatever
people do for a living, they like to think of themselves as open to
a wide range of ideas. And that's the fertilizer for good
theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The play explores the memories of Housman (played by James
Cromwell), who lived his entire life secretly in love with his
Oxford classmate Moses Jackson, the school track star. Reviewers in
San Francisco, while saying the play was a difficult one, were
generally positive. Ben Brantley, in The New York Times, wrote that
the play, which had been a hit in London, ranked as one of
Stoppard's finest, but that ``the musty air of the schoolroom''
hovered over it.
</P>
<P>
   Stoppard _ unpretentious, friendly and arguably Britain's most
acclaimed and prolific playwright _ acknowledged that the play was
not an easy one. He said his friends Andre Bishop and Bernard
Gerstein, artistic director and executive producer, respectively,
of Lincoln Center Theater in New York, saw the 23-character work in
London (some actors play multiple roles) but shied away from
staging it in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie was up front about it,'' said Stoppard. ``He said, `I'm
not sure how to do this play in New York because I'm not sure
whether it would fit our audience.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a play, by the way; it's a big play with a big
role and a lot of characters,'' added Stoppard, sitting in his
hotel room only yards from the Geary Theater. ``A sensible
playright would write a play with three or four people. Three is
best. A man and his dog is even better.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with New York and even London, San Francisco is
Stoppard's most welcoming city. A Stoppard play is a San Francisco
event. He is almost a celebrity here (as is the American playwright
August Wilson). A recent lecture by Stoppard drew 1,300 people, and
American Conservatory Theater has trotted him out to raise money,
including a dinner with three well-heeled couples who contributed a
total of $100,000 to the company to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one way or another, I'm a local talent,'' said Stoppard,
who won an Academy Award last year with Marc Norman for the
screenplay ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   One of Stoppard's recent plays, ``India Ink,'' a wistful romance
about an English poet and an Indian artist, also had its American
stage premiere here last year. And virtually all of his well-known
plays _ including ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,''
``Jumpers,'' ``Arcadia'' and ``Travesties'' _ have also been
performed by the American Conservatory Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theater here has developed audiences which want to see
plays like this,'' he said. ``In places like New York, broadly
speaking, the relationship between money and the art form is quite
impersonal. The thing about a place like San Francisco _ and it's
also true of Philadelphia _ is there's a more personal relationship
between the enlightened patron and the artist. People are on
first-name terms with each other. There's a lot of local pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Perloff said her theater company benefited enormously from a
hotel tax in San Francisco that supported the arts, as well as from
substantial contributions from the foundations of large
corporations in the region, like Visa, United Airlines and Pacific
Gas and Electric.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have to fund-raise anywhere, this is the place,'' she
said. ``And believe me, I did it for eight years in New York.''
(Still, the new multimillionaires in nearby Silicon Valley have not
opened their wallets to the San Francisco area theaters, she said.)
</P>
<P>
   Perloff, who had been artistic director of the Classic Stage
Company in Manhattan, took over a near-moribund American
Conservatory Theater in 1992. The company had been devastated by an
earthquake, and its prestigious school, whose students have
included Denzel Washington, Annette Bening and Winona Ryder, was on
the verge of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   She helped raise $28 million to rebuild the theater, and the
company undertook some risky and highly publicized productions.
These included a sexually explicit ``Duchess of Malfi,'' which
stirred the ire of some religious groups, as well as provocative
versions of works by Shakespeare, Chekhov and Tennessee Williams.
About $3 million of the company's $13 million budget comes from
contributions. The rest is raised mostly from theater subscriptions
and box office receipts.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the biggest competition is not other theaters,
although the nearby regional troupes include the San Jose Repertory
Company, Theaterworks in Palo Alto, the Marin Theater Company and
the California Shakespeare Company in Orinda, east of Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest competition in this town is food,'' Perloff said.
``Theater has to be better than a good meal. People take their food
very, very seriously here.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoppard, whose works can compete successfully with the most
elaborate dinner, said he was still revising his play during its
run here, which ends in mid-February. ``I don't think of the play
as being an inflexible sacred text,'' he said. ``I've never felt
that way about my plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoppard, author of so many erudite plays, left school at 17 to
work as a journalist and was never formally trained at a
university. He said he began researching Housman, ``the greatest
Latin scholar of his time,'' in 1993, shortly after completing
``Arcadia.'' Housman is best known for his poem ``A Shropshire
Lad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I responded instantly to this figure who was such a strange
mixture. His poetry was romantic, but he was not romantic at all,''
said Stoppard, 62. ``It sounds very naive, but I didn't know he was
gay until after I knew I wanted to write a play about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoppard has, of course, received numerous screenplay offers,
especially since ``Shakespeare in Love.'' He has already adapted
the Robert Harris novel ``Enigma,'' about British code breakers
during World War II. And his next play, an expansive one that is
still untitled, is about 19th-century socialism and the Soviet
Union. He said he hoped to complete it by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Typically the work is unconventional. ``It's a six-hour play,''
he said. ``In defense, I'm thinking of it as three plays. I'm
telling everyone it's a trilogy.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I don't read Russian. I don't know how to write
about Russians. I don't know what I think I'm doing, but I'm doing
it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Perloff said she hoped to stage the American premiere
in San Francisco.

<P>
   Call it ``The Broccoli Problem.'' Every few months, dozens of
business executives travel to the Wharton School at the University
of Pennsylvania for an intensive week spent sharpening their
negotiation skills. That they are sent by their companies is a sign
of their authority. These folks are important. It is their job to
tell other people what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why it is so striking to G. Richard Shell, the
professor of legal studies and management who runs the seminar, to
hear what each of these commanding folks have to say when they
introduce themselves at the opening dinner. Asked to explain why
they have come, they often talk of frustrations that have nothing
to do with work: a daughter who won't clean her room, a son who
doesn't respect curfew, a toddler who refuses to eat her
vegetables. All this cracker-jack talent at the office. Why doesn't
it work for them at home?
</P>
<P>
   I noticed from the time I first started to work that my working
self had a different personality than my nights-and-weekends self.
It is not a change as dramatic as Jekyll and Hyde. It's more like
Mr. Rogers trading his jacket for his sneakers and cardigan or
maybe Superman throwing street clothes over his cape and tights,
because I seem to lose some of my power in the process. After
spending all day smoothly interviewing grown-ups, for instance, I
can spend all evening being stonewalled by my smallest source.
``Nothing,'' he answers, with all the force of a politician's ``No
comment,'' when I ask him what he did in kindergarten that day.
</P>
<P>
   I've come to see this personality shift as natural and
necessary. The alternative, to my mind, is Captain von Trapp in
``The Sound of Music,'' whistling for his children as he would
whistle for his sailors. So when Professor Shell poses his question
_ ``Why doesn't it work for them at home?'' _ I am ready with an
answer. Home and job are different. The skills that work in one are
useless in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong, says the professor. Skills from the office work just fine
at home, if only we would remember to use them.
</P>
<P>
   As the author of ``Bargaining for Advantage: Negotiation
Strategies for Reasonable People,'' he specifically means skills of
negotiation. Imagine, he says, that you are a manager who needs an
employee to work weekends. Would you yell at that employee? Would
you set the kitchen timer and let it tick until he agrees? Would
you send him to his cubicle or tell him he can't have dessert? Now
imagine you are trying to get a serving of broccoli into a child
who has locked his jaw. Wouldn't you do all of those things?
</P>
<P>
   Of course you would, Shell says, and you would do so because you
are human. It is tiring to keep going at home as you have in the
office, which is why the cobbler's children of folklore have no
shoes. ``I can't drill my daughter at night the way I drill my
students during the day,'' a reading teacher once told me, worrying
over the paradox that her daughter was behind the curve in her own
reading skills. ``I want to be her mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only are we too tired to bring our professional selves home,
Shell says, we are also too emotional. A good manager would be
thinking of compromise, trying to give the employee some modicum of
control, such as a choice of which weekend to work. That manager
would also have a Zen understanding of the fact that this is just a
scheduling conflict, not a reflection on his value as a human
being. But for a parent, each stalk of broccoli becomes all that
stands between the child and scurvy and each uneaten bite is proof
positive that this child will grow up to be an undisciplined brat.
</P>
<P>
   I am about to argue with Shell, to point out that I don't know a
lot of Zen-like managers (most simply offer extra pay for a weekend
of work, which isn't exactly the right message for a toddler) and
that maybe an excess of emotion at home is what makes it a home. Do
we really want razor-sharp vision or analytical acuity when gazing
at our families, or do we want things to be blurred by a little
love?
</P>
<P>
   In other words, I am about to redefine imperfection and weakness
as a deliberate life's choice. But then the professor mentions that
he has successfully negotiated the broccoli problem with his own
young son, and I am distracted by the details.
</P>
<P>
   The secret, it seems, is a package of McDonald's sweet and sour
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Try pouring  &UR; that  &LR; over an unpalatable weekend shift.

 &HT;    HOMELESS-ONLY SCHOOLS HARMFUL, REPORT SAYS
 &HT;    500&AMP;add
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Homeless children are harmed by a growing trend of
assigning them to special classes or schools for homeless children,
the National Law Center for Homelessness and Poverty reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Requiring or encouraging homeless children to attend separate
schools ``isolates them from their non-homeless peers and deprives
them of the opportunity for normal intellectual and social
growth,'' said attorney Sarah McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote the Washington-based advocacy group's report,
``Separate and Unequal,'' which was endorsed by eight national
associations concerned with homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the separate schools vigorously disputed the
charge that the children are harmed. They also rejected the
center's charge that the schools violate a federal law called the
McKinney Homeless Assistance Act.
</P>
<P>
   Before passage of the McKinney Act 13 years ago, more than 50
percent of homeless children were out of school. ``Now only 12
percent aren't in school,'' said Maria Foscarinis, the center's
executive director. She said the new trend could undercut that
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the House passed an education bill that contained an
amendment by Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., that would quietly amend
the McKinney Act to eliminate the threat of legal challenges to
separate schools for homeless children. The Senate is expected to
act on the bill by March.
</P>
<P>
   ``All children need to be in school, and no child should be
deprived of the right to attend the same public school as others
merely because he or she is homeless,'' said Foscarinis.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 facilities in 19 states educate homeless children
in specialized schools for the homeless, according to the center's
report.
</P>
<P>
   Some are bare-bones programs, in which a single uncertified
teacher instructs children of many ages and grades in a spare room
at a homeless shelter or community center.
</P>
<P>
   Some are private ventures. One women's shelter in Houston
educates the women's children in-house because of a lack of trust
in the ability of the public schools to protect the children from
their mother's abusive male partners.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, the public Thomas J. Pappas School, which
serves 750 elementary and junior high students in Phoenix, has been
praised as a model and visited by admiring dignitaries, including
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our school isn't separate and unequal, it's separate and
superior,'' said Sandra Dowling of Phoenix, the elected
superintendent of schools in Maricopa County, Arizona. She said
many of the county's 58 school districts encourage homeless
children to attend the Pappas school.
</P>
<P>
   The school offers an intense academic curriculum,
extracurricular activities and special services that range from
showers, clothing, food packages, a computer lab and volunteer
mentors to counseling on how to cope with family violence. Each
morning, teachers line up outside the school to meet each school
bus and give each child a hug.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these families move two or three times a month,
constantly moving across district lines, and (Pappas) provides
continuity in education until the family can stabilize,'' Dowling
said. ``We don't violate the McKinney Act. We believe it gives
children the right to attend the school that best meets their
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If one of our (homeless) kids think they can handle sitting at
a desk next to a kid who wears $250 Air Jordans, they can go to a
neighborhood school,'' she said. But she said children who aren't
homeless must be excluded from the Pappas school because they might
make fun of classmates who get free shoes or boxes of food to take
home.
</P>
<P>
   Between 500,000 and 700,000 school-age children have a spell of
homelessness in any given year, according to a report issued
separately Tuesday by the Urban Institute.
</P>
<P>
   States this year get $31.7 million in McKinney Act funds to
cover extra costs, such as transporting children to their old
school from a shelter in another neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the states must make sure that homeless children are
allowed to obtain a public education, preferably in the school they
attended before their family lost its housing.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, this involves reminding principals or school
secretaries that they risk being sued if they exclude homeless
children on the grounds of non-residency or inability to produce a
birth certificate, immunization record or transcript of grades.
</P>
<P>
   The association of state coordinators in charge of issuing such
reminders is among the groups endorsing the center's report.

TV NOTES: ABC LEADS IN RATINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC Is in Shape For the Sweeps
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl always gives an enormous bounce to whichever
network is broadcasting it; this season, combined with the buoyancy
provided by three doses of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' every
week, the Super Bowl has lifted ABC into the Nielsen ratings
firmament.
</P>
<P>
   That means ABC is first everywhere you look: among total
viewers; among viewers from ages 18 to 49 and 25 to 54; among those
18 to 34 (tied with Fox); among teen-agers; among children.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, ABC is putting the network ratings spinmeisters
out of business this season. There is no argument about which
network leads in prime time; it is ABC in every way.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl attracted just over 130 million viewers, up about
3 percent from last year. That pushed ABC well ahead of CBS and NBC
for the lead in average weekly total viewers. ABC is averaging 13.7
million viewers a week while CBS and NBC are each averaging about
12.9 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, which tied NBC last week among the 18-to-49-year-old
viewers that both networks consider their true measure of network
leadership, zoomed ahead convincingly. ABC is averaging a 5.5
rating with that group compared with 5.2 for NBC. Each rating point
in that category represents 124,480 viewers.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Millionaire'' likely to dominate every week through the
end of this season (all three editions of ``Millionaire'' last week
were among the Top 10 programs), and with the Academy Awards show
still to come, ABC seems the safest bet to win a race since George
W. Bush last ran for governor in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Stu Bloomberg, the co-chairman of ABC
Entertainment, refused again Tuesday to predict an ABC victory.
``I'm still not going out on a limb,'' Bloomberg said, saying he
was too superstitious to make long-range forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   He did admit that he and his partner, Lloyd Braun, had made one
big Super Bowl-related decision with an eye toward the ratings
sweep month that starts Thursday. Rather than introduce a new
series as the show to follow the Super Bowl _ as has often been
done in the past, with very little success _ ABC stuck with its
regular Sunday night at 10 show, ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, predictably, was the biggest audience ever for that
drama. ``The other networks almost always have movies on Sundays,
so there is no regular 10 p.m. show,'' Bloomberg said. ``We just
thought it made sense to leave on the show that always goes
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But ABC asked the show's creator, David E. Kelley, to deliver a
two-part episode, so that Part 1 could capture that big postgame
audience. ``Then Part 2 would be on the first Sunday of the
sweep,'' Bloomberg said. If viewers really want to find out who
killed the woman in the car trunk they have to come back next week.
</P>
<P>
   Creating the two-parter had always been in Kelley's plans, but
for a different reason. He had planned a crossover stunt so that
the characters from his show ``Snoops'' would turn up on ``The
Practice'' and vice versa. ( Kelley did that with success two
seasons ago with ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The Practice,'' both of
which were then on Monday nights, though on different networks.)
</P>
<P>
   But by the time it came to shoot the episodes, ABC had already
canceled ``Snoops,'' so Kelley rewrote the episode as a two-part
``Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg said Kelly was ``totally enthusiastic'' about getting
the spot behind the game for his two-part exercise.
</P>
<P>
   One good bit of news for all the networks during Super Bowl
week: The broadcasters generally added viewers. The six networks
added an average of more than a million viewers for Super Bowl week
this year over the same week last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings Report Card
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other Nielsen ratings winners and losers from
other channels:
</P>
<P>
   _ A&AMP;E, riding a biography of Oprah Winfrey and a movie about
George Washington, had the best month in its 16-year history. (The
channel started on Feb. 1, 1984.) The edition about Winfrey had the
highest rating ever for ``Biography,'' A&AMP;E's most successful
series. The channel's original movie, ``The Crossing,'' about
Washington's decision to outflank the British by crossing the
Delaware River at night, led the channel to its highest week ever,
the week of Jan. 9.
</P>
<P>
   _ A special edition of the CBS newsmagazine ``48 Hours'' on
Monday scored the best rating for that program in six years. It was
helped by coverage of the crash of the Alaska Airlines jet off the
California coast in the program's first segment.
</P>
<P>
   _ The race among the prime-time news talk shows favored the Fox
News channel in January, as Bill O'Reilly pulled in more viewers
than either of the two far more publicized hosts on CNBC, Geraldo
Rivera and Chris Matthews, though Rivera was on vacation in January
and Matthews has shifted the live edition of his show to MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   In January, O'Reilly averaged 366,000 viewers a day for his talk
show, ``The O'Reilly Factor.'' Matthews, whose ``Hardball'' on CNBC
at 9 is a repeat of his show on MSNBC at 8, averaged about 362,000
viewers a day in January, down about 36 percent from the same month
last year.
</P>
<P>
   _ The falloff from the impeachment year was also apparent in
ratings for CNN. In prime time, CNN was down 27 percent from the
comparable period last year.

HIGH COURT DECISION ON ELECTION DISTRICTS COMES UNDER ATTACK _ AND
PRAISE

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trim) 
 
By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Civil rights advocates are assailing a recent
Supreme Court ruling that will make it difficult for U.S. officials
to reject proposed majority-white election districts as being
biased against minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   But champions of states rights are praising the decision, saying
it will allow governing bodies to redraw districts with less fear
that the federal government will step in and stop them.
</P>
<P>
   In its 5-4 decision Jan. 24, the high court limited the
authority of the attorney general and U.S. judges to invalidate
proposed changes to election districts under the 1965 Voting Rights
Act.
</P>
<P>
   No longer can the federal government reject proposed changes in
voting districts simply because they were redrawn to discriminate
against minority voters, the court said. Now, the attorney general
and judges can turn aside redistricting proposals only if they
would weaken the voting strength of minorities, such as by reducing
their percentage of a district's voting population, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Voting Rights Act, states and localities with a
history of discriminating against minority voters must get the
approval of the attorney general or a federal judge before
redrawing their voting districts. Governing bodies without a
checkered past need not get federal ``pre-clearance'' for their
proposed changes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pre-clearance requirement has been a thorn in the side of
Texas officials.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, then-Texas Secretary of State Tony Garza urged Congress
to remove the state from the pre-clearance mandate. But his effort
was successfully blocked by rights groups with strong influence on
Capitol Hill, including the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund and the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Minority advocates, such as People for the American Way, had
long relied on the federal oversight to prevent incumbent white
officials from redrawing districts in a discriminatory manner to
ensure they remain majority-white. Minorities and like-minded
attorneys general and judges used the Voting Rights Act not merely
to preserve minority voting strength but to enhance it by requiring
that many majority-white districts be redrawn.
</P>
<P>
   In light of that history, People for the American Way President
Ralph Neas derided the high court's decision as ``incomprehensible
and unconscionable.'' The Voting Rights Act, rather than being a
law that improves the minority vote, is now a statute that allows
governing bodies to keep minorities in an inferior position at
election time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Carvin, a lawyer for a Louisiana school board that
won high court approval to change its districts, lauded the
decision as a ``very important victory'' for states. He said the
ruling will let states and localities redraw districts next year
without fear that the Justice Department will be able to reject
their proposals as discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general, if she opposes the proposed redistricting,
will now have to show that the votes of minorities would diminish
as a result, Carvin said.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the high court cleared the way for the Bossier
Parish School Board in Louisiana to redraw the election districts
for its 12 members. Attorney General Janet Reno had invalidated the
proposed change, saying it was drawn with the intention of
discriminating against black voters.
</P>
<P>
   But the high court, in an opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia,
said the attorney general may not consider the purpose of the
proposed change, only whether the votes of minorities will be
weaker as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Scalia's opinion were Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist, and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor and
Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter led the four dissenting justices in
criticizing the court for allowing states and localities to ``pour
old poison into new bottles'' by redrawing election districts that
continue to keep minority voting strength at the same low level.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, in passing the Voting Rights Act, never intended to
allow governments to discriminate against minority voters, Souter
said. Rather, the law was a congressional effort to enforce the
15th Amendment, which granted blacks and other racial minorities
the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its (the law's) object is to bring the country closer to
transcending a history of intransigence to enforcement of the 15th
Amendment,'' Souter wrote. ``Now, however, the promise of (the law)
is substantially diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Souter's dissent were Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Ruth
Bader Ginsburg and John Paul Stevens.

FUNERAL SAVES MAN'S LIFE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ When he got word that a close cousin had
died, longtime Santa Rosa resident Ken Molinaro canceled his
reservation on Monday's Alaska Airlines Flight 261 out of Puerto
Vallarta and instead headed east for a funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261 crashed off the Ventura County coastline Monday
afternoon. All 88 aboard were feared dead, Federal Aviation
Administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a reservation on this flight,'' a shocked Molinaro said
Monday night by phone in Pennsylvania. ``I'm speechless. I was told
to ``thank your cousin who died, he saved your life.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Molinaro has lived most of his life in Santa Rosa but moved
about six years ago to Puerto Vallarta, where he lives with his
wife, Alma, and works as a developer. But about twice a month, he
flies into San Francisco to come home to Santa Rosa to take care of
business as a produce broker for G&AMP;G Super Market and to see his
mother, Barbara Molinaro.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's flight would have been standard fare for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go back and forth all the time,'' he said. ``I always fly
Alaska, without exception. It was my standard flight. I'm a
creature of habit.''
</P>
<P>
   But his plans changed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call that a cousin who I was very, very close to had
passed away. So I changed things around and flew ... to Pittsburgh
on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Molinaro learned of the crash while leaving a Pittsburgh funeral
home Monday. He had just turned on his cell phone when it rang. It
kept ringing well into the night with calls from friends and family
wanting to make sure he was all right.
</P>
<P>
   The first call was from a friend in Napa.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, ``I'm so glad to hear your voice.' I said `why?' and
she told me.''
</P>
<P>
   He was headed for a family gathering and had planned on sipping
a soda. ``I had a brandy instead.''

TNT LETS `FREEDOM SONG' RING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood has found a wealth of stories in the civil rights
movement of the 1950s and '60s, tapping into the well-documented
activities of Malcolm X, Medgar Evers and other leaders and
notorious events such as the disappearance of three civil rights
workers in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Such films often have been based on public records, news
accounts and historians' views _ a top-down perspective that casts
millions of individuals scattered across small Southern towns as
little more than extras in the shadow of history makers.
</P>
<P>
   But with ``Freedom Song,'' premiering Feb. 27, TNT offers a
different take, looking at the men, women and children in one
Mississippi town who tried on their own to battle segregation and
fight for the right to vote and, with the assistance of outside
organizers, made it happen.
</P>
<P>
   In a time of vast databases capable of sorting documents,
articles and other resources, writer-director Phil Alden Robinson
did much of his research the old-fashioned way: by listening to the
people who were there.
</P>
<P>
   He'd read Taylor Branch's book ``Parting the Waters,'' about the
Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and its staging
of lunch-counter sit-ins at southern dime stores and bus stations.
When Robinson met with SNCC veterans about making a movie, they
humbly declined to be its focus, saying the real heroes were the
residents of those small towns who faced the consequences from
angry white racists after the SNCC volunteers moved on to their
next protest site.
</P>
<P>
   So not long after the 1989 release of his most popular film,
``Field of Dreams,'' Robinson knocked on the doors of some of the
men and women who met in a lamplit barn to launch an NAACP chapter,
who taught their friends and neighbors how to fill out a voter
registration form designed to trip them up, who risked their
businesses, their homes, even their lives in pursuit of basic
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who is white, said he encountered some initial
hesitation from his African-American subjects over his race and his
unofficial membership in the Hollywood establishment, but he
convinced them this project would be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they've heard before was people saying, `I just finished
a movie about you,''' Robinson said. ``Essentially, our approach
was, `You tell us what happened. I want to know your point of view,
and I can't get that on my own.'''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson pitched his script to studios in the mid-'90s but was
turned down everywhere. Then Danny Glover, who was interested in
one of the roles, steered the director toward TNT and joined as
executive producer on ``Freedom Song.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover plays fictional character Will Walker, whose relationship
with his son Owen (Vicellous Shannon of ``The Hurricane'') is
scarred by an incident years earlier, when Owen wandered into a
whites-only bus station diner and Will beat him publicly at the
demand of a white man rather than defending their right to be
there.
</P>
<P>
   Will isn't a larger-than-life hero, but one who symbolizes the
generations who struggled with how to affect change while worrying
about the safety of their families and the security of their jobs
and businesses. It was their sons and daughters, not yet burdened
by responsibilities and fears, who marched or crossed whites-only
barriers and were hauled off to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Glover, now 52, was a teen-ager in San Francisco during 1961
when McComb, Miss., and other towns were stirring with protests. He
heard many of the same news reports that spurred northern SNCC
volunteers to support their southern brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that stuff was so part of our national culture,'' he said,
recalling how television brought it to life for millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   Glover said even though he was too young to take action like the
teen-agers in ``Freedom Song,'' the importance of the movement
``hit home from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I saw black people on television for the first
time en masse,'' he said. ``I hadn't seen that many (blacks) in any
other part of the cultural life of the nation. I'd see an
occasional black musical on film, you know, `Cabin in the Sky,'
`Green Pastures,' all the kind of state-of-the-art happy black
people _ you know, funny, stupid black people.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover said TV news footage helped changed that image for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw people with ties on and people saying, `Hey, we're going
to change this,' and their voices spoke with authority, black
people speaking with authority and not scratching their heads and
(humming), and not getting scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my first current events class,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glover said he also was influenced by his own parents' activism.
They were postal employees and were involved in organizing their
union.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was all this energy and all this activity, and you're on
the cusp of it, right there, listening to it, hearing it,'' he
said. ``You're privy to the conversation, you're privy to the
meeting at your house.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it's important for kids to listen to adults and
hear what adults talk about,'' he said, referring to it as
``healthy eaves-dropping.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter is the person she is now no doubt because of the
dialogue she was privy to. It was a dialogue of activism.''
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Mandisa, a New York University senior, was with
Glover last fall when he took an activist stance on a particular
prejudice issue. Glover filed a formal complaint in New York City
about cab drivers' apparent fears of picking up African-American
passengers after he and Mandisa were passed by repeatedly while
trying to hail a taxi.
</P>
<P>
   During this interview, however, he was more concerned about
discrimination in mass media.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attack on me as a human being begins long before someone
uses a derogatory term,'' he said. ``It comes from the very onset
from what I see on television, from who I see on television, how
I'm represented and not represented on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, I wanted to be a cowboy,'' he said, talking again of his
childhood. ``But I didn't see any black cowboys there (on TV).
Twenty-five years after I wanted to be a cowboy, I read books
saying that on any given trail ride, three out of five of the
cowboys were black or Hispanic.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed as he recalled the main reason he liked the 1943
movie ``The Ox-Bow Incident'' as a boy: ``One of the guys was a
black cowboy, and he didn't look like the cook.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover said living in a cosmopolitan, forward-thinking city like
San Francisco probably made him more aware of the movement than if
he had grown up in some other American cities. The latest actions
of Martin Luther King Jr. and other events were frequent topics in
his social studies classes.
</P>
<P>
   But even without that advantage, even if his parents hadn't been
politically active, he believes he would have recognized the
importance of the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a part of it whether I wanted to be a part of it or
not,'' he said. ``I didn't have a choice that I was part of this
momentous occasion ... because what it was and what it gave clarity
and voice to was something that was part of me.'' &QL;

SEPARATIST CHECHEN REBELS ABANDON CAPITAL CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After losing two top commanders, rebel leaders in
Chechnya said Tuesday they were abandoning the capital Grozny,
where they had been fighting off Russian troops for months.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 Chechen fighters broke through a Russian blockade
and headed for separatist guerrilla strongholds in the mountainous
south, rebel leaders said. Russian military officials stopped short
of claiming that Grozny had fallen, but they did say the war seemed
to be turning in Moscow's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a turning point in the fight for Grozny. The
city will be taken in a matter of days,'' said Russia's top
commander in the battle, Colonel General Viktor Kazantsev, in a
statement quoted by news agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Russian forces appeared to be finally winning the
battle for Grozny, it was clear that they were still a long way
from winning the war. The rebel strategy has been to hold out as
long as possible and inflict high losses on Russian troops _ along
the way turning the city into a virtual death trap _ and then
retreat to fight another day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rebels are fighting a classic guerrilla war. Now they will
go to their fortified bunkers in the mountains. They will attack
and retreat, appear and disappear,'' said Yevgeny Volk, a military
analyst at the Heritage Foundation in Moscow. ``The Chechens want
to protract the war because they know that a long war will alienate
public opinion and put pressure on the Russian government to
negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the pattern in Russia's 1994-96 war in Chechnya, which
claimed an estimated 80,000 lives and resulted in a humiliating
withdrawal by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   During that war Chechen guerrillas abandoned Grozny in March
1995, after months of fighting that decimated Russia's poorly
trained troops. The rebels continued to mount hit-and-run raids
until they retook the capital in a surprise attack in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels said two top field commanders _ Aslambek Ismailov,
who led the defense of Grozny, and Khunkarpasha Israpilov _ had
been killed in Tuesday's fighting. Grozny Mayor Lecha Dudayev,
nephew of Chechnya's late president Dzhokhar Dudayev, was killed
Sunday, the rebels announced.
</P>
<P>
   There were unconfirmed reports that feared Chechen field
commander Shamil Basayev had lost a leg when his car hit a mine.
</P>
<P>
   A statement on the separatists' Internet site quoted Basayev as
saying the fighters ``had fulfilled their task'' in Grozny. The
statement also said the rebels would ``continue their struggle
according to the plans for the defense'' of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Movaldi Udugov, the separatists' main spokesman, was quoted by
Reuters as saying that the rebels have ``completely withdrawn from
the city.'' But other news reports, citing rebel sources, said some
separatist divisions remained in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian officials denied outright that the rebel fighters
had fled the capital. Russian military officials had hoped to trap
the rebels inside Grozny to prevent them from continuing their
guerrilla war from the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody will ever allow the rebels to leave the city other than
under a white flag and after laying down their weapons,'' Igor
Sergeyev, Russia's defense minister, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Alexander Veklich, a Russian military spokesman in
Grozny, told NTV television that groups of rebels had tried to
break out on the capital's western outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now these groups are being destroyed,'' Veklich said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops marched into Chechnya in September after rebels
staged a series of raids into the neighboring Russian region of
Dagestan. The Kremlin also blames the separatists for a series of
apartment bombings in Moscow and other cities that killed more than
300 people.
</P>
<P>
   After easily occupying Chechnya's flat northern regions, Russian
troops have been bogged down for months trying to take heavily
fortified Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Russian commanders claimed to have captured the
strategic Minutka Square, which they had been trying to take for
two weeks. The square is considered important because it connects
several main thoroughfares and is considered a staging ground for
an attack on the city center.
</P>
<P>
   But after prematurely claiming victory in the past, this time
the Kremlin was being cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been many reports of great victories by the Russian
forces which all turned out to be false. The Russian side has
become more cautious in its claims to avoid appearing foolish
again,'' the Heritage Foundation's Volk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite clear that this war is far from over,'' he added.

TO HELP ECONOMY, THAI GOVERNMENT OFFERS BONDS TO SMALL INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ Blinking behind crooked, wire-rimmed
spectacles, Niteya Saraikan, a 65-year-old retiree, listened
patiently as a central bank employee explained how to fill out the
forms needed for her to help Thailand finance the rescue of its
banking system and return to economic health.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the billions of dollars Thailand has already
received from such awesome sources of wealth as Japan and the
International Monetary Fund, Niteya's contribution of 500,000 Thai
baht, or about $13,400 at current exchange rates, is puny. But
sitting around here under tents behind the Bank of Thailand one
recent day were hundreds of the country's prodigious savers, checks
in hand, waiting for their chance to buy 5 billion baht in
five-year government bonds that pay 6.4 percent in interest
annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest rates outside are just too low,'' said a factory
worker, Anongsai Mahaguna, who with a friend scraped together 2
million baht, the most the bank would allow any single applicant to
invest.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand's government does not usually borrow directly from the
public, instead auctioning its bonds to banks and other financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But efforts to stimulate consumer spending by pushing interest
rates low have failed, so it has turned to selling bonds to people
like Niteya to put back into the economy part of a growing lode of
bank deposits almost equal in size to the entire Thai economy.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand's predicament is similar to that faced by countries
around the region that were severely hurt when the Asian financial
crisis struck more than two years ago. Though exports and
government spending have returned Southeast Asia's economies to
growth, economists warn that they will soon need to convince wary
consumers to start spending more so that companies can pay loans
and banks can start lending again.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand's banks, for example, are still struggling under
roughly 2.2 trillion baht in nonperforming loans. To help dig them
out and stimulate the economy, the government has embarked on a
program of deficit spending, with plans to go into the red by 110
billion baht in the year ending this September.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Thailand's Finance Ministry issued its first
so-called savings bonds to the public in nine years. Hundreds of
eager buyers descended on the Bank of Thailand's offices, where the
bonds are sold, to get their piece of the 25 billion baht issue. In
December, the government sold the public 10 billion baht more.
Another issue in January sold out in just a few hours, leaving more
than 1,000 disappointed investors holding nothing more than slips
of paper with handwritten numbers marking their place in line.
</P>
<P>
   Clutching their numbers for another chance to buy the bonds,
members of the public began lining up at the Bank of Thailand's
headquarters here as early as 7 a.m. on a recent morning. ``We've
never seen it like this before,'' said central bank officer Buncha
Suikhong as he ticked off each investor's number after they had
submitted their paperwork.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The scene was more Garden Circle than get-rich-quick. In their
costume jewelry and dowdy skirt-suits, the matronly investors
gathered in neat rows on the lawn outside the bank were quietly
calculating. Bank deposit rates have fallen to as low as 2.5
percent, which combined with inflation that Standard Chartered Bank
economist Andrew Dermot Fung projects will rise to four percent
this year, means that it actually costs Thais money to keep their
money in a savings account.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent economic crisis, Thais still put away about
one-third of their income on average. By the latest measure, they
have 4.65 trillion baht in savings. ``It's not like a lot of people
had no money in the bank because of the crisis,'' said Fung.
</P>
<P>
   Many savers, moreover, view the interest rates on their deposits
as the foundation for all their investments, analysts say. ``There
are still some people in Thailand who believe that deposits create
wealth,'' said Donaldson Hartman, a banking analyst at Salomon
Smith Barney. ``And when deposit rates fall, they'll tend to keep
out of other investments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stocks are too risky,'' explained one woman sitting in the
tropical heat waiting for her number, 1,400, to be called in the
most recent auction.
</P>
<P>
   Within just a few hours, 5 billion baht in government savings
bonds were sold out.

IRISH, BRITISH CLASH AS SHARED ULSTER GOVERNMENT FALTERS 
</HEADLINE>

   BELFAST _ Faced with the imminent collapse of Northern Ireland's
two-month-old local government, Irish and British officials clashed
Tuesday night on how best to prevent the unraveling of the
painstakingly crafted peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The latest crisis was triggered when an international commission
reported Tuesday, as expected, that the IRA has not yet agreed to
dump any of its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As officials huddled to try to work out their differences on how
to respond to the report, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern told
the Irish Parliament in Dublin that suspending the power-sharing
government until the arms dispute could be worked out would be ``a
disaster.'' The British government, however, does not want to let
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble keep his vow to walk out of
the Northern Island Assembly, fearing that hard-line unionists will
take over.
</P>
<P>
   The report, delivered by Canadian General John de Chastelain to
the British and Irish governments, was not released. However,
sources in both regimes said the panel concluded that neither the
Irish Republican Army nor its loyalist adversaries had agreed even
in principle to turn in their arms, let alone to a timetable.
</P>
<P>
   While the loyalists are as reluctant to start disarming, it is
the IRA's refusal to commit to turning in weapons that threatens to
bring down Northern Ireland's new local government, which includes
Protestant unionists who want to retain the union with Britain and
Catholic republicans who want to merge with the Irish Republic.
When it took office in December, the new government took back from
London the power to run Northern Ireland's affairs for the first
time in 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA issued a statement Tuesday insisting that it would
continue to observe its cease-fire and that it was committed to a
``permanent peace.'' The IRA said it had met with de Chastelain
three times in the last eight weeks but made no commitment to turn
in its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, who is first minister of the assembly, said he expected
the political institutions created under the Good Friday Agreement
of 1998 to be suspended within days. He has vowed to bring down the
power-sharing government unless the IRA shows it is serious about
turning in its arsenal, and Tuesday he said the IRA's refusal to
turn in any weapons by now proved it wasn't sincere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took risks,'' Trimble said. ``The republicans are not
reciprocating.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble and his party, which represents most Protestants in
Northern Ireland, agreed to form a government that includes two
Cabinet ministers from Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, but
only with the understanding that the IRA commit to begin
decommissioning its arsenal by the end of January. He is set to
meet his party's council on Feb. 12, and had promised to resign by
then if the IRA did not begin disarming.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said Trimble had no right to set
deadlines unilaterally and insisted his party had fulfilled its
commitments under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that sought to end
30 years of conflict in Northern Ireland. That agreement said
paramilitary groups should finish disarming by May, but it set no
date for the process to begin.
</P>
<P>
   British Secretary of State Peter Mandelson met Tuesday in Dublin
with his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, trying to forge a
last-minute compromise that would avoid plunging Northern Ireland
into another political crisis just two months after it celebrated
the creation of the power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson may be forced to suspend the government and the
cross-border agencies that were created in December and reimpose
direct rule from London, rather than allow Trimble to resign. If
Trimble resigns and the government collapses, it would be much more
difficult to reconstitute it, procedurally and politically.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA is bitterly divided over making even a token gesture on
weapons, and many in the organization see it as an act of
surrender. Its leaders are terrified at the prospect of a split.
But Trimble said the bulk of his party will not take part in a
government that includes Sinn Fein while it maintains ``a private
army.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson said he was encouraged that the IRA had told de
Chastelain that it would maintain its cease-fire and remained
committed to peace. But, he added, ``It doesn't demonstrate
sufficient progress on decommissioning,'' the word used for
disarming.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Trimble nor Adams ruled out calling again for help from
George Mitchell, the former US Senate majority leader from Maine
who had worked out the elaborate compromise that is slowly
unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be embarrassed to ask him, but . . .'' Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious crisis,'' Adams warned. ``If this process
collapses, I don't know how we're going to put it together again.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams's colleague, Martin McGuinness, a former IRA commander who
has been education minister for two months, said if moderate
unionists walk out, hard-line unionist leader Ian Paisley, who has
tried to wreck the peace process for years, would be the winner. He
said he had watched Paisley laughing at Trimble's discomfort on
television in the assembly members' lounge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to throw away, in one fell swoop, all the
hard-gotten gains of the last few years? It's madness,'' said
McGuinness. ``Is the victor in all this going to be Ian Paisley?''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said if the government is suspended, the IRA would likely
pull out of discussions with de Chastelain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decommissioning can be achieved, but not this way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in Washington, President Clinton said the
power-sharing government ``is working. It would be a tragedy if it
were derailed.'' But Clinton, who has been on the phone with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Ahern, and party leaders over
the last two days, said he was going to stay out of the dispute and
let the parties resolve it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Even as republicans and unionists jousted, the day-to-day
politics of the new government carried on. Several thousand farmers
marched on the Stormont parliament building to demand that their
falling prices be matched with subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Adams ruefully pointed out that Tuesday morning, his party
backed a motion by Paisley's party to support the farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize the British government is not going to help the
farmers. We need to help the farmers,'' said Adams. ``That's why
it's so important not to let what we have collapse.''

POLICE CAPTURE HINDU FUGITIVE WHO LED MOB THAT KILLED MISSIONARY
AND 2 SONS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ For more than a year, the police combed dense
forests and remote backwaters in search of India's most wanted
fugitive _ the man suspected of killing an Australian missionary
and his two young sons. The elusiveness of the fugitive, Dara
Singh, had become mythic, with peasants in his obscure haunts
crediting him with supernatural powers, the ability to run faster
than a tiger and to sleep suspended in midair.
</P>
<P>
   But when the authorities caught Singh late on Monday, he seemed
just another guy on the lam whose number was up. He fell into a
trap after becoming convinced that he needed to carry a gun. A
police decoy had befriended one of Singh's confederates and offered
him a firearm for trade. He was taken to the suspect's jungle
hideout to negotiate a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a fair idea of Dara Singh's movements,'' said Yogesh
Bahadur Khurana, a district superintendent of police in the eastern
state of Orissa. ``On two earlier occasions he narrowly escaped us.
Once, we even fired at him. This time, we used all precautions. We
didn't use police vehicles or wear uniforms. We avoided village
lanes and walked 13 kilometers'' _ about 8 miles _ ``through the
forest. We finally got him at 11 at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh is accused of leading more than 30 men who attacked the
missionary, Graham Staines, and his sons, Philip, 10, and Timothy,
6, as they slept in their jeep in a small village. Wielding sticks
and clubs, the mob refused to let even the screaming boys go free.
They stuffed straw through the smashed windows and set the vehicle
ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   The killings, on Jan. 22 of last year, were a gruesome end for a
highly respected man and his sons. Staines had spent his adult life
running a home for leprosy patients.
</P>
<P>
   But in a country already rocked by a number of attacks against
Christians, the crime also became a cause for national
introspection. Many in India believed that the Bharatiya Janata
Party _ the Hindu nationalists who lead a coalition government _
had created a climate for such intolerance. Indeed, the police
believed that Singh belonged to the Bajrag Dal, an extremist group
associated with the party.
</P>
<P>
   But a judicial inquiry, which issued a report last August,
concluded that Singh was a Hindu ``fanatic'' who was acting on his
own in stirring the mob. He provoked them ``by saying that the
Christian missionaries were destroying the Hindu religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon thereafter, Singh was implicated in two other killings: the
stabbing of a Muslim businessman and an attack on a Catholic priest
with bows and arrows.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, there has been a marked decline in
anti-Christian violence. Still, proselytizing by missionaries
remains controversial, with continuing accusations of forced
conversions. In Orissa, the state where Staines lived and died, the
government has passed an order requiring a police investigation
before a person adopts a new faith.
</P>
<P>
   Gladys Staines, the missionary's widow, has continued his work
with leprosy patients in Orissa. She has become a well-known
figure, often praised as a model of Christian virtue. Since the
death of her husband and sons, she has repeatedly said that she
forgives the killers, although she was unsure God would do the same
unless they repented.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, she spoke to reporters about Singh's capture. ``It has
made me sad that Dara was still able to kill other people, so the
fact that he's not free means he can't do that any more and that
makes me happy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For the police, the arrest brings a great sense of relief. They
have been harshly criticized for their manhunt, leaving them to
lament that Orissa's thick forests present a vast sanctuary and
that villagers were prone to protect Singh.
</P>
<P>
   They described the fugitive as a man of wiles. ``He'd hardly
spend two nights in one place,'' said Khurana, the police
superintendent. ``Most of the time he stayed in thickly forested
villages along the river far from the roads.''
</P>
<P>
   When arrested, the superintendent said, Singh was carrying two
spears and a long, curved knife.

 &HT;    Bradley leaves N.H. a credible candidate
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Democrat Bill Bradley said goodbye to New
Hampshire Tuesday night after campaigning more than a year in the
Granite State in his uphill battle to defeat Vice President Gore
for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley slogged through not one, but two winters in New
Hampshire, proclaiming in scores of town hall meetings that he
would practice a new kind of politics based on personal integrity
and respect for voters.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bradley's appeal in New Hampshire, reflected in polls
over the fall, that transformed him from a very long shot against
Gore into a credible candidate who forced the vice president into a
competitive race.
</P>
<P>
   As Bradley awaited primary returns Tuesday, he spent much of the
afternoon sequestered with aides to review remarks that he plans to
give in a flurry of campaign stops between today and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will make a morning appearance in Hartford, Conn., a key
primary state for him, and an afternoon stop in New York City,
where he remains a well-known sports figure from his basketball
playing days with the New York Knicks in the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Then he flies to California, which sends the largest number of
delegates to the presidential nominating convention. All three
states, along with Georgia and eight others, hold primaries on
March 7. Regardless of Tuesday's outcome, Bradley has vowed to
fight on until March.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a former three-term senator from New Jersey, visited
three polling places in southern and eastern New Hampshire Tuesday
to shake hands with voters as they entered the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Patty McKenzie and Chris Singleton greeted Bradley in Hampton,
N.H., with basketballs for him to sign. ``We're huge fans,''
McKenzie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like all his ideas,'' said Singleton. ``He's so fresh.
He seems to relate to the real people.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped in a black parka and wearing tan, Timberland boots,
Bradley was handed a cup of vegetable soup as he stood outside the
Marston School to greet voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going the extra mile to show voters respect,'' Bradley
explained. ``And that's what I'm about.''
</P>
<P>
   One reporter asked Bradley how his late father, a small-town
Missouri banker, would have felt about his son's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he would have been proud of his son,'' said Bradley,
who frequently invoked his father, Warren Bradley, on the campaign
trail. ``He was always proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley refused to predict victory and defined success as simply
``doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier aides informed Bradley that he and Sen. John
McCain (R-Ariz.) had polled the most votes in Dixville Notch and
Hart's Location, two tiny precincts that record their votes just
after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley wasn't surprised. In the days before Tuesday's
balloting, he had personally called the half-dozen Democratic
families in both areas to solicit their votes.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to the vote, Bradley sought to turn the
tide against Gore and energize his supporters with sharp attacks on
Gore's integrity and truthfulness. He accused Gore of practicing
the ``old politics'' of a ``thousand promises and a thousand
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to be a leader in the mold of presidents Franklin D.
Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson, who who tackled big problems and
enacted Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his final campaign stops Monday, Bradley seemed to
grasp that his long year in New Hampshire was finally coming to a
close. He sounded almost wistful in remarks to voters in Derry,
N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting a poem he liked, Bradley said that life's greatest
tragedy was to die with ``commitments undefined, convictions
unexpressed and service unfulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent a lifetime defining my commitments,'' Bradley told
three hundred supporters crowded into the auditorium of an old
opera house. ``I've spent a lifetime expressing my convictions. Now
it's up to the people of New Hampshire and the people of this
country to see if my service will be fulfilled.''

 &HT;    McCain seeking big S.C. gains
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _Two South Carolinians with a low tolerance for the
cold and snow hopped aboard John McCain's campaign bus this week in
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressmen Lindsey Graham and Mark Sanford are
McCain's best-known supporters in South Carolina. If it had not
been clear before, their arrival signaled that McCain's gaze had
turned to the South.
</P>
<P>
   He had all year to make new friends in New Hampshire, a strategy
that put him atop the polls in the state before Tuesday's primary.
He has 17 days to try it again in South Carolina before its Feb. 19
Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain visited polling places in New Hampshire Tuesday morning
and also appeared on Don Imus' radio program. He canceled later
visits to voting precincts, saying the horde of cameras that
accompanies him angered some voters.
</P>
<P>
   But the campaign already had prepared for a quick exit from New
Hampshire once the results were known.
</P>
<P>
   McCain chartered a jet to fly to South Carolina immediately
following the New Hampshire primary. He is trailing Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas by 20 points in a new poll there, but that was a big
improvement over polls late last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not his first visit to South Carolina,'' Graham said.
``People who get involved in all this know John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain conceded the obvious. ``We have no illusions that
the battle is still uphill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina has a history of helping the choice of Republican
party leaders and stopping the campaigns of challengers in their
tracks. It worked for President Bush in 1992, after Pat Buchanan
ran well in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor has the support of former Gov. Carroll
Campbell, whose statewide organization is renowned for its ability
to turn out a strong vote. McCain supporters think that Campbell's
organization may be less effective now that a Democrat, Jim Hodges,
is governor.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in New Hampshire, McCain will not have the luxury of
spending every day in South Carolina over the next two and a half
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   His need for campaign money to sustain an effort that will play
coast-to-coast beginning in early March will take him to
fund-raising events in California, New York and Washington during
the next eight days. In Washington, he also will try to raise money
through a $100-a-person ``cyber conference,'' an Internet-based
fund-raiser that is planned for Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The quickening pace of primaries also will test the campaign's
ability to compete on more than one front at a time. But none of
that will matter if McCain does not fare well in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is in relatively good shape along the South Carolina
coast, where voters are less socially conservative and many have
ties to the Northeast, Sanford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem area will be Greenville-Spartanburg,'' Sanford
said of the state's most populous region.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who is likely to run for the U.S. Senate in 2002 when
Strom Thurmond retires, is enormously popular in his state as a
result of serving as one of the prosecutors in President Clinton's
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Graham could play a crucial role in thwarting criticism of
McCain as not sufficiently conservative for South Carolina voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Bill Clinton and he ain't no Bill Clinton,'' Graham
said. ``He's his polar opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's strategy is to use the results from New Hampshire to
undermine Bush's position as the unstoppable front-runner. ``If we
can get voters to do comparison shopping, we'll be OK,'' Graham
said. ``'Explain to me why you're a better candidate than John
McCain.' If we get in that debate, we win.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is much larger than New Hampshire, but McCain
plans to use his campaign bus, the Straight Talk Express, to carry
him across the state, ``where we have nice long stretches
together,'' he told reporters.

 &HT;    Reunion echoes spirit of historic sit-in
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Forty years after sparking the South's sit-in
movement at the Woolworth's lunch counter here, three former
college classmates returned Tuesday and urged young people to rally
against racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not suggesting you go out there and die ... but the worst
thing in the world you can do is do nothing,'' Franklin McCain told
students, civil rights leaders and others at North Carolina A&AMP;T
State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ought not ever ask for permission to start a revolution,''
said McCain, joining Joseph McNeill and Jibreel Khazan for a 40th
anniversary celebration of the Woolworth's sit-in. A fourth
classmate, David Richmond, died in 1990, but his son and daughter
represented him.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;T Chancellor James Renick used the occasion to announce that,
starting next year, the historically black state university will
award an international human rights medal, reflecting the spirit of
the Woolworth's sit-in.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 1, 1960, the four A&AMP;T freshmen challenged the Jim Crow
laws that denied blacks equal access to public accommodations, such
as seats in restaurants and on buses.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of the South's civil rights movement, the
four sat at the whites-only Woolworth's counter and ordered coffee,
which they were denied, McNeill said.
</P>
<P>
   They returned again to Woolworth's, joined by others. The
peaceful protest drew national publicity, sparking civil
disobedience that led to integration in restaurants and public
accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the three 58-year-olds signed autographs and gave
advice to young people a generation after the protest of
discriminatory laws that, McNeill said, ``destroy the human
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Dredging up old nicknames, the three hugged and laughed in the
A&AMP;T cafeteria, decorated by a large painting that includes four
young men walking together.
</P>
<P>
   McNeill, of Long Island, N.Y., and McCain, of Charlotte, dressed
conservatively in dark suits and ties. But Khazan (formerly Ezell
Blair Jr.) of New Bedford, Mass., wore long dreadlocks and an Arab
scarf.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did Greensboro proud,'' City Councilwoman Claudette
Burroughs-White said at a breakfast gathering, the first of several
anniversary events that will include a televised forum at the
downtown Woolworth's store.
</P>
<P>
   Closed since 1993, the five-and-dime is the proposed site of a
civil rights museum, but efforts to raise $10.5 million are running
several years behind.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has expressed dismay at the museum's slow progress,
urged young people not to be apathetic about civil rights. He
described opponents of affirmative action and others who would
``turn back the clock'' as ``the vicious lion running loose in the
street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is for you to seize this lion and shut its
mouth,'' said McCain, encouraging youth to get involved in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do know that not enough of you are registered (to vote), not
enough of you vote on this campus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by the belief that segregation ``was one of the worst
evils,'' McNeill said the sit-in's organizers envisioned a
prolonged demonstration that would be ``nonviolent'' and
``inclusive,'' drawing protesters besides those from A&AMP;T students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to take on something difficult because we had
then something that seems elusive now,'' McNeill said. ``And that
was faith _ faith in the thought that what we were doing was right,
faith to keep coming back day after day.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite inequalities in the late 1950s, such as separate
sidewalks in Greensboro for black people and white people, Khazan
said he initially was reluctant to protest because he feared being
jailed.
</P>
<P>
   McNeill urged him on, saying ``Brother Blair, it is time to
go.''

US WOMEN GET PAYCHECK PARITY WITH MEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US women's soccer team will be back in uniform Sunday
against archrival Norway after agreeing to a five-year contract
with their federation that guarantees them paycheck parity with the
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge step for women in sports,'' said captain Carla
Overbeck after she and her world-champion teammates accepted a deal
that will earn them six figures apiece this year. ``We have been
fighting for this for the last 12 years. We love the game of soccer
and wanted to play it as a career. Now, the younger women will be
able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Americans already were the highest-paid women's
soccer team in the world, they balked at continuing an arrangement
that paid them less in appearance fees and bonuses than the US men.
Without a new contract, the team refused to play in last month's
Australia Cup, which was won by an American reserve team made up of
collegians and high schoolers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed that what we were doing was right and had the
support of the nation behind us,'' said Overbeck, a 31-year-old
mother who has been a team member since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old contract, which expired last summer, the women
received $3,150 a month. The new one, which will cover the 2000 and
2004 Olympics and the next World Cup (in either 2002 or 2003),
guarantees the top players $5,000 a month against $2,000 appearance
fees for each of more than 30 potential matches, plus a substantial
bonus for winning Olympic and world titles and three months'
severance pay if they are dropped from the pool. The players will
continue to receive paid maternity leave and child care.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement also includes an adjustment provision that
guarantees the women the same percentage of their gross revenues
that the men get.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to be realistic and fair,'' said former federation
president Alan Rothenberg, who was US Soccer's lead negotiator.
``There are some areas where the women will get benefits the men
don't. There are some where the men will get benefits the women
don't. And there are some where the benefits are identical. But
overall there is gender equity and parity.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they play by the same rules, the men and women on the US
teams don't play in the same world. The men are all paid
professionals, playing either in Major League Soccer or for foreign
clubs. The women, with no pro league (although one is planned),
make money only when they are in camp or playing matches.
</P>
<P>
   FIFA, the international federation, paid US Soccer nearly a
million dollars when the men qualified for the 1998 World Cup in
France. It paid nothing when the women did.
</P>
<P>
   But after the women filled every stadium from the Meadowlands to
the Rose Bowl during last summer's World Cup and inspired a huge
jump in soccer-playing, dues-paying girls, they believed they had
earned the right to equal pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have to be treated equally as men,'' Overbeck said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the team and the federation had been at odds for more
than a month, agreement came quickly after an all-day meeting at
Los Angeles Airport a week ago Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got 95 percent of it taken care of that day,'' said
Rothenberg, who blamed ``unfortunate misunderstandings and
miscommunications'' on the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The team, which knew a contract was certain by last Friday, was
already in camp Tuesday preparing for the friendly with the
Norwegians in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the damaging effects are as severe as many
people think they are,'' said federation president S. Robert
Contiguglia. ``After we beat Norway on Sunday, most things will be
forgotten.''

BOSSES AND WORKERS PROTEST FRANCE'S NEW 35-HOUR WORKWEEK

   PARIS _ Isabelle Dupont was trying to make the best of her
hour-and-a-half walk to work Tuesday. The 35-year-old civil servant
wore sneakers, strolled slowly and ate a croissant on the way. But
like many other Parisians inconvenienced by Tuesday's subway and
bus strikes _ yet another demonstration against the new 35-hour
workweek _ Dupont understood none of the details of the protest and
wondered whether it was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strikes should be a last resort, after all negotiations, which
is not the case today,'' said Dupont, who usually rides the subway
to work.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, she added with a shrug, ``We can't prevent
strikes, it's a right we have in France.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was the deadline for most French companies to begin
adopting a shorter workweek, down from 39 to 35 hours. To mark the
occasion, subway and bus workers joined truckers in protests that
disrupted transportation systems across France.
</P>
<P>
   The truck drivers, who began their protest on Monday, continued
to block more than 60 strategic points, many of them on France's
borders. They allowed cars to pass through but not fellow truckers,
prompting protests for other European countries including the
Netherlands, which asked the European Union to step in.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter workweek has been a centerpiece of the Socialist-led
government's efforts to reduce a stubborn double-digit unemployment
rate that, despite edging down since Lionel Jospin took office as
prime minister in mid-1997, still hovers at 10.6 percent. The idea
behind the shorter workweek is that there is only so much work to
go around, so if some people worked less, new jobs would be
created.
</P>
<P>
   But the program has set off protests from both bosses and
workers. The bosses have taken to the streets saying that 35 hours'
work for 39 hours' pay is too costly and will keep them from being
competitive with other European countries.
</P>
<P>
   Workers have also protested, angered at new work rules, changing
shifts, demands for increased productivity and in some cases
concessions made to various industries. In the last few months,
there have been work slowdowns or strikes at Air France, the post
office, the government television news and radio stations and
hospitals. On Thursday, the country's social security bureaucracy
is expected to be crippled as five unions have called for a strike.
Some of the work actions lead to others. For instance, Tuesday's
truckers strike is a result of a strike three weeks ago by truck
owners. The owners also blockaded border crossings, saying the
shorter workweek and rising fuel costs were driving them to
bankruptcy. Eventually, they wrung concessions from the government,
and now the drivers say those concessions mean that truckers will
not get the same benefits from the new laws that have been given in
other industries.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers met with the Jospin government Tuesday and an
agreement was reached for further discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The government played down the protests. Labor Minister Martine
Aubry told lawmakers in Parliament that the protests were a result
of workers simply ``assuring that they get the best possible
conditions.'' She denied the program was unpopular among workers.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists are skeptical that the 35-hour workweek will
produce anything like the million new jobs originally predicted.
These days, government officials usually use much lower figures.
But some economists say the negotiations may benefit the economy by
prompting a housecleaning in the workplace: outdated and inflexible
contracts are now open to renegotiations.
</P>
<P>
   About half the subways and buses did not run Tuesday, but warned
of the strike many Parisians made plans not to go to school or work
or to get by without public transportation. During the morning rush
hour, the sidewalks were filled with pedestrians and the boulevards
clogged with increased traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Those that went into the subway had to search for a line that
was still running and then suffer long delays. But many passengers
shrugged off the inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting for half an hour,'' said Danielle Magne, 40,
a secretary. ``But there must be a good reason for this strike, so
I support them.''

   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ As family and friends and comrades gathered
at a wake Tuesday afternoon, fellow officers from around the
country began to arrive here by the busload for the funeral of
Cornel Young Jr., a Providence police officer who was shot when two
city patrol officers mistook him for a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Still, though Young will be buried Wednesday with a hero's
honors, the controversy surrounding his death continues to
overshadow the city.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a grass-roots group called Direct Action for Rights and
Equality announced they have planned a sit-in outside of Mayor
Vincent A. Cianci, Jr's, office on Thursday to demand the firing of
the two officers who shot Young during a disturbance outside an
Olneysville late-night diner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shot too quick,'' said Ed Wilkins, 63, a member of the
group who said he plans to participate in the sit-in. ``They didn't
make a sound decision. They snapped and I think the color of Sgt.
Young's skin played a role in this whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Young was black. Providence police have not identified the races
of the two officers involved in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins, who said he is friends with the Young family, said it
was unclear how many protesters are expected.
</P>
<P>
   The group is among several who are pressuring city officials to
use the shooting as an opportunity to address what they say is
institutionalized racism within the police force that has gone
unchecked for years.
</P>
<P>
   Young, 29, was waiting for a take-out order at Fidas Restaurant
when a scuffle broke out, then escalated in the parking lot when
someone called for a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The officers who arrived at the scene, Carlos A. Saraiva and
Michael Solitro, shot Young when he came outside to help with his
gun drawn. Officials say that the officers did not recognize Young,
and that he did not obey their commands to put down his weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Young is the son of police Maj. Cornel Young, the
highest-ranking black officer on the force.
</P>
<P>
   Aldrin Diaz, 30, of Providence, has been charged with felony
murder for his role in the fight that sparked the officers to shoot
Young. His girlfriend, Christa Calder, 27, of Gray, Maine, was also
arrested and could face a similar charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't make sense to me that these two officers
wouldn't recognize a fellow officer. This is a small police
department,'' said one black Providence officer who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``It just doesen't square straight with me,
but I hope the truth comes out.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, officers representing every corner of the country began
to arrive and prepare for Young's funeral. City officials said they
expect up to $4,000 officers to attend the service.
</P>
<P>
   Decked out in dress uniforms, the officers will assemble at the
city's Convention Center and march to Fourth Baptist Church for the
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 1,000 residents, many of whom are civic activists
and ministers, are expected to attend, said Providence Police
Captain Robert T. Kells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's been so supportive,'' said Kells, who serves with
Young's father in the Community Policing Division.
</P>
<P>
   Kells's son, Robert T. Kells Jr., attended the police academy
with Cornel Young Jr., and remained close friends with him
throughout the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very, very, sad and somber situation,'' said Robert
Jr. ``We've lost one of our officers, and the two other officers
who accidently killed one of our own, is grieving. It's a tragic
situation for everyone. '''
</P>
<P>
   Police have remained tight-lipped on officials continued to
downplay the Even as segments of the black community have issued
concerns about racism in the light of the incident, city officials
were downplaying the accusations Tuesday, saying that they believed
that the shooting was a tragic accident. Many white residents
agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officers wouldn't shoot Cornel Young on purpose,'' said
Richard Seidel, 57, a life-time resident of Providence. ``It's sad
that some people think this is the case, but I hope everything
works out fine. We don't need anymore tensions between the races
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the city's prominent black leaders have also urged
residents to remain calm and wait for the facts.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Cianci invited many of these leaders, including Rev,
Virgil W. Wood, president of the Ministerial Alliance of Rhode
Island and pastor of the Pond Street Baptist Church to his home for
a prayer service.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to Wood Tuesday, the mayor cautioned him to
``await the results of the investigation and then procced.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods has expressed anger over the shooting and joined with
other ministers on Monday to call for an independent investigation.
The investigation, currently being handled by Attorney General
Sheldon Whitehouse's office is moving forward, said a spokesman.

BIOGEN SAYS IT HAS DRUG THAT CAN DELAY MS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Biogen Inc. says its multiple sclerosis drug Avonex can delay
the progression of the disease in patients who have early symptoms,
according to a nearly four-year-long study.
</P>
<P>
   The test results indicated Biogen could expand the market for
Avonex beyond those who already take it for a mild form of MS.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge, Mass. biopharmaceutical company said an
evaluation of 383 patients who had a single symptom, such as double
vision, bladder problems, or numbness, were given Avonex once a
week for three years. Biogen said the study met its goal of showing
that a weekly regimen slowed development of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The study shows that early intervention ``can be effective in
delaying the onset of clinically definite MS in high-risk
individuals and confirms the benefit of early treatment of MS,''
said Jim Vincent, Biogen chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term evaluation was so successful that Biogen has
halted the clinical trial to allow patients taking a placebo to
switch to Avonex, the company said. Biogen will now seek US Food
and Drug Administration approval to expand the drug's prescription
labeling to include the new group of potential patients.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 10,000 people are diagnosed annually with MS,
according the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen shares jumped 8 1/8 points to close at 94 on the news.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the
central nervous system that affects about 400,000 people in the
United States, two-thirds of whom are women, many between the ages
of 20 and 40. The disease is caused by the destruction of the fatty
protective tissue, called myelin, that surrounds and protects nerve
fibers and enables the flow of nerve impulses to and from the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Avonex, along with Betaseron, a similar drug developed jointly
by Chiron Corp. and Schering AG, are used to treat a mild form of
MS called ``relapsing remitting.'' Biogen is the leader with 83,000
MS patients taking Avonex, which had $621 million in sales last
year, up 55 percent from $395 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   If the FDA approves the revised labeling, Biogen will be able to
expand the $1 billion-a-year MS drug market. But they won't be
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to grow the market for MS medications is Immunex Corp.
of Seattle with its cancer chemotherapy drug called Novantrone.
Last Friday, an FDA advisory panel unanimously approved the use of
the drug for an estimated 120,000 people in the United States with
a more severe form of MS called ``secondary progressive.'' These MS
patients suffer severe numbness and paralysis. Novantrone may be
the first FDA-approved treatment for the severe form of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   With expected FDA approval, Novantrone will be alone in the
market for secondary progressive patients. However, Chiron has
completed testing Betaseron on secondary progressive patients with
positive results and is seeking FDA approval. A Biogen spokeswoman
said a phase 3 clinical trial of Avonex for these more severe MS
patients is under way.

STOCK-OPTION LETTER A THREAT TO PAY SYSTEM, BUSINESSES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Employee stock-option plans, those broad-based benefits that
have turned some rank-and-file workers into millionaires, could be
imperiled by a Labor Department advisory letter that has many US
firms up in arms.
</P>
<P>
   The hue and cry stems from a 1999 letter in which the Labor
Department informed an unidentified company that earnings from
exercised stock options must be included in base pay when
calculating overtime payments to hourly workers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the letter was written in response to a specific
situation at a particular firm, corporations and business groups
became alarmed because they believe the letter represents the
department's interpretation of employment law.
</P>
<P>
   Once restricted to top executives, stock options are being
offered now to many rank-and-file employees who might not have
qualified previously. A 1999 study of 350 top companies found that
39 percent now offer stock options to lower-level employees. The
William M. Mercer Inc. study also found that in many cases the
plans cover half or more of a firm's employees.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans
(APPWP) in Washington, D.C., asked Labor Secretary Alexis Herman to
rescind the letter. So did the Washington-based LPA, which
represents close to 300 large employers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Labor Department has declined. It says the ruling is
limited to the specific facts contained in a particular employer's
case, and maintains there is no evidence that all stock-option
plans would trigger higher overtime expenses.
</P>
<P>
   But critics aren't satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a congressional Committee on Education and the
Workforce sent a letter to Herman stating that her ruling could
result in a policy that ``will negatively impact hourly paid
employees because many employers may ultimately decide to restrict
participation in stock-option plans to their exempt (executive)
work force.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Waddell, acting assistant labor secretary for public
affairs, could not be reached Tuesday for comment. A spokesman said
he was away from the office.
</P>
<P>
   James Delaplane, vice president of retirement policy for the
APPWP, said employers are worried. ``Companies are afraid because
the ruling contained in that letter could result in burdensome
administrative tracking requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, companies do not have any administrative structures
in place to do the tracking, the data collection, and the
calculations that this ruling would require,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Delaplane said the cost of establishing such a system, plus the
additional overtime expenses, could cause companies to discontinue
plans that permit hourly workers to receive stock options.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Mercer study, 17 percent of the firms surveyed
make actual grants of stock options to a majority of their workers
under a broad-based plan. In 1993, by contrast, only 17 percent of
the companies polled offered stock options to a majority of their
workers, and fewer than 6 percent made grants.
</P>
<P>
   In its opinion letter last year, the Labor Department's Wage and
Hour Division found the profits from stock options should be
regarded, retroactively, as part of the workers' base pay. The
decision, which stated that the employer's stock-option plan was
not exempt from the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act,
significantly boosted overtime pay to company workers.

HOSPITALS BEGIN EFFORT TO BOOST MEDICARE PAYMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The hospital industry Tuesday unveiled a study
saying that it will lose money on Medicare patients, as hospitals
began a campaign to persuade Congress to boost the payments for
serving Medicare seniors.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, hospitals have complained bitterly about
Medicare cutbacks that Congress approved in 1997 as it moved to
balance the federal budget. Nationwide, hospitals have said the
federal cutbacks, combined with payment cuts from insurance
companies, are responsible for steep financial losses.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred hospital officials and caregivers rallied on
Capitol Hill Tuesday as the annual American Hospital Association
meetings here came to a close. Officials of the trade group said
2,000 people attended the meetings, and many lobbied their local
lawmakers before leaving town.
</P>
<P>
   They were armed with a new study for the hospital trade
association by the Lewin Group, which said that nearly 60 percent
of hospitals will lose money on Medicare patients by the year 2004.
The average profit margin on Medicare patients will be negative 6.6
percent that year, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   That picture is slightly brighter than in a similar Lewin Group
study last year, which said 70 percent of hospitals would lose
money on Medicare patients by 2002, and the average margin would be
a negative 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials said the improved picture was due to Congress
giving hospitals about $8 billion in relief last year. But
hospitals need more, said Rick Pollack, executive vice president of
the American Hospital Association. ``Last year was not adequate,''
he said. ``We considered it to be pretty modest and a first step.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 cutbacks were supposed to save Medicare $116 billion
over five years. About $51 billion of that was to be cut from
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But as implemented, hospital officials say, the cuts are really
taking $79 billion from hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   While the government projects large budget surpluses in future
years, lawmakers may reject an appeal for money coming so soon
after last year's campaign. ``If it was uphill last year, it's up
an even steeper hill this year,'' said Ronald Hollander, president
of the Massachusetts Hospital Association.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals this year want:
</P>
<P>
   --A bigger annual inflation adjustment for Medicare payments.
The cumulative adjustment for the past three years has been 1.6
percent, which hospitals say is far below the increase in their
costs.
</P>
<P>
   --Relaxed rules for federal payments to hospitals that serve
large numbers of low-income and uninsured people.
</P>
<P>
   --Higher payments to teaching hospitals to cover the cost of
training doctors.

ANALYSIS: IN HAIDER CONTROVERSY, EU TAKES BIG STEP INTO POLITICAL
ARENA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Long a trade bloc with vague pretensions to be
something more, the European Union demonstrated its abrupt
development into a serious political force when it demanded that
Austria keep the party of Joerg Haider, a rightist politician, out
of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about Europe and its values,'' said Michael Steiner,
the chief diplomatic adviser to Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. ``We
cannot have business as usual with an Austrian government that
would allow the far-right to be legitimized.''
</P>
<P>
   Although one basic value _ ending war on the continent _ always
lay behind the slow process of European integration, this blunt
interference in a member state's national politics on essentially
moral grounds amounted to a radical departure, suggestive of an
embryonic European government.
</P>
<P>
   Austria reacted with contempt to the European Union's warning
Monday that diplomatic ties with a rightist government in Vienna
would be reduced to a ``technical level.'' Wolfgang Schuessel, the
leader of the conservative People's Party, who Tuesday night formed
a coalition government with Haider's Freedom Party, called the
European initiative ``a contradiction of the spirit of European
treaties.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in an unusual reversal of the pattern that usually sees
Europe following the United States on major diplomatic initiatives,
the Clinton administration said Tuesday it would ``consider similar
steps to those identified by the Europeans.'' This role reversal _
Europe leading Washington _ seemed to sum up an important shift.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1990s, Europe's energy was focused on introducing
a common currency, the euro. But with that project completed, and
with the experience of going to war in Kosovo to combat brutality
based on ethnic discrimination, Europe has awakened to its
political, military and moral identity.
</P>
<P>
   After the bloodiest century in Europe's history, the feeling is
strong that a man like Haider, who has spoken sympathetically of
Hitler and the Waffen SS _ however whimsically and with whatever
subsequent regret _ should have no part in what is now often called
``the new Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this newly discovered and powerful commitment to a Europe
free of the ethnic hatred and prejudice _ often distinguishing the
continent in the past _ that appears to lie behind the vehement
stand against Haider.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a shared currency and shared concerns about a
possible rightward shift on the continent driven by aging
populations and high unemployment have clearly pushed European
governments toward a more united and bolder stance than seemed
possible until recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the euro, which removed the sovereignty of member states
of the European Union in the financial area, we are moving swiftly
to the reduction of sovereignty in the political field,'' said
Dominique Moisi, a French foreign policy expert. ``That is clear in
the Haider initiative, made in Europe's name.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of course, this emergence in outline of a supranational European
state is alarming many people. Britain has resisted the euro
precisely because of the implications for its sovereignty and,
while supporting the European warning to Vienna, the government of
Tony Blair said ``the domestic political situation is for the
Austrians to resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marie Le Pen, the French rightist leader, put the problems
of the European position as succinctly as anyone: ``Mr. Haider
democratically won almost 30 percent of the vote, and, according to
elementary rules of democracy, he should be able to take part in a
coalition government.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is precisely in the name of ``democratic values'' that
the European Union has intervened, with the broad support of the
continent's press and a seeming majority of its population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe has values _ democracy, the rejection of racism and
totalitarianism, the respect of human rights,'' Massimo D'Alema,
the Italian prime minister, said Tuesday. ``These standards and
values forge unity. If these are put in doubt, Europe has the right
to state its views.''
</P>
<P>
   The French prime minister, Lionel Jospin, expressed a similar
idea, telling parliament Tuesday, ``The ideas of the Freedom Party
are contradictory to the principles on which the European Union was
founded.''
</P>
<P>
   Under its treaties, the European Union can suspend any member
found to be ``in serious and persistent breach'' of fundamental
principles. That is not the case in Austria, as the executive
commission of the European Union conceded Tuesday. The warning
issued Monday was therefore a coordinated measure among
member-state governments, rather than an action under the terms of
a European treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was made because the political reality of Europe is
such that the arrival of the Freedom Party in power in Austria is
regarded with grave concern.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democratic Union, the main conservative party of
Europe's most powerful state, Germany, is in a state of severe
disarray as a result of a funding scandal, prompting fears that
voters will migrate to rightist parties.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials said it was Germany that began the push for a
concerted European position last Saturday when Antonio Guterres,
the Portuguese prime minister and current president of the European
Union, lunched privately with Schroeder in the chancellor's home
town of Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder suggested to Guterres that a Europe-wide initiative
was imperative because the European Union could not be seen at this
delicate moment to be opening the door to what one German official
called ``an extreme, right-wing, nationalist, intolerant and
anti-immigrant party.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Europe, so often slow to react diplomatically, as in
Bosnia, decided for the first time to try to act preemptively,
making clear to Schuessel that the costs of forming a government
with the Freedom Party would be high.
</P>
<P>
   Its action contrasted with the European Union's silence when an
Italian post-Fascist party, the National Alliance, entered the
Italian government in 1994. At that time, Europe's primary concern
was still the economic integration symbolized by the euro.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the National Alliance, Alessandra Mussolini, the
granddaughter of the Duce, said Tuesday that the European
initiative in Austria was unacceptable because it meant that ``the
outcome of a democratic vote is being trampled.''
</P>
<P>
   But Germany, with experience of the horrors that democracy can
usher in, is in no mood to be swayed by such arguments. ``If we
make it clear that we want nothing to do with politicians like
Haider, that is not interfering in another country's affairs,''
Schroeder said Tuesday. ``It is an expression that we stand for a
Europe based on values and that Haider has constantly violated
those values.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, however, that the European Union has ``interfered''
in Austria's affairs on the basis of its new political and moral
pretensions, rather than on any firm legal footing. This reality
will not escape Austrians, who may now indignantly increase their
support for Haider.

STUDY CITES HIGH RISK OF ORAL TRANSMISSION OF AIDS VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The risk of transmitting the AIDS virus through oral sex is
higher than experts previously thought, according to a
government-funded study.
</P>
<P>
   About eight percent of a group of 102 gay and bisexual men
acquired the human immunodeficiency virus through oral-genital
contact, researchers found _ four to eight times higher than many
scientists believed. Moreover, that's probably an underestimate of
the real risk, one federal health official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that eight percent number caught a lot of people by
surprise,'' Dr. Ronald Valdiserri of the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention said in an interview. ``A substantial
minority of newly infected men were infected by this route.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're surprised but not shocked,'' said Jeff Jacobs of AIDS
Action, a Washington lobbying group, who added: ``I think this will
be news in the AIDS community, and I think it should be news in the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   While earlier research reports had suggested that HIV
transmission was possible during oral sex, the new study is the
strongest evidence thus far that it actually occurs at a
significant rate, at least among gay and bisexual men. There is no
reason, Valdiserri added, that women who engage in oral sex with
HIV-infected men are not also at significant risk.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the findings have public health significance for
teenagers and young adults of both sexes who are becoming sexually
active, who may have assumed that oral sex poses no risk of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not just gay men have oral sex,'' Valdiserri said. ``We need
to be sure that young people, many of whom practice oral sex as an
alternative to vaginal sex, need to understand there's a risk
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Oral transmission of HIV does not require that a person have
noticeable open sores or bleeding gums, the CDC official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The virus is found not just in semen but in preejaculate,''
Valdiserri said. ``And someone need not have grossly bleeding gums.
Tiny nicks and abrasions probably could give a portal of entry to
the virus.''
</P>
<P>
   AIDS authorities are worried that more HIV infections are
occuring through oral sex because of the widespread belief that it
is safe, while unprotected anal or vaginal sex is not. In fact,
some AIDS organizations in Massachusetts and elsewhere have
encouraged people to switch to oral sex to lower their risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sigh of relief when people saw that,'' said
Christopher Broughton of Boston, a gay community activist. ``The
intent was not to make people feel that `slipping up' with oral sex
was the same as `slipping up' with anal sex. The fear was that
people might say, `If I slipped up with oral sex, screw it, I might
as well go the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   The new findings are causing federal health officials to rethink
their AIDS prevention messages, CDC officials said. For one thing,
the study reinforces the need for people in committed relationships
to know if either is infected so they can know if it's safe to
engage in oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have told gay men that oral sex carries a risk but it's
much smaller,'' Valdiserri said. ``This study shows that many men
have heard the message as `Oral sex is safe.' But just because an
activity is low risk doesn't mean it's no-risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was carried out in San Francisco by the CDC's Dr. Beth
Dillion in collaboration with researchers at the University of
California. They used a relatively new HIV testing method that
makes it possible to determine if an individual has been recently
infected _ an important factor when researchers are trying to
determine how someone became infected.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers interviewed the study subjects in unusual depth,
they said, and excluded any from the ``oral sex'' category if they
could have any any other exposure. For instance, two men disclaimed
any other activity, but said they had passed out from drug or
alcohol use during occasions when they might have been infected, so
could not be sure they had not been passive partners in anal
intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS specialists and community activitists said the new findings
would sow dismay among gay and bisexual men, in particular, who
have largely limited unprotected anal sex in response to AIDS, at
least in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some people will be very upset and some will be
angry,'' said Dr. Kenneth Mayer of Brown University. ``They were
comforted by the previous epidemiology that looked like the virus
was not easily transmitted through oral sex. People translated that
as: Not possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mayer, who reported more than a decade ago on individual
cases of oral-genital HIV transmission, added that ``the
epidemiology and biology still say this is far less risky than anal
sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a person `slips' one time and has oral exposure to
ejaculate, that one exposure is probably a very low-risk event,''
Mayer added. ``But if one says, `I'm only going to have oral sex
and I won't pay attention to the HIV status of my partner,' and
then has lots of partners, I think this study suggests that can be
a risky strategy.''

LEONARDO DREW EXTRACTS SCULPTURAL METAPHORS FROM LIFE'S DETRITUS 
</HEADLINE>

(DW) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Visitors to Leonardo Drew's studio in Brooklyn should
be prepared to stand; there is simply no place to sit. His
sculptures, in varying states of completion, cover the floor and
the walls. Others lean against mounds of his raw materials _
half-open bales of cotton, containers of screws, paper, fabric
remnants and just plain junk. Wood _ in blocks, in sheets, in
little square boxes _ is everywhere. Here and there is a tool _ a
blowtorch, a table saw. Nearly everything is tinged with rust.
</P>
<P>
   There is no point sitting, in any case. As he talks about his
art, Drew seems to be everywhere. Tall and thin, he starts out
crouched on the floor, his knees pulled to his chest and his arms
around them; soon, to illustrate what he is saying, he is jumping
from one part of the studio to another, as if he were a 5-year-old
showing off the wonders of his playground. He wears work boots, a
black shirt, black sweat pants and a black scarf tied around his
head that trails down his back. His eyes are as outsize as his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   For all his enthusiasm, Drew will not say much about the meaning
of his work, mostly large, mixed-media abstract wall hangings and
sculptures that look a bit like urban ruins. He wants them to speak
for themselves. Though he will say that he canvasses city streets,
trash heaps and thrift shops to find the objects he uses, he
declines to describe exactly how he ages his materials to achieve
his trademark look. (``It's a secret process,'' he said. ``And it
has changed.'')
</P>
<P>
   Others, however _ critics, curators, collectors _ are eager to
fill the vacuum. Citing common elements like raw cotton, canvas
bags, rope and urban detritus in the sculptures, they say that Drew
is dealing with the emotional experiences of black Americans like
himself, first as slaves and then as members of an underclass. They
say that in forcing his materials to decay, subjecting them to heat
and soaking them in rusty water, he is commenting on life, death
and rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   As artistic inspirations, they mention Jackson Pollock, who
pioneered overall composition, or works that lack a single focus;
Eva Hesse, who often used rope; Louise Nevelson, who structured
many works as wooden grids; and Joseph Cornell, who processed wood
boxes to look decayed.
</P>
<P>
   In today's diffuse art world, Drew, 38, does not fit easily into
any school. But he has many fans, including the choreographer Merce
Cunningham, who asked Drew to collaborate on a 1995 piece, ``Ground
Level Overlay,'' for which he made a huge, black tapestry of rope.
Hard as it is to understand in his junk-crammed studio in
Williamsburg, the main complaint of his detractors is that his work
is a bit too decorative.
</P>
<P>
   Drew, whose sculptures fetch $10,000 to $40,000 at Mary Boone
Gallery in Manhattan, has works in the permanent collections of the
St. Louis Art Museum, which owns one of his favorites, ``No. 43,''
a 24-foot-long sculpture consisting of 160 wooden boxes filled with
bits of wood, cotton, nails, rags and rope; the Metropolitan Museum
of Art, which last year was promised ``No. 24,'' a 20-foot-long
piece; and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, whose ``No. 52'' is on
view in Bilbao, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   He has had solo shows at such institutions as the Museum of
Contemporary Art in San Diego and the Madison Art Center in
Wisconsin, which is showing a large commissioned work and two dozen
accompanying drawings through Feb. 13, when the show begins a
national tour. Next up is an exhibition of a new three-part work at
the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington on March 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``His work has all these intricacies,'' said Teresia Bush, a
senior educator at the Hirshhorn who organized the show. ``It gets
in touch with a person's inner self because when you try to analyze
it, you end up analyzing yourself.'' From the moment Bush saw
Drew's work in 1995, she said, ``something about it pulled me over
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Drew tells it, his methods are similarly intuitive. He
imbibes his daily experiences and when he starts working, they
resurface as art. ``The eye takes in some information, the body
takes in some more,'' he said. ``That information will be
revealed.''
</P>
<P>
   He takes no notes, no photographs, and he makes no studies or
sketches. ``That would take away the spontaneity,'' he said. (He
made the sketches on view in Madison after making the sculpture.)
</P>
<P>
   Born in Tallahassee, Fla., in 1961, Drew grew up in a housing
project in Bridgeport, Conn., with his mother and four brothers. He
found his calling early. As a youngster, ``I drew on everything,''
he recalled. ``Even on a test paper, I turned it over and drew. I
did second grade two times because all I wanted to do was draw.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, he said, he had a breakthrough. ``I was in
Catholic school, and the nuns said they'd put me into sixth grade,
but if I didn't do well I'd go back to fifth grade.'' So, he
continued, ``I spoke to God, or whatever. I decided to put more
effort into sixth grade, and I got all A's. Then I started
exhibiting.''
</P>
<P>
   At 13, Drew had his first solo show, at the State National Bank
in Bridgeport. Recalling his paintings of subjects like swans and
clouds, he says it was ``hilarious.''
</P>
<P>
   He kept at it, had a few more local shows, learned art history
and took inspiration from other artists, especially Pollock. He
studied art at the Parsons School of Design and earned a bachelor's
degree in fine arts from the Cooper Union in 1985. By then, he
said, he realized that his skill at drawing and painting was a
crutch.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped painting and started making sculptures, experimenting
with many materials. He wasn't happy with the results until 1988,
when he made ``No. 8,'' a black melange of coiled rope, animal
skulls, wood, rags and pelts that he believed achieved the energy
of a Pollock. In it critics saw references to bondage, lynching,
pain and death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art is made in peaks and valleys, and I peaked at `No. 8' and
at `No. 14' _ that's when the rust started coming on _ and at `No.
43,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Drew said he works constantly and, unlike many artists, never
uses assistants. ``My work and my self are not separate,'' he said.
``They are the same thing. My days are 16- to 18-hour days; big
days are 20-hour days, with four hours of sleep in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Reality intrudes: where could he possibly sleep? Drew related a
tidbit: ``When I lived in Washington Heights, I slept in the
bathtub because my work took up so much space.'' (Nowadays Drew
sleeps in a room adjoining his studio.)
</P>
<P>
   His art often begins when he searches for materials on the
street. ``I push my grocery cart out there and it's like shopping.
When I lived in Manhattan I was all over Manhattan. They should
give me a citation for cleaning up.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But he goes to stores for materials, too. ``They look found, but
they only echo found,'' he said. ``You can become the weather, you
can put things in the process of aging.''
</P>
<P>
   For that Drew uses various combinations of heat, sun, water and
other natural elements. He also shreds some materials, knots
others, paints them, builds wood into boxes and manipulates shape
and color in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   All along he is trying to figure out how to forge the materials
into metaphors. He points to ``No. 8,'' one of the few works he
still owns. ``All those objects speak to one another,'' he said.
``A wood circle got painted and put in a box; the fabric is
store-bought, not found; the paper is shredded.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew said his ideas came from life's experiences, starting with
his own and more recently, collective human history. ``The weight
of my ancestry still continues in my work, but there are other
issues now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Each sculpture starts on the floor with a grid of some sort,
white squares, for instance. He works on one section at a time, and
as he does he keeps a television set (also drenched in rust-hued
dust) going in the background. ``I always have something on,'' he
said. ``It charges me. It gives me the sense that I'm connected to
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   As befits a scavenger, he often recycles his own work. The
wooden boxes that went into ``No. 43'' were used years earlier in
another piece. Another sculpture had three or four lives. ``I never
leave things in the studio because if it's around and I need it,
it'll get used,'' Drew said. ``Mary made that mistake once; she
called and wanted a piece to sell and it had been taken apart and
used in another piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, when he was working in his Manhattan apartment, he made a
sculpture that was too big to get out the door. ``I had to cut it
up, and the piece became reborn,'' he chuckled. These days, in
addition to his 3,000-square-foot studio in Brooklyn, Drew works
part of the year in San Antonio, where he has several times more
room.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years his work has changed, sometimes subtly, and he
attributes that to a widening of his world. A 1992 trip to Dakar,
Senegal, where he viewed quarters where slaves were held before
being shipped to America, prompted him to incorporate small boxes
into his work, for example. ``They're claustrophobic,'' he said, a
feeling he could not escape in Senegal.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Drew spent time in Brazil, where he was shocked by
the poverty. ``Visually it was horrific,'' he said. ``There were
cardboard houses, people were washing their clothes in the sewers.
I knew poverty, but not at the level I saw in Brazil. The human
suffering I saw will influence my work; I have no idea how.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he believes he must travel because it informs and deepens
his work. ``It's necessary for me to have different experiences,''
he said. ``The more I see, the more apt to change I will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer Drew felt that his work was about to shift. ``I'm
getting close to something,'' he said then. His piece for the
Hirshhorn will be more colorful and more random than his previous
work, said Bush, the curator, adding, ``You'll recognize it as
Leonardo's, but it's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks before the opening, Drew was scrambling to finish his
work for the show. ``It's a culmination of the last three and a
half years,'' he said by telephone from San Antonio, adding that he
was using pink, silver and other colors. ``It's more aggressive,
it's alive with color. It's exciting for me because it's new.''
</P>
<P>
   A nagging question remained. ``Yes,'' Drew replied, ``I was
named after Leonardo da Vinci. My mother says it just had to be,
but I try not to place much on it. I didn't know who Leonardo was
until the fourth grade, when the nuns told me. I used to get beat
up for my name. I didn't answer to it in first grade. I accept it
now, gratefully.''

MARKET PLACE: CMS' GLOBAL LOVE AFFAIR APPEARS OVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Having almost gone broke in the 1980s back home in
Michigan, CMS Energy _ the parent of Consumers' Power _ wowed Wall
Street in the 1990s by going global and expanding into almost every
part of the energy industry.
</P>
<P>
   But that love affair appears to be over, or at least
experiencing a crisis. Facing heavy debts and weaker profits from
international operations than expected, CMS on Tuesday disclosed a
financial restructuring plan. That plan will slash dividend
payments while raising cash by selling tracking stock tied to its
old-fashioned utility business back in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted with anger, and the company's share price fell
to a four-year low as it dropped $6.50 to $23.50 _ a figure that is
less than half the peak reached in late 1998, when Wall Street was
most impressed by the international diversification efforts.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong? Some things were beyond the company's control,
most notably rising interest rates, which cut deep because much of
the growth had been financed with borrowed money. But the company
also has failed to produce the overseas profits it forecast, and it
has zig-zagged regarding its financing strategy. Combined, the
developments raise questions about management's ability to run, and
to monitor, the vast operations it has acquired in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest disappointment came from earnings that were well
below what the company had led Wall Street to expect. The company,
which on Monday reported profits of $2.89 a share for 1999, had led
analysts to expect about $3.30 in 2000. Now it is forecasting
$2.50, before some special factors, a figure that it forecasts will
grow by 10 percent or more in 2001 and by 12 percent or more in
2002. The lower forecast reflects, among other things, reduced
expectations for electricity-generating plants in Argentina and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very confident about our earnings forecasts going
forward,'' said William T. McCormick, the company's chairman and
chief executive, in a telephone interview. He voiced confidence
that the stock would soon rebound.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts Tuesday morning before
trading began, McCormick said that he valued the local gas and
electric utility in Michigan at about $25 a share, given the
current share prices of other utilities.
</P>
<P>
   If that analysis is correct, it would appear that the rest of
the company is now deemed to be worthless, with the stock price
below $25. Certainly the stock appears to be cheap, selling at less
than ten times the company's earnings forecast for this year.
</P>
<P>
   In part, that appears to reflect a lack of confidence in the
company's forecasts. Not only have earning forecasts come down, but
only last fall the company was talking about selling enough assets
to avoid having to issue more stock. Now it is planning to raise
$600 million by selling tracking stock in the electric utility.
</P>
<P>
   That stock would represent a 20 percent stake in the utility,
and would be priced to produce a dividend yield of 6.5 percent to
7.5 percent, McCormick said. The regular CMS stock will see its
annual dividend cut to 40 cents a share from $1.46. Investors
interested in dividends will be given the opportunity to exchange
CMS shares for the new utility tracking shares. Like other tracking
shares, they would be designed to trade like common stock of the
subsidiary, but would represent an ownership stake in the entire
company.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick had been hailed for rescuing CMS from the verge of
bankruptcy after it built a $4 billion nuclear plant in Midland,
Mich., that never opened. He managed to convert that into a gas
congeneration plant and he expanded the company into such fields as
interstate gas pipelines and oil exploration. It now has operations
in 21 countries, including India, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates
and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   But along the way, the debt level _ already high as a result of
the cost of building the nuclear plant _ rose as more and more
acquisitions were made. Last year, the company delayed selling
stock after spending $2.2 billion to buy gas pipelines from Duke
Energy. That left it with an even heavier debt load as interest
rates rose last year.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan calls for the $600 million raised from selling the
tracking stock to be used to pay down debt. ``That will permanently
fix our balance sheet,'' McCormick said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If McCormick's latest profit forecasts are accurate, then his
forecast that the stock will rebound are likely to come true. But
it may take some time for investors to regain their confidence in
the company.

   An old classmate of mine, who went on to become a Latin American
finance minister, once brought his technical experts to a meeting
with a U.S. Treasury official. The official was furious. ``Get your
(expletive) numbers guys out of here,'' he yelled _ which was how
the U.S.-educated technical team subsequently referred to
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is by way of apology for this column, in which I am
going to be, at least a bit, a numbers guy. But then my subject is
a numbers issue: how big a tax cut can a presidential candidate
responsibly offer?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it depends on what the candidate plans to do about
spending. Big tax cuts won't break the budget if they go along
with, say, significant reductions in Social Security and Medicare
benefits. But the truth _ or at least the conventional wisdom _ is
that post-Clintonian America has reached a sort of equilibrium, in
which the median voter wants a government that is neither much
bigger nor much smaller than it currently is. And assuming that it
is a Bush-Gore election (despite Tuesday night's results), both
candidates will at least pretend to respect that equilibrium. How
much money does that leave on the table?
</P>
<P>
   If you have been reading the headlines, you probably think that
the answer is, quite a lot. After all, didn't the Congressional
Budget Office just estimate that thanks to our booming economy the
federal government will run a surplus over the next decade of $1.9
trillion? And doesn't this mean that the budget can easily
accommodate even the $1.3 trillion in tax cuts being proposed by
George W. Bush?
</P>
<P>
   No. To see why, you have to look at the, um, numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The key question is, What would it mean to keep the size of
government about the same as it currently is? A reasonable man _
and Bush's economists are, as I said last week, reasonable men _
might guess that it means keeping ``real discretionary spending per
person'' more or less constant. Note the modifiers.
``Discretionary,'' meaning that nobody is proposing to scale back
the big-ticket entitlement programs; ``real,'' because if prices
rise it costs more to provide the same services; ``per person,''
because more people means more need for government services, which
is why a populous state like _ to take a random example _ Texas has
a bigger budget than its less populous neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, that $1.9 trillion estimate was not based on anything like
this reasonable notion. It was based on the assumption that total
spending on discretionary programs will remain constant _ in
ordinary, non-inflation-adjusted dollars _ for the next 10 years.
Since the projection also assumes roughly 2 percent inflation, this
means a large reduction in real spending. And since the population
is going to grow over time, it means an even bigger cut in real
spending per person. In other words, that big surplus number is
based on the assumption of a drastic, even draconian reduction in
government services.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, the CBO also offered a more realistic projection
based on the assumption that discretionary spending grows with
inflation. That simple adjustment lops off more than a trillion
dollars. But because the population is growing, that still means a
substantial decline in per capita spending _ and since some
programs cannot or will not be cut, it means deep cuts in what
remains.
</P>
<P>
   How much is really on the table? I've done my own
back-of-the-spreadsheet calculation of how the CBO's surplus
projection would change if real spending grew with population; the
adjustment brings the total down to around $400 billion.
</P>
<P>
   So how can those reasonable men advising George Bush think that
he can offer $1.3 trillion in tax cuts? Assuming that they are
neither planning to raid Social Security nor counting on favorable
revenue surprises to save them (unfavorable surprises are, of
course, out of the question), they must have in mind a sharp
scaling back of government programs.
</P>
<P>
   But that, of course, is not at all what the candidate's rhetoric
suggests. He seems to be saying that he only wants to stop those
Washington politicians from initiating grandiose new spending
schemes. There is little hint that his ``compassionate
conservatism'' can be financed only if the government sharply cuts
back on what it is doing now.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask me, it's time he had a little chat with his numbers
guys.

 EDITORS: RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT 
 
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ It's a scene straight out of the Old West.
</P>
<P>
   A young mother looks out over the barren high desert, her three
small children huddled behind her skirts. Horses graze out front as
a wagon rolls by.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Hull, you're not in Kansas anymore.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Arizona's present governor was a 26-year-old
schoolteacher who left a comfortable Kansas City suburb and moved
to Chinle, a remote town on the Navajo Reservation in northern
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real culture shock,'' Hull recalled. ``We were there
in the days when the wagons pulled up for commodities at the
boarding school.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Terry, a doctor, had been assigned to Chinle by the
U.S. Public Health Service.
</P>
<P>
   There was no theater, no library; only a few trading posts.
There was no supermarket, so Hull did her shopping in Albuquerque,
planning family meals six weeks at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first year, there was no TV . . . we had to make our own
fun,'' Hull said. ``We had more time to really enjoy each other, I
think, than I ever had, before or since.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull's time in Chinle offers a striking image of the governor as
a gritty frontier woman. But it doesn't square with the portrait
being painted by some detractors in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, they say that Hull is out of touch and over her head,
and being led around by her staff. As evidence, they point to an
excessive number of vetoes (21) last session and a breakdown in
communication with the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   As Hull, 64, begins her third year as governor, lawmakers are
grumbling that the real power is held by Hull's chief of staff,
Rick Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she got sick last year . . . you saw a change,'' said
state Rep. Sue Gerard, R-north central Phoenix. ``Rick did gain
more power, and she did become more isolated. It became harder for
us to talk to her independent of Rick.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the capitol, the whispers have started. Has the Iron Lady
started to rust?
</P>
<P>
   Hull and her staff laugh off such claims. She says Collins takes
most of the flak, because that's his role as chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually too involved in too many things,'' Hull said. ``I
micromanage around here more than we would like. Everybody blames
it on Rick. It's me.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the office, Hull doesn't stand on ceremony. She sometimes
answers her own phone and gets her own coffee and is still
embarrassed when staff members rise when she enters a room.
</P>
<P>
   She's not much of a public speaker, actually more of a public
reader, as evidenced by her recent State of the State speech, which
was described by one catty observer as ``almost lifelike.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that Hull was speaking to a somewhat hostile
Legislature, including people who want to teach gun safety in
public schools, but don't care whether kids fall out of the back of
pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hull tried to entertain them a little, with a tame joke
or two. The speech's solitary attempt at statesmanship _ a Latin
phrase _ fell flat when Hull mangled it.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the spotlight, Hull is quick-witted and engaging. She
reminds one of former Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole,
whose singular wit never translated in big rooms.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Hull met with the media after her state
address, she ribbed one reporter for appearing to sleep through the
speech. &QL; 
A parent's patience Hull also exhibits the patience of someone who
has raised four children and taught thousands more. After 21 years
in public office, she boasts, ``I usually can get along with
everybody and anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor gently notes that she has turned the emphasis back
to helping people. She's proud of programs such as KidsCare, which
provides health insurance for the children of the working poor, and
Students FIRST, a plan to fix dilapidated school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   And Hull has another advantage over her predecessor, Fife
Symington. Her staff members aren't preoccupied with keeping their
boss out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   As for her dust-ups with the Legislature and House Speaker Jeff
Groscost, R-Mesa, Hull is puzzled. She spent 14 years in the House,
including two terms as speaker, so she knows how the Legislature
works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a problem understanding why they just don't pick up the
phone and call me, at night or at home or whatever,'' Hull said.
``Because I've known a lot of them for a long time. And some of
them have said, `But you understand, you're now the governor, and
we can't do that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Hull remains immersed in affairs of state,
attending meetings, taking work home, even e-mailing staffers in
the wee hours of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``She does her homework,'' said Collins, waving a handful of
bureaucratic minutiae that Hull will inevitably want to see. ``I
guess that's the schoolteacher in her.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, both the governor and Collins acknowledge that Hull's
hospital stay in March started tongues wagging. Was Hull gravely
ill? Could she still govern? Would she serve out her term?
</P>
<P>
   The illness gave an opening to Hull's enemies to undermine her
in a way that goes far beyond making fun of the governor's big hair
or knocking her for talking about curlers.
</P>
<P>
   It got so bad that at one point, Collins was denying rumors that
Hull had a fatal liver disease.
</P>
<P>
   Hull admits she is sick _ sick of hearing about the issue. To
muzzle the gossip, Hull granted a reporter an interview with her
physician, Dr. Anita Murcko.
</P>
<P>
   Murcko said Hull was hospitalized with a serious kidney
infection. It started in the urinary tract and reached Hull's
bloodstream, but it did not advance to the more serious condition
of toxic shock.
</P>
<P>
   In typical Hull fashion, she tried not to create a fuss, walking
the short distance from her doctor's office to Good Samaritan
Regional Medical Center in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked over because she didn't want to alarm her security
guards,'' Murcko said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull was treated with intravenous antibiotics and suffers no
lasting effects. She takes medication for arthritis and a thyroid
condition, and Murcko describes her as very healthy.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rumors, Hull cracked, ``I keep saying they're jealous
because I've lost weight.''
</P>
<P>
   They also might be jealous of Hull's knack for always being in
the right place at the right time. Hull never has to run that hard.
The ball always comes right to her.
</P>
<P>
   She's the Silver Surfer of Arizona politics, riding a wave of
serendipity to the top of state government.
</P>
<P>
   Elected to the House in 1979, Hull made headlines in 1982 by
suggesting that the state could save money by allowing the swamp
coolers at the Perryville prison to fall into disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the swamp coolers will break down,'' she said. ``That
might get rid of some of our prison population.''
</P>
<P>
   As majority whip in 1987-88, Hull became the de facto majority
leader, filling in for an ailing Jim Ratliff. In 1989, she landed
in the speaker's chair after Joe Lane was ousted by voters angry
over Lane's role in the impeachment of former Gov. Evan Mecham.
</P>
<P>
   Hull was known as a no-nonsense speaker who kept her fellow
Republicans in line, never hesitating to bonk a fews heads if need
be. While speaker, she earned two nicknames _ ``Iron Lady'' from
her supporters and ``Dragon Lady'' from her enemies _ and weathered
the AzScam public corruption scandal, which led to criminal charges
against several legislators.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Hull inherited the Governor's Office from Symington,
who was forced out after being convicted of bank fraud. Symington's
conviction has since been overturned. Hull ran for re-election in
1998 and won by a wide margin. &QL; 
Shaky public relations
</P>
<P>
   Despite her long experience in state government, Hull is off to
a shaky start, at least as far as public relations go.
</P>
<P>
   When news leaked last year that the state was ordering a
14-year-old to have an abortion, Hull appeared to waffle.
</P>
<P>
   First, she said there was little the state could do. But as
public pressure mounted, Hull reversed field, calling on state
Attorney General Janet Napolitano to appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Hull took a bum rap in that case, which would be
clear when the records are made public.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was going this path until a document was set down in front
of her face, from a psychiatrist, that was contradictory to the
route she was going,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull also got some bad press for her push to install cable
barriers on Valley freeways. After several people were killed in
head-on collisions, Hull told the state Department of
Transportation to study the barriers.
</P>
<P>
   After a friend, former state legislator Polly Getzwiller, was
seriously injured in a similar crash, Hull cut the study short and
ordered the department to install the barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Hull said her decision was not linked to the accident involving
Getzwiller.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a nice lady, and I know her . . . and some day we have
to find out if she's ever gotten out of the hospital,'' Hull said. &QL; 
Power struggleWhether Hull blows with the wind or not, one thing is
certain: She faces a Legislature that borders on insurrection. Some
lawmakers are upset because they didn't see Hull's vetoes coming
last session.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first I heard of it, a reporter called me,'' said Sen. Tom
Freestone, R-Mesa, an amiable ex-wrestler and fixture in Maricopa
County politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Guess what, Freestone. Your bill just got
slaughtered' . . . I was caught flat-footed.''
</P>
<P>
   Freestone, whose open-meetings bill should survive this session,
said he understands why legislators bristled at the vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like working through the whole season raising
crops, then you find out you had a tornado come through and destroy
everything,'' Freestone said.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, lawmakers may take the fight with Hull a step
further. In a move that smacks of bravado, they have hinted about a
``veto session'' _ reconvening to revive any bill struck down by
Hull.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about power, says Groscost, who believes Hull vetoed a
number of bills to re-establish control of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure some of it was aimed at making sure she sent a
message to legislators who disagreed with her,'' Groscost said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In her mind, she tried to show that she was in charge and in
fact people better listen to what she had to say.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Marc Spitzer, R-north-central Phoenix, said Hull had
good reasons behind her vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she vetoed bills for fun,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Hull says the vetoes were all about policy, not
payback. Most of them involved bills that called for spending
beyond the current budget, or bills that cut into the power of
state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Hull's disagreements have been with Groscost, who
clearly loves stirring the pot.
</P>
<P>
   Although they hail from the same party, Hull and Groscost
couldn't be more different. Hull is a member of the old guard, a
moderate, a grandmother and a Catholic. Groscost is a young turk, a
staunch conservative and a Mormon.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost sometimes sports the demeanor of a used car salesman,
but he's no dummy. He understands how to consolidate power and hold
it, and he lives for political gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Widening the rift, Hull chose to back Texas Gov. George W. Bush
for president, while Groscost and most other state Republicans are
pushing Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Some say Groscost has baited Hull at every turn. He invited
National Rifle Association President Charlton Heston to address the
House, despite the governor's moderate position on guns.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, he held a downtown fund-raiser featuring skits
lampooning Hull.
</P>
<P>
   In a tribute to understatement, Hull said she was
``disappointed'' in the fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you respect the governor or not, respect the office,''
Hull said. ``The fund-raiser and the singing, those things are not
a respect for the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull has also taken criticism for letting her various policy
experts lobby the Legislature, meaning her office doesn't speak
with one voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Problem is, all of her staff people are real technocrats . . .
they don't know politics,'' Gerard said. ``Because Rick (Collins)
is so authoritarian or totalitarian, they can come down and talk to
us, but they have no authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Last session, Gerard and Collins stopped playing nice and
started kicking sand in each other's faces.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the session, Gerard sent Collins a box of
chocolates as a make-up present. Collins sent it back. So there.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had accused me of not being truthful and questioning my
integrity . . . that's the kind of thing that happens in the heat
of battle,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little out of line in sending it back.''
</P>
<P>
   This session, Hull has taken steps to open the lines of
communication between her office and the Legislature, in part by
naming aide Jaime Molera as chief lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the governor smiles when legislators say they want a
return to the Symington administration, when one lobbyist, Barry
Aarons, did most of the governor's talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all want Barry Aarons back . . . every one of those
people had said, `Get Barry Aarons out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull admits she takes a different tack with lawmakers than
Symington did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like that style of having one person go down there and
twist their arms, twist their necks,'' Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull also ran into trouble with the Legislature during
December's special session to replace the dilapidated state mental
hospital. Hull called the session, only to watch her proposal die
in a committee. &QL; 
A new session
</P>
<P>
   But things improved when the regular session started. One of the
first acts was passage of a bill to provide $80 million for a new
state mental hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Hull's legislative troubles have to do with term limits
and the current leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In another environment, Senate President Brenda Burns,
R-Glendale, might be able to play peacemaker between Groscost and
Hull, but Burns has troubles of her own.
</P>
<P>
   For one, she faces the challenge of running the Senate with a
one-seat (16-14) Republican majority. On top of that, she may not
be able to hold on to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Due to term limits, Groscost must leave the House next year and
probably will run for the Senate, where he and pal Rusty Bowers, a
Republican senator from Mesa, could form a cabal to oust Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the hubbub, Hull probably will find a way to
survive, just as she did in Chinle years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Allen, a Navajo registered nurse who befriended the Hulls,
said there's just something about Jane.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be very resourceful to find things to do, and get
acquainted,'' Allen said. ``That's what Jane did . . . She was a
very easygoing person, very outgoing. She doesn't just sit back and
wait for people to come to her.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Hull will not write off the Legislature. She will not give
up. She'll crack her jokes, make her phone calls, do her homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing to me is that I leave a legacy that
says the state of Arizona is better for my five years of being
governor,'' Hull said. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several years ago, a success story at the John G. Shedd Aquarium
in Chicago came perilously close to morphing into a public
relations disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1930, Shedd could handle up to 9,000 visitors a day.
Then, in 1991, it opened an oceanarium that featured dolphin shows,
drawing new visitors. But the oceanarium could accommodate only
7,500 people, and on busy days guards had to turn away hundreds of
visitors, some of whom were angry after having driven for hours
with their children to see the shows.
</P>
<P>
   The overcrowding threatened to get worse if nothing was done
before Shedd finished two exhibitions to reproduce the environments
of the Amazon River and the Philippine coral reefs. Those additions
will also have limited space.
</P>
<P>
   For a solution, Shedd turned to one of the country's pre-eminent
strategic consulting firms, Bain &AMP; Co., which charges corporate
clients multimillion-dollar fees but, like its competitors, also
does work free for nonprofit organizations. Sure enough, by teasing
out patterns in a sea of details the aquarium had compiled on
visitors, from their ZIP codes to their ages and number of
children, Bain came up with a plan to persuade local groups to
visit on slow days.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, that achievement would have been soon
forgotten, just another good deed by a consulting firm with
corporate clients around the world who pay Bain an estimated $700
million annually for advice.
</P>
<P>
   But now, because of a project that was nine years in the making
and that was officially started four weeks ago, such sophisticated
advice forms the backbone of a new initiative by Bain.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, the Bridge Group, has close ties to Bain but is
a legally separate nonprofit organization. It has a staff of 12 of
the best and brightest consultants from Bain's ranks who have
committed themselves to stints at Bridge of six months to a year,
even though they have to take pay cuts ranging from 80 percent for
million-dollar-a-year Bain executives to 20 percent for junior
consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The Bridge Group is something entirely new in the world of
big-league business consulting _ a general-purpose strategic
consulting firm that will help other nonprofit organizations for a
fee.
</P>
<P>
   Its aim is to complement the piecemeal, pro bono approach that
Bain and others have long taken toward helping nonprofits solve
management and logistical woes. The group will offer the
consistent, sustained advice that has helped big business wring
more profit out of each invested dollar. It will also enhance the
quality of help now provided by a plethora of nonprofit
consultants, ranging from one-person shops to niche agencies,
mostly focused on fund-raising or management.
</P>
<P>
   It is, Bain consultants believe, a long overdue step. After all,
the United States has about 770,000 nonprofits, not counting
religious organizations, which last year took in an estimated $750
billion in fees, grants, donations and investment earnings. But
despite accounting for 8 percent of the economy, nonprofits get
little attention in the business pages or from big consulting firms
precisely because they are not in business to make investors rich.
</P>
<P>
   Many nonprofit experts expect a wave of consolidation among
nonprofits, just like the mergers that have swept through
corporations over the last decade, as organizations seek the scale
necessary for success in the 21st century. The creation of a
strategic consulting firm for nonprofits is likely to encourage
such a trend. For all its growth, however, the nonprofit sector is
highly fragmented, with many organizations too small to accomplish
much and many duplicating the works of other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There simply is no force to push consolidations and to move
organizations to an appropriate scale to fulfill their mission,''
said Thomas Tierney, Bain's worldwide managing director and father
of the idea for the Bridge Group.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, about half the growth in nonprofit revenue in the last
two decades came from fees charged for services that range from
counseling troubled families to renting out space in churches to
day-care providers. Donations accounted for only 8 percent of the
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Tierney's vision is not just to help individual nonprofits, but
to build a storehouse of knowledge that can be applied to common
problems among nonprofits in the same way that Bain can help a
ketchup maker improve profits by reviewing work it did for mustard
and pickle makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pro bono consulting for nonprofits often doesn't produce
results because it is in and out,'' Tierney said. ``They often have
no follow-up because the ugly fact is that, ultimately, you get
what you pay for.''
</P>
<P>
   Each project will include follow-up consultations so the
insights that Bridge Group consultants develop do not gather dust
on a shelf but are adopted and refined through practical
experience.

   The Bridge Group's consultants all have full access to the
wealth of knowledge that Bain has stored in its Bain Virtual
University, a database in which every corporate client's project is
reduced to a case study, called a ``knowledge module,'' so that the
wheel does not get invented over and over again. This gathering and
storing of information is a critical element in the efficiency and
profitability of big consulting firms.
</P>
<P>
   The Bridge Group, which has small offices in Boston and San
Francisco, will charge fees that will generally be only about
one-fifth what Bain charges for-profit corporate clients and in
many cases will be paid by foundations, said Jeffrey Bradach, a
former Harvard business professor who is the managing director of
the Bridge Group.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Bridge will handle perhaps 10 clients, one of them a
major foundation that Bradach declined to identify. ``The
presenting problem was that they give away tens of millions of
dollars a year but don't know what they really produce for that
money,'' Bradach said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The Bridge Group will analyze the donations, trying to show the
foundation how to get results that further its agenda. That kind of
insight into how grant-making can produce tangible results has been
the Holy Grail of nonprofit evaluators. Bradach says his staff has
the expertise to apply strategic consulting, over time, to improve
the effect of grants.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Bridge Group began with an idea sketched on the back of
napkins at a Mexican restaurant in Silicon Valley. Tierney and Paul
Carttar, another Bain consultant, were reviewing what they had
learned from work for various charities in the San Francisco Bay
Area, including the San Francisco United Way, and were bemoaning
the lack of a vehicle to apply what they had learned to other
nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because these were pro bono projects there was no knowledge
capture,'' Tierney said, using consultant jargon to explain that
valuable insights were not reduced to case studies and stored for
use by other consultants on future projects.
</P>
<P>
   As the two men looked at the stack of napkins covered with
notes, Tierney recalled, he told Carttar: ``Gosh, there has got to
be a way to do this in a sustainable manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later, when Tierney first sketched his idea for a
reporter, it did not have a name. But soon two teams from Bain
began working on the idea and, after 18 drafts of a business plan,
they came up with a low-cost model built around highly motivated
consultants working at low pay for fixed periods.
</P>
<P>
   Bain made a $1.3 million grant for the project and then Tierney,
Carttar and Bradach, the co-founders, went looking for outside
financing, securing a total of $5.5 million from the Edna McConnell
Clark, Rockefeller Brothers and Surdna foundations, all in New
York, and the Irvine Foundation in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Skloot, executive director of the Surdna Foundation,
which has a $650 million endowment, said the Bridge Group was a
critical step in improving nonprofit governance and management.
``We see value in developing knowledge that can be shared'' with
other nonprofits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Tierney, starting the Bridge Group is a chance to create a
legacy in the world of big-league consulting, an idea that could
transform nonprofit management.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can prove this model works, then someone else is going
to do it and we want that,'' he said. ``If one of the other big
consulting firms doesn't do this in the next few years, it would be
a mark against our idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The project has become his consuming passion. As he spoke, he
took a sheet from a legal pad and, without pausing in his remarks,
sketched a matrix comparing the Bridge Group model with the
existing system under which firms and nonprofit consulting agencies
both do cut-rate or free work for charities.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Tierney's jotting had grown into 28 boxes, an illustration
of how consultants take reams of information that can easily
overwhelm both corporate and nonprofit managers and reduce it to
its basic components, then devise ways to deal with those
components efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One question that Tierney and his co-founders say they
repeatedly encountered as they sought financing was: What does Bain
get out of this?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, its gets a relief valve for star consultants who
might otherwise leave to become chief executives at corporations
but now have the option of spending six months or more on socially
redeeming work instead of helping condiment makers squeeze more
profits out of their factories. Indeed, more than one-third of
Bain's 2,400 full-time professionals have volunteered to work at
the Bridge Group.
</P>
<P>
   Only the best will get the chance, Tierney said, and they will
``have to be very, very, very good.''
</P>
<P>
   So will the host of potential clients who have begun sending
proposals to the Bridge Group, which when fully staffed will be
able to handle about 40 a year. ``We must be very careful about who
are clients are,'' he said, ``because as consultants you can't be
any better than your client base.''

THE NEXT STOP: S.C. FAVORS BUSH BRAND OF REPUBLICANISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ For a few savory hours, Sen. John McCain will
know the elation of victory as he flies out of New Hampshire on
Tuesday night. But as soon as he lands at the airport here shortly
after midnight on Wednesday, he will find that Gov. George W. Bush
is already several laps ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is far more popular in South Carolina than in New
Hampshire, buoyed by the state's traditional affection for a
front-runner, the fondness for his family, and his own appeal to
religious conservatives. At the same time, McCain's brand of
personal politics, so effective when meeting Republican voters in
town meetings in New Hampshire, will be diluted in larger states
like this one, even though he plans to campaign virtually nonstop
until the Feb. 19 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's second-place showing in the New Hampshire presidential
primary on Tuesday will probably narrow the race in South Carolina
by blemishing his image as a certain winner, but just as South
Carolina turned back Pat Buchanan's strength in New Hampshire in
1992 and 1996, McCain will be forced to expend a formidable effort
to close the gap. A series of public opinion polls last month
showed Bush ahead by as many as 22 percentage points over McCain,
who has said this state is of ``transcendent importance'' to his
campaign. But although the surveys showed that McCain was reducing
the gap, particularly in retirement areas along the Atlantic coast,
it was hard to find anyone outside McCain's campaign who believed
he would be able to overcome it.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, for example, South Carolina's two biggest
Republican county organizations invited Bush's father to be the
principal speaker at a joint fund-raiser for the party. Although
county political organizations are supposed to be neutral during
presidential primaries, the event made it clear that neutrality is
a little old-fashioned this year.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush did not explicitly campaign for his
son while speaking at the gleaming BMW plant just outside town, but
he did not need to. The county leaders, and almost all of the 300
people who attended that evening, dispensed with the formality and
made it clear that the two counties were solidly for the Texas
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt about it, this is Bush country,'' said Richard
Beltram, chairman of the Republican Party in Spartanburg County,
which, along with neighboring Greenville County, usually accounts
for about a fourth of the state's turnout in Republican primaries.
``Upstate South Carolina is mainstream, conservative U.S.A., and
when Bush talks about being a compassionate conservative, that has
really struck a chord here.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not simply that Bush has more money, or that he has the
support of the state's political establishment that helped win the
primary for his father in 1988 and 1992, and for Bob Dole in 1996.
That establishment, embodied by such figures as former Gov. Carroll
Campbell, Sen. Strom Thurmond and state House Speaker David
Wilkins, has lost considerable influence, especially after it lost
the governorship in in 1998 to Jim Hodges, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush's popularity here is due in large part to almost
perfect-pitch resonance with the state's Republican electorate. He
possesses the two characteristics that have long appealed to voters
in the state's Republican primary: the perceived ability to beat a
Democrat, which is important to voters whose choice has become the
party nominee since 1980, and an unabashed Christian conservatism
that does not edge over into pietistic evangelism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans here want someone who is religiously and socially
conservative, but is not showy and glitzy about it, like a
televangelist,'' said David Woodard, the Clemson University
political science professor who directed the most recent poll of
primary voters. ``And they want someone who is a winner, who is in
tune with the mainstream of the Republican party. That's George
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most interesting aspects of the Clemson poll,
conducted among 650 people who had voted in earlier Republican
primaries, is the respondents' descriptions of the candidates.
While McCain was described as more hard-working than Bush, voters
said Bush was kinder and more religious than McCain, while also
providing stronger leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Being seen as more religious is vital in a state where, in
previous years, as many as 35 percent of voters have described
themselves as Christian conservatives in previous years,
particularly when neither of the top two candidates is considered a
fire-breather on abortion. (It helps explain why Bush has scheduled
a visit to the staunchly conservative Bob Jones University here
later this month.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, many social conservatives here were torn between
pragmatism and ideology, reluctantly supporting Dole over Buchanan
because their leaders told them Buchanan could not win nationally
and would reflect badly on the state. This year, the ambivalence
for the front-runner has vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bush said that his favorite philosopher was Jesus Christ,
well, that was just music to our ears,'' said Al Padgett, a
trucking company salesman who is co-chairman of the Christian
Coalition in Greenville County. ``Almost everyone I know is voting
for him. I wouldn't mind if he was a little stronger on pro-life
issues, but I think he's conservative enough for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Padgett said he doubted that many of the approximately 100,000
coalition members in the state would be voting for McCain, or, for
that matter, any of the minor candidates who are more full-throated
religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good guys, but we have to support a viable candidate
who can win,'' Padgett said. ``We just need to get a Republican in
the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has worked hard to portray himself as a conservative
here, loudly decrying the access to Internet pornography in the
Greenville Public Library, and running advertisements in which two
of his most popular supporters, Reps. Lindsey Graham and Mark
Sanford call him a conservative reformer akin to Ronald Reagan. He
has spent an estimated $1.7 million in the state, slightly more
than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Graham says that once voters get to know McCain better _ and he
will spend 15 of the next 19 days campaigning here _ the race will
quickly tighten.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to take a long look at his personal story and
realize that he has that Reagan-type appeal,'' Graham said. ``He's
got a much more traditional view than they might realize.''
</P>
<P>
   But many influential social conservatives, led by Pat Robertson,
the Christian broadcaster, have criticized McCain's keystone
campaign finance proposal because they believe it will reduce their
influence on the political system. And John Brausch, a retired
manufacturing executive who attended the county fund-raiser last
Thursday night, spoke for many voters when he said he preferred
Bush's more generous tax-cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about voting for McCain, but his tax cut isn't
deep enough,'' Brausch said. ``And I like Bush's stand on
pro-life.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is counting on independents and conservative Democrats to
vote in the Republican primary, which is open to everyone. (The
Democrats have canceled their March 9 primary and will be holding
only caucuses that day.)
</P>
<P>
   But the Clemson poll, which did a separate survey of
non-Republicans who plan to vote in the primary, found that Bush
leads even in that group, by 44 percent to 32 percent. It is those
voters whose minds McCain will spend the next three weeks trying to
change.

HEALTH AGENCY CRACKS DOWN ON GENE THERAPY RESEARCHERS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Pa., Calif., Tenn.)  (jw) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Officials at the National Institutes of Health admitted Tuesday
that they had failed to keep track of how patients fared during
gene therapy experiments and outlined steps to ensure that
scientists follow rules requiring them to report information about
harmful side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were receiving only a small number of adverse event reports
and we certainly should have recognized this as a sign of
underreporting,'' Dr. Ruth L. Kirschstein, the acting director,
wrote in a letter to a congressman. In an interview, another
institute official said, ``There is no excuse for it and it should
have been noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   The admission by Kirschstein, in a letter to Rep. Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., comes on the eve of a congressional inquiry into lapses
of federal oversight into gene therapy in general, and the death of
an 18-year-old patient in one experiment at the University of
Pennsylvania in particular.
</P>
<P>
   In an exchange of letters with Waxman, officials at the
institutes had acknowledged that of 691 serious side effects
experienced by patients in a particular type of gene therapy
experiments, only 39 were reported immediately, as required by the
agency. Only after an institute inquiry into the death were other
reports received. In a Jan. 10 letter, Waxman complained, ``This is
a failure rate of roughly 95 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   In her reply, Kirschstein said Tuesday that scientists might
have been confused about the reporting requirements.
``Nevertheless,'' she wrote, ''while this is an explanation for
inadequate reporting, it is not an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The admissions comes as authorities are closely examining the
10-year-old field of gene therapy. The effort stems largely from
the death of Jesse Gilsinger, a University of Pennsylvania patient,
who enrolled in a trial to test a treatment for an inherited enzyme
deficiency. He died after suffering an overwhelming immune reaction
to an infusion of corrective genes.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Food and Drug Administration shut down all gene
therapy experiments at the university.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., will convene a hearing
into the death. Gelsinger's father, Paul, will testify, as will
officials from the Food and Drug Administration and the health
institutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the oversight system is failing to prevent serious
violations of patient protection,'' Frist said Tuesday. ``Let's
have full transparency in the system.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, it has become clear that the system is not as
transparent as federal rules require. Typically, researchers
experimenting with drugs and therapies are monitored by the FDA,
which is required to keep all patient safety information a secret
so that companies are not at a competitive disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Gene therapy has always been an exception; because it is so
novel, it is also monitored by the health institute through a panel
of medical and ethics experts called the Recombinant DNA Advisory
Committee. The RAC, as the committee is known, conducts all its
work in public.
</P>
<P>
   Federal rules require that all serious side effects, whether or
not directly related to gene therapy, be disclosed immediately to
the institute. But even before Gelsinger's death, the advisory
committee's members had concerns that the requirements were not
being met. One company, Schering-Plough Corp., insisted that
information about gene therapy side effects be classified as a
proprietary trade secret, a position the company has since
rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   To force scientists to comply with the rules, Kirschstein said
the institute would begin inspections of institutions that
conducted gene therapy research, including records reviews. The
agency has also repeated its rules to all scientists conducting
gene therapy research, and as a backup, it is now receiving weekly
reports from the FDA about all side effects in gene therapy
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The move to force greater disclosure is likely to be met with
opposition from the biotechnology industry. Michael Werner, a
lawyer for the Biotechnology Industry Organization, a trade group,
said Tuesday that while companies wanted to comply with institute
rules, ``we are certainly concerned if the NIH is going to turn
this information over to the RAC, a public body.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as officials know, Gelsinger was the first person to die
as a direct result of participating in a gene therapy experiment.
Most patients in the experiments are already seriously ill, often
with cancer, and many die during the course of the research from
problems related to their diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger's case was unusual in that he was not particularly
sick; he suffered from a mild form of the enzyme deficiency. The
Pennsylvania experiment was designed to test the safety of a
treatment for babies with a fatal form of his disorder. It involved
an infusion of corrective genes, encased in a weakened cold virus,
adenovirus.
</P>
<P>
   The 691 reports gathered so far include side effects like high
fevers, serious infections and seizures, but the majority appeared
related to the patients' underlying diseases, according to an
institute official. But, the official said, it will be impossible
to determine if any patients have been harmed in gene therapy
research until the agency completes a review of the reports.
</P>
<P>
   The reports are from all studies that used adenovirus, which
account for only one quarter of all the gene therapy clinical
trials that have been conducted over the past decade. So it is
possible that there are many more reports outstanding; in an
interview Tuesday, Waxman said he was trying to press the institute
to obtain the additional information.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, it is unacceptable for the NIH not to
get this information out to the public,'' he said. ``We know of at
least one patient who has died for no reason and we are going to
make sure that as best we can we don't let this happen to anyone
else.''

AETNA TO RESTATE EARNINGS FOR 7 QUARTERS AT SEC'S REQUEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aetna, the nation's biggest health insurer, said Tuesday that it
was restating earnings for seven quarters of 1998 and 1999 at the
request of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission evidently did not object to accounting
arrangements that softened the impact on earnings after Aetna
bought Prudential Healthcare last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the announcement lifted one of several clouds that
had depressed Aetna stock, which declined almost 40 percent the
last 12 months. On the New York Stock Exchange, Aetna rose $3.375,
or more than 6 percent, to $56.625 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing a string of acquisitions and sales by Aetna
since 1996, the SEC asked the company to change its accounting for
the 1997 sale of its mental health managed care unit to Magellan
Health Services. The change will reduce after-tax earnings this
year by $39 million, or about 25 cents a share _ about 4 percent of
projected earnings per share.
</P>
<P>
   ``This removes one cloud, but there are others,'' said Joseph A.
France, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they were still waiting for signs of a turnaround
at the Prudential Healthcare unit, which was expected to lose $175
million in 1999, according to a company projection last fall. Joyce
Oberdorf, a spokeswoman for Aetna, said she could not disclose the
latest Prudential results before the company reports fourth-quarter
earnings next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna is also facing uncertainty over the eventual outcome of
several dozen lawsuits that have been filed by customers, doctors
and lawyers who specialize in class-action suits.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it had agreed to restate earnings for 1998 and
the first three quarters of 1999 to reflect a change in accounting
for the sale of its Human Affairs International unit to Magellan.
</P>
<P>
   Magellan agreed to pay up to $60 million annually for five years
to Aetna, if additional customers were shifted to the Human Affairs
unit at Magellan. Aetna was booking the $300 million total as
operating revenues but government regulators said it should be
recognized as a capital gain.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said net income would be reduced by approximately $10
million, or 7 cents a share, in the first and second quarters of
1999, and increased by $30 million, or 20 cents a share, in the
third quarter. ``There was no impact on total net income in 1998,''
the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SEC didn't find much of a problem in the way the
Prudential deal was being accounted for,'' said James A. Lane, an
analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   When Prudential Insurance Co. of America sold its health care
unit, the parent agreed to reinsure Aetna against certain expected
future losses. Prudential also paid Aetna $262 million in
administrative fees to compensate for money-losing contracts with a
number of self-insured employers.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna booked the premiums on the reinsurance as expenses, rather
than as a reduction in the $1 billion purchase price for Prudential
Healthcare. It reported the fees as operating income.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has required only minor changes in the accounting
related to Prudential, including an increase in some operating
earnings in the third quarter of 1999 and a decrease in the fourth
quarter, the company said. ``These changes are not projected to be
material to the company's future results,'' it added.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the company was also relieved that the SEC had not
required it to shorten the amortization period for good will it had
booked after its $8.9 billion purchase of U.S. Healthcare in 1996.
Doing so would have reduced annual earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is disquieting to have a company restate numbers, but this
was by no means the worst case scenario,'' said Roberta Walter
Goodman, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   She added that it would be difficult to assess any progress in
turning around Prudential Healthcare before the first quarter of
next year after Aetna's special arrangements with Prudential Life
end on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, analysts will lack solid comparisons with the earlier
performance of the Prudential unit. Its results were buried in the
reporting of its parent, Prudential Life, a mutual insurance
company that is not bound by the same rules as publicly traded
companies.

 &HT;    Georgia pulls its offer to recruit
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ The Georgia Bulldogs on Monday withdrew their
scholarship offer to Jason Respert, the top-ranked prep offensive
lineman in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Respert, who also lost Florida's offer Sunday after his felony
arrest during a weekend recruiting trip there, probably will sign
with Tennessee on Wednesday's national signing day.
</P>
<P>
   The high school All-American from Northside High School in
Warner Robins, was arrested Saturday and charged with attempted
sexual battery and burglary. The 18-year-old Respert was released
Sunday from the Alachua County Jail into his mother's custody on a
$50,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have discussed it with (football) Coach (Jim) Donnan, and he
feels we should not continue recruiting (Respert) under the
conditions as we understand them,'' Georgia athletics director
Vince Dooley said. ``(Donnan) expressed that to me, and I was
pleased, because I feel the same way. We will not be recruiting him
any further.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Dooley also said that Georgia would ``re-evaluate'' its
stance if the charges against Respert were dropped or proved to be
unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   But Respert probably would not be arraigned for four to five
weeks, according to the state attorney's office in Florida, and
then he would enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. His actual
court case could take much longer to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday is national signing day, but the period extends until
April 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know all the details, but there's enough that we do
know _ that is alleged _ that we believe this is a prudent stance
to take,'' Dooley said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida officials said Sunday and again Monday that they would
not be offering a grant-in-aid to the 6-foot-4, 301-pound Parade
Magazine All-American
</P>
<P>
   Respert could not be reached for comment on Monday. But Dawn
Sharp, who identified herself as a ``family friend,'' returned
telephone calls on the player's behalf. She said that Respert will
address the news media briefly at his house in Warner Robins at 7
a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason will read a statement about what his plans are and
address the charges,'' Sharp said.
</P>
<P>
   While Georgia and Florida backed off Respert, the Vols'
scholarship offer apparently still stands. Respert apparently is
going to take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still there,'' Sharp said about Tennessee's offer,
``waiting a response from Jason.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tennessee officials were guarded Monday in the
statements they made about Respert.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a situation the family has to deal with, and I don't
think it's appropriate to make any comments at this time,''
Tennessee AD Doug Dickey said.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee sports information director Bud Ford said, ``The only
statement we're making is that (Respert) is a recruiting prospect
who made an official visit on Jan. 14.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Kameg, public information officer with the Gainesville
Police Department, said Respert was with Florida football player
Alex Brown and recruit Tre Orr of Lake City, Fla. at 6:10 a.m.
Saturday at an apartment rented by a University of Florida woman.
</P>
<P>
   According to police reports, a man entered the woman's bedroom
while she was sleeping about 6:10 a.m. Saturday. The victim claims
the man removed the covers from her bed, lifted her shirt up, put
his hands down her pajama pants before she woke up. The victim
identified the man as Respert; she said that she did not know him.
He was arrested by Gainesville police Saturday afternoon at Florida
Field.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged victim attended Respert's bond hearing Sunday in
Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   Respert committed to Georgia during his Jan. 7-9 visit to
Athens. But after a visit to Tennessee the next weekend, he
reconsidered his decision and said it was ``50-50'' between the
Vols and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he said he was going to Florida ``just to be
certain'' of the decision he planned to make this week. He
apparently will make that decision public today.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of right now,'' Northside coach Conrad Nix said, ``he is
going to sign on Wednesday.''

 &HT;    Senior football players declare intentions today
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For months and in some cases years, they have been wooed,
called, written, visited, fed, housed and generally treated like
athletic royalty. Starting today, this year's crop of senior high
school football players must declare their intentions.
</P>
<P>
   College football's annual signing day is here for the national
letter of intent. More than 95 percent of the players will sign
before the sun sets.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech stands to sign its best class since signing day
caused such scrutiny; the Yellow Jackets should bring in five elite
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Tech entered signing day with a No. 9 national ranking,
according to a panel of recruiting analysts from across the
country, and a No. 4 ranking in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, on the other hand, might be a step and a half back from
some of the recruiting coups it has enjoyed over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs had a national ranking of No. 26 going into the
day, but it could improve dramatically if a few recruits decide on
the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs have verbal commitments from three elite seniors
but could pick up possibly two more during the first day of
signing.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Penn State seems to have the lead, but by just a
narrow margin over Florida, Penn State and Tennessee. Other top
recruiting crops seem to belong to Texas, Alabama, Texas, Nebraska,
Michigan State and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   A few schools have surpassed what had been expected. North
Carolina, for instance, who barely saved Carl Torborg's job and
finished 3-8 last year, is ranked 14th nationally. Other teams who
have been surprises include No. 30 ranked Maryland, Kentucky at No.
44, Duke at No. 49 and Northwestern at No. 50.
</P>
<P>
   The two schools that played for the college national
championship last year, Virginia Tech and Florida State, rank no
better than 21st and 22nd, respectively, but the Seminoles are
expected to charge late into the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs again did a good job inside the state. An even
dozen of its 18 commitments are from Georgia, and they could pick
up several others as the day wears on.
</P>
<P>
   Tech counts nine Georgians among its 20 commitments, but the
Jackets might be through, unless something unusual happens since
they had only 20 scholarships to give.

 &HT;    Hull is goal-oriented
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Nothing can top the emotion of winning the Stanley Cup.
Not even becoming only the 12th NHL player to score 600 goals.
</P>
<P>
   When Brett Hull reached that milestone just hours before Y2K, he
simply raised his stick skyward and allowed a grin to become a
smile, as Dallas Stars linemate Mike Modano skated toward him with
words of congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   The subdued reaction was in contrast to June's wild fist-pumping
celebration after Hull's controversial foot-in-the-crease goal gave
the Stars the Stanley Cup with a triple-overtime win over Buffalo
in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   Reach-
</P>
<P>
   hing 600 goals was a significant to Hull. But when it comes to
individual accomplishments, the real milestone is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   Hull _ stuck at 603 career goals going into tonight's game with
Atlanta _ needs seven more to tie his father, Bobby, for ninth on
the all-time NHL list.
</P>
<P>
   The son insists that catching and passing his father still won't
be as emotional as winning the Stanley Cup. But he might shed a
tear or two. The Hulls' relationship has run hot and cold, but
there has always been plenty of feeling on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Will Bobby Hull be there when his son ties and surpasses him?
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be great,'' Brett Hull said. ``But if you know my
dad at all, you never know when he is going to show up or where he
is going to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   The drive toward 610 reportedly has helped bring the two back
together.
</P>
<P>
   Asked earlier this season about about his son chasing his goal
mark, Bobby Hull said: ``Are you kidding? I'm rooting for him every
night. I'm just like any proud father. I want my son to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull said he doesn't consider himself to be in the same
class as his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, it doesn't take a genius,'' he said. ``My dad was the
best player in the league in his day, and that's not me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brett Hull was the most proliffic NHL goal scorer in the
1990s with 494, including 86 with the St. Louis Blues in 1990-91.
He closed the '90s by adding a third-period goal to beat Anaheim
5-4 on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Goals No. 600 and 601 came in Brett Hull's 900th NHL game,
making him the third-fastest player to reach the milestone _ behind
Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux. His father needed 1,031 games.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Hull, however, went on to score 303 more goals after he
left the NHL for the rival WHA in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Said Brett's brother, Bobby Jr., told the Dallas Morning News:
``I think the 600 is great, and it puts Brett in a great group of
players. But I think he's looking for 610. Getting up there with
Dad, that's what Brett really wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull was not blessed with his father's speed. But he has
nearly as hard a shot and the same knack for putting the puck in
the net.
</P>
<P>
   At 35, the son knows his career is nearing the end. He is in the
middle of a three-year, $17 million deal and the goals don't come
as easily or as often as they once did.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who has battled groin problems, had only two goals in
January. For the season, he has 17, plus 21 assists. He assisted on
both Dallas goals in a 2-1 victory over Edmonton on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told someone this year, `I wish I could get to 610 and then
just quit counting or quit or something,''' Brett said. ``But it is
just, it will be an honor if I am able to pass him. I guess it is a
little mixed. I have so much respect for his career, but I have a
lot of respect for mine, too. I'd like to get as many (goals) as I
can.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Like millions of other Americans, Lillian and Philip Silver
drive from their house in the suburbs on Monday mornings and head
for work. But the similarity ends there.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Silver is dropped off at Greater Rochester
International Airport, where she boards a USAirways jet to La
Guardia Airport 250 miles away and then takes a $25 taxi ride to
her job in Lincoln Center as director of development for the
Metropolitan Opera. Time elapsed from door to door: almost three
hours. For the rest of the week, though, Silver can walk in a few
minutes from Lincoln Center to the couple's Upper West Side
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   It will probably be a long time before commuting by jet becomes
commonplace. But in today's booming economy, it is no longer an
oddity. Silver is one of about a dozen people who commute weekly by
airliner from metropolitan Rochester, N.Y., population 1 million,
to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   In other parts of the country, the trend is more pronounced.
Consider those who commute to Silicon Valley, where the median home
price is more than $400,000. Planes flying into San Jose, Calif.,
on Monday mornings are filled with workers who have spent weekends
with their families in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Utah
where that kind of money can buy a mini-mansion or a small horse
ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Friday afternoon and evening flights leaving Dallas,
Houston and Austin, Texas, are full, as people leaving jobs in one
of those cities fly to their homes in the suburbs of one of the
other cities, a commuting style encouraged by Southwest Airlines,
the low-fare carrier that is based at Love Field in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commuting by plane is not that unusual, I discovered,'' Silver
said. ``The finance director at the Met commutes from Minneapolis.
There are other people at Lincoln Center who commute from Florida
and other places. People made me feel it was quite exotic at first,
but I keep meeting more people who do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver began commuting in 1987 when she left a marketing job at
a Rochester steam utility, a far cry from her dream of finding a
professional home in the art world, and enrolled in Columbia
University's MBA program.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband would say, `We have two children, and three are
away at school,''' she said. When she graduated from Columbia, the
business school asked her to stay on as director of corporate
relations, ``and it was too appealing not to accept,'' she said.
She had worked her way up to the post of associate dean when the
Metropolitan Opera hired her in 1997 to head its fund-raising
operation. Her husband practices law in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Though living alone for four or five days a week has its down
side, it also has its rewards. Commuters can earn hundreds of
thousands of frequent-flier miles annually, for example, and those
who stick to one airline can get upgrades to first class on nearly
every flight even while traveling on the cheapest advance-purchase
fares.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a spouse who makes a good salary in a high-cost
metropolis like New York or San Francisco can afford a home and way
of life in a midsize city hundreds of miles away that colleagues
can only dream of, even after taking into account the cost of the
travel and a small apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The explanations for these highflying commutes range from
careers that put spouses in different cities to the pull of living
in a smaller community with good schools to the expectation (often
misconceived) that a job in another city will last only a couple of
years and is not worth a move.
</P>
<P>
   For Kirk Sapa, who commutes to New York City for his job as
executive vice president of United Way of Tri-State, and his wife,
Dr. Sharon Center, who teaches veterinary medicine at Cornell
University in Ithaca, the reason was professional fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have children,'' Sapa said, ``which makes this far
more doable. And while others have a hard time comprehending it
because they don't do it, the reality in this New York market is
that I probably spend less time commuting than most people in the
suburbs do.'' Sapa drives his pickup truck to the Ithaca Airport,
flies a USAirways prop jet to La Guardia, takes an airport bus to
the Marine Air Terminal and hops the water taxi to the United Way
office on Wall Street. He spends evenings at an apartment the
couple bought in Brooklyn Heights, a short subway ride from his
office.
</P>
<P>
   Some people with children find long-distance commuting not only
doable, but also desirable. Two years ago Jim and Laura Plant moved
their children Conner, now 7, and Delaney, 4, from a tract home on
a cramped lot in Silicon Valley to a 5,000-square-foot manor on
three acres in Salem, Ore. Since then, Plant, 39, has been driving
an hour to Portland on Mondays to take the 10 a.m. Alaska Airlines
100-minute flight to San Jose, where he climbs into his
Mercedes-Benz and drives to his job as communications director of
ReplayTV, a maker of technology for recording television programs
on a hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Oregon, you can buy a really nice home,'' Plant said.
``Sure, my kids miss their dad, but I think they enjoy the quality
of their life in Oregon. And Mom isn't working, while if we lived
in Silicon Valley she probably she would be if we were going to
maintain any lifestyle at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a lot of different reactions to my commute,'' he
added, ``from `I can understand why you are doing it,' to `Gosh, I
couldn't be away from my family for five days.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like many people who commute to work by jetliner, Plant has a
job that involves a lot of travel. He was interviewed by telephone
while in New Orleans on a business trip.
</P>
<P>
   For workaholics, commuting by jet can be a convenient way to
separate work and play. Consider Craig R. Barrett, the chief
executive of the Intel Corp., who for 11 years has been boarding
planes in Arizona for the 600-mile trek to his job in Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``While in Santa Clara, I can work 16 hours a day and not worry
about being late getting home,'' Barrett, who works Tuesdays,
Wednesdays and Thursdays in California, said in an e-mail
interview. ``I usually have dinner meetings the two nights I am
away from home to maximize the use of my time.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Barbara, also travels on business, he said, so ``a
side benefit of all this is that we can often arrange our business
travel to meet in interesting spots for a weekend away.''
</P>
<P>
   David Cay Johnston commutes weekly by jetliner to New York City
from Rochester, where his wife, Jennifer Leonard, the president of
the Rochester Area Community Foundation, and their daughters live.

REGULATORS GET ANOTHER MONTH TO RESCUE SICK HMO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LIZ KOWALCZYK AND RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ State regulators Tuesday assured a judge that Harvard
Pilgrim Health Care is ``operating stably'' and were given another
month to try to save the faltering health maintenance organization.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two weeks, regulators will choose finalists from
among the 13 companies that have expressed interest in buying or
investing in Harvard Pilgrim. Justice Francis Spina of the Supreme
Judicial Court ordered a progress report by March 3 and a hearing
on March 8.
</P>
<P>
   During Tuesday's brief status hearing, Special Assistant
Attorney General J. David Leslie attempted to ease concerns among
the public while reassuring potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie told Spina that there is ``significant interest'' in the
plan from both nonprofit and for-profit organizations, and that
state officials are chasing both possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our belief that only by pursuing these options
aggressively will we be able to determine which options are real,''
he said. ``We do not want to chill the process that involves
for-profits.''
</P>
<P>
   But with opposition building against a for-profit buyout of the
HMO, Leslie said that if Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly
recommends conversion to a for-profit, that process will not go
forward without ``significant public input.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a situation in which there are justifiably different
views,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Restuccia, executive director of Health Care for All, said
afterward that the attorney general must do more than solicit
opinions; he must analyze the impact on consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever option is proposed there needs to be a consumer
impact study done and a careful analysis of both how this affects
HP members and consumers at large in the state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spina said he would rule March 8 on motions by the Massachusetts
Hospital Association, the Massachusetts Psychiatric Society, the
Massachusetts Psychological Association, and the National
Association of Social Workers to become parties in the case. Leslie
asked the judge to postpone the ruling because the MHA attorney was
not at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Health Care For All has not filed a motion to intervene, but
Restuccia said that could change. ``If the AG recommended a
for-profit option to the exclusion of all other options, we would
have serious concerns about that and potentially try to change our
status,'' he said.

HOUSE IGNORES VETO THREAT IN PASSING BILL TO AID TAIWAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ignoring a threatened veto, the House
overwhelmingly approved legislation Tuesday calling for stronger
military ties with Taiwan, action that China says will further
strain Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sponsored by Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, would expand
U.S. training of Taiwanese military officers and end a prohibition
on direct military cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said DeLay's bill would needlessly provoke the Beijing
government as the Clinton administration, many congressional
Republicans and U.S. businesses push for a permanent normalization
of trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   The measure drew bipartisan support from House members, many of
whom characterized China as a growing threat to Taiwan, an island
democracy 90 miles off the Chinese coast, and dismissed concerns
about hampering trade talks with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the dawn of a new century the world must be reassured that
the U.S. will continue to stick by its friends,'' said DeLay, who
originally proposed allowing the sale of specific weapons,
including submarines and a ballistic missile system, to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China launched ballistic missiles into the shipping lanes off
Taiwan in 1996 as the country prepared for its first direct
presidential elections. Since then, the Chinese army has deployed
more than 150 missiles along the coast closest to Taiwan with plans
for hundreds more in the next few years, according to U.S.
intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   The buildup ``has served as a constant threat,'' DeLay said.
``Waiting for the next shoe to fall would be a very costly
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, who urged passage of the bill,
said improving Taiwan's security and enhancing U.S.-China trade
relations are not incompatible. ``Friends of Taiwan should have no
fear of our greater trade with China, just as those who want more
trade with China should not object to us helping Taiwan,'' the
Texas Republican said.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's bill, which passed 341-70, also would require the
Pentagon to plan for increased training operations in the region
and reporting to Congress on threats to Taiwan's security and U.S.
ability to respond. The measure now goes to the Senate, where
Republicans leaders expressed concern that it might destabilize
increased tensions the region.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said that although
the United States has long supported Taiwan's democratic
government, he did not want to complicate already tense relations
in the region. ``We should proceed with due diligence,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   Before the House vote, the Clinton administration cautioned
that, instead of enhancing defense for Taiwan, the DeLay bill would
``seriously diminish Taiwan's security.'' The White House said
Clinton would veto the measure if it clears the Senate in its
present form.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill would mandate a number of new security and military
arrangements with Taiwan that could create dangerous, false and
inaccurate expectations on both sides of the Taiwan Strait,'' said
an unsigned statement issued by the White House Office of
Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, China warned Congress that the legislation could spur a
military confrontation and would retard further improvement of
Sino-U.S. relations, which were set back in the wake of NATO's
bombing of the Chinese Embassy last May in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly urge the U.S. government to take effective
measures to prevent this act from being adopted in the Congress and
to prevent it from becoming law,'' said Yu Shuning, spokesman for
the Chinese Embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan, which broke with the mainland when communists took over
the government in 1949, is considered a renegade province by
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the DeLay bill said during Tuesday's House debate
that it would hamper U.S. efforts to improve trade ties with China
and would make it more difficult to support granting China
permanent trade benefits and its entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Lantos, a California Democrat and frequent critic of
China's human rights record, led the opposition to DeLay's bill,
saying it ``will create horrendous tensions in the Taiwan Strait.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation will not add one single missile to Taiwan's
defense capability, and it will not take away one single missile
from China's,'' Lantos said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I am willing to bet that very few people have whiled
away hours thinking about hot chocolate. Why should anyone?
</P>
<P>
   When it's cold, like these last few weeks have been, it's an
easy pleaser. You either order it in a cafe, where it's hot and
chocolaty and the fluff of steamed milk allows you to justify the
$4. Or you go home, pull out some cocoa, sugar and milk, and whip
some together in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Either choice is pretty good. It's warm and sweet, touched with
just the kind of indulgence you feel entitled to after bearing the
cold. The truth is, though, that most of these are the hot
chocolate equivalents of instant Folgers.
</P>
<P>
   Great hot chocolate is sweet and bitter, frothy and hot, and
slips over your palate like silk. It is a luxury but not dessert.
And it takes no longer to make than a bad hot chocolate _ just a
little finesse and attention and 10 minutes of your time.
</P>
<P>
   But there are so many that fall short, I can no longer count
them. I have had watery ones that taste like soggy candy, and ones
so full of cream that they would better serve as a topping to a
banana split. I have even had a hot white chocolate that tasted
like powdered vanilla soap.
</P>
<P>
   New York chefs, of course, feel obliged to invent their own. And
some are interesting, respectable drinks. At Eleven Madison Park,
the hot chocolate is made with brandy, light brown sugar and
half-and-half and served in a cup the size of a shot glass. It is
delicious and enough. Marquet Patisserie, near Union Square, makes
a milky one that is fragrant with cinnamon and goes down like an
elixir. At Chicama, the South American restaurant at ABC Carpet &AMP;
Home, Douglas Rodriguez makes a thick drink with dark, bitter
Venezuelan chocolate, sweetened condensed milk, allspice and
cloves. He serves it with churros, fried sticks of dough. Save
room.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the chefs intent on changing the drink's nature.
At Morrell Wine Bar and Cafe, Michael Haimowitz adds mulled
cabernet sauvignon. David Walzog, the chef at Tapika, makes a hot
chocolate with dried green chilies and serves it as an
amuse-bouche, when diners arrive for lunch. Yes, before their
roasted sea bass.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these inventions are missing the point: A well-made hot
chocolate is a formidable drink all on its own.
</P>
<P>
   European hot chocolate is this way. It makes an impression. I
can remember the first time I had it in France. It was in Paris, in
a cafe on Ile Saint-Louis. It took a good part of an afternoon to
drink it, and when I left, I felt euphoric. I was, of course.
Partly because of the caffeine and sugar, but mostly because of the
wonders of good chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   La Maison du Chocolat on the Upper East Side serves hot
chocolate like that, melting either Caracas, a dark, bitter
chocolate, or Guayaquil, a mellower, fruity chocolate, and diluting
it with just enough water and cream so that it can be poured.
</P>
<P>
   But hot chocolate needn't be pure chocolate, either. It is meant
to be drunk. And the European style _ thick and intense _ can be
overwhelming. It is more like an espresso: it hits you rather than
warms you. Most American hot chocolate is more like a watered-down
latte: it leaves you warmed but unsatisfied. The best hot
chocolate, in my opinion, falls somewhere in between.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major differences between the two styles is that
American hot chocolate is made with cocoa and most fine European
hot chocolate is based on melted bar chocolate. With cocoa, which
has about 25 percent fat compared with about 40 percent in
bittersweet chocolate, you get a grittier texture and need more
sugar and more cream to give it roundness on the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   And so you need both cocoa and chocolate _ cocoa for its
bitterness, chocolate to round out the edges. Bitterness is the key
to hot chocolate. It is what leaves the palate feeling clean and
hungry for more, rather than being quieted by too much sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   None that I have tasted lived up to that ideal, so I set out to
make what I consider to be a great hot chocolate _ one that is
warming, rich, smoky, creamy and bitter, with a just a nod of
sweetness. Figuring which chocolates to use and in what proportions
were the first challenges.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: It is impossible to make good hot
chocolate with bad chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade or so, brands like Valrhona, from France,
and Callebaut, from Belgium, have trickled into our markets. But
still, they are more available to restaurants than consumers. You
can find good chocolates now, in large expensive chunks, sold for
as much as $15 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   But they are so expensive that Americans generally consider them
a precious treat. The idea of melting them down to make hot
chocolate never occurs to most people.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, when I asked John Scharffenberger, an owner of
Scharffen Berger Chocolate Maker in Berkeley, Calif., the best way
to enjoy fine chocolate, he said in hot chocolate. ``It's just the
way the chocolate flavors come to your palate,'' he said of hot
chocolate. ``All the aromas and flavors are much more volatile
because of the warmth. And because all of the particles are so
dispersed in the liquid, your senses are really engulfed in the
flavors of the chocolate.''
</P>
<P>
   For my hot chocolate, I wanted a high-quality bittersweet
chocolate _ bittersweet and semisweet are not interchangeable.
Semisweet contains more sugar and makes a hot chocolate that is too
sweet.
</P>
<P>
   I tasted five chocolates, melting them in hot milk with a dash
of salt. Callebaut, which many chefs prefer, was pleasant and had
absolutely no personality. Ghirardelli was sweet and heavy on
vanilla. But they were delicious compared with Lindt chocolate,
which had the complexity of a jelly bean and tasted like the
proportions of vanilla and cocoa beans had been reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Scharffen Berger dark chocolate, though, was in another league.
It was smoky, earthy, almost loamy like a potato. But I was swayed
by a more interesting chocolate, Cuana, by La Maison du Chocolat.
It was densely complex, with a smoky aroma and a bit of acidity. As
it should be. A 4.2-ounce bar is $10; the others are $2 to $3 for 4
ounces.

BOSTON FINANCIER SETTING UP $6 BILLION BUYOUT FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Financier Thomas H. Lee is kicking off a leveraged
buyout fund that could top $6 billion, rivaling the biggest private
investment fund ever raised.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston buyout titan's fifth fund is already being marketed
to key clients. It's being billed as an effort to raise $5 billion,
but the buzz in financial circles is that it could well hit the
record books and surpass a $6 billion fund launched in 1996 by New
York's Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's latest fund comes at a time when big money _ namely
pension funds, endowments and other institutions _ is looking for
the next hot fund. The top funds are raising billion-dollar pools
of cash at a rapid-fire pace. Observers expect Lee could pull in
the money he's seeking in less than three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tom Lee could raise that money pretty easily,'' said
Steven Galante, publisher of the Private Equity Analyst. ``The
times are catching up with Tom Lee, but he is probably still a bit
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Some are wondering whether the market for investment funds is
peaking. There have only been a handful of funds in the $5 billion
to $6 billion range since the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But big investors don't want to say no to the new Lee fund. They
fear being left out next time. So they're hoping Lee's track record
can withstand the test of an overheated market.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas H. Lee Co. declined to discuss the new fund.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is considered a ``growth'' buyout fund manager. He looks for
established companies that need a capital infusion and management
help to keep growing. He pumps money into a half dozen companies
each year, then sells them or takes them public. He has one of the
top performance records in the buyout business, providing
triple-digit returns to his investors.
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of returns have become almost commonplace in the
Internet arena, but the Lee firm has served them up through deals
in more mundane industries, like bottled juice, batteries and
credit reports.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's successes are not the stuff of high-tech startups in
garages. The entrepreneurs with cutting edge ideas and no money
tend to be financed by investors at the opposite end of the private
equity spectrum from Lee: venture capitalists. What Lee and the
venture types have in common is that they invest private money in
companies in return for an ownership stake.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Lee did jump onto the Web bandwagon. The firm is
about to close a $1 billion fund that will invest in
Internet-related businesses, as part of its alliance with Putnam
Investments.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors have wondered whether Lee's staff might be
distracted from their traditional buyout fare now that the firm is
entering the Internet rat race. But the size of the new buyout fund
appears to indicate the firm's commitment to its proven niche.
</P>
<P>
   Lee last approached big investors for money in 1997, when the
firm raised $3.5 billion for its fourth fund. If the firm hits its
target, it will zoom past other giant funds, including Warburg
Pincus Ventures's $5 billion venture capital portfolio raised in
1998, and a $4.1 billion fund raised by Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst
last year.

 NEW YORK: 4 ounces.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I tasted three cocoas _ Hershey's, Ghirardelli and Scharffen
Berger _ dissolved in hot water with a little salt. Hershey's had
an aroma of burnt coffee with a finish that lingered perhaps for a
millisecond. Ghirardelli cocoa was earthy with a pleasant tobacco
aroma. It fell flat, however, with an artificial background flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The Scharffen Berger stood out. It had bitterness and a rounded
fruitiness tugging from both ends of its flavor spectrum. And its
finish hung around like a great red wine's. The other cocoas were
promptly removed from my work area.
</P>
<P>
   I had planned to use plain sugar until I tried light brown sugar
and Demerara sugar. White sugar was one-dimensional in comparison.
When I added Demerara, the sweetness became round and seemed to
fill in the gaps left by the white. Light brown sugar did the same
thing but imposed too much of its own molassas flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The only other decision was which kind of liquid: whole milk,
half-and-half or cream. I didn't want to use all cream _ although
some chefs do. At Fairway, Mitchel London adds cream and milk. Hot
chocolates made with cream are not hot chocolate, they are hot
chocolate pudding.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing versions made with milk and half-and-half, I learned
immediately that when you use such rich, heady chocolate and cocoa,
it's difficult to take too much cream. The half-and-half put it
over the top. So, I settled on milk and experimented with the
proportions of chocolate, cocoa and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to say that is all, but it wasn't. Making great hot
chocolate is like making a great cappuccino. It is not just the
flavor; it is also the texture, the temperature and countless other
details that refine it.
</P>
<P>
   Hot chocolate should be heated in a deep pan over medium heat
just until bubbles form around the edge. Boiling it can damage the
volatile flavors in fine chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   To get a frothy top, you need to whisk constantly as it heats.
Whisking aerates the liquid, lightening it at the top where the
froth forms. When you drink a hot chocolate with froth around the
edges, the froth gives a sense of creaminess and lightness, just
like the froth on a cappuccino.
</P>
<P>
   Whisking also emulsifies the ingredients, an important point:
cocoa wants nothing more than to fall to the bottom of the pan like
sediment, so it needs to be constantly reincorporated and dissolved
into the liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Whisking prevents another problem, as well: skin. As much as
some people love the skin that forms on top of warm milk, it has no
place in hot chocolate. It detracts from the flavor and traps in
the aroma from hitting your nose as you sip it.
</P>
<P>
   My hot chocolate, at this point, was good. The flavors were in
balance. It was creamy, yet thin enough, and it had a great froth.
But it needed polish: whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   A tablespoon or so of tightly whipped cream dropped in the hot
chocolate melts into it and foams lightly, so that in the first few
sips you get both hot and cool sensations and an exaggerated sense
of creaminess.
</P>
<P>
   I stirred a little cocoa into whipped cream and spooned it on
top of the hot chocolate. The thought paid off: it was seriously
good. Even for a not-so-serious treat.

AUTOMAKERS REPORT BIG GAINS IN JANUARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related story, GM-HUGHES) 
(mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Americans flocked to dealerships last month to buy the
most recently introduced and most fashionable cars, minivans and
sport utility vehicles available, automakers said Tuesday, as every
manufacturer except DaimlerChrysler announced big gains in sales.
</P>
<P>
   The three quarter-point increases in short-term interest rates
last year by the Federal Reserve seemed to have had no effect on
the torrid auto market last month. The Fed is widely expected to
respond to inflationary pressures in the economy by raising rates
further on Wednesday. But auto executives remained optimistic that
the industry would nearly match this year the record-setting pace
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   If the central bank ``just keeps it small and everything else
stays the same, I think the market will absorb it,'' said Jamie
Jameson, DaimlerChrysler's vice president for sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Rising gasoline prices appeared to have had only a modest effect
on sales of the biggest, most profitable gas-guzzlers last month.
DaimlerChrysler's sales of sport utility vehicles plunged 13
percent last month, led by a 21 percent drop in Dodge Durango
sales. But General Motors' redesigned Chevrolet Suburban and GMC
Yukon XL posted sharp increases.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ballew, GM's director of market analysis, said that the
increase in gasoline prices since last winter had added only about
$25 a month so far to the cost of operating the average new
automobile. That is not enough to influence many buyers, he said,
while declining to speculate whether any further price increases
would change sales patterns significantly.
</P>
<P>
   In a classic sign that Americans remain full of optimism and
enthusiasm about the strength of the economy, the freshest, latest
models sold best last month, whether they were cars or light
trucks. New and fairly new models like the Lincoln LS and Jaguar
S-Type sedans, the Ford Focus hatchback, the Honda Odyssey minivan
and the redesigned Chevrolet Tracker sport utility vehicle all sold
briskly last month. Sales lagged for older models like the Ford
Crown Victoria and Honda Accord sedans, the Mercury Villager
minivan and the Jeep Cherokee sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Among automakers with headquarters in the Detroit area, GM, with
a slew of new sport utility vehicles and pickups backed up with
generous discounts, did best among the leading automakers last
month, with sales rising 11.5 percent compared with January of last
year. Ford Motor Co.'s sales rose 4 percent, excluding Volvo Cars,
which Ford bought last March. DaimlerChrysler's sales dipped 4.8
percent, including its Mercedes division.
</P>
<P>
   GM fared poorly in January 1999, making its performance look
better this year, while Ford and DaimlerChrysler did very well a
year ago, one reason why their sales last month seemed less
impressive. DaimlerChrysler's sales also suffered because winter
storms hurt showroom traffic in the Northeast, one of its strongest
markets, Jameson said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and DaimlerChrysler appeared to have lost market share last
month to Toyota, which reported an increase of 35.7 percent in
sales, and Nissan, where sales leaped 26.7 percent. Nissan's strong
results were the latest sign that the Japanese automaker may be
halting a long erosion in its market share, as new models like the
Maxima sedan and Xterra sport utility vehicle have proved popular.
</P>
<P>
   Other foreign automakers also prospered last month, including
Volkswagen, up 47.7 percent; Subaru, up 27 percent; Mitsubishi, up
9.1 percent, and Honda, up 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of small automakers did not release results Tuesday,
making it hard to calculate companies' market shares precisely.
GM's Ballew said that the industry's overall sales appeared to have
run last month at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of more than 17
million automobiles. That represents a fast pace, given that sales
last year totaled 16.9 million vehicles, but the industry is
expected to slow somewhat later in the year because of rising
interest rates and energy prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting some moderation this year, but not a heck of a
lot,'' Ballew said.

 &HT;    Libertarians outflank Dems in TexasBy Gaiutra Bahadur
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Despite their lack of a central office or any
paid staff, the Libertarians have outflanked the once-powerful
Texas Democrats by fielding four more candidates in statewide races
for the Nov. 7 election.
</P>
<P>
   But the party's reach up and down the ticket _ from the nearly
obsolete county posts of public weigher to that of U.S. senator _
is more of a gambit to maintain its hard-earned ballot status than
a serious run for power, as its state campaign coordinator,
Geoffrey Neale, readily acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of the strategy,'' said Neale, an Austin-based
computer software consultant whose wife, Nancy, is a Libertarian
candidate for the state Board of Education. ``This is a money game;
let's face it. It's cheaper for us to put candidates in races,
especially when the Democrats choose not to contest them. The
bottom line is a paper candidate can save us several thousands of
dollars in ballot access fees.''
</P>
<P>
   The more candidates running, especially in races where one of
the major parties has bowed out, the greater the odds of the
Libertarians winning the 5 percent of the vote they need in a
statewide race every election cycle to keep their spot on the
ballot. If they don't achieve that goal, then they will need to
gather about 50,000 signatures from voters who did not participate
in either the Democratic or Republican primary, a process both
costly and difficult.
</P>
<P>
   These hurdles have made for an unconventional gallery on the
ticket. They include a few almost accidental candidates and a
priest of Wicca, a nature-centric pagan religion with hundreds of
followers at nearby Fort Hood and throughout Central Texas. And
they are less concerned about electability than most major party
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   For Tom Davis, a computer systems professional with Dell who has
steered clear of politics for most of his 54 years, the road to the
Libertarian Party was an easy and natural one. As a practicing
Wicca-- , he already subscribed to a credo Libertarians apply to
government, ``If it harm none, do as you will,'' when he joined the
party a little over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wicca is ``a spiritual path in which individual freedom is
highly emphasized,'' as it is by Libertarians, said Davis, who is
the sole challenger to incumbent Democrat Gonzalo Barrientos for
state Senate in Austin's District 14. ``Most legislators go to the
sessions with the objective of passing bills. My agenda is to
unpass things, to remove incursions into our freedom, to try to
minimize government.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, president of the Pagan Alliance of Central Texas, expects
that the public reaction to his faith will include snickers and
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are going to see that, and some are going to
turn off automatically,'' he said. ``Others will ask, `What does
that mean?' Essentially, -- t's just who I am. I'm a candidate, and
I'm a Wiccan. ... I'm not emphasizing it, and I'm not hiding it. I
have a hunch it's going to follow me around, and that's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The party does expect to win at least five races. Its candidates
are the only ones running for county office-- of public weigher,
created in 1883 as an independent source of weights for farmers
selling grain and other products. Once elected, the Libertarians
plan to abolish the positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of a couple of old public offices that are obsolete.
In some counties, the position has been struck. In most counties,
it is still there,'' said Robert ``Rock'' Howard, chairman of the
Travis County Libertarians. In 1988, Libertarian Wendall
Weatherford was elected Travis County public weigher in 1988, only
to abolish the post in his second term.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an example of how the government doesn't clean up
after itself,'' Neale said. ``Our goal is to eliminate them all.''

 &HT;    Anemic farewell for Bush in New Hampshire
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Sub-freezing temperatures and an even colder
New Hampshire electorate left Gov. George W. Bush cloistered with
family at his hotel Tuesday to ride out what would become his first
defeat since taking on front-runner status a year ago. It was an
anemic finale to weeks of campaigning in the Granite state, host to
the nation's first primary, and the place where Texas's favorite
son proved unable to charm Yankee voters. As early exit polls
rolled in showing McCain's commanding lead, Bush spent time with a
family entourage that included his wife, Laura, 18-year-old twin
daughters Barbara and Jenna, sister Doro Bush Koch and her husband,
Bobby Koch, and nieces and nephews.
</P>
<P>
   Asked earlier in the day if losing New Hampshire would be a
setback, Bush said: ``It's a marathon. It's a long haul. I'm a
patient man. I've got a disciplined campaign. I've got a vision for
the future, so I'm ready for what comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush set off before sunrise, but wound up at his hotel before 11
a.m. Virtually floating on a sea of television cameras and boom
mikes, he shook hands outside a voter precinct in Manchester, but
was quickly hustled off when campaign handlers realized the
entourage was overwhelming voters making their way along the icy
sidewalk to cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter asked Bush how many precincts he planned to visit:
``I don't know,'' he said, looking frazzled as he hurried back to
his campaign bus. ``It depends on whether or not we create such
total chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Bush greeted voters outside four precincts, in
Manchester, Nashua and Bedford. He declared a brownie handled to
him by a supporter of U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley, ``fabulous,'' and he
poured coffee and shook hands at Blake's ice cream restaurant.
Wearing an overcoat, ostrich-skinned boots and, when the cold hit
hard, leather gloves, Bush complained about the 2-degree
temperature (with the wind chill factor), but never stopped
whimsically wooing women voters and lunging to grasp men's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was cheered at each spot by a sign-waving Texas contingent
that included Edward Steves and Weisie Steen, both 47 and both from
San Antonio. They were part of about 200 Texans who paid their own
way to New Hampshire to whip up support for Bush as he headed
toward the finish line in his first serious contest of the
campaign.Bush seemed to sense the approaching bad news. Lifting
weights at Gold's Gym, down the road from his hotel, Bush was
serious and focused. He chatted with the other exercisers but
showed little of his trademark ebullence.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the morning refusing to concede that he could lose New
Hampshire. He also took care to paint the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``...I think Republicans need somebody who can run across the
nation,'' Bush said. ``This is a long process. He has run a good
campaign here, but so have I. And I'm going to go to the next state
and the next state and the next state until I win my party
nomination and then I'm going to unite our party and lead us to
victory.''

BRITISH, IRISH AND U.S. SCRAMBLE TO SAVE ULSTER POWER-SHARING
PACT 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain, Ireland and the United States struggled
Tuesday night to preserve the power-sharing government in Belfast
after the leader of that two-month-old government said shutting it
down had become ``inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   The crisis developed when the Irish Republican Army's signaled
its unwillingness to begin disarming, and Prime Minister Tony
Blair, his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern and President Clinton in
Washington responded by trying urgently to find a way out.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference with somber party members flanking him in
the Stormont parliament building in Belfast, David Trimble, the
first minister of the Northern Ireland assembly, said he expected
Britain to suspend self-government in Northern Ireland and then
reimpose the direct rule it relinquished only two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   What gave rise to his call was a confidential report by Gen.
John de Chastelain of Canada, head of the panel responsible for
supervising disarmament, that offered no evidence that the IRA had
made any move to begin scrapping its arsenal. The IRA has long
considered disarming a gesture of surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, leader of the pro-British Ulster Unionists, said he had
not seen the report, which was delivered to the British and Irish
governments shortly before a midnight deadline Monday night. But he
said that whatever language de Chastelain used could not mask the
fact that no destruction of weapons had taken place.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA issued a statement in Belfast Tuesday night that made no
mention of arms turnovers but pledged its commitment to a
``permanent peace.'' The clandestine organization said the fact
that it was holding to its cease-fire was proof of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRA's guns are silent and there is no threat to the peace
process from the IRA,'' the three-paragraph statement concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing,
warned that the entire peace undertaking in Northern Ireland was
now in jeopardy. ``If the Ulster Unionist party either walks away
from the process or forces the governments to collapse this
process, then I don't see how we are going to put it together
again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams contests Trimble's claim that the IRA is obliged to start
disarming now, saying the only operative deadline is the date of
May 22 in the original peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland secretary, locked in
intense discussions with Irish Foreign Minister Brian Cowen,
continued to keep the language of the report of the weapons
monitoring agency private, saying, ``We need to create a small
breathing space to see if we can find a solution to the crisis we
are facing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Clinton said the White House was ``heavily
involved'' in the trans-Atlantic talks. ``It would be a tragedy if
it were derailed,'' Clinton said of the peace settlement. ``But in
order to keep it going, everybody's going to have to, you know,
honor the terms of the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair's spokesman said that London and Dublin would decide their
next moves during the coming days, adding, ``There are clearly
difficult judgments to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``You don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize
that we are not as far down the road as we would like to be, but
that doesn't mean we are at the end of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   London and Dublin are sponsors of the April 1998 peace agreement
brokered by former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell that created the
assembly in Belfast and a group of other governmental bodies
designed to balance the desires of the Protestant majority that
Ulster remain part of Britain and of the Catholic minority that the
province establish closer links with Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The path to political stability to the conflicted province _
where more than 3,300 lives have been lost in 30 years of sectarian
violence _ has unwound in a succession of tense and spiteful
standoffs and 11th-hour rescue measures. The outcomes have been
begrudging and mistrustful compromises with limited staying powers.
</P>
<P>
   An unaccustomed sense of euphoria swept Northern Ireland in
December with the start-up of the coalition government with its
mechanisms for giving Catholics and Protestants an equal say in the
affairs of the province. Hope for the future was symbolized by the
sight of men known to have been members of sectarian paramilitary
gangs dressed in suits and ties and sitting in ministers' chairs in
offices with titles on the doors.
</P>
<P>
   That spirit was gone Tuesday as Ahern told the Irish parliament
that ``we have hit very difficult times. We are now at a crucial
stage and in an extremely delicate period.'' He said, ``It would be
a disaster, to put it at its mildest, if any of the institutions
were allowed to slide.''
</P>
<P>
   Disaster or not, suspending the home rule government is an
option that the British may be obliged to take in order to
forestall longer-range damage to those political institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Other courses of action risk losing the continuing participation
of Trimble, a onetime intransigent Protestant leader whose
transformation into moderate deal-broker within his party has made
him indispensable to many British eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's of enormous importance for the people of Northern
Ireland that David Trimble maintains his leadership position, but
others must act if he is going to remain in the position he is,''
Mandelson said.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Trimble took a gamble in persuading his party to
enter government with Sinn Fein even though no paramilitary weapons
had been turned in. To persuade his party members to go against
what had been a bedrock conviction of ``no guns, no government,''
he promised to resign as first minister in February if the IRA did
not take steps to disarm by then.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA appointed representatives to de Chastelain's commission,
and there was widespread expectation that these appointments would
lead to progress by the arms monitoring agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was made clear to Sinn Fein again and again and again that
this risk we were taking would be time-limited and would not run
beyond the end of January,'' Trimble said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble has reason to count on the British to suspend the
Belfast government before a scheduled Feb. 12 meeting of the Ulster
Unionists' 860-member party council. Under present circumstances,
he would be forced to make good on his promise to step down then.
</P>
<P>
   And Britain has reason to accommodate him. The leading
contenders to succeed him as party leader are opponents or only
mild enthusiasts of the peace settlement. They would be less
willing to pursue a peace that is based on balancing power between
the Catholic and Protestant parties.

FORMER KOSOVO GUERRILLAS NOW BATTLE SNOW, ICE AND COLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Former fighters of the Kosovo Liberation
Army have turned their attention to more mundane tasks in recent
weeks, performing their first public service job as the newly
formed Kosovo Protection Corps.
</P>
<P>
   The onetime guerrillas have turned out with pickaxes to clear
the ice from Pristina streets as this impoverished province in
southern Serbia battles its latest woe _ heavy snowfalls and
temperatures in the low teens.
</P>
<P>
   The main power plant went out of action just as the freeze
arrived. Killings are still taking place at a rate of about one a
day. Progress is measured in shades: there were no reported
kidnappings as of two weeks ago, and no looting.
</P>
<P>
   But arson and grenade attacks are still occurring, and no one
dares to suggest that the vicious cycle of revenge and retaliation
between Serb and Albanian is waning, if in some areas it is being
contained.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, where the children enjoy the freeze, tobogganing
down steep, icy streets where few cars venture, there are more
signs of what passes for normality.
</P>
<P>
   The British Royal Green Jackets, responsible for security and
for protecting the 1,200-member Serbian community here in the
capital of the mostly Albanian-inhabited province report that only
one Serb has been killed in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo's first bank, the Micro Enterprise Bank, was opened
recently. Its founding was the initiative of the European Bank of
Reconstruction and Development and a consortium of European banks.
It will provide retail banking for citizens of Kosovo and offer
loans to small businesses. The U.N. administration that now governs
Kosovo has organized a licensing agency and says it will close down
any local banks trying to operate without a license.
</P>
<P>
   Even if electricity is not always guaranteed, many local news
organizations and state companies now have unlimited access to the
Internet, thanks to the International Rescue Committee, an American
charity.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Meyer of the committee has hooked up the United Nations and
major relief organizations via microwave antennas and from the
proceeds is providing the local university, news organizations,
hospitals and schools with free connections. Kosovo's computer
owners no longer have to send e-mail via Belgrade, and the
university may soon apply for an Internet domain for Kosovo, ko, a
statement of sorts of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   And Kosovo's richest son, Behgjet Pacolli, returned recently to
offer the ugly city center a face lift. He is the head of the
Swiss-based construction group Mabetex, which has built glitzy
palaces in many cities in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Pacolli held court in Pristina and laid out plans to rebuild a
central bank building and a shopping complex, both damaged last
year in the NATO bombing campaign against the forces of President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pristina needs an entire new downtown,'' Pacolli said,
offering to put his own money into the reconstruction and thus
blaze the trail for investment by foreigners and by Kosovo
Albanians living abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In another hopeful sign, some 6,000 people have moved from tents
or half-built houses into community shelters that the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees has prepared around the province.
</P>
<P>
   It is only half the number expected, but Dennis McNamara, the
head of the refugee agency's Kosovo operations, accentuates the
positive. The fact that Albanians without homes are surviving, he
said, ``shows the resilience and sheer determination of those
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are hanging on in difficult circumstances,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially the most important development of recent weeks is on
the political front. Echoing McNamara's brand of optimism, Bernard
Kouchner, the U.N. special representative in Kosovo, says he is
close to getting Serbian leaders to join a new political structure,
the Joint Administrative Council.
</P>
<P>
   Devised as the beginning of a local coalition government, it is
intended to bring together Serbs, Albanians and the international
officials who have been running Kosovo. It has so far proven as
cumbersome as its name, but it is widely seen as the only way for
the United Nations to involve local leaders in decisions and thus
enlist their support and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the most important Albanian leaders are already on
board. A seat for a Serb has been open since the council was formed
on Dec. 15. Now, after intensive diplomacy by Kouchner and his U.N.
team, Serbian community leaders, who walked out of the last
council, have agreed to try to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, members of the Serbian National Council, led by
Bishop Artemije, the head of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo,
told Dr. Kouchner that they would join, pending agreement of
Serbian leaders in the northern part of the province around the
town of Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   If a Serb does take up the fourth chair on the council, other
Serbs will be appointed co-heads of 2 of the 19 departments or
ministries, although Kouchner warned that relations between the two
groups would remain ``horribly complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   The message that some sort of dialogue is necessary before the
elections scheduled for autumn seems to be sinking in. Hashim
Thaci, the former political leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
sounded at his most conciliatory when asked in an interview about
the Serbs' joining the council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbs are going to be engaged in departments and we are going
to manage to resolve open issues,'' he said, ``especially the
division of Mitrovica and the release of missing people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the two ethnic communities seem ever more solidly
divided. New clinics and schools are being organized in
Serbian-populated areas, where residents are scared to attend
institutions in neighborhoods dominated by Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials are no longer talking of preserving a multiethnic
society so much as encouraging tolerance and preventing further
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the tens of thousands of Serbs who fled Kosovo after
NATO troops arrived and the Serbian police pulled out are said to
be returning. But the U.N. refugee agency is bracing for 100,000 to
200,000 Albanian refugees expected to be returning from Europe in
the next year, an influx that will require the continuation of
shelter and rebuilding programs.

HOUSE VOTES TO EXPAND U.S. MILITARY TIES WITH TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to expand
military ties between Taiwan and the United States, a move that
China and the Clinton administration warned could escalate regional
tensions and jeopardize a landmark trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, approved by a bipartisan vote of 341-70, calls for the
United States to establish direct military communications between
Washington and Taipei, expand American training of Taiwan military
officers and conduct an annual review on threats to Taiwan's
security.
</P>
<P>
   While the provisions of the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act are
more symbolic than substantive _ American administrations have been
empowered to provide Taiwan with military aid for more than two
decades _ moving toward more formal military relations with Taiwan
could have damaging diplomatic consequences with China.
</P>
<P>
   If enacted, critics said, the bill would upset Washington's
deliberately ambiguous ``one China'' policy that treats Taiwan as a
part of China and recognizes Beijing as China's capital, but also
allows the United States to provide Taiwan with defensive weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would bring about very serious damage to China-U.S.
relations,'' Yu Shuning, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy here,
said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition from Republicans and Democrats last fall had forced
the bill's sponsors to strip out its most contentious language,
including authorization to sell Taiwan specific weapons like
missile defenses, air-to-air missiles and diesel-powered
submarines.
</P>
<P>
   With those changes in mind, 140 Democrats felt free on Tuesday
to join 200 Republicans and 1 independent in saluting Taiwan's
democratic government and its formidable lobby here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is far less confrontational than the original
legislation,'' said Rep. Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut, the senior
Democrat on the House International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they were saving their lobbying
effort for the Senate, where the watered-down version still faces
stiff opposition, and possible defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader who is a
strong supporter of Taiwan, urged caution against complicating
U.S.-China relations. ``We should proceed with due diligence,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's national security aides have advised him to
veto the measure if Congress approves it, arguing that it goes well
beyond the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. That measure allows the
United States to arm Taiwan with defensive weaponry and implicitly
commits Washington to defend Taiwan against any attack.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had backed up its commitment to Taiwan in
recent years. The Pentagon dispatched two aircraft-carrier battle
groups to the Taiwan Straits in 1996 after China fired missiles
toward Taiwan. Between 1994 and 1998, Gejdenson said, the United
States approved $2 billion in arms to Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   But the timing of this bill is a major headache for the
administration, especially as American officials have tried to mend
relations with China since the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade last May.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill would mandate a number of new security and military
arrangements with Taiwan that could create dangerous, false and
inaccurate expectations on both sides of the Taiwan Straits,'' said
an administration policy statement.
</P>
<P>
   But an influential Taiwanese lobbyist said Tuesday's vote would
play well among all major candidates in Taiwan's presidential
elections next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Symbolically, Congress has sent a very strong signal to the
people of Taiwan that the U.S. is committed to their security,''
said Wenyen Chen, president of the Formosan Association for Public
Affairs, a lobbying group for Taiwan here.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's vote followed nearly two hours of sometimes sharp
debate on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, led by Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip,
said the measure clarified and reaffirmed Washington's commitment
to Taiwan's security in the face of a growing Chinese military
buildup. ``Given the volatility of the situation in the Taiwan
Straits, any mixed signals by our government can easily be read by
the Communist Chinese as complacency,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, said, ``If we
truly love freedom, we must protect democratic Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics said the bill was unnecessary and counterproductive,
and could create a new barrier to a vote later this year on
granting China permanent trade benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will do nothing, repeat, nothing to enhance Taiwan's
security,'' said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif. ``It will stir up a
hornet's nest in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., said, ``Our policy is effective, it's
worked for 21 years, why are we changing it now?''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Taiwan bill disputed fears by some lawmakers
that the measure could imperil the vote on China's trade benefits,
a step American and Chinese negotiators agreed to last November
that cleared the way for China's entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends of Taiwan should have no fear of our greater trade
with China, just as those who want more trade with China should not
object to us helping Taiwan,'' said Armey.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even before Tuesday's vote, trade was on the minds of
congressional leaders who met with Clinton at the White House to
discuss the budget. Armey said Republicans and Democrats agreed to
hold the China vote as early as possible, before election politics
gets in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably it would be more difficult later in the year because
politics gets more intense later in the year and politics can screw
up a bowling ball,'' Armey said at his weekly news conference.
</P>
<P>
   But congressional leaders cautioned that it may be difficult to
call up the bill before May because of ongoing trade negotiations
between the European Union and China, and because Congress will
have to hold hearings on the issue before it votes.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Republicans stressed to Clinton that he needed to step up
his efforts to convince House Democrats to vote for the measure if
he wants to see China become a member of the World Trade
Organization. Supporters are trying to muster at least 100 votes
among the 211 House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Siewert, a White House spokesman, said Clinton has already
started working to win the China-WTO vote. In addition, the
business community has started its own $6 million lobbying campaign
to get the measure approved.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Lott predicted that the trade vote will pass
if conditions are right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to do it,'' Lott said at a U.S. Chamber of
Commerce breakfast. ``But China's going to have to watch its
conduct. And the president's going to have to weigh in aggressively
with the Democratic leadership.''

YORK TIMES WRITER, DIES AT 69  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
(Attn: Conn., R.I., Pa., Australia) MARY CANTWELL, AUTHOR AND NEW By JAMES BARRON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mary Cantwell, who wrote essays, books and editorials
for The New York Times, many about the changing public and private
lives of women in America, died Tuesday at New York University
Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 69.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Margaret Lescher of
Riverdale, the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of The Times editorial board for 16 years, Cantwell
wrote often about issues affecting women. A notable one concerned
``the squeal rule,'' the label she coined for a 1982 Reagan
administration proposal to forbid giving contraceptives to
teen-agers unless their parents were informed. Such a rule, she
wrote, would discourage effective contraception and increase
teen-age pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to the coinage,'' the columnist William Safire later
wrote, ``the battle is being won by the anti-squeal forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from unsigned editorials, Cantwell wrote personal
observations for The Times and elsewhere about the pride and pain
brought by three decades of transformation in the lives of women,
particularly in the spheres of work, marriage and divorce, and
parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   Why could she not cry about a sick calico cat, she wondered in a
``Close to Home'' column in 1990. One reason, she realized, is that
``Women were reputed to weep on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not this woman. No way I was going to let somebody know I'd
been gotten at; no way I was going to give somebody that
satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   On divorce, she gave voice to many readers' feelings in a
``Hers'' column in The Times in 1980, describing the day she and
her former husband watched their older daughter's high school
graduation: ``There on stage is someone who is half he, half she;
their blood, their genes. They created somebody: the woman is awed.
As long as there is a she, the woman thinks, there is an us.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting in her childhood in Bristol, R.I., Cantwell was an
acute observer of the era in which she lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted to be anything but a writer,'' she once said,
``but I saw no hope, had no expectations. I feel, perhaps wrongly,
that I grew up in an era when writing was very much a boys' club.
It took a brave woman, braver than I, to write books.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she wrote three. The first, ``American Girl'' (Random
House, 1992), was a love letter to Bristol. A Times reader ``wrote
in and said there is a small town in the background of everything I
ever wrote, so why didn't I write about that small town,'' she
said. So she did, about a three-generation household in a town
where the oldest resident carried a gold-headed cane to lead the
Fourth of July parade.
</P>
<P>
   After ``An American Girl,'' her readers wrote in again. Now they
wanted to know what happened to that girl. ``New York was what
happened to that girl,'' Cantwell said, explaining how she came to
write ``Manhattan, When I Was Young'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1995). It
described her life in the prosperous postwar years, the heyday of
the Stork Club and Bonwit Teller.
</P>
<P>
   In her third book, ``Speaking With Strangers'' (Houghton
Mifflin, 1998), she talked about pushing herself to travel, after
the end of her marriage to Robert Lescher, a literary agent. She
also described an on-again-off-again affair with a celebrated
Southern writer she identified only as ``the balding man,'' a
womanizer who dropped her for someone younger.
</P>
<P>
   She said that she had not wanted to distract readers by naming
him. Later, after many critics and some readers had guessed, she
acknowledged him to be James Dickey.
</P>
<P>
   After Cantwell graduated from Connecticut College in 1953, she
landed a job in New York as a copywriter at Mademoiselle magazine,
where she worked during the next 23 years, including 9 as managing
editor and features editor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, she was invited to be one of the early guest writers of
the Hers column in The Times. Later that year, she joined the Times
editorial board, commenting on social policy issues like smoking,
abortion and assisted suicide, and on whimsical topics such as the
world as seen from the M10 bus.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, she wrote ``Dear Abby,'' a widely quoted editorial
about Evangeline Gouletas-Carey, the new wife of Hugh L. Carey, the
governor of New York. Before the wedding, Gouletas-Carey described
herself as a widow. But her former husband turned up alive and
well, and so did two other former husbands she had not mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Abby'' read as if it were a letter to the advice
columnist from Gouletas-Carey. ``What I want to know is, Abby, can
you think of a way I might have avoided all this fuss?'' It was
signed, ``Wondering.''
</P>
<P>
   She matured as a writer, she said, after she discovered the
novelist Jean Rhys. ``That was a writer I could best emulate,'' she
said last year. ``That was a life and sensibility I understood.''
</P>
<P>
   She was struck by one Rhys observation: ``If I stop writing my
life will have been an abject failure,'' Rhys wrote in ``Smile,
Please,'' an autobiographical memoir. ``I will not have earned
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Cantwell reflected on that in a 1980 ``Hers'' column. ``To earn
one's death,'' she wrote, ``I think of it as a kind of parlor game.
How, I shall ask my friends, would you like to earn your deaths?
And how would I like to earn mine? The question is strangely
liberating, implying as it does action, energy, choice. In fact, it
has an unexpectedly American ring: death as First Prize. I like it
_ it makes the nights less frightening.``
</P>
<P>
   Besides Margaret Lescher, she is survived by another daughter,
Katherine Lescher of Sydney, Australia; her mother, Mary G.
Cantwell of Bristol; a sister, Diana Nickerson of Pittsburgh; and a
granddaughter.

PATRIOTS STAFF IS TAKING SHAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ On a day when he firmed up five positions on
his staff, new Patriots coach Bill Belichick spoke of plans for an
offensive line development program and a tough policy on attendance
at the strength and conditioning program.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick announced that longtime New England assistant Dante
Scarnecchia has decided to remain with the team as assistant head
coach/offensive line coach, and also staying on are assistant
offensive line coach Jeff Davidson, who will be in charge of
developing young linemen, and wide receivers coach Ivan Fears.
Belichick also made it official that Charlie Weis is his new
offensive coordinator and that Eric Mangini has been hired as a
defensive assistant. Both were with the New York Jets last season.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week, Belichick said, he will name a defensive
coordinator _ likely to be Rick Venturi _ and fill in the rest of
his staff: defensive backs coach (likely Mangini), linebackers
coach, defensive line coach, quarterbacks coach, and running backs
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick also is working with CEO Andy Wasynczuk on a plan of
attack for the team's free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have as many back as we can,'' said Belichick.
``That's going to be hard to do, and we'll have tough choices. It's
unlikely we'll be able to retain all the players who are
unrestricted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have a good team on a consistent basis here rather
than put everything into one year. The decision comes down to one
player for a lot of money or three or four players for the same
money.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure he wants Lawyer Milloy back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very safe to say I like Lawyer,'' said Belichick. ``He's
an outstanding person and fine player. I thought he had a
tremendous future when he was a a rookie here. He's been a terrific
player. But you need two sides to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Lawyer came here and we watched a Washington vs.
someone . . . I forget. I like to watch film with players to see
what their recall is and to see how important football is to them.
If you're hearing, `Who's that receiver _ 16?'' you can tell
they're not really into it. He hadn't watched a film in four months
and he had total recall of the game. It was one of the most
impressive performances I'd ever seen, right there with Eric
Turner.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick thinks the Patriots will be able to get back to an
offensive plan similar to what Ray Perkins had in place here in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie will work on being able to mix the running game and
passing game and utilize our personnel as much as possible,'' he
said. ``Drew (Bledsoe) is a sharp guy and obviously has a lot of
experience and awareness. Charlie and I have talked about that.
It'll still be an adjustment for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick stuck with Fears because he has coached against him
and respects him.Fears is popular among the current receivers,
including Terry Glenn, who was thrilled to hear Fears was
returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Charlie and Ivan, I think that's a great combination,''
said Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said he once tried signing Davidson as a free agent
lineman in Cleveland but his agent wanted too much money. Now he'll
get him as a coach. Belichick developed a system for training
linemen in Cleveland and has used it everywhere he's been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been successful,'' said Belichick. ``It has to be
a 12-month project. A lot of offensive linemen aren't ready to play
when they come into the league, and after a couple of years, if
they're not ready to play, then we have to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to improve linemen in their first or second year
or someone else will take their spot. I'm committed to it. We're
going to get better on the offensive line and we're going to do it
with younger players. If they're not willing to work hard and are
not dedicated, it will be somebody else. It means staying out after
practice, before practice, extra meetings, all that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said he has two candidates to replace strength coach
Johnny Parker, whom he abruptly fired last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Johnny for 15 years, and I have a lot of respect
for Johnny, and I have an appreciation for the hard work he's
done,'' said Belichick. ``I wanted to take this program in a
different direction. I've talked to a couple of people. I wanted to
get offensive and defensive coaches in place first.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said he spoke to Ty Law Tuesday about the importance
of participating in the team's program, rather than working out on
his own with Bob Kersee. This may be the first line in the sand
that Belichick is drawing with players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect what Ty's doing, but at the same time, I talked to
Ty about what we talked about,'' said Belichick. ``We plan to have
a later discussion on that. There's more than one way to skin a
cat. But our program is important to us. Our players are going to
participate in it, the players who do will gain too much advantage
over those who don't and they'll push them out.''

HEALTH AGENCY CRACKS DOWN ON GENE THERAPY RESEARCHERS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Pa., Calif., Tenn.)   (Eds.: Fixes first reference spelling of Gelsinger, 6th graf)  
(jw) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Officials at the National Institutes of Health admitted Tuesday
that they had failed to keep track of how patients fared during
gene therapy experiments and outlined steps to ensure that
scientists follow rules requiring them to report information about
harmful side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were receiving only a small number of adverse event reports
and we certainly should have recognized this as a sign of
underreporting,'' Dr. Ruth L. Kirschstein, the acting director,
wrote in a letter to a congressman. In an interview, another
institute official said, ``There is no excuse for it and it should
have been noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   The admission by Kirschstein, in a letter to Rep. Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., comes on the eve of a congressional inquiry into lapses
of federal oversight into gene therapy in general, and the death of
an 18-year-old patient in one experiment at the University of
Pennsylvania in particular.
</P>
<P>
   In an exchange of letters with Waxman, officials at the
institutes had acknowledged that of 691 serious side effects
experienced by patients in a particular type of gene therapy
experiments, only 39 were reported immediately, as required by the
agency. Only after an institute inquiry into the death were other
reports received. In a Jan. 10 letter, Waxman complained, ``This is
a failure rate of roughly 95 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   In her reply, Kirschstein said Tuesday that scientists might
have been confused about the reporting requirements.
``Nevertheless,'' she wrote, ''while this is an explanation for
inadequate reporting, it is not an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The admissions comes as authorities are closely examining the
10-year-old field of gene therapy. The effort stems largely from
the death of Jesse Gelsinger, a University of Pennsylvania patient,
who enrolled in a trial to test a treatment for an inherited enzyme
deficiency. He died after suffering an overwhelming immune reaction
to an infusion of corrective genes.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Food and Drug Administration shut down all gene
therapy experiments at the university.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., will convene a hearing
into the death. Gelsinger's father, Paul, will testify, as will
officials from the Food and Drug Administration and the health
institutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the oversight system is failing to prevent serious
violations of patient protection,'' Frist said Tuesday. ``Let's
have full transparency in the system.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, it has become clear that the system is not as
transparent as federal rules require. Typically, researchers
experimenting with drugs and therapies are monitored by the FDA,
which is required to keep all patient safety information a secret
so that companies are not at a competitive disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Gene therapy has always been an exception; because it is so
novel, it is also monitored by the health institute through a panel
of medical and ethics experts called the Recombinant DNA Advisory
Committee. The RAC, as the committee is known, conducts all its
work in public.
</P>
<P>
   Federal rules require that all serious side effects, whether or
not directly related to gene therapy, be disclosed immediately to
the institute. But even before Gelsinger's death, the advisory
committee's members had concerns that the requirements were not
being met. One company, Schering-Plough Corp., insisted that
information about gene therapy side effects be classified as a
proprietary trade secret, a position the company has since
rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   To force scientists to comply with the rules, Kirschstein said
the institute would begin inspections of institutions that
conducted gene therapy research, including records reviews. The
agency has also repeated its rules to all scientists conducting
gene therapy research, and as a backup, it is now receiving weekly
reports from the FDA about all side effects in gene therapy
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The move to force greater disclosure is likely to be met with
opposition from the biotechnology industry. Michael Werner, a
lawyer for the Biotechnology Industry Organization, a trade group,
said Tuesday that while companies wanted to comply with institute
rules, ``we are certainly concerned if the NIH is going to turn
this information over to the RAC, a public body.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as officials know, Gelsinger was the first person to die
as a direct result of participating in a gene therapy experiment.
Most patients in the experiments are already seriously ill, often
with cancer, and many die during the course of the research from
problems related to their diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger's case was unusual in that he was not particularly
sick; he suffered from a mild form of the enzyme deficiency. The
Pennsylvania experiment was designed to test the safety of a
treatment for babies with a fatal form of his disorder. It involved
an infusion of corrective genes, encased in a weakened cold virus,
adenovirus.
</P>
<P>
   The 691 reports gathered so far include side effects like high
fevers, serious infections and seizures, but the majority appeared
related to the patients' underlying diseases, according to an
institute official. But, the official said, it will be impossible
to determine if any patients have been harmed in gene therapy
research until the agency completes a review of the reports.
</P>
<P>
   The reports are from all studies that used adenovirus, which
account for only one quarter of all the gene therapy clinical
trials that have been conducted over the past decade. So it is
possible that there are many more reports outstanding; in an
interview Tuesday, Waxman said he was trying to press the institute
to obtain the additional information.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, it is unacceptable for the NIH not to
get this information out to the public,'' he said. ``We know of at
least one patient who has died for no reason and we are going to
make sure that as best we can we don't let this happen to anyone
else.''

CHILLED CHAMPAGNE, DISCREET WAITERS AND THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN
THE PLACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
(One of a periodic series of stories on first loves). 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Love comes when it does, and its timetable does not bow to the
impatient.
</P>
<P>
   Love _ the real deal _ first came for me when I was 25. And that
is why I consider my first Valentine's Day to be Feb. 14, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand. By that time I had had all sorts of
crushes, sent roses, written my share of gooey, awful poetry, had
my heart broken by a high school girl named Mary, had an affair
with a married woman 10 years older than me (DUMB! VERY DUMB! DO
NOT DO THIS!) during my sophomore year in college, lived with a
woman, asked her to marry me, decided I didn't want to marry her
and, yes indeed, went to romantic restaurants on Valentines' Day. I
even remember a few of them.
</P>
<P>
   But I knew nothing, suspected nothing, about love until I met
Anita.
</P>
<P>
   She was amazingly gorgeous, amazingly interesting,
sophisticated, funny, seven years older than I, a fellow
journalist, and completely unattainable. Of course.
</P>
<P>
   We became friends, and I would go over to her apartment and
watch TV and eat pizza and, basically, worship her. And then one
night she was feeling sad, and I held her, and two nights later she
said, ``Well, aren't you EVER going to kiss me?''
</P>
<P>
   I did, and that was that. I was gone.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, on Christmas Eve, I said I loved her and she
said she loved me.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine my surprise.
</P>
<P>
   We were just besotted with each other, head over heels, couldn't
keep our hands ... you know. And it all seemed so incredibly,
impossibly EASY.
</P>
<P>
   We finished each other's sentences _ all the time. We found the
same things hilarious. We both loved old cemeteries and John Prine
and ``The Manchurian Candidate'' and French food and Burger King.
And her cats. And doing nothing on Sundays and taking long drives
to nowhere. She was the bee's knees, and then some.
</P>
<P>
   Words fail. Can a love that you think is true and forever and
THE ONE really be described? Whatever I say would be insufficient,
but suffice to say it was all that and a bag of chips. With a big
pickle on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's was coming up, and I chose a restaurant in Dallas;
moreover, I chose a little alcove in the restaurant. I didn't want
to be pitching the woo right next to some other guy pitching his
brand of woo. I consulted with some guy there about champagne. I
mentioned she liked extremely unobtrusive waiters. There was no
shame in my game, I'll tell you that.
</P>
<P>
   And then, the night before, we had a fight. A spat, let's say.
Nothing major, just one of those little bumps where the best thing
to do is get out of each other's faces for a day or two. So I did _
I went to see Aerosmith at Reunion Arena, where it occurred to me
that this was one of those activities I would probably always do on
my own.
</P>
<P>
   A gal has her limits, and Aerosmith was one of hers.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the next night I drove over to her place, knocked on the
door, and was met by her in the most beautiful little black dress.
We smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi.''
</P>
<P>
   All was well. Off we went.
</P>
<P>
   As you might expect, I remember the evening as being perfect.
There I was, walking into this room full of pretty women and their
dates, and I was with the most beautiful of all (and if you were
there that night, I'm sorry, but I stand by that opinion).
</P>
<P>
   We sat. The conversation flowed. She smiled and her eyes
sparkled and the food was delicious and the waiter (who was not, to
my relief, handsome) stayed at a discreet distance.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, she held my hand and held my gaze and said, ``You
know, I'm crazy about you.''
</P>
<P>
   At another, I remember, I saw a woman at another table looking
at us, and smiling. She can ``see it,'' I thought _ she can see how
much we love each other. When she turned back to her date, a
certain something left her eyes. She was back onstage.
</P>
<P>
   I floated out of there, far away from any worry, completely and
utterly content. This was the feeling I'd always wanted, the
valentine I had always wished I had.
</P>
<P>
   We loved each other, and for the first time in my life I felt as
though I had found a soul mate. I felt accepted. I felt complete.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship continued as I moved to South Texas, then back
to the Metroplex to work at the Star-Telegram and set up
housekeeping with her. Six months later, she moved to California;
we commuted for two years, seeing each other one weekend a month.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard and frustrating, tiring and hopeless, sometimes
great fun and always a holding pattern. I did everything I could to
find work where she was, couldn't, and finally realized that there
was something deeply wrong with our relationship, something we'd
lost over all those months of waiting and hoping and her finding
her voice and her place as a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   We both slowly pulled away. We both realized that there was
every possibility that this wouldn't end well. And I had a gnawing
feeling that if she loved me as much as I thought she did, she
would have stayed in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that's fair, I still don't know. But she had made that
choice, she was gone, I was here, and we were left with a
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   One night shortly after Christmas 1991, we were in a restaurant
in San Francisco, where we often went when I flew out to
California, and I asked her what was wrong. She snapped that she
didn't want to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, after a lot of silences, I flew home, unsettled,
not knowing what was going on, or how to make it better, or what to
say.
</P>
<P>
   A day or two later she called and said the relationship was
over. Just like that. I have not seen her since.
</P>
<P>
   She has married (for the second time) and continues to be one of
the best columnists I have ever read. Some part of me still loves
her, but I doubt that any part of her still loves me. I hope I
never see her face again.
</P>
<P>
   I hope she's happy. I'll never know.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't a sad story, or isn't meant to be. I have no
sweetie this Valentine's Day, and that's OK. I've had more good
Valentine's Days than bad ones, and sometimes a good one doesn't
necessarily mean being with someone.
</P>
<P>
   Anita and I were meant to last as long as we lasted, and she was
meant to get married and I wasn't _ for the time being, anyway. I
have nearly as many good memories as bad ones of our four years
together. Not everyone can say that of a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   And the good ones _ well, I get custody of those forever.
Especially of that night 12 years ago. A man can wait all his life
to sit across a table from a beautiful woman and see the love in
her eyes and feel as good as I did.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I will again. It's nice to think so. Love comes when it
does.

BELL ATLANTIC AND GTE TO SWAP OPERATIONS IN 13 STATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.,, Ind., Iowa, Nev., N.Y., Pa., Ala., Ariz., Fla., Ohio,
N.M., Texas, S.C.)  (jt) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first of several billion-dollar wireless telephone deals
that Bell Atlantic and GTE Corp. are likely to make early this
year, the two telecommunications giants announced Tuesday that they
would swap wireless operations in 13 states with Alltel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, the No. 2 local telephone company and one of the
nation's biggest wireless providers, has agreed to merge with GTE,
and the two companies have agreed to fold their combined U.S.
wireless unit into a joint venture with Vodafone Airtouch PLC of
Britain, the world's biggest wireless carrier.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's deal, Alltel agreed to exchange its interests in
wireless properties representing about 1 million customers in
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Nevada, New York and Pennsylvania for GTE
and Bell Atlantic units serving about 1.5 million customers in
Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Ohio, New Mexico, Texas and South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   To comply with federal regulations, the companies must divest
major overlapping parts of their wireless operations before either
deal can be completed.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Bell Atlantic, GTE and Vodafone must divest wireless
licenses covering almost a fifth of the nation's population _ about
45 million people. That created a big opportunity for Alltel, a
smaller communications carrier based in Little Rock, Ark., to
expand and fine-tune its network.
</P>
<P>
   ``This transaction is an innovative approach in finding
solutions to remain ahead of the competitive curve in the
fast-changing communications industry,'' Joe T. Ford, Alltel's
chairman, said in a statement. ``It enhances Alltel's geographic
market clusters and increases our customer base.''
</P>
<P>
   If the GTE-Bell Atlantic merger falls apart, GTE will be able to
back out of its part of the Alltel deal, which mostly covers
properties along the western coast of Florida from Tampa to
Pensacola and in the Cleveland area.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's deal would eliminate the license overlaps that stood
in the way of Bell Atlantic forming its joint venture with
Vodafone. But Bell Atlantic and GTE still have a long way to go
before they can complete their merger.
</P>
<P>
   Of the licenses covering 45 million people that stand in
conflict, Tuesday's deal would eliminate the overlaps covering only
about 14 million. Both companies are set to make additional deals
in the near future that could dwarf Tuesday's announcement. SBC
Communications Inc., the No. 1 local phone carrier, is among the
companies that may be interested in acquiring properties from Bell
Atlantic and GTE.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic's properties in the Southwest operate under the
Cellular One brand name. Those operations will change their brand
to Alltel, as will the GTE units included in the deal. Scott T.
Ford, Alltel's president, said Tuesday that his company would
continue to honor service contracts covering existing customers.

IN UNUSUAL MOVE, OVERSEAS ANGLICANS CONSECRATE 2 AMERICAN BISHOPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Pa.)   (bl)  
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a highly unusual challenge to the Episcopal Church's
leadership, the top officials of two Anglican church provinces
overseas _ in Africa and Asia _ have consecrated two conservative
American priests as bishops to minister to Episcopalians who feel
alienated from the denomination in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The action, which took place at a ceremony in Singapore last
Saturday, was taken without the knowledge or approval of the
Episcopal Church's top officer, Presiding Bishop Frank Griswold.
Bishops are elected by their own diocese and confirmed by the
church's other bishops.
</P>
<P>
   The consecrations, which might be likened to a county sheriff's
appointing a deputy to work in another county, led to questions
among church officials as to who would recognize these men as
having the authority of bishops.
</P>
<P>
   A statement released by the two new bishops said the
consecrations were intended to help ``lead the Episcopal Church
back to its biblical foundations,'' from which some conservatives
say it has strayed _ especially over such questions as the support
by some liberal bishops for ordaining gay men and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   The action represents a serious breach of protocol within the
worldwide Anglican Communion, an association of 38 church provinces
with more than 70 million members. The Episcopal Church is the
communion's American member. Griswold, in a letter to his church's
bishops, said he learned of the consecrations Monday and was
``appalled by this irregular action.''
</P>
<P>
   The two priests consecrated are the Rev. Charles H. Murphy III,
a parish rector in Pawley's Island, S.C., and the Rev. John H.
Rodgers Jr., a retired seminary president from Ambridge, Pa. The
ceremony took place in St. Andrew's Cathedral in Singapore, led by
Archbishop Emmanuel Kolini of the Province of Rwanda and Archbishop
Moses Tay of the Province of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Because the consecration was done outside Episcopal Church
procedures, the two men hold an ``irregular but valid'' status, as
prelates whose authority is not recognized within the area they
have said they will work, according to R. William Franklin, dean of
the Berkeley Divinity School at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   He said the two bishops could only be recognized for work within
the Episcopal Church by the church's General Convention, its
legislative body, which is scheduled to meet this summer. ``I think
the General Convention could pass a resolution condemning this
action,'' Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
   The consecrations come at a time of tension within the Anglican
Communion, particularly between older churches like the Episcopal
Church and the Church of England, which once sent thousands of
missionaries abroad, and the new, rapidly growing churches in
Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Amid these tensions, the Episcopal Church _ itself deeply
divided over issues of human sexuality _ has become a target for
criticism from some bishops in Africa and Asia who have said that
some of their counterparts in the United States, Canada and Britain
have become overly influenced by permissive Western society.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1998, conservative bishops from Africa and Asia, supported by
like-minded prelates in the United States and elsewhere, won a
symbolic victory at the once-a-decade Lambeth Conference of
Anglican bishops at Canterbury, England. The bishops voted
overwhelmingly to declare homosexuality to be ``incompatible with
Christian teaching.'' Afterward some bishops, many of them
Americans, openly registered their dissent from the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Anglicanism traces its roots to the Church of England's breaking
ties with the Roman Catholic Church in the 1530s. The communion
lacks any central authority like a pope.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin described the Singapore consecrations as ``absolutely
contrary to Anglican polity.'' Those involved ``see disorder within
the Episcopal Church and they think this action is a corrective
from the outside,'' he said. ``The danger,'' he added, ``is it
could lead to schism within a national church within which such
intervention takes place.''
</P>
<P>
   Another authority on the church, the Rev. Ian Douglas, a
professor of world mission and global Christianity at Episcopal
Divinity School in Cambridge, Mass., said the issue was less one of
sexuality than of power, as a long-term shift takes place between
the older Anglican churches and the growing, newer ones.
``Specifically,'' he said, ``who decides what is Anglican identity
and what is Anglican authority?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about it, the majority of Anglicans when I was
born 40 years ago, 70 percent lived in the industrialized West,''
Douglas said. ``By the year 2025, 70 percent will live in the
Southern Hemisphere.''
</P>
<P>
   The consecrations are provocative in their timing, coming only a
month before the primates _ the top leaders in each of the church
provinces _ are to meet in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Griswold sent a letter to his fellow primates saying he was
``profoundly disturbed'' by what he called ``the caricature'' of
the Episcopal Church as disregarding Scripture and doctrine,
contained in a statement by participants in the consecration
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The statement described the 2.4-million-member church as being
in crisis and suffering a decline in membership. It said the
consecration was not political, but was taken ``to re-establish the
unity that has been violated by the unrebuked ridicule and denial
of basic Christian teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement also said participants in the ceremony ``are
convinced it is time to give the faithful in the U.S. a place to
remain Anglican,'' and promised the two new bishops would offer
support and guidance to congregations that wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   Both men remained in Singapore on Tuesday and declined comment
through an American associate.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy is a founder of First Promise, a three-year-old
organization that says it is ``working for either the reformation
of the Episcopal Church or the emergence of an alternative,
orthodox Anglican Province.'' Rodgers, who served 17 years as dean
and president of Trinity Episcopal School for Ministry in
Cambridge, has been a leader in the Episcopalian ``renewal''
movement and helped found the National Organization of
Episcopalians for Life.

ELECTRONIC URGE TO PICK A WINNER OVERWHELMS 24-HOUR COMMENTATORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ All day long, as the voters of New Hampshire
pulled levers, the commentators on television dropped hints.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the talking heads even got their verb tenses
wrong, offering, in the hours before the polls closed, past-tense
reflections on how the candidates had done in an election that was
yet to be decided. But more often, they simply offered variations
on suspiciously similar themes.
</P>
<P>
   It happened on the Fox News Channel at about 4:15 p.m. EST, when
former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said of McCain, ``I think he's
going to surprise people and win by 8 to 12 points.''
</P>
<P>
   It happened an hour later on CNN's ``Inside Politics'' when Mary
Ann Marsh, a Democratic strategist, suggested the Democratic
contest ``might be a lot closer race than people think.''
</P>
<P>
   And it happened at 6 p.m. on MSNBC, when the NBC correspondent
Lisa Myers said on Andrea Mitchell's new political talk show that
one of the questions facing Gov. George W. Bush's campaign was
``how he faces a loss, particularly if he loses big.''
</P>
<P>
   What the news divisions were aware of all afternoon at these
networks _ as well as at newspapers like The New York Times _ was
that the first results of the exit surveys conducted by a
collectively-administered polling organization were showing McCain
was leading by a large margin, the Democrats were locked in a close
race and Bush was facing a big loss.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when most New Hampshire polls closed at 7 p.m., the
early hints were confirmed: Fox, MSNBC and CNN instantly called the
Republican race a resounding victory for McCain and the Democratic
contest ``too close to call.'' However, because some polls in the
state remained open until 8 p.m., local stations like
Manchester-based WMUR-TV, an ABC affiliate and the dominant New
Hampshire news station, took the position that the races should not
be called until the voting ended. So they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   News organizations, of course, rely greatly on the data gathered
in interviews with voters at the polling places to determine how to
cover the impending returns on election-night broadcasts and in the
next morning's front pages. But in a day's worth of channel
surfing, one got the impression of a champing at the bit across the
airwaves, an electronic urge to give viewers a real-time assessment
of an election day-in-progress.
</P>
<P>
   Coverage of the Alaska Airlines crash in the Pacific competed
with political updates throughout the day. Still, the all-news
cable channels _ the emerging dominant force in campaign coverage
on television this year _ filled several hours before the polls
closed with stories and commentary that went beyond the traditional
boundaries of voting-day stories. Along with the usual reports
citing heavy voter turnout and the first-in-the-state returns from
Dixville Notch, these highly competitive channels came very close
to calling the races.
</P>
<P>
   How much attention New Hampshire voters paid to the glut of
horse-race reportage and prognostication in the final days of the
election is unclear. In Tuesday's exit poll conducted by the Voter
News Service, about two out of 10 Republican voters said they
decided over the last three days which lever they would pull. As
for other media influences, about a third of those who voted for
Democrats said that the candidates' commercials affected their
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   As they left their polling place at a high school in Londonderry
on Tuesday, several voters said the news media in general and
television news in particular had helped them make their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the media said that independents could make a difference,
that got me out to vote,'' said John Bartlett, who described
himself as a political independent who usually votes for Democrats.
Tuesday, however, he voted for McCain, and he cited the polls as a
motivating factor. ``The closer Bush got to McCain, the more I
wanted to vote,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bethany Gordon, an 18-year-old student at Londonderry High
School and a supporter of Bill Bradley, said she interpreted the
recent coverage of the Democratic campaign as reflecting poorly on
Vice President Al Gore. ``I heard it, and I believed it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Pat Sheridan, a retired newspaper pressman, said he came to
the opposite conclusion from television coverage. ``It played a big
part,'' he said, in explaining how he decided to vote for Gore.
``The worst thing that came across the television is how weak
Bradley comes across.''
</P>
<P>
   Election night on television was markedly different from eight
days earlier, in Iowa, where a desultory evening of reporting
lacked much snap. Tuesday night, however, the anchors seemed more
convinced themselves of their repeated pronouncements that the
evening's developing story, the prospect of a continuing race on
both sides, was ``exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are preparing here for a bruising five weeks,'' declared
John King, CNN's correspondent at Gore's campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   His CNN colleague, Judy Woodruff, betrayed a slight case of
guilt over the breathless pace of declaring winners before all the
voters had their say.

VALUE CITY ACQUISITION OF FILENES'S BASEMENT SEEN POSSIBLE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   An analyst who follows Value City Department Stores Inc. issued
says it might make strategic sense for the Ohio chain to acquire
Filene's Basement Corp. of Wellesley, Mass., the retailer that has
been operating under bankruptcy protection since August.
</P>
<P>
   Value City and Filene's Basement declined to comment, but
industry speculation about Value City buying all or part of
Filene's Basement has grown so widespread that David Mann, an
analyst with Johnson Rice in New Orleans, said he decided to issue
a brief report about a possible acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe the industry speculation,'' said Mann, who added
that such a sale would be consistent with Value City's
``opportunistic'' acquisition strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney who represents Filene's Basement's unsecured
creditors committee confirmed that Value City and Filene's Basement
have been in talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiations have taken place and negotiations continue,''
said Jay Indyke, an attorney with the New York law firm of Kronish
Lieb Weiner &AMP; Hellman, who declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Known as off-price retailers that sell designer goods at a
discount, Value City and Filene's Basement offer similar
merchandise to similar customers, Mann said. In many cases, the two
chains buy from the same vendors, and Value City has a history of
expanding through buying up distressed retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Filene's Basement in recent years, Value City has managed
to make the off-price retail formula work.
</P>
<P>
   For its third quarter, Value City earned $7.7 million on sales
of $441.3 million. At stores open for at least a year, often a
strong measure of a retailer's health, Value City said sales rose
11.1 percent. Filene's Basement, meanwhile, has lost money in four
of the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   A Value City spokesman declined to comment about a possible
sale, saying, ``We regularly look at opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Filene's Basement spokeswoman Nancy Sterling said, ``Because we
are in Chapter 11, we are required to communicate with anyone who
approaches us about a possible affiliation.''
</P>
<P>
   She declined to elaborate further.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Columbus, Ohio, Value City operates just over 100
off-price department stores in the Midwest and the South as well as
in states as far east as New Jersey. It reported roughly $1.36
billion in sales for its latest fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Operating more than 50 stores when it filed for Chapter 11,
Filene's Basement since has announced plans to close about 35
stores and lay off about 1,300 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Filene's Basement had annual sales of about $588 million; when
it recently announced store closings, it projected annual sales of
around $350 million.

ORIGIN OF AIDS TRACED TO 1930 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.M., Pa.)  (jw) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Using a new statistical method and one of the
world's most powerful computers, scientists at the Los Alamos
National Laboratory said Tuesday that they had traced the origin of
the AIDS epidemic to around 1930, nearly 30 years before the
earliest known infection in humans.
</P>
<P>
   The virus could have originated from 1910 to 1950, but 1930
seems the most probable date based on calculations of the AIDS
virus' family tree and the rate at which the virus mutated over
time, Dr. Bette Korber, the head of the research team, told the
Seventh Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections
here.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists generally believe that HIV-1, the AIDS virus, evolved
from a virological cousin in chimpanzees that jumped species to
humans.
</P>
<P>
   The 1930 date ``does not necessarily mark the point where a
chimp bit a man,'' Korber said, because the chimpanzee virus could
have been introduced into humans many times earlier without further
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Korber said that the epidemic, which has infected 40 million
people worldwide, presumably had its origins in one or a small
group of humans around 1930. But, she added, ``there is no way to
know'' whether the original HIV-1 from 1930 came from a human or
chimpanzee or whether the earliest infections caused illness.
</P>
<P>
   The new research sets back by about 15 years an earlier estimate
of the World War II period as the time of the origin of HIV-1. The
earlier estimate was based on the earliest known isolation of
HIV-1. It came from blood collected in 1959 from a man in what was
then Belgian Congo and kept since then.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings also challenge a theory advanced by Edward
Hooper, a British journalist, in his book ``The River,'' that the
AIDS epidemic was inadvertently brought on when the chimpanzee
virus got into an experimental polio vaccine tested in the Belgian
Congo in the late 1950s and prepared at the Wistar Institute in
Philadelphia or laboratories in Belgium and the Belgian Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Korber told reporters that Hooper's thesis was unlikely but that
she would not rule it out.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a committee appointed by the Wistar Institute urged it
to find other laboratories to test the tiny amount of polio vaccine
Wistar had kept stored for more than 40 years. The tests were not
carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Now at least three laboratories will test the stored polio
vaccine that Dr. Stanley Plotkin and Dr. Hilary Koprowski of the
Wistar Institute tested in the Belgian Congo, Plotkin said at a
news conference at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Plotkin said he was not at liberty to name the laboratories and
expressed hope that their findings would be reported by May when
the Royal Society in London plans to hold a scientific meeting on
the contaminated polio vaccine controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Korber said that her team, which included her husband, James
Theiler, a statistical astronomer, had worked for nearly two years
to develop a new method to analyze genetic information from the
virus DNA of infected people. The Los Alamos laboratory has
collected such information for HIV vaccine and other research
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos researchers have used the genetic mutations of
HIV that have occurred over time to create HIV family trees. The
aim is to help learn the origins of AIDS and better ``understand
the speed with which the virus accumulates mutations,'' Korber
said.
</P>
<P>
   The team developed computer codes that correlate distances
between branches in the HIV family tree to extrapolate back to the
origin of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Each branch in the immense tree represented a change in HIV. The
branching was based on calculations performed with the
supercomputer on specific portions of DNA from HIV isolated from
1980 to 1989. Korber said the supercomputer was indispensable for
dating the origin of HIV-1.
</P>
<P>
   In another study reported Tuesday, researchers found that oral
sex accounted for a larger than expected number of new HIV
infections among gay men in San Francisco in the three years from
June 1996 through June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 102 participants in the study, 85 percent said they did
not use condoms for oral sex because they believed that it
represented either no or minimal risk in transmitting HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Oral sex has a much lower risk of transmitting HIV than
intercourse. Some men who substituted only oral sex for anal sex to
limit their risk ``felt burned'' when they learned they still had
become infected, said Dr. Frederick Hecht, an author of the study
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the
University of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding ejaculation did not eliminate the risk, Hecht said.

PACEMAKERS HAVE COME A LONG WAY FROM THEIR BIRTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eleven-year-old Sarah Burkett had no clue that her heartbeat was
dangerously slow _ less than 40 beats per minute _ when she went to
her pediatrician last fall for the routine physical required to
play sixth-grade basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say her heart most likely always lagged behind (normal
rate is 70-80) _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   She received a pacemaker at Cook Children's Medical Center in
Fort Worth last month, and immediately her heart rate rose to
normal. She was eager to get back to school and back to the sports
she loves _ basketball and volleyball especially _ as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   A pacemaker regulates heartbeats that are either too slow or
irregular by stimulating the heart muscle with precisely timed
discharges of electricity. The electrical impulses are produced by
a lithium-battery-powered pulse generator connected to flexible
wire leads that transmit the impulses down into the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah's pacemaker certainly won't limit her. In fact, she should
have more energy and stamina, says Dr. Paul Gillette, the pediatric
cardiologist who implanted her pacemaker on a Tuesday and
discharged her that Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Once a medical novelty, pacemakers today regulate the heartbeats
of 500,000 Americans: bouncing babies, active children,
professional baseball players, middle-aged joggers and a lot of
senior citizens, including Byron Nelson and Dale Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Another 200,000 Americans have implantable
cardioverter-defibrillators, which also function as pacemakers.
(The defibrillator constantly monitors the heart and shocks it back
into normal rhythm when it starts to race out of control or quiver
uselessly.)
</P>
<P>
   With the aging of the baby boomers, the number of people relying
on pacemakers to keep up a healthy heart rate is expected to
increase dramatically. Some pacemakers correct abnormal rhythms
present at birth, like Sarah's, but the majority are implanted in
older people. Their heart muscles most often were damaged by a
heart attack, coronary artery disease, infection, surgery, certain
medications, abnormalities in the level of blood minerals or
hormones, a virus, diabetes or other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette, medical director of pediatric cardiology at Cook
Children's Medical Center, has implanted pacemakers in babies on
the day they were born; Dr. Wade McBride, the electrophysiologist
who implanted a pacemaker in Gillette's chest two years ago, has
placed implants in patients as old as 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of patients today are a decade older than when I
went through training,'' says McBride, who specializes in
cardiac-rhythm disorders. ``Now most are in their 70s. They are
healthier later in life, and they don't require a pacemaker as
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   When young children require pacemakers it is usually because
their hearts were scarred before birth, often because the mother
has lupus or a lupuslike disease that produces antibodies that
damage the heart's tissue, or because of open-heart surgery to
correct life-threatening congenital defects.
</P>
<P>
   The heartbeat irregularity that necessitated Gillette's
pacemaker is related to a family history of heart block and to
bypass surgery five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pacemakers were developed in the late 1950s. Some produce
electrical impulses continuously, and others are designed to
trigger impulses whenever the heart rate drops too low.
</P>
<P>
   The original pacemaker was a bulky, external device with wires
extending from the chest to a thing that looked like a battery
charger that you rolled around, Gillette says.
</P>
<P>
   The first reports of successfully implanted pacemakers were
published in 1960, according to a company history provided by
Medtronic, now the largest pacemaker manufacturer in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years the implantable pacemaker has been improved with
long-life batteries, and the size and weight have been greatly
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest change in the last three to five years has been in
pacemaker diagnostics _ what all the pacemaker can tell us about
what's happening to the heart, if there are any rapid rhythms,''
McBride says. ``In the past we didn't get much information. Now the
pacemaker can record information just like a halter monitor and
print it out so we can see exactly what's happening. It also helps
us monitor the leads so we can see if there is any malfunction or
damage to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The other big change is in sensors that help the pacemaker
respond to what's happening _ in terms of both activity and
respiration. The pacemaker's computer integrates the two and
responds to either or both.
</P>
<P>
   Pacemakers that were activity-responsive were introduced in the
late '60s, but they sensed only movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it felt vibrations, it went faster, but it required
movement to sense that it needed to go faster,'' McBride explains.
``The new technology also watches a patient's breathing pattern.
When you are breathing faster or deeper or harder, the sensors
detect that as physiologic stress, so the pacemaker increases the
heart rate even when there is no motion. If you are reading a good
book, and your breathing becomes harder, your heart beat goes up,
just as it would naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's pacemakers are the world's smallest programmable
computers, built on a microchip roughly four-tenths of 1 square
inch.
</P>
<P>
   ``With battery, they are about the size of two 50-cent pieces
strapped together,'' Gillette says. ``The defibrillators are much
larger _ a little bigger than a deck of cards _ and more expensive
than a pacemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacemakers cost about $7,000, defibrillators with pacemakers
about $27,000.
</P>
<P>
   Implanting a pacemaker in an adult is often an outpatient
procedure, requiring less than 24 hours in the hospital or clinic.
In most cases, children are given general anesthesia and spend a
couple of days in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Pacemaker leads are threaded intravenously through a catheter
down into the heart, and open-chest surgery is not required. The
only incision involved is a tiny slit under the shoulder bone,
where the battery and circuitry are placed. They appear as a small
bulge just under the skin and often cannot be seen at all in
adults.
</P>
<P>
   Patients can be monitored by phone after they have received
implants, simply by dialing a clinic number every two to three
months and holding the phone over their chests.

ILLINOIS REPRIEVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Illinois Governor George Ryan is restoring some justice to his
criminal justice system by calling a moratorium on executions after
it became clear that 13 death row inmates had been wrongly
convicted in his state. All 13 were set free.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that other states with the death penalty are any
less vulnerable to the coerced confessions, mistaken
identifications, fabricated testimony, incompetence, or bias that
led Illinois juries to send the wrong men to death row. Since 1986,
a legal rights group called the Innocence Project has secured the
release of more than 60 convicts nationwide who were cleared by DNA
and other new evidence. Since 1973, when the United States revived
capital punishment, 85 convictions have been overturned in 21
states, from Oklahoma to Florida to California.
</P>
<P>
   What sets Illinois apart is that it is one of only two states _
New York is the other _ that gives inmates the time and resources
needed for post-conviction DNA testing. That right, and the
dedicated work of Northwestern University law students who helped
free nine men from death row, should shame the nation's
legislatures into adopting similar bans on executions until the
public can be assured that justice is administered evenly.
Moratorium bills are pending in 12 states.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of good reasons to oppose the death penalty: It
is not a deterrent to violent crime; it is applied
disproportionately by race and income; regional differences make it
160 times more likely that a convict in the South will be put to
death than one in the Northeast. But no reason is more compelling
than the finality of a system in which deadly errors can never be
taken back, staining the hands of us all.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Ryan is a Republican who supports the death penalty and
still believes it can be designed to operate fairly. But he is
right when he calls the state's execution of an innocent person
``the ultimate nightmare.'' It is past time for the country to wake
up from its retributive trance and banish the demons of brutality
and error.

`BIG DIG' HIGHWAY REVAMP GETS $1.4B MORE EXPENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS C. PALMER JR.  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Big Dig officials announced Tuesday the largest
increase yet in the cost of the massive highway project _ a
breathtaking $1.4 billion jump, which will bring the total to $12.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement _ which will likely force motorists to swallow
sooner-than-expected toll increases _ ends officials' six-year
insistence that costs would not exceed $10.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.4 billion revision, primarily due to unforeseen growth in
scores of multimillion-dollar construction contracts, includes a
$750 million shortage of cash needed to keep the project going next
year, according to James J. Kerasiotes, chairman of the
Massachusetts Turnpike Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Kerasiotes said the dramatic spike in costs on the Central
Artery/Ted Williams Tunnel project was discovered after the current
director, Patrick J. Moynihan, launched an examination of remaining
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him to take a top-to-bottom review,'' said Kerasoites,
who has overseen the Big Dig almost since construction began in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage could present a political problem for the Cellucci
administration, which is pushing a $1.1 billion income tax cut and
has touted its smooth management of the Big Dig.
</P>
<P>
   The funding problem may also invite additional attacks from
congressional critics of the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question it's a serious situation,'' said Rep.
Joseph Sullivan, cochairman of the Legislature's transportation
committee. ``And the approach that's preferable is to await a plan
the Turnpike should offer.''
</P>
<P>
   The first official estimate completed by the Weld
administration, after the project was assumed from the Dukakis
administration, was $5.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Kerasiotes is briefing legislative leaders on the problem this
week. He said all the increased costs will be borne _ though
details that have not yet been worked out _ by the Turnpike
authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an issue that will affect the state's bond cap or
credit,'' Kerasiotes said in a quickly arranged interview. ``The
Turnpike has always approached this issue as one the Turnpike will
manage.''
</P>
<P>
   After refusing for months to talk about costs that many familiar
with the project saw mounting dramatically, Kerasiotes and Moynihan
said they decided to address the issue Tuesday because the state
will be borrowing money shortly for other capital projects.
</P>
<P>
   Questions were being raised about whether increased costs on the
Big Dig would affect the state's ability to borrow, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerasiotes pledged he would work with the Legislature to solve
the cash shortage early next year, including revising the toll
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Turnpike tolls are already scheduled to increase in 2002,
including a doubling of the 50-cent toll on the Turnpike extension,
but those hikes ``could be accelerated,'' he said. Kerasiotes said
that by fall he will present a detailed plan to cover the needed
$750 million.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively sudden admission of a large potential cost
increase comes at a critical time.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Transportation's inspector general is
preparing to issue a report estimating the Big Dig's costs as high
as $11.8 billion. Project officials took issue with that figure
when it appeared in a draft report in the fall _ but their own
revelations Tuesday exceeded even that estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Big Dig officials warned that even this assessment of future
costs is not complete _ but they expressed confidence that $12.2
billion is sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   They said they are optimistic that a significant portion of the
$1.4 billion increase outlined Tuesday can be eventually recouped
through the sale of project assets, such as the Massachusetts
Highway Building, now the Big Dig's headquarters, and the lease of
air rights on development property downtown and in neighborhing
Charlestown.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan and Kerasiotes said that project officials would
continue to look for ways to hold costs down, though Kerasiotes
said that as the project nears completion, ``Scope reduction have
become less and less of a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Mead, the inspector general of the US Department of
Transportation, and his staff have been locked in a war of words
with the Big Dig over the pending audit's conclusions, specifically
over how the Big Dig uses federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the exchange said Moynihan wrote a letter
so angry and insulting to the inspector general's staff in October
that it has poisoned the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Highway Administration's regional office, which is
closely involved in managing the Big Dig, has supported state
officials in their use of the funds.
</P>
<P>
   John Birtwell, a spokesman for Cellucci, said he did not believe
the governor had been briefed on the new cost increase figures yet.
But he said, ``The stewardship of the Big Dig has been superb.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Cellucci's staff would be meeting with Kerasiotes over
the next week.
</P>
<P>
   The voracious needs of the highway, bridge, and tunnel
megaproject have been leaving only crumbs on the table for the
state's non-Artery highway and bridge program, according to local
officials and industry sources.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated claims that the state is spending $600 million
or so on non-Artery highway projects, they say, a number of
accounting changes and wholesale delays in work have meant that
only a fraction of the local projects have actually been
undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   The Turnpike has committed itself to contribute about $1.3
billion to the Big Dig. Kerasiotes said the entire outlay of state
dollars for the project, not counting the use of federal highway
dollars that come to the state annually, amounts to only about $800
so far.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the state's contribution to the Big Dig is through its
advance borrowing of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal
transportation allocations that are not due to the state a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its fiscal problems, in most respects the project has
been a success. Though it began several years later than planned,
it is roughly on track to be completed on time, early in 2005.

TAXPAYERS' TAB FOR GUARDING BUSH: $2.6 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas taxpayers last year paid more than $2.6
million to protect Gov. George W. Bush _ more than 10 times the
average amount spent in the years before he began running for
president, figures released on Tuesday show.
</P>
<P>
   The new figure, provided by the Department of Public Safety, is
almost $1 million higher than the figure released in November. That
figure included expenses though late October, meaning the DPS has
been spending about $500,000 a month on executive security since
that time.
</P>
<P>
   Figures for January, a busy month on the campaign trail, were
not available. DPS officials also noted that some of the 1999
expenses have not been paid, so the figure could go higher.
</P>
<P>
   The expenses have come under fire from Democrats and watchdog
groups, who point to the Republican governor's large campaign war
chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the governor deserves protection, but not at the
expense of the taxpayer,'' said Molly Beth Malcolm, chair of the
state Democratic Party. ``He seems to be compassionate when it
comes to himself, but that's sure not being very conservative with
the taxpayers' money.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in a recent interview, defended the arrangement, saying
other governors enjoyed DPS protection when they left the state.
Aides pointed out that Ann Richards received DPS protection when
she left Texas to campaign for Bill Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the charge of the DPS. That's been the tradition of the
DPS. Other governor's have left the state, and that's their
responsibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.65 million figure in 1999 compares with $285,874 spent to
provide executive security in 1998, a year in which Bush ran for
re-election. The annual average between 1995 and 1997 was about
$168,000.
</P>
<P>
   Though the security costs provided by DPS include expenses for
Lt. Gov. Rick Perry _ who gets a security detail when Bush leaves
the state _ a Bush spokeswoman acknowledged that the overwhelming
majority of the expenses involved providing security for the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Suzy Woodford, director of Common Cause, a government watchdog
group, said the state should provide security for the governor but
that Bush should pay part of the tab.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think it would be unseemly to say we think he should
reimburse the state for at least part of the cost,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the success of his campaign, Bush could soon
receive Secret Service protection, which presumably would reduce
the need for a large DPS detail. The Treasury Department, which
oversees the Secret Service, makes the determination on when
``major'' presidential candidates become eligible for federal
protection.

&HT;     PENTAGON ISSUES RULES TO PROTECT GAYS FROM HARASSMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon issued tough new rules Tuesday aimed
at preventing harassment of homosexuals in the military while, at
the same time, releasing figures showing a decline in the number of
service members ousted because they are gay.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, chief spokesman for Defense Secretary William
Cohen, said that in fiscal year 1999, which ended Sept. 30, the
four branches of the military discharged 1,034 homosexuals compared
with 1,145 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The main thrust of the new guidelines is that if troops report
harassment or threats based on their perceived sexual orientation,
commanders are to make sure investigations focus on the complaints
rather than the complainants.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said the rules on how to
investigate alleged anti-gay threats have been incorporated in
updated training programs designed to ensure that the Clinton
</P>
<P>
   administration's don't-ask-don't-tell-don't-pursue policy on
gays is enforced fairly and uniformly throughout the services.
</P>
<P>
   The rules spelling out the policy that commanders are not to use
complaints of anti-gay actions as a reason to investigate the
</P>
<P>
   complainants say that instead the source of the threat or
harassment is to be probed.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said in a written statement that ``these plans make it
very clear ... that there is no room for harassment or threats in
the military.'' He added, ``Service members need to understand that
harassment for any reason will not be tolerated, and commanders
will take prompt, appropriate actions against individuals involved
in such behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   A gay rights leader, Michelle Benecke, co-executive director of
the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, gave cautious approval of
the new Pentagon approach. The don't-ask-don't-tell-don't pursue
policy that President Clinton and Congress agreed to in 1993 was
put into effect the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's high time that military leaders began training people in
the field,'' she said. ``What's needed now is for leaders to
implement today's guidance with commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, `` We deal with service members every day who have no
place to go inside the military if they are harassed. This guidance
is way overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Benecke, whose organization provides legal aid to gays
in the military, said that if the commanders follow the new rules,
``I'd expect to see the discharge numbers decrease in more
significant ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Benecke said the overall drop in the number of discharges in
1999 from the 1998 figure is not indicative of an improving trend
for gays and lesbians in the service. ``The fact is that under
don't-ask-don't-tell-don't-pursue the military continues to kick
three people out every day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The new Pentagon rules attempt to address the harassment
concerns of gay groups that have long charged that if service
members complain of anti-gay harassment, then they will become the
target of an investigation into their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters and Gen. Michael Ryan,
also issued a statement saying that ``harassment, threats or
ridicule of individuals or groups based upon their real or
perceived differences, including sexual orientation, have no place
in the United States Air Force and will not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Under current Pentagon policy, homosexual activity is banned in
the military, but gays and lesbians may serve as long as they keep
quiet about their sexual orientation and aren't
</P>
<P>
   caught engaging in homosexual acts.
</P>
<P>
   While commanders may not inquire into a service member's sexual
orientation generally, they may do so if they have ``credible
information'' that the member engages in homosexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines stem from outrage over the baseball-bat
killing last year at Fort Campbell, Ky., of an Army recruit, Pvt.
Barry Winchell, 21, who was believed to be gay. In December, Pvt.
Calvin Glover, 19, was sentenced to life in prison for the murder.
</P>
<P>
   According to a breakdown of the gay-dismissal figures, the Air
Force outpaced the other military services last year, letting go
352 troops compared with 414 in 1998, 309 in 1997, 282 in 1996, 234
in 1995 and 180 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy released 314 sailors in 1999, compared with 345 in
1998, 413 in 1997, 302 in 1996, 260 in 1995 and 245 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Army discharged 271 homosexuals in 1999 compared with 310 in
1998, 197 in 1997, 206 in 1996, 182 in 1995 and 136 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps, the smallest military branch, released 97
homosexuals in 1999 compared with 76 in 1998, 78 in 1997, 60 in
1996, 46 in 1995 and 36 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said 83.5 percent of the 1999 ousters resulted from
individuals voluntarily coming forward to admit they were gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We maintain that we aren't coercing people to make these
statements,'' Bacon said at a news conference. ``And we maintain
that, in fact, the policies have changed to become much clearer
about not harassing people to make statements.''

BENETTON SHOWS ITS TRUE COLORS ON DEATH PENALTY
</HEADLINE>
 (Duplication Alert: Story being filed in ``a'' general and ``k''
commentary categories).

<TEXT>
<P>
   So I buy the new issue of the much-hyped ``Talk'' magazine, the
one with Leonardo on the cover, and tear off the clear plastic
wrapping, briefly wondering why there IS clear plastic wrapping,
and discover a second magazine behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, On Death Row'' is the title on the cover with a photo of a
man dressed in red, against a wall, a beam of sunlight shining on
his pudgy frame.
</P>
<P>
   Gosh, I think. This doesn't LOOK like a model, leggy and
waif-skinny or buff, even though there's a United Colors of
Benetton label just to the guy's left.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, we aren't selling clothes here. Inside are brief
interviews with 26 Death Row inmates, prefaced by quotes from the
Dalai Lama, Pope John Paul II and some of the convicts themselves.
Each criminal is shown in a full-page portrait alongside his or her
interview, many in close-up.
</P>
<P>
   Heroin chic, Kosovo chic and now _ murderer chic?
</P>
<P>
   What's up with that?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's not that simple. A little phone work _ I start
in New York, am referred to Washington, D.C., and then back to New
York _ finally has me on the line to Italy, chatting with Sederico
Sartor, the unfailingly nice chief press officer of Benetton Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, On Death Row,'' he says, was published to raise the
profile of the debate on capital punishment. The idea was suggested
by Benetton art director Oliviero Toscani, who spent three years
photographing the inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate on capital punishment is very important around the
world,'' says Sartor. ``It's not linked to the U.S. political
situation, the elections.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk'' is the only magazine that will include the Benetton
Death Row supplement. ``It's a young, aggressive magazine, and
Oliviero is a consultant'' are the reasons Sartor gives. But the
images also will be in magazine ads, newspapers and on billboards
worldwide for several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether or not capital punishment should be
allowed in a developed country or in any country,'' Sartor says,
``and if another type of punishment should be used or not.''
</P>
<P>
   But the campaign appears to answer this question, and to be more
than a little forgiving of the inmates photographed. The
information on the crimes is extremely brief (''first degree
murder'' or ``four counts first degree murder, aggravated arson''
are as much as we get) and the questions posed to the inmates might
best be described as softballs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Beoria Abraham Simmons II, on Death Row since 1985
for three murders, is asked, ``Where would you like to go, if you
could go somewhere?'' and ``Were hunting and fishing the most
enjoyable things you did?'' He talks about being a preacher, about
the size of the bass he caught, about being caught speeding, about
having no fear of death, and what time he woke up that morning.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing _ NOTHING _ about the three people he killed _
the circumstances, how much the people suffered, their ages, their
relationship to him, how he felt then, if he was on drugs, and _
most important to me _ if he feels any remorse.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true pretty much across the board. Jeremy Sheets
(first-degree murder, use of knife in commission of a felony) chats
about being in the Navy (''I really enjoyed it''); Carlette Parker
(first-degree murder, kidnapping) admits she doesn't like animals
or little kids and says she'd like to give her father a hug; and
David Leroy Skaggs (first-degree murder, two counts) talks about
his abusive father and what is wrong with the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``S-I-N. S-I-N'' is his answer.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I should say so.
</P>
<P>
   To me _ and I'm not a try-'em-and-fry-'em guy, by any means _
the tone of ``We, On Death Row'' is clearly sympathetic to these
people. Too sympathetic. It is made clear, over and over, that
these people just don't LIKE being in prison, that they miss the
pleasures found outside the walls, that they would like to get out.
</P>
<P>
   Sartor waffles when asked about how easy the questions are. One
minute, he's saying that they weren't asked about their crimes
because ``we focused on the human being and what they are now ...''
The next, he's practically admitting that the supplement is
anti-capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with some people who say our position is against the
death penalty,'' he says. ``That's only because in our country we
haven't had the death penalty for years.''
</P>
<P>
   So the slant is not, it would seem, to simply ``raise the debate
about the issue.'' Whatever its intentions, ``We, On Death Row''
reads like ``Get to Know Some Killers'' while reinforcing how
unhappy they are to be in such a horrible place.
</P>
<P>
   No, Benetton isn't selling clothes here (Sartor laughs when I
ask him if Benetton is developing a line of clothing based on
prison garb, and if so will the inmates in the photos be modeling
it).
</P>
<P>
   No, no, he says, the 7,000 stores the company has worldwide do
more than enough business.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure they do.

ANTHOLOGY CAPTURES BLACK POETS' VOICES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My earliest memory of poetry comes from an Easter Sunday when I
was a girl reciting speeches and Bible verses.
</P>
<P>
   Other times, rhymes spilled from my oldest brother's mouth _
``shine, shine save po' me'' _ or from my grandmother, who filled
us with laughter.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until I was much older that I was formally introduced
to poetry, but even then, with the exception of Phyllis Wheatly and
James Weldon Johnson, the writers never looked like me.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, though, I discovered Langston Hughes, Countee
Cullen, Claude McKay, Arna Bontemps, Nikki Giovanni, Maya Angelou
and Gwendolyn Brooks. Before long, the rhythmic power of their
words captivated me, held me spellbound to my chair or bed or
wherever I settled to be with them.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at their faces staring back at me from book covers, I
couldn't help but wonder what their voices might sound like. If
they were deep like rivers or shrill, like chalk against a
blackboard.
</P>
<P>
   And now I have them all. Captured on CDs. Speaking to me.
</P>
<P>
   The two-piece anthology, ``Our Souls Have Grown Deep Like the
Rivers: Black Poets Read Their Work,'' was released Jan. 18 by
Rhino/Word Beat just in time for Black History Month. The
collection spans 80 years _ 1919 to 1999 _ and features selections
culled from albums, radio programs, Library of Congress recordings
and readings staged in clubs, colleges and museums.
</P>
<P>
   It opens appropriately with Hughes' ``The Negro Speaks of
Rivers'' _ the inspiration for the title of the collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known rivers:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow
of human blood in human veins.
</P>
<P>
   ``My soul has grown deep like the rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I built my hut in the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln went
down to New Orleans, and I've seen its muddy bosom turn all golden
in the sunset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known rivers:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ancient, dusky rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My soul has grown deep like the rivers.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the leaders of the Harlem Renaissance, ``Our
Souls'' also offers voices from popular culture such as Public
Enemy and representatives of the new generation of slam poets.
</P>
<P>
   All of it reflects the rich oral tradition of the
African-American community with cadences echoing the street and
church.
</P>
<P>
   The voice of W.E.B. DuBois comes to mind. Recounting the year
(1897) he went to Atlanta and the lynchings that occurred there, he
sounds like some Baptist preacher from my Southern past.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I was there, my faith in knowledge as a solution of the
Negro problem was shaken,'' DuBois said.
</P>
<P>
   He concluded that it wasn't enough for people to know what was
right. They had to act.
</P>
<P>
   As poet Al Young says, poetry is more than words on a page. It
is about human beings: voices, emotions, feelings, thoughts and
rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Nikki Giovanni's ``I Am She:''
</P>
<P>
   ``i was a Daughter of Eve
</P>
<P>
   ``Who gathered sugar plums and knowledge
</P>
<P>
   ``In the garden with the sons of Adam
</P>
<P>
   ``i was a Queen of the Nile
</P>
<P>
   ``Where i napped in the shadows of Kings' tombs
</P>
<P>
   ``And worshipped light
</P>
<P>
   ``i was a poor mistrodden maiden
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knelt upon the ground and kissed the feet
</P>
<P>
   ``Of hope and eternity
</P>
<P>
   ``i was a wife of a warrior
</P>
<P>
   ``Who fought to save mother Earth
</P>
<P>
   ``So we might rise unto the great spirit
</P>
<P>
   ``i was a mother of a leader
</P>
<P>
   ``Of a people who were brave and free
</P>
<P>
   ``And stood for liberty and justice
</P>
<P>
   ``I AM SHE
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cries out in pain and joy and triumph
</P>
<P>
   ``For all that is tomorrow and was yesterday
</P>
<P>
   ``And will be forever''

PENTAGON ORDERS TRAINING SESSIONS TO PREVENT ANTI-GAY HARASSMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Every member of the armed forces, from four-star
generals to privates, will undergo training by the end of the year
to prevent anti-gay harassment, the Pentagon announced on Tuesday
in a sweeping admission that its ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy
is poorly understood in the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the murder of a gay private in Kentucky last
July, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen ordered each of the
armed services to prepare training programs and asked the senior
civilian and military leaders of the Army, Navy, Air Force and
Marines to send letters to their commanders this month underlining
that anti-gay threats and harassment will not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this does is try to make the training more regular and to
emphasize, from the top down, that this is a priority of all the
services and to make this emphasis stronger and clearer than it was
before,'' said Kenneth H. Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   While the ``don't ask, don't tell, don't harass'' policy is five
years old, the armed forces has never made it a subject for
universal training of its members, nor has the Pentagon sent out
messages to the field specifically ordering full compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Although the policy appears straightforward _ that gay and
lesbian members may serve in the military so long as they keep
their sexual orientation to themselves and do not engage in
homosexual acts _ the military has been plagued with instances of
gays being harassed until they admitted their sexual orientation,
ending their military careers.
</P>
<P>
   Gay and lesbian military activists applauded the new policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory to finally have this training and to have
this message sent out to the field but it's a shame it took the
murder of a private at Fort Campbell to get them to do this,'' said
Michelle Benecke, co-director of the Servicemembers Legal Defense
Network, which has lobbied for the changes.
</P>
<P>
   It also took the intervention of presidential politics.
President Clinton said in a radio interview in December that the
military's policy was ``out of whack'' following the conviction of
an Army private in the murder of Pfc. Barry Winchell in their
barracks at Fort Campbell, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Within days Vice President Al Gore called for the outright
elimination of the policy. which was already the position of former
Sen. Bill Bradley, his rival for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also announced on Tuesday that the number of
service members discharged because they were homosexuals dropped in
the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30 _ to 1,034 from 1,145 the
year before.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the new, nearly hourlong training sessions will be a
slide presentation detailing what the policy does and does not
allow. The services also plan to use video presentations, role
playing exercises and pamphlets to hammer home that slurs and
innuendos are forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to insure everyone in every command has this
training,'' said Cmdr. Greg Smith, a Navy spokesman. ``This hasn't
quite risen to the level of annual sexual harassment training, but
it's clearly important.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army said it hoped to give the courses to all of its members
within 90 days. ``Every four-star general on down,'' said Edwin
Viega, an Army spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force plans to complete its training within six months,
according to a spokesman, and the Navy will be done in a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said it had no immediate estimate of the cost of
the additional training. P.J. Crowley, a Defense Department
spokesman, said the expense of the training would be measured in
hours rather than in dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will cost more in effort than in money,'' said Crowley.
``How long it takes to get to the entire force will be a function
of time and opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the Army has begun training. Its presentation knocks down
the widely held assumption that a service member can be
investigated as gay if he or she goes to a homosexual bar, reads
homosexual magazines or has gay friends.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 14 slides shown during the training reads: ``Zero
tolerance for harassment.'' In bold letters on another slide, the
Army tells its members that ``derogatory, persistent, threatening
or annoying behavior'' is unaccepted in any form, on or off duty.
</P>
<P>
   According to a draft of the Navy's presentation, instructors
will be asked to use a standard exercise in sensitivity training
that develops trust and respect for all sailors in the service.
Then the instruction will show slides defining anti-gay harassment
and reminding sailors that their commanding officers are under
orders to ``take immediate steps to protect the safety of the
victim, stop the threatening behavior, and hold those responsible
for the harassment accountable.''

 &HT;    NFL's year of living feloniously
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the National Football League's violent crime policy went
into effect in 1997, league officials liked to say that it was
discouraging violence among players.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before the NFL's recent year of living feloniously,
lowlighted by the first two active players in league history being
charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Ravens All-Pro linebacker Ray Lewis' arrest Monday on
murder charges after the stabbing deaths of two men in Buckhead was
the latest in a series of events that have given the league's image
a black eye.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina wide receiver Rae Carruth is facing trial over the
drive-by shooting death of his girlfriend, Cherica Adams, who was
pregnant with their child. When a warrant was issued for Carruth's
arrest, he became a fugitive and was found hiding in the trunk of a
car.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples from police blotters this past season:
</P>
<P>
   _Dolphins running back Cecil Collins was arrested for breaking
into a neighbor's apartment. The married woman living there told
police Collins had been stalking her.
</P>
<P>
   _Bills defensive tackle Marcus Spriggs and wide receiver Jeremy
McDaniel were charged in the sexual assault of two off-duty police
officers in a nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   _Broncos safety Darrius Johnson was charged with punching a
topless dancer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Colts defensive back Steve Muhammad was charged with battery
in the beating of his pregnant wife. He was cleared in her death,
which was attributed to injuries suffered in an auto accident.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jets offensive tackle Jumbo Elliott was charged with assault
after being accused of punching a man and a woman in a bar. Matt
O'Dwyer, a Jets teammate then and now with the Bengals, was
arrested in the same incident and is being sued by three police
officers who claim he kicked out a window in their car, sending
shattered glass into their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   _And Ray Lewis was charged with punching a woman in a bar.
</P>
<P>
   The league's violent crime policy calls for offending players to
undergo clinical evaluations and counseling. It can include fines
or suspensions. The policy can be applied whether or not a charged
player is found guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The first player punished was New Orleans wide receiver Keith
Poole. He was required to undergo counseling and pay a $4,500 fine
after attacking a man with a golf club.
</P>
<P>
   According to the league, player arrests have gone from 38 in
1997 to 35 in '98 to 26 last year. Convictions have gone from 23 to
14 to five (through September).
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, (crime) is partly a product of society, but that is
not where we let it rest,'' NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said
here last Friday. ``We don't tolerate and we don't condone
misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Because pro athletes are in the public eye, publicity over
arrests might seem like they get in legal trouble more than society
as a whole. Whether they are is a matter of debate
</P>
<P>
   According to the book ``Pros and Cons: The criminals who play in
the NFL'', 21 percent of active players from 1996-97 had been
arrested or convicted of serious crimes. The NFL disputes these
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   A study by APBnews.com released last week indicated that 13 of
the 116 players on the two rosters for Sunday's Super Bowl XXXIV
had been arrested as adults on a variety of 120 crimes. Those
charges ranged from failure by Titans wide receiver Yancey Thigpen
to pay a fine for speeding to the involuntary manslaughter case
against Rams linebacker Leonard Little, who was drunk when his
vehicle ran into another, killing a woman. The NFL suspended Little
for a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the study also pointed out that the arrest rate was 11
percent, below the national average for men in the age groups
represented by players in Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to recognize that some of the misconduct by NFL
players has occurred before they were NFL players _ back when they
were teenagers, and in high school,'' Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   For many, that's the period in their lives when they begin to
receive special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our society's worship of elite athletes, because we
coddle and fawn over them, in some ways (means) we've created
antisocial beings who believe their needs come first,'' Merrill J.
Melnick, a sports sociologist at the State University of New York
at Brockport, told the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Critics theorize about how the violent nature of the game lends
itself to players being more violent away from it. Others say that
the NFL doesn't create potential lawbreakers; it just happens to
employ some.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are criminals in the NFL. We don't want them, but
they're members of the general population first before they're in
the NFL,'' Falcons running back Jamal Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a day trader . . . blows away 10 people in Buckhead, they
don't say he's a day trader; they say he's crazy. But when he's a
football player, that's what they talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that the league policy should provide for a lifetime
ban of players such as Little who are convicted of serious crimes.
But that is easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just kick guys out of the league immediately, you're
going against a number of right-to-work laws, and some state and
federal laws,'' said Lem Burnham, NFL vice president for player
development .
</P>
<P>
   Negative publicity for the league has not been limited to
violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   One year and one day before Lewis' arrest, Falcons free safety
Eugene Robinson was arrested on the eve of his team's appearance in
Super Bowl XXXIII and charged with attempting to solicit oral sex
from an undercover police officer.
</P>
<P>
   His Super Bowl teammate, wide receiver Tony Martin, was
acquitted of federal money laundering charges last year. Martin
spent the season with the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the NFL, behavioral problems are not limited to players.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cowboys coach Barry Switzer was caught in 1997 carrying a
gun in an airport. Former 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo was suspended
after his indictment on gambling fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, the focus is on guys on the field, not the
sidelines or the owners' box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the (1,643 players) in the NFL, to think they're all
straight-A people is ludicrous,'' said the Falcons' Anderson. ``A
guy is a person first and a player second.''

 &HT;    Two suspects sought in stabbing deaths
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Atlanta police hid Ray Lewis's driver in an unnamed
hotel room with a round-the-clock guard Tuesday while they hunted
for two more of the pro football star's entourage for the stabbing
of two young Decatur men in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 24, remains in city jail without bond, charged with
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta detectives said they are gathering information for
murder warrants for at least two more men who were in with Lewis in
his Lincoln Navigator stretch limousine early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives would not name the suspects. One officer said the
suspects were not believed to be active players, but the
possibility remained that they were former NFL players.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after the killings, officers in Buckhead and homicide
investigators found the limousine parked behind a Holiday Inn. A
uniformed officer at the scene said the chauffeur was changing a
tire that had been flattened by a bullet _ the first indication
that shots had been fired at the limo. Earlier reports had
indicated only that shots had been fired from the Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the limousine driver_ who detectives said was
cooperating fully with police _ was being kept at a local hotel for
his protection, homicide investigators said. An officer was staying
with him.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Baltimore Sun, Tony Toscov, the owner of the
limousine company that rented the Lincoln to Lewis in Baltimore,
was driving back to Maryland late Tuesday evening after the GBI
released the vehicle to him.
</P>
<P>
   Toscov told the Sun that Duanne Fassett, the limousine driver,
told him Lewis did not stab the victims. The paper said Toscov
reported that Fassett was flying back to his Maryland hometown
accompanied by a police officer
</P>
<P>
   Toscov said Lewis was picked up in a Baltimore suburb for the
ride to Atlanta and the rest of the unnamed entourage joined him in
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning Lewis, All-Pro middle linebacker for the
Baltimore Ravens, appeared in municipal court for an initial
hearing in the killings of Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar. City
Judge Elain Carlisle continued the case until Feb. 24 when senior
assistant city solicitor Larry Gardner told her there were no
witnesses ipresent.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis seemed frightened by the onslaught of cameras and
reporters. He blinked several times as he shuffled into the
courtroom, then stared at the floor and said nothing. Attorney Max
Richardson, hired by Lewis' linebacker, announced that Lewis was
``in the wrong place at the wrong time, and had nothing to do with
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was arrested Monday afternoon after he telephoned Atlanta
police upon learning a warrant had been issued for his arrest,
detectives said Tuesday. He was staying at the home of a friend
just outside the city. Detectives armed with a search warrant went
through the house, but refused to say what they were looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Friedly, spokesman for the Fulton County District Attorney,
said Lewis' case was not raised at Tuesday's regular grand jury
session, nor had any request been made for a bond hearing.
</P>
<P>
   While police continued to say that an argument that started
inside Cobalt, a popular nightclub, was the genesis of the
killings, nobody has so far reported seeing either victim inside.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Baker, an aspiring art student, nor Lollar, a young
barber, appeared affluent enough to stand the $100-per-person cover
charge and $10 drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Both Baker and Lollar loved the atmosphere that permeated
Buckhead's nightclub scene, Stroud said. They were young men and
good-looking, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar, in particular, was excited about the Super Bowl, his
friends and colleagues remember.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Payne, said he has been filming a dance show, ``The Chuck
Payne Show,'' at the Cobalt since November, said he and his crew
were filming at the Club Monay morning and saw no incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the tape, there is nothing to indicate any altercations,''
said Payne. ``Security is very tight and this place is pretty safe.
The reason we shoot our show here and not someplace else is because
it is very upscale and safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne said although he met Lewis that night, he doesn't recall
filming him. His producer had scheduled an interview with Lewis,
but it never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cook, owner of the Cobalt, said police have a copy of the
tape
</P>
<P>
   Cook said the club had 5 or 6 off-duty, uniformed Atlanta police
officers on the curb, patting down every customer, including
celebrities and their bodyguards, for weapons before they came
inside. Twenty private security guards were working inside the
club. None reported any kind of fight or disturbance, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly was not an altercation that happened here and
spilled out into the streets,'' Cook said. ``We didn't know of any
altercation at all. As far as we concerned there wasn't a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   There were six or seven people in Lewis's entourage, employees
said. They stayed along with about 400 others until the club closed
at 3 a.m. Cook said barricades had to be removed from in front of
the club so the huge Navigator could pull up to the curb. Lewis'
entourage came out without him, and one of them had to go back
inside the club to get the linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   A bellhop at the Georgian Terrace said he carried bags for the
NFL star and a cousin whose name he did not know to Baltimore
player's room in the historic midtown Atlanta hotel Thursday. He
refused to give his name, but said Lewis was ``a nice guy'' and a
generous tipper.
</P>
<P>
   He said he also talked with Lewis' driver, who he said told him
his rate was $150 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis joins Carolina Panthers receiver Rae Carruth as the only
active NFL players to be charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty against Carruth,
indicted Jan. 4 for first-degree murder after his pregnant
girlfriend, Cherica Adams, died the from wounds suffered in a
drive-by shooting.

 &HT;    NFL star denied bond in Atlanta double murder
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All-Pro linebacker Ray Lewis of the Baltimore Ravens
was denied bond today on a double murder charge in connection with
the slayings of two men in a popular Atlanta entertainment
district.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with two counts of murder late Monday evening in
connection with the stabbing deaths, Lewis was handcuffed and
shackled as he slowly shuffled into a municipal courtroom to face
Judge Elaine Carlisle.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis seemed frightened and overwhelmed by the onslaught of TV
cameras and reporters aiming their attention at him. He blinked
several times, then stared at his feet.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, Max Richardson, said Lewis, 24, is innocent of the
charges and that the Atlanta Police Department is aware of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but he had
nothing to do with this,'' Richardson, an Atlanta attorney hired by
Lewis' agents, said. ``There are two other suspects and police know
that. My client was at the scene where these crimes took place, but
he had nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson would not elaborate on what he meant regarding two
other suspects, but said investigators are looking for other people
who were riding in a black Lincoln Navigator stretch limousine seen
roaring away from the intersection where the bodies of Jacinth
Baker and Richard Lollar lay early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, friends from Akron, Ohio, who had moved to an
Atlanta suburb, were stabbed repeatedly, said the Fulton County
Medical Examiner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Lewis was a passenger in the limousine, but have not
revealed who else was riding with the football star. Homicide
investigators spent most of Monday talking to the driver of the
limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Police would not comment this morning after Lewis' hearing was
reset to Feb. 24. Senior Assistant Solicitor Larry Gardner said
there were no witnesses in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll come back ... and the truth will come out,'' Richardson
said as he walked briskly from the courthouse. ``Ray is asking all
his friends and fans to pray for him.''

 &HT;    Stabbing victims came to Atlanta for better life
 &HT;    By R. Robin McDonald
 &HT;    and Janet Frankston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1996, an Ohio friend of Richard Lollar and Jacinth ``Shorty''
Baker was gunned down during Freaknik at Capitol Homes, a half-mile
from the Georgia Capitol. But the slaying of Akron resident Donnie
Cantrell, 24, didn't stop Lollar and Baker from leaving Akron for
Atlanta a year later seeking better jobs, a better education and a
better life, said friends who knew the two men.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Lollar's friends told him, ``Oh, you can really live in
Atlanta,'' remembered Lollar's grandmother, Joyce Lollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had friends down there who told him how much better he
could do there,'' his grandmother said. `` A lot of times, young
people want to venture out.''
</P>
<P>
   But before dawn Monday, Baker and Lollar _ like their Akron
friend _ were also slain on an Atlanta city street. The two men
were stabbed to death in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rich was a good person,'' said master barber John ``Silk''
Wilkerson, who co-owns a Decatur, Ga., barber shop and hired Lollar
as a barber when he first arrived in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was humble. He wasn't a trouble-maker. He will be missed by
a lot of people here.''
</P>
<P>
   People who work at the barber shop and O.V.'s Hair Salon in a
small worn shopping center are more than neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is friends around here,'' said Nikki Darden, one of
the hair stylists for whom Lollar was a familiar face.
</P>
<P>
   When business is slow, Lollar would drift over to O.V.'s to
chat, Darden said. Baker, who moved to DeKalb County when Lollar
did, was a weekly regular at the barber shop, said Decatur resident
Paul Stroud, with whom Baker often stayed.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar often worked 12-hour days, said his colleagues and
friends. He was engaged to be married. His fiance, Kellye Smith, is
expecting the couple's first child. He talked about going to
college to study engineering. But he also dreamed of opening his
own shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to club a lot,'' said Anthony Jones, a shop customer
who often had drinks at the Club Mirage with Lollar after work.
``He was a lovable person. Nobody hated him.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Lollar anticipated the birth of his first child,
Wilkerson said, he didn't go out as much. ``He was pretty much
concentrating on his profession here, cutting hair, and being the
best father he could be for his expected child.''
</P>
<P>
   The beauticians who brought their small sons to the barber shop
said Lollar was good with children and kept lollipops to occupy
them while he cut their hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't the type to have a conflict with anybody,'' Darden
said.
</P>
<P>
   Life in Atlanta was so good that Lollar told a friend he never
wanted to return to Akron.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to get away from the small city life,'' said Tommy
House, owner of House Effects in West Akron where Lollar cut hair
for three years.
</P>
<P>
   House Effects is a three-chair neighborhood shop where people
come in to get their hair cut and share stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Atlanta, there's always something to do,'' House said.
``Here, you're stuck with nothing to do a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I talked to him, he said he was enjoying it. He
said he'd never move back home.''
</P>
<P>
   House first met Lollar when he was 13. ``He was a master barber
from the start,'' he said. ``There wasn't much I could teach him.
He already knew everything. ``
</P>
<P>
   Before he left Ohio, said Lollard's cousin, Charita Hill, Lollar
was named Akron's Barber of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar and Baker had been friends since they were children in
west Akron. Both attended Buchtel High School, but neither
graduated, said school principal Rob McKinnie.
</P>
<P>
   When Lollar came to Atlanta, Baker, three years younger,
followed.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Wilson, Baker's uncle, said his nephew moved to Atlanta
hoping the move would eventually lead to admission in a California
art school.
</P>
<P>
   Baker like to draw cartoons and fashion designs and dreamed of a
future as a sketch artist, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a real nice person. Real caring and funny,'' he said.
``He loved to joke all the time. .. He would give away the clothes
off his body if he had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parents were ill when Baker left Akron. On Feb. 3 last
year, his mother, Susan Ann Wilson, died of a brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Ralph Baker Jr., had died just two months earlier of
a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   In Decatur, Baker _ who was five feet one and nicknamed
``Shorty'' _ was befriended by Stroud and his wife, Shirley. Baker
used the older couple's address when he acquired a Georgia
identification card and occasionally stayed at the couple's Decatur
apartment, Stroud said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like a little son to us,'' he said. ``My wife was real
attached to him....He was just so short and cute.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker, Stroud said, was killed on his wife's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Baker didn't have a job, but was taking classes to complete his
G.E.D., Stroud said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good sketch artist,'' Stroud said. ``He had that
talent where he could look at you and sketch you right off.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Baker and Lollar loved the atmosphere that permeated
Buckhead's nightclub scene, Stroud said. They were young men and
good-looking, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar, in particular, was excited about the Super Bowl, his
friends and colleagues remember.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted Tennessee to win. And on Saturday, he told Darden that
he wanted to watch the Super Bowl and celebrate. And that he was
looking for a Super Bowl party.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't say he was going to the Cobalt Lounge,'' Darden
said. ``He was just going to a Super Bowl party.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and acquaintances of the two victims insist that
neither Baker nor Lollar were violent, although Lollar, according
to his aunt, Thomasina Threatt, once spent several months in an
Ohio juvenile correctional facility for ``fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard didn't have a temper at all,'' she said. ``I guess he
was at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong person.''
</P>
<P>
   Stroud said he can't fathom how Baker ever became involved in a
brawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's Shorty going to do with six or seven guys?'' he said.
``I always told them, 'You got to be careful in those streets,
man.' ``

 &HT;    NFL's year of living feloniously
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the National Football League's violent crime policy went
into effect in 1997, league officials liked to say that it was
discouraging violence among players.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before the NFL's recent year of living feloniously,
lowlighted by the first two active players in league history being
charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Ravens All-Pro linebacker Ray Lewis' arrest Monday on
murder charges after the stabbing deaths of two men in Buckhead was
the latest in a series of events that have given the league's image
a black eye.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina wide receiver Rae Carruth is facing trial over the
drive-by shooting death of his girlfriend, Cherica Adams, who was
pregnant with their child. When a warrant was issued for Carruth's
arrest, he became a fugitive and was found hiding in the trunk of a
car.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples from police blotters this past season:
</P>
<P>
   _Dolphins running back Cecil Collins was arrested for breaking
into a neighbor's apartment. The married woman living there told
police Collins had been stalking her.
</P>
<P>
   _Bills defensive tackle Marcus Spriggs and wide receiver Jeremy
McDaniel were charged in the sexual assault of two off-duty police
officers in a nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   _Broncos safety Darrius Johnson was charged with punching a
topless dancer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Colts defensive back Steve Muhammad was charged with battery
in the beating of his pregnant wife. He was cleared in her death,
which was attributed to injuries suffered in an auto accident.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jets offensive tackle Jumbo Elliott was charged with assault
after being accused of punching a man and a woman in a bar. Matt
O'Dwyer, a Jets teammate then and now with the Bengals, was
arrested in the same incident and is being sued by three police
officers who claim he kicked out a window in their car, sending
shattered glass into their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   _And Ray Lewis was charged with punching a woman in a bar.
</P>
<P>
   The league's violent crime policy calls for offending players to
undergo clinical evaluations and counseling. It can include fines
or suspensions. The policy can be applied whether or not a charged
player is found guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The first player punished was New Orleans wide receiver Keith
Poole. He was required to undergo counseling and pay a $4,500 fine
after attacking a man with a golf club.
</P>
<P>
   According to the league, player arrests have gone from 38 in
1997 to 35 in '98 to 26 last year. Convictions have gone from 23 to
14 to five (through September).
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, (crime) is partly a product of society, but that is
not where we let it rest,'' NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said
here last Friday. ``We don't tolerate and we don't condone
misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Because pro athletes are in the public eye, publicity over
arrests might seem like they get in legal trouble more than society
as a whole. Whether they are is a matter of debate
</P>
<P>
   According to the book ``Pros and Cons: The criminals who play in
the NFL'', 21 percent of active players from 1996-97 had been
arrested or convicted of serious crimes. The NFL disputes these
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   A study by APBnews.com released last week indicated that 13 of
the 116 players on the two rosters for Sunday's Super Bowl XXXIV
had been arrested as adults on a variety of 120 crimes. Those
charges ranged from failure by Titans wide receiver Yancey Thigpen
to pay a fine for speeding to the involuntary manslaughter case
against Rams linebacker Leonard Little, who was drunk when his
vehicle ran into another, killing a woman. The NFL suspended Little
for a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the study also pointed out that the arrest rate was 11
percent, below the national average for men in the age groups
represented by players in Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to recognize that some of the misconduct by NFL
players has occurred before they were NFL players _ back when they
were teenagers, and in high school,'' Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   For many, that's the period in their lives when they begin to
receive special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our society's worship of elite athletes, because we
coddle and fawn over them, in some ways (means) we've created
antisocial beings who believe their needs come first,'' Merrill J.
Melnick, a sports sociologist at the State University of New York
at Brockport, told the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Critics theorize about how the violent nature of the game lends
itself to players being more violent away from it. Others say that
the NFL doesn't create potential lawbreakers; it just happens to
employ some.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are criminals in the NFL. We don't want them, but
they're members of the general population first before they're in
the NFL,'' Falcons running back Jamal Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a day trader . . . blows away 10 people in Buckhead, they
don't say he's a day trader; they say he's crazy. But when he's a
football player, that's what they talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that the league policy should provide for a lifetime
ban of players such as Little who are convicted of serious crimes.
But that is easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just kick guys out of the league immediately, you're
going against a number of right-to-work laws, and some state and
federal laws,'' said Lem Burnham, NFL vice president for player
development .
</P>
<P>
   Negative publicity for the league has not been limited to
violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   One year and one day before Lewis' arrest, Falcons free safety
Eugene Robinson was arrested on the eve of his team's appearance in
Super Bowl XXXIII and charged with attempting to solicit oral sex
from an undercover police officer.
</P>
<P>
   His Super Bowl teammate, wide receiver Tony Martin, was
acquitted of federal money laundering charges last year. Martin
spent the season with the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the NFL, behavioral problems are not limited to players.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cowboys coach Barry Switzer was caught in 1997 carrying a
gun in an airport. Former 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo was suspended
after his indictment on gambling fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, the focus is on guys on the field, not the
sidelines or the owners' box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the (1,643 players) in the NFL, to think they're all
straight-A people is ludicrous,'' said the Falcons' Anderson. ``A
guy is a person first and a player second.''

 &HT;    Two suspects sought in stabbing deaths
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Atlanta police hid Ray Lewis's driver in an unnamed
hotel room with a round-the-clock guard Tuesday while they hunted
for two more of the pro football star's entourage for the stabbing
of two young Decatur men in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 24, remains in city jail without bond, charged with
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta detectives said they are gathering information for
murder warrants for at least two more men who were in with Lewis in
his Lincoln Navigator stretch limousine early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives would not name the suspects. One officer said the
suspects were not believed to be active players, but the
possibility remained that they were former NFL players.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after the killings, officers in Buckhead and homicide
investigators found the limousine parked behind a Holiday Inn. A
uniformed officer at the scene said the chauffeur was changing a
tire that had been flattened by a bullet _ the first indication
that shots had been fired at the limo. Earlier reports had
indicated only that shots had been fired from the Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the limousine driver_ who detectives said was
cooperating fully with police _ was being kept at a local hotel for
his protection, homicide investigators said. An officer was staying
with him.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Baltimore Sun, Tony Toscov, the owner of the
limousine company that rented the Lincoln to Lewis in Baltimore,
was driving back to Maryland late Tuesday evening after the GBI
released the vehicle to him.
</P>
<P>
   Toscov told the Sun that Duanne Fassett, the limousine driver,
told him Lewis did not stab the victims. The paper said Toscov
reported that Fassett was flying back to his Maryland hometown
accompanied by a police officer
</P>
<P>
   Toscov said Lewis was picked up in a Baltimore suburb for the
ride to Atlanta and the rest of the unnamed entourage joined him in
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning Lewis, All-Pro middle linebacker for the
Baltimore Ravens, appeared in municipal court for an initial
hearing in the killings of Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar. City
Judge Elain Carlisle continued the case until Feb. 24 when senior
assistant city solicitor Larry Gardner told her there were no
witnesses ipresent.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis seemed frightened by the onslaught of cameras and
reporters. He blinked several times as he shuffled into the
courtroom, then stared at the floor and said nothing. Attorney Max
Richardson, hired by Lewis' linebacker, announced that Lewis was
``in the wrong place at the wrong time, and had nothing to do with
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was arrested Monday afternoon after he telephoned Atlanta
police upon learning a warrant had been issued for his arrest,
detectives said Tuesday. He was staying at the home of a friend
just outside the city. Detectives armed with a search warrant went
through the house, but refused to say what they were looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Friedly, spokesman for the Fulton County District Attorney,
said Lewis' case was not raised at Tuesday's regular grand jury
session, nor had any request been made for a bond hearing.
</P>
<P>
   While police continued to say that an argument that started
inside Cobalt, a popular nightclub, was the genesis of the
killings, nobody has so far reported seeing either victim inside.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Baker, an aspiring art student, nor Lollar, a young
barber, appeared affluent enough to stand the $100-per-person cover
charge and $10 drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Both Baker and Lollar loved the atmosphere that permeated
Buckhead's nightclub scene, Stroud said. They were young men and
good-looking, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar, in particular, was excited about the Super Bowl, his
friends and colleagues remember.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Payne, said he has been filming a dance show, ``The Chuck
Payne Show,'' at the Cobalt since November, said he and his crew
were filming at the Club Monay morning and saw no incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the tape, there is nothing to indicate any altercations,''
said Payne. ``Security is very tight and this place is pretty safe.
The reason we shoot our show here and not someplace else is because
it is very upscale and safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne said although he met Lewis that night, he doesn't recall
filming him. His producer had scheduled an interview with Lewis,
but it never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cook, owner of the Cobalt, said police have a copy of the
tape
</P>
<P>
   Cook said the club had 5 or 6 off-duty, uniformed Atlanta police
officers on the curb, patting down every customer, including
celebrities and their bodyguards, for weapons before they came
inside. Twenty private security guards were working inside the
club. None reported any kind of fight or disturbance, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly was not an altercation that happened here and
spilled out into the streets,'' Cook said. ``We didn't know of any
altercation at all. As far as we concerned there wasn't a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   There were six or seven people in Lewis's entourage, employees
said. They stayed along with about 400 others until the club closed
at 3 a.m. Cook said barricades had to be removed from in front of
the club so the huge Navigator could pull up to the curb. Lewis'
entourage came out without him, and one of them had to go back
inside the club to get the linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   A bellhop at the Georgian Terrace said he carried bags for the
NFL star and a cousin whose name he did not know to Baltimore
player's room in the historic midtown Atlanta hotel Thursday. He
refused to give his name, but said Lewis was ``a nice guy'' and a
generous tipper.
</P>
<P>
   He said he also talked with Lewis' driver, who he said told him
his rate was $150 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis joins Carolina Panthers receiver Rae Carruth as the only
active NFL players to be charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty against Carruth,
indicted Jan. 4 for first-degree murder after his pregnant
girlfriend, Cherica Adams, died the from wounds suffered in a
drive-by shooting.

 &HT;    Stabbing victims came to Atlanta for better life
 &HT;    By R. Robin McDonald
 &HT;    and Janet Frankston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1996, an Ohio friend of Richard Lollar and Jacinth ``Shorty''
Baker was gunned down during Freaknik at Capitol Homes, a half-mile
from the Georgia Capitol. But the slaying of Akron resident Donnie
Cantrell, 24, didn't stop Lollar and Baker from leaving Akron for
Atlanta a year later seeking better jobs, a better education and a
better life, said friends who knew the two men.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Lollar's friends told him, ``Oh, you can really live in
Atlanta,'' remembered Lollar's grandmother, Joyce Lollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had friends down there who told him how much better he
could do there,'' his grandmother said. `` A lot of times, young
people want to venture out.''
</P>
<P>
   But before dawn Monday, Baker and Lollar _ like their Akron
friend _ were also slain on an Atlanta city street. The two men
were stabbed to death in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rich was a good person,'' said master barber John ``Silk''
Wilkerson, who co-owns a Decatur, Ga., barber shop and hired Lollar
as a barber when he first arrived in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was humble. He wasn't a trouble-maker. He will be missed by
a lot of people here.''
</P>
<P>
   People who work at the barber shop and O.V.'s Hair Salon in a
small worn shopping center are more than neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is friends around here,'' said Nikki Darden, one of
the hair stylists for whom Lollar was a familiar face.
</P>
<P>
   When business is slow, Lollar would drift over to O.V.'s to
chat, Darden said. Baker, who moved to DeKalb County when Lollar
did, was a weekly regular at the barber shop, said Decatur resident
Paul Stroud, with whom Baker often stayed.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar often worked 12-hour days, said his colleagues and
friends. He was engaged to be married. His fiance, Kellye Smith, is
expecting the couple's first child. He talked about going to
college to study engineering. But he also dreamed of opening his
own shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to club a lot,'' said Anthony Jones, a shop customer
who often had drinks at the Club Mirage with Lollar after work.
``He was a lovable person. Nobody hated him.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Lollar anticipated the birth of his first child,
Wilkerson said, he didn't go out as much. ``He was pretty much
concentrating on his profession here, cutting hair, and being the
best father he could be for his expected child.''
</P>
<P>
   The beauticians who brought their small sons to the barber shop
said Lollar was good with children and kept lollipops to occupy
them while he cut their hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't the type to have a conflict with anybody,'' Darden
said.
</P>
<P>
   Life in Atlanta was so good that Lollar told a friend he never
wanted to return to Akron.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to get away from the small city life,'' said Tommy
House, owner of House Effects in West Akron where Lollar cut hair
for three years.
</P>
<P>
   House Effects is a three-chair neighborhood shop where people
come in to get their hair cut and share stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Atlanta, there's always something to do,'' House said.
``Here, you're stuck with nothing to do a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I talked to him, he said he was enjoying it. He
said he'd never move back home.''
</P>
<P>
   House first met Lollar when he was 13. ``He was a master barber
from the start,'' he said. ``There wasn't much I could teach him.
He already knew everything. ``
</P>
<P>
   Before he left Ohio, said Lollard's cousin, Charita Hill, Lollar
was named Akron's Barber of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar and Baker had been friends since they were children in
west Akron. Both attended Buchtel High School, but neither
graduated, said school principal Rob McKinnie.
</P>
<P>
   When Lollar came to Atlanta, Baker, three years younger,
followed.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Wilson, Baker's uncle, said his nephew moved to Atlanta
hoping the move would eventually lead to admission in a California
art school.
</P>
<P>
   Baker like to draw cartoons and fashion designs and dreamed of a
future as a sketch artist, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a real nice person. Real caring and funny,'' he said.
``He loved to joke all the time. .. He would give away the clothes
off his body if he had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parents were ill when Baker left Akron. On Feb. 3 last
year, his mother, Susan Ann Wilson, died of a brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Ralph Baker Jr., had died just two months earlier of
a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   In Decatur, Baker _ who was five feet one and nicknamed
``Shorty'' _ was befriended by Stroud and his wife, Shirley. Baker
used the older couple's address when he acquired a Georgia
identification card and occasionally stayed at the couple's Decatur
apartment, Stroud said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like a little son to us,'' he said. ``My wife was real
attached to him....He was just so short and cute.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker, Stroud said, was killed on his wife's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Baker didn't have a job, but was taking classes to complete his
G.E.D., Stroud said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good sketch artist,'' Stroud said. ``He had that
talent where he could look at you and sketch you right off.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Baker and Lollar loved the atmosphere that permeated
Buckhead's nightclub scene, Stroud said. They were young men and
good-looking, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar, in particular, was excited about the Super Bowl, his
friends and colleagues remember.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted Tennessee to win. And on Saturday, he told Darden that
he wanted to watch the Super Bowl and celebrate. And that he was
looking for a Super Bowl party.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't say he was going to the Cobalt Lounge,'' Darden
said. ``He was just going to a Super Bowl party.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and acquaintances of the two victims insist that
neither Baker nor Lollar were violent, although Lollar, according
to his aunt, Thomasina Threatt, once spent several months in an
Ohio juvenile correctional facility for ``fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard didn't have a temper at all,'' she said. ``I guess he
was at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong person.''
</P>
<P>
   Stroud said he can't fathom how Baker ever became involved in a
brawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's Shorty going to do with six or seven guys?'' he said.
``I always told them, 'You got to be careful in those streets,
man.' ``

COALITION DEAL BY AUSTRIANS DEFIES EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also AUSTRIA-REACT, AUSTRIA-U.S.) 
(mk) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL JR.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Defying threats of diplomatic isolation by the
European Union and now the United States, the Freedom Party of
Joerg Haider and the People's Party announced Tuesday night that
they would form a government.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Austrian constitution, the makeup of any proposed
Cabinet must be presented to President Thomas Klestil, and the
parties said they would do that Wednesday. Klestil could still bend
to international pressure by asking for a new arrangement excluding
the anti-immigrant Freedom Party, but that was considered unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The People's Party failed in three months of trying to rebuild
its 13-year-old alliance with the pro-labor Social Democrats, who
came in first in the October vote. And it is widely acknowledged
that if the option of calling new elections were used, Haider would
probably win and become chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the European Union said that all its member states
would downgrade their diplomatic relations with Austria if Haider's
party, which they regard as xenophobic and extremist, was allowed
into government.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the United States joined the chorus, if a bit
obliquely, by saying that a government with Haider's party in it
``would affect our bilateral relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   What exactly will happen if Klestil says yes to a
``black-and-blue'' government _ the parties' colors are common
political shorthand here _ is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   At a long, late evening press conference, Haider seemed surer
than his coalition partner, Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schussel,
that the deal would hold. He called foreign attempts to stop the
government ``totally inappropriate'' but said, ``We will convince
those who expressed concern that their worries were in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by reporters, he said, ``The Freedom Party has no
sympathy for totalitarian regimes or Naziism.''
</P>
<P>
   Schussel, whose party lost to Haider's by only 415 votes,
reminded other Europeans that ``we are not a semi-authoritarian
developing country.'' But, he conceded, ``We are really under the
microscope. It's a test phase for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The parties' roles in the new government were not described. The
recent assumption has been that Schussel would become chancellor
and Haider would stay governor of Carinthia province and appoint
allies to the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians and analysts were pleased Tuesday that other
countries had threatened Austria, saying it was a statement for
democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Others were disturbed at the prospect of big countries joining
together to try to dictate the results of a free and open election
that gave Haider 27 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few days, Austrians have expressed frustration that
other nations would dare to dictate whom they could elect.
Austrians also feel that the foreign media whip up the specter of
Naziism in their coverage of Haider, whose appeal, they say, is
more complex than the simple accusations that he is a xenophobe or
an apologist for the Third Reich. Austria, in its 700-year history
as a nation and empire, spent seven years in the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thundering against the fascist danger is easier than informing
themselves,'' said Die Presse, a Vienna daily.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian national television showed a portion of a CBS News
broadcast Tuesday night that contained an old clip of Hitler. And a
CNN broadcast produced in London showed a clip of a lovely steeple
as a grave voice described ``the shadow of Naziism behind the
pleasant scenery and ordered life'' and characterized Austria's
complex imperial past as ``seeing itself as Europe's fortress
against undesirables.''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, as foreign reporters were chasing Haider across
the ski slopes while he celebrated his 50th birthday, about 600
neo-Nazis were marching under Berlin's Brandenburg Gate to protest
Germany's plans for a Holocaust monument. The English-language
International Herald Tribune, which is sold here, ran only three
paragraphs about it.
</P>
<P>
   Neo-Nazis never demonstrate here, as they do in the United
States and Scandinavian countries, nor are the homes of Turks
firebombed, as they are in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Vienna's tabloids run headlines screaming ``Austria is Not a
Nazi Country!''
</P>
<P>
   The European countries condemning them, Austrians point out,
have had full diplomatic relations with Stalinist, Maoist and
religious-fundamentalist dictatorships, Pol Pot's Cambodia and
Augusto Pinochet's Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Outside analysts are as divided as politicians are: ``The EU's
announcement didn't come as a surprise to me, but the strength of
it did,'' said John Palmer of the European Policy Center, a
Brussels, Belgium-based think tank. ``It shows that issues like
pluralism and anti-racism are now part of the European Union
fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alex Ashbourne, an analyst at the Center for European
Reform, a London counterpart, called the pressure ``absolutely
outrageous, and quite alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Haider was democratically elected by quite a number of
people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what roads this takes you down? What if the
Conservative Party here, which has a policy of withdrawing from the
EU, was elected again? Do they isolate Britain?''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the European Union had unexpectedly announced that
there would be ``no more business as usual in the bilateral
relations'' with any government integrating Haider's party.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian candidates for posts in international organizations
would find no support, it said, and Austrian ambassadors would be
received ``only at the technical level.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said there was no apparent legal or procedural problem
with the statement, even though the debate over it was closed and
there was no vote in the European Parliament. Essentially, he said,
all 14 countries were independently adjusting their foreign
policies toward Austria, but announcing it together.
</P>
<P>
   The rules for censuring a member of the European Union were
passed in a treaty negotiated in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, two
years ago, but the thinking then was to have them ready in case
eastern European countries were admitted and then had military
coups or began persecuting their citizens, said Charles Grant of
the Center for European Reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can't possibly apply those sanctions to Austria,'' he
said. ``It's a squeaky clean democracy, with free elections, a free
press and so on.''

   SEATAC, Wash. _ Every major airline compiles meticulous plans
for responding when the awful news comes that one of its planes has
gone down. And within moments of hearing that Flight 261 had
plunged into the Pacific Ocean northwest of Los Angeles,
Seattle-based Alaska Airlines called in grief counselors and put
its ``critical incident response team'' to work, ready to console
the relatives and friends of the missing passengers.
</P>
<P>
   But to an unusual degree, the Alaska Airlines team also wound up
ministering to itself Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At least 35 of the 88 people believed dead in the crash Monday
were connected in some fashion to the airline or its commuter
affiliate, Horizon Air, also based in Seatac. Many were traveling
on free or sharply reduced standby tickets, a standard perk that
lures many young people to the airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   So when Flight 261 was called for boarding Monday afternoon in
the resort town of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, it turned out there was
plenty of room during this post-holiday, weekday travel lull for
Sarah Pearson, a 32-year-old Seattle-based flight attendant for
Alaska who had been on vacation with her husband, Rodney, her
6-year-old daughter, Rachel, and an infant child. And James J.
Ryan, a Portland flight attendant, was able to get on board with
his parents and a brother. Anjesh Prasad, a 19-year-old ground
service agent with Horizon, got on with his cousins, Avini Prasad
and Avines Deo.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Janosik, 20, a food and beverage agent for Horizon, had
been on a five-day vacation with Stacy Schuyler, also 20, a ground
service agent, and two friends. They got on, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loved it, she just loved it,'' Miss Janosik's housemate,
Wes Miller, recalled Tuesday. ``She worked a lot, she picked up
extra shifts all time, but whenever she had some days off, she just
wanted to travel. She said, `This is amazing. I can go all over the
place.'''
</P>
<P>
   These people were all among the employees being mourned Tuesday
at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, where Alaska and Horizon
control nearly 50 percent of the passenger load and together amount
to one of the region's largest employers.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they worked to maintain their normal 500-flight daily
schedule, the sense of shock and grief that descends upon the staff
of any airline involved in a fatal crash was palpably compounded by
the fact that almost every employee seems to have known one or more
of the missing passengers on the flight, the company's first
involving a fatality in nearly 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are very affected by it personally,'' said
Jack Evans, a company spokesman. ``We all are. The thing is, we're
now the 10th-largest airline in the country, but for years, we were
simply a very small carrier that considered itself one big extended
family. I know that sounds corny, but it's the truth. The reality
is, people know each other here.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska was struggling to console many other people whose loved
ones had no connection to the airline whatsoever and the tragedy
rippled throughout Seattle, where most of the passengers were
bound.
</P>
<P>
   At John Hay Elementary in Seattle's Queen Anne neighborhood, a
flag was lowered to half-staff in memory of four students _ three
first-graders and one second-grader _ who were on the flight,
according to the passenger manifest. One was Rachel Pearson, the
6-year-old daughter of the flight attendant, and three other Hay
students _ Blake, Miles and Coriande Clemetson _ apparently died
along with their 6-month-old brother, Spencer, and their parents,
David and Carolyn.
</P>
<P>
   Also among those thought to have perished on Flight 261 were
Morris Thompson, an Athabascan Indian who headed one of Alaska's
native-run corporations and was commissioner of the U.S. Bureau of
Indian Affairs in the late 1960s and early 1970s, along with his
wife, Thelma, and their eldest daughter, Cheryl; Cynthia Oti, an
investments expert who hosted a KSFO radio show in San Francisco
called ``Financial Fitness: Your Weekend Workout''; and Tom
Stockley, wine columnist for the Seattle Times, and his wife,
Peggy.
</P>
<P>
   Also missing were Linda and Joe Knight, the popular
wife-and-husband co-pastors of Rock Church Northwest in Monroe,
Wash., a non-denominational congregation. They had frequently
traveled to Mexico on missionary work, and parishioners said
Tuesday they were returning from a school-building project there
when they boarded the ill-fated flight.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's chairman and chief executive officer, John F.
Kelly, speaking at a news conference in Los Angeles, extended
condolences to the friends and family of all passengers, but he
also conceded that the tragedy had taken a deeply personal toll at
the airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are family, there are co-workers,'' said Kelly, who had
been better known as the subject of a series of whimsical radio ads
for Alaska in which his mother talks about the airline her son
runs. ``I have, as you can imagine, a number of stunned
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The home page on the airline's web site, www.alaskaair.com, was
also given over to an emotional statement from Kelly, and included
detailed information on the crash and links to a ``family center''
where people could obtain even more information about the victims.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport, there were signs of grief all around. Two Alaska
flight attendants walked toward each other in Concourse D, stopped,
and wordlessly broke into a long and tearful hug. Many employees,
accustomed to taking frequent advantage of the travel perks, spoke
of the randomness of fate.
</P>
<P>
   Another large group of employees and friends had traveled to
Seattle on Monday from Puerto Vallarta on a slightly earlier flight
that stopped in Los Angeles, instead of San Francisco, the
intermediate destination for Flight 261.

   PINEDALE, Wyo. _ Big-time sports seldom reach a place like this.
Heck, small-time sports seldom reach a place like this.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday was Pinedale's day in the sun _ and a toasty one, at
that, as temperatures reached the mid-20s when the first of 23
mushers crossed the finish line on the third leg of a 12-day,
410-mile dog sled race through western Wyoming, chasing $120,000 in
prizes and shining a bright light on small towns like Pinedale.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled at the western edge of the Wind River Mountains,
Pinedale is 100 miles from the nearest Interstate. Its municipal
airport has no commercial service; no railroad slices through town.
A motorist might stop here on the way from Denver to Jackson, a
resort town 80 miles to the northwest, but otherwise it lies
forgotten most of the year, a town of 1,181 people with no traffic
lights, movie theater or dry cleaner in the least populated state
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Most people here like it that way, especially in the summer,
when fly-fishing, hiking and the Museum of the Mountain Man draw
hundreds of vacationers, bolstering the local economy. Some
visitors have enjoyed the area so much that they bought a second
home here. James A. Baker 3rd, the former secretary of state, has
one. So do Donald M. Kendall, the former chief executive of
Pepsico; Erivan K. Haub, the majority shareholder of A&AMP;P; and Leon
Hirsch, a onetime advertising copywriter who says he invented
surgical staples. All but Hirsch are listed in the local phone
book.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, though, life in Pinedale and its cowboy ways are
changing. Word is getting out. Western towns of scenic splendor
where everybody knows everybody else, guards still walk school
children across the street and the mounted heads of wild animals
line the walls of the general store reflect a rustic past that more
Americans want to experience.
</P>
<P>
   The question for Pinedale is how to accommodate them, a
challenge that Paul Riggs noted over coffee Tuesday morning at the
Wrangler Cafe when he said, `'The population of the world is
doubling every 20 years, so people have got to go someplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Pinedale's population is exploding. But signs of growth
are everywhere. Lots at the western edge of town now have houses
selling for $200,000. A new ski resort opened this winter, and
locals say actors like Michael Keaton, Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt
have visited, looking for property.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the 2000 census, we could have 1,300 people,'' Mayor Rose
Skinner said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   That worries some people here, who fear Pinedale could emulate
Jackson, which has changed _ some might say eroded _ from Western
to faux Western, with an expanding assortment of upscale hotels,
shops and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could grow a little,'' said Robert Bing, who owns the
Cowboy Shop here on Pine Street with his wife, Carolyn, and his
90-year-old mother, Caryn. ``But I wouldn't want to see us become
another Jackson. We'd lose some of our charm.''
</P>
<P>
   Property values in and around town are soaring because of what
Cathy C. Caskey, a broker at High Mountain Real Estate, called
``the Godfather syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People have made so much money in the stock market they see a
ranch they like and make an offer the owners can't refuse,'' she
said. As a result, families are leaving the ranching business,
replaced by second-home owners who have little interest in cattle
or developers who subdivide large tracts and sell them off for huge
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Some spreads are on the market for less than a New York City
co-op, like Fremont Butte Ranch, a 152-acre property that includes
a 3,500-square-foot log home overlooking the East Fork River, a
fishing pond, a hot springs pool and several out buildings. The
asking price was recently dropped to $1.49 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want us to grow,'' said Suzy Michnevich, a fourth generation
rancher who works part time as a waitress at McGregor's Pub. ``But
what I don't want to see is people come in here and destroy the
culture that they have come here to enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, the International Rocky Mountain Stage Stop Sled
Dog Race, the biggest of its kind this side of Alaska and now in
its fifth year, helps and hurts Pinedale. Starting last Saturday in
Jackson and looping through more than a dozen smaller towns before
returning to Jackson on Feb. 9, mushers and their dogs draw
attention to each community along the way. While not well known at
large, the mushers are celebrities in the world of dog-sledding,
which is best known for the annual 1,049-mile Iditarod race from
Anchorage to Nome, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Here, it is hard not to notice the mountains, the lakes, the
cowboy spirit and how people go out of their way for one another,
like those who baked pies for the big social Tuesday night to
celebrate the mushers, their dogs and the race.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost enough to make you want to live here.

 &HT;    Rocker issue hangs in air
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As ``Camp Leo'' opened Tuesday, the Braves started
preparing to begin a new season without John Rocker. At the same
time, the players' union filed a grievance aimed at getting Rocker
back with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Mazzone's pitching camp began at Turner Field about the time
word came of the grievance filed on Rocker's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discipline is without just cause,'' the union said in a
letter to the commissioner's office, which suspended Rocker from
spring training and the first 28 days of the season and fined him
$20,000. The appeal will be heard by arbitrator Shyam Das within a
week or two.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves front office, meanwhile, hopes the furor over
Rocker's remarks in Sports Illustrated disparaging a variety of
people will die down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over,'' Braves general manager John Schuerholz said
Tuesday. ``The decision has been made. How much longer can you talk
about it?... It's a resolved issue. We've got to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of the players anticipate having to face Rocker
questions, whether now or two months from now _ or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole offseason, I tried to kind of distance myself from
it and not really think about it,'' pitcher Kevin Millwood said.
Millwood joined Mike Remlinger, Kevin McGlinchy, Derrin Ebert,
Damian Moss, Everett Stull, Jason Marquis and Scott Sobkowiak at
Camp Leo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really say you're just going to throw it away and
not ever worry about it,'' Millwood said. ``Obviously, it's put our
whole team in a situation where everybody here is going to have to
answer questions. It's not really what you want to do coming into
spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger said he thinks the Braves will be the ones paying the
price if Rocker is not allowed to come to spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you allow him to come to spring training, whether it is or
isn't a distraction, it's in a setting where it has minimal
effects,'' Remlinger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say it turns out to be the worst-case scenario you could
imagine as far as being a distraction, it's still only spring
training, and you've got however many weeks to get over that,'' he
said. ``Now if you have him come back and join us during the
season, if it's a distraction now, it can take away from winning
ball games.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox said he has resolved his own issues with
Rocker over the pitcher's remarks in SI about teammates and his
claim that Cox never talked to him about tempering his behavior
toward the fans in Shea Stadium during the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker blamed Ozzie Guillen for costing him a save, referred to
a teammate as a ``fat monkey'' _ Randall Simon has said since that
Rocker was talking about him _ and criticized the Braves clubhouse
atmosphere and the veterans who set it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told John he has to live with some of the things he did say
about the people, but when you start talking about the ball club,
that's kind of my territory,'' Cox said. ``I told John then, 'I'd
(ream) a lot of players out for a lot less than you did. If this
had happened during the season, you'd have been in a lot of
trouble.' He knows how I feel about that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Cox would obviously like to have Rocker in spring
training, he wasn't prepared to criticize Bud Selig for his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   But Remlinger did. ``It's a little extreme,'' he said. ``That's
not to say he doesn't deserve some type discipline. But that
length, I don't know if that's right. ... It's like (Selig) wanted
to wield the almighty sword they gave him a week or two ago'' when
owners renewed the ``best interest'' clause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's nothing really good that can come out of it,''
Remlinger said, ``because the union's got to fight it, whether they
think it's the right fight or not. They have to because that's what
they do _ they represent our side, things that are egregious. So
then you get negative publicity just from the fact that you're
fighting discipline for something that was a bad thing when it came
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Orza, the second in command at the players' union, is
supporting Rocker, but he runs the risk of alienating the minority
members of the players' union.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leader and former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young
pointed his finger back at the commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hypocritical because Major League Baseball is still the
organization that drove off its top two black executives
recently,'' Young said. ``They had to pick on Rocker because they
couldn't face their own problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of questions remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``When John gets back with us, it's going to be a little
tough,'' Millwood said. ``Obviously, there are people all over the
country that have seen (the article), all over the world that have
seen it. Nobody's really going to forget about it just because he's
gone for a month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be something he's going to have to deal with
more than anybody else,'' Millwood said, ``but I think with this
team, we're a pretty close-knit group. I think if any team can go
through it, this would be the team.''

TAKING MOVEMENT TO ITS OUTER LIMITS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6) 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You've probably heard that you can't put your elbow
in your ear. Well, don't tell it to H Art Chaos, an all-female
dance group from Japan. A seeming hybrid of Pilobolus and Gumby,
these 11 hyperlimber women have complete disregard for the laws of
physical possibility: they hang from their heels, pirouette at
whiplash speed, writhe convulsively on the floor, launch themselves
violently into the air and occasionally fly around the stage
carrying chairs and sometimes one another.
</P>
<P>
   This apotheosis of energy can be experienced Tuesday through
Sunday at the Joyce Theater in ``Secret Club _ Floating Angels
2000,'' a highly theatrical 80-minute work, much praised in Japan,
that has been evolving since 1993. Danced to a collage of
orchestral and electronic sound, ``Secret Club,'' according to its
creator, Sakiko Oshima, attempts to conjure up ``perverse
pleasures'' in everyday life and condense them to reveal their
unconscious meanings.
</P>
<P>
   Oshima studied ballet and modern dance before founding H Art
Chaos with her lead dancer, Naoko Shirakawa, in 1989. Their
objective has been to challenge the notion of identity in
contemporary society, and their means have been the use of female
dancers exclusively in deconstructing classics like ``Swan Lake,''
``Romeo and Juliet'' and ``The Rite of Spring,'' as well as in
multimedia works choreographed to new music.
</P>
<P>
   Critics who have seen H Art Chaos have remarked on the group's
expressive angst, jagged expressionism and perfect coordination and
timing. Shirakawa, an exceptionally athletic performer with an
over-the-moon extension, has also been singled out for her ability
to convey a wide range of emotions. Her brand of extreme dancing is
at the very heart of ``Secret Club.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Separatist rebels announced Tuesday that they were
abandoning the Chechen capital and would carry out attacks on
Russian forces from the mountains and countryside of the breakaway
republic.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military confirmed that a group of rebels had left
the besieged capital, Grozny, and headed for the town of
Alkhan-Kala on the outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting that the militants were surrounded, Russian commanders
vowed to use air power, artillery and armor to stop them from
getting away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events of 1996 when the rebels left Grozny and then came
back will not happen again,'' said Marshal Igor Sergeyev, the
Russian defense minister.
</P>
<P>
   As the fighting raged, there were reports that several rebel
commanders had been killed while trying to escape and that Shamil
Basayev, the Chechen warlord, lost his leg when the car he was
riding in struck a Russian mine. These reports could not be
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel effort to break the blockade of Grozny represents a
new and critical phase of the four-month war.
</P>
<P>
   The flight of thousands of rebels from Grozny would enable the
Russians to raise their flag over the remains of the city and claim
at least a symbolic victory. Russian officials have made no secret
of their desire to seize Grozny before the March 26 presidential
elections and help Vladimir Putin's already bright prospects to win
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the rebels' escape would also frustrate the broader Russian
strategy of subduing Chechnya. It would enable the militants to
reinforce their comrades in the Chechen highlands, carry out
partisan attacks behind Russian lines and generally prolong the
war.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus of rebels was said to have begun Monday and much of
the focus was on the town of Alkhan-Kala and the nearby village of
Yermoloskaya.
</P>
<P>
   Movladi Udugov, a rebel spokesman, maintained that the rebel
force in Grozny had successfully been been withdrawn so it could
fight elsewhere in Chechnya. But Russian officials insisted the
rebel breakout had been stymied by artillery fire and Russian
minefields.
</P>
<P>
   News reports from Alkhan-Kala described wounded rebels, some
missing limbs, lying in blood-soaked snow. Russian armor was
reported to be on the outskirts of the Alkhan-Kala, as Russian
forces tried to block the militants from advancing.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Russian and rebel officials gave conflicting accounts about the
status of the rebel breakout and casualties among the rebel
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, the Russian side has generally asserted that rebel
commanders had been killed or wounded. The militants have dismissed
such reports as a fabrication intended to undermine their morale.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the two sides reversed roles. The rebels announced that
several of their principal commanders in Grozny had perished as
they tried to flee, including the mayor of Grozny, Lecha Dudayev,
who was the nephew of the late president of the breakaway republic,
Dzhokhar Dudayev.
</P>
<P>
   Other rebel commanders said to have been killed were Aslanbek
Ismailov and Khunkar-Pasha Israpilov. The rebels also reported that
Shamil Basayev, a Chechen warlord, has been seriously wounded when
his car exploded in a Russian minefield and that one of his legs
had been blown off.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials cautioned that these reports might be a rebel
effort to deceive Moscow. The aim, Russian officials said, might be
to discourage Russian authorities from hunting for the rebel
leaders so that they could move around Chechnya more freely or even
travel abroad.
</P>
<P>
   As the militants tried to break out of Grozny, there was still
plenty of fighting within the capital. After weeks of street
clashes, Russian troops reached Minutka Square near the center of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   The square has been an important symbolic objective since the
start of the war and seizing it enabled the Russians to claim that
they are making their way to central Grozny. A number of main
avenues that lead through the city cross the square.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops also fought their way through other parts of the
city. They used inflatable rafts to cross the Sunzha river, which
bisects Grozny, and were fighting to clear snipers from nearby
apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have reported that scores of rebels fighters in
Grozny have given themselves up in recent days, but some analysts
said the militants may have simply handed over their wounded to the
Russians before trying to escape.
</P>
<P>
   A rebel decision to evacuate the city would enable the Russian
military to claim the city after two stalled offenses, weeks of
bombardment, mounting Russian military losses and casualties among
the thousands of civilians trapped in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have repeatedly boasted before that the capture of
Grozny was near.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Victor Kazanstsev, the commander of Russian troops in
the North Caucasus, predicted that the Chechen capital would be
taken in a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rebel resistance will be broken shortly,'' he said.

GM SHARES RISE ON NEWS OF SWAP FOR HUGHES SHARES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The General Motors Corp. said Tuesday it would
distribute about half the value of its Hughes Electronics stake in
a complex deal that would let GM's shareholders swap some stock
tax-free for the Hughes tracking stock.
</P>
<P>
   GM shares shot up nearly 6 percent in response to the deal;
analysts said the auto maker had met investor demands that it
unlock some of the Hughes unit's value.
</P>
<P>
   As technology and communications stocks have boomed, auto stocks
have become wallflowers, leaving GM and others stuck with almost
embarrassingly low price-to-earnings multiples. Hughes, on the
other hand, has been a high-flyer, losing money even as it wins new
customers for its DirecTV subsidiary. GM shares rose $4.6875, to
$85.25 Tuesday; the price of the Hughes tracking stock _ the GM
class ``H'' shares _ rose $2, to $114.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ecstatic that the company has finally taken some
initiative here to unlock some of the value of Hughes,'' said David
Bradley, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities. He said there was
``a mild element of disappointment'' that GM did not distribute
more of Hughes, a move that could come next year. ``This is one
step along the road and there are other steps to come.''
</P>
<P>
   GM owns all the assets of Hughes Electronics, controls the
company, and says it intends to use Hughes technology to bring GM
cars into the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   But through the tracking stock, GM has distributed to investors
an interest in the Hughes earnings streams. Wall Street expects
Hughes, like many technology stocks, to lose money this year as it
recruits customers it expects to keep in future profitable years.
By contrast, GM earned a record profit of $6 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction would cut GM's stake in Hughes from 68 percent
to 35 percent by mid-year, when it is expected to be completed. The
deal has two main components.
</P>
<P>
   First, GM would use $8 billion worth of its Hughes interest to
pay for what amounts to a massive stock buyback. In it, current
owners of GM stock could swap their shares for shares of the Hughes
tracking stock at a ratio to be determined soon. Second, GM would
contribute $7 billion worth of its Hughes stake to its pension and
benefits plans. The two moves would reduce GM's stake in Hughes to
roughly $18 billion, or 35 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will translate to a significant increase in GM's earnings
per share,'' said John F. Smith Jr., GM's chairman and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   One of the deal's big lifts to per-share earnings will come from
the reduction in $8 billion worth of GM shares outstanding. GM has
bought back $9 billion of its stock, amounting to 18 percent of the
total, since embarking on a repurchase program in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Hughes deal is meant to offer something to almost all GM
constituencies. The deal ``satisfies a lot of different
interests,'' said Harry J. Pearce, GM's vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce also said that because GM's business is cyclical and
Hughes' is not, retaining 35 percent of Hughes ``gives us a bit of
a security blanket in the event of an economic downturn.''
</P>
<P>
   GM now contributes about $700 million in pre-tax income to the
pension and benefits obligations that Tuesday's transactions will
fund in one fell swoop. GM's annual earnings should increase by
that amount. Plus, analysts said, by allocating $7 billion to the
benefit funds, GM should receive a tax credit of about $2.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   GM could have contributed the $7 billion in cash, but by using
its Hughes interest instead, the company keeps that capital handy
for other possible deals, including acquisitions. GM shareholders
will be able to swap their stakes for Hughes stock in a tax-free
exchange. Those who hold the Hughes tracking stock may benefit from
the rise in the stock's liquidity, which is now less than the
average for a large-capitalization, high-growth stock.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Smith, the chief executive of Hughes, who is the brother
of the GM chairman, said of the deal announced Tuesday: ``It has no
impact'' on Hughes' current business plans.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley will advise GM in the deal, and Salomon Smith
Barney will advise Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hughes executives formulated a new business plan that
envisioned moving Hughes from diverse businesses including
satellite manufacturing towards service-based digital
entertainment, like DirecTV. The Hughes team presented its plan to
GM's board in December, and won approval for the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We immediately commenced execution of that plan,'' said
Pearce.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, GM sold Hughes' satellite manufacturing operations
to the Boeing Co. for $3.75 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Tuesday came after the GM board, in its regular
meeting, approved the deal. The board has been discussing the
succession to Smith, the GM chairman, but no announcement was made
Tuesday on that subject. Leading contenders include Pearce, who is
recovering from leukemia, and G. Richard Wagoner Jr., GM's
president.

   NASHUA, N.H. _ Steve Forbes' disappointing third place finish in
the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday makes it even more difficult
for him to establish himself as his party's conservative
standard-bearer, especially in light of the lavish amounts of time
and money he spent here.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' showing was close to the 12 percent he gained here four
years ago. And it was well under the 20 percent that the Forbes'
campaign had earlier predicted he would get after his solid second
place showing in the Iowa caucuses last week.
</P>
<P>
   With Forbes digging deep into his own personal fortune, his
campaign says that he still has the money, and the message, to keep
his candidacy going into the next ground of primaries. And, they
say Sen. John McCain's decisive victory here opens the field to any
number of unexpected outcomes in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our big problem in New Hampshire has been stripping
conservative voters from Bush,'' said Greg Mueller, the Forbes'
campaign communications director. ``A lot of people voted for him
because they thought he was the inevitable candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's loss ``opens up the whole conservative field,''
Mueller added. ``It will be tough, but doable.''

WHITE HOUSE WOULD WEIGH DIPLOMATIC ISOLATION OF AUSTRIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (With AUSTRIA-EUROPE, AUSTRIA-REACT) 
(mk) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House officials said Tuesday that the United
States would consider joining the European Union in diplomatically
isolating Austria now that the Freedom Party, which espouses an
anti-immigrant platform, and the People's Party have agreed to form
a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council, said
the United States would weigh a range of options _ including
curtailing diplomatic relations _ if the Austrian president accepts
the Freedom Party, led by Joerg Haider, as part of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should this occur, we would examine carefully the range and
depth of our bilateral relationship, and consider similar steps to
those identified by the Europeans,'' Leavy told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's party came in second in elections held in October, with
27 percent of the vote. Haider has called for a curtailment of
immigration to Austria _ ``over-foreignization,'' in his words. He
also advocates a halt to the expansion of the European Union as a
way to keep more Eastern Europeans from entering Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Most controversial, Haider has made comments, for which he
subsequently apologized, that were viewed by critics as playing
down the crimes of the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union, in an unprecedented move on Monday that
caught Austrian leaders off guard, warned that its other 14 members
were prepared to isolate Austria to make clear their opposition to
the Freedom Party's views.
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said last week that
U.S. officials had made clear in meetings with Haider ``our strong
opposition to any statements or any actions that might be
interpreted as expressing sympathy for the former Nazi regime or as
explaining away in any way, shape or form the terrible tragedy of
the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   An official at the Austrian Embassy in Washington would not
comment Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a stark demonstration of the lure and the power of the
Internet, some of the nation's top law firms have raised pay for
associates by as much as 50 percent in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The move is the most recent part of a chain reaction that began
just before New Year's Day in Silicon Valley, where firms have lost
dozens of lawyers to dot-com start-ups, and is now spreading to the
white-shoe firms of New York. At least one top New York law firm
has matched the California raises, and partners at other firms
around the country have held impromptu meetings to discuss
salaries. Many are expected to offer big raises in the coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The pay increases will allow first-year associates to earn as
much as $160,000 a year, depending on their year-end bonus. As
firms simultaneously adjust the salaries of all other associates,
the payroll at a single firm could grow by tens of millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, more than a thousand lawyers will receive
the raises, and that number will multiply if more firms follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
   News of the pay increases has ricocheted around law offices
thanks to Internet chat boards, like Yahoo's ``Greedy Associates,''
where lawyers have been posting messages about developments at
their firms. The online discussions have, in turn, raised the
pressure on firms that have not yet offered pay increases, partners
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are now waiting to see whether other New York firms
follow the lead of Davis Polk &AMP; Wardwell, which told its associates
in the last week that it would essentially match the new Silicon
Valley salaries, according to lawyers at other firms and a copy of
an internal memo posted on the Web. Davis Polk employees did not
return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the handful of the most prestigious New York firms
match each other's raises.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new structure, first-year lawyers will make a base
salary of $125,000, and with bonuses, often for working long hours,
they can earn more than $150,000. Last year, beginning lawyers in
the Bay Area earned about $95,000 in base salary, plus bonuses of
around $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   At top New York firms during the 1990s, starting base salaries
rose from about $80,000 to about $105,000, where they stood until
this week. Many lawyers also received bonuses of about $10,000 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   With the latest raises, fourth-year associates at many firms
will be able to make more than $200,000, up from less than $150,000
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The steep cost of the raises have the potential to cut partners'
takes by as much as one-fifth. It will also very likely force
increases in the firms' fees, which already start at about $200 an
hour. Partners said, however, that they had little choice but to
try and stem the Internet brain drain and to keep rivals firms from
gaining a recruiting edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make it harder for people to leave us for
clients,'' said Tower C. Snow Jr., the chairman of Brobeck, Phleger
&AMP; Harrison, a San Francisco-based firm that saw turnover among
associates rise to 25 percent last year, from 12 percent in 1998,
as lawyers jumped ship for both legal and executive jobs at Ebay,
Etrade and an array of Web start-ups. Brobeck was among the firms
raising its salary structure recently.
</P>
<P>
   The approach, associates say, has its appeal, in large part
because much of the pay at Internet companies comes from stock
options that may be worthless. ``That much guaranteed salary is
going to make people think pretty hard'' about leaving, said Howard
Holderness, a seventh-year associate at Brobeck. ``A lot of
dot-coms fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the draw of the start-ups is fierce, in part because they
offer the potential for wealth well beyond what any law firm salary
could bring.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very difficult situation,'' said Alan C.
Mendelson, a senior partner at Cooley Godward, which has its
headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Many other professional service companies are facing the same
drain. Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton, McKinsey &AMP; Co. and other consulting
firms have begun taking stock in their clients more frequently and
plan to allow employees to invest in the pooled equity, in an
effort to mimic the skyrocketing stock prices of Internet
companies. Investment banks like Morgan Stanley Dean Witter have
raised salaries, in some cases offering restricted stock that
workers can redeem only if they stay with the company for at least
a few years.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For the law firms, the pay increases also reflect a new balance
of geographic power. For decades, New York firms attracted many of
the most talented law school graduates and paid them the highest
salaries. Firms in other cities largely reacted to salary decisions
made by New York firms.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, however, the gap between San
Francisco-area salaries and New York salaries has shrunk, and at
the most prestigious firms it no longer exists. In fact, the
current round of raises began at Gunderson Dettmer Stough
Villeneuve Franklin &AMP; Hachigian, a Menlo Park, Calif., firm, in
late December. Other Bay Area firms matched Gunderson last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You now have California setting a trend,'' said the head
partner at another large New York firm, who requested anonymity
because he said that commenting publicly would increase the chances
that his firm would have to match the raises. ``This has never
happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more significant, New York firms are now paying no more
than some California firms, where the dress code tends to be more
relaxed and associates generally work fewer hours.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, however, young lawyers at firms have less flexible
schedules than lawyers at corporate legal departments. With the
economy and stock market continuing to boom, and law firms'
revenues growing by 10 to 20 percent a year, associates are busier
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   That, in addition to the promise of Internet stock options, is
causing the increase in turnover. ``I wanted to be able to control
my schedule,'' said the general counsel of a dot-com company who
recently left a large law firm and who requested anonymity. ``I
didn't want clients to be able to control me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers around the country said they expected the decision by
Davis Polk _ the fifth-largest firm in the country, according to
the American Lawyer magazine's 1999 ranking _ to cause other top
New York firms, such as Cravath Swaine &AMP; Moore and Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom, to match.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers at Cravath and Skadden declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In cities where the cost of living is well below what it is in
San Francisco and New York and where there is less technology and
finance work, salaries can be considerably lower and firms are less
likely to match the raises, lawyers said. But some kind of raise,
on top of the usual annual increase that firms doled out at the end
of last year, is likely in other major cities, particularly those
with significant technology industries, such as Boston, Los Angeles
and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely reviewing it, and our salaries will
definitely change,'' said Janet Zagorin, the director of practice
development at Gibson, Dunn &AMP; Crutcher, a Los Angeles firm with
offices in New York, Washington and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   One option for firms is to raise salaries selectively. The San
Francisco-based Morrison &AMP; Foerster, for example, gave raises to
associates in its New York and Bay Area offices but not to those in
Washington or elsewhere. And Shearman &AMP; Sterling, based in New
York, increased pay only in its Menlo Park and San Francisco
offices.

JUDGE GIVES FORBES SPOT IN PRIMARY

 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Describing the rules for New York's Republican
presidential primary as infuriatingly unfair, a federal judge
Tuesday forced the party on Long Island to drop its attempt to toss
Steve Forbes from the ballot and suggested that he would soon allow
Sen. John McCain to qualify across the state.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Edward R. Korman of Brooklyn repeatedly
asserted that the state's election laws had been written to coddle
incumbents and party favorites by requiring underdogs to maneuver
through a maze of highly technical rules to get on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Korman, speaking at a hearing in a lawsuit brought by McCain and
Forbes to overturn the primary rules, expressed astonishment at how
election officials on Long Island disqualified Forbes from the
primary in three congressional districts. Local party leaders, who
are backing Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, filed the challenges to
the Forbes nominating petitions, and in the judge's view, went out
of their way to ensure that the Forbes campaign would have to go
through the process almost blindfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials in Nassau County, who are beholden to party
leaders, did not even notify the Forbes campaign that its petitions
were being challenged, so it was unable to present a defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty hair-raising story that they're telling about
how those objections were handled,'' Korman said, adding later: ``I
just find this method of operation shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   After the judge made clear that he would order Forbes on the
ballot if the local leadership did not relent, it abandoned the
challenges. Forbes is now on the ballot in all 31 districts in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The federal case has become increasingly significant for McCain,
whose candidacy received a remarkable lift from his easy victory in
the New Hampshire primary last night. Despite his strong showing
there, he is on the ballot in only 19 New York districts because
the party establishment used the ballot-access rules, which are
considered the most complicated in the nation, to challenge his
petitions.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for McCain have asked Korman to place him on the ballot
across the state, contending that he failed to qualify in all
districts because the rules were too arduous. The judge is expected
to rule as early as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The federal case has been unfolding as the three candidates have
been skirmishing in state courts over the specific challenges to
petitions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had expected to appear on the ballot across the state, in
part because McCain and Forbes had pledged not to challenge other
candidates' petitions. The Republican State Committee, which is
overseeing the Bush campaign in the state, had promised not to file
objections against Forbes, but no such promise was made for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on Long Island, though, decided to go after Forbes
on their own. That provoked a swift response from the Forbes
campaign, which declared that the nonaggression pact had been
broken and filed court challenges against Bush petitions in six New
York City districts, alleging widespread fraud. The Forbes campaign
has since dropped one district from the case, and a state judge is
now hearing testimony involving the other five.
</P>
<P>
   So in an odd twist, Korman could succeed in getting McCain and
Forbes on the ballot across the state, while Bush might not be. The
Forbes campaign says no matter what happens in the federal case, it
will not drop its challenges to the Bush petitions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current rules, candidates are required to collect
signatures of one-half of 1 percent of the registered Republicans
in the district. The judge is considering reducing the threshold to
one-tenth of 1 percent.

   To experience black history in progress, just step out the front
door. Look and listen. Almost every mode of pop music is grounded
in African American music forms. Everyday fashion statements such
as baggy jeans, flashy boxers and big, fat sneakers are direct
lifts from hip-hop couture. And much of our most fashionable
non-techie slanguage _ the kind that eventually makes it into
Webster's Dictionary _ hails from black America, not old Europe.
</P>
<P>
   When we stop to think, we remember these things. But we don't
stop to think often enough. That's where Black History Month comes
in. This four-week holiday of learning has been around since Carter
G. Woodson established it on Feb. 19, 1926 _ it was known then as
``Negro History Week'' _ but the possibilities for exploring its
richness have never been more diverse and accessible than they are
today.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Internet has opened the door to new ways of
researching the cultural contributions of African Americans. In
fact, there's so much information and so many resources out there
that it's easy to get lost. To help you on your way, we've provided
a starter list of sites documenting the black American journey.
Have an enlightening and rewarding trip.

LONG-TERM LYME DISEASE STUDY IS ENCOURAGING ABOUT SYMPTOMS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Conn., N.Y.)  (jw) 
 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the largest study of the long-term effects of Lyme disease,
patients who received conventional treatment report no greater
level of health problems years later than those who never had the
disease, researchers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elyse G. Seltzer, the principal author of the study, said it
should ``reassure both patients and physicians that the prognosis
for most patients with Lyme disease who receive conventional
antimicrobial treatment is excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, reported in the current issue of the Journal of the
American Medical Association, was organized by a team of
Connecticut doctors and conducted at the Yale medical school.
</P>
<P>
   But an opposing group of doctors not connected with the study,
among them Dr. Brian A. Fallon, associate professor of clinical
psychiatry at Columbia University and director of Lyme disease
research at New York State Psychiatric Institute, contends that
chronic or recurring Lyme disease in general is underrecognized.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon argues that the current study does not clarify the
problem of patients in whom the disease persists but whose symptoms
are not recognized or treated, with severe consequences, for long
periods after the symptoms first appear.
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer said the survey included 678 patients whose cases of
suspected Lyme disease were reported to the Connecticut authorities
from 1984 to 1991; a random sample of 212 patients was taken from
that group and compared with 212 people of the same age who did not
have Lyme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although many patients reported increased symptoms or
difficulties with typical daily activities between one and 11 years
after diagnosis of Lyme disease, the frequencies of such reports
were similar to those among age-matched controls without Lyme
disease,'' Seltzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 678 patients, 64.3 percent met what is called the
``national surveillance case definition'' for Lyme disease; more
than 85 percent of the 678 were treated with antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   In both of the groups of 212 people whose case histories were
compared, an increased frequency of pain or difficulty with daily
activities like housework or exercising was reported among about 69
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon, of the opposing group of doctors, cautioned that ``no
firm conclusions could be draw from the Yale study because of the
limitations of the design.'' He pointed out that the survey was
done by a research assistant, not a health professional, using a
questionnaire to collect clinical histories that he described as
having ``no established reliability.''
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Pierce Gardner, an
epidemiologist and professor of medicine at the State University of
New York at Stony Brook, said methods of diagnosing the disease
were not well standardized and varied by laboratory. Gardner said,
``Uncertainty breeds strong disparate opinions.''

BUSH'S CAMP SURPRISED AT SIZE OF LOSS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NH-REPUBS) 
(sw) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Gov. George W. Bush and his advisers were
never under any illusions.
</P>
<P>
   They knew that any betting man would put his money on Sen. John
McCain, who had put his entire candidacy on the line in this state,
to win its primary. They knew that they might wind up spending much
of Tuesday night finding both graceful ways to accept defeat and
expert ways to spin it.
</P>
<P>
   But what took them by nearly complete surprise _ and guaranteed
that their efforts over the next weeks would be seriously
re-evaluated _ was the kind of double-digit walloping that came
their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unpleasant'' was the terse description that one adviser used
for the feeling in his gut when the first exit polls came in. His
tone of voice suggested that the sensation was actually worse than
that.
</P>
<P>
   Another adviser said, bluntly, ``I think we were prepared for a
5-to-7 point loss. The dimensions of this are troubling. We worked
very hard. We wanted it really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their shock and palpable disappointment, Bush's advisers
exhibited little worry that McCain's success here would be repeated
in the next big primary, in South Carolina on Feb. 19, or that the
Texas governor would ultimately lose the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, too, seemed upbeat and unbowed when he addressed hundreds
of supporters in a gymnasium at St. Anselm's College here at about
8:20 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire has long been known as a bump in the road for
front- runners, and this year is no exception,'' Bush said,
referring to the state's famously quirky, contrary voters and their
habit of creating humbling surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Bush then made oblique reference to a fact that his advisers
underlined more boldly: McCain had focused his presidential
campaign almost relentlessly on New Hampshire, spending twice as
many days here as Bush did, and had done so at the cost of building
organizations in states with contests to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road to the Republican nomination and the White House is a
long road,'' Bush said. ``Mine will go through all 50 states, and I
intend it to end at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers said the defeat here represented something of a
wake-up call that would shape the campaign's upcoming efforts,
especially in South Carolina, which is where Bush would like to
draw a line in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   They said the campaign plans to focus greater attention on the
fact that the governor has been endorsed by 35 of the 55
Republicans in the U.S. Senate, the chamber in which McCain serves.
It is their way of answering McCain's implicit charge, in speeches
and commercials, that Bush is not ready to lead the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers blamed themselves for not doing a better, more
aggressive job of debunking McCain's claim that Bush's proposed tax
cut left too little money for Social Security, and they said that
they would not make the same mistake in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   There were other strategies being considered and hatched as
well. Campaign officials in South Carolina foresaw a rally on
Thursday, in Sumter, to showcase Bush's extensive support from
veterans groups, a sort of counterpoint to McCain's military
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   One adviser said that Bush may appropriate one or two of
McCain's themes, talking more about voter apathy and the corrupting
influence of money in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The adviser noted that after the Christian minister Pat
Robertson finished ahead of Bush's father in the Iowa caucuses in
1988, Vice President Bush ``brought in Loretta Lynn and Crystal
Gale and rode around on a bus in South Carolina and talked about
God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the threat becomes serious enough to endanger you, you
adopt and steal their message,'' the adviser said.

HEALTH WEB SITES FAIL TO KEEP PERSONAL DATA PRIVATE, STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Internet health sites collect some of the most
personal information about their users, but few follow their own
declared policies about maintaining the privacy of that data,
according to a survey made public Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, by the California HealthCare Foundation, found that
19 of the top 21 health sites had privacy policies but that most
failed to live up to promises not to share information with third
parties. And none of the sites followed guidelines like those
recommended by the Federal Trade Commission on collection and use
of personal data.
</P>
<P>
   The survey comes as policy makers are more closely scrutinizing
the privacy practices of Web sites to determine whether new laws
are needed to regulate online marketers. Privacy advocates
immediately cited the findings as proof that the Internet industry
had failed in its efforts to police itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the 7,000th piece of conclusive evidence that
self-regulation is not working,'' said Jason Catlett, founder of
the Junkbusters Corp., a company that helps people protect their
privacy online.
</P>
<P>
   The study's authors were less judgmental, comparing the online
health industry to an awkward adolescent. Richard M. Smith, an
Internet security analyst, and Janlori Goldman, director of the
project, said health sites were well aware that consumers expected
the information they supplied to be confidential. They said they
believed that many sites were unaware that third parties could gain
access to the information they were collecting.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for the privacy violations, Smith said, is the
use of so-called cookies, which track consumers' movements on the
Internet, and other advanced technology that delivers advertising
to Web pages and can pick up information entered by users on pages
where the advertisements are displayed. The combination allows
advertisers to build detailed profiles of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Smith said a site promising not to share its users'
names, addresses or other information had contracted with a company
to administer a health assessment test on the site, providing that
company with access to the data.
</P>
<P>
   Catlett said it was plausible that many sites were unknowingly
violating their own privacy policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these sites are being set up in great haste, and
often without sufficient knowledge or attention to the leakage that
takes place with online advertising,'' Catlett said.
</P>
<P>
   Although privacy advocates for years have been calling on
Congress to pass a law setting standards for Internet sites to
follow when collecting personal information, the Clinton
administration and the Federal Trade Commission have sided with the
industry in its call for a chance to prove that marketers and
online merchants can police themselves.

   Law Firms Raise Salaries to Compete With Internet
</P>
<P>
   Some of the nation's top law firms have raised salaries for
associates by as much as 50 percent in the last week in a stark
demonstration of both the lure and the power of Internet. The move
is the most recent part of a chain reaction that began last month
in Silicon Valley, where firms have lost dozens of lawyers to
dot-com start-ups, and is now spreading to the white-shoe firms of
New York. At least one top New York firm has matched the California
raises, and partners at other firms around the country have held
impromptu meetings to discuss salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Another Opinion on Microsoft Suit
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard legal scholar, told the judge in the
Microsoft antitrust case that the company's decision to bundle its
Web browser into the Windows operating system had ``obvious
benefits'' to computer programmers and consumers. But he then
proceeded to provide a legally innovative map for determining that
the bundling strategy violated the law.

   A Second Act for CMS Energy
</P>
<P>
   Having almost gone broke in the 1980s, CMS Energy _ the parent
of Consumers' Power _ wowed Wall Street in the 1990's by going
global and expanding into almost every part of the energy industry.
But that love affair appears to be over, or at least experiencing a
crisis. Facing heavy debts and weaker profits from international
operations than expected, CMS disclosed a restructuring plan that
would slash dividend payments while raising cash by selling a
tracking stock tied to its utility business.

   Reports Reinforce Inflation Fears
</P>
<P>
   The industrial sector grew in January for the 12th consecutive
month, the National Association of Purchasing Management said in a
report that raised inflation worries. Separately, the Commerce
Department said construction spending surged 2 percent in December,
pushing the amount of money spent on building single-family homes
to a monthly record.

   Shares of France's Valeo Fall 10 Percent
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders in Valeo of France, a large automotive parts
company, sold heavily on news that it would cut 6,000 jobs, or 12
percent of its work force, in the next two years.

<P>
   France Adopts Shorter Workweek
</P>
<P>
   Strikes crippled subway and bus service in Paris on the day when
most French companies were to begin adopting a shorter workweek,
down from 39 hours to 35 hours.

MANNESMANN AND VODAFONE CHIEFS TALK ABOUT A FRIENDLY MERGER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS with ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Klaus Esser, the besieged chief executive
of Mannesmann AG, Tuesday discussed the possibility of a friendly
merger with Chris Gent, the head of Vodafone Airtouch PLC, people
close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Mannesmann cautioned that the two
telecommunications companies are still deeply divided on an
agreement that would bring a peaceful resolution to Vodafone's
all-stock hostile takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
   But one person involved in the talks described them as
``constructive'' and predicted that the companies would reach an
agreement before Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional investors, increasingly convinced that Vodafone
will be successful one way or another, sharply bid up the price of
Mannesmann shares Tuesday for the second day in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann shares climbed 4.7 percent to a new record high of
290 euros or about $281 Tuesday, while shares of Vodafone climbed
6.4 percent to 360 pence or about $5.80 in London, raising the
value of the deal to about $160 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that activity represented trading by arbitrageurs in the
United States, who have been pouring money into Mannesmann shares
ever since Vodafone announced an alliance on Sunday with Vivendi SA
of France, Mannesmann's longtime partner in the wireless
communications industry.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond simply bidding up Mannesmann shares, American
arbitrageurs are now waging a whispering campaign aimed at
convincing other institutions to tender their shares by Wednesday
or Thursday rather than waiting until Vodafone's deadline on Feb.
7.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann executives have repeatedly denied the arbitrageurs'
assertion, which is based on the theory that Europe's system for
clearing stock transactions takes several days.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, analysts say Esser is under growing pressure to
cut a deal. Vodafone's offer expires next Monday and Gent has
previously offered to sweeten his bid slightly if Mannesmann's
management drops its defenses and recommends the deal to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   In a friendly deal, Gent has said, Vodafone would raise the
offer so that Mannesmann shareholders would receive 49 percent of
the combined company rather than 47.2 percent under the current
offer.
</P>
<P>
   If Esser refuses to budge on his demand that Mannesmann
shareholders receive at least 52 percent of the combined company,
he could risk sacrificing the additional premium while still losing
control to Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market thinks this is more and more likely,'' said
Alexander Blaich, an analyst in Frankfurt with Banque National de
Paris. ``My impression is that many Germans will not tender their
shares directly to Vodafone, but are selling out to others who will
be ready to tender their shares.''
</P>
<P>
   People close to the talks said Esser and Gent talked about a
possible deal Tuesday in Duesseldorf, home to Mannesmann's
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our belief is still that Vodafone will be successful, but
whether it has to upgrade the offer is another matter,'' said
Roderick Chisholm, a telecommunications analyst in London at Smith
Barney Salomon.

RECREATING `JANE EYRE' WITH A NEW INTIMACY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Matt Wolf is the London theater critic for Variety and a regular
writer on the arts from Europe.  
 By MATT WOLF

<TEXT>
<P>
   What is left to discover about ``Jane Eyre'' after at least four
film versions and various important critical writings, not to
mention Charlotte Bronte's 1847 novel itself?
</P>
<P>
   If you are in the theater, perhaps it is the opportunity to
dramatize a novel with great physicality while animating its
time-honored passions anew. That seems to be the case with Polly
Teale, the adapter and director of Shared Experience's stage
production of the novel that arrives on Tuesday at the Brooklyn
Academy of Music in New York.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Jane Eyre'' aims to provide bark _ there is an
anthropomorphized dog onstage _ as well as bite. Think of it as
Bronte unbuttoned. Here, the plain Jane governess who falls in love
with her employer, Rochester, is deeply tied to the disheveled
attic-bound woman she meets in the novel. That character, Bertha,
is less a separate figure of derangement in the play than the
volatile alter ego to the orphaned and destitute Jane.
</P>
<P>
   (The same view informs the influential 1979 book ``The Madwoman
in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the 19th-Century Literary
Imagination'' by Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar, although Teale
said she did not know the work until she had almost finished
writing.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to feel as if you see into the characters' souls,''
said Teale, 37, of the approach to the novel she wanted. ``It's
about going toward a terrific intimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   To that extent, her adaptation is of a piece with such Shared
Experience ventures as ``Anna Karenina,'' which earned warm reviews
during its visit to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1998. The
current production runs through next Sunday in the Harvey
Lichtenstein Theater.
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with the play, the BAM Rose Cinemas will show two
films based on the novel ``Jane Eyre'' and bearing the same title:
Franco Zeffirelli's 1996 version, with William Hurt, Charlotte
Gainsbourg and Joan Plowright, will be screened on Thursday; Robert
Stevenson's 1944 film, with Orson Welles, Joan Fontaine and
Margaret O'Brien, on Friday. Showings are at 4:30, 7 and 9:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the eight-member Shared Experience cast have changed
since ``Jane Eyre'' played in London in 1997. The Academy
appearance is the last stop on an international tour that began,
appropriately enough, in Yorkshire _ Bronte country _ before
traveling to Australia, Sri Lanka and, most recently, India. Penny
Layden and Sean Murray are the recent recruits as the governess and
her Byronic employer and eventual husband.
</P>
<P>
   What remains is an expressionistic, even proto-feminist ``Jane
Eyre'' _ although, Teale cautioned by telephone from India: ``I
would hate to think it was only of interest if you were a feminist.
This takes us closer to Bronte in some ways.''
</P>
<P>
   After researching Bronte's life, starting with her letters and
diaries, Teale said, ``You've only got to read a few lines to get a
sense of somebody who would have these fits of rage, someone with
this huge imagination and fierce intellect who was living at a time
when there were so few channels for any of that stuff.'' Teale
pursued this double trail: the reined-in title character at the
heart of the novel and the author's own clamped-down passions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Bronte's time, for a woman even to write seemed almost like
an illness,'' Teale said. ``Suddenly, it seemed like there had to
be a connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, no theorizing would count for much were ``Jane Eyre'' to
fail to deliver on the promise implicit in the name Shared
Experience. ``What Polly said is, `Don't think about it; do as you
feel,''' Murray said. ``That is a very freeing thing to do.''

PUSHING DANCE UNTIL IT OFFERS THE THRILLS OF A CARNIVAL RIDE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6) 
</HEADLINE>

 Valerie Gladstone's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was
about Ballet Hispanico.  
 By VALERIE GLADSTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since the Brazilian choreographer Deborah Colker
established her dance troupe in Rio de Janeiro in 1994, it has
attracted enormous audiences. ``Sometimes I'm criticized for being
too popular,'' she explained on a visit to Manhattan last November.
``But why else make dances, if not for everyone?''
</P>
<P>
   Her sleek, 14-member Companhia de Danca Deborah Colker makes its
North American debut at the Joyce Theater on Feb. 15 through 20
with the full-evening work ``Rota'' (``Route''), a hit in South
America and Europe that has been seen by more than 200,000 people
since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Rota'' opened in London last spring, the critics raved.
``Even as our jaw drops at her dancers' athletic daring,'' Debra
Crane wrote in The Times of London, ``we can appreciate their
stylistic grace. It is a giddying effect, a blazing ballet that
thrilled the first-night audience.'' Other reviews were sprinkled
with the words ``exalting,'' ``breathtaking'' and ``fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to imagine Colker, who is 39, doing anything
that isn't fun. Small and blond, she bounded into a coffee shop
exhilarated by a day of exploring New York. ``Music was first in my
life,'' she began, ``then volleyball, then studying psychology. My
father, a violinist and conductor, made certain our home in Rio was
filled with classical music. I studied piano for 12 years.'' But
music did not lead her to dance; sports did. ``To me,'' she said,
``movement means action and communication.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Colker signed up with the modern-dance troupe Grupo
Coringa, both as a dancer and a choreographer. Eight years later,
she went in another direction to become a movement director in
theater, television and music, a good introduction to the world of
rock concerts and music videos.
</P>
<P>
   Through teaching, she began to develop her own dance vocabulary,
already rich with the influence of ballet, modern, jazz and tap.
``I learned how to make the body intelligent,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Once she had her own company, Colker convinced Petrobras, the
Brazilian state oil company, to provide full sponsorship. It has
been a felicitous arrangement: she works in spacious studios, pays
her dancers good salaries and employs 50 people full time. Without
this financial support, she could not afford complicated sets, like
the climbing wall in ``Velox'' (1995), the 22-foot, 1.5-ton steel
wheel in ``Rota'' and the oversize jungle gym in ``Casa'' (1999).
Best of all, she can take her time choreographing, which means
spending at least a year on each piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like big themes,'' said Colker, ``but never ponderous
ones.'' ``Rota,'' inspired by a vacation at Disney World in Florida
with her son and daughter, is full of surprises. It has something
in common with both Elizabeth Streb's fierce, athletic works and
Pina Bausch's provocative dance theater, and even when viewed on
videotape it occasionally generated the rush of a Rolling Stones
concert.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the soundtrack resembles anything ever heard before.
Created by Colker with the musicians Berna Ceppas, Alexandre Kassin
and Sergio Mekler, it mixes Mozart, Schubert, Johann Strauss and
Miles Davis with the Chemical Brothers' ``Private Psychedelic
Reel,'' drums, theme music from the movie ``The Godfather'' and the
barking of Colker's four dogs.
</P>
<P>
   While the enormous backdrop looks like an aerial map, it is
instead a painting of a dress pattern, with circles and straight
and dotted lines. ``Rota'' represents a journey, an exploration of
space. ``Although the backdrop is a pattern,'' Colker said, ``it's
also meant to suggest antique navigators' maps, with lands and
routes that may or may not exist. We travel with this as a guide,
starting on land and ending in the air. Along the way, we have all
kinds of experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   She performs with her troupe. ``Deborah's work pushes you to
your limit,'' said Rico Ozon, a member of the company who trained
in gymnastics and with the Brazilian National Circus School.
</P>
<P>
   In the first act, Colker combines classical ballet vocabulary
with funky everyday gestures and movements, going on in the second
to evoke the weightless atmosphere encountered by astronauts.
Eventually, she arrives at the giant wheel on which her dancers
gently swing to a Strauss waltz. ``The wheel,'' she said as a
reminder, ``was one of man's first inventions.''
</P>
<P>
   Rising to leave the coffee shop, she said, ``Do you know what
makes me happiest?'' She paused. ``Eight-year-old's enjoy my work
as much as 80-year-old's.'' Isn't that the age range at an
amusement park?

SUNDANCE GIVES SIGNS OF RENEWAL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<P>
   PARK CITY, Utah _ We have come to expect a great deal of the
Sundance Film Festival, the independent film world's annual
gathering in the snowy, condo-packed valleys of the Wasatch Range.
</P>
<P>
   Besides offering a great confluence of buzz and celebrity, a
career-advancing opportunity for young filmmakers, a meat market
for agents-on-the-make, a bazaar for indie-film distributors and a
stage for artiste poseurs and hustler manques, it is also regarded
as the year's prime opportunity to take the pulse of American
independent filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's probably as good a measure as any that's out
there,'' said Robert Redford, the actor and Oscar-winning director
whose Sundance Institute sponsors the festival, which ended its
10-day run here a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Artistically, this was widely viewed as among the most
successful Sundances of recent years, with fresh and surprising
entries in all of the festival's categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Critics come to Sundance looking for something new and
different,'' said Jonathan Sehring, president of the Independent
Film Channel, which helped produce some of this year's festival
favorites, including ``Girlfight,'' the newcomer Karyn Kusama's
film about a Brooklyn woman who finds fulfillment in the boxing
ring. ``I think this was a great year for films at Sundance, much
better than the last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers, however, attributed this burst of good will to
the low expectations that many brought to the festival.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for this might be that few of this year's
festival films were screened in advance for potential buyers, said
Geoffrey Gilmore, co-director of the festival. ``What I find
particularly interesting and encouraging is that the films that
played the best in the marketplace were the ones that were more
original.''
</P>
<P>
   Film buyers and audiences have been subjected in recent years to
a flood of 20-something angst movies and quirky romantic comedies
from independent filmmakers. ``People get tired of independent film
genres in the same way they get tired of Hollywood genres, and they
start looking for something different,'' Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the films to emerge from the festival were clearly
geared for a mainstream audience _ Heather Graham playing a
newlywed with a fetish for fidelity in Lisa Krueger's ``Committed''
or Brenda Blethyn playing a British widow forced to grow marijuana
to make ends meet in ``Saving Grace,'' the film that fetched the
highest price at this year's festival (around $4 millon from Fine
Line).
</P>
<P>
   But others were a little more unusual _ Miguel Arteta's ``Chuck
and Buck,'' a shot-on-video comedy about mismatched friends with a
dark secret, or Isaac H. Eaton's ``Shadow Hours,'' about a
recovering addict working the night shift in a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   The current rap on independent films is that they are becoming
more mainstream, more slick, more like Hollywood. Such talk rubs
Redford the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've seen in recent years in independent films is an
increase in technical quality,'' Redford said. ``And that gets
blurred in some people's minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent filmmakers are, as a group, more proficient than
they were a half-decade ago, but critics who mistake this polish
for a commercial sellout are wrong, Redford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are far more elevated in technical quality than ever
before, which makes them look like mainstream films,'' Redford
said. ``And, yes, there are a lot of filmmakers working in
independent film who, in truth, really want to get to Hollywood.
But there is also a diversity of subject matter and a whole new
group of filmmakers emerging.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival has certainly grown since the mid-1980s, when most
of the activities were run out of one room and few people showed
up. Now it is bulging at the seams, spread across theaters in three
towns with a transportation and lodging network to rival an
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the most welcome announcements at this year's
festival was that Resort Theaters intends to build, in time for the
2002 festival, a new 10-screen cinema about five miles south of
Park City.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any major difference in the acquisitions market at
Sundance, it was the absence of Harvey Weinstein, the Miramax Films
chief who has dominated the festival in recent years, largely
through the prices he has paid and the way he has driven
speculation about which films were hot. ``Without Harvey being here
and with no one knowing where Harvey is, it's a very unusual
festival,'' Sehring said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Weinstein was in a New York hospital under another
name, fighting a bacterial infection that erupted during a trip to
St. Barts last month. Miramax inflamed speculation about
Weinstein's condition by declining to reveal the name of the
hospital or the exact nature of his condition, and rumors piled
atop rumors until Weinstein in absentia was almost as dominant at
this year's festival as he had been in the flesh in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Redford said he was resigned to the way the ``merchant
mentality'' had taken over much of the discussion about the
festival, and recognized that it was not altogether a bad thing for
filmmakers eager to have their projects financed. But he did not
care for speculation that this was what the festival had come to be
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've been true to our original mission,'' Redford
said. ``We're a festival. We're not a market. The fact that the
success of the festival has attracted the obvious characters is
just part of the deal. It's there, unfortunately, and it gets so
much attention. But it's not what we're about.''

 &HT;    State in a tizzy over One Florida plan
 &HT;    By Marcia Gelbart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ Something is going to happen in Miami this week.
Nobody is quite sure exactly what. Or where.
</P>
<P>
   Emotion, ego and partisan politics hurled lawmakers into a tizzy
Tuesday as it appeared that the fate of a critical hearing on Gov.
Jeb Bush's One Florida plan hinged not on policy or substance, but
on picking an agreeable location for the public to discuss its
merits.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the hearing was even declared dead, with a
co-chairman of the select legislative committee comparing the
hearing to ``a three-ring circus.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, throughout the frenetic hours _ which included talk of
sending 60 state troopers to Miami to maintain order _ Bush held
his ground and vowed not to retreat from the plan. By the day's end
he announced that he would make a personal appearance at the
hearing, no matter where it is held.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get my message out. The more people who hear my
plan,'' Bush said early in the day, the more people will ``hear my
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the governor's proposal to end race and gender
quotas and set asides in university admissions and state hiring and
contracts. The committee of 15 House and Senate members heard
public testimony Friday in Tampa, where dozens of speakers lashed
out at Bush for trying to end affirmative action. Another public
hearing is slated for Feb. 10 in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   For almost two weeks, Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas, a
Democrat, and Sen. Kendrick Meek, D-Miami, have urged the
Republican leaders of the House and Senate to move Thursday's
hearing in Miami from the county commission chamber, which seats
294. It is too small, they complained, since a crowd of more than
1,000 is anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   But in Tallahassee, their request fell on deaf ears. In part,
because legislators believed the chamber would be secure and suited
to controlling crowds.
</P>
<P>
   With their concerns still unaddressed, Penelas and Meek took
their case before the Miami-Dade County Commission Tuesday
afternoon. The commission agreed with them, and voted 10-0 to move
the hearing to the old 14,000-seat Miami Arena, a private facility
just a few blocks away. Commissioners also agreed to pay the $8,000
cost to hold the meeting there, and to provide police for security
and shuttle service between the chamber and the arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the host of the meeting, we want to be a gracious host, and
we're offering a free upgrade to a nicer facility,'' Penelas said.
He, Meek and others argue cramming a few hundred people into a
hearing room would make the hearing little more than a ``sham.''
</P>
<P>
   Penelas said he shared his intention to push the arena location,
before the commission voted, in phone conversations Tuesday with
Bush, House Speaker John Thrasher, and Senate President Toni
Jennings. All are Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's action infuriated Thrasher and one of his
lieutenants, Rep. Jerry Maygarden, a House leader who is a ranking
member of the select committee.
</P>
<P>
   Thrasher spokeswoman Katie Baur called the vote ``a blatant and
brutish display of partisan politics.'' She also blasted the Miami
Arena option as ``laughable.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, at 4:10 p.m. Tuesday, Maygarden said Thrasher had
pronounced the hearing dead, adding, ``This is not a rock
concert.'' Changing sites would violate House rules, which require
hearing notices of seven days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically blaming Meek and Penalas for ``a bit of jockeying
going on,'' Maygarden said, ``I'm a little bit embarrassed for the
good people of Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Meek _ who turned his protest of the plan into a national event
when he and Rep. Tony Hill, D-Jacksonville, held a 25-hour sit-in
inside the governor's suite two weeks ago _ also took a shot, this
one directed at Bush. ``The governor's office has done everything
to add drama to the Miami hearing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meek said he learned that an assessment Monday of security at
the commission chamber resulted in a call for 60 Florida Highway
Patrol officers. ``That's insulting,'' he said. ``Don't you know
what affect that has on the minority community?''
</P>
<P>
   At about 5: 15 p.m., the hearing was back on, though where, and
with what security presence, remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the intention of the senators on the committee to go to
a hearing as scheduled,'' said Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Palm Harbor,
who is chairing the committee with Maygarden. He said he also spoke
on Jennings' behalf. A third site under consideration is the Guzman
Center for Performing Arts, which seats 1,700 people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Bush spokeswoman Liz Hirst said Bush is
``planning to attend, no matter where.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rub remains with the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we don't care if Mayor Penelas is happy,'' Thrasher's
spokeswoman said. ``The hearing will be at the commission
chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   Penelas is holding to his opposition of the chamber location,
saying it is ``out of the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all a bunch of smoke and mirrors,'' he said. ``Are
they afraid of hearing the people? Is that it?''

SEARCH FOR FLIGHT 261 CLUES, SURVIVORS CONTINUES

<P>
   PORT HUENEME, Calif. _ Struggling to regain control of Alaska
Airlines Flight 261, the pilots wanted, needed to reduce altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Cleared to 17,000 feet, the tower told them at 4:16 p.m. Monday.
Acknowledged, came the reply. Air traffic controllers never heard
from the pilots again. An advisory only a minute later went
unanswered. Four minutes later, the jetliner dropped from radar,
federal investigators said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261, with 83 passengers and five crew members aboard, had
plunged nose-first into the Pacific Ocean about 40 miles northwest
of Los Angeles International Airport, where it had been cleared for
emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   While the search for survivors continued in the cold Pacific
waters and the bodies of three adults and one infant were pulled
from the sea by early afternoon, investigators from various federal
agencies sought to piece together the last moments of the doomed
flight. Hopes were slight, however, that anyone could have survived
a day in the 58-degree water.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said a pinging sound had been picked up in the
ocean, which likely came from the flight recorders that could help
unravel what went wrong with the MD-83. The National Transportation
Safey Board was also seeking the pilots of four other aircraft who
may have witnessed the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261 was enroute from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, for San
Francisco, and then Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In the first report of trouble, at 4:10 p.m., the pilots had
said they were having difficulty controlling the aircraft,
difficulty that they soon attributed to the horizontal stabilizer,
investigators said. The stabilizer, typically controlled by
automatic pilot but operable manually, is on the tail and controls
the pitch of the aircraft's nose.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses reported seeing the jetliner plunge vertically toward
the water, where an oil slick marked the point of impact Monday.
</P>
<P>
   US Coast Guard, Navy, and private vessels joined in Tuesday's
search, which was concentrated on a 36-square-mile debris field
about 10 miles offshore and as deep as 750 feet at some points. The
area was reportedly awash in heart-wrenching pieces of debris: a
lunch tray, carry on luggage, a leg attached to and nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   A makeshift morgue was set up at the US Naval Construction
Battalion Center, while the evidence and the passengers' personal
belongings were being catalogued and kept in a warehouse in Port
Hueneme.
</P>
<P>
   As the vessels moved in and out of Port Hueneme, someone erected
a 7-foot wooden cross as the memorial to the victims. Other locals
brought bouquets of flowers or stood in silent prayer. The families
of the victims did not make their way to Southern California,
instead choosing to gather in San Francisco and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still search for human life,'' said Coast Guard Vice
Admiral Tom Collins. ``The challenge is time. As time ticks off,
risks go up.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, a 10-member National Safety and Transportation
Board Team arrived in the coastal town to direct the investiation.
Safety Board member John Hammerschmidt, who led the news briefing
at a movie theater on the base, stressed that the recreation of the
twin-engine jetliner's final moments was based on a prelimary
transcript provided by air traffic controllers. He added, however,
that the conversations appear to be accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday, Seattle-based Alaska Airlines, which has the image
of an Eskimo painted on the tails of its airplanes, had gone a
quarter century without a fatal accident.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last year, the nation's 10th-largest airline had been
the subject of a federal grand jury investigation in Oakland
involving two of its aircraft, both MD-80s. A Federal Aviation
Administration report concluded that those aircraft were not
airworthy because of falsified repair and maintenance records,
according to press reports.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines officials said the fallen plane was not involved
in the investigation, which they noted focused on record keeping
rather than safety. It is appealing the $44,000 fine proposed by
the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an impeccable safety record and a maintenance record
that I would hold up to the industry,'' said Alaska Airlines Chief
Executive John Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate investigation reported by the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer, a grand jury probe was launched in 1998 in San
Francisco after a mechanics' union leader claimed maintenance
records regarding MD80s had been falsified.
</P>
<P>
   An MD-83 is a longer-distance version of an MD-80, and the
fallen aircraft was serviced Sunday, the day before the crash. It
underwent a maintenance check Jan. 11 and was checked more
thoroughly a year ago, said Alaska Airlines spokesman Jack Evans.
He said the accident rate for the MD-80 is 0.41 accidents per one
million departures, which aviation experts said is less than
one-quarter the industry average for all airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261 was commanded by two veteran pilots, Captain Ted
Thompson, 53, and First Officer William Tansky, 57, who had nearly
18,500 flying hours with Alaska Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure everyone knows that it would make my dad
happy to see how many people saw him as a father, a brother and a
friend,'' said Fred Thompson, 24, the pilot's son. ``And our hearts
and thoughts are with the families of the Alaska employees and
passengers.''

GORE EXPECTED TO EDGE BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN AND SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ With a down-to-the-wire finish, Vice
President Al Gore appeared to be edging out Bill Bradley to clinch
the New Hampshire primary, dashing the former New Jersey senator's
hopes for an upset here.
</P>
<P>
   The tightly contested race ensures that Bradley will not bow out
anytime soon, despite the Gore campaign's best efforts to drive him
away early with wins in both Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Bradley camp's continuing bitterness over Gore's
campaign tactics _ particularly his assault on Bradley's health
care proposal _ may fuel the Bradley organization in the coming
days. The former senator, who flew to Connecticut Tuesday night,
plans to continue questioning Gore's veracity and his ability to
win in November because of his involvement in the 1996 campaign
fund-raising scandals, according to a top aide.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates went all out to win in New Hampshire, spending
about 45 days apiece campaigning here over the past year. But
Bradley massively outspent Gore on television advertising, $3.3
million to $1.9 million since November 9.
</P>
<P>
   As they move past the first primary state, Gore and Bradley's
next major test will come on March 7, with 15 state primaries and
caucuses. Each candidate will have roughly $20 million available
with which to compete in California, New York, Massachusetts and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps sensing a loss of momentum over the past week, Bradley
issued a ``challenge'' Tuesday to Gore to hold debates once a week.
Gore had previously challenged Bradley to engage in debates twice a
week and to forgo all 30-second commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the offer is in the best interests of the country
and the party,'' Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign responded with a blend of openness and caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to link the debates to getting rid of ads,''
said Carter Eskew, Gore's media strategist. ``We want the debates;
we will debate.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of the Democratic primary reminds some of the story of
David and Goliath. When Gore first began campaigning for president
in New Hampshire last year, he seemed an unstoppable force, high up
in the polls, with all the advantages of incumbency and little
concern about a less well-known Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   For about nine months, Gore effectively ignored Bradley and
campaigned largely from Washington. He stood behind podiums on
platforms. He read from note cards. White House-style blue drapes
served as a backdrop for most of his appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bradley quietly worked the fertile New England turf.
He travelled extensively throughout the state, meeting with voters
in small groups and holding town hall meetings to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Sept. 5, the Gore campaign was rocked by news of a
Boston Globe/WBZ poll that showed Gore and Bradley in a dead heat
here. Bradley hadn't even begun to advertise.
</P>
<P>
   The realization that Gore would have to exert himself to win the
primary - as well as the nomination - brought massive changes to
his campaign. He moved his headquarters from K Street in Washington
to Nashville, Tennessee. And he began to listen to his supporters
here, who urged him to ditch his podium and talk to the voters with
Main Street walks and open meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also became more aggressive toward Bradley. First, he began
to acknowledge that he had an opponent. And second, he began to
criticize Bradley for quitting the Senate and for proposing what
Gore considered a flawed health care plan.
</P>
<P>
   Day by day, Gore chipped at Bradley's proposal with one
criticism after another. He said Bradley's plan would cost too much
and would spend the entire budget surplus without setting aside
money to save Social Security and Medicare. He said Bradley would
eliminate Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor and
disabled, and replace it with something that fell short of the
needs of the poor. And, most controversially, he said Bradley's
plan would be hardeste on African Americans, Latinos, women, the
disabled and people with the HIV virus by taking away their
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's charges largely went unanswered as Bradley believed the
accusations to be too outrageous for anyone to actually believe.
Bradley also said he was running a different kind of campaign, and
would not lower himself to respond to Gore's ``darts.''
</P>
<P>
   The criticism, however, took a toll on Bradley. Gore became
competitive in the public opinion polls once more and went on to
decisively win the Iowa caucuses despite an all-out push by
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Back in New Hampshire for the final week of campaigning before
the primary, Bradley finally launched his counter-attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``And my question to you is, why should we believe that you will
tell the truth as president, if you don't tell the truth as a
candidate?'' Bradley asked Gore during their last debate before the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``In politics, sometimes people make misleading statements
because they don't know any better,'' Bradley continued. ``You know
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, Bradley has attacked Gore's truthfulness in
characterizing Bradley's health care plan. He has attacked Gore's
participation in the campaign finance scandals of 1996. And he has
attacked Gore for not supporting a woman's right to an abortion
throughout his entire political career.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Gore accused Bradley of engaging in ``old
politics'' and the politics of ``personal vilification.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rocky week and tracking polls showing Bradley
sliding behind Gore, Bradley and his staff have maintained that
they can win the Democratic nomination despite the Iowa loss and
the close outcome in New Hampshire. They are sold on the message
that the nation urgently needs Bradley's ``new politics'' of bold
ideas and integrity, and they have the money to try to sell it to
the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   They believe the nation has yet to focus on the election and are
banking on Bradley to build some momentum to steamroll into the
March 7 contests.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Bradley aides had been bracing themselves for the
possibility of a lopsided loss in New Hampshire that could cripple
their ability to build that badly needed momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is scheduled to hit five states that hold primaries on
March 7 in the next three days, including the two biggest prizes:
New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was also slated to leave New Hampshire early Wednesday
morning for New York City. From there, the vice president will
travel to Ohio, California, and Seattle, Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to travel every day for the next month and a
half,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman.

FILING OFFERS A WAY TO FIND MICROSOFT VIOLATED THE LAW
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Wash., Mass., Iowa)   (jw) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Harvard legal scholar told the judge in the Microsoft
antitrust case Tuesday that the company's decision to bundle its
Web browser into the Windows operating system had ``obvious
benefits'' to computer programmers and consumers. But he then
proceeded to provide a legally innovative road map for determining
that the bundling strategy violated the law.
</P>
<P>
   The court filing, written by Laurence Lessig, a legal scholar
and software expert, came at the request of Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson. It offers a 45-page analysis of one issue: how antitrust
law on product ``tying'' should apply to the case. The
intellectually wide-ranging document, antitrust experts say, will
probably provide each side with some legal ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The Lessig brief had been eagerly awaited by the government,
Microsoft and antitrust experts. Unlike other filings, it is not an
advocate's brief, amplifying the arguments of one side or the
other, though Microsoft protested his participation in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig, a professor at Harvard law school and a fellow of the
Berkman Center for Internet and Society, did not come to a single
conclusion in his friend-of-the-court brief. Instead, he stated
that if a 1998 appeals court ruling in a related case applies in
this suit as well, then Microsoft did not engage in illegal tying.
But Lessig said that if the 1998 case did not apply _ and he raises
doubts that it does _ Microsoft might well have violated the law.
</P>
<P>
   A company is guilty of illegal tying if it makes consumers
accept a second product as a condition of buying a market-leading
product. The Justice Department and 19 states assert that Microsoft
did precisely that by bundling its Internet Explorer browser with
its Windows operating system. Microsoft asserts that the browser is
not a separate product but an ``integrated feature'' of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a federal appeals court ruled that Microsoft was free
to bundle its browser with Windows as long as it could make a
``plausible claim'' that bundling had some benefit to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But Lessig noted that the court was ruling on a ``consent
decree,'' essentially a contractual agreement between the federal
prosecutor and a potential defendant, so there was ``no reason to
read an opinion interpreting a consent decree as interpreting the
contours of antitrust law.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he observed that how tying law applies to software
was ``unsettled'' and added that the 1998 ruling was ``just one, if
prominent, manifestation of this uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Lessig suggested that tying doctrine had a hard time
dealing with software, since the relevant case law tended to deal
with physical products like cars and tires. If given a chance at a
software tying case, Lessig added, ``it is my view that there is a
significant probability that the Supreme Court will modify current
doctrine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides'' in the Microsoft case, he wrote, ``are too quick,
however, to minimize the difficulty of how tying law properly
applies to software products.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessig then suggests a different antitrust test for software _
that government or courts should not worry about bundling unless a
dominant company engages in what he calls ``strategic bundling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The aim of any antitrust inquiry,'' he wrote, ``should be
whether the particular bundle is a strategic bundle, aiming at
anticompetitive ends, not whether the bundle achieves its
interlinkage through contract or software.''
</P>
<P>
   Some antitrust experts say the Lessig brief may give Jackson the
legal blueprint he needs for concluding that Microsoft did violate
tying law. ``Lessig's brief supplies the judge with a sensible
rationale for finding there were two products and a tying
violation,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University
of Iowa law school. ``But that is not to say that Judge Jackson
will do that or, if his ruling is appealed, that the appeals court
will buy it.''

MCCAIN EASILY OUTDISTANCES BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Senator John McCain, a Vietnam war herowho
bet his presidential campaign on a strong New Hampshire showing,
rode a wave of support from independents Tuesday to easily defeat
the better-financed and much-endorsed Texas Governor George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In the storied history of the first-in-the-nation primary,
McCain's victory _ and the size of it _ may be one of the most
improbable.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was given little chance of winning the primary when he
entered the contest last year. As recently as last August, Bush led
McCain by 44 percent to 12 percent in a Boston Globe/WBZ-TV poll.
Indeed, McCain, who frequently mixed with his political patter with
self-deprecating humor, never tired of saying that he was once at 3
percent in polls that had a 5 percent margin of error, meaning that
his standing could be ``below zero.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain, who took to calling everyone here ``my dear
friends,'' made up the difference by conducting 114 town meetings,
touting his war record in a best-selling biography, and making
himself endlessly accessible to the public and press. He became a
fixture in the state, partly due to a strategic decision to skip
the caucuses in Iowa, where Bush spent many precious days.
</P>
<P>
   Despite McCain's victory, many analysts believe he still faces
an uphill battle against Bush. The Texas governor is the candidate
backed by most establishment figures, which worked against Bush
here but could help him in many other states. Bush has raised
nearly $70 million, compared to McCain's $13.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won overwhelmingly among independents who voted in the
GOP primary and, by a more narrow margin, he beat Bush among
Republicans, according to exit polls. McCain not only made headway
due to his maverick style and his war biography, but also because
he campaigned on several issues that appealed to independent-minded
voters. He called for an overhaul of the campaign finance system, a
massive effort to shore up Social Security and the elimination of
the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, bet his campaign on a huge tax cut program and
only began to talk significantly about Social Security and the
national debt in recent days, super-imposing a graphic about the
issues over his regular ads.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the defeat revived bitter memories of the way his
father, former President Bush, was badly bruised here in the 1992
primary, when Patrick J. Buchanan had a strong second-place
showing. Bush brought his father to New Hampshire for some
last-minute campaigning, but the imagery may have backfired.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's victory here is by no means is a sure path to the
nomination. New Hampshire voters are famous for their contrary
nature and independence, giving primary victories to Gary Hart in
1984 and Buchanan in 1996. In both those respective cases, the
better-established candidates, Walter Mondale and Bob Dole, went on
to win the nomination _ and lose the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's problems in New Hampshire became evident late last year,
when he refused to participate in a long-scheduled debate at
Dartmouth College. Bush's non-appearance, along with his relatively
light schedule in the state, did not sit well with many voters who
want candidates to adhere to New Hampshire's tradition of
accessibility and ``retail'' politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush not showing up at the first debate was definitely a
factor,'' said US Representative Charles Bass, a New Hampshire
Republican who backs Bush but warned him months ago about the
state's unpredictability. ``It gave McCain a free platform. I think
if Bush had to do it again, he would have gone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bass, like many Bush backers, doubted whether McCain's
success here will be equaled elsewhere. ``McCain ran a designer
campaign for New Hampshire...tooled to appeal to independents,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bass said the election marks a dramatic shift for New Hampshire,
which he attributes to election laws that allowed independents to
more easily vote in the primaries than before. The current law
allows independents to register at the polls as a Democrat or
Republican, and then switch back to independent on the way out.
Previously, Bass said, the process was more time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   Bush learned Tuesday afternoon that exit polling by the media
was signaling his defeat. He spent the afternoon at his hotel in
Merrimack with his wife and their twin teenage daughters. He had
started the day with a polling-stop blitz _ canvassing five polling
sites and a restaurant in three hours, starting at 6:30 a.m. _ but
gave up when it was clear the media cluster was preventing his
talking to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Before the polls closed at 8 p.m., Bush's Southeast regional
chairman, J. Warren Tompkins, had a piece of advice for his
candidate: ``Erase New Hampshire out of your memory and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Bush had been preparing for a defeat in New
Hampshire, despite his insistence, right up until Tuesday morning,
that he expected to win. But he also sounded like he was making
excuses for defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (McCain) made a decision to skip the first caucuses, and I
think Republicans need somebody who can run across the nation,''
Bush said at a campaign stop at the McKelvie School in Bedford.
``Its a long process. He has run a good campaign here, but so have
I. And I'm going to go to the next state, the next state, and the
next state, until I win our party's nomination. And then I'm going
to unite our party, and lead us to victory.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain alternated between confidence and caution Tuesday
morning. He had heard the news about Dixville Notch and Hart's
Landing, the two tiny towns that begin voting at 12:01 a.m.: the
combined vote in those towns broke down almost evenly, but not
quite. Bush garnered 17 votes, and McCain 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``The landslide has begun,'' McCain joked early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Little did he know, it had.
</P>
<P>
   For Forbes, the only good news out of the primary was that
McCain was victorious. Forbes had boldly predicted that he would
finish in the top two and that Bush would come in third. Forbes had
hoped to receive a boost in the polls after his strong second-place
Iowa finish. But Forbes' focus on the flat tax, his antiabortion
emphasis and his self-described ``charismatically challenged''
manner did not win over nearly enough voters. But Forbes said he
will not drop out of the race regardless of how he finishes in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The other two candidates, Keyes and Bauer, based their campaigns
on their strong antiabortion views, but had little hope of a strong
showing in this state where the majority of voters tell pollsters
that they favor abortion rights.

   CLINTON-ECON (Washington) _ President Clinton said Tuesday that
he was concerned about the nation's burgeoning trade deficit and
about the debt loads being carried both by individuals and
businesses, but he said his worry was tempered by the strength the
economy derives from the federal budget surplus. In an interview
with three news organizations on the day that the current expansion
became the longest on record, Clinton also gave credit to his
Republican predecessors for their role in promoting growth but said
that his push to eliminate the federal budget deficit had been
critical to creating today's prosperity. By Richard W. Stevenson.

INDEPENDENTS SEEN TAKING UP THE INSURGENTS' FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ There were only two things John McCain and
Bill Bradley had in common Tuesday: Insurgent campaign messages and
a tremendous amount of support from independent voters, whose
numbers altered the outcome of the nation's first primary.
</P>
<P>
   By a ratio of 3 to 1, according to exit polls conducted Tuesday,
independents chose McCain over rival George W. Bush; and they chose
Bradley, the former Democratic senator from New Jersey, over Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Cooke of Manchester was one of those independents for
Bradley. ``I'm voting for Bradley because I like his ideas about
health care and the racial divide,'' he said. ``He's also very
strong characterwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Manchester independent, Judy Vitale, voted for ``the
man, not the party,'' and that was McCain. ``I was a George Bush
person from the beginning, but I realized I was voting for his
father and not for him,'' she said. ``I realized he had nothing
specific to say about any issue and McCain did.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda L. Fowler, a Dartmouth College government professor, said
what happened in New Hampshire could be portentous, if independents
across the country continue to go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independents are a growing bloc of voters nationwide. It isn't
just in New Hampshire,'' Fowler said. ``If either one of them got
the nomination it would certainly be an advantage in the general
election to be able to inspire this kind of turnout among people
who tend not to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   In exit polls conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of
the Associated Press and television networks ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox,
and NBC, voters said they liked McCain's message of campaign
finance reform, shoring up Social Security, and keeping the
Internet free of taxation. However, in addition to conservative
voters, McCain also won over moderates and even liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's recent disclosure of a heart condition did not bother
those who supported him, the exit polls showed, although those
backing Gore overwhelmingly said his atrial fibrillation was a
factor.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of those who voted for McCain said they decided to
support him over the last year, a sign that his grass-roots
campaigning and 114 town hall meetings paid off throughout the
state.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, most of Bush's voters came to their choice more
recently, specifically since his landslide win in the Iowa caucuses
last week, after which he spent $418,280 on television ads in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's supporters were largely Republican loyalists _ including
many who supported Bob Dole in 1996 _ and some of the religious
right.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion was clearly an issue for Republicans Tuesday. Those who
are against it leaned toward Bush, while McCain voters held a range
of beliefs on the subject, perhaps reflecting the senator's own
varied responses during the final days of the campaign here to the
question of a woman's right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   Tax cuts were also a deciding factor, but mostly for Bush
supporters, 39 percent of whom said that should top the next
president's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think an enormous tax cut is a priority,'' Robert
Troendle, a Wolfboro optometrist, said last week. ``They
(candidates) don't understand us. Not to sound corny, but it's
honesty in government.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked which candidate says ``what he believes,'' only 17
percent named Bush, while 50 percent named McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, veterans turned out for McCain, a Vietnam
prisoner of war whose best-selling book, ``Faith of My Fathers,''
focuses on his family's military tradition.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 percent of voters told exit pollers that they viewed
McCain favorably, while about 57 percent of voters had a favorable
opinion of Bush. Few said it mattered that he was the son of a
former president.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, while independent voters also chose
Bradley, Gore received 60 percent of his party's registrants and
much union support.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also did better among liberals, who were not turned off
by his $65 billion health-care proposal. And 98 percent of Bradley
supporters said he could beat a Republican in the general election;
79 percent of Gore backers felt their candidate could survive in
November.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign had been the underdog in New Hampshire since
September, when polls began showing the vice president trailing
Bradley, who outspent his rival by more than $1 million here.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed voters split on whether Gore's ties to the
Clinton administration were a factor. And, although many political
analysts thought having Gore sit behind the president during last
week's State of the Union address would hurt the candidate, voters
said it helped seal their support for him.

COALITION DEAL BY AUSTRIANS DEFIES EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change Argentina to Chile re Pinochet in 19th graf; and to
correct spelling of Schuessel; Schuessel is correct) 
 (See also AUSTRIA-REACT, AUSTRIA-U.S.) 
(mk) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL JR.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Defying threats of diplomatic isolation by the
European Union and now the United States, the Freedom Party of
Joerg Haider and the People's Party announced Tuesday night that
they would form a government.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Austrian constitution, the makeup of any proposed
Cabinet must be presented to President Thomas Klestil, and the
parties said they would do that Wednesday. Klestil could still bend
to international pressure by asking for a new arrangement excluding
the anti-immigrant Freedom Party, but that was considered unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The People's Party failed in three months of trying to rebuild
its 13-year-old alliance with the pro-labor Social Democrats, who
came in first in the October vote. And it is widely acknowledged
that if the option of calling new elections were used, Haider would
probably win and become chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the European Union said that all its member states
would downgrade their diplomatic relations with Austria if Haider's
party, which they regard as xenophobic and extremist, was allowed
into government.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the United States joined the chorus, if a bit
obliquely, by saying that a government with Haider's party in it
``would affect our bilateral relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   What exactly will happen if Klestil says yes to a
``black-and-blue'' government _ the parties' colors are common
political shorthand here _ is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   At a long, late evening press conference, Haider seemed surer
than his coalition partner, Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel,
that the deal would hold. He called foreign attempts to stop the
government ``totally inappropriate'' but said, ``We will convince
those who expressed concern that their worries were in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by reporters, he said, ``The Freedom Party has no
sympathy for totalitarian regimes or Naziism.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel, whose party lost to Haider's by only 415 votes,
reminded other Europeans that ``we are not a semi-authoritarian
developing country.'' But, he conceded, ``We are really under the
microscope. It's a test phase for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The parties' roles in the new government were not described. The
recent assumption has been that Schuessel would become chancellor
and Haider would stay governor of Carinthia province and appoint
allies to the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians and analysts were pleased Tuesday that other
countries had threatened Austria, saying it was a statement for
democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Others were disturbed at the prospect of big countries joining
together to try to dictate the results of a free and open election
that gave Haider 27 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few days, Austrians have expressed frustration that
other nations would dare to dictate whom they could elect.
Austrians also feel that the foreign media whip up the specter of
Naziism in their coverage of Haider, whose appeal, they say, is
more complex than the simple accusations that he is a xenophobe or
an apologist for the Third Reich. Austria, in its 700-year history
as a nation and empire, spent seven years in the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thundering against the fascist danger is easier than informing
themselves,'' said Die Presse, a Vienna daily.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian national television showed a portion of a CBS News
broadcast Tuesday night that contained an old clip of Hitler. And a
CNN broadcast produced in London showed a clip of a lovely steeple
as a grave voice described ``the shadow of Naziism behind the
pleasant scenery and ordered life'' and characterized Austria's
complex imperial past as ``seeing itself as Europe's fortress
against undesirables.''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, as foreign reporters were chasing Haider across
the ski slopes while he celebrated his 50th birthday, about 600
neo-Nazis were marching under Berlin's Brandenburg Gate to protest
Germany's plans for a Holocaust monument. The English-language
International Herald Tribune, which is sold here, ran only three
paragraphs about it.
</P>
<P>
   Neo-Nazis never demonstrate here, as they do in the United
States and Scandinavian countries, nor are the homes of Turks
firebombed, as they are in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Vienna's tabloids run headlines screaming ``Austria is Not a
Nazi Country!''
</P>
<P>
   The European countries condemning them, Austrians point out,
have had full diplomatic relations with Stalinist, Maoist and
religious-fundamentalist dictatorships, Pol Pot's Cambodia and
Augusto Pinochet's Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Outside analysts are as divided as politicians are: ``The EU's
announcement didn't come as a surprise to me, but the strength of
it did,'' said John Palmer of the European Policy Center, a
Brussels, Belgium-based think tank. ``It shows that issues like
pluralism and anti-racism are now part of the European Union
fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alex Ashbourne, an analyst at the Center for European
Reform, a London counterpart, called the pressure ``absolutely
outrageous, and quite alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Haider was democratically elected by quite a number of
people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what roads this takes you down? What if the
Conservative Party here, which has a policy of withdrawing from the
EU, was elected again? Do they isolate Britain?''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the European Union had unexpectedly announced that
there would be ``no more business as usual in the bilateral
relations'' with any government integrating Haider's party.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian candidates for posts in international organizations
would find no support, it said, and Austrian ambassadors would be
received ``only at the technical level.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said there was no apparent legal or procedural problem
with the statement, even though the debate over it was closed and
there was no vote in the European Parliament. Essentially, he said,
all 14 countries were independently adjusting their foreign
policies toward Austria, but announcing it together.
</P>
<P>
   The rules for censuring a member of the European Union were
passed in a treaty negotiated in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, two
years ago, but the thinking then was to have them ready in case
eastern European countries were admitted and then had military
coups or began persecuting their citizens, said Charles Grant of
the Center for European Reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can't possibly apply those sanctions to Austria,'' he
said. ``It's a squeaky clean democracy, with free elections, a free
press and so on.''

ANALYSIS: N.H., RELISHING ITS ROLE, UPSETS THE APPLE CART _ AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
 (With NH-REPUBS, NH-DEMS and sidebars) 
(nk) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ It was not a great night for the dauphins of
2000, though worse for George W. Bush than for Al Gore, and the
results suggested strongly that both parties now face long, costly
struggles for their presidential nominations. As they have so often
before, the voters of New Hampshire upset the apple cart of
conventional wisdom, throwing both races into doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the governor of Texas, has far more money than the man who
trounced him here, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, and he has better
organizations in most of the states whose Republican primaries come
next. For now, he remains the favorite, but McCain's victory _ not
only the fact but also the size of it, which staggered the Bush
camp _ dealt a painful blow to Bush's principal stock in trade: the
notion that his nomination is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Bush get much traction from the argument, constantly
voiced by his supporters if not by the candidate himself, that he
is the Republicans' most likely winner in November. Voters in the
Republican primary split nearly evenly as to whether Bush or McCain
would make the stronger nominee.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won because voters in the Republican contest said that
what mattered most to them was finding a man of unshakeable
character, willing to stand up for his convictions. McCain filled
that bill for them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine, a Democrat, built a
seemingly unstoppable campaign on the same basis as Bush did this
year, amassing handfuls of endorsements like Bush. But he did
poorly in New Hampshire and never managed to regain his momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll asked
Republicans who expressed a preference for Bush whether they would
consider switching to McCain if he began to win primaries. More
than 40 percent said they would.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush promised Tuesday night in his concession statement to
campaign in all 50 states, dismissing New Hampshire as a mere
``bump in the road.'' He said he would be a better candidate for
having faced competition here, and described South Carolina, where
Republicans vote on Feb. 19, as Bush country.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had hoped to halt the challenge of former Sen. Bill Bradley
of New Jersey in the Iowa caucuses and in the primary here. He
failed, and as a result, he faces clusters of tests in states
across the country, starting in early March. Gore has the
organizational edge, but Bradley can come close to matching him
dollar for dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides expect a struggle, with more of the mutual
questioning of motives that marked the final week here, even though
Bradley expresses disdain for what he calls ``politics as usual''
(read mud-slinging). The more personal and belligerent the contest
becomes, the greater the potential damage to the eventual victor.
In years past, such damage has proved a major handicap in November.
</P>
<P>
   If the rest of the nation behaves like New Hampshire, this could
prove to be an outsiders' year. But this state's electorate is
quirky, with an unquenchable thirst for mavericks and rockers of
boats. For example, former Sen. Paul Tsongas, who won here in 1992.
had trouble repeating his victory elsewhere. In the past it has
often come to idiosyncratic conclusions, at least partly because it
gets a much closer look at the candidates than any of the other
states do.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire has never been particularly kind to candidates
with names made famous by their relatives. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., did poorly here. So did former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of
California and, much further back, Sen. Robert A. Taft of Ohio.
Eugene J. McCarthy, the anti-war insurgent, proved a much better
fit in the momentous 1968 Democratic primary, which helped drive
President Lyndon B. Johnson from office.
</P>
<P>
   Another atypical aspect of New Hampshire is its election law.
This state permits voters who are registered in neither party to
vote in either the Republican or the Democratic primary, and exit
polls indicated that these independents had been crucial in
McCain's astonishing sweep.
</P>
<P>
   More than four voters in 10 in Tuesday's Republican balloting,
not much less than half, said that they were independents. McCain
beat Bush by better than 3-1 among those voters, providing most of
his margin of victory. Among registered Republicans, McCain
prevailed more narrowly, the exit polling showed.
</P>
<P>
   That pattern will not be repeated in most of their subsequent
contests, simply because most states exclude independents from
primary elections. But if McCain could somehow win the nomination _
a gargantuan ``if,'' to be sure _ his strength among independents
would be a significant advantage in the general election,
especially against Gore, who is seen by many voters as a deeply
partisan politician.
</P>
<P>
   Exuberant, McCain said the results here marked ``the beginning
of the end for the truth-twisting politics of Bill Clinton and Al
Gore.'' His victory, he added, was the start of ``a great national
crusade.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also benefited from the votes of independents, but fewer
of them voted in the Democratic than in the Republican race. Nearly
two in 10 of the Republican voters said they had flirted with
voting for Bradley before deciding, many of them at the last
minute, to back McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Still, independents voting in the Democratic contest, some of
them people who said they were exasperated with Clinton, gave
Bradley an indispensable lift. Without them, Gore, with strong
backing from union members, hard-core Democrats and women, would
have swamped him.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Andrew Smith, the director of the University of New
Hampshire Survey Center, said that McCain's Vietnam War record and
his backing of campaign-finance reform had convinced New Hampshire
voters that he was ``a stand-up guy.'' Campaign finance itself was
not a big issue, he said, but McCain's willingness to buck his
party redounded to his credit.
</P>
<P>
   A number of voters said that they had voted tactically.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Ciarla, a 26-year-old teacher from Derry, explained: ``I'll
be voting for Al Gore in the general election, but I voted for the
next best guy today, John McCain, so George Bush doesn't show
strongly in New Hampshire. A lot of people think Bush is a shoo-in.
If it turns out to be Gore and McCain when I vote for president in
the fall, I'll be a happy man.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was by no means the first time that independents pouring into
the Republican race have played a major role in the New Hampshire
primary, the first in the nation. In 1996, they divided their votes
between Lamar Alexander and Pat Buchanan, which effectively denied
Bob Dole a victory. Similarly, in 1992, independents divided their
votes between President George Bush and Buchanan, shocking the
party, emboldening Buchanan and contributing to Bush's defeat that
November by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's victory was not only broad but deep. He was preferred,
according to the exit polls, by men and women, young and old, rich
and poor, those with advanced educations and those without, those
who had served in the nation's armed forces and those who had not.
</P>
<P>
   But the story was different in the Democratic balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Gore held the line among traditional Democratic groups, notably
trade union members, and ran strongly among women. More men voted
for Bradley, as did those with graduate degrees, presumably
including a significant share of the workers in the state's
expanding high-tech industries. Those with college degrees and
those with no degrees at all tended to opt for the vice president.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Tuesday that he was
concerned about the nation's rapidly growing trade deficit and
about the debt loads being carried by individuals and businesses,
but he said his worry was tempered by the strength the economy
derives from the federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview about the economy with three news organizations
on the day that the current expansion became the longest on record,
Clinton also gave credit to his Republican predecessors for their
role in promoting growth, but said that his push to eliminate the
federal budget deficit had been critical to creating today's
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   During the half-hour interview in the Oval Office, arranged at
the instigation of the White House, Clinton was expansive in
discussing the roots of the long business expansion, the problems
that face the economy and sparring between the two parties over how
to handle the growing federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   He brushed aside an aide's attempt to end the session to answer
a question about Vice President Al Gore's role in setting the
administration's economic policy, saying that the more people know
about Gore's involvement, ``the more credit he'll get.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he should get the credit for the expansion, which
has reached 107 months, Clinton said it was ``an American boom.''
</P>
<P>
   He ticked off factors including a general reorganization of the
private sector starting during the 1980s, the dizzying advances in
technology and the Federal Reserve's skillful conduct of monetary
policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan and Bush administrations, he said, deserved credit
for pushing a free-trade agenda. Doing so, he said, had forced
American industry to become more competitive, and by stimulating
imports had acted as a ``powerful brake on inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton stressed the role played by his administration's
efforts, starting in 1993, to reduce and then eventually eliminate
the deficit. He said he had built on that achievement by further
opening foreign markets, dealing with international financial
crises and overhauling the laws governing fast-changing industries
like telecommunications and financial services.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these things, even before they were actually felt, helped
to create a mind-set of confidence, which it seems to me is
critical for keeping the recovery going on this long,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what might endanger the expansion, Clinton talked about
the trade deficit and what some economists think is a worrisome
level of debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's highly unusual for a country to have a budget surplus as
big as ours and a trade deficit this big,'' Clinton said. Based on
figures for the first 11 months of the year, the trade deficit for
1999 is on course to reach $267 billion, about $100 billion more
than 1998, which was itself a record year.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I worry a little bit about the impact of the trade deficit
that big for a long time,'' Clinton said. ``That's one of the
reasons I hope we can get China into the WTO and open that market
more, because it's the biggest source of our troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then talked about the risks inherent in individuals' and
businesses' borrowing heavily in the belief that they can carry
more debt in an era when the stock market is making the country
feel wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about that,'' Clinton said. ``My concern is
mitigated by the fact that the government is in surplus and we're
paying down the debt and that lowers our risk a little bit _ quite
a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the money being borrowed by companies, Clinton added,
``will have a growth component to it and will increase the
long-term growth and stability of our economy'' because it will go
to investments in new equipment and technology.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said he remained concerned about the nation's
declining personal savings rate, which fell to 2.4 percent of
disposable income in 1999 from 3.7 percent in 1998 and 8.7 percent
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that no one seems to know how to fix in America
is how we get the personal savings rate back up,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can just keep moving in the right direction and realize
that this is a potential danger out there,'' the president said,
``I'm not as troubled by it as I would be if we were running a
deficit or if all this money was for consumer spending or if we
didn't have a better debt-to-wealth ratio than we do.''

 McCAIN WINS BIG VICTORY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Sen. John McCain won a landslide victory over
Gov. George W. Bush on Tuesday in the New Hampshire Republican
primary, defeating him by a margin far wider than anyone in any
either campaign had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's triumph was particularly exceptional because surveys of
voters on Tuesday found it was built not only on a core of
independents but also on wide and deep support among faithful
Republicans whom the Bush campaign considered its most reliable
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the race turns to Delaware, South Carolina, and then to
Michigan and Arizona, Republican strategists say the question is
whether McCain can propel his victory into a genuine challenge to
Bush. For months, the Texas Governor has been widely viewed as the
front-runner because of his towering financial advantage, his vast
endorsements from elected Republicans and his victory in the Iowa
caucuses last week.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain and Bush have for weeks sparred over the size of
their tax- cut proposals and the depth of their opposition to
abortion, the surveys of voters found that the most crucial factor
among the two-term senator's backers was that they viewed him as a
candidate of unshakeable character who was willing to stand up to
his convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but be amazed by the size of this,'' McCain
said from his hotel suite in Nashua after being told he had won.
``You can't help but be amazed by the size of this. It's across the
board, came from all sectors _ conservatives, moderates liberals,
women. It was a win for the message.''
</P>
<P>
   With nearly half the vote tallied on Tuesday night, McCain held
a lead of nearly 18 percentage points _ about 15,000 votes _ over
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides, seeking to capitalize on an outcome that was far
more lopsided than they had anticipated, immediately sought to step
up their fund- raising as a first step to quickly assembling
organizations in several states. They acknowledged that they could
never amass as much money as Bush, who has collected nearly $69
million, compared to nearly $14 million for McCain. But they said
they want to raise enough to compete aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   The results stunned Bush and his advisers, who for days had
happily predicted they would win here. Even on Tuesday morning,
Bush confidently predicted, ``I'm going to win.'' On Tuesday night,
at a rally in Goffstown, Bush emphasized that he was ready to
compete nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road to the Republican nomination and the White House is a
long road,'' he declared to subdued but cheering supporters. ``Mine
will go through all 50 states _ and I intend it to end at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting that McCain won not over the issues but because he
campaigned here almost nonstop for months, Bush, flanked by his
wife, Laura, and his twin teen-age daughters, said: ``He spent more
time in this great state than any of the other candidates and it
paid off. Tonight is his night and the night of his supporters. And
we all congratulate him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush stumped here 36 days; McCain 65. Behind the scenes, Bush's
aides were struggling to explain what happened, but insisted that
Bush's massive financial advantage would ultimately carry them to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The results on Tuesday night affirmed McCain's decision to skip
the Iowa caucuses. Steve Forbes, who finished second to Bush in
that contest, placed a distant third here on Tuesday night. He was
trailed by Alan Keyes, the former State Department official, and
Gary Bauer, a prominent religious conservative whom aides said was
weighing whether to withdraw. On Tuesday night, Bauer lavished
praised on Mr. McCain and congratulated him for his ``incredibly
stong'' showing.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's win set off a furious round of finger-pointing among
Bush's advisers over whether he neglected stumping here too long,
was too passive in his commercials and even over whether he erred
in campaigning here with his father on Sunday. Some campaign
advisers said that by standing on a stage with the former
president, Bush reinforced questions about whether he was riding on
his father's popularity and was ready himself to be president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stunning win for Senator McCain,'' said Steve Duprey,
chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party. ``The danger for
Bush of an insurgency campaign is that McCain has a brush fire that
he's going to try to turn into a wildfire. If Governor Bush had
beaten Senator McCain decisively it would have crippled, if not
mortally wounded, his campaign. Governor Bush may well survive a
loss. His challenge is to make sure that Senator McCain doesn't
score a series of victories.''
</P>
<P>
   The surveys of voters said independents turned out in force to
back McCain. More than 4 in 10 voters said they were independents,
an increase from 36 percent four years ago. Six in 10 of those
independents voters for McCain, while fewer than 2 in 10 backed
Bush and even less than that voted for Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Republican voters, half described themselves as
conservatives and they divided their votes evenly between McCain
and Bush. About 1 in 6 voters described themselves as very
conservative, about the same proportion who said they were part of
the religious right. Bush did well among this group, but not
resoundingly so. He captured about 3 in 10 votes among religious
conservatives while McCain and Forbes each took about 2 in 10 of
their votes.

   BC-INVEST-DIARY-$ADV30-NYT (moved on Friday, Jan. 28)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Friday, Jan. 28,
examined the performance of a closed-end fund, Engex, with a share
price that has almost tripled in the last three months because of
its large holdings in a single biotechnology company, Enzo Biochem.
</P>
<P>
   The article quoted an analyst, Evan Sturza, as expressing
skepticism about the prospects of Enzo Biochem; he called the
run-up in the stock a bubble. The Times should have asked whether
Sturza's firm helda position in the company's stock. The answer,
learned later, is yes _ a short position, meaning that the firm
stands to benefit if the shares decline.
</P>
<P>
   The article also misstated the name of his firm. It is Sturza's
Medical Research, not Sturza.

CONTRARIAN VOTE NOTHING NEW FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ On second thought, New Hampshire had second
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   This is the morning after _ the morning after a classic New
Hampshire primary, the morning after insurrectionary voters gave
new life to insurgent candidates _ and suddenly the political world
looks new again.
</P>
<P>
   The frontrunners might not be. The inevitable isn't.
</P>
<P>
   At least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Once again the fabled contrarians of this state _ the old men of
the mountains and the new entrepreneurs of the high-tech southern
suburbs _ delivered a blow to deference in both parties. They
rattled the party leaders' choices, defeating Governor George W.
Bush of Texas and granting only a modest victory to Vice President
Al Gore of Tennessee, even as they renewed the candidacies of two
party rebels, Senator John McCain of Arizona and former Senator
Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley, loser in a close race, survives to fight again,
McCain leaves the Granite State with a remarkable victory, one that
_ by virtue of the message, the margin and the man _ ranks as one
of the most striking political achievements in the storied history
of the New Hampshire primary. But for both insurgents, the fight,
until Tuesday conducted so efficiently in the compact precincts
squeezed between the Atlantic seacoast and the Quebec border, now
moves to terrain that favors the familiar and undermines the
position of the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two debates, begun in scores of town meetings and
community gatherings all over this state, now are poised to go
national. The first is a debate over whether the Democratic Party,
once the solace of the poor and the striving, should take up the
causes of its wealthy campaign contributors _ and present itself as
more the agent of the center than of reform. The second is a debate
about just how much the Republican Party, long the party that
resisted rebellion in American public life, should assail the very
establishment that nurtured, supported and financed it.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the newly reconfigured presidential election
almost certainly will give American voters new choices not only
about the direction of the country and the parties but also about
the nature of the liberal and conservative movements.
</P>
<P>
   After a frenzied campaign in a state that, for an extraordinary
seven-day period was transformed into a snowy political village,
the most formidable figure in presidential politics was upended
like a top-heavy ice sculpture. And in delivering a decisive
victory to McCain, Republican and independent voters here also
delivered a formidable rebuke to Bush, until Tuesday _ and until
New Hampshire _ widely regarded as the inevitable GOP nominee and
the best bet to win the first presidential election of the new
century.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gore's determined march to the Democratic
nomination was disrupted by the strong showing by Bradley, who has
raised uncomfortable questions about the Clinton-Gore
administration's coziness with big contributors and about the
political system's dependence on, and deference to, big money.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they did to former Vice President Walter F. Mondale in
1984 and Senator Robert J. Dole in 1996, the voters of New
Hampshire put a dent in the armor of the frontrunners. Even so,
Bush and Gore _ with endorsements, national organizations and the
support of the party infrastructure _ still hold the strongest
cards in the presidential poker game.
</P>
<P>
   But the performance of the two candidates in New Hampshire
revealed important weaknesses for both of them.
</P>
<P>
   In his campaigning in the weeks leading to Tuesday's primary,
Bush showed a tentativeness that was disquieting even to his
closest advisers and a lack of mastery that was unsettling even to
his supporters. He failed to reassure voters that he possessed the
reach and vision of his principal rival, and he was unable to
counter the powerful message delivered by McCain, who vowed to
break ``the Washington iron triangle of big money, lobbyists and
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Populist messages like McCain's have often played well in this
state, even in GOP primaries. But unlike Patrick J. Buchanan, the
conservative commentator who upset Dole in 1996, McCain is an
established political figure, a proven vote-getter and conventional
conservative. For those reasons, his triumph over Bush was far more
significant than Buchanan's victory four years ago. It was a
message to America, to be sure, but mostly a message to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the spirited but losing performance by Bradley, who
lacks the institutional muscle of Gore, revealed weaknesses in
Gore's campaign and in the vice president's political persona. In
his battle back against Bradley, who held the lead here for months,
Gore showed grit. In his attacks on Bradley, Gore showed
desperation. Indeed, he undermined his own position more than
Bradley's, making him vulnerable to charges that he skimmed the
truth in a frantic battle for advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wasn't alone, however; in the final days, Bradley walked
the same path, attacking Gore and opening to doubt his claim to be
a different sort of Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   And so stubborn old New Hampshire has delivered its verdict,
startling the strong, sustaining the weak. The appeal process
begins this morning.

POST MERGERS: A MODEST PROPOSAL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not even Valentine's Day, but recording companies are
getting mightly cuddly. Universal Music, owned by Seagram along
with Universal's movie and television companies, swallowed Polygram
in 1998, and late last year Time Warner announced plans to merge
with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Then in January, Time Warner announced it intended to take
control of EMI Music. Meanwhile, reports continue to circulate that
BMG is negotiating to buy Sony Music.
</P>
<P>
   That eventuality would swiftly halve the number of major
recording companies, from six in 1998 to three by 2001. In
addition, Time Warner's media empire would be linked to the
Internet glamour of America Online. It's a tectonic realignment of
the music business.
</P>
<P>
   Let other people worry about capital transfers, stock prices and
the sadly inevitable layoffs of workers and contract terminations
for musicians. The pertinent question is: What can all the
consolidation do for music fans?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody asked me, but here's what I'd like once the music
behemoths have changed their stationery and put up new signs on
corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, forget the cute stuff. No one needs a series of
tributes to EMI's Beatles catalog from the Warner Music stable or
Garth Brooks drawling ``You've got mail'' (or Porky Pig sputtering
``That's all, folks'' as the America Online signoff). Then again, a
collaboration between Madonna and the Spice Girls, now that they're
assets of the same corporation, might be somebody's just desserts.
</P>
<P>
   The new recording megacompanies shouldn't waste effort on brand
recognition. While a small label _ Rawkus or Green Linnet or Ninja
Tune _ can build insider cachet, no sane music fan thinks, ``Gosh,
I want that album because it's on Reprise Records, not Columbia.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger the company, the less it means to people who care
about a certain performer. To a consumer, all the major labels are
already interchangeable. Although they battle for radio air time
and shelf space in stores, squeezing out independent labels, the
majors are so large that, paradoxically, they seem invisible.
</P>
<P>
   The new Big Four or Big Three might as well start thinking about
making all their music jointly available. It's time to dismantle
brand-name obstacles to the inevitable change from selling music as
discrete units of plastic to delivering it as information.
</P>
<P>
   Billboard magazine estimated that the majors own three million
recordings, 85 percent of the last century's output; the entire
archive should be online in one place. If competing banks can share
worldwide ATM networks, then the Warner EMI Web site could have a
click-through to Christina Aguilera on BMG.
</P>
<P>
   The online archive shouldn't just include the current American
catalog. It can hold deleted albums from one-hit wonders, as well
as ancient stray songs that didn't make the transition from 78-rpm
disc to LP or CD.
</P>
<P>
   Once lawyers and accountants work out the copyright questions,
it should hook up to international holdings, from EMI India to
Polygram Brasil. At the same time, to forestall the genuine fears
that the majors will monopolize Internet music the way they
commandeer retail space in stores, the online archive should
provide access to independently released music. That wouldn't
eliminate the odds against small labels, but it would give a
pretense of fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Music from the archive should be available not only for purchase
as individual songs priced like the tracks of CDs _ the fading
dream of executives whose careers rest on discs trucked to retail
stores _ but as a monthly subscription like cable television
(something Time Warner understands) or Internet access (America
Online's foundation). Just as Internet service providers all sell
the same Web with different facades, conglomerates could offer
various portals and prices.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the recording business' obsession with piracy
would finally become obsolete. If homemade copies of ``The
Sopranos'' are in circulation, that doesn't seem to trouble HBO.
People buy discs, or trade MP3 files, not to accumulate goods but
to hear the music they want when they want it.
</P>
<P>
   If music were accessible on demand by subscription, only rabid
collectors would continue to accumulate it in tangible form.
Everyone else would simply listen to the music of the moment,
transfer it to disc or tape or memory stick for the car player or
the morning jog, then erase it, because it could be accessed
whenever the longing struck.
</P>
<P>
   How would those great big companies keep up their profit
margins? Subscription fees, Web site advertising, merchandise
tie-ins, reduced manufacturing costs, licensing fees for movies and
advertising and publishing revenues through copyright fees, for
starters. (Warner EMI Music would combine the top two publishing
companies, with Universal and BMG right behind them.)
</P>
<P>
   More important, musicians have to be paid; along with tour and
merchandise revenues, they could collect royalties based on how
many times their songs had been played. That would be an incentive
to make music with lasting appeal.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it's a fantasy. Fast, universal Internet access is some time
away. And even when it arrives, the big new conglomerates will
probably be squabbling over formats and clinging to the idea of
selling singles and albums instead of music access.
</P>
<P>
   (They're already suing outfits like MyMP3.-com and myplay.com,
which are individual online collections built from albums people
already own.) But while they wrangle, the new behemoths should
think about making listeners as happy as stockholders.

GOVERNOR'S CAMPAIGN SAYS IT'S READY TO MOVE ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOFFSTOWN, N.H. _ Governor George W. Bush knew he was in for a
tough fight in New Hampshire. He was mindful of his father's
struggles here. He was even prepared to lose.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Bush campaign began to learn of early exit poll
results Tuesday afternoon, facing what appeared to be the first
defeat in his national campaign, the unshakable confidence
surrounding the campaign appeared noticeably subdued.
</P>
<P>
   One adviser said Bush might need to retune his message slightly.
Another said the staff was mostly feeling ``disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   No one suggested Bush was in serious trouble nationwide. If
anything, the campaign was looking forward to the rest of the
country, eager to fly Wednesday to South Carolina to campaign among
voters who are far less independent-minded and unpredictable, in a
state that has turned out to support the Bush family for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate concern, said J. Warren Tompkins, Bush's Southeast
regional director, was to ``erase New Hampshire out of your memory
and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush will still be the Republican nominee, Tompkins said, if he
can ``come out and roll up his sleeves and be himself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some thought that it was going to be close. You want
to believe the ones (polls) that indicated it was going to be
close,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've seen it happen before. . . . Everyone who has sought
this nomination, with the exception of Jimmy Carter, has gone
through a period like this. It's a good test of your mettle. It
makes you roll up your sleeves and get to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple gusto was not enough to resuscitate the campaign of
Bush's father, George Bush, in 1980. Coming out of the Iowa
caucuses with an overwhelming victory, the elder Bush, then the
underdog, championed the ``Big Mo'' _ the momentum he hoped would
carry him through New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush lost to Reagan. His son was mindful of the loss. Just
before winning the Iowa caucuses Jan. 24, the Texas governor said:
``Big Mo didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, victory does not mean victory,'' George W. Bush
said Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the candidate spent the predawn hours visiting five
polling sites and a restaurant in and around Manchester, part of a
last-minute push for support that began at 2:30 a.m. the Tuesday
before. He spoke as confidently as he had all week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to convince people on our team to vote, and the
undecideds to come our way,'' Bush told voters at a 6:30 a.m. stop
at the Webster School in Manchester. ``And that's what I'm going to
spend the day doing.''
</P>
<P>
   At the McKelvie School in Bedford three hours later, Bush was
asked to predict his reaction if he fell short in the primary.
``I'm a patient man. I've got a disciplined campaign. I've got a
vision for the future, so I'm ready for what comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the crush of camera crews following Bush seemed to
irritate voters rather than entice them, Bush retreated to his
suite at the Residence Inn in Merrimack. He remained there with his
wife, Laura, and their twin 18-year-old daughters, Barbara and
Jenna, the rest of the afternoon. According to communications
director Karen Hughes, Bush rested, read, and exercised.
</P>
<P>
   It was there Bush learned about what appeared to be a crushing
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick W. Griffin, Bush's New Hampshire media adviser, said the
reaction was muted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in very good spirits. There's no change of plans,''
Griffin said as the early numbers rolled in. ``If I told you we
were elated, you'd probably realize I wasn't telling the truth. He
wanted to win. But he's a competitive guy. He's got this in
perspective.''

NAVAJOS HURT IN CLASH WITH BARRY GOLDWATER 
</HEADLINE>
 ATTENTION GALLUP, NEW MEXICO   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thousands of lives, millions of dollars and a century of history
are bound up in the Navajo-Hopi land dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Yet its course was set by a personal clash between two powerful
men.
</P>
<P>
   On one side was former Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald, known in
the 1970s as America's most prominent Indian leader.
</P>
<P>
   On the other was U.S. Sen. Barry Goldwater, viewed widely as an
almost iconic representative of the American West.
</P>
<P>
   Once close allies, the two Arizona Republicans clashed bitterly
during the 1972 presidential campaign, leading Goldwater to abandon
his previous neutrality in the Navajo-Hopi dispute.
</P>
<P>
   And when he jumped, Goldwater jumped to the Hopi side with all
the jut-jawed righteousness that made him a national symbol of
straight-talking conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater's decision to support the Hopis also convinced many of
his congressional colleagues _ baffled by an Indian battle in a
remote corner of Arizona _ that they should do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Navajos could have kept Goldwater on their side, they
might have stopped relocation,'' said Forrest Gerard, a former
Senate staffer who worked on the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the one individual who could have stopped that (1974
partition) legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW NATIONALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Peter MacDonald's name has lost much of its luster since he was
convicted in 1992 on federal charges of bribery and inciting a
political riot that claimed two lives. Aged and sickly, he's now an
inmate in a Texas federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1970s, MacDonald was an articulate, charismatic
leader of a new generation of Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   When Indian militants ransacked the Bureau of Indian Affairs
headquarters, MacDonald hit national TV's ``Face the Nation'' to
detail Indian frustration with federal policy.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald charged that federal officials often subordinated
Indian interests to the aims of outsiders seeking mineral wealth.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, he led the formation of what he called a
Native American OPEC, an effort to ensure that Indians got fair
value for their land's coal, oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is rightfully ours, we must protect,'' he declared.
``What is rightfully due us, we must claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Born into reservation poverty, MacDonald didn't wear shoes until
he was 5. In an attempt to make phonetic sense out of his Navajo
name, BIA teachers dubbed him ``Peter Donald.'' His classmates then
started calling him ``MacDonald'' from the schoolyard song.
</P>
<P>
   He served with the Marines in World War II, earned an
engineering degree, worked in the California defense industry and
volunteered for Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Then MacDonald applied his energy and ambition to reservation
government. In 1970, he was elected Navajo chairman.
</P>
<P>
   A spellbinding speaker in Navajo, MacDonald declared fervent
commitment to Navajo tradition, yet played golf with powerful
businessmen, drove a Lincoln Continental and patronized the most
expensive hotels in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   He hired a personal photographer, wore tailored suits and spent
thousands to turn his Window Rock office into regal quarters.
</P>
<P>
   RISING STAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, he was a prominent Indian Republican, a
valuable political commodity for a party looking to widen its
political base. So valuable, in fact, that in 1972 Goldwater
arranged for MacDonald to nominate Richard Nixon at the Republican
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship was especially gratifying for Goldwater, who
enjoyed regaling easterners with stories of ``my Indians.'' He
claimed to speak Navajo _ though he knew only a few phrases and
sometimes showed little knowledge of Navajo and Hopi lands.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Goldwater's affection for the tribes was beyond question.
He had a large kachina doll collection and once owned a trading
post on the Navajo reservation. He named his Paradise Valley house
Be-nun-i-kin, Navajo for ``house on the hill.''
</P>
<P>
   But shortly before the 1972 Republican convention, the powerful
senator and the powerful Indian leader fell out.
</P>
<P>
   CLASH OF TITANS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives had unexpectedly passed a bill to
settle the Navajo-Hopi dispute with massive relocation. Desperate
to stop it, MacDonald appealed to the Senate committee that would
hear the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Its chairman was Sen. George McGovern, Democratic candidate for
president.
</P>
<P>
   And when McGovern said he preferred negotiation to forced
relocation, a grateful MacDonald told the ``Washington Post'' that
if Republicans did not help the Navajos in the dispute, he might
``have to support George McGovern.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater was furious. Determined to punish MacDonald, he came
out firmly on the Hopi side in the land dispute.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to colleagues, Goldwater wrote that ``There is no
relocation problem,'' and that federal relocation benefits would
offer Navajos ``a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity'' to improve their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Navajos, meanwhile, formed an alliance with the AFL-CIO,
which helped turn out Navajo voters against Goldwater and other
Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   An enraged Goldwater charged that Navajos had been lured to the
polls by promises of free beer. ``They're not interested in the
White man's elections,'' he said, ``but they voted by the thousands
last month.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald lashed back. He called his antagonist ``Kit
Goldwater,'' a scalding reference to Kit Carson, who in the 1860s
rounded up the Navajos and sent them to captivity.
</P>
<P>
   CLOSE ALLY LOST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater continued to play a decisive anti-Navajo role in the
dispute until he left the Senate in 1986. He helped choose
relocation commissioners and thwarted others' efforts to enact a
land exchange that would have limited forced relocation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, two years before his death, Goldwater made a gesture of
reconciliation, asking President Clinton to end MacDonald's
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   ``May I implore upon your kindness and good judgment to grant
this man a pardon,'' Goldwater wrote, ``so he can return to his
tribe, his sacred lands and mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald remains in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Relocation continues. &QL;

<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Sen. John McCain's great gamble paid off Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The state on which he bet his all _ and logged nearly 20,000
miles in his campaign bus _ did not just give him a victory over
Texas Gov. George Bush, it gave him a landslide and sent him
roaring into South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the Republican Party has recovered its heritage of
reform,'' McCain said grinning broadly, in a balloon-bedecked hotel
ballroom, as he thanked his supporters for heeding his call to
``break the Washington Iron Triangle of big money, lobbyists and
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving a taste of how he might take on the Democrats, he said,
``This is a good thing, my friends. And it is the beginning of the
end of the truth-twisting politics of Bill Clinton and Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   He cast his campaign as an effort to ``return to a time of
conservative common sense in Washington'' and said that a ``great
national crusade has just begun.''
</P>
<P>
   But even McCain appeared stunned by the magnitude of his win
despite a year of relentless campaigning in New Hampshire. On the
eighth floor of the hotel where McCain, his family and friends were
gathered around a television in the Presidential Suite, his wife,
Cindy, put her hand to her mouth and her eyes welled up when CNN
proclaimed McCain's victory. ``It really happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said simply, ``You can't help but be amazed by the size
of this. It's across the board, came from all sectors _
conservatives, moderates, liberals, women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a win for the message,'' he said. ``The people in
Washington are going to wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   His aides were giddy and his supporters triumphant. Asked what
the results meant for Bush, Mike Murphy, McCain's senior
strategist, grinned and said one word _``iceberg'' _ to conjure up
the image of the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   As McCain's supporters watched Bush concede on television they
booed when the governor tried to dismiss New Hampshire as a state
that had ``long been known as a bump in the road for
front-runners.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain still lacks the vast resources and national organization
of Bush, who emphasized all day that he was the candidate who could
last through the long-haul. But McCain has been telling his
audiences that a decisive win here will give him a ``megaphone'' to
broadcast his message of reform Republicanism to voters across the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The next major test comes in South Carolina, which holds the
first of the southern primaries, on Feb. 19, and which has
traditionally restored battered establishment front-runners instead
of promoting mavericks. McCain has been gaining ground there but
still lags far behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain said he expected his victory to awaken voters in
South Carolina. ``South Carolina doesn't sit out in the ocean by
itself,'' he said recently. ``South Carolina is impacted by the
national media, the same way every other state is.''
</P>
<P>
   Not wasting a moment, he pulled out of New Hampshire quickly
Tuesday night and headed toward his next must-win state where
supporters were holding a post midnight rally at the
Greenville/Spartanburg airport.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, both McCain's methods and his message were
unorthodox. With limited money, he decided to skip the Iowa
caucuses and focus entirely on the first primary state, New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   He spent 71 days in the state, held 114 of his free-wheeling
unscripted town hall meetings and put nearly 20,000 miles on his
bus, emblazoned with the motto ``Straight Talk Express,'' which
became a kind of moving press conference and political salon.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign themes, too, broke with party dogma. As Republican
leaders in Washington insisted that unrestrained campaign spending
was free speech, McCain put the overhaul of the campaign finance
system at the very heart of his candidacy. And instead of endorsing
large tax cuts, he put forward a plan for moderate tax cuts that
would devote billions of dollars from the federal surplus to Social
Security and paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's gripping personal story as a prisoner of war also added
to his appeal. He spent time Tuesday afternoon in his suite with
four of the men who had been held and tortured with him in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the former POWs even took their turn at warming up
the ballroom crowd. ``How could one on the road to coronation
possibly lose?'' asked one, Orson Swindle, mocking Bush. ``It was
inevitable right?'' As the throngs cheered, ``Go, John, Go,''
Swindle said, ``We've got the man. We've got the man.''

NAVAJOS HURT IN CLASH WITH BARRY GOLDWATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 ATTENTION GALLUP, NEW MEXICO 
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thousands of lives, millions of dollars and a century of history
are bound up in the Navajo-Hopi land dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Yet its course was set by a personal clash between two powerful
men.
</P>
<P>
   On one side was former Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald, known in
the 1970s as America's most prominent Indian leader.
</P>
<P>
   On the other was U.S. Sen. Barry Goldwater, viewed widely as an
almost iconic representative of the American West.
</P>
<P>
   Once close allies, the two Arizona Republicans clashed bitterly
during the 1972 presidential campaign, leading Goldwater to abandon
his previous neutrality in the Navajo-Hopi dispute.
</P>
<P>
   And when he jumped, Goldwater jumped to the Hopi side with all
the jut-jawed righteousness that made him a national symbol of
straight-talking conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater's decision to support the Hopis also convinced many of
his congressional colleagues _ baffled by an Indian battle in a
remote corner of Arizona _ that they should do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Navajos could have kept Goldwater on their side, they
might have stopped relocation,'' said Forrest Gerard, a former
Senate staffer who worked on the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the one individual who could have stopped that (1974
partition) legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW NATIONALISM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Peter MacDonald's name has lost much of its luster since he was
convicted in 1992 on federal charges of bribery and inciting a
political riot that claimed two lives. Aged and sickly, he's now an
inmate in a Texas federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1970s, MacDonald was an articulate, charismatic
leader of a new generation of Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   When Indian militants ransacked the Bureau of Indian Affairs
headquarters, MacDonald hit national TV's ``Face the Nation'' to
detail Indian frustration with federal policy.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald charged that federal officials often subordinated
Indian interests to the aims of outsiders seeking mineral wealth.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, he led the formation of what he called a
Native American OPEC, an effort to ensure that Indians got fair
value for their land's coal, oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is rightfully ours, we must protect,'' he declared.
``What is rightfully due us, we must claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Born into reservation poverty, MacDonald didn't wear shoes until
he was 5. In an attempt to make phonetic sense out of his Navajo
name, BIA teachers dubbed him ``Peter Donald.'' His classmates then
started calling him ``MacDonald'' from the schoolyard song.
</P>
<P>
   He served with the Marines in World War II, earned an
engineering degree, worked in the California defense industry and
volunteered for Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Then MacDonald applied his energy and ambition to reservation
government. In 1970, he was elected Navajo chairman.
</P>
<P>
   A spellbinding speaker in Navajo, MacDonald declared fervent
commitment to Navajo tradition, yet played golf with powerful
businessmen, drove a Lincoln Continental and patronized the most
expensive hotels in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   He hired a personal photographer, wore tailored suits and spent
thousands to turn his Window Rock office into regal quarters.
</P>
<P>
   RISING STAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, he was a prominent Indian Republican, a
valuable political commodity for a party looking to widen its
political base. So valuable, in fact, that in 1972 Goldwater
arranged for MacDonald to nominate Richard Nixon at the Republican
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship was especially gratifying for Goldwater, who
enjoyed regaling easterners with stories of ``my Indians.'' He
claimed to speak Navajo _ though he knew only a few phrases and
sometimes showed little knowledge of Navajo and Hopi lands.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Goldwater's affection for the tribes was beyond question.
He had a large kachina doll collection and once owned a trading
post on the Navajo reservation. He named his Paradise Valley house
Be-nun-i-kin, Navajo for ``house on the hill.''
</P>
<P>
   But shortly before the 1972 Republican convention, the powerful
senator and the powerful Indian leader fell out.
</P>
<P>
   CLASH OF TITANS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives had unexpectedly passed a bill to
settle the Navajo-Hopi dispute with massive relocation. Desperate
to stop it, MacDonald appealed to the Senate committee that would
hear the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Its chairman was Sen. George McGovern, Democratic candidate for
president.
</P>
<P>
   And when McGovern said he preferred negotiation to forced
relocation, a grateful MacDonald told the ``Washington Post'' that
if Republicans did not help the Navajos in the dispute, he might
``have to support George McGovern.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater was furious. Determined to punish MacDonald, he came
out firmly on the Hopi side in the land dispute.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to colleagues, Goldwater wrote that ``There is no
relocation problem,'' and that federal relocation benefits would
offer Navajos ``a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity'' to improve their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Navajos, meanwhile, formed an alliance with the AFL-CIO,
which helped turn out Navajo voters against Goldwater and other
Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   An enraged Goldwater charged that Navajos had been lured to the
polls by promises of free beer. ``They're not interested in the
White man's elections,'' he said, ``but they voted by the thousands
last month.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald lashed back. He called his antagonist ``Kit
Goldwater,'' a scalding reference to Kit Carson, who in the 1860s
rounded up the Navajos and sent them to captivity.
</P>
<P>
   CLOSE ALLY LOST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater continued to play a decisive anti-Navajo role in the
dispute until he left the Senate in 1986. He helped choose
relocation commissioners and thwarted others' efforts to enact a
land exchange that would have limited forced relocation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, two years before his death, Goldwater made a gesture of
reconciliation, asking President Clinton to end MacDonald's
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   ``May I implore upon your kindness and good judgment to grant
this man a pardon,'' Goldwater wrote, ``so he can return to his
tribe, his sacred lands and mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald remains in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Relocation continues. &QL;

FOR GORE, NO LETUP IN ASKING FOR VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ With the sky dark and just an hour to go
before the polls closed Tuesday, Al Gore was out at the polling
stations, shaking hands and making a last-minute plea for support.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, the Gore campaign insisted, was not taking
anything for granted _ not a single vote. And by the time the
campaign was over, a single-vote victory would have pleased the
candidate who saw his support in opinion polls seesaw from far
behind in September, to comfortably leading in the week before the
contest, to a nail-bitingly close race on primary day.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a hard-fought race like this, a win is a win,'' said
Doug Hattaway, Gore's New Hampshire campaign spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The fight between Gore and his rival Bill Bradley had taken a
nasty turn in the last, anxious days of the New Hampshire campaign,
and Gore had not been shy of accusing Bradley of everything from
negativism to promoting a bad plan for health care.
</P>
<P>
   But with the task at hand _ getting out the Gore vote _ too
critical for Gore to be distracted by a little political
cross-punching, the vice president summed up the New Hampshire
campaign with a new diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a good discussion,'' Gore said as he exited a
Dunkin' Donuts here, carrying coffee for poll workers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had not been scheduled to visit voters late in the day; his
original plan was to go to some polling stations in the morning
until the afternoon, then head to his hotel to get ready for the
election results with his wife, Tipper, and two of his daughters.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign had been hard at work, hanging 30,000 notes on the
doors of undecided voters, and making 160,000 calls to Democrats
and independents.
</P>
<P>
   But as dusk fell, the Gore campaign was not taking any chances,
and the candidate set out again to the streets of southern New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike at his campaign rallies, where the crowd seemed packed
with Gore supporters, the vice president faced a fired-up and
extremely vocal electorate as he struggled to shake hands at
polling stations.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley backers as well as supporters for Republican and
third-party candidates waved signs and screamed their candidates'
names, trying to out-shout the cheers of Gore supporters who mobbed
their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The costumed crowd was out in full force _ from the people in
fluffy pig costumes carrying ``Tax Meat'' signs to people like Luke
Martin, who wore a long rubber tube on the end of his nose in
reference to Pinocchio and accused Gore of lying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that there's much of a difference in what they have
to say,'' said Martin, 29, of Gore and Bradley. ``It's about
honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Bradley because he's the noninsider insider,'' said Liz
Reynolds of Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's vote was a contest the Gore staff had hoped would make
Bradley go away _ if not immediately, then after the New York,
California, and Southern primaries next month.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore's staff appears confident the vice president will
ultimately win the Democratic nomination, the workers want the path
to be clearer and less expensive than Bradley's presence has made
it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bradley, the Gore campaign staff acknowledges, was one of
the best things that could happen to Gore as a candidate. Without
the kick-in-the-behind strong showing by Bradley in public opinion
polls in the fall, Gore might not have revamped his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, whose soft, Southern elocution and endless chat about the
budget surplus tends to make him sounds like he's giving a
commencement address to accountants, got fired up and
uncharacteristically emotional in the last couple of weeks.

BRADLEY DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE `JOYOUS JOURNEY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Millions of Bill Bradley's campaign dollars
are gone. More than a year of his time has been exhausted as he
stumped from living rooms in rural Iowa to factory gates in New
Hampshire mill towns. And he has found himself searching for ways
to prevent incidents of erratic heartbeat that have plagued him
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bradley has just begun the campaign he describes as ``a
joyous journey.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, the preliminary rounds ended. Win or lose, Bill
Bradley has said from the start, Iowa and New Hampshire were
waystations on the road to the ``national primary,'' the 15-state
prizefight on March 7 on which he has bet his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his drubbing in Iowa and the outcome in New Hampshire,
Bradley and his aides Tuesday night said they never expected to
knock out Al Gore, a sitting vice president, in the first two
contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole new day,'' Bradley's spokesman, Eric Hauser, said
before the last polls closed Tuesday. `` &UR; Tomorrow &LR;  begins the
national primary.''
</P>
<P>
   With $20 million in the bank, an enduring belief in his ``new
politics'' of bold ideas and integrity, and growing acrimony toward
Gore, Bradley is about to wager that he can build enough momentum
to surge past Gore by the middle of March.
</P>
<P>
   If he cannot catch him by then, Bradley has acknowledged, his
candidacy is ``toast.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley believes the nation has yet to focus on the
election, that the fireworks of Iowa and New Hampshire have not
flickered beyond the borders of those states. And he is hoping that
his money, if not his momentum, can change the odds despite Gore's
lock on the Democratic establishment from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   Before the votes were counted Tuesday night, Bradley sought an
edge by challenging Gore to one debate a week until March 7. He
issued the challenge in part because his fortunes have risen since
his last debate with Gore, in Manchster last week, when he abruptly
abandoned his gentlemanly tone and ripped into Gore's integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's poll numbers climbed for several days after the
debate, as he kept up his attack on Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the votes were tallied Tuesday night in New
Hampshire, Bradley was scheduled to set off on a frenetic,
three-day sweep through nearly half the March 7 primary states,
including two top prizes: New York and California. He was scheduled
to hit Connecticut and New York Wednesday , then fly to San
Francisco for an event Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   He is off to Maryland and Florida on Friday, and he has stops
planned in New York Sunday, Ohio and Missouri Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bradley tried to demonstrate that his national
organization has some grass-roots heft by publicizing a series of
``victory parties'' his supporters were holding Tuesday night
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spent much of the day at the door of polling stations in
southern New Hampshire, shaking hands, patting voters on the
shoulder, asking for their support. He focused his efforts on the
three largest polling stations in the state, in Merrimack, Hampton,
and Portsmouth.
</P>
<P>
   In Merrimack, Bradley shared the sidewalk with a Republican
contender, Gary Bauer. The two struck a conciliatory tone as
Bradley gave Bauer a cough drop and accepted a handwarmer in
return.
</P>
<P>
   In a last-minute effort to diminish concerns about his heart
condition, Bradley also dispatched his cardiologist, J. Thomas
Biggers, to CBS's ``Early Show'' to report that Bradley's health is
``outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggers said Bradley ``has no heart disease and has no risk of
heart disease.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more a political issue than a health issue,'' Biggers
said.

<P>
   Dick Vermeil, who popularized the phrase ``coaching burnout''
when he resigned suddenly in 1983, but returned to the sideline 14
years later, did something even more unexpected Tuesday. He quit as
coach of the St. Louis Rams less than 48 hours after winning Super
Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   His voice cracking, he halted his off-the-cuff talk several
times to keep from breaking into tears, but the 63-year-old Vermeil
had a simple explanation for leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be the head coach next year and say, `I should
have retired when I was on top,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He will be replaced by the Rams' offensive coordinator, Mike
Martz, a 46-year-old summa cum laude graduate of Fresno State who
had already been designated to succeed Vermeil whenever he left the
Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil had spoken of returning to fulfill the final two years
of his five-year contract after the Rams had defeated the Tennessee
Titans by 23-16 in Atlanta. Instead, he said, he had a 20-minute
talk Monday night with his wife of 42 years, Carolyn, another
20-minute discussion Tuesday morning and decided to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few people in this profession get the chance to retire on
top,'' he said Tuesday at the Rams' headquarters. But he pointed
out that the San Francisco 49ers continued to have success after
Bill Walsh retired in 1989, and he described the Rams' coaching
staff as ``in very good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   He also spoke of having 11 grandchildren _ ``two of them don't
even know me; they were born the last three years.''
</P>
<P>
   These three years have turned into one of the best second acts
in American sports history.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil was a driven, obsessive 39-year-old when he took over
the Philadelphia Eagles in 1976. He led them to the Super Bowl
following the 1980 season, but lost to the Raiders, the
buccaneering bunch that was in stark contrast to the tightly reined
Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Only two years after that Super Bowl appearance, Vermeil, then
46, stepped down. He called himself a victim of coaching burnout,
characterized by too many missed meals, too many nights spent
sleeping in his office, too much time worrying why the X's and O's
were not always in the exact spot on the field they had been in his
diagrams.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 16 years he was an analyst for ABC and CBS.
Routinely, he turned down coaching offers, but he still enjoyed the
details. When the 2-point conversion was adopted by the National
Football League, Vermeil drew up a chart listing every imaginable
scenario in which a coach could opt for the 2-point play instead of
the 1-point kick. It was distributed to teams around the league.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997 the Rams, one of those perennially troubled teams
still without an identity in St. Louis, which it had adopted after
leaving Los Angles, got Vermeil to return.
</P>
<P>
   Before training camp was far along, there was a player revolt
over his nonstop drills, twice a day every day. This was a
different Vermeil, though, and he listened to his players and
allowed them to cut back.
</P>
<P>
   The team was bad, though, with a 5-11 record that was followed
by a 4-12 mark in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Vermeil was seen as a man past his time and even
became an object of derision. In some quarters, his return to
coaching, along with that of Mike Ditka to the New Orleans Saints,
was seen as a continuation of the league's good-old-boy policy that
kept younger coaches and minorities from getting to the top post.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it all worked for Vermeil this season. He parlayed his
unknown former Arena League quarterback, Kurt Warner, and a solidly
drilled band of players into the league's most surprising team.
</P>
<P>
   With the Rams' victory Sunday night, Vermeil became the oldest
coach ever to capture a Super Bowl title.
</P>
<P>
   In leaving, he became the fifth to depart his team after winning
the Super Bowl. Vince Lombardi of the Green Bay Packers was the
first, in 1968, followed by Walsh, then Bill Parcells of the New
York Giants (1991) and the Dallas Cowboys' Jimmy Johnson (1994).
</P>
<P>
   Although he is one of only four coaches to have led two
different teams to Super Bowl appearances, he posted an overall
record of 66-74 over 13 seasons.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   New Hampshire's voice commands attention for one reason above
all others: The state speaks well because it listens well.
</P>
<P>
   In a long campaign that lacked focus until  &UR; last night &LR; , the
people of New Hampshire patiently answered their phones (90 percent
received a call from at least one campaign), opened their mail (90
percent received flyers), and trudged out to cookouts, house
parties, and town meetings (25 percent personally met at least one
candidate).
</P>
<P>
   After weighing what they had heard, they went out  &UR; yesterday &LR; 
and gave the nation a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Every four years, attempts are made to push the New Hampshire
primary off its first-in-the-nation perch. The state is not
demographically representative. It would be fairer to move the
honor around. But the crucial point is that these people know what
they're doing. They know how to question and make judgments about
the candidates individually, while not being overly impressed with
big spending or establishment backing.
</P>
<P>
   This year, independent voters outnumbered registered Republicans
for the first time, with Democrats running third. And they made
themselves heard. While Senator John McCain beat Governor George W.
Bush among Republicans, according to exit polls, his big margin _
and former Senator Bill Bradley's surprising strength against Vice
President Al Gore _ were due to independents, many of them young
voters.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest winner  &UR; yesterday &LR;  was the New Hampshire primary
itself, which proved once again that it performs well as the
nation's ear.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the candidates who did less well than they had hoped feel
no great affection for the New Hampshire primary this morning, but
they should not try to change it. Situations differ from year to
year. Governor Bush's father lost a crippling New Hampshire primary
to Ronald Reagan in 1980, but then beat Bob Dole there equally
decisively in the 1988 primary.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire deserves to be first.

RULES THAT SIDELINED ATHLETES AS FRESHMEN ARE REPEALED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Alaska)   (bl)  
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Collegiate Athletic Association has redefined what
constitutes an acceptable high school course for incoming college
athletes, ending more than four years of battle with parents and
school officials who had complained that the course parameters were
arbitrary and often irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the regulations delayed or canceled the athletic
scholarships of hundreds of good students each year, including
national merit scholars and others with near-perfect
grade-point-averages.
</P>
<P>
   The rules were intended to raise the quality of the athletes'
transcripts, but the association, in several votes taken without
fanfare last month, acknowledged that it had been out of step with
a broad spectrum of less-conventional yet rigorous courses now
offered by many public high schools, as well as by charter schools,
community colleges and even schools on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   One old regulation disqualified social studies courses devoting
more than 25 percent of classroom time to current events or
independent study.
</P>
<P>
   The onus for proving that courses are worthy will now lie with
principals and guidance counselors, underscoring the difficulty
that the association had encountered in positioning itself as an
arbiter of academic excellence. The association said it was
confident that high school officials would insure the integrity of
the transcripts of their student athletes by honestly assessing the
courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard what the high schools were saying,'' said Bob Oliver,
the director of membership services for the association. ``We all
feel comfortable that this does not compromise the intent of the
initial eligibility requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes will affect students applying to attend college and
play competitive sports as soon as next fall. But the repeal of the
rules, some of which date from 1986, comes too late for hundreds
who were forced to sit on the sidelines during their freshman year
in seasons past, pending their first-year grades.
</P>
<P>
   The association estimates that of the 80,000 students who apply
to play college sports each year, it delayed or canceled the play
of 2,800 to 8,400 students each year, using the guidelines.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of the student-athletes disqualified was Ryan Scott, 19, of
Wisconsin, who was accepted last spring for admission to the
University of Alaska on a full hockey scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who graduated from high school with a B-plus average, was
informed a week after arriving in Anchorage last August that he had
been disqualified from playing hockey his freshman year _ and that
his scholarship was therefore being revoked _ because the
association would not accept the English course he took in the
second half of his senior year, according to his mother, Kathy
Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Though all of the English courses he had taken until that point
had been traditional college preparatory ones, his mother said, he
had taken ``broadcast communications'' _ a writing and speaking
course that his school considers college-prep English _ during his
senior spring, so that he might get a jump on preparing for his
planned career as a television meteorologist.
</P>
<P>
   And so, unable to afford his tuition, Scott returned home to
Wisconsin, and instead of playing Division 1 hockey at Anchorage,
he is playing Division 3 hockey (Division 3 schools were always
exempt from the rules) at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens
Point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like he won the lottery one day,'' his mother said,
``and someone took it away from him the next.''
</P>
<P>
   The rule change may have come just in time, though, for another
student-athlete, Michael Ogrydziak. Ogrydziak, 17, a National Merit
semifinalist who scored 1,470 out of a possible 1,600 on the
college board entrance exam, was informed by the association last
fall that he would not be eligible to play tennis at any Division 1
school.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: students at his school are educated almost
exclusively at home. The new rules defer to high schools to
determine what is college-preparatory work, but prospective
student-athletes applying to Division 1 universities must still
take four years of English; two years of mathematics; two years of
science; two years of social science; one additional year of
English, math or science, and two additional years of any of those
courses or a foreign language.

SPORTS COLUMN: CAUTION IS IMPORTANT GAME PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a few days before Super Bowl XXXIV, and security
officials from the National Football League were worried about
another incident in which one of its players would get caught with
his pants down, maybe literally, the week of the big game. So they
lectured players from the two teams about staying out of trouble.
The players were told to avoid strip clubs, to not drive drunk and
to scalp game tickets at their own risk.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Atlanta was swarming with undercover police
officers, springing traps of all sorts everywhere, and the NFL was
afraid of another Eugene Robinson incident. Robinson, an Atlanta
Falcons defender, was arrested last year in Miami the night before
the Super Bowl while soliciting an undercover officer posing as a
prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Players from the St. Louis Rams and the Tennessee Titans
listened closely and, citing what some players were calling the
``Eugene Robinson rallying cry,'' most spent much of their time
inside the team hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Lewis, a Baltimore Ravens linebacker, did not hear any of
the NFL's warnings. It's too bad. Lewis, who was arrested early
Monday and charged with two counts of murder, might have benefited
from the words of the security men, especially those that warned
the players to always be careful of whom they hang out with and
where.
</P>
<P>
   An NFL team official said that Lewis went to the Cobalt bar in
Atlanta with a group of friends, some of whom, the official said,
were ``extremely questionable characters.'' The official also said
the Ravens have been concerned for some time that Lewis was running
with a rough crowd and had planned to discuss that with him as soon
as possible, advising him to be more intelligent in choosing his
friends.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of those friends, the official said, was currently
in a gang, or had been in one.
</P>
<P>
   There were other NFL players partying at the Cobalt, at various
points of the evening, but it is Lewis who will be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Two men were stabbed to death during a fight that broke out near
the club after a party there that lasted well into Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta police have charged Lewis with the murders, making
him the third active player in professional football history to be
so accused. This is not the kind of list anyone wants to make.
Lewis joins the Panthers' Rae Carruth, who is charged with
orchestrating the drive-by shooting of his pregnant girlfriend late
last year, and the former Pittsburgh Steelers running back Jerry
Nuzum, who in 1951 was arrested for murdering a waitress in Las
Cruces, N.M. The Nuzum case went to trial, but it was dismissed by
a judge for lack of evidence only days before going to jury.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, in custody in an Atlanta jail, strongly maintains his
innocence. His lawyer, Max Richardson Jr., said that although Lewis
was at the scene, he had nothing to do with the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking the position that he was in the wrong place at
the wrong time,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the point. Despite an encyclopedia full of examples,
some players continue to naively believe that when they go to a
club, they are not targets. They are, however, as large as the
Eiffel Tower. Then there are the players who make other people the
targets. They think they can do whatever they want, from attacking
a woman who spurned an advance, to beating up a patron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go out; I have fun, but I mostly go to dinner with friends
and things like that,'' the Rams' Kevin Carter said. ``If I do go
to a night club, I'm very careful about where I go.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked why, the 6-foot-5-inch, 300-pound Carter said: ``When
a big guy like me walks into a rowdy bar, there is always some jerk
who will want to take me on. I may get pushed by somebody for just
standing there, and if I fight back, I'm the one who ends up in
trouble and in the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Agnew, a defensive lineman for the Rams, said: ``I only go
to places I know are cool. If I sense trouble, I get the heck
out.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases athletes have become so rich that a part of them
believes their wealth has made them invulnerable. Lewis had
recently signed a contract extension worth $26 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the guys in football I know are very responsible
people, good people,'' Agnew said. ``There are a few guys, though,
who do believe they can buy their way out of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis may be completely innocent of the charges. Perhaps, as his
lawyer contended, he was nothing but a bystander caught up in
events that spun out of control. Surely, Lewis now wishes he had
heeded the warnings of those NFL security officials.
</P>
<P>
   The only hope is that other players will look at what has
happened to Lewis _ and learn.  &QL;

LOCAL MEDIA PROVIDE LAST-MINUTE FORUM

<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ With little hope of victory here, publisher Steve
Forbes sought at least a solid third-place showing by packing in
more than a dozen radio and television interviews in the final
hours of the New Hampshire primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But when a traveling ``mosh pit'' presented itself, the
straight-laced conservative deftly dodged an unwanted
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   A strategy of working local media helped Forbes in last week's
Iowa caucuses, where Forbes finished a strong second behind Texas
Governor George W. Bush. But Forbes never enjoyed a hoped-for boost
in polls here and has been trying to inject himself into a
Republican debate dominated by Bush and Senator John McCain of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes hit the airwaves at dawn Tuesday, telling thousands of
morning talk radio listeners that he is ``an independent outsider''
determined to abolish the Internal Revenue Service, institute a 17
percent flat tax, and outlaw abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Such appearances are invaluable to a candidate who feels
unfairly ignored by the national media, despite having spent more
than $28 million of his own fortune on a long-shot presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were few indications Tuesday that Forbes would
finish strong here, his aides said a McCain victory would leave
Bush weakened and push conservative voters toward Forbes, not the
more moderate Arizonan.
</P>
<P>
   But while his radio strategy allows Forbes to speak directly to
an audience of likely voters, Tuesday it was not without its
perils.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who has never held elective office, was preceded on a
Boston FM radio station by the Jimi Hendrix song, ``Are You
Experienced?'' And sure enough, WAAF radio host Greg Hill pressed
Forbes on his qualifications. Forbes says his background as
businessman, not a ``Washington insider,'' is a plus.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after Forbes signed off, Hill speculated on-air whether
his guest might be a space alien. ``It's like the movie `Men In
Black,' '' Hill said. ``There's someone pulling the strings,
telling him what to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Things were even less dignified later outside the studios of
Manchester station WGIR, when Forbes encountered filmmaker Michael
Moore and Moore's traveling band of 20-something punk-rockers.
</P>
<P>
   Moore and his followers, who are filming a new cable television
program, recently persuaded GOP candidate Alan Keyes to dive into
their slam-dancing mosh pit. That prompted conservative activist
Gary Bauer to scold Keyes during a televised debate last week,
saying the stunt was in bad taste.
</P>
<P>
   Moore ambushed Forbes in the WGIR studio as his group of
followers set up a small dance area in the parking lot and jumped
around to songs by the band Rage Against the Machine, whose
politically charged music had so infuriated Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Teasing Forbes about his vast wealth, Moore offered to endorse
him if he joined the dancing. ``If you get into the pit, I'll hold
your wallet for you,'' said Moore, director of the documentary film
``Roger and Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore explained he had withdrawn his prior endorsement of Keyes
after learning that, in drawing an analogy to abortion, he had
asked a group of fifth-graders ``what they would do if he lost his
mind and bashed their heads into a wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes demurred, then ducked out a side door without
encountering the crowd. Later, Forbes made light of the odd scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Moore doesn't keep his word, I was shocked to hear,''
Forbes said with a smile. ``He's like those politicians. He makes a
pledge and then doesn't keep it.''

BAUER, KEYES UNBOWED AS THEY CAST EYES SOUTH

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes are not giving up.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns failed to show any hidden groundswell of support
for a Bauer campaign that often failed to register a single digit
in the polls. Nonetheless, he plans to carry his conservative
crusade against abortion and moral decay at least as far as
Delaware next Tuesday and perhaps on to South Carolina Feb. 19,
said his communications director Tim Goeglein.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, a domestic policy adviser in the Reagan White House,
spent the early part of primary day visiting polling places before
taking ``downtime'' at his Nashua hotel to prepare for Tuesday
night's campaign party at an Italian restaurant in Manchester.
There, he was expected to announce that he was rethinking, but not
relinquishing, his frugal campaign to restore American values,
Goeglein said.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Testerman, a 55-year-old engineer from Mount Vernon, N.H.,
was one of about 30 people waiting for Bauer to appear at his final
rally. If Bauer drops out, Testerman said, he would not switch his
support to conservative Steve Forbes or Keyes but ``stand back and
wait'' to see who becomes the Republican nominee. He did not seem
comfortable with the antiabortion stand of any of the leading
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't bode well for Keyes, who has said that if
conservatives vote their conscience, they'll vote for him. Even as
he faced the Fox News television cameras in Manchester, though,
Keyes's press secretary frantically worked a cell phone, setting up
events in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes's New Hampshire supporters gathered Tuesday night at an
arts center in Concord for one last look at their candidate before
he headed south. Balloons were filled, bunting hung, television
cameras dutifully assembled.
</P>
<P>
   Nona Davis, a Keyes supporter from Concord, said she believes in
Keyes's message of morality. ``I'm so tired of what we've had the
last four years,'' Davis said. And however her candidate finishes
in New Hampshire, she said, ``He's already influenced the campaign
a whole bunch, and influenced the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It was reported Tuesday that Keyes was six months overdue in
filing his personal financial disclosure forms with the Federal
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully I'll get home to fill out those forms at some
point,'' Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
   But first, he'll go to South Carolina _ where he says his
grass-roots campaign has been building for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been working in South Carolina for about a year,
putting things together,'' Keyes said. ``So no break, no time to go
home.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bauer's campaign prepared to move from New Hampshire to
states where political war is waged less on foot and more by
bombardment of the airwaves, the candidate acknowledged that
continuing could be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to raise $25,000 per day, seven days per week,'' Bauer
said. ``I am not a defeatist kind of guy. I'm a fighter. We've
outlasted some big names, Elizabeth Dole, Dan Quayle, Lamarr
Alexander. To get down to five guys left and one of them is the son
of a janitor is just incredible,'' he said.

CHIEF OF INTELLIGENCE DEFENDS ROLE IN INQUIRY OF EX-DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The director of central intelligence, George J.
Tenet, said Tuesday that he had taken ``decisive action'' last year
after receiving the results of an investigation by the CIA's
inspector general into evidence that a former agency director, John
M. Deutch, had mishandled classified documents.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet suspended Deutch's security clearances indefinitely last
August, after receiving the results of the inspector general's
investigation. In a statement Tuesday, responding to an article in
The New York Times about the inspector general's report, Tenet also
denied that senior CIA officials had impeded an internal
investigation into evidence that Deutch had placed classified
documents on unclassified computers in his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that a complete investigation was done,
decisive action was taken and steps have been implemented to
improve our security process,'' Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the conclusion of the IG's investigation last August, I
made the tough decision to suspend the security clearances of my
former boss and predecessor. Copies of the IG report were provided
to our congressional oversight committees at that time. The IG
report did not conclude that anyone intentionally impeded the
investigation. Had the IG any information to that effect, he would
have had an obligation to refer the matter to the Justice
Department. He did not do so.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the inspector general's report, which remains
classified, senior CIA officials took actions that had the effect
of delaying an initial investigation into evidence that Deutch had
placed classified material on unclassified computers, potential
violations of CIA rules and U.S. law. After the material was found
on Deutch's computers as he was leaving the CIA in December 1996,
the report says officials failed to notify the Justice Department
immediately that he may have broken the law.
</P>
<P>
   The report also says the application of the independent counsel
statute was not adequately considered by CIA officials handling the
Deutch case. It adds that ``given their failure to report to the
Department of Justice on a timely basis, this in effect avoided the
potential application of the independent counsel statute.''
</P>
<P>
   The Deutch case was finally referred to the Justice Department
in 1998 by the CIA inspector general's office, more than a year
after CIA security officials first discovered that Deutch had
placed classified material on an unclassified computer in his home.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999 Attorney General Janet Reno decided not to
prosecute Deutch, according to the inspector general's report.
</P>
<P>
   A special panel has now been created inside the CIA to review
the actions of officials involved in the Deutch case, officials
said. The panel was established by Tenet on the recommendation of
the CIA's inspector general.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The former CIA executive director Nora Slatkin and the former
CIA general counsel Michael O'Neill, both of whom left the agency
in 1997, are cited in the report for taking actions that ``had the
effect of delaying a prompt and thorough investigation of this
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenet, who was Deutch's deputy and then acting CIA director
before being named director of the agency in 1997, is also cited in
the inspector general's report, which found that he had not acted
aggressively enough at first to make sure the Deutch matter was
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   After Tenet suspended his security clearances last August,
Deutch issued a statement expressing regret for his actions. He
said that he never considered the information on his home computers
to be at risk, but said he respected Tenet's decision to act.

 &HT;    ANALYSIS: Bush still confident
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    and Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOFFSTOWN, N.H. _ Gov. George W. Bush, blessed and branded with
the front-runner's tag long before he got in the presidential race,
has flamed out in his first battle with Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   To the Bush campaign, tail temporarily between its legs but
still supremely confident of ultimate victory, nothing could be
finer than to head to South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Though polls indicated McCain was headed for victory in New
Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary, there was little to
foreshadow Tuesday's final, huge margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire has long been known as a bump in the road for
front-runners, and this year is no exception,'' Bush told
supporters Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's own front-runner status on the
Democratic side also hit a bump, albeit smaller, as he survived a
strong challenge from former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the glee in the victor's camp, New Hampshire gets
chalked up as merely a victory in McCain's week-to-week survival
contest. The spotlight now shines on South Carolina's Feb. 19
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who sees the nomination battle as a marathon, today heads
there off stride. The most recent polls show him a heavy favorite
in South Carolina, but the Tuesday outcome makes a big victory
critical, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it puts pressure on Bush to do just as well (as McCain
did in New Hampshire) or better here,'' said Blease Graham, a
longtime political scientist at the University of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Tuesday's results reshaped the race, Bush already
was talking about his long-term strategy. While McCain has targeted
New Hampshire, South Carolina, Arizona and Michigan (the latter two
with primaries on Feb. 22) as the places he'll make his insurgent
stand, Bush is competing everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hats off to Senator McCain,'' said Karl Rove, Bush's top
strategist, ``but this is a national campaign of 50 states, and
we're prepared to battle in every one of them and win in every one
of them. And you can't say the same for the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain skipped last week's Iowa caucuses, won by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain _ trailing Bush $69 million to $14 million in fund
raising _ makes it through February, he then faces the daunting
task of March 7 contests in 12 states, including expensive races in
New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, Bush is counting on South Carolina to
continue its history as a political rehab center for GOP
front-runners looking to make sure losing does not become a habit.
Clemson University political science professor David Woodard said
South Carolina voters have a history of propping up sagging
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '88, they picked (the elder George) Bush and ended (Bob)
Dole's chances,'' he said of South Carolina Republicans. ``In '96,
they picked Dole and ended everyone else's chances, and both of
those candidates had come in wounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls conducted in New Hampshire by Voter News Service
showed McCain was virtually the top choice among GOP voters
regardless of what issue was most important to the voter. McCain
ran second only among the 15 percent who cited taxes as their top
issue. Forbes was first in that group, followed by Bush, who
campaigned heavily on a tax-cut plan larger than McCain's.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also got the vote from three in five independents, who
were allowed to vote in either primary, and made up one-third of
those voting Republican. Only one in five went for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   And in a statistic the Bush campaign cites as a harbinger of
better things to come, McCain's strongest showing was among
Republicans who identified themselves as liberals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a message that appealed to the moderate and liberal
independents,'' said Rove, who insists the Bush message won't
change. Other Bush aides, however, said the campaign will play up
the fact that 35 of McCain's GOP colleagues in the U.S. Senate have
endorsed Bush _ a repudiation, they say, by those who work closest
with the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had the big-name endorsements, Bush was never a good
match for the voters in a state with a reputation for contrariness.
He showed up late _ skipping a debate last November in favor of
watching wife Laura receive an alumni honor from Southern Methodist
University _ and encountered less-than-enthusiastic audiences.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush was trying to pump excitement into his campaign _
including bringing mom and dad in _ McCain was connecting with
voters. He did 114 town-hall meetings heavy on q-and-a.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to our 115th town hall meeting,'' McCain joked when he
addressed supporters after his big win.
</P>
<P>
   McCain spent more time here, but Bush spent more money on ads _
$3.2 million to McCain's $2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   At Dartmouth College, political scientist Linda Fowler said
Bush's much-ballyhooed one-on-one political skills never showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has basically been saying, `Make me your president because
I've been a good governor of Texas.''' she said. ``Well Texas isn't
New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, McCain scored by being ``authentic,'' she
said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ How little does it take? How much can it bear? Guy
Livingston played 36 one-minute piano pieces at the Miller Theater
not long ago. A few days later, the young Arnold Schoenberg's
``Gurrelieder'' rattled through Carnegie Hall, pushing the envelope
of size and length as it went.
</P>
<P>
   Admirers of Schoenberg's orchestral song cycle (and I am a wary
one) will tell you that that envelope was stuffed full of messages;
anything smaller could not have held them all. Lovers of the fast
and fleeting (and Anton Webern is their patron saint) would have
turned up their noses; not much is enough for them.
</P>
<P>
   I went to Livingston's recital hoping for revelation. Could the
tiny gesture yield the big statement? Not here, I am afraid. Most
of these pieces, despite the performer's protestations, took their
mission as a joke. Some were amusing, and the few with furrowed
brow never quite justified their serious intent. Maybe the
composers were not good enough, or maybe a minute is not long
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, Livingston stretched his 36 minutes of music into
a full-length evening by reading aloud boring letters from friends
and colleagues and telling anecdotes about his personal life. If
this was a conscious attempt to display concentrated art against a
background of wandering irrelevance, he is indeed a clever young
man. I tend not to give him the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Music lovers who scorn the action film's car-chase-and-dynamite
culture will have to deal with ``Gurrelieder'' as well. There is a
lot of Wagnerian beauty in this 23-part piece, but excess _ and I
mean excess in every category _ is the aesthetic engine that drives
it.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the days when Zubin Mehta used the New York
Philharmonic as his private playground have I heard such noise.
(And Philharmonic listeners may be reminded of those days on
Thursday, when Mehta returns to the orchestra with Mahler's
``Resurrection'' Symphony.)
</P>
<P>
   Simon Rattle conducted the Philadelphia Orchestra in
``Gurrelieder'' at Carnegie Hall. He is perhaps a more serious and
substantial conductor than Mehta, but he was also wise enough not
to flinch from what Schoenberg presented him. I suspect that with
so much raw power at his fingertips, Rattle enjoyed every deafening
climax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gurrelieder'' is arguably too long, too loud and too thick,
not to mention overwrought, though its appeal to my worst instincts
made for a pleasurable evening. The part-writing is unusually
dense, the detail overgrown, the men's chorus voracious.
</P>
<P>
   When the Philadelphia Orchestra turned loose its giant forces en
masse, Carnegie Hall officials could only have hoped that there
were no environmental agents on the premises measuring decibel
levels in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   As to Livingston's program, where does the fragment end and the
aphorism begin? Chopin's Preludes are fragmentary, but with two,
maybe three exceptions, its 24 items are rarely done separately. We
think of the Preludes as a kind of charm bracelet. Maybe the key
relationships bind one little jewel to the next; maybe it is some
kind of osmotic magic. Or maybe we have heard these pieces in the
same succession for so long that a structure has been invented in
our heads that makes the Preludes a single event.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a minute to make an introduction, in music, at least.
You really can't have completeness in such circumstances unless
your opening remarks are so pregnant with implication that the
listener fills in the rest through powers of deduction. None of
Livingston's stable of commissions, by mostly young composers, came
anywhere close to that.
</P>
<P>
   Song form, ground zero for European musical culture, consists of
Tune One, followed by Tune Two, followed by Tune One again. A
couple of minutes, at least, is needed to get all that out.
Composers like Grieg and Mendelssohn (not to mention Schubert) have
composed song-form pieces of three, four and five minutes that are
to my ears as full and satisfying as an hour of Wagner's
``Rienzi.'' Great music can be very short and still complete, but
even brevity needs room to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to call Messiaen's music either long or short,
because its events do not move from one to the next but are instead
stacked on top of one another. The real time from the beginning to
the end of ``Chronochromie'' is not about musical progression; the
listener stands still and gradually sorts out all the parts.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Tommasini last week alluded in these pages to the
psychological length of certain operas: short ones dragging on,
long ones whizzing by. The same applies as well to Bruckner's
Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Symphonies as opposed to Mahler's last
three.
</P>
<P>
   Both composers eat up an awful lot of the clock, but Bruckner is
to me much the briefer. Maybe it is because Bruckner offers fewer
events, even if each is of great size. Bruckner has more or less
the dimensions of Mozart, but the themes, counterthemes,
development sections and recapitulations, such as they are, occupy
more space.
</P>
<P>
   Mahler, on the other hand, seems longer because the events are
many more; the shifts from new episode to new episode become like
successions of chapters that introduce unexpected twists of plot
and whole new sets of characters. The effect is novelistic:
picaresque, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenberg, incidentally, was soon to mend his ways. Well on
their way to abandoning neo-Wagnerian grandeur, his Six Little
Piano Pieces (Op. 19), from 1911 (10 years later than
``Gurrelieder''), each make their move and then can't wait to get
away. All but one of them would have fit Livingston's format
nicely, a couple with seconds to spare.

 New Law Gives Deal on Prescription Drugs  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Under a state law that took effect yesterday, 1.3 million
Californians can use their Medicare cards to get discounts of 10 to
40 percent on prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The discount is aimed at Medicare recipients who do not have a
paid prescription drug benefit through an HMO.
</P>
<P>
   These people, who include seniors and the permanently disabled,
are accustomed to paying the full retail price for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But under a bill written by state Sen. Jackie Speier,
D-Hillsborough, and signed into law last year, such Medicare
recipients are now entitled to get their prescriptions filled at
the lower price that Medi-Cal pays for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Medi-Cal, a state sponsored health program for low-income
people, negotiates below-market prices for a range of prescription
drugs. Speier's bill instructs pharmacies to offer these lower
Medi-Cal prices to Medicare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be of most help to those folks who are really
marginal in income and may be stretching out the prescription by
not taking their full dose of medication,'' said Bonnie Burns, a
Medicare consultant with the Health Insurance Counseling and
Advocacy Program in San Jose,.
</P>
<P>
   The exact savings will vary from drug to drug. Speier's office
issued a list of 10 common medications that averaged out to an
overall savings of 18 percent. For example, a month's supply of the
cholesterol-lowering drug Pravachol, which cost $72 at retail,
would cost $56.89 at the Medi-Cal discount price.
</P>
<P>
   Any pharmacy that fills Medi-Cal prescriptions is required to
offer the discounted price to any Medicare recipients who present a
valid Medicare card. About 80 percent of California pharmacies fill
Medi-Cal prescriptions, Speier's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, the Medicare consultant, said some pharmacies may not be
familiar with the new law, and so Medicare recipients should call
around to get the retail price and the Medi-Cal price before making
a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Speier's office has set up a toll-free number (888-560-4889) to
handle questions or complaints about the new law.

 Computer Exports Get Relief  &HT;     By Carolyn Lochhead 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
For the fourth time since 1993, the Clinton administration loosened
controls on computer exports yesterday, leaving industry executives
grateful for small favors but frustrated by a Washington policy
they said is no sooner updated than it is outdated.
<P>
   The administration nearly doubled the level of computing power
subject to government controls intended to keep high-powered
computers out of the hands of countries considered dangerous,
including Russia, China, India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Under intense industry pressure, the White House agreed to raise
the tightest threshold to 12,500 from 6,500 MTOPS, or ``millions of
theoretical operations per second,'' for military users in
so-called ``Tier 3'' countries. The threshold for civilian users
was raised to 20,000 MTOPS.
</P>
<P>
   The administration said it is trying to ``ensure effective
controls on militarily sensitive technologies while taking into
account the increased availability of commodity products, such as
servers and workstations, of which millions are manufactured and
sold worldwide every year.''
</P>
<P>
   But the industry warned that the new thresholds could be
breached as early as this summer by the new Itanium chip from Intel
Corp. of Santa Clara, which will power servers at 23,000 MTOPS and
be sold in commodity volumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to come here every six months and make the same
arguments and plead for the computer industry, something is wrong,
and the administration and Congress have to fix it,'' said Dan
Hoydysh, director of government relations for Unisys Corp. at a
Monday press briefing on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Hankin, head of government affairs for Sun Microsystems,
said in a telephone interview that the new thresholds ``reacted to
the technology of today, but by this summer they're going to need
to react again.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry argues that the controls, devised during the Reagan
administration to apply to the most powerful computers, are now
restricting exports of ordinary desktop machines widely available
on the mass market.
</P>
<P>
   Because the United States applies restrictions unilaterally, the
controls now threaten the export market for U.S. companies, while
offering no assurance that countries cannot obtain the same
machines elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Control is completely ineffective for chips that are available
by the millions throughout the world,'' Hoydysh said. He dismissed
the government's fixation on MTOPS, saying, ``Nobody has any clue
what they mean,'' he said, ``including many in the administration
and Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun's Hankin agreed that Washington should re-examine ``the
issue of why do you control computing power and can you still
control computing power, or is there a new way to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Many large overseas companies such as Olivetti or Fujitsu could
meet export demand, Hoydysh said, threatening as much as 60 percent
of U.S. computer sales. ``There seems to be a perception (in
Washington) that no one in the world can make these,'' Hoydysh
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in a statement that federal agencies will conduct
another review in April ``to determine if further changes are
warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, praised the administration's
action but said Congress must shrink its own six-month review
process to one month.
</P>
<P>
   The last administration change made last summer only took effect
January 23. Lofgren said the delay prevented Apple Computer and IBM
from shipping their latest desktop personal computers to India and
Israel.

RAVENS' LEWIS IS DENIED BOND ON MURDER CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also FBN-FREEMAN-COLUMN) 
(bl) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ray Lewis, the Baltimore Ravens linebacker who was supposed to
be in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl this week, remained in custody in an
Atlanta jail Tuesday on charges of first-degree murder. The charges
stem from a double homicide that occurred near an Atlanta nightclub
early Monday morning, just hours after the Super Bowl ended.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis appeared in Atlanta Municipal Court on Tuesday morning,
just a few hundred yards from the Georgia Dome, where the Super
Bowl was held Sunday, handcuffed and wearing a red, prison-issued
jumpsuit. There, Municipal Court Solicitor Raines Carter received a
postponement for the preliminary hearing to give prosecutors more
time to talk with witnesses, a routine procedure in murder cases so
that prosecutors and defense lawyers have time for a more complete
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary hearing in the case was set for Feb. 24. No bond
was set, and Lewis will probably remain in custody, unless he is
freed on bond by a higher court judge, released by a local grand
jury, or released by the police if they determine he had nothing to
do with the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Lewis' lawyer, Max Richardson Jr., said Lewis was at
the scene was not involved in the murders. ``We're taking the
position that he was in the wrong place at the wrong time,''
Richardson said. ``From what I've gathered from law enforcement
officers, they know Ray didn't kill these unfortunate victims. They
don't know where the other two men who were involved are, so they
arrest Ray.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson did not elaborate on who the other two men were, but
police said they were looking for other suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' arrest Monday came only three days after National
Football League commissioner Paul Tagliabue asserted that the
league did not have a greater problem with violence by its members
than society at large. Lewis is the second pro football player
charged with murder in two months. Last December, Rae Carruth of
the Carolina Panthers was charged with first-degree murder in the
shooting death of Cherica Adams, who was pregnant with his child.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lewis, 24, was arrested late Monday night in his downtown
Atlanta hotel room. While Atlanta police have been quiet about
their investigation, and had not released the initial police report
by Tuesday night, details about the incident have emerged. Two men
_ Richard Kollar, 24, and Jacinta Baker, 21 _ were stabbed
repeatedly after a fight broke out about 200 yards from the Cobalt
club in Buckhead, a neighborhood and entertainment district in
northeast Atlanta. Lewis _ in town for the Super Bowl and for an
autograph session _ has been linked to a group that left the scene
at about 4 a.m. Monday. Witnesses said six men piled into a stretch
Lincoln Navigator limousine, which had Maryland license plates.
</P>
<P>
   The two victims, who had no apparent relationship with Lewis'
party, were found in pools of blood next to a sidewalk about two
blocks from the club. The 30-foot vehicle was found behind a hotel
about two miles away from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens said they had not spoken to Lewis, but in a statement
said: ``We respect the investigative and judicial processes that
are taking place. We are monitoring all of this as best as we
can.''
</P>
<P>
   The league, stunned by the arrest of one of its biggest
defensive stars, had no comment on Lewis' arrest, although Gene
Washington, the league's chief disciplinarian, called the arrest
devastating during a radio show. In response to inquiries, the
league referred reporters to Tagliabue's state of the league
address last Friday, in which he said he did not feel the NFL had a
disproportional problem with violent behavior, and said that the
vast majority of the 2,500 players who are in the league during a
season are good citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our track record, the track record of our players, is far
better than society at-large,'' Tagliabue said. ``We have fewer
incidents involving N.F.L. players than society at-large has. . . .
Can we separate ourselves from society? Of course not. We can't
predict what NFL players will do any more than we can predict
students shooting other students or workers shooting fellow
workers.''
</P>
<P>
   But one NFL team official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said Ravens officials had recently become concerned
about some of Lewis' new friends. The team had been expected to
meet with him when he returned from the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens were apparently worried about an incident last
November, when a woman said Lewis punched her in the face, sending
her tumbling against the bar in a Baltimore-area nightclub. He was
charged with second-degree assault and was expected to stand trial
Feb. 9, but that date will be delayed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The devil is busy, always after God's children,'' Lewis,
maintaining his innocence, said of the incident. ``He is always
trying to get you one way or another.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Cobalt club is popular with high-profile sports
figures. Its owner, Charles Cook, said Tuesday that David Justice,
the Cleveland Indians outfielder who used to play for the Braves,
was at the club Sunday night. Cook insisted that nothing happened
at the club and that Lewis' party walked out after the club was
closed at 3 a.m., with six off-duty police officers standing
outside providing security for the club.
</P>
<P>
   In Nov. 1998, Lewis signed a four-year deal for $26 million,
making him the league's highest-paid linebacker. But his path has
been pockmarked by unhappiness. He was the Ravens' first-round
draft pick in 1996 on the same April day that his best friend and
University of Miami teammate, Marlin Barnes, was buried, a victim
of an on-campus murder. He often wears a shirt with Barnes' picture
picture on it.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis played for the University of Miami from 1993 to 1995, and
entered the 1996 draft after his junior year as an all-American.
Coral Gables police twice investigated Lewis for alleged battery
against two different girlfriends a year apart during his college
days. Charges were never brought in either case.  &QL;

 _ SF CHRON   Tardy Filing A Red Flag For IRS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: Regarding your column last week on avoiding scrutiny by the IRS:
I'm curious about why a mismatch between income I report and that
reported by my clients on 1099s would be `disastrous,' as you put
it.
<P>
   Because I'm on a cash accounting basis, I routinely wait until
January of each year to deposit checks received in December, hence
forestalling paying taxes on those amounts for a year.
Nevertheless, such money is reported by my clients for the year in
which the checks were issued. In other words, there is always a
mismatch between what I report and the cumulative total reported by
my clients on 1099s. Surely the IRS is aware that this is a common
discrepancy. So why do you call it `disastrous'?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Better watch out. Your income reporting practices are improper
and could subject you to penalties, according to Ernest F. Howard,
a CPA from Los Angeles and a member of the State Tax Committee of
the California Society of CPAs.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are that income is taxable to the recipient when he or
she has the ability to control the money. If you don't go to the
post office to pick up the payment or you leave it for weeks in
your in-basket before depositing it, that is not kosher. You still
have ``constructive receipt,'' the legal term for access to the
cash, and are obligated to report it within the tax year received.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if you have the ability to receive payment but instruct
the client not to make payment until the beginning of the year, it
could subject you to negligence penalties plus the taxes due and
interest. If you have a pattern of improperly deferring income, and
the amounts are $50,000 a year or more, you could face criminal
tax-fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   Howard says the IRS prepares a report of mismatches called
CP-2000, which tracks what you report as income and what others
report they paid you. If what you report as income is the same or
more than what others report they paid you, there will not be a
mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   One reason a mismatch may not have been triggered in your case
is that some of your customers may not be filing a Form 1099. So
your actual income may be underreported on both sides. But that
doesn't mean you should ignore the reporting requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if you have a mismatch, it increases the odds of having
your returns audited, which is costly, time-consuming and
emotionally draining even if the IRS finds nothing wrong.
</P>

 Giving It Her Best Shot  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Mona Lisa Wallace decided she needed more than a microphone and
slide projector to make her investment pitch at the first venture
capital forum for women entrepreneurs last Thursday.
<P>
   So she rolled onto the stage a shopping cart filled with
environmentally correct products.
</P>
<P>
   Then she told several hundred potential investors at the Oracle
Conference Center in Redwood City that her San Francisco e-commerce
company, ShopEco.com, is targeting a very fragmented $25 billion
market.
</P>
<P>
   The cart and its contents symbolized the online site's capacity
to pull together a broad inventory of ecologically friendly
products from fleece jackets made from old plastic bottles to
recycled paper napkins to organic peppermints.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, a lawyer-turned CEO, said she initially planned to
lecture her audience on global warming, water purity and food
safety. But she was advised by the managing director of an investor
group called Angel's Forum, to pull the ``purse strings,'' and not
the ``heart strings.''
</P>
<P>
   Called Springboard 2000, the unprecedented conference was
designed to give carefully selected women entrepreneurs 17 minutes
each to convince some of Silicon Valley's leading investors to put
up money or arrange follow-up meetings to learn more.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are 8.5 million women-owned businesses in the
United States, according to the Small Business Administration, they
are woefully neglected by private equity investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women entrepreneurs are the most dynamic, fastest-growing
sector of our economy but we are still largely invisible in the
investment community,'' said Kay Koplovitz, chair of the National
Women's Business Council, which co-sponsored Springboard 2000 with
the Forum for Women Entrepreneurs. Last year, only about 5 percent
of the nearly $30 billion venture capital financing flowed to
women-backed startups.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the one-day event aim to push that up to 15 percent
by the end of next year. Initially the conference planners thought
they would receive about 100 business plans from women
entrepreneurs but 350 applications poured in. MBA students at
Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley helped
whittle down the list. Venture capital investors screened about 45
candidates, with 27 making the final cut.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most investment conferences, which give speakers little
more than a time slot, this one provided extensive hand-holding.
Those making presentations were offered coaching from VCs, bankers
and professional speaking consultants. The women even went through
a dress rehearsal days before the event.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 angel, venture and corporate investors as well as
accountants, lawyers and consultants paid up to $650 each to hear
the high-tech auditions.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching for $1 million to $20 million is every bit as demanding
as auditioning for a part in Hollywood. It's not just a matter of
having a good script or business plan, but having an effective
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The women entrepreneurs invited to speak were not new to the
financial stage. Each had at least raised private money from
friends, family and independent angel investors.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a few had run previous startups and already raised
millions of dollars from VC firms for their latest ventures. Still,
they said they had plenty to learn about perfecting their pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Varsha Rao, co-founder and co-president of Eve.com, a San
Francisco online vendor of 170 beauty product brands, has raised
$28.7 million and is looking for $25 million more. The Harvard MBA
and former McKinsey consultant is used to making presentations but
she found advice from coaches about slowing down her delivery,
acting natural and coming up with a ``hook'' to catch the audience
very helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Rao decided to start at the beginning and tell the story of how
she and her partner, Stanford MBA Mariam Naficy, got the name
Eve.com.
</P>
<P>
   It was an obvious choice for the online cosmetics company but
they discovered a 6-year-old named Eve Rogers already had the
domain name and her mother owned 400 Web addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Eve's mother initially thought Rao and her partner wanted to
start a porn site. But after explaining their business, treating
mother and daughter to a trip to Disneyland and pledging to pay a
major part of Eve's college tuition, they won rights to the name.
``That was our toughest negotiation,'' said Rao, who likes to
practice giving presentations with her eyes closed.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking coach Kim Marinucci of Winning Pitch in Palo Alto said
it's important to know your first line and last line but ``don't
get scripted.'' If you do, your remarks are likely to come off as
canned rather than conversational and convincing.
</P>
<P>
   Krishna Subramanian, CEO of Kovair in San Jose, had the
unenviable position of being the first Springboard 2000 presenter
at 8:20 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of venture capitalist James Robbins of San Jose's
Software Business Cluster, Subramanian had already whittled down
her number of slides and honed her usual 40-minute pitch to a tight
17 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But to wake up the audience and get them interested in hearing
about her software for managing business-to-business customer
relationships, she decided to start it off with a joke: ``If Hamlet
were alive today, what would he ask?,'' she queried. ``To B2B or
not B2B, that is the question.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. The audience laughed. And Subramanian, a former Sun
Microsystems manager who is looking for $10 million in additional
financing for her 10-month-old startup, relaxed and eased into her
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Punita Pandey, founder and CEO of netCustomer.com, decided to
launch her presentation by contrasting the negative view many
online shoppers have of customer service and the way they feel
about her company's product which allows online shoppers to get
immediate responses to their e-mail questions.
</P>
<P>
   She quoted a customer of someone else's service who was told
``we don't know the status of your order,'' after repeated e-mails
and phone calls to customer service and being on hold for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Pandey, a UC Berkeley MBA whose year-old company has received $1
million in seed financing and is looking for $15 million more, then
observed, ``That is a reflection of e-frustration. A lot of online
customers are left holding the virtual bag with no help.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a netCustomer.com user said the service ``is the
best I have ever seen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pandey, her two coaches, Helen Ingerson from APV
Technology Partners and Silvia Fernandez from Silicon Valley Bank,
helped her highlight her main message and advised her to mention
early and forcefully that her company has the stamp of approval
from some major customers, including Dell and Qualcomm.
</P>
<P>
   Menekse Gencer, chief marketing officer of Vistify in Santa
Monica, used a different approach to establishing rapport with the
audience. She told a story about how her great aunt in Istanbul
would lower a basket from her third-story window to the grocer boy
who filled her orders. Then she segued to Vistify which is creating
a kitchen appliance with touch-screen pictures that consumers can
press to instantly order and pay for groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Gencer, a former PricewaterhouseCoopers consultant who is
looking for $25 million in second-round financing, said the
coaching was helpful. ``I was told to tell a story and hold a
conversation with the audience,'' she said. ``And have people focus
on you, not the graphics.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge of your subject, careful preparation and coaching are
useful. But they don't assure success.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Moore, co-founder of Signet Assurance Co. in San
Francisco, learned this the hard way. She carefully practiced her
presentation. With the help of Marinucci, she used images,
including a picture of a pack of Fleischman's yeast, to drive home
the point that Signet's e-commerce transaction services are the
critical ingredient needed by online businesses to guarantee
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   But during her presentation, Moore suffered a classic attack of
stage fright. After losing her train of thought, she stood silently
for several minutes clicking back and forth through her
presentation slides before regaining some composure.
</P>
<P>
   Getting lost during a presentation is not that uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your mouth gets cottony and your forehead gets hot, take a
breath and consciously exhale,'' advises Mill Valley speaking coach
Dan Sapp. ``This might help release the tension and signal your
central nervous system that you are not under attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving a good presentation involves style as well as substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to get outside your own frame of reference,'' said
Kathryn Hanson, CEO of eMentoring.com in Cupertino.
</P>
<P>
   ``My coach reminded me not everyone knows buzzwords like MOU for
memorandum of understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   The founder of a previous startup called CustomerCast and a
veteran of Hewlett-Packard and Silicon Graphics, Hanson is looking
for up to $2 million in seed-round financing to deliver business
education materials from universities online to companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned not to speak too fast or get mired down in
details,'' said Sara Frankel, CEO of BestSelf, a San Francisco
online weight management service that is looking for $8 million in
second-round financing.

 SF CHRON  
 Bill of Rights Proposed for Phone Users  
 By Todd Wallack 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
State regulators yesterday proposed giving Californians a telephone
``bill of rights'' to protect them from cramming, slamming and
other abuses by phone companies.
<P>
   The proposal would guarantee phone customers clear information
about prices and services, accurate bills, a simple way to correct
billing errors, a choice of telephone companies, the ability to
participate in public policy discussions and the power to keep
their personal information private.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes just six weeks after a California Public
Utilities Commission judge fined Pacific Bell $44 million for
marketing abuses, including selling customers a deluxe package of
extra phone features, like three-way calling, under a plan labeled
``the basics.'' Pacific Bell is appealing the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   But PUC Commissioner Carl Wood said his proposal, based on a
report by the commission's telecommunications staff, is aimed at
the entire telecommunications industry. He said the PUC receives
400 calls and 300 letters every business day from customers, mostly
complaints. The figure has also grown sharply in recent weeks, said
Linda Woods, manager of the PUC's consumer services division.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most common gripes include slamming, when a
long-distance company takes over a customer's account without
permission, and cramming, when a company puts fraudulent charges on
a customer's bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult for consumers to discover what their rights
are,'' Wood said. ``They are frequently buried in very arcane
tariffs,'' or legal documents filed with state regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said he expects the other four PUC commissioners to support
the initial proposal. But the author of the PUC staff report said
it will be trickier to persuade everyone to approve specific rules
needed to ensure each of the broader rights, like ``privacy'' and
``disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the rub,'' said Robert Wullenjohn, a PUC regulatory
analyst. For example, the staff report recommends that fine print
in ads be printed in at least 10-point type, slightly larger than
the letters in this article, to make sure consumers can read it.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the full commission, the plan could be
implemented as soon as fall, Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   Watchdog groups lauded the plan, but said they worried that
industry lobbyists would torpedo the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a power struggle between industry and the public,'' said
Chris Witteman of the Greenlining Institute. ``I'm not optimistic.
The industry (representatives) are very strong and have a lot of
influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell spokesman John Britton, however, said he likes what he
has heard so far about the plan. For example, he said the company
never sells customer names and addresses to outside firms. ``The
bottom line is we're already living by this, and if you're going to
make all (telephone companies) conform to the same rules, that is a
positive,'' Britton said.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom, the country's second-largest long-distance
company, said it needed more time to review the proposals before it
could comment.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the PUC is also considering updating the customer
service rules that govern local telephone companies. For instance,
companies are currently required to answer most calls in 20
seconds, but are allowed to shunt them to automated answering
systems or busy signals, according to Paul Stein, an attorney with
the Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco consumer group. Critics
want the rules revised to reflect new technologies, such as voice
mail, that frustrate customers even while phone companies are
complying with the rules.

CELEBRATING LA DIFFERENCE AND THREE OBJECTS OF DESIRE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Terrence Rafferty is the critic at large for GQ magazine.  
 By TERRENCE RAFFERTY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Day for Night,'' Francois Truffaut's 1973 comedy about
filmmaking, a young actor with girlfriend problems goes around
asking everyone he knows, ``Are women magic?'' The other characters
stare back at him with pity and horror. Doesn't he know? Any French
film could tell the poor boy the answer: ``But of course.''
</P>
<P>
   The French, a stubborn people, may be the last nation on earth
for whom the ``magic'' of women is a simple, unshakable article of
faith. The French Institute/Alliance Francaise in New York is
currently conducting a kind of revival meeting devoted to
reasserting this durable tenet of the national religion (i.e., the
cinema) in the form of a 10-film tribute to Carole Bouquet,
Sandrine Bonnaire and Juliette Binoche.
</P>
<P>
   Strictly speaking, these women have little in common. But if you
compare them with American actresses of similar accomplishment
(say, Julia Roberts, Meg Ryan and Michelle Pfeiffer), you can't
help noticing that the Frenchwomen are, collectively, a much graver
and more mysterious bunch. They do not flirt. They rarely smile.
The camera gazes at them in awe.
</P>
<P>
   Bouquet had her first significant movie role in Luis Bunuel's
``Obscure Object of Desire'' (1977), in which he used her lovely,
fine-featured, but not terribly expressive face as a blank screen
for the projection of viewers' fantasies. That's more or less the
way she has been used ever since. It's no accident that she is the
only one of the actresses in this series who has been a Bond girl
(in ``For Your Eyes Only,'' 1981) _ or that she has given her most
memorable performances in Chanel commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Bouquet's career is conclusive proof that in the French cinema
it's enough for a gorgeous woman simply to be on the screen _ to
hold still and allow us to ponder the enigma of her beauty.
</P>
<P>
   American movies are, to put it gently, rather less
contemplative, and distinctly less keen on enigmas. In the '30s and
'40s, our movies would routinely pause for long, enraptured
close-ups of a female star _ a Garbo or a Dietrich _ but I haven't
seen many of those at the multiplex lately. (Hollywood's notion of
movie ``magic'' has evolved well past the merely human.)
</P>
<P>
   In France, however, la difference is still considered important
enough to qualify as a special effect. And even actresses less
goddessy than Bouquet are viewed almost reverentially by native
filmmakers. Sandrine Bonnaire, who is by no means conventionally
pretty, nevertheless receives the full femme fatale treatment in
Patrice Leconte's 1989 thriller, ``Monsieur Hire'' (screening Feb.
15), in which she is the object of a voyeur's obsession.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnaire's greatest physical attribute is her walk, which is
brisk and androgynously sexy _ she's the Gary Cooper of French
actresses _ but what gives her a star's allure is her ability to
hold her emotions suggestively in reserve. She always plays a woman
who is hiding something: the keeper of a dark secret not only in
``Monsieur Hire,'' but also in Jacques Rivette's languorous moral
thriller, ``Secret Defense'' (1999), and Claude Chabrol's country
house shocker, ``La Ceremonie'' (1995; screening Feb. 22).
</P>
<P>
   In her best role, in Agnes Varda's ``Vagabond'' (1985; screening
Tuesday), Bonnaire's character is a mystery even to herself: a
young woman who inexplicably chooses to live as a homeless drifter,
wandering the countryside in the dead of winter. She is not crazy;
she is not an ideologically motivated dropout from bourgeois
society; she is not pining for a lost love. You never really know
her, and you can't take your eyes off her.
</P>
<P>
   Only French actresses, it seems, can get away with acting that
is so minimalist and so doggedly inscrutable. (Isabelle Huppert got
through her first couple of dozen movies with, by actual count, two
facial expressions _ neither a happy one.) But although this style
can be a useful corrective to the insanely eager-to-please manner
of American performers, all that solemn glamour can also become
ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   What's French for ``Get over yourself''? Perhaps the reason
Juliette Binoche is the French actress who has had the most
international success in the last 15 years is that her formula for
feminine magic includes some old-fashioned romantic warmth.
</P>
<P>
   This series, which features only films by French directors,
misrepresents her somewhat: to appreciate her range you would also
need to watch, at the very least, Krzysztof Kieslowski's ``Blue,''
Anthony Minghella's ``The English Patient'' (1996) and Philip
Kaufman's ``Unbearable Lightness of Being.''
</P>
<P>
   The Institute's selections have the virtue of relative
unfamiliarity, though: Jean-Paul Rappeneau's vigorous, dopey 1995
costume drama, ``The Horseman on the Roof'' (screening March 14),
and two of Leos Carax's wild exercises in morbid romanticism,
``Mauvais Sang'' (``Bad Blood,'' 1987; screening Feb. 29) and ``The
Lovers on the Bridge'' (1991; screening March 7).
</P>
<P>
   ``Mauvais Sang'' does, in its berserk way, demonstrate what
separates Binoche from the other French actresses of her
generation. It's a neo-Godardian caper in which her character is
named Anna in obvious homage to Godard's early '60s muse Anna
Karina. She has little dialogue, and for long stretches her sole
function is to accept the admiration of the two crooks who are in
love with her, and of Carax, who worships her.
</P>
<P>
   In these passages, the film seems to have no subject other than
her pretty and oddly peaceful-looking features. Not even Garbo or
Dietrich could have survived that scrutiny: there's been nothing
like it since D.W. Griffith apotheosized Lillian Gish in ``Broken
Blossoms.''
</P>
<P>
   But Binoche does survive it, by maintaining, just as Gish did,
an appealing modesty in the face of this embarrassing adoration.
And then, gradually, she even transcends it _ again as Gish did _
by acting, filling in the sketchy outlines of her character with
nothing but delicate shifts of expression in her big brown eyes.
Her Anna begins as an obscure object of desire, but ends,
improbably, as the most fully realized human being in the imagined
world she inhabits.
</P>
<P>
   That's the best kind of magic a woman can have.

15 ARE INJURED IN MEXICO CITY AS STUDENTS CLASH OVER STRIKE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Students opposed to a strike at the national
university clashed on Tuesday with strikers armed with clubs,
leaving at least fifteen people injured, according to the police.
It was the worst violence between students since the strike began
last April.
</P>
<P>
   At midday, about 200 students who want to end the strike marched
peacefully into a preparatory school that is part of the national
university system but is outside the main campus, on the eastern
edge of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   A band of a few dozen strikers arrived and began to beat the
students who were inside the school.
</P>
<P>
   Riot police took up positions outside the school gates but did
not enter the building. The city police may not operate on the
grounds of the National Autonomous University of Mexico without
special federal orders.
</P>
<P>
   The police evacuated the injured students, including two with
severe head wounds, to a hospital. At nightfall, several dozen
antistrike students, including several more who were injured,
remained trapped inside the building.
</P>
<P>
   The police recovered one homemade fire bomb, which was thrown by
the strikers but did not ignite.
</P>
<P>
   The strikers have refused to end their occupation of the
university until the administration grants all of their six demands
for free tuition and looser academic standards.
</P>
<P>
   The university's president, Juan Ramon de la Fuente, has agreed
to concede to most, but not all, of the demands.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Gertz Manero, Mexico City's police chief, said he had
called for help at 3 p.m. from the federal police, who are
authorized to enter the university. But several hours after the
fighting erupted, no federal police had appeared, Gertz complained
on a talk radio show.
</P>
<P>
   Gertz said five strikers had been arrested outside the school
because they were carrying homemade bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after a referendum he organized showed that a
majority in the university supported ending the strike, de la
Fuente called on the students and faculty to try to take back their
own departments and schools peacefully.

TEXT OF CLINTON INTERVIEW ON THE ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CLINTON-ECON) 
(mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following is a transcript provided by the White
House of a roundtable interview in the Oval Office Tuesday with
President Clinton and reporters from The New York Times, The
Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The economy. Is this the Reagan boom or the Clinton boom?
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think it's an American boom. And I will
rather than take the bait, let me tell you what I basically think.
If you analyze what brought us to this moment, I think it was the
general restructuring of the American private sector and the tough
years of the '80s when we had to become more competitive in the
global economy. I think, even more it was the explosion of the
high-tech sector and those technologies rifling through the rest of
the economy. And they are 8 percent of our employment, 30 percent
of our growth.
</P>
<P>
   I think the American workers deserve a lot of credit because
they became in the 1980s very sophisticated about the way the world
economy works, and you haven't seen these enormous wage demands
that would bring on inflation, even as the labor markets have
tightened.
</P>
<P>
   So I think you have to start with those three things. I think
Chairman Greenspan deserves a lot of credit for two things,
principally. One is, more than many people in his position, and I
thinkmore than some of his counterparts in other countries, he
made decisions based on evidence over ideology. That is _ or
evidence over conventional wisdom. Somehow he sensed somewhere
along the way there was something fundamentally different going on,
and he realized he did not have to stop it because we had ``X''
years at 3.5 or 4 percent growth, or some other indicator that
always before had been a good rule of thumb. So I think that's
important.
</P>
<P>
   And then I think another thing that's important, something that
I think my predecessor should get some credit for, is that we've
had a bipartisan consensus in the White House toward open markets,
and the open markets have helped to preserve this boom because they
have forced us to remain competitive and they have been a powerful
brake on inflation. Keep in mind, it's been _ I don't pretend
there's no hazard in the size of our trade deficit. You may want to
come back and deal with it, but they have been a powerful brake on
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   And then the last thing I would say is I think that what we did
in 1993 and our subsequent actions all along the way have made a
not insignificant contribution. I think what happened when I got
elected is _ I think one of you characterized the so-called
recovery that had been underway for some months as anemic and some
of the people were calling it a triple-dip economy. So _ and you
couldn't totally keep the American people down forever, but they
couldn't feel the benefits of it, and unemployment was still high.
Why? Because we had these very, very high interest rates because
that was the price of the good times we bought with deficit
spending in the early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   So I would argue to the contrary that while I would give my
predecessors due credit for keeping the markets open and
encouraging competitiveness, I think that this whole idea of _ we
may have gotten out of the recession of the late '70s and early
'80s with this massive deficit spending, but to build it
structurally into the economy was a big burden. And we decided we
would break it structurally. And I think what happened is _ I
remember when Lloyd Bentsen announced a lot of our economic program
in December of '92, before we even took office, there was a big
rise in the bond market, interest rates fell, and it just took off
from there. And then when we actually passed it, people could see
we were serious, and I think it was like just breaking through a
dam. We got interest rates down. This has been an investment-led
recovery with the highest percentage of jobs in the private sector,
I think of any recovery in modern history.
</P>
<P>
   We've been able to hold down spending as a percentage of GDP. We
did raise revenues, and we should have, and we did it I think in a
way we should have, because we also gave tax _ low-income working
people. And we saved enough money to nearly double our investment
in education and training. But I think that was a big thing.
</P>
<P>
   Then I think the continued attention to the economic environment
has been important. I think passing NAFTA and the GATT, WTO was
important. I think managing the Mexican financial crisis, which was
an unpopular as could be, was important. Passing the '97 Balanced
Budget Act. Insisting that we not stray from the path of fiscal
discipline once we began to run surpluses. The Telecommunications
Bill, the Financial Modernization Bill. I think all these things,
even before they were actually felt, helped to create a mind-set of
confidence, which it seems to me is critical for recovery going on
this long.
</P>
<P>
   So that's what we tried to do. But I think all those other
players in this deserve an enormous amount of credit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Well, in this situation that so many things have gone so
well, what do you worry about that might bring it to an end, that
might give us a recession instead of more growth?
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESIDENT: Well, obviously with _ it's highly unusual for a
country to have a budget surplus as big as ours and a trade deficit
this big, as you know. And the reason, of course, as many of you
have written, is that while we have now gotten into significant
savings in the public sector, we still have a very large amount of
private debt.
</P>
<P>
   So I worry a little bit about the impact of the trade deficit
that big for a long time. That's one of the reasons I hope we can
get China into the WTO and open that market more, because it's the
biggest source of our troubles.
</P>
<P>
   But I think that the worries _ let me just say this. You all
know the argument better than I do, but the basic argument is,
look, those who are pessimistic about the future, is the economy is
so good and the stock market is so high, and people have a lot of
wealth in those kinds of assets that they think they can afford
much bigger debt, whether it's business debt or consumer debt. The
people loaning the money are so confident because the economy is so
good, they're loaning money at the margins they might not otherwise
loan if they had a good night's sleep and were totally sort of
skeptical. That's basically the argument.
</P>
<P>
   I'm concerned about that. My concern is mitigated by the fact
that the government is in surplus and we're paying down the debt,
and that lowers our risk a little bit _ quite a little bit _ and
that a lot of this money that's been borrowed has been borrowed for
business investment and will have a growth component to it and will
increase the long-term growth and stability of our economy.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing that no one seems to know how to fix in America is
how we get the personal savings rate back up. Last year I proposed
something _ my USA accounts, which got no traction in the Congress,
and this year Gene and I, we came up with this retirement savings
account, hoping it would get a little traction, because we do need
to do something to try to increase the personal savings rates of
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But I think, again, if we can just keep moving in the right
direction and realize that this is a potential danger out there,
I'm not as troubled by it as I would be if we were running a
deficit or if all this money was for consumer spending, or if we
didn't have a better debt-to-wealth ratio than we do.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can I ask a brief follow-up question there, which is that you
mentioned two problems and then lumped them together _ one being
consumer debt, and the other being the trade deficit. Do you think
the trade deficit is, per se, worrisome? And if so, what is that
worry? And secondly, other than retirement savings account and
China into WTO, is there anything concrete and specific that you
can do to address either of those?
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don't think so. Not unless we become much
more protectionist and just shut profits off. But I think that
would be a great error because, as I said, I think the open markets
have spurred innovation in America and the imports themselves have
kept inflation down. And they have not been a job killer. We're
over 20 million ahead of where we were in '93.
</P>
<P>
   So, I'll tell you, what bothers me about it is that if we have a
trade deficit of this size, it has to be _ and we have all this
personal debt, all this stuff has got to be financed. And because
our personal _ our savings rates are fairly low, about 40 percent
of our debt is held by non-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like the Japanese who can _ for all their problems, an
enormous _ I think like 80-some percent of their debt _ and their
government deficits this year are something like 8 percent of GDP,
or something. Anyway, some real big number. I don't want to be held
to it, but it's a big number.
</P>
<P>
   And because of their personal savings habits, they hold the vast
majority of their own debt. We don't.
</P>
<P>
   So as long as we're a good bet, as long as people feel good
about the American economy, they won't liquidate their holdings.
But what you _ the reason this is a worry is that people feel that,
with a lot of our exposure overseas and a lot of our wealth in the
stock market, that difficult events in one place can have a bigger
reverberating effect in others. That's basically the down side
worry.
</P>
<P>
   So I'm doing what I can to minimize that by running a surplus,
and by trying to keep our markets open and trying to push other
people's markets open _ the biggest thing we do is get China into
the WTO. But I think that we do need to find ways to encourage
Americans to save more.
</P>
<P>
   This is not something we have to just turn around overnight.
But, see, a lot of Americans believe that their savings _ let me
just say this _ I think we may be under-estimating a little bit the
rate of savings because two-thirds of the American people own their
own homes, for the first time in history. And that's normally not
counted in the savings rates.
</P>
<P>
   But if you talk to somebody that's making a mortgage payment,
even if they're in the first two or three years, most of it is
going to interest and they're not getting a lot of principal yet,
they see that as savings. So I think it's a concern, but there's no
such thing as an economy with no concern. A free market has a lot
of variables and, by definition, there are going to be problems.
This is a high-class problem and we just have to watch it, and
manage it, and try to ameliorate it as it goes along.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As you say, there's a limit to what you can do if Congress
doesn't adopt that proposal or vote for the Chinese in the WTO. And
we do have a Republican Congress, which limits what you can get
through in the remaining months of your term. But you also have the
power of executive orders and regulation. And I was wondering if
you expect in the remaining months here in office that you will use
that tool increasingly to accomplish goals in your agenda,
particularly in the economic area _ if you might specify what
things you're looking at.
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESIDENT: I haven't made a decision on that yet, so I don't
know. Basically, I've used my executive authority to try to
eliminate discrimination or accelerate work on a problem, like the
medical errors, or to implement the Antiquities Act to save land,
natural lands that I thought could not be saved otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   So I've had pretty good success in working with this Congress on
economic issues, and I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't have some
progress in this Congress on economic issues _ on long-term
investments, even on tax policy _might make a little headway.
</P>
<P>
   The last session, once we got the business about the Community
Reinvestment Act squared away, we passed that sweeping Financial
Modernization Act, which I think, on balance, will be a plus for
our economy. I think it will increase the efficiency of the capital
markets, at minimum increasing risk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But do you expect to increase the use of executive order or
regulation in the next few months?
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESIDENT: Do you have a specific thing in mind?
</P>
<P>
   Q: One that comes to mind is how hard to push OSHA on ergonomics
and things like that to improve workplace standards.
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESIDENT: I literally _ I have made no decision on that,
and I have given no thought to that. As we go along during this
year, we'll try to assess what it looks like we can get done in the
Congress and what we can't, and whether such things would be
appropriate. And I'll try o balance my concern for the welfare of
the working people with my awareness that the most important thing
I can do for them is to keep this economy going.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One of the last couple of years Congress has effectively
broken the spending caps -- a big pot of money on the table this
year, a big agenda from your administration, a lot of other pent-up
demand for programs from both parties on the Hill. What do you do,
what new mechanism do you come up with to maintain fiscal
responsibility in that environment?
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESIDENT: I think you have to _ first of all, I think there
are pent-up demands, because we have gone -- we've plainly have
things that need doing in the areas, particularly, of education and
health care in America, and in the area of scientific,
technological and biomedical research. I think those areas are big
demands because we have big issues out there.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't think it's complicated how you keep fiscal
discipline. I want to have fewer gimmicks in this budget than we
had last year. I mean, last year, Congress wanted to spend a bunch
of money, but they wanted to act like they weren't, so they named
all kinds of things for emergencies. I think even Head Start wound
up being an emergency. But anyway, it was _ so what I tried to do
is take the money they spent last time and make it the baseline,
and then assume a reasonable amount of inflation based on the
spending patterns of the last five years or so, in projected
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, over and above that, we said, okay, here is the projected
surplus, and you can argue about how this surplus ought to be
spent, but this saves all the Social Security surplus for Social
Security, and from my point of view, we couldn't have a tax cut
that would be so big as to either prevent this or future Congresses
from putting the requisite money into Medicare when we double the
number of people on Medicare over the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   We need to have enough to invest in these critical areas of our
national life. But we also are going to have to restrain spending
in some areas, but let me remind you, we now have the smallest
federal government in 40 years. We've eliminated hundreds of
programs. We've _ government spending is a percentage of GDP; I
think it's the lowest it's been since 1966. So we're going to have
to continue to make choices, but we shouldn't be embarrassed about
investing in those things that need investing in.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   We've got the biggest group of school kids we've ever had, the
most diverse group. We know what works, we know that these
after-school programs and summer school programs work, and that a
lot of them are going to school in lousy facilities.
</P>
<P>
   We know that we're going to have 2 million teachers retire. We
can pretend that we don't have to deal with these things as I think
_ but we can _ what I want to say is, we can deal with these
things, we can have an affordable tax cut, and we can do it in a
way that doesn't, in effect, make a lot of trouble for ourselves
five years or 10 years down the road if the projections we have
don't turn out to be right.
</P>
<P>
   I just want to see us do all these things within a framework
which will not imperil our Social Security and Medicare obligations
and it won't stop us from paying the debt down.
</P>
<P>
   But _ and Congress, by the way _ I was interested in the CBO;
they offered three different projections for the surplus, and one
is based on a freeze, which would require a 20-percent cut in
domestic spending and defense spending. One is premised on what. .
.
</P>
<P>
   GENE SPERLING, White House Economic Policy Adviser: One is the
freeze, and that probably cuts NDD by about 40 percent. The other
takes _ kind of takes the caps, and so that has much harsher cut
the first few years. But then it eventually grows to inflation, so
that's kind of not as bad as a freeze in the out-years, but worse
in the first few years. And then the third they just took. . .
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESIDENT: . . .last year's spending plus inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In your list of things in the State of the Union message, you
didn't discuss Social Security, really, except in terms of the
surplus and setting that aside. Do you feel any urgency in
reforming Social Security in a more fundamental way?
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I would love to. My problem is, I can't _
Mr. Archer and I tried last year and we didn't get many converts,
and I couldn't get much excitement in either party for doing it.
But let me say, reforming it means _ in traditional terms, it means
taking it out 75 _ years, putting a 75-year lock on it. If you just
take the interest savings from the debt reduction attributable to
the Social Security tax and put that in a Social Security trust
fund, you can take it to 2050. That's an easy step, and that gets
it beyond the life of virtually all the baby boomers. Maybe not
all, but most of the baby boomers will not be around after 2050.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it ought to be taken to 2075, and I would still like to do
it. And I thought I had _ Gene and I thought we had figured out a
way where we thought the Democrats were and where we thought Mr.
Archer was, and figure out how to put it together in something we
could sell, but we just couldn't generate enough energy behind it.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that it would be very unwise for Congress to let more
than a year or two go by without addressing this. And I am still
willing to do it, but if, because this is an election year and
because it's a presidential election year, I can't get it done, I
think the best thing is for us to leave our proposal behind and get
as much as we can done on Medicare _ I do think we've got a much
better chance to get some actual structural reforms in Medicare
this year. The Senate Finance Committee is going to have hearings;
Senator Breaux came back with another version of his bill this
year. We've got our version of Medicare reform. I think the
Congress has some inclination to provide some prescription drug
relief. So I think there's a good chance you will get some
structural reform in Medicare this year that will also lengthen the
life of the trust fund, although there is no consensus, I think, in
the Republican Party on putting the money into the trust fund that
I think will be necessary to really get it beyond the baby boom
generation.
</P>
<P>
   But I think it's more likely to get structural Medicare reform
and structural Social Security reform this year because of the
where the Congress is in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you plan any new proposals on either to jump-start that
process?
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESIDENT: Well, we're working on Medicare right now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And will that be part of your budget next week?
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESIDENT: Yes _ well, we basically had the same proposal _
we will start with the proposal we had last time, which they didn't
reject; they just didn't take it up. The commitment of the Senate
is that Senator Roth's committee will take up all the different
Medicare proposals, and that's when the negotiation will start, and
we'll go in and negotiate with them and try to work something out.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's very important. And Medicare has got _ my budget
takes it, I think, out to 2025, right? Where are we now with
Medicare?
</P>
<P>
   SPERLING: It's at 2014. Our proposal takes it out to a little
past 2025.
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESIDENT: So I think that _ anything they would agree to do
_ I think they all know we've got to put at least _ at least I
think they feel that we should put at least 20 years on it. I would
like to do more. So I'm hoping that we can get a Medicare
agreement; I think there's a pretty good chance we'll get one of
those.
</P>
<P>
   And keep in mind, Social Security -- we will at least maximize
the options available for an early resolution of that by saving the
surplus, particularly if I can get them also to dedicate the
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Then their options will be much easier. And there are lots of
other things there are lots of other things I need to do. I think
that something that costs money in the short run, but makes you
money in the long run is lifting the earnings limits. And we
plainly ought to do that.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, the average person that lives to be 65 today has a life
expectancy of 83. So if you knew you were going to live 18 years
and you liked what you were doing or you wanted to go do something
else, and the country needed you and there was a place for you in
the economy, I think you ought to be able to work. So I'd like to
see that done. And at least for the next _ I would say for at least
30 years, there will be a significant gap in the retirement income
of older women and older men, and we ought to just make an
adjustment in the Social Security program to take account of that,
I think.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When you were first elected, you had run on the campaign that
proposed lots of additional spending for a variety of programs to
meet needs. Then your advisers told you about the budget deficit
and how severe that problem was. And some published accounts from
that time indicate that you weren't really happy at all at that
point with sort of the straight-jacket you found yourself in _
reporters saying, we all know Eisenhower Republicans, and things of
that sort.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESIDENT: We have a lot of funny conversations around here.
(Laughter) Well, let me say what happened. When we started _ and
Gene remembers this very well _ when we started in '91 and '92, we
concluded that we wouldn't be credible on deficit reduction unless
we could say we could cut it in half in four years. That was
absolutely the minimum threshold. And we put together a campaign
that I took into New Hampshire based on certain economic
assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out _ I think it was when the August of '92 figure
came out, I believe that it looked like it was a lot worse than we
thought.
</P>
<P>
   And you know, we're in the middle of the campaign and we made
some adjustments, and then later after the election, we found out
that we were even a little worse than we thought still.
</P>
<P>
   So after the election, I was put in the position of deciding _ I
couldn't do all that I had said I would do in the campaign in the
order I said I would do it, or simultaneously. So what we decided
to do was to go for the deficit reduction, because we knew if we
didn't turn the economy around, we would never get to spend the
money, anyway. In other words, you're not going to be able to put
the money into education or health care or anything else if you
don't turn the economy around.
</P>
<P>
   So we went for deficit reduction. We cut some things more than
we thought that we would cut. We eliminated some more programs. We
cut the payroll more quickly than we had originally thought, and we
were still able to dramatically increase our investment in the
education area, but we couldn't do as much in some other areas as I
wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as we kept getting the deficit down, moving toward
balance, and we'd free up more money from other sources, then we _
by the time we got to the Balanced Budget Act of '97, we had the
Congress supporting the Children's Health Insurance Program, the
Republican Congress supported it, the biggest expansion of health
care since Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   So what I had to do was to _ it was tough because we had also
had to take a bigger tax bite than I wanted, including a small but
controversial gas tax in the '93 bill, because we had to get to
$500 billion, or we weren't going to be credible. And it turned out
that there really was more pent-up energy in this economy than even
we could have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Because if you look at what the American people did with those
lower interest rates, the deficit reduction package that we thought
would produce $500 billion, the deficit reduction produced half
again that much, didn't it? A lot, anyway. Around $700 billion,
maybe a little more. And then the Balanced Budget Act produced a
surplus bigger than you thought it would.
</P>
<P>
   All of that indicates that the competitive capacity of the
American economy was greater than anyone had imagined, and that
they made greater use of the availability of capital than we had
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   And so now, we had the ability to continue to invest in
education, in health care, in the environment, getting the crime
rate down.
</P>
<P>
   I think we ought to do that. We can't be imprudent, because
whatever combination _ but the interesting thing, I want _ the
debate between the Democrats and the Republicans this year, I hope,
will be what should the combination of tax cuts and investment
increases be. Where would you spend the money you would spend, how
would you cut the taxes you would cut.
</P>
<P>
   But everybody agrees that we're still going to keep paying this
debt down. That's the best debate for America.
</P>
<P>
   There will still be lots of differences between the candidates
and the parties, there will still be plenty to make choices from,
but the American people at least know we have a consensus, economic
direction, and that will send the right signal to the private
sector and to maximize the chances of our continuing to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what's the risk if a Republican wins the White House with
a big tax-cutting package?
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESIDENT: If the tax cut package is big enough, what will
happen is, you will either basically have to cut investments in
education and health care, maybe even in defense, or start spending
the Social Security surplus, or start running a deficit. And either
of those three choices would, in my judgment, weaken our future,
and it would _ the likeliest thing to do, given the reluctance of
people in public life to aggravate organized groups and to turn
their heads away from legitimate needs, the likeliest thing would
be a slow return to the deficit, which I think in the world we're
living in, would be a bad error.
</P>
<P>
   Got to go? Glad to see you guys.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Any big budget initiatives that you haven't announced yet
that you can tell us about? (Laughter)
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESIDENT: No, I gave you the whole loaf at the State of the
Union, and then some.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has the vice president played a particular role in the
formulation of economic policy?
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESIDENT: He was _ absolutely. I'll give you just two
examples. I can give you many more, but let me just mention _ one,
he was adamantly in favor of the tougher approach on deficit
reduction in late 1992 and early 1993. We were debating this around
the table. He was one of the voices that said, we're going to take
a hit on this, the quicker we do it the quicker we get the economy
turned around, let's go on and do it.
</P>
<P>
   Unambiguous, early, clear. Two, he strongly supported what I did
to help Mexico when the financial crisis threatened the stability
of Latin America and our recovery, when only 15 percent of the
American people thought it was a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   The day we decided to help Mexico, a poll appeared and said,
well, 81 to 15, people said don't do it. And I could just give _
three, obviously, he strongly supported our trade position, and I
think his debate with Ross Perot on television was instrumental in
our passage of NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   And then one other thing I would mention. He's been particularly
active in the high-tech field. He worked on the Telecom Act, which
I think has been very important. It's already been responsible for
hundreds of thousands of jobs _ and a lot of other specific,
so-called Silicon Valley issues.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why hasn't he gotten more credit?
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESIDENT: I don't know. Because he deserves it. I don't
know, because he deserves it. These things that I just said to you
are facts; they're not just my opinion about whatever _ Gene will
tell you, he was a great voice. He said, look, let's get this over
with, we've got to get rid of this deficit, we might as well get it
on now. And he should get credit for it. I think maybe it's because
people don't know, so maybe the more they know, the more credit
he'll get.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Thank you very much.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore held off a stiff
challenge by former Sen. Bill Bradley in the New Hampshire primary
Tuesday night, but his narrow victory seemed to point to a long
contentious fight for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, despite a solid victory in the Iowa caucuses eight days
ago, now faces the critical month of March, when more than half the
party's convention delegates will be elected on the first two
Tuesdays, with a dead serious fight ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In a concession speech Tuesday night, Bradley congratulated Gore
without using the words ``victory'' or ``defeat,'' saying, ``We
have made a remarkable turnaround, but there is still a tough fight
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiming victory in a telephone call to midwestern governors,
Gore said of his rival, ``If he cannot win here, then that's a
devastating blow to him.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We were behind in the polls for 14 weeks, so this is
one where we fought our way back on the strength of the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   One key reason why the fight will be rough is that, according to
a poll of Tuesday's voters, Bradley got a substantial majority from
those who decided in the last few days, when he was most combative.
Those poll results may push him toward confrontations in the weeks
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   After this brief moment of voter participation, the Democratic
campaign will shift back to an inside game, with no caucuses or
primaries for the rest of the month. The fields of competition, as
they were all last year, will once again be fund raising,
organization and message, and each candidate will be able to spend
about $20 million more.
</P>
<P>
   Before the polls closed Tuesday, an upbeat Bradley challenged
Gore to debate him once a week between now and the March primaries.
Previously he had spurned Gore's suggestion of twice-weekly
debates, coupled with a mutual agreement not to use 30-second
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley sent a letter to Gore that said nothing about
commercials but concluded, ``I am certain that these debates will
provide a useful road map to the voters as to where the Democratic
Party will take the country in this new century.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter Eskew, Gore's senior strategist, complained that Bradley
was not proposing ``getting rid of ads,'' adding: ``He has gone
halfway. Maybe he'll go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Eskew said, ``We'll enter discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire contest, for 22 of the 4,339 delegates to the
Democratic National Convention, was never likely to be decisive,
although Gore partisans had hoped that a second straight defeat
would discourage Bradley and his backers. And they had begun to
orchestrate appeals by other Democrats for Bradley to halt negative
and personal campaigning in the interest of party unity.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, who retired from the Senate after three terms in
which he represented New Jersey, had insisted all along that he
would stay through what he called the ``national primary'' next
month, when 1,625 delegates will be chosen on March 7 and another
673 on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   One Bradley supporter, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., predicted early
Tuesday that whatever the New Hampshire result, Bradley would not
withdraw. ``I hope he stays in all the way to the convention,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another former colleague, retired Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., who
often worked across party lines with Bradley, said dryly, ``The
party unity argument would not be a strong one with him.''
</P>
<P>
   A continuing element of Bradley's campaign has been that he is
the Democratic candidate independent of the Democratic president.
About a fifth of the party's voters surveyed by a consortium of
five television networks and The Associated Press as they left
polling places Tuesday said that Gore's ties to President Clinton
were very important to them. Bradley did quite well among those
voters. He also did well with those who had an unfavorable view of
Clinton personally.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did best among groups that Democrats depend on in general
elections, including union members and women. (Gore is popular with
many black voters, but this state has a negligible black
population.)
</P>
<P>
   But the other ingredient of general election victory, support
from independents, favored Bradley. Independents cast about
one-third of the Democratic ballots Tuesday, and Bradley got almost
three-fifths of them. He also did best among voters with graduate
degrees and those 18 to 25 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a third of the Democrats said they wanted a candidate who
would stand up for principle. Bradley got two-thirds of their
votes.
</P>
<P>
   But a slightly smaller group, about one-fifth, said they wanted
a candidate with experience. Almost all of them voted for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate profited from the issue he had emphasized. Those
voters most concerned about the nation's schools preferred Gore;
those troubled about health care went for Bradley.

EPA CALLS FOR CLEANUP IN MONTANA MINING TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIBBY, Mont. - The EPA's first extensive testing for asbestos in
this town in the shadow of a closed vermiculite mine shows
contamination at a level that requires an immediate cleanup, the
agency says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have detected levels of asbestos in the air sampling by the
river where the ore was loaded into rail cars, and around the
export buildings downtown. The levels are high enough where we want
the contaminated material removed as quickly as possible,'' said
Paul Peronard, EPA's on-scene coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   EPA scientists evaluating the findings at the two sites say the
contamination appears to be serious enough to increase the rate of
cancer by one case per 100 people exposed to the asbestos fibers.
More extensive and sophisticated testing will be done by the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   The rail-loading site at the base of the mine shuttled ore
across the Kootenai River by conveyor belts. On one side of the
river there is now a nursery. On the other, land has been cleared
for housing lots.
</P>
<P>
   The export site downtown was used to bag the expanded
vermiculite, called Zonolite, for shipments. One of the four wooden
buildings at the site was used as a research lab, where Zonolite
was used to try to manufacture goods ranging from cattle feed to
cookie dough. Today, the site is a lumber yard and mill.
</P>
<P>
   Peronard met Monday with lawyers from W.R. Grace &AMP; Co., the last
owner of the mine which was closed in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave Grace the option of cleaning up the asbestos or having
EPA do it and bill them,''Peronard said.
</P>
<P>
   Grace's representative in Libby, Alan Stringer, says the company
will do ``whatever is required'' by the EPA to remove the hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Peronard and his EPA emergency response team arrived in this
small northwestern Montana town in November, three days after the
Post-Intelligencer published the first of several articles on the
mine. The newspaper documented that for decades, Grace, previous
mine owner Zonolite Co. and government regulators ignored signs of
rampant asbestos contamination that has killed more than 200 people
and sickened hundreds more.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA has taken scores of samples of soil from roads, gardens
and homes in the town. Seventy-three air samples were also
collected.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three of the air samples showed actinolite or tremolite
asbestos fibers, the on-scene coordinator said. There are clearly
fingerprints of residuals of asbestos left on the town.
</P>
<P>
   Team members from the EPA, the U.S. Public Health Service and
the state of Montana are being extremely cautious in discussing the
specific hazards in the levels of asbestos detected thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to hide anything from these people. They have
a right to know everything that we find. But we need to hammer out
what levels of this particular asbestos are dangerous,'' Peronard
said.
</P>
<P>
   If the asbestos that is killing the people of Libby were a
commercial variety such as chrysotile, which for the most part is
imported from mines in Canada and has been used in products for
decades, the hazards would be well-known.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary form of asbestos at Libby is tremolite, which is
a contaminant of the vermiculite ore. Tremolite has not been
extensively studied, although EPA did two preliminary studies in
the 1980s and early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the medical information we've collected thus far, we're
comfortable that tremolite is a greater risk as a carcinogen then
other asbestos fibers,'' Peronard said.
</P>
<P>
   On both coasts, other EPA regions are also struggling to deal
with tremolite contamination.
</P>
<P>
   In El Dorado, a California county east of Sacramento, rolling
hills filled with tremolite have been stirred up by the sprawling
construction of new homes. About 2,400 miles east, in Sparta, a
small town in northern New Jersey, residents around a stone quarry
and mill are concerned about tremolite spewing up the plant's
smokestacks.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast with the Denver-based EPA team's quick action in
Libby, people living near El Dorado and Sparta have criticized
their regional EPA offices for lack of prompt response.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that there is asbestos in this town and
that's enough for us to get our people involved,'' said Max Dodson,
assistant administrator of EPA's Region 8, in an earlier interview.
``Peronard will decide what actions to take once they determine
what fibers they're dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical workers from the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and
Disease Registry in Atlanta will arrive in Libby this week. They
will assist the EPA team in determining what risks may still remain
in the town.
</P>
<P>
   EPA is carefully examining the structures of the fibers it is
finding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long thin fibers are the ones that have greater toxicity and
that's why EPA is evaluating the fiber lengths very closely,'' said
Dr. Aubrey Miller, a Public Health Service specialist assigned to
the team in Libby.
</P>
<P>
   EPA also completed preliminary air sampling of 35 homes
insulated with Zonolite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-three of the houses came back with no asbestos fibers
at the length we're concerned with,'' Peronard said. ``We're not
telling people that those houses are safe yet, but they are not
heavily contaminated.''
</P>
<P>
   Levels at two of the homes do concern the EPA team.
</P>
<P>
   Miller says there is a slight increased risk of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very small. The levels of asbestos are higher than we'd
find in homes outside of Libby, but we don't want these people to
panic and move out of their houses,'' the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   A town meeting is scheduled for Wednesday night so the EPA and
their medical colleagues can explain what the initial tests found.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very complex to all of us, so we're going to try to
explain it as thoroughly as we can,'' Peronard said.
</P>
<P>
   Another 125 residents have asked the EPA to test their homes and
the agency has already planned to test soil dust and insulation at
hundreds of other sites in and near Libby.
</P>
<P>
   The results of air samples that the agency collected at six
schools in town will be released later this month. Fixed air
monitors will test outdoor air in four locations around town and an
additional monitor will be installed to measure air blowing off the
mine site, six miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people have already died and that's heartbreaking, but
EPA can't do anything about the illnesses that came from past
practices at the mine. Our job is to find out if people are being
exposed to these materials today,'' Peronard said. ``We will do
everything we can to identify the hazard and clean it up.''

COMMENTARY: REBEL WITH A CAUSE

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ John McCain has been on a wild ride. Now he's
going to drag the Republican Party on one.
</P>
<P>
   The party that takes paternalism so seriously it was willing to
anoint the scion just based on his scionosity, must now deal with
the scamp.
</P>
<P>
   It's an ``East of Eden'' moment.
</P>
<P>
   When former President Bush came up to New Hampshire, he called
his son a ``boy'' who would not let the country down.
</P>
<P>
   McCain pounced on the word ``boy.'' ``I fully agree with that,''
he said, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   W. seemed to revert to a jittering teen-ager standing on stage
next to his dad at a country music concert on Saturday. It
underscored John McCain's case: Junior was a nice enough guy, but
did he have the experience to run the country?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone assumes the Bush machine will try to tear John McCain
apart limb by limb. But then, John McCain already survived that
fate far away and long ago. So he's pretty fearless.
</P>
<P>
   He went from being a rebellious son to a rebellious POW to a
rebellious senator. Eighteen months ago at dinner, he mused about
how much of a maverick was too much of a maverick to win the
Republican nomination. He knows, even with his rout here, it's hard
to capture a party whose leaders hate you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to restrain my delusions of grandeur,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His weird schizophrenic existence _ cherished by voters and
reporters in New Hampshire for his directness, loathed by
Republican leaders back in Washington for his directness _ was
illustrated in a funny exchange on his bus on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain turned to his friend, the movie actor turned GOP senator,
Fred Thompson, who had come from the nation's capital to campaign
on the ``Straight Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How are things in the city of Satan?'' McCain asked.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson replied that all was quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Then a reporter asked McCain what sort of reception he would get
if his campaign collapsed and he had to return to the Senate he has
so often stirred up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flowers will be strewn in my path,'' he replied drily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something will be,'' Thompson observed, even more drily.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign was devilish. The senator pointed out Tom
Brokaw to one town hall audience as ``one of the last Trotskyites
... left-wing, Communist, pinkos of the American media.''
</P>
<P>
   He reminisced about an exotic dancer he had once dated, when he
was a single flyer. ``Marie, the flame thrower of Florida,'' he
said. Asked what she was like, he replied, ``She was pretty
volatile,'' and then slapped his knee and laughed, ``Har, har,
har!''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate occasionally used curse words, usually foreign to
campaigns. He called himself a ``wacko'' and ``an old geezer,'' and
his answers often degenerated into jokes. Sometimes his answers
went over a weird edge, as when he teased an Air Force veteran: ``I
tried to get in the Air Force, but my parents were married.''
Complaining it was not ``manly'' of Bush to keep him off the New
York ballot, McCain started to denounce it as Communistic. ``I
spent a portion of my life under that system,'' he said. Then he
stopped and smiled. ``How's that for demagoguery? _ Here, you wanna
see my medals?''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Al Gore and Bush, who dole themselves out sparingly, the
Arizona senator offered a giddy excess of access to the press
contingent he dubbed ``great ferrets of truth.'' There was even a
teen-age reporter from Seventeen magazine, patiently waiting to ask
if McCain preferred Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, the man who loves to yak promised weekly yak
conferences. He also wants to start a dialogue with the Senate, a
la British Question Time.
</P>
<P>
   He was full of blunt answers. Queried about Bill Clinton's
legacy, he shot back: ``I think he'll be remembered as a great
waste. A great talent and a great waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was asked if he had given McCain any tips about
Tennessee, in case he ended up running against the vice president
from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never drink Jack Daniels on an empty stomach,'' Thompson
replied.

<P>
   Rivals.com couldn't have asked for a better showcase for its
mission than Wednesday's national signing day.
</P>
<P>
   Experts acknowledge it. Even the statistics confirm it.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Burton is editor of Rivals100.com, one of nearly 500
fan-based sites networked by Seattle-based Rivals.com. Burton
provided recruiting commentary to ESPN.com and to Fox Sports Net
before joining Rivals.com.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of Rivals.com _ in which hundreds of fan sites for
professional, college and high school athletic teams are linked _
appealed to Burton, who assembles his site in Austin. Burton was
also drawn by the independent discussion and feedback available on
Rivals.com sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a major strength,'' said Burton, whose site plans to be
host for a marathon chat with top recruits and other Rivals.com
recruiting analysts from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team sites on Rivals.com bring together publishers who are
passionate about the universities they cover,'' Burton said.
``That's what makes community-driven sites more popular; people are
able to make them what they want to be.
</P>
<P>
   Since its launch in August, a lot of people have been making
Rivals.com a stop _ a long stop. According to the
Nielsen/NetRatings for December, Rivals.com emerged as the Web's
No. 1 ``stickiest'' sports site _ with ``stickiest'' meaning the
average time the site appears on a screen per visit.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ratings, Rival.com users accessed the site for
an average of 1 hour, 5 minutes and 58 seconds, far longer than
big-media sites ESPN.com (21:18) and CBS SportsLine (12:03).
E-commerce king, E-Bay, was the No. 1 non-sports site with a stay
of 1:42.43.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of Rival.com's popularity in December came during
recruiting periods. That should translate into big numbers for the
January ratings.
</P>
<P>
   It's what founder Jim Heckman had in mind when he created
Rivals.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the new media, the fans want to be in charge of the
information,'' Heckman has been quoted. ``They don't want to go to
ESPN or CBS SportsLine and be told what is news.''
</P>
<P>
   Other sites try the portal technique, specifically About.com,
which pays guides an advertising-based commission to gather sites
of similar interests.
</P>
<P>
   But Heckman, who once authored the University of Washington fans
magazine, tried a different approach. With $30 million in backers
such as Intel and News America Digital Publishing (Fox), Heckman
went after experts who had a made a name for themselves in other
media.
</P>
<P>
   Heckman recruited Burton, who started tracking the business of
finding out where young athletes decide to play sports in 1993 as
editor of The National Recruiting Advisor, which published a
monthly newsletter and produced a 900 telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   Other recruiting experts from across the country joined in.
Earlier this week, Rivals.com bridged a potential information gap
by hiring Maxey Parrish, former Baylor sports information director
and former College Sports Information Director of America
president, as a liaison between the company and sports athletic
departments. Parrish plans to continue working out of his home in
Waco while teaching part time at Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's site is like the others in the Rivals.com community.
Rival.com's technology allows publishers to input information
without having to program or design a site.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ease of navigation and a cookie-cutter look to
Rivals.com, Burton said it all comes back to content.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Rivals.com, you're not getting one side to a story,'' he
said. ``You're getting opinions from hundreds and hundreds of
writers.''
</P>
<P>
   ON-ICE CHAT: ESPN.com and NHL.com plan another first at the NHL
All-Star Game on Sunday when they'll offer users to their sites an
opportunity to chat with players while play is in progress. On Jan.
9, ESPN2 on-air hosts and analysts answered ESPN.com user questions
during the Colorado-Chicago game. More than 10,000 questions were
submitted by more than 17,000 unique users, according to ESPN.com

JOB CUTS BY A FRENCH AUTO-PARTS MAKER SEND SHARES LOWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Investors often reward companies that eliminate jobs and
reorganize themselves to become more efficient. But shareholders in
Valeo SA of France, one of Europe's largest automotive parts
companies, sold heavily Tuesday on news that it would cut 6,000
jobs, or 12 percent of the total, in the next two years, and invest
heavily in Latin America and Eastern Europe to shift its presence
away from economically mature regions like North America and
Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of trading here Tuesday, Valeo shares had fallen 9.9
percent, to 63.05 euros, or $61.34. The job reduction news was part
of the company's announcement of 1999 annual results on Monday,
after the stock market had closed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed at first glance, Valeo's earnings results looked strong.
Profit increased 117 percent in 1999, to 563 million euros, on a 28
percent increase in revenue, to 7.7 billion euros. The company's
chairman and chief executive, Noel Goutard, said Valeo would
increase its dividend, which is paid in July, by 50 percent, to 1.5
euros.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the profit gain was the result of a one-time
increase from the sale of 50 percent of a German clutch maker, LuK
GmbH Operating profit, on the other hand, rose only 14 percent to
$472 million, despite the 28 percent revenue increase.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, problems nagging at Valeo's overall performance
persisted in Latin America, where it generates only 3 percent of
revenue; in parts of the electrical-equipment division, including
the headlights unit; and in research and development, where costs
rose 28 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is seeing a lot of reorganization at the
moment,'' said Jerry Raybold, an analyst with Credit Lyonnais
Securities in London. Valeo, he said, ``is still in the testing
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the measures announced by Goutard, who steps down in May,
are far-reaching.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, which accounts for roughly one-third of
the company's revenue, job cuts involve reorganizing ITT
Automotive, a maker of brake and electrical systems in Auburn
Hills, Mich., which Valeo acquired in 1998 for $1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, Valeo is investing $54 million to upgrade its
electrical-equipment manufacturing. But the major task facing
Goutard's successor, Andre Navarri, 47, a former executive of the
Alstom electronics group, who became Valeo's chief operating
officer last year, will be to push the company into regions of
potential growth, like Asia and Eastern Europe, and to expand
businesses that promise high returns, like electronic systems and
Internet-based distribution systems.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of pushing into Asia got a boost last year, after the
French automaker Renault, a major Valeo customer, acquired a 37
percent stake in the Nissan Motor Co. of Japan. Catching this
upwind, Valeo bought a Japanese engine parts and electronic-systems
specialist, the Unisia Jecs Corp., and the Zexel Corp., a Japanese
manufacturer of fuel-injection and air-conditioning systems.
Goutard has set his sights on a third Japanese acquisition, this
time in the auto-electronics business.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve its goals for new distribution methods, Valeo is
setting up a $97 million investment fund to buy into start-up
companies involved in automotive technology and Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, some analysts think that investors punished Valeo too
severely. Raybold of Credit Lyonnais says he expects the company to
regain some of its value. ``If you're selling now,'' he said,
``you're selling too low.''

PERFECT TACTICS PUT AMERICA ONE BACK IN RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ Although Prada of Italy still maintained
a 3-2 edge entering Wednesday's racing in the five-of-nine-race
Louis Vuitton Cup finals to determine Team New Zealand's challenger
in the America's Cup, Paul Cayard and America One more than
displayed their mettle Tuesday. The Americans never trailed in Race
5, showing strength and confidence under withering pressure, to win
by 34 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   If they hadn't completely tacked away from the tension, the
Americans had at least given Prada something to think about. And if
words alone could guarantee a place in the America's Cup final,
which begins Feb. 19, Cayard sounded as if he planned to be the
skipper lined up against New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the hardest one to win of the four we've got
to win,'' Cayard said after Tuesday's race. ``Tomorrow will be a
good one. We'll get it to 3-3 and then we'll see how the other guys
like the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard, in need of a victory Tuesday after two straight defeats,
took the action to his counterpart, Francesco de Angelis. First,
Cayard tried unsuccessfully to coerce Prada into a prestart foul,
but the umpires waved the green checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   But he was not through. With about a minute to go to the
starting gun, Cayard peeled out beyond the committee boat, but
Prada, in control and right on his tail, had him seemingly pinned
from escape.
</P>
<P>
   Holding port tack and with the seconds ticking, Cayard needed to
flop over to starboard to gain steerage rights and make his move
for the line. He needed, however, to create enough separation to
avoid being called for an infraction for tacking too close.
Cayard's timing was perfect, and he slashed inside of Prada. The
Italians screamed foul _ America One had left no room to spare _
but the umpires judged that it was a clean maneuver. The Americans
slipped behind the committee boat with Prada just astern to take
the start by seven seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It was a perfect start. The Italians' view of the Americans'
stern would not change.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we realized in this series is we haven't quite had the
zip we had in the semifinals,'' Cayard said after the victory.
``We've just been trying to get it back in the groove.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Certainly in the afterguard on America One with that kind of
start, and those shifts that John picked for us on the first beat,
that kind of a lead at the top mark is awesome, so that was good,''
he added, referring to the tactician, John Kostecki.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans sailed a brilliant first leg, hitting each shift
as the southwest wind puffed up to 21 knots, and eventually opening
up a seven-boat-length edge. America One's lead at the top mark was
32 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Prada was conceding nothing. Both boats hoisted conventional
spinnakers as the breeze began to fluctuate, bellowing up and down
from 15 to 19 knots. Now it was the Italians' turn. Showing good
pace off the wind, and finding the better pressure pulsing down the
whitecap-flecked Hauraki Gulf, Prada began to reel back major
chunks of waterborne real estate, rounding the bottom mark a mere
10 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
   Prada immediately tacked to the right, and Cayard had no choice
but to follow to defend his lead. He could not risk having the
Italians find better wind or a favorable shift.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians seemed to be sailing a hair closer to the wind, an
advantage Cayard noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little down for some reason,'' he said. But Kostecki
was on top of his game and ultimately forced Prada past the layline
for the windward mark _ adding a short but critical extra margin to
the distance Prada would have to sail.
</P>
<P>
   Squeezing around the mark, America One held an 18-second lead at
the third mark, with half of the 18.5-mile-long course behind it.
</P>
<P>
   But a pattern was emerging. If America One showed a bit more
speed upwind, it was all Prada when the boats creamed downwind.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in what was the decisive moment of the race, Cayard and
his crew faked a jibe on the fourth leg. And with the wind at an
afternoon high of 22 knots, the Italians picked a bad moment to
make a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   It was a beauty.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of their own jibe, with the pressure from the fresh
puff too much for their overtrimmed sails, the Italians broached _
or turned accidentally broadside into the waves _ and skidded out
of control. When their spinnaker collapsed and sailed skyward in
the midst of the sensational wipeout, America One pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   MAKING WAVES
</P>
<P>
   For Wednesday's race, America One invited STEFFI GRAF to occupy
the 17th person _ or observer _ position.  &QL;

MCCAIN FINDS POWER IN WEAKNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ He started at 3 percent, he always says. Polls
had a 5 percent margin of error. That means he might have been at
minus 2. That one always gets the laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Senator John McCain's candidacy for the Republican
nomination has been defined by its unlikeliness, his scant
organization, his anemic finances. But those weaknesses didn't
stand in the way of his run in New Hampshire. Instead, McCain and
his aides tried to make them his strongest weapons.
</P>
<P>
   And it worked.
</P>
<P>
   His victory celebration at the Nashua Crowne Plaza Tuesday night
was worlds away from those early days: supporters jammed a
ballroom, and the lobby outside. The vast media contingent, onto
the story of the campaign, took up every other available inch of
floorspace. The ravioli and chicken strips disappeared as fast as
harried servers could truck giant vats of them out. A slick
eight-piece band, complete with horns, entertained the revelers.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who had seemed guardedly confident in recent days, was
more subdued when he took the stage Tuesday night, accompanied by
``Anchors Away.'' It was if he had suddenly found himself in a
world he didn't quite recognize. Even if he had known in his heart
he would win, he had always maintained the contest would be close.
Double digits, and high double digits at that, had shocked
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   But there were some of the familiar sights: a person dressed up
in a pig costume, who had appeared at many campaign events this
season, was dancing around in the lobby after the senator gave his
prepared acceptance speech. The pig had been protesting pork barrel
spending, and was a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals. McCain had asked costumed protesters up to the stage at
most of his town hall meetings lately, arguing if they bothered to
get dressed up, he at least owed them a chance to say why.
</P>
<P>
   This pig nodded that it felt it had won a victory Tuesday night.
But there was no room on the stage for the porcine activist this
time. It was far too crowded with celebrating McCain supporters,
and a candidate who suddenly looked less like and underdog, if only
for now.
</P>
<P>
   Former Senator Warren Rudman, one of the few major politicians
in New Hampshire to embrace McCain, likened the senator's campaign
to ``take the government back'' to that of the Minutemen.
</P>
<P>
   He also compared McCain to Ronald Reagan, the patron saint of
the Republican Party, who has often been invoked by the Senator's
rivals. Henceforth, Rudman said, supporters of McCain's ideas would
be called ``McCain Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have discovered the real McCain,'' Rudman concluded.
</P>
<P>
   McCain embraced his underdog status with gusto, folding it into
his advocacy of campaign finance reform, which he hammered at every
opportunity. He said he considered his early weakness in this
campaign further proof of how rare, and serious, a threat his
reform message posed to the federal establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, almost everything that might have seemed an advantage to
Texas Governor George W. Bush under ordinary circumstances _ his
huge campaign coffers, his endorsements by countless elected
officials, his disagreements with McCain over campaign finance
reform and taxes _ was used by McCain to buttress his case. In
return, Bush tried to label McCain as something of a liberal, by
Republican standards, with values too much in harmony with the very
establishment that McCain claimed to deplore.
</P>
<P>
   At McCain's town hall meetings, it was clear that his message
was resonating with voters. His appearances might not have been as
well-attended as Bush's, but those who showed up were clearly
fervent.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, McCain held another town hall meeting in
Peterborough, and more than a thousand people showed up.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't necessarily campaign finance reform, or his stance
on abortion, or his tax cut policy that was drawing supporters to
McCain. It wasn't even his politics in some cases. The senator's
appeal was much more personal in New Hampshire, a fact attested to
by the large crowds that would surge toward him at the end of each
town hall meeting, looking to shake his hand and have him sign
``Faith of My Fathers,'' the story of the naval careers of McCain's
father and grandfather and of his own experiences as a prisoner of
war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Some in his audiences found themselves completely out of tune
with his politics, but that didn't matter, because McCain was the
kind of man who would stand up on stage and say, ``I'm going to
tell you some things you want to hear and I'm going to tell you
some things you don't want to hear, but I'm always going to tell
you the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Democrat,'' said Richard Lippincott, 70, of Deering, at
that last town hall meeting. Lippincott said he favored free,
universal health care and a far bigger role for government in
American life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sound like a socialist,'' he allowed. But he said he would
still vote for McCain, who had been calling himself ``a proud
conservative'' at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here because John McCain makes sense,'' Lippincott said.
``He's more honest and direct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If either one is elected, they'd probably align pretty well
with my beliefs, but I don't see Bush as decisive,'' said Mark
Fiedler, 50, a teacher from North Swanzey who attended a McCain
rally in Keene on Monday. ``I never thought (Bush) wanted to be
president. It's like he was drafted. . . . He doesn't have the same
fire as McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the apparent size of his victory, McCain's aides
took pains to point out that his run for the nomination was still a
long climb up a steep hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are painfully aware that we are running against the
best-funded presidential candidate in all of history,''
spokesperson Todd Harris said. ``But tonight gives us great reason
for optimism, because it proves that the message is more important
than the money and that organization is more important than
inevitability.''
</P>
<P>
   But the money continues to be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign plans a major fundraising push starting
Wednesday Phone banks used to get out the vote Tuesday will be used
to contact supporters who will marshall donors to the senator's
cause. There will be a mass mailing, and appeals from McCain's web
site. On February 10th and 11th, several fundraisers in Washington
DC and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for one night, the struggle faded into the background.
Even the money started to right itself. At about 10 p.m., McCain
spokesman Howard Opinsky came into the press room to tell reporters
that donations to McCain's website had totalled $14,000 in the 90
minutes following his victory.

door, a housesitter, a woman who had expected to welcome home a
handful of excited kids and their mom and dad from a warm weekend,
instead hosted a private wake.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the small circle of family and friends there cared to
talk.
</P>
<P>
   In Burien south of Seattle, where David Clemetson worked in
internal medicine and infectious diseases at the Three Tree
Internal Medicine clinic, staff and patients were dazed and
red-eyed, working while remembering the family they knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``David was a sweetheart of a person. He was someone you could
count on as a friend,''said Paul Baker, a nurse practitioner who
shared an office with Clementson, and considered him a friend and
mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suddenness of their loss makes you appreciate those you
have in your own life, to hug your own family and make sure they
know it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clemetsons each brought children from prior marriages to
their union, and together had a son, Spencer, six months ago. David
Clemetson had daughters, Blake, a first-grader, and Coriander, a
second-grader, and adopted Carolyn's son, Miles, a first-grader.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said the family had lived on the block for about three
years. Carolyn Clemetson, who loved life and people, made it a
point to get to know just about everyone.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor who declined to be named remembered a New Year's
party at the couple's home last month. Carolyn Clemetson had
remarked: ``I love my family so much. The neat thing about the kids
now is they like hanging out with us. They think we're cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor, Effie Cain, recalled the Clemetson girls as
``lively. I could hear those little patent-leather shoes going up
their steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Miles's prize possession was a little scooter he bought by
saving money from small chores, on which he powered himself up and
down the block.
</P>
<P>
   Clemetson's coworkers said he was flying standby to Mexico last
week, and was excited about getting away with his family for a few
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``David just wanted to have a long weekend vacation with his
family, who were his utmost priority,'' said office manager Lynn
Kriedman. ``He had a very active practice in infectious diseases
and primary care.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemetson so adored his family that even the screen saver on his
computer was a photo of his newborn son. Baker said Clemetson cut
back on clinic hours to spend more time with family after Spencer's
birth.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor was born in Saskatchewan and became a U.S. citizen in
1977 when he entered Duke University. He studied medicine at Guy's
Hospital Medical School in London from 1979-1984, taking
post-graduate training at Oxford University and Brown University in
Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   He spent several years studying infectious diseases in Kenya and
New Guinea. From 1989 to 1992 he was a senior fellow at the
University of Washington's infectious diseases training program and
remained on UW's clinical faculty after joining the Highline
hospital in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said Clemetson physician was ``an excellent teacher, he
trusted you. Once he knew you `got it,' and you could show him you
`got it,' he had confidence in you.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the good times Baker recalled were needling Clemetson,
hoping to evoke the doctor's marvelous laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he was trained in England, he had a streak of
properness about him,'' Baker said. ``I used to pull his chain on
that and get him to smile.''
</P>
<P>
   When he put down his doctor's bag after hours, Clemetson put on
a carpenter's belt to work at his hobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He absolutely loved carpentry,'' Baker said. ``He remodeled
his house himself, everything _ walls, floors _ and was always
getting new tools or talking about tools,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said his first thoughts when he learned Clemetson and is
family were on Flight 261 was of Clemetson's smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a wonderful smile. All I thought was that the thing I
will miss most is his smile,'' Baker said quietly _ ``all their
smiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Monte Donaldson and Colleen Whorley
</P>
<P>
   Monte Donaldson had just started work on an a short indie film.
His fiance, Colleen Whorley, had recently earned another promotion
at Microsoft, where she worked as an art director.
</P>
<P>
   They planned a September wedding and a honeymoon to Indonesia
and Ireland. But the young couple's bright plans for the future
went down in the Pacific Ocean Monday when their Alaska Airlines
jet crashed off the California coast. They were young, and very
much in love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like them to be remembered for their degree of
sensitivity,'' said Adam Suhl, 32, a close friend of the couple.
</P>
<P>
   Suhl, along with his girlfriend, Mary Bisceglia, 23, has been
house sitting for Whorley, 34, and Donaldson, 31.
</P>
<P>
   Having attended a family reunion with Whorley's stepfather, John
Sanchez, in Puerto Vallarta, the couple traveled for two more weeks
before returning home to their cottage-like Seattle home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were both lovers of beauty and harmony, and you could
really hear that in Monte's music,'' said Suhl in a hushed voice,
expressing the sadness and shock he's feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Whorley loved photography, he said. One day, he believes, she
would have gone far in that pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson, a freelance DJ who performed as DJ E.E.G _ was known
in local clubs for his ambient mixes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was usually relegated to the chill room,'' Suhl said with a
smile, referring to the mellow tempo of his music. Donaldson also
loved traveling and had a thing for collecting sentimental
memorabilia _ rocks, fortune cookie messages and the like.
</P>
<P>
   He was also unabashedly crazy about Whorley, sending her post
cards from his travels in Asia last winter. In one post card,
mailed from Thailand, Donaldson says he feels ``ecstatic'' when he
think of spending the rest of his life with her.
</P>
<P>
   Bisceglia says that in an e-mail Donaldson sent Suhl from
Mexico, he said that he was falling in love with Whorley for the
10th time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what made them stand out ... it was their love for one
another,'' says Bisceglia, sorting through the photos documenting
the couple's eight-year history.
</P>
<P>
   It was that last trip to Asia that convinced Donaldson to
include Bali, Indonesia, along with Ireland, as part of his
honeymoon plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked what he saw there and he wanted to share that with
her,'' says Suhl.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Suhl and Bisceglia erected a shrine of sorts to honor
their friends in the home the young couple had purchased last year.
</P>
<P>
   It includes photos of the couple, Whorley's favorite hat and
scarf, Donaldson's rock collection and one of his particularly cool
vintage shirts, among other treasured items.
</P>
<P>
   In the photos, Donaldson's darkly handsome features stand in
contrast to Whorley's mop of wild curls and almost dreamy smile
(which seems to appear in most of the dozens of photos stacked and
scattered on the living room floor).
</P>
<P>
   But he was always smiling when he was standing next to her.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney, Sarah, Rachael and Grace Pearson
</P>
<P>
   He was a pillar of of a good many Seattle restaurants over the
years. She was an outgoing Alaska Airlines flight attendant. They
were devoted parents to their two daughters, 6-year-old Rachael and
22-month-old Grace.
</P>
<P>
   For their friends, the loss of Rodney and Sarah Pearson and
their girls is painful almost beyond description.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to get through the day,'' said Tom Church,
president of Six Degrees restaurants in Seattle and suburban
Kirkland. Rodney Pearson was vice president of operations for Six
Degrees, where he was extremely well liked by staff and customers
both, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has hit a lot of people,'' Church said. ``There's been
tears. A lot of managers are on duty today ... because servers with
a lot of history with Rod stayed home.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson, 45, had at least 25 years in the restaurant business,
and worked at many well-known restaurants in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a person in love with the industry,'' Church said. ``He
was hands-on. He met people at the door. He would bus tables. He
didn't put himself above anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But as much as Pearson loved his work, he always set aside
Sundays for his family, Church said. Family always came first, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And if his wife was off flying, he wouldn't hesitate to bring
his daughters into work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would be bouncing them on his knee while he trained
staff,'' Church said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pearsons were on a family vacation, traveling on Alaska
employee passes. It was their first vacation together in some time,
friends said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Mitchelli IV, chef at Trattoria Mitchelli, said he'd
known Pearson since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible thing,'' Mitchelli said. ``We go back a ways,
Rod and me. He had two little girls, and I have a little girl. ...
it's so scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson was loved by those who worked for him, in part because
he was never afraid to pitch in to do whatever needed to be done,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got his hands dirty and busted butt,'' Michelli said. ``He
was the epitome of the team player.''
</P>
<P>
   Bo Bonina, vice president of food and beverages for the Seattle
Athletic Club, opened several restaurants with Pearson in 1993.
They'd been friends since, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very good guy, extremely gregarious. He was a devoted
family man,'' Bonina said. ``And his wife, she was ... outgoing and
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Rod Pearson was also a talented athlete. He loved cycling and
was a former star high school wrestler in Seattle, Bonina said.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Pearson, 36, whose maiden name was Manning, was from
Spokane, he said. Bonina spoke to her father, who was attempting to
cope with the loss of the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a devastating thing to lose a child, as well as
grandchildren and a son-in-law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pearson lived in a tidy clapboard beige-and-white home in
Seattle. Next door at a neighbor's house, a note taped to a wreath
read ``Friends and neighbors come in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be surprised at how important they were to this block,''
said one neighbor at the house who did not give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Bonina said Pearson was so devoted to his wife and daughters, he
could not have borne their loss. He would have wanted to go with
them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If if could have chosen it, this is what he would have
wanted,'' Bonina said.
</P>
<P>
   But for those left behind, it's almost unbearable to lose a
whole family at once, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People die, it happens, but this is so damn unbelievable,''
Bonia said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan and Abigail Busche
</P>
<P>
   On better days, there was truth in the cheerful answering
machine message that promised callers a speedy return call from
``Abby and Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the voice mailbox was full at the young couple's
Seattle home and calls went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan and Abigail Busche meet as art students at Western
Washington University, graduating in 1996. They moved to Seattle
and married in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The couple was hired two years ago to design software and Web
pages for ArtSource Inc., a Bellevue art production and design
company that contracts with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jeff Christensen said he and other ArtSource workers were
shaken by the loss of the well-regarded employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``(This) is a community, and there are lots of folks who know
these people. It's very somber today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Busche, 28, who designed sports games, was a ``soft-spoken,
sweet guy who was good at what he did,'' Christensen said. Abby,
25, a product designer, accepted a full-time job with Microsoft in
October.
</P>
<P>
   In the South Seattle neighborhood where the couple settled 18
months ago, news of their deaths struck a personal chord.
</P>
<P>
   Yuriko Ued, who lives across the street, gazed at the Busches'
red Volkswagen station wagon parked in the driveway, and expressed
regret at not having gotten to know the couple better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't speak, we just waved _ that kind of a greeting,''
she said. ``It's too sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom and Peggy Stockley
</P>
<P>
   Tom Stockley was a big deal among wine growers, wine dealers and
those who simply liked to wet their whistles. But what triggered
that affection wasn't just the stuff he wrote, or the kudos he
awarded a particular vintage.
</P>
<P>
   They just loved the guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wine writers as a breed can have a. . . well, a kind of
arrogance about themselves,'' said Joe Algeo, national sales
manager for Arbor Crest Wine Cellars in Spokane. ``Tom never
displayed that, ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Algeo's appraisal was just a taste of what others had to say
about Stockley, 63, wine columnist for the Seattle Times, and his
wife of 40 years, Peggy, 62.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always considered them guiding lights,'' said Jeri
Callahan, a neighbor at the Lake Union houseboat moorage where the
Stockleys' lived in Seattle. The couple holed up there 20 years ago
after raising two children in Bellevue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been the glue that's held this place together,''
Callahan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stockleys and Callahan met in Puerto Vallarta for dinner the
weekend before last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not like them at all,'' she said. ``They had splurged on a
fancy hotel on the beach. Tom said that was OK because they
wouldn't have to buy the wine. He'd brought his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockley's advice on wine was cited widely. It was used in
stores operated by the State Liquor Control Board as well as by
such retail outlets as Larry's Market.
</P>
<P>
   At Pete's, a special neighborhood grocery with a wide wine
selection, owner George Kingen expressed shock at the crash news.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were friends,'' he said. ``We'd have dinner together at
least a couple of times a year. In fact, we'd just had them over to
the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Times food editor Sharon Lane spoke of Tom Stockley's common
touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about him, he wasn't a wine snob,'' she said. ``If
you were having a dinner party and wanted to know what wine to
serve, you could call him up even at his home, and he'd make a few
suggestions. He wrote for the average person and he was just so
nice to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockley followed the wine beat under a special contract with
his newspaper after retiring as the Sunday magazine's assistant
editor 10 years ago. He broke into the newspaper business at the
Bremerton Sun, and joined the Times in 1967. As a wine writer, he
literally ``grew up with the Washington wine industry,'' said Steve
Burns, executive director of the Washington Wine Commission in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he started writing about wine more than 20 years ago, we
had 15 wineries. Today there are more than 150.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said news that Stockley was killed in the crash stunned
wine people around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been getting calls from all over,'' he said. ``One came
from a writer in London who said `tell me it's not true.' Then Gary
Hogue of Hogue Cellars called from Copenhagen. He wanted to know if
he should come home.''
</P>
<P>
   But the wine writer wasn't the only Stockley star.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy's light shined as brightly, in other circles.
</P>
<P>
   Like her husband, she graduated in journalism from the
University of Washington. She then worked briefly for the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   On Lake Union, she held the houseboat community together as
secretary of the Floating Homes Association, and has helped a
variety of social-service agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The couple is survived by daughters Paige Stockley, a
professional cellist, and Dina Stockley Moreno, who is married with
a 21-month-old daughter, Luisa, and Peggy's 93-year-old mother,
Margaret Hodges, all of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Hodges learned of her daughter's death, she had been
rummaging through a chest of drawers and discovered a small yellow
Post-It note tucked in a corner. It said, ``I love you,'' and was
signed, ``Peggy.''
</P>
<P>
   Meghann Hall, Ryan Sparks, Rachel Janosik
</P>
<P>
   The ties that come with small-town life bound Meghann Hall, Ryan
Sparks and Rachel Janosik tightly.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they grew into young adults in Enumclaw, Wash., in the
shadow of the Cascades, learned English and biology at Enumclaw
High and played for the honor of their school on athletic fields
and in the gym.
</P>
<P>
   They had graduated from the school and moved on. But small towns
don't forget their own. News of Monday's plane crash triggered a
wave of grieving.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some kids who are pretty shook up here today,'' said
Rick Ofstrand, a counselor and basketball coach at the high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad night in Enumclaw tonight,'' added Josh Ladda, a
friend of Hall's.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, 19, was an ace pitcher on the school softball team.
Janosik, 20, played on the same team, said her grandfather, Philip
Janosik.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, 20, was Hall's boyfriend. Basketball was his sport,
though a knee injury his senior year kept him from playing much.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ofstrand had no problem remembering a young man who
graduated three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a great kid, a real mature kid,'' Ofstrand said.
``He was a real leader here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks had been working full-time in a box factory.
</P>
<P>
   Hall was one of the best pitchers in the state and won an
athletic scholarship to Highline Community College. She worked at
Bed, Bath &AMP; Beyond at the Auburn Supermall.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was an incredible person,'' Ladda said. ``Meghann was very
outgoing, quick-witted, entertaining and intelligent. ... She had a
way of singling out one aspect of a person and never forgetting, no
matter how many people she knew or touched. She always
remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   Her death marked the second time her family lost a child. A
brother died in a motorcycle accident four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Janosik had moved to Bellevue, where she attended community
college and played sports, her grandfather said. Last August, she
got a job with Horizon Air. She would stock planes with food and
beverages before they left Sea-Tac International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was happy as a lark there. She was just tickled to death
to have a full-time job,'' Philip Janosik said.
</P>
<P>
   A side benefit of airline work was flying for free. It was
perfect for Janosik.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was her fourth or fifth trip on passes,'' Philip Janosik
said. ``She had been to Mexico a bunch. She really liked it down
there.''
</P>
<P>
   She decided to go to Puerto Vallarta again, and she took her old
friends from Enumclaw with her for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy passes'' is what Ofstrand, the high school counselor,
called them.
</P>
<P>
   Don Shaw
</P>
<P>
   Don Shaw was on his way back from a househunting trip in Mexico.
For years, the 63-year-old Shelton, Wash., man and his wife had
traveled to Mexico on vacations. Now, a few years after his
retirement, it was time to find a place on the beach to call their
own.
</P>
<P>
   But his wife, Earlene, had a new business and some commitments.
So Don Shaw, the former principal of four elementary schools in the
Snohomish School District, traveled alone on Alaska Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only imagine what she's going through right now,'' said
Nancy Whitson, a longtime friend and a principal at Totem Lake
Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   Before becoming principal, Don Shaw was an elementary-school
teacher and librarian in Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to the Snohomish School District in 1976,'' Whitson
said, ``and Don was on my interview committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were running a little late and he came out and _ as he
would do so many times _ put his hand on my shoulder and said,
`Don't worry.'''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw retired in 1991, and he and his wife moved to Shelton. He
volunteered as a tour guide at the state Capitol; Earlene worked in
the Capitol cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's friends paint a picture of a man committed to his job and
his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``His love for his jobs and the kids were unparalleled,
certainly that I've ever seen,'' said Rod Vroman, a longtime
principal in the district and a good friend. ``If you ever wanted
to meet a kind, gentle man, Don was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert and Lorna Thorgrimson
</P>
<P>
   Retiree Robert Thorgrimson and his wife, Lorna, a department
store saleswoman, lived in Poulsbo, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thorgrimson, 63, was the grandson of a founding partner
in the Preston, Gates &AMP; Ellis law firm based in Seattle. He is
survived by an adult son and daughter, and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The Thorgrimsons, described by neighbors and relatives as
private and reserved, were eager to leave behind the winter gloom
of the Northwest for a Mexican getaway. Lorna Thorgrimson, 53, sold
furniture at the Silverdale Bon Marche.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they were quite excited about going on vacation for two
weeks in Puerto Vallarta,'' said longtime neighbor Ruth Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, relatives descended on the couple's rambling
seven-bedroom home off Hood Canal.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Wall, 96, who has lived down the street from the family
for more than 20 years, recalled happier homecomings. ``I remember
when a bunch of college students would be at the house,'' Wall
said. ``There were so many boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorgrimson's father, Richard, built the waterfront property as
a summer home in 1973, while a law partner in Preston, Thorgrimson,
Shidler, Gates &AMP; Lucas, a firm his father helped found. On his
death, the home passed to Robert and his two younger brothers, now
deceased.
</P>
<P>
   Margery Thorgrimson, who was married to Robert for 23 years,
said her former husband was fond of skiing, golf and gardening.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is tough for the kids,'' she said. ``But I'll be with
them over the next few days. They'll be just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison Shanks
</P>
<P>
   Allison Shanks adored her 4-year-old daughter Haile, frequently
rollerbladed around Seattle's Green Lake with her and showered the
child with clothes. She tried to work only on weekends as a flight
attendant so family members could care for Haile while she was
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was an incredible woman, an incredible mother,'' said
Shanks' sister-in-law, Jamie Shanks. ``She loved her job, loved to
travel, loved the camaraderie of being a senior flight attendant.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison Shanks, 33, joined Alaska in December 1988. On a layover
in Mexico, she met a man who would become her husband. They lived
in Los Angeles, but divorced when Haile was only three months old,
Jamie Shanks said.
</P>
<P>
   Mother and daughter moved back to Seattle, living in Issaquah
with Allison's mother, Dolores.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were best friends,'' Shanks said.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Allison and Haile moved to a three-story
condominium across from Seattle's Woodland Park Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   When Allison flew on weekends, Haile would stay with her
grandparents or other relatives. But she loved her mother best.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days that Allison was coming home, Haile was always on
Cloud 9,'' Shanks said.
</P>
<P>
   Avinesh Amit Deo, Avinash ``A.V.'' Prasad and Anjesh Prasad
</P>
<P>
   AvineshAmit Deo, 23, was scheduled to start his first day on the
first job of his first real career Tuesday. Deo, who graduated in
December from ITT Technical Institute, and two cousins,
Avinash``A.V.'' Prasad, 19, and Anjesh Prasad, 19, left Friday for
Puerto Vallarta to celebrate Deo's graduation and the launch of his
new career in computer-aided drafting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so excited about it,'' said Laura Nielsen, director of
career services at ITT, who helped Deo secure his job at All Pro
Power Washing and Coatings in Ballard.
</P>
<P>
   Deo was to begin as an ``estimator'' doing computer-aided
estimates of large construction projects, said Tony Salazar,
general manager of All Pro, who hired him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just shined,'' said Salazar, who was still choking back
tears Tuesday after speaking with Deo's mother. ``He had so much
talent and enthusiasm. He would have become a very fine estimator,
something the industry needs desperately.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family struggled with the shock Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy (Deo) was the only person I ever knew who could bring
a smile to anyone's face,'' said David Shimek, friend of Deo's and
his co-worker at Big 5 Sporting Goods in Burien. ``He knew how to
handle situations, no matter what they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Salazar wanted Deo to start work earlier, but Deo insisted on
giving Big 5 two weeks' notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really struck me,'' Salazar said. ``He was devoted to his
word as an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Deo and his cousins were close, said friends and family members.
All were born in Fiji. Deo's family immigrated in 1995, while
Anjesh Prasad has lived in the U.S. since he was 17 months old.
Avinash Prasad, an only child, moved here with his parents at age
18. The vacation was his first trip away from home.
</P>
<P>
   Avinash Prasad was mourned Tuesday by his co-workers at the
Renton warehouse of HomeGrocer.com where he worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``His nickname was the `Fiji Flash' for his speed on the company
soccer team, said Rick Lessley, director of operations for the
company. Prasad, who had worked for HomeGrocer since October,
scored goals in each of the company's three games so far this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very good-natured with a great sense of humor and a
very strong work ethic,'' Lessley said. ``It's a sad day.
HomeGrocer lost such a fine employee and member of our family.''
</P>
<P>
   Prasad's peers had a moment of silence when they were informed
of the crash Tuesday morning, Lessley said. The company plans to
make counselors available to employees in the wake of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Prasad's cousin, Anjesh Prasad, also loved sports. Anjesh
Prasad, who graduated from Highline High School in 1998, worked for
Horizon Air as a ground service agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three of them were very athletic,'' said Robby Armijo, a
friend of Anjesh Prasad and Deo.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond their athleticism, the young men were known for their
ability to make people smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anjesh was very funny, very bright,'' Armijo said. ``The whole
family are just fine people.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Penna
</P>
<P>
   Allen Temple lost six friends to the Pacific Ocean on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-eyed, brown-haired Deborah Penna, an Cornish College art
student known for her abstract paintings and quiet, thoughtful way,
was among them.
</P>
<P>
   So were Michael Bernard, Ryan Busche, Abigail Busche, James Ryan
and Russell Ing.
</P>
<P>
   Temple met Penna, 27, nine years ago in Chicago, where she
attended school. When Temple moved to Bellingham, she introduced
him around.
</P>
<P>
   Many of their shared friends perished in the Alaska Airlines
flight 216 crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of my crew is basically in the ocean right now,'' said
Temple, 28, a student at Bellingham Technical College who gathered
with friends Tuesday night to sort out their grief.
</P>
<P>
   Of his six friends aboard the flight, Temple knew Penna the
longest. Her paintings, including a portrait of her boyfriend
Charles, hang in Temple's Bellingham home.
</P>
<P>
   ``She expressed herself through her art,'' said Temple. ``Debbie
was a pretty soft-spoken person but when she did speak she had a
lot to say in a few words. A lot of times she would sit by the
wayside and absorb.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple said he had talked to Penna shortly before her trip to
Mexico, a vacation planned in a celebration of a James Ryan's
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very excited to hang out in another country,'' said
Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Part of her trip included a visit with her boyfriend, Charles
McHale, a University of Washington student working in Mexico on a
building project for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Penna attended art schools in Chicago and New York before
enrolling at Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle. A multi-media
artist, Penna used a variety of materials in her work, from crayon
to hair to plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Painting was her first love,'' said Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Penna expected to graduate in May, said Monica Moe, director of
public relations for Cornish College. Moe called Penna's death
``devastating for a small community like Cornish,'' which currently
enrolls 625 students.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions on a memorial and scholarship for Penna are pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was delightful. Everybody loved Debbie,'' said Diane
Brainard, the owner of Old Town Cafe in Bellingham, where Penna
waitressed three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Brainard recalled how Penna took pains to create the ``please
have a seat sign'' for restaurant customers.
</P>
<P>
   Temple said he is still coming to terms with Penna's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have waves of not believing this happened,'' he said. ``She
was a beautiful person, inside and out.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford Poll
</P>
<P>
   Stanford Poll was a large, loud, robust man who once owned the
J&AMP;M Cafe and Blue Moon tavern in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He swam naked in his pool every morning, blasting jazz and blues
loud enough to startle the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   He talked constantly, chortled like Santa Claus and called his
tanning habit ``going to war with the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He filled up the whole room and when people saw him, they
didn't know if they should fear him or love him,'' said his
daughter, Shaina Poll.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, the 59-year-old Mercer Island man doted on his four
children and his wife, Gabriel. He also ``adopted'' friends and
co-workers into his large extended family, and loved teasing them
with his generous wit.
</P>
<P>
   A passionate fisherman who plied the Alaskan waters, he took his
daughters fishing while they were still in diapers, wrapping Wonder
Bread bags around their feet for waders.
</P>
<P>
   He poured half-and-half in his kids' cereal for a special treat.
And he was so persistently late that his wife finally gave up,
setting back their clocks by two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a small boy in a very, very big body,'' said Sasha
Poll, another daughter. ``We called him Peter Pan.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Shaina: ``He could take anything in life and enjoy it, and
he showed you how to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   He never finished college, but excelled in business, owning a
fashion school, pizza parlor, video arcade and other bars. In the
'70s, while running the J&AMP;M on First Avenue, he helped launch the
restoration of Pioneer Square.
</P>
<P>
   At the J&AMP;M, he wooed his future wife, then a cocktail waitress.
</P>
<P>
   He loved Mexico and wanted to retire near its sparkling blue
water. He took his family to Puerto Vallarta every spring, but this
time, he went alone to relax for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Poll was supposed to come home Wednesday, but he missed his wife
so much he hopped on an early flight.

STEVENSON: HE WAS AN INTELLECTUAL WHEN US WANTED A HERO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A &UR;  &LR; few days after the 1984 presidential election, America's
leading comic artist mixed prophecy and nostalgia. In
``Doonesbury,'' Garry Trudeau depicted Rick Redfern, a reporter,
asking his wife, Joanie Caucus, ``What if one day my kid wakes up
in a country run by Newt Gingrich?'' Joanie is puzzled. Gingrich, a
decade before becoming House speaker, was still a backbencher.
``Joanie,'' Rick anxiously implores, ``If something happens to me,
you must tell our son about Adlai Stevenson!''
</P>
<P>
   OK, Rick. He was a gentleman farmer, a patrician with common
sense, who credibly accepted the Democratic presidential nomination
in 1952 saying, ``Let's talk sense to the American people. Let's
tell them the truth, that there are no gains without pains.''
</P>
<P>
   Adlai Ewing Stevenson, born 100 years ago Saturday, was admired
by ``eggheads,'' a phrase coined by columnists Joseph and Stewart
Alsop, but also by millions of others. Reverend Pierre Teilhard de
Chardin, the Jesuit scientist-philosopher, wrote from New York
after the 1952 election, ``Like many others, I shed a tear for
Stevenson. But the masses wanted a hero, a wonder-working savior.''
Dwight Eisenhower, a former general, trounced Stevenson in 1952 and
in a 1956 rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Today, both parties treat vanquished nominees like Kleenex. But
in the 1950s, citizens bought bound volumes of Stevenson's
speeches. Clif Keane, a crusty sportswriter who could empty a
dugout with razor-sharp scorn, kept a copy in his desk drawer.
Waving at it police reporters, he said ``You guys, while you're
waiting around for some guy to fricassee his spouse, should read
some real eloquence by a real gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Another great reporter, Murray Kempton, wrote that in the 1952
campaign, Stevenson ``has been forced through every assault upon
his own sense of genteel conduct . . . he has suffered the slights
of purists like myself who undoubtedly would have knocked
Lincoln.'' Of the 1952 results, Kempton wrote, ``the knuckleheads
have beaten the eggheads.'' Stevenson himself responded by saying
``Eggheads of the world, unite; you have nothing to lose but your
yolks.''
</P>
<P>
   Educated at Choate and Princeton, he flunked out of Harvard Law
School and finished at Northwestern. Erudition shimmered in his
speeches. ``I ask your support, not in the name of complacency but
in the name of anxiety,'' he said in 1956. ``I don't know whether
that is the way to win at politics. But it is the only way I want
to win.'' The former Illinois governor shared with Abraham Lincoln
a sense of humor and an insistence on writing his own speeches.
These orations thrilled intellectuals, but as Mary McGrory wrote,
``They cost him dear. His agony in preparing them is the primary
source of the charge of indecisiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1950s, Democrats were drifting toward John F.
Kennedy, seldom charged with indecisiveness. Stevenson's last
hurrah was at the Democratic National Convention in 1960, where the
most memorable speech was not his but that of Eugene J. McCarthy of
Minnesota nominating him: ``Do not leave this prophet without honor
in his own party. Do not reject this man.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy recalled the other day that ``Adlai was a 19th century
orator. He was a master of the balanced sentence, but he left
behind people who can't handle the balanced sentence. And no one
was going to beat Ike.'' (His own effort, McCarthy casually
dismissed as a convention rite: ``When you nominate someone for
president, you nominate yourself, like Jack (Kennedy) for Adlai in
'56 and Clinton for (Michael) Dukakis in '88.'')
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, five years after JFK named Stevenson ambassador to the
United Nations, he collapsed and died on a London street. His
legacy was a stubborn urge to ``talk sense'' in the 1950s, a smug
and sleepy time. ``Man is a strange animal,'' Adlai Stevenson once
said. ``He doesn't like to read the handwriting on the wall until
his back is up against it.''

SPORTS COLUMN: VERMEIL OPTS TO GO OUT A WINNER
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems like it was only yesterday _ actually, it was two days
ago _ when Dick Vermeil was still the coach of the Super Bowl
champion St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   He was operating on no sleep, gearing up for the flight home and
the giddiness of the victory parade, but there was also the feeling
of a relatively sane 63-year-old man taking a last look around.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody who knew Vermeil when he was a crazed middle-aged coach
asked him if he had ever fulfilled his dream of going back to his
ancestral home in France. Vermeil replied that he might do it,
since his wife had taken French lessons. He sounded like a man who
was about to get a life.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else do you have to prove?'' asked his wife of 44 years,
Carol Vermeil. It was a good point, even with nearly $4 million
left in the final two years of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, with the roar of the Super Bowl still in his ears, Dick
Vermeil announced he was leaving the Rams. It was better than
getting fired, which had been an option going into this past
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many coaches can say they went out as world champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about it,'' Vermeil said, with a characteristic
sob.
</P>
<P>
   There is something to be said for quitting on top. John Wooden
won his 10th college basketball title in 12 years with UCLA in 1975
and he retired. Red Auerbach won his ninth title with the Boston
Celtics in 1966 before turning the team over to Bill Russell, who
had something to do with all nine, to be sure. And Vince Lombardi
won three straight championships, including two that were
retroactively labeled Super Bowls, before retiring from the Green
Bay Packers in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   None cited burnout, as Vermeil did when he left the Philadelphia
Eagles in 1983. They had just done it long enough.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes coaches come back. Lombardi tried it again with the
Washington Redskins until cancer cut him down. Phil Jackson, who
retired along with Jordan after the 1998 championship, is back in
Los Angeles after a mind-clearing sabbatical.
</P>
<P>
   But Vermeil does not expect to be back.
</P>
<P>
   He confessed that in some ways the game had passed him by. After
winning only nine games in his first two years with the Rams, he
was literally forced to hire an offensive coordinator, Mike Martz,
who now replaces him.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes also retire near the peak of their game. Just the other
day in Atlanta, three men who could still be making respective tons
of money announced the formation of some new company. John Elway
had won two Super Bowls and retired. Michael Jordan had made a jump
shot to win the National Basketball Association championship. And
Wayne Gretzky still had the touch if not the statistics in his last
years with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the great ones quit on top. Jim Brown led the league in
rushing and limped off the field for good. He said he had done
everything he wanted and could make as much money in action movies
as getting whacked by linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams, after coming back from injuries and military
hitches, hit a homer into the gale in Fenway Park and never even
bothered to come down to Yankee Stadium for the final weekend of
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Koufax was a great pitcher in 1966 but he quit because he
didn't want his arthritic left arm to fall off. Jackie Robinson was
aging rapidly, but he chose to quit as a Brooklyn Dodger rather
than accept a trade to the hated New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Three tennis players named Chris, Martina and Steffi all quit
near the top because being a quarterfinalist was just not in their
self-images. And Secretariat won the Triple Crown and retired,
although not by his choice, to the breeding shed, at which he was
spectacularly ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky Marciano, as frugal as he was, retired undefeated as a
championship boxer. The unappealing alternative was Joe Frazier,
battered in a gift draw with one Jumbo Cummings, and Muhammad Ali,
barely able to shuffle, bombarded by Trevor Berbick in their last
fights.
</P>
<P>
   There is no law against a .300 hitter dwindling down to a .250
hitter _ not at outrageous seven-digit salaries. But timely
retirements have a certain mystique to them.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Brown still looks as if he could get you a first down,
inside the tackles, anyway. And Michael Jordan, who retired once
already, is currently the best player in the Washington Wizard
scrimmages. Don't hold Michael to anything, but Dick Vermeil
sounded as if he meant it.

THE BIG LOSER WAS CLINTONISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Clinton wasn't on the ballot, but he lost big all the same.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, New Hampshire Democrats fell for Clinton's denial of
the affair he had conspired with Gennifer Flowers to cover up and
rescued his campaign with a strong second-place finish in the
primary. They kept Clinton alive, and we all know what followed _
corruption, scandals, obstruction of justice, impeachment. But
Tuesday, the Democrats redeemed themselves. After his big win in
Iowa and Clinton's lavish praise in the State of the Union address,
Al Gore was riding high. He expected New Hampshire to send him into
overdrive. Instead it sent him sprawling.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Bill Bradley thought before last week, he knows now
that there is no running a kinder, gentler campaign for president.
Especially not against Al Gore, who once described his political
M.O. as ``rip(ping) the lungs out of anybody who's in the race.''
Gore and his people were nasty these last few days _ when Senator
Bob Kerrey, a Medal of Honor recipient who lost a leg in Vietnam,
showed up to campaign for Bradley, Gore's goons splattered mud at
him and taunted him with ``Cripple!'' They will grow nastier still.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley won't stoop to their level, and perhaps that will spell
his ultimate defeat. But if he keeps asking the question that he
should have raised from the start _ ``How can we believe that you
will tell the truth as president if you won't tell the truth as a
candidate?'' _ he will help voters stay focused on the real stakes
in this election: More Clintonism vs. something cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the stakes on the Republican side, too. John McCain
won big not because New Hampshire swooned for his campaign finance
``reform,'' but because it loved the idea of voting for someone who
seems to be everything Clinton/Gore are not: honorable, principled,
incorruptible. Then again, it didn't hurt that McCain spent far
more time in the Granite State than any other candidate _ 65 days
since last March. That's an advantage he won't have in South
Carolina, the next battleground.
</P>
<P>
   There has only ever been one argument for George W. Bush's
campaign: his electability. Tuesday that electability took a blow
to the solar plexus. Bush is still the favorite _ the GOP
establishment is behind him and he has $35 million in the bank. One
more such loss, though, and all bets are off.

IT'S TIME TO PASS THE SWORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Hampshire, so tiny, so unrepresentative of America, yet so
critical in determining which boring white man shall lead us all,
has once again lowered its sword of Damocles.
</P>
<P>
   From this point on, the rest of the states, far larger and far
more representative of the modern United States, play only
segmented roles. If New Hampshire wielded a sword, the rest of the
states hold pocket knives. For a more true democracy, the sword
must be passed to another state.
</P>
<P>
   In an America that means what it says about diversity, this
should be the last time New Hampshire holds the first primary. New
Hampshire is beautiful, with lots of beautiful people. But for the
sake of picking a president, it is too antiseptic.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, the candidates debated only a fraction of our
pressing issues. That is a natural consequence in a state that is
98 percent white and has the nation's lowest level of poverty and
eighth-highest percentage of college graduates. Such bliss made it
comfortable for the candidates to ignore public schools, wealth
gaps, the working poor, urban blight, immigration, AIDS, sports
stadiums, and _ oh, yes _ race relations.
</P>
<P>
   The first primary should have the personal touch of New
Hampshire. But it does not have to be New Hampshire. It's not like
they travel in covered wagons any more. You could split the first
two primaries between the highest voting state as a civic reward
(which actually is Maine) and a large, diverse state such as
California, Texas, Florida, New York, or Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   As it is now, Iowa and New Hampshire, less than 1 percent of the
American people, cook the meal the rest of us must eat. That might
be fine if everyone at the dinner table looked like Ward and June
Cleaver. But America is now a banquet hall with tables filled with
Garcias and Wongs, with tables filled with people who send their
children to terrible public schools, with tables filled with people
with social and economic anxieties despite the boom.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates who can digest and address the full plate of America
would surely be more dynamic than the white bread we have now.
Until we find a way to let a state that is representative of
America have first crack at the cutting board, democracy has not
been served. Until the sword is passed to them, New Hampshire
represents a tyranny of the minority.

A NEW WAVE TO RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In politics, as in life, there is a wave _ a force that grabs
you and carries you farther than you ever thought you could go. To
catch the wave, you have to be tucked up tight in the curl, doing
everything exactly right at a very precise moment in time. Arizona
Senator John McCain just caught it in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Every presidential election surges forward on a different wave.
In 1992, it was the economy. In 2000, it is conviction and
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of both _ not a lack of morality _ turned Americans off
to Bill Clinton. And if Clinton is perceived as overly political,
poll-driven, and calculating, so is Vice President Al Gore. The
fear is, so is Texas Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The political establishment insists McCain can't win the
Republican nomination: Bush has the money, the network, and Dad.
But in New Hampshire, McCain and former Senator Bill Bradley had
something more _ people who are tired of the political
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of reporters followed the candidates around New
Hampshire. I was not one of them. I watched the primary like most
Americans _ catching snippets of TV news and parts of some debates,
whenever I could make the switch from Nick at Nite to politics at
night.
</P>
<P>
   From that vantage point, the Granite State had little power. Its
snowcapped peaks and quaint traditions could not seduce me into
accepting the conventional wisdom about ``traction,''
``electability,'' and ``inevitability.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the pundits said, Gore seemed no different in
khakis or jeans than he did in a suit. With Bush, the main
impression continues to be of a man alternating between a wink and
a squint, as he struggles to remember his homework assignment.
Bradley is a tad self-righteous for my tastes.
</P>
<P>
   I don't agree with McCain on abortion. I was disappointed when
he played politics as usual with the Confederate flag. In short, I
don't know if I could actually vote for him as president. But so
far, I like him as a person, which is more than I can say about the
rest of the field.
</P>
<P>
   And I also know what I don't like _ the feeling that an election
is over before it begins, after only two states speak.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the wave changes that.

THE BIG SHOCKER FOR BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; MANCHESTER, N.H. &UR;  &LR; _ A top adviser to Arizona Senator John
McCain had a one-word description for his boss's shocking
obliteration of George W. Bush's New Hampshire campaign tUESDAY
night: iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   It's cute, but the McCain campaign has already been much more
than a large piece of ice, just as the Bush campaign has already
been much more than a lumbering ocean liner.
</P>
<P>
   The major shock to Bush was that McCain appears to have whipped
him within a rather normal Republican electorate. Everyone assumed
that the campaign finance reformer and the most famous passenger on
the Straight Talk Express would take off like a rocket among the
large chunk of independent voters who showed up Tuesday. And he
did. But that wasn't anything close to the whole story.
</P>
<P>
   What also stunned the Bushies was that McCain beat them among
normal, loyal Republican voters, including conservative ones, and
was as strong among men as among women and across all income groups
and education levels. What that means is that as the campaign gets
set for the South Carolina primary on Feb. 19 and the one in
Michigan three days later, the Bush people have no easy target to
shoot at.
</P>
<P>
   At least in New Hampshire, they also do not appear to have much
firepower from the issue they thought two months ago would seal the
governor's victory _ his advocacy of a $1.4 trillion-or-so tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's returns, twice as many voters (nearly 30 percent)
said they believe the advocacy of strong moral values is more
important than taxes as a voting issue. And taxes had to compete
with making Social Security secure for the voters' priority list.
</P>
<P>
   That means, worried Bush advisers agreed, that they will have to
go after McCain the man, not McCain the advocate of a more sensible
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Since they obviously can't assault the character of a man with
McCain's past, that appears to mean that the argument henceforth
will be that he is not a ``real'' Republican. They will argue that
more than a near-clone of Al Gore and Bill Clinton in his ideas,
McCain is unfaithful to Republican principles.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't sound like desperation yet, but John McCain has
shaken the Bush campaign to its smug and lavish foundation.

THE NIGHT BELONGS TO MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; MANCHESTER, N.H. _ John McCain, take a bow. Take two bows.
</P>
<P>
   Because you took about everything else. And gave Texas Governor
George W. Bush a shellacking so thorough that he left town a
whittled-down and sorely whipped frontrunner, propped up by
handlers and endorsers worrying bigtime about their man's stomach,
chin, and heart.
</P>
<P>
   It is still hard to envision McCain capturing the GOP
nomination; his gut-busting assault on Big Money and the corruption
of business-as-usual in Washington terrifies Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott and the business lobbyists who control the GOP's
Washington apparatus. McCain's huge win enters the pantheon of New
Hampshire verdicts past. It ratifies New Hampshire's status as the
primary primary; nowhere else can a distant underdog grab the
frontrunner by the lapels and rattle his dental work.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic race ended like a bar brawl spilling into the
parking lot. Bill Bradley's practice of
politics-as-a-higher-calling collapsed along with his poll numbers
till he morphed into Stone Cold Bill Bradley, Destroyer of
Reputations. Bradley's raw and rugged attacks on Al Gore lacerated
the VP's hide.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens to Bradley down the primary road, his
bitter taunts will live on in the fall as staples of GOP attack
ads. Prominent Democrats, sniffing Bush's vulnerability in
November, realize they have a leak in their own boat. Bradley's
tattoo of Gore will get worse before it gets better, and the
improving odds of Democrats recapturing the US House will suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. High-Minded New Politics resuscitated his New Hampshire
campaign by turning to the kind of slash-and-gash style he
professed to eschew. Bill Bradley as The Undertaker chills the
projections of Democratic office-seekers convinced they'll have to
run in November on a ticket headed by Gore. The high turnout and
maverick tendencies of the late-deciding and late-registering
independent voters lifted both Bradley and McCain, but lifted
McCain higher.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire rewarded the warrior who lost five and a half
years to the Hanoi Hilton and emerged here as a Biblical prophet
excoriating the money-changers in the temple. We have rugged races
ahead in both parties, but this one belonged to the gallant,
high-road crusade mounted by John McCain.

 &HT;    GORE SAYS TOUGH N.H. BATTLE STRENGTHENED HIS CAMPAIGN
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore solidified his lead in
the race for the Democratic presidential nomination with a victory
in the New Hampshire primary Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a hard-fought campaign,'' Gore acknowledged in
claiming his victory at a celebration with hundreds of supporters
at a downtown hotel.
</P>
<P>
   He said challenger Bill Bradley forced him to ``fight for every
vote.'' As a result, ``the contest made us stronger,'' he added.
``This is a more focused and stronger campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   In his victory speech, Gore compared the closeness of the
primary victory to Sunday's Super Bowl, in which the Tennessee
Titans fell one short against the victorious St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the day today, some people thought this might be like
the Super Bowl _ they thought that we might fall a yard short,'' he
said. ``But let me tell you, this Tennessean is in the end zone,
and it feels great.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore alluded to the changing nature of the campaign, which now
becomes a national primary with contests in 15 states, including
California, New York, Georgia and Ohio, on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just begun to fight,'' he said. ``We're going to march
all the way down the field, from state to state, from coast to
coast, all the way to victory in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also tentatively accepted the invitation from Bradley to
debate every week until the March 7 primaries. The vice president
had issued a similar challenge to the senator weeks ago, but with
the additional condition that the two candidates forgo television
advertising in favor of the debates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane said the vice president
would still prefer his original proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's margin of victory appeared to be the slimmest ever in the
history of Democratic primaries in the Granite State, however, even
though he tried to cast his campaign as ``the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   The slim victory was especially significant in view of Gore's
status as the incumbent vice president, with the endorsement of the
state's popular Democratic governor, Jeanne Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was the second time that Gore and Bradley had faced
off before voters and the second time the vice president had
defeated the former senator from New Jersey. Gore won the Iowa
caucus a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   In his victory speech, Gore noted that he had trailed Bradley in
the state for weeks and credited his turnaround to a series of town
meetings he held with New Hampshire voters in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore isn't the first presidential candidate to hold such
meetings in New Hampshire, a state long known for its ``retail''
politics in which the candidates must get up close and personal
with voters.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the Republican presidential contest, Sen. John
McCain of Arizona has held 114 open meetings in the Granite State
since declaring his candidacy last year, a number that eclipses
Gore's 12 open meetings by far.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore is the first presidential candidate whose open meetings
have been open-ended. Consequently, many of them last for more than
three hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll stay as long as you want, as long as somebody has a
question,'' Gore usually says at the start of his meetings. And he
does, even when only a handful of voters remain, either to ask him
a question, get an autograph or take a photo of him.
</P>
<P>
   The use of such forums has turned one of Gore's biggest
weaknesses _ his tendency to talk at length about policy issues _
into a strength. The voters rarely complain that he is being
long-winded.
</P>
<P>
   The forums also showcase Gore's sense of humor, which has been
largely hidden from public view.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, for example, Gore sneezed in the middle of someone's
question. His body microphone, which had gone dead earlier, was
activated and filled the auditorium with the amplified sound of
Gore's sneeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``NOW the microphone works,'' Gore quipped.

SUPER BOWL SPOTS SEEM TO WORK FOR MANY DOT-COMS AS TRAFFIC TO THEIR
SITES GROWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Calif., Ga.)   (Eds: The word (star) should be replaced with the symbol)  
 (af)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year after the Super Bowl, Madison Avenue assesses the
performance of the advertisers that spent the huge sums required to
run commercials during the game. This time, with Super Bowl XXXIV
being considered the first Dot-Com Bowl _ 17 of the 36 companies
sponsoring the broadcast were related to the Internet _ the results
are being more closely followed than ever.
</P>
<P>
   That's particularly true for the dot-com debutantes that used
the Super Bowl as their coming-out party, introducing themselves to
the estimated 130.75 million Americans who watched the game on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Will viewers now go online to visit the Web sites of the
dot-coms? Will the Web sites bear up under increased traffic? Will
visitors like what they see? Will they buy anything?
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that no one tracks shoppers at convenience stores the
day after the Super Bowl, wondering whether the products of
traditional advertisers like Budweiser, Mountain Dew, 7Up and
Tropicana are moving off shelves faster. And forget that few, if
any, analysts count tickets sold at movie theaters for films
advertised during the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The dot-coms are held to different standards, perhaps because of
their insistent assertions that there's no business like
e-business.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, several efforts are being made to measure the
post-game performance of the dot-com commercials. The most
ambitious is a study by Media Metrix, which examined the Internet
sites of Super Bowl advertisers to measure the average number of
daily unique visitors (people who visit a Web site) before and
after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It either worked or it didn't,'' said Doug McFarland, senior
vice president and general manager at Media Metrix. ``You either
did very well or you had no change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' he added, ``the real story will be watching these
sites over the next six to eight months, to see if what worked for
Hotjobs.com and Monster.com can happen again. Getting a nice spike
is nice, but how many will remember the name and come back?''
</P>
<P>
   McFarland's reference was to two dot-coms, both operators of
job-search sites, which first captured the public's attention by
advertising during Super Bowl XXXIII in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, the Media Metrix survey showed that traffic
to dot-com sites soared on Sunday and Monday compared with the
average figures for the three weeks before the game _ climbing
sharply from few or even no measurable visitors before to thousands
or tens of thousands after.
</P>
<P>
   Such showings were made by companies like Computer.com;
Hotjobs.com; Kforce.com, part of Romac International;
Microstrategy; and Ourbeginning.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled,'' said Joe Payne, chief marketing officer at
Microstrategy in Vienna, Va., a software maker that ran two
commercials, created in-house, during the first and fourth quarters
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Super Bowl helps us to do one deal,'' he added, ``it'll
pay for itself.'' Super Bowl advertisers paid a record average of
$2.2 million for each 30 seconds of commercial time.
</P>
<P>
   Other dot-coms that enjoyed substantial gains in Web site
traffic, according to the Media Metrix survey, included
Britannica.com; Lifeminders.com; Oxygen.com, part of Oxygen Media;
Pets.com; WebMD.com, operated by Healtheon/WebMD; and WSJ.com, part
of Dow Jones &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   For some Super Bowl dot-coms, traffic to their sites showed
little or no change, the survey showed, possibly because they
already were ``very high profile names,'' before their commercials
ran, McFarland said. Those included the E(star)Trade Group and
Monster.com.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Willard, custom analysis director for Media Metrix in
Atlanta, identified some Web sites, for newer dot-coms, that
registered relatively small gains in visitors, though the
percentage increases were high. They included: Epidemic.com, from
9,000 to 30,000 visitors; Lastminutetravel.com, which ran its spot
immediately after the game ended, from 6,000 to 27,000 visitors;
and Netpliance.com, from no measurable traffic to 8,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
   And in some instances, the survey found no measurable traffic to
the sites of dot-com advertisers after the game. Those included
Autotrader.com and OnMoney.com. Media Metrix bases its numbers on
the patterns of a panel of 50,000 Web users.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the 10 sites with the most traffic after the game were
dot-coms, the survey showed. The exception was the Web site of
World Wrestling Federation Entertainment (www.wwf.com). Other
dot-coms with good postgame numbers included Federal Express
(www.fedex.com); the largest decline was registered by Motorola
(www.motorola.com), down 23.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Having looked at the traffic to the Web sites of Super Bowl
advertisers, how did those sites perform once they began getting
hits? That was the province of a study by Keynote Systems, a
provider of Web site performance measurement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them did pretty well,'' said Gene Shklar, vice
president for public services at Keynote in San Mateo, Calif.,
``but nine showed performance anomalies.'' Those included the sites
of Autotrader.com, Epidemic.com, Kforce.com, Lastminutetravel.com
and Universal Pictures, part of the Seagram Co., which advertised
two films during the game, ``The Nutty Professor II'' and
``U-571.''
</P>
<P>
   Most sites that experienced ``performance degradation'' during
or after the game were operating normally by Tuesday, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones with no problems at all,'' Shklar said, ``seemed to
be the companies that have done this for a while and learned to
scale their Web sites for peak demand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Super Bowl was a watershed event in the integration of
television and the Web,'' he added. ``When a huge audience glued to
the TV screen sees a commercial with a URL., they will get up and
access the site. You know the Web's a monster when you see a
Budweiser ad and `www.budweiser.com' is at the bottom of the
screen.''
</P>
<P>
   According to another survey, by Harris Interactive, two-thirds
of Internet users reported watching the Super Bowl, but the dot-com
advertising had only relatively low awareness and effectiveness
among them.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when survey respondents were asked specifically
about certain dot-coms advertisers, so-called aided awareness, only
four dot-coms scored in double digits: E(star)Trade, 54 percent;
Pets.com, 41 percent; Monster.com, 24 percent; and Hotjobs.com, 11
percent. All were significant advertisers before the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   When the Harris Interactive Intermedia Pulse study asked if a
commercial ``made you plan to visit'' the dot-com's Web site, the
highest response, at 38 percent, came for Britannica.com, which ran
a commercial in the third quarter by Deutsch Inc. The other top
scorers were: Autotrader.com, 33 percent; Computer.com and
Hotjobs.com, tied at 27 percent; and Kforce.com, 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the responses: Oxygen.com, 21 percent; Pets.com, 20
percent; Monster.com, 18 percent; Etrade.com, 17 percent; and
Lifeminders.com, 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other surveys, in the spirit of Dot-Com Bowl I, were taken
online, asking computer users to rate spots.
</P>
<P>
   Adcritic.com, a Web site operated since the last Super Bowl by
Peter Beckman, a self-described ad fan, is asking visitors to vote
for favorite spots. The leader Tuesday afternoon was the ``Bohemian
Rhapsody'' parody spot for Mountain Dew, sold by the Pepsi-Cola Co.
unit of PepsiCo and created by BBDO New York, part of the BBDO
Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 was the E(star)Trade monkey commercial about ``wasting''
ad dollars, by Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners, also part of
Omnicom. The No. 3 spot was the ``cat herders'' for EDS, by Fallon
McElligott, which was leading in a separate poll by Yahoo, the
portal Web site, at www.yahoo.com/promotions/superspots.
</P>
<P>
   A Microstrategy spot was second in the Yahoo poll Tuesday
afternoon. The Pets.com spot _ by the San Francisco office of
TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom _ was
third.

 McCAIN WINS BIG VICTORY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout) 
 (sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Sen. John McCain trounced Gov. George W. Bush
on Tuesday in the New Hampshire Republican primary, defeating him
by a margin far wider than anyone in either campaign had
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's triumph was particularly exceptional because surveys of
voters on Tuesday found it was built not only on a core of
independents but also on wide and deep support among faithful
Republicans whom the Bush campaign considered its most reliable
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the race turns to Delaware, South Carolina, and then to
Michigan and Arizona, Republican strategists say the question is
whether McCain can propel his victory into a genuine challenge to
Bush. For months, the Texas governor has been widely viewed as the
front-runner because of his towering financial advantage, his vast
endorsements from elected Republicans and his victory in the Iowa
caucuses last week.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain and Bush have for weeks sparred over the size of
their tax-cut proposals and the depth of their opposition to
abortion, the surveys of voters found that the most crucial factor
among the two-term senator's backers was that they viewed him as a
candidate of unshakeable character who was willing to stand up for
his convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but be amazed by the size of this,'' McCain
said from his hotel suite in Nashua after being told he had won.
``You can't help but be amazed by the size of this. It's across the
board, came from all sectors _ conservatives, moderates liberals,
women. It was a win for the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a rally, McCain, smiling broadly as a raucous crowd
cheered him on, stressed his insurgent message: ``We have sent a
powerful message to Washington that change is coming. This is a
good thing. And it is the beginning of the end of the
truth-twisting politics of Bill Clinton and Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   With nearly half the votes tallied on Tuesday night, McCain held
a lead of nearly 18 percentage points _ about 15,000 votes, over
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides, seeking to capitalize on an outcome that was far
more lopsided than they had anticipated, immediately sought to step
up their fund-raising as a first step to quickly assembling
organizations in several states. They acknowledged that they could
never amass as much money as Bush, who has collected nearly $69
million, compared with nearly $14 million for McCain. But they said
they want to raise enough to compete aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   The results stunned Bush and his advisers, who for days had
happily predicted they would win here. Even on Tuesday morning,
Bush confidently said, ``I'm going to win.'' On Tuesday night, at a
rally in Goffstown, Bush emphasized that he was ready to compete
nationwide. ``The road to the Republican nomination and the White
House is a long road,'' he declared to subdued but cheering
supporters. ``Mine will go through all 50 states _ and I intend it
to end at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting that McCain won not over the issues but because he
campaigned here almost nonstop for months, Bush, flanked by his
wife, Laura, and his twin teen-age daughters, said, ``He spent more
time in this great state than any of the other candidates and it
paid off. Tonight is his night and the night of his supporters. And
we all congratulate him.'' Bush stumped here 36 days; McCain 65.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first political loss for the two-term governor
since his defeat in his first run for office, when he ran for the
House in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, Bush's aides were struggling to explain what
happened, but insisted that his massive financial advantage would
ultimately carry them to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Some Bush advisers said they intended to turn up their attacks
on McCain. ``He's going to walk right into our punch in South
Carolina,'' said one adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The results on Tuesday night affirmed McCain's decision to skip
the Iowa caucuses. Steve Forbes, who finished second to Bush in
that contest, placed a distant third here on Tuesday night. They
were trailed by Alan Keyes, the former State Department official,
and Gary L. Bauer, a prominent religious conservative whom aides
said was weighing whether to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Bauer praised Mr. McCain for his ``incredibly
strong'' showing and, suggesting he would soon withdraw, said,
``I'm not delusional.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's win set off a furious round of finger-pointing among
Bush's advisers over whether he neglected the state too long, was
too passive in his commercials and even over whether he erred in
campaigning here with his father on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Some advisers suggested that by standing on a stage with the
former president, Bush reinforced questions about whether he was
riding on his father's popularity and was ready himself to be
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stunning win for Senator McCain,'' said Steve Duprey,
chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party. ``The danger for
Bush of an insurgency campaign is that McCain has a brush fire that
he's going to try to turn into a wildfire. If Governor Bush had
beaten Senator McCain decisively it would have crippled, if not
mortally wounded his campaign. Governor Bush may well survive a
loss. His challenge is to make sure that Senator McCain doesn't
score a series of victories.''

   The surveys of voters leaving polls said independents turned out
in force to back McCain. More than 4 in 10 voters said they were
independents, an increase from 35 percent four years ago. Six in 10
of those independents voters for McCain, while fewer than 2 in 10
backed Bush _ and even fewer than that voted for Forbes. The
surveys were conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium created
by ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Fox News, NBC News and the Associated
Press. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the Republican voters, half described themselves as
conservatives and they divided their votes evenly between McCain
and Bush. About 1 in 6 voters described themselves as very
conservative, about the same proportion who said they were part of
the religious right. Bush did well among this group, but not
resoundingly so. He captured about 3 in 10 voters of religious
conservatives while McCain and Forbes each took about 2 in 10 of
their votes.
</P>
<P>
   For all the wrangling over abortion, the issue in the end did
not seem to have played a role in the voters' decisions. Only 1 in
20 said it was the issue that mattered most to them. Asked directly
what their views were, 1 in 10 Republicans said abortion should
always be illegal. They voted for Bush but, again, not resoundingly
so. But among those with other views on abortion _ those who said
it should be illegal in most cases, legal in most cases or legal in
all cases _ backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The voter surveys found that people credited Mr. McCain with
saying what he believes no matter what the political consequences.
Bush, the voters said, was more likely to pander.
</P>
<P>
   Several supporters of McCain said in interviews that they found
his history as a war hero in Vietnam and his no-nonsense
disposition appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided at the last minute,'' said Jim Arruda, 55, a program
manager from Derry. ``My plan was to vote for John McCain or
against Al Gore. And I voted for McCain. I have a better sense for
who McCain is. And on the Republican side, George Bush just seems
to have no substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim McLaughlin, 41, an electrical engineer, put it this way,
``It was a toss-up between McCain and Bush. I watched the debate
last week, and I was swayed toward McCain. His military experience
was important, he came across as an intelligent man, and someone
who was passionate about his message.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Sen. John McCain's great gamble paid off Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The state on which he bet his all _ and logged nearly 20,000
miles in his campaign bus _ did not just give him a victory over
Texas Gov. George Bush, it gave him a landslide and sent him
roaring into South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the Republican Party has recovered its heritage of
reform,'' McCain said, grinning broadly, in a balloon-bedecked
hotel ballroom, as he thanked his supporters for heeding his call
to ``break the Washington Iron Triangle of big money, lobbyists and
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving a taste of how he might take on the Democrats, he said,
``This is a good thing, my friends. And it is the beginning of the
end of the truth-twisting politics of Bill Clinton and Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   He cast his campaign as an effort to ``return to a time of
conservative common sense in Washington'' and said that a ``great
national crusade has just begun.''
</P>
<P>
   But even McCain appeared stunned by the magnitude of his win
despite a year of relentless campaigning in New Hampshire. On the
eighth floor of the hotel where McCain, his family and friends were
gathered around a television in the Presidential Suite, his wife,
Cindy, put her hand to her mouth and her eyes welled up when CNN
proclaimed McCain's victory. ``It really happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said simply, ``You can't help but be amazed by the size
of this. It's across the board, came from all sectors _
conservatives, moderates, liberals, women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a win for the message,'' he said. ``The people in
Washington are going to wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   His aides were giddy and his supporters triumphant. Asked what
the results meant for Bush, Mike Murphy, McCain's senior
strategist, grinned and said one word _``iceberg'' _ to conjure up
the image of the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   As McCain's supporters watched Bush concede on television they
booed when the governor tried to dismiss New Hampshire as a state
that had ``long been known as a bump in the road for
front-runners.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain still lacks the vast resources and national organization
of Bush, who emphasized all day that he was the candidate who could
last through the long-haul. But McCain has been telling his
audiences that a decisive win here will give him a ``megaphone'' to
broadcast his message of reform Republicanism to voters across the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's press secretary, Howard Opinsky, said that after the
senator's speech, the campaign raised $14,000 in 90 minutes on its
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The next major test comes in South Carolina, which holds the
first of the southern primaries, on Feb. 19, and which has
traditionally restored battered establishment front-runners instead
of promoting mavericks. McCain has been gaining ground there but
still lags far behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain said he expected his victory to awaken voters in
South Carolina. ``South Carolina doesn't sit out in the ocean by
itself,'' he said recently. ``South Carolina is impacted by the
national media, the same way every other state is.''
</P>
<P>
   Not wasting a moment, he pulled out of New Hampshire quickly
Tuesday night and headed toward his next must-win state where
supporters were holding a post midnight rally at the
Greenville/Spartanburg airport.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, both McCain's methods and his message were
unorthodox. With limited money, he decided to skip the Iowa
caucuses and focus entirely on the first primary state, New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   McCain held 114 of his free-wheeling unscripted town hall
meetings and put nearly 20,000 miles on his bus, emblazoned with
the motto ``Straight Talk Express,'' which became a kind of moving
press conference and political salon.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign themes, too, broke with party dogma. As Republican
leaders in Washington insisted that unrestrained campaign spending
was free speech, McCain put the overhaul of the campaign finance
system at the very heart of his candidacy. And instead of endorsing
large tax cuts, he put forward a plan for moderate tax cuts that
would devote billions of dollars from the federal surplus to Social
Security and paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's gripping personal story as a prisoner of war also added
to his appeal. He spent time Tuesday afternoon in his suite with
four of the men who had been held and tortured with him in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the former POWs even took their turn at warming up
the ballroom crowd. ``How could one on the road to coronation
possibly lose?'' asked one, Orson Swindle, mocking Bush. ``It was
inevitable right?'' As the throngs cheered, ``Go, John, Go,''
Swindle said, ``We've got the man. We've got the man.''

VICITMS OF FLIGHT 216: `IT`S JUST TOO SAD' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the victims of Alaska Air Flight 216:
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Clemetson and infant Spencer, David Clemetson, Blake
Clemetson, Miles Clemetson, and Coriander Clemetson
</P>
<P>
   The names were all there Tuesday, dreadfully repetitive, on
Flight 261's passenger manifest. All six members of a young Seattle
family, stolen away:
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Clemetson and infant
</P>
<P>
   David Clemetson
</P>
<P>
   Blake Clemetson
</P>
<P>
   Miles Clemetson
</P>
<P>
   Coriander Clemetson
</P>
<P>
   David, a 40-year-old beloved Burien-area physician, who liked
being a dad as much as a doctor, gone.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Carolyn, a stay-at-home mom who got to know everyone
in the couple's Queen Anne neighborhood, gone.
</P>
<P>
   Their four children, three of them John Hay Elementary School
students, gone.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, the light-blue, two-story wood-framed house the
Clemetson family once called home was receiving visitors Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lights flickered into the evening. A yellow toy dumptruck sat
idle in the back yard under grey skies and drizzle. At the front
door, a housesitter, a woman who had expected to welcome home a
handful of excited kids and their mom and dad from a warm weekend,
instead hosted a private wake.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the small circle of family and friends there cared to
talk.
</P>
<P>
   In Burien south of Seattle, where David Clemetson worked in
internal medicine and infectious diseases at the Three Tree
Internal Medicine clinic, staff and patients were dazed and
red-eyed, working while remembering the family they knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``David was a sweetheart of a person. He was someone you could
count on as a friend,''said Paul Baker, a nurse practitioner who
shared an office with Clementson, and considered him a friend and
mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suddenness of their loss makes you appreciate those you
have in your own life, to hug your own family and make sure they
know it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clemetsons each brought children from prior marriages to
their union, and together had a son, Spencer, six months ago. David
Clemetson had daughters, Blake, a first-grader, and Coriander, a
second-grader, and adopted Carolyn's son, Miles, a first-grader.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said the family had lived on the block for about three
years. Carolyn Clemetson, who loved life and people, made it a
point to get to know just about everyone.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor who declined to be named remembered a New Year's
party at the couple's home last month. Carolyn Clemetson had
remarked: ``I love my family so much. The neat thing about the kids
now is they like hanging out with us. They think we're cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor, Effie Cain, recalled the Clemetson girls as
``lively. I could hear those little patent-leather shoes going up
their steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Miles's prize possession was a little scooter he bought by
saving money from small chores, on which he powered himself up and
down the block.
</P>
<P>
   Clemetson's coworkers said he was flying standby to Mexico last
week, and was excited about getting away with his family for a few
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``David just wanted to have a long weekend vacation with his
family, who were his utmost priority,'' said office manager Lynn
Kriedman. ``He had a very active practice in infectious diseases
and primary care.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemetson so adored his family that even the screen saver on his
computer was a photo of his newborn son. Baker said Clemetson cut
back on clinic hours to spend more time with family after Spencer's
birth.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor was born in Saskatchewan and became a U.S. citizen in
1977 when he entered Duke University. He studied medicine at Guy's
Hospital Medical School in London from 1979-1984, taking
post-graduate training at Oxford University and Brown University in
Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   He spent several years studying infectious diseases in Kenya and
New Guinea. From 1989 to 1992 he was a senior fellow at the
University of Washington's infectious diseases training program and
remained on UW's clinical faculty after joining the Highline
hospital in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said Clemetson physician was ``an excellent teacher, he
trusted you. Once he knew you `got it,' and you could show him you
`got it,' he had confidence in you.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the good times Baker recalled were needling Clemetson,
hoping to evoke the doctor's marvelous laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he was trained in England, he had a streak of
properness about him,'' Baker said. ``I used to pull his chain on
that and get him to smile.''
</P>
<P>
   When he put down his doctor's bag after hours, Clemetson put on
a carpenter's belt to work at his hobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He absolutely loved carpentry,'' Baker said. ``He remodeled
his house himself, everything _ walls, floors _ and was always
getting new tools or talking about tools,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said his first thoughts when he learned Clemetson and is
family were on Flight 261 was of Clemetson's smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a wonderful smile. All I thought was that the thing I
will miss most is his smile,'' Baker said quietly _ ``all their
smiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Monte Donaldson and Colleen Whorley
</P>
<P>
   Monte Donaldson had just started work on an a short indie film.
His fiance, Colleen Whorley, had recently earned another promotion
at Microsoft, where she worked as an art director.
</P>
<P>
   They planned a September wedding and a honeymoon to Indonesia
and Ireland. But the young couple's bright plans for the future
went down in the Pacific Ocean Monday when their Alaska Airlines
jet crashed off the California coast. They were young, and very
much in love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like them to be remembered for their degree of
sensitivity,'' said Adam Suhl, 32, a close friend of the couple.
</P>
<P>
   Suhl, along with his girlfriend, Mary Bisceglia, 23, has been
house sitting for Whorley, 34, and Donaldson, 31.
</P>
<P>
   Having attended a family reunion with Whorley's stepfather, John
Sanchez, in Puerto Vallarta, the couple traveled for two more weeks
before returning home to their cottage-like Seattle home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were both lovers of beauty and harmony, and you could
really hear that in Monte's music,'' said Suhl in a hushed voice,
expressing the sadness and shock he's feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Whorley loved photography, he said. One day, he believes, she
would have gone far in that pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson, a freelance DJ who performed as DJ E.E.G _ was known
in local clubs for his ambient mixes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was usually relegated to the chill room,'' Suhl said with a
smile, referring to the mellow tempo of his music. Donaldson also
loved traveling and had a thing for collecting sentimental
memorabilia _ rocks, fortune cookie messages and the like.
</P>
<P>
   He was also unabashedly crazy about Whorley, sending her post
cards from his travels in Asia last winter. In one post card,
mailed from Thailand, Donaldson says he feels ``ecstatic'' when he
think of spending the rest of his life with her.
</P>
<P>
   Bisceglia says that in an e-mail Donaldson sent Suhl from
Mexico, he said that he was falling in love with Whorley for the
10th time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what made them stand out ... it was their love for one
another,'' says Bisceglia, sorting through the photos documenting
the couple's eight-year history.
</P>
<P>
   It was that last trip to Asia that convinced Donaldson to
include Bali, Indonesia, along with Ireland, as part of his
honeymoon plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked what he saw there and he wanted to share that with
her,'' says Suhl.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Suhl and Bisceglia erected a shrine of sorts to honor
their friends in the home the young couple had purchased last year.
</P>
<P>
   It includes photos of the couple, Whorley's favorite hat and
scarf, Donaldson's rock collection and one of his particularly cool
vintage shirts, among other treasured items.
</P>
<P>
   In the photos, Donaldson's darkly handsome features stand in
contrast to Whorley's mop of wild curls and almost dreamy smile
(which seems to appear in most of the dozens of photos stacked and
scattered on the living room floor).
</P>
<P>
   But he was always smiling when he was standing next to her.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney, Sarah, Rachael and Grace Pearson
</P>
<P>
   He was a pillar of of a good many Seattle restaurants over the
years. She was an outgoing Alaska Airlines flight attendant. They
were devoted parents to their two daughters, 6-year-old Rachael and
22-month-old Grace.
</P>
<P>
   For their friends, the loss of Rodney and Sarah Pearson and
their girls is painful almost beyond description.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to get through the day,'' said Tom Church,
president of Six Degrees restaurants in Seattle and suburban
Kirkland. Rodney Pearson was vice president of operations for Six
Degrees, where he was extremely well liked by staff and customers
both, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has hit a lot of people,'' Church said. ``There's been
tears. A lot of managers are on duty today ... because servers with
a lot of history with Rod stayed home.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson, 45, had at least 25 years in the restaurant business,
and worked at many well-known restaurants in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a person in love with the industry,'' Church said. ``He
was hands-on. He met people at the door. He would bus tables. He
didn't put himself above anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But as much as Pearson loved his work, he always set aside
Sundays for his family, Church said. Family always came first, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And if his wife was off flying, he wouldn't hesitate to bring
his daughters into work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would be bouncing them on his knee while he trained
staff,'' Church said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pearsons were on a family vacation, traveling on Alaska
employee passes. It was their first vacation together in some time,
friends said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Mitchelli IV, chef at Trattoria Mitchelli, said he'd
known Pearson since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible thing,'' Mitchelli said. ``We go back a ways,
Rod and me. He had two little girls, and I have a little girl. ...
it's so scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson was loved by those who worked for him, in part because
he was never afraid to pitch in to do whatever needed to be done,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got his hands dirty and busted butt,'' Michelli said. ``He
was the epitome of the team player.''
</P>
<P>
   Bo Bonina, vice president of food and beverages for the Seattle
Athletic Club, opened several restaurants with Pearson in 1993.
They'd been friends since, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very good guy, extremely gregarious. He was a devoted
family man,'' Bonina said. ``And his wife, she was ... outgoing and
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Rod Pearson was also a talented athlete. He loved cycling and
was a former star high school wrestler in Seattle, Bonina said.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Pearson, 36, whose maiden name was Manning, was from
Spokane, he said. Bonina spoke to her father, who was attempting to
cope with the loss of the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a devastating thing to lose a child, as well as
grandchildren and a son-in-law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pearson lived in a tidy clapboard beige-and-white home in
Seattle. Next door at a neighbor's house, a note taped to a wreath
read ``Friends and neighbors come in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be surprised at how important they were to this block,''
said one neighbor at the house who did not give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Bonina said Pearson was so devoted to his wife and daughters, he
could not have borne their loss. He would have wanted to go with
them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If if could have chosen it, this is what he would have
wanted,'' Bonina said.
</P>
<P>
   But for those left behind, it's almost unbearable to lose a
whole family at once, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People die, it happens, but this is so damn unbelievable,''
Bonia said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan and Abigail Busche
</P>
<P>
   On better days, there was truth in the cheerful answering
machine message that promised callers a speedy return call from
``Abby and Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the voice mailbox was full at the young couple's
Seattle home and calls went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan and Abigail Busche meet as art students at Western
Washington University, graduating in 1996. They moved to Seattle
and married in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The couple was hired two years ago to design software and Web
pages for ArtSource Inc., a Bellevue art production and design
company that contracts with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jeff Christensen said he and other ArtSource workers were
shaken by the loss of the well-regarded employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``(This) is a community, and there are lots of folks who know
these people. It's very somber today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Busche, 28, who designed sports games, was a ``soft-spoken,
sweet guy who was good at what he did,'' Christensen said. Abby,
25, a product designer, accepted a full-time job with Microsoft in
October.
</P>
<P>
   In the South Seattle neighborhood where the couple settled 18
months ago, news of their deaths struck a personal chord.
</P>
<P>
   Yuriko Ued, who lives across the street, gazed at the Busches'
red Volkswagen station wagon parked in the driveway, and expressed
regret at not having gotten to know the couple better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't speak, we just waved _ that kind of a greeting,''
she said. ``It's too sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom and Peggy Stockley
</P>
<P>
   Tom Stockley was a big deal among wine growers, wine dealers and
those who simply liked to wet their whistles. But what triggered
that affection wasn't just the stuff he wrote, or the kudos he
awarded a particular vintage.
</P>
<P>
   They just loved the guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wine writers as a breed can have a. . . well, a kind of
arrogance about themselves,'' said Joe Algeo, national sales
manager for Arbor Crest Wine Cellars in Spokane. ``Tom never
displayed that, ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Algeo's appraisal was just a taste of what others had to say
about Stockley, 63, wine columnist for the Seattle Times, and his
wife of 40 years, Peggy, 62.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always considered them guiding lights,'' said Jeri
Callahan, a neighbor at the Lake Union houseboat moorage where the
Stockleys' lived in Seattle. The couple holed up there 20 years ago
after raising two children in Bellevue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been the glue that's held this place together,''
Callahan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stockleys and Callahan met in Puerto Vallarta for dinner the
weekend before last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not like them at all,'' she said. ``They had splurged on a
fancy hotel on the beach. Tom said that was OK because they
wouldn't have to buy the wine. He'd brought his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockley's advice on wine was cited widely. It was used in
stores operated by the State Liquor Control Board as well as by
such retail outlets as Larry's Market.
</P>
<P>
   At Pete's, a special neighborhood grocery with a wide wine
selection, owner George Kingen expressed shock at the crash news.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were friends,'' he said. ``We'd have dinner together at
least a couple of times a year. In fact, we'd just had them over to
the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Times food editor Sharon Lane spoke of Tom Stockley's common
touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about him, he wasn't a wine snob,'' she said. ``If
you were having a dinner party and wanted to know what wine to
serve, you could call him up even at his home, and he'd make a few
suggestions. He wrote for the average person and he was just so
nice to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockley followed the wine beat under a special contract with
his newspaper after retiring as the Sunday magazine's assistant
editor 10 years ago. He broke into the newspaper business at the
Bremerton Sun, and joined the Times in 1967. As a wine writer, he
literally ``grew up with the Washington wine industry,'' said Steve
Burns, executive director of the Washington Wine Commission in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he started writing about wine more than 20 years ago, we
had 15 wineries. Today there are more than 150.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said news that Stockley was killed in the crash stunned
wine people around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been getting calls from all over,'' he said. ``One came
from a writer in London who said `tell me it's not true.' Then Gary
Hogue of Hogue Cellars called from Copenhagen. He wanted to know if
he should come home.''
</P>
<P>
   But the wine writer wasn't the only Stockley star.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy's light shined as brightly, in other circles.
</P>
<P>
   Like her husband, she graduated in journalism from the
University of Washington. She then worked briefly for the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   On Lake Union, she held the houseboat community together as
secretary of the Floating Homes Association, and has helped a
variety of social-service agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The couple is survived by daughters Paige Stockley, a
professional cellist, and Dina Stockley Moreno, who is married with
a 21-month-old daughter, Luisa, and Peggy's 93-year-old mother,
Margaret Hodges, all of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Hodges learned of her daughter's death, she had been
rummaging through a chest of drawers and discovered a small yellow
Post-It note tucked in a corner. It said, ``I love you,'' and was
signed, ``Peggy.''

<P>
   Meghann Hall, Ryan Sparks, Rachel Janosik
</P>
<P>
   The ties that come with small-town life bound Meghann Hall, Ryan
Sparks and Rachel Janosik tightly.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they grew into young adults in Enumclaw, Wash., in the
shadow of the Cascades, learned English and biology at Enumclaw
High and played for the honor of their school on athletic fields
and in the gym.
</P>
<P>
   They had graduated from the school and moved on. But small towns
don't forget their own. News of Monday's plane crash triggered a
wave of grieving.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some kids who are pretty shook up here today,'' said
Rick Ofstrand, a counselor and basketball coach at the high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad night in Enumclaw tonight,'' added Josh Ladda, a
friend of Hall's.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, 19, was an ace pitcher on the school softball team.
Janosik, 20, played on the same team, said her grandfather, Philip
Janosik.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, 20, was Hall's boyfriend. Basketball was his sport,
though a knee injury his senior year kept him from playing much.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ofstrand had no problem remembering a young man who
graduated three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a great kid, a real mature kid,'' Ofstrand said.
``He was a real leader here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks had been working full-time in a box factory.
</P>
<P>
   Hall was one of the best pitchers in the state and won an
athletic scholarship to Highline Community College. She worked at
Bed, Bath &AMP; Beyond at the Auburn Supermall.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was an incredible person,'' Ladda said. ``Meghann was very
outgoing, quick-witted, entertaining and intelligent. ... She had a
way of singling out one aspect of a person and never forgetting, no
matter how many people she knew or touched. She always
remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   Her death marked the second time her family lost a child. A
brother died in a motorcycle accident four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Janosik had moved to Bellevue, where she attended community
college and played sports, her grandfather said. Last August, she
got a job with Horizon Air. She would stock planes with food and
beverages before they left Sea-Tac International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was happy as a lark there. She was just tickled to death
to have a full-time job,'' Philip Janosik said.
</P>
<P>
   A side benefit of airline work was flying for free. It was
perfect for Janosik.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was her fourth or fifth trip on passes,'' Philip Janosik
said. ``She had been to Mexico a bunch. She really liked it down
there.''
</P>
<P>
   She decided to go to Puerto Vallarta again, and she took her old
friends from Enumclaw with her for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy passes'' is what Ofstrand, the high school counselor,
called them.
</P>
<P>
   Don Shaw
</P>
<P>
   Don Shaw was on his way back from a househunting trip in Mexico.
For years, the 63-year-old Shelton, Wash., man and his wife had
traveled to Mexico on vacations. Now, a few years after his
retirement, it was time to find a place on the beach to call their
own.
</P>
<P>
   But his wife, Earlene, had a new business and some commitments.
So Don Shaw, the former principal of four elementary schools in the
Snohomish School District, traveled alone on Alaska Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only imagine what she's going through right now,'' said
Nancy Whitson, a longtime friend and a principal at Totem Lake
Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   Before becoming principal, Don Shaw was an elementary-school
teacher and librarian in Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to the Snohomish School District in 1976,'' Whitson
said, ``and Don was on my interview committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were running a little late and he came out and _ as he
would do so many times _ put his hand on my shoulder and said,
`Don't worry.'''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw retired in 1991, and he and his wife moved to Shelton. He
volunteered as a tour guide at the state Capitol; Earlene worked in
the Capitol cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's friends paint a picture of a man committed to his job and
his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``His love for his jobs and the kids were unparalleled,
certainly that I've ever seen,'' said Rod Vroman, a longtime
principal in the district and a good friend. ``If you ever wanted
to meet a kind, gentle man, Don was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert and Lorna Thorgrimson
</P>
<P>
   Retiree Robert Thorgrimson and his wife, Lorna, a department
store saleswoman, lived in Poulsbo, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thorgrimson, 63, was the grandson of a founding partner
in the Preston, Gates &AMP; Ellis law firm based in Seattle. He is
survived by an adult son and daughter, and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The Thorgrimsons, described by neighbors and relatives as
private and reserved, were eager to leave behind the winter gloom
of the Northwest for a Mexican getaway. Lorna Thorgrimson, 53, sold
furniture at the Silverdale Bon Marche.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they were quite excited about going on vacation for two
weeks in Puerto Vallarta,'' said longtime neighbor Ruth Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, relatives descended on the couple's rambling
seven-bedroom home off Hood Canal.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Wall, 96, who has lived down the street from the family
for more than 20 years, recalled happier homecomings. ``I remember
when a bunch of college students would be at the house,'' Wall
said. ``There were so many boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorgrimson's father, Richard, built the waterfront property as
a summer home in 1973, while a law partner in Preston, Thorgrimson,
Shidler, Gates &AMP; Lucas, a firm his father helped found. On his
death, the home passed to Robert and his two younger brothers, now
deceased.
</P>
<P>
   Margery Thorgrimson, who was married to Robert for 23 years,
said her former husband was fond of skiing, golf and gardening.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is tough for the kids,'' she said. ``But I'll be with
them over the next few days. They'll be just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison Shanks
</P>
<P>
   Allison Shanks adored her 4-year-old daughter Haile, frequently
rollerbladed around Seattle's Green Lake with her and showered the
child with clothes. She tried to work only on weekends as a flight
attendant so family members could care for Haile while she was
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was an incredible woman, an incredible mother,'' said
Shanks' sister-in-law, Jamie Shanks. ``She loved her job, loved to
travel, loved the camaraderie of being a senior flight attendant.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison Shanks, 33, joined Alaska in December 1988. On a layover
in Mexico, she met a man who would become her husband. They lived
in Los Angeles, but divorced when Haile was only three months old,
Jamie Shanks said.
</P>
<P>
   Mother and daughter moved back to Seattle, living in Issaquah
with Allison's mother, Dolores.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were best friends,'' Shanks said.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Allison and Haile moved to a three-story
condominium across from Seattle's Woodland Park Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   When Allison flew on weekends, Haile would stay with her
grandparents or other relatives. But she loved her mother best.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days that Allison was coming home, Haile was always on
Cloud 9,'' Shanks said.
</P>
<P>
   Avinesh Amit Deo, Avinash ``A.V.'' Prasad and Anjesh Prasad
</P>
<P>
   AvineshAmit Deo, 23, was scheduled to start his first day on the
first job of his first real career Tuesday. Deo, who graduated in
December from ITT Technical Institute, and two cousins,
Avinash``A.V.'' Prasad, 19, and Anjesh Prasad, 19, left Friday for
Puerto Vallarta to celebrate Deo's graduation and the launch of his
new career in computer-aided drafting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so excited about it,'' said Laura Nielsen, director of
career services at ITT, who helped Deo secure his job at All Pro
Power Washing and Coatings in Ballard.
</P>
<P>
   Deo was to begin as an ``estimator'' doing computer-aided
estimates of large construction projects, said Tony Salazar,
general manager of All Pro, who hired him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just shined,'' said Salazar, who was still choking back
tears Tuesday after speaking with Deo's mother. ``He had so much
talent and enthusiasm. He would have become a very fine estimator,
something the industry needs desperately.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family struggled with the shock Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy (Deo) was the only person I ever knew who could bring
a smile to anyone's face,'' said David Shimek, friend of Deo's and
his co-worker at Big 5 Sporting Goods in Burien. ``He knew how to
handle situations, no matter what they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Salazar wanted Deo to start work earlier, but Deo insisted on
giving Big 5 two weeks' notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really struck me,'' Salazar said. ``He was devoted to his
word as an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Deo and his cousins were close, said friends and family members.
All were born in Fiji. Deo's family immigrated in 1995, while
Anjesh Prasad has lived in the U.S. since he was 17 months old.
Avinash Prasad, an only child, moved here with his parents at age
18. The vacation was his first trip away from home.
</P>
<P>
   Avinash Prasad was mourned Tuesday by his co-workers at the
Renton warehouse of HomeGrocer.com where he worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``His nickname was the `Fiji Flash' for his speed on the company
soccer team, said Rick Lessley, director of operations for the
company. Prasad, who had worked for HomeGrocer since October,
scored goals in each of the company's three games so far this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very good-natured with a great sense of humor and a
very strong work ethic,'' Lessley said. ``It's a sad day.
HomeGrocer lost such a fine employee and member of our family.''
</P>
<P>
   Prasad's peers had a moment of silence when they were informed
of the crash Tuesday morning, Lessley said. The company plans to
make counselors available to employees in the wake of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Prasad's cousin, Anjesh Prasad, also loved sports. Anjesh
Prasad, who graduated from Highline High School in 1998, worked for
Horizon Air as a ground service agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three of them were very athletic,'' said Robby Armijo, a
friend of Anjesh Prasad and Deo.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond their athleticism, the young men were known for their
ability to make people smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anjesh was very funny, very bright,'' Armijo said. ``The whole
family are just fine people.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Penna
</P>
<P>
   Allen Temple lost six friends to the Pacific Ocean on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-eyed, brown-haired Deborah Penna, an Cornish College art
student known for her abstract paintings and quiet, thoughtful way,
was among them.
</P>
<P>
   So were Michael Bernard, Ryan Busche, Abigail Busche, James Ryan
and Russell Ing.
</P>
<P>
   Temple met Penna, 27, nine years ago in Chicago, where she
attended school. When Temple moved to Bellingham, she introduced
him around.
</P>
<P>
   Many of their shared friends perished in the Alaska Airlines
flight 216 crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of my crew is basically in the ocean right now,'' said
Temple, 28, a student at Bellingham Technical College who gathered
with friends Tuesday night to sort out their grief.
</P>
<P>
   Of his six friends aboard the flight, Temple knew Penna the
longest. Her paintings, including a portrait of her boyfriend
Charles, hang in Temple's Bellingham home.
</P>
<P>
   ``She expressed herself through her art,'' said Temple. ``Debbie
was a pretty soft-spoken person but when she did speak she had a
lot to say in a few words. A lot of times she would sit by the
wayside and absorb.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple said he had talked to Penna shortly before her trip to
Mexico, a vacation planned in a celebration of a James Ryan's
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very excited to hang out in another country,'' said
Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Part of her trip included a visit with her boyfriend, Charles
McHale, a University of Washington student working in Mexico on a
building project for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Penna attended art schools in Chicago and New York before
enrolling at Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle. A multi-media
artist, Penna used a variety of materials in her work, from crayon
to hair to plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Painting was her first love,'' said Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Penna expected to graduate in May, said Monica Moe, director of
public relations for Cornish College. Moe called Penna's death
``devastating for a small community like Cornish,'' which currently
enrolls 625 students.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions on a memorial and scholarship for Penna are pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was delightful. Everybody loved Debbie,'' said Diane
Brainard, the owner of Old Town Cafe in Bellingham, where Penna
waitressed three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Brainard recalled how Penna took pains to create the ``please
have a seat sign'' for restaurant customers.
</P>
<P>
   Temple said he is still coming to terms with Penna's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have waves of not believing this happened,'' he said. ``She
was a beautiful person, inside and out.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford Poll
</P>
<P>
   Stanford Poll was a large, loud, robust man who once owned the
J&AMP;M Cafe and Blue Moon tavern in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He swam naked in his pool every morning, blasting jazz and blues
loud enough to startle the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   He talked constantly, chortled like Santa Claus and called his
tanning habit ``going to war with the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He filled up the whole room and when people saw him, they
didn't know if they should fear him or love him,'' said his
daughter, Shaina Poll.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, the 59-year-old Mercer Island man doted on his four
children and his wife, Gabriel. He also ``adopted'' friends and
co-workers into his large extended family, and loved teasing them
with his generous wit.
</P>
<P>
   A passionate fisherman who plied the Alaskan waters, he took his
daughters fishing while they were still in diapers, wrapping Wonder
Bread bags around their feet for waders.
</P>
<P>
   He poured half-and-half in his kids' cereal for a special treat.
And he was so persistently late that his wife finally gave up,
setting back their clocks by two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a small boy in a very, very big body,'' said Sasha
Poll, another daughter. ``We called him Peter Pan.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Shaina: ``He could take anything in life and enjoy it, and
he showed you how to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   He never finished college, but excelled in business, owning a
fashion school, pizza parlor, video arcade and other bars. In the
'70s, while running the J&AMP;M on First Avenue, he helped launch the
restoration of Pioneer Square.
</P>
<P>
   At the J&AMP;M, he wooed his future wife, then a cocktail waitress.
</P>
<P>
   He loved Mexico and wanted to retire near its sparkling blue
water. He took his family to Puerto Vallarta every spring, but this
time, he went alone to relax for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Poll was supposed to come home Wednesday, but he missed his wife
so much he hopped on an early flight.
</P>
<P>
   Linda and Joe Knight
</P>
<P>
   During a vacation to Puerto Vallarta two years ago, Linda Knight
was shocked to see the deplorable conditions of families living in
the tourist city's dump.
</P>
<P>
   She began ``Mission in Mexico,'' which used donations to
establish a program to provide food and clean water to more than 75
children and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Knight, 51, and her husband Joe, 54, co-pastors at The
Rock Church in Monroe, north of Seattle, were returning from a
humanitarian trip to Puerto Vallarta Monday when their plane
crashed off the coast of California.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday their two children, daughter-in-law and the church's
other pastors came together under the large wooden cross in the
modest sanctuary to share memories of the Knights with the media.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the congregation sat in pews at the back, giving
words of encouragement to the family, sniffling and daubing red
eyes. The front of the church was decorated with flowers and U.S.
flags _ Joe Knight had served in the Vietnam War, Linda Knight was
a Sioux Indian, and both were patriotic.
</P>
<P>
   Openly weeping, friends and family said they viewed the deaths
of the church's founders not as an ending, but as a new start to
expand their mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``These weren't just two passengers on an airplane,'' said the
Knights' 29-year-old son, Jeff, a youth pastor at the church.
``These were two people who were affecting the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Jenny Lynn, a 16-year-old student at Monroe High
School, said their parents were supportive of youth in the
community, always willing to take them in or lend an ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only have I lost my family ... but I've lost two of the
closest people in my life,'' she said, breaking into tears.
</P>
<P>
   The Knights began their nondenominational church with Bible
study classes in their Skykomish home in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   As membership grew, they found larger locations, eventually
opening the church in Monroe in 1993. There are now approximately
400 adult and youth members. The congregation is diverse, with
ranging from drug addicts to cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're non-church people,'' said George Parker, another
pastor at The Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Knight recalled that his parents, who married in January
1968, had some rocky years, but when they dedicated their lives to
Jesus Christ more than two decades ago, it turned their lives
around.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said they opened their doors to people who ``were broken
... hopeless,'' not unlike the state the Knights were in before
they became Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The Knights, longtime horse lovers, even reached out to the
cowboy community, holding regular Sunday night services at their
ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very relaxed,'' said Paul Jerome, a pastor from the Red
Rock Cowboy Church, also in Monroe. ``(People) sit in the barn on
hay and hear the word of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Accessibility and community outreach were a cornerstone of The
Rock Church, making the impact of the Knights' deaths more
profoundly felt by the rural community.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very shocked,'' said Parker. ``Kids are very angry.
They don't understand why did it happen to such a great couple.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jeff Knight held onto his optimism for the future of the
church. When asked what his parents would say if they could see the
scene yesterday in the sanctuary, he replied, ``Mom would say,
`Hoka hey!'''
</P>
<P>
   Church members applauded as Knight explained that the words were
the battle cry for Sioux warrior Crazy Horse.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase translates, ``It is a good day to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Stasinos and Charlene Sipe
</P>
<P>
   Harry Stasinos sold insurance policies to businesses and
homeowners and dreamed about starting his own agency some day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a jovial kind of guy, good natured,'' said John Fuller,
owner of Prime Insurance in Lynnwood, north of Seattle, where
Stasinos worked for just over a year. ``He always enjoyed having a
good time. A trip to Mexico would not be unsual for Harry.''
</P>
<P>
   Traveling companion Charlene Sipe, a Seattle insurance agent who
lived with Stasinos, also died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Stasinos worked several years for the Roy Potter Insurance
Agency in Seattle. He left fulltime work at the agency in late
1996, though he kept his license there and continued writing
policies, said Connie Davis, another agent.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Stasinos moved to Olympia to work for the flood-insurance
program managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Stasinos was an only child, close to his family. ``He was a very
nice man,'' Davis said.

 &HT;    Gore appeals to `retail' vote in N.H.
 &HT;    By Scott Shepard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Manchester, N.H. _ When Al Gore discovered last fall that he had
fallen behind Bill Bradley in the polls in New Hampshire, he looked
for a way to break out of the vice presidential cocoon and to reach
voters in a personal, unscripted way.
</P>
<P>
   He found it in the series of open meetings that began last
October and ended Monday night, just hours before New Hampshire
voters went to the polls in the nation's first presidential primary
balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Gore isn't the first presidential candidate to hold such
meetings in New Hampshire, a state long known for its ``retail''
politics in which the candidates must get up close and personal
with voters.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the Republican presidential contest, Sen. John
McCain of Arizona, has held 114 open meetings in the Granite State
since declaring his candidacy last year, a number that eclipses
Gore's 12 open meetings by far.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's open meetings have been especially open-ended, many
of them lasting for more than three hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll stay as long as you want, as long as somebody has a
question,'' Gore usually says at the start of his meetings. And he
does, even when only a handful of voters remain, either to ask him
a question, get an autograph or take a photo of him.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Gore will take questions from the audience for about 90
minutes. Then, if it appears the audience is tiring, he will wrap
up the formal question-and-answer session. But he will remain in
place until everyone who approaches him has had their chance to
question him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the questions can be pretty tough,'' said David Broder of
The Washington Post, the unofficial ``dean'' of political
reporters, as he watched Gore at an open meeting in Lebanon, N.H.,
on the final weekend of campaigning in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one voter there expressed dismay over Gore's infamous
fund-raising visit to a Buddhist temple during the 1996
Clinton-Gore re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake,'' Gore conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike campaign debate audiences or open meetings with
presidents, the voters who come to Gore's open meetings in New
Hampshire have not been screened.
</P>
<P>
   And as a result, the meetings can take a turn that is
unanticipated, either by the candidate or his staff.
</P>
<P>
   In Amherst on Monday night, for example, among the 300 people
attending the meeting were the parents of a Nashua woman killed by
a man who used the Internet to find out all about her.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Boyer told Gore he was the only presidential candidate who
returned his phone calls regarding the death of his daughter, Amy
Boyer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton shifted to voter forums in the 1992 New Hampshire race
in order to escape the barrage of questions from reporters about
Gennifer Flowers, his attempts to dodge the Vietnam military draft
and his use of marijuana. The voters did not ask such questions.
</P>
<P>
   But for Gore, the use of such forums has turned one of his
biggest weaknesses _ his tendency to talk at length about policy
issues _ into a strength. The voters rarely complain that he is
being long-winded.
</P>
<P>
   The forums also showcase Gore's sense of humor, which has been
largely hidden from public view.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, for example, Gore sneezed in the middle of someone's
question. His body microphone, which had gone dead earlier, was
activated and filled the auditorium with the amplified sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the microphone works,'' Gore quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Gore likes the give-and-take of these meetings. He used to hold
up to 10 in a weekend when he was in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use to call him the open meetings king,'' said House
Democratic Whip David Bonior of Michigan, who served with Gore in
the House in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   And if he's elected president, Gore says, ``I'll be doing these
kinds of meetings again.''

   In the mix: Al Gore hands out coffee Tuesday in Nashua, N.H., in
a crowd of supporters of various candidates.
</P>

STUDENTS STRUGGLE TO UNDERSTAND DEATH OF CLASSMATES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SEATTLE _ In the outsized printed letters of a first-grade
student, Rachel Pearson wrote down her dream for the new
millennium: that it would snow every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we could make snowmen and play with friends outside every
day,'' the 6-year-old wrote in a January class assignment, still
posted on the wall at John Hay Elementary Tuesday. ``That would be
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just one heartbreaking reminder at the small Queen Anne
school as staff, parents, and students absorbed the thought that
Rachel and three of her classmates would never see their dreams
come true.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel and classmates Blake, Miles, and Coriander Clemetson were
aboard the Alaska Airlines flight that crashed Monday off
California. Coriander was one of 78 second-graders at the school;
the other three were among the 82 first-graders. The two families
were friends who were vacationing together.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Public Schools staff knew that, with 47 Seattle
residents aboard the flight, they might feel the ripples. The crash
``makes our big city a small town,'' Superintendent Joseph
Olchefske said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the thought that one school could be hit four times
seemed unspeakably cruel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts are aching,'' Hay Principal Joanne Testa-Cross said
at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members and parents were briefed by child psychologists at
Hay Tuesday, and teachers spent time in their classrooms talking
with students about their missing classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult, very, very painful for the staff.
They're having to deal with their own grief, and then the real
challenge of having to explain it to all these kids,'' said
Olchefske, whose own daughter attends kindergarten at Hay.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a lot of kids where these were their best
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Student reactions ranged from technical questions about the
flight to writing letters to their lost friends to simply saying
``I miss them,'' Testa-Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   Others drew pictures. ``I saw an airplane that had `Heaven'
written on it, with a phone number,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The loss wasn't isolated to the school, but was woven in the
entire Queen Anne community.
</P>
<P>
   Families know each other ``from the playground, from the
preschool, from the bagel shop, from just being neighbors,'' said
Glenn Baker, who counted David Clemetson _ father of Blake, Miles
and Coriander _ as his closest friend. Baker went mountain biking
with Clemetson and Rodney Pearson _ Rachel's dad _ and another
friend every Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said his friends told him last week that they were
skipping the tradition this past Sunday because of their Puerto
Vallarta trip.
</P>
<P>
   Baker remembers telling Clemetson that he wished the flights
would be cancelled so they could keep their regular date.
</P>
<P>
   All the Clemetsons were ``so colorful and so full of life,''
Baker said, and David Clemetson, especially, was ``super, super
playful.''
</P>
<P>
   All four of the Hay students aboard the flight ``were smiling,
wonderful children,'' Testa-Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   As the Coast Guard search was still active Tuesday, teachers
didn't talk about death, but instead explained that the search is
ongoing but that no survivors have been found. Psychologists will
be available at the school at least through next week.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard for Carol Briant, a friend of the Clemetsons and
Pearsons, to explain the news to her own daughter, who also attends
Hay and wanted to know who would feed the Clemetson's dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most difficult part is knowing they can't
understand fully. It comes to them in little bits, in little
bubbles,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The school looked almost normal from the outside Tuesday, with
cut-out paper snowflakes and flowers taped to windows. Inside, the
pictures and student work adorned the hallway, where staff members
and parents embraced and exchanged tears.
</P>
<P>
   At one end of the hall, a collection of brown construction paper
owls showed that second-grade students had learned the vowel sound
``ow.'' One had Coriander Clemetson's name printed on it, dated
just last week.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, accompanying Rachel Pearson's millennium
essay, was a smiling photo of the gap-toothed girl, along with her
crayon illustration _ two girls in red shirts waving their arms in
joy at a shower of snow.

 EVEN AMID CHANGES, COWBOYS MAINTAIN STATUS QUO
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By RAY BUCK c.2000 Fort
Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys found a way to achieve necessary
change and status quo at the same time yesterday by promoting
secondary coach Mike Zimmer to defensive coordinator and bringing
back Jack Reilly, who worked closely with Troy Aikman as
quarterbacks coach in 1997, to serve as offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   The ``familiarity factor'' is being espoused as a critical part
of owner Jerry Jones' plan to get the Cowboys back into Super Bowl
contention while Aikman and Emmitt Smith are still an integral part
of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Less than one week after Dave Campo succeeded Chan Gailey as
head coach _ an in-house maneuver to promote defensive continuity
and to assure as much staff stability as can be expected from a
coaching change _ the Cowboys introduced Campo's two new
coordinators yesterday at Valley Ranch. They are:
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer, 43, who will be entering his seventh season with the
Cowboys. He has been their secondary coach since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, 54, who spent the past two seasons as quarterbacks coach
at New England. He sought and received permission last week from
the Patriots, who fired Pete Carroll and have since hired Bill
Belichick, to be interviewed by the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Neither appointment came as much of a surprise to anyone closely
watching the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Both Reilly and Zimmer were the first choices of both Jones and
Campo. No other interviews were conducted for the jobs of either
head coach, offensive coordinator or defensive coordinator,
according to Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``By promoting \RCampo and Zimmer\S from within, and having Jack
Reilly come on, there is very good familiarity here,'' Jones said.
``We haven't missed a lick as it pertains to evaluating personnel.
We could make a decision on a free-agent receiver ``tonight'', if
need be, and I would be very comfortable with that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly has vowed to return the Cowboys' offense to a ``very
aggressive style, both in throwing the ball and running the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer, who isn't afraid to ``motivate'' players by getting on
them, has assured that he will bring his own ``personality'' to a
defense that won't need to undergo many changes at all.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, mum is the word about other inevitable staff changes. It
appears that four offensive coaches brought in by Gailey two years
ago _ Buddy Geis, Dwaine Painter, Les Miles and Tommie Robinson _
will be let go in the absence of any reassurance from Jones in all
four cases. Painter is the only one without a contract for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Zampese, former Cowboys offensive coordinator (1994-97)
and Reilly's boss each of the past three seasons at Dallas and New
England, is expected to join the Cowboys in an advisory capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible,'' Jones said yesterday. ``But we don't have
that ironed out.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Cowboys were making news at Valley Ranch yesterday,
the Miami Dolphins hired Gailey to be offensive coordinator. Gailey
was fired Jan. 11 after serving only two seasons of a five-year
contract as Cowboys' head coach/offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake two years ago,'' Jones conceded yesterday.
``I really thought that if we came in with something completely
new, it would be fresh and there would be a lot of energy \Rby the
players\S in learning something new.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it resulted in the Cowboys going from the NFL's
eighth-ranked offense, a 10-6 record the NFC East title in Gailey's
first season to the NFL's 16th-ranked offense, an 8-8 record and a
wild-card spot this past season.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly has the confidence of Aikman, who already has met with
his new offensive coordinator over lunch this past week, and has
been on the phone with him as well.
</P>
<P>
   This offense has been brought back for Aikman, as much as for
anyone on the Cowboys. Reilly believes that the 33-year-old
quarterback is the right man for what is being counted on to be the
right offense for the Cowboys in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Troy looks as good as anytime in his whole career,''
Reilly said. ``He's still accurate and effective ... and he's
really excited about playing \Rin this offense\S. That's the whole
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly was on the same Los Angeles Raiders team with Rocket
Ismail in 1994. Plus, Reilly knows players such as Smith, David
LaFleur, Eric Bjornson and most of the offensive linemen from his
first tour of duty with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been drafting players who fit into what we do here,''
Zimmer said of the continuity factor. ``Dexter Coakley is a great
player ... for us. Likewise, if we \Rcoaches\S all of sudden tried
switching to, say, the Jets' two-gap style of defense, it would
require a transition period of one year, maybe two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, we won't have that.''

 RANGERS, LOAIZA AGREE ON CONTRACT (For use
by NYTimes News Service clients) By T.R. SULLIVAN c.2000 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers avoided an arbitration hearing
with pitcher Esteban Loaiza when he agreed to a one-year contract
yesterday worth $2.65 million plus incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza was seeking $3.3 million from arbitration while the
Rangers offered $2.5 million. The hearing was scheduled for Monday
in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to get it done and get everything settled before we
break to camp,'' Loaiza said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers don't expect to settle with first
baseman//designated hitter Lee Stevens. General manager Doug Melvin
said there have been no negotiations with agent Alan Nero since the
two sides filed their numbers two weeks ago. A hearing is scheduled
for Feb. 18 in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably going to be a tough one to get settled,''
Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens has asked for $4.7 million, and the Rangers offered $3.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers haven't had an arbitration hearing since catcher
Ivan Rodriguez in 1996. Melvin said there was a point where he
thought they wouldn't get a deal done with Loaiza until both sides
compromised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking forward to him pitching the way he did the
second half last year,'' Melvin said. ``He's always had the arm,
it's just a matter of him putting it together for a whole year. He
hasn't done that since 1997. He knows that, and that's what his
goal should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza agreed, saying, ``That's what I expected last year, it
just didn't go that way from spring training. This year will be a
different story.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza was 9-4 with a 3.72 earned-run average after the All-Star
break last year after spending the first half in the bullpen and on
the disabled list with a broken hand.
</P>
<P>
   He was expected to be in the rotation, but lost his job in
spring training to Mike Morgan. Manager Johnny Oates has already
said that Loaiza will be in the Rangers' rotation this year based
on what he did in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really glad I have his confidence back,'' Loaiza said.
``The way I pitched in the second half and in postseason, he knows
what my numbers are as a starter. I'm ready to go.'' Sele to miss
banquet Pitcher Aaron Sele will not be present Friday night at the
Rangers' mid-winter banquet to receive his Pitcher of the Year
Award. Sele, who signed with the Seattle Mariners last month, told
the Rangers he wanted to come but the Mariners' mid-winter carnival
is also this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher John Burkett, who signed with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays,
is expected to attend and accept his Harold McKinney Good Guy
Award. Tickets on sale Rangers individual game tickets will be on
sale this weekend at Rangers ticket outlets or by calling (817)
273-5100. The Ballpark in Arlington ticket offices will be open in
conjunction with the Rangers' mid-winter carnival from 9 a.m. to 6
p.m. Saturday and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday. Tickets can also be
purchased at all Rangers ETM machines located in Tom Thumb stores,
at the Reunion Arena box office and at the Rangers' Web site,
www.texasrangers.com.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday, individual game tickets will not go on sale again
until sometime in March.

 PERSONAL TRAGEDY STRENGTHENS TULSA'S COLEY
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By WHIT CANNING c.2000
Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULSA, Okla. _ When Tulsa opened the season at Rhode Island in
November, senior forward Eric Coley led the Golden Hurricane to an
impressive 91-66 victory by scoring 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those in the arena had no way of knowing, of course,
that Coley had just stepped off a plane ... joining the team late
after staying behind to serve as a pallbearer at his cousin's
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   For the 17th-ranked Golden Hurricane _ 20-2 overall and 5-1 in
Western Athletic Conference play going into this week's games with
SMU and TCU _ it was the start of what has been a scintillating
season. Tulsa is deep and versatile, and when asked, coach Bill
Self can provide a succinct evaluation of each of his team's key
players.
</P>
<P>
   Of Coley, he says simply, ``He's the toughest person I've ever
coached.''
</P>
<P>
   While Coley is tough enough on the court, that really isn't what
Self is talking about. His cousin's recent suicide was only the
latest in a string of tragedies that have left Coley, at age 22,
sadly wise beyond his years and a bit wary of the dawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``After everything that has happened,'' he said, ``I honestly
believe that I have found some peace with myself. I have been able
to focus more on the game, and I think I am playing better. I have
sort of gotten into an attitude that nothing can hurt me anymore. I
have begun to look positively at the future and believe that things
will get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel at peace ... but I still sometimes sit and wonder,
`What could happen next?' ''
</P>
<P>
   For Coley, the ordeal started more than two years ago when his
mother began an agonizing battle with cancer. Her death and the
pain she suffered left him devastated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just such a terrible thing,especially, I think, when
you watch people go through chemotherapy and radiation treatments
and realize it's as bad as the disease itself,'' he said. ``I've
finally learned to accept it ... but it's something I'll never
forget. It's something no one should have to deal with when they're
young.
</P>
<P>
   ``But everyone at the school was great about it. Coach Self told
me to come to practice if I felt like it, or to stay away, if I
didn't feel like it. `Do whatever you have to do,' he said. They
told me to come to class if I felt like it, or take the year off if
that's what I needed. Everyone at the school was really great.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came another setback. An uncle, who had a young son, was
given a diagnosis of cancer and eventually died. Coley began
driving more than an hour home to Eufaula, Okla., every day after
school to be with his nephew, then driving back the next day. He
developed anemia, and missed four games in his sophomore season
(1997-98).
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of it all, Coley and his longtime girlfriend had a
son _ Eric Jr. _ and were raising a child while finishing their
degrees. Now, another uncle has been found to have leukemia, and
Coley admits that it is impossible to ignore the fact that ``on my
mother's side of the family, nine of 14 siblings have either died
of cancer or been operated on for it. It's something you try not to
think about, but it's not going to go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then came the news about my cousin. It was just a total shock,
because all through that time with my mother, he was the one who
comforted me. I leaned on him constantly, and he was the strong one
who was always there when I needed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the 6-foot-5 Coley has managed to become one of
the most versatile and effective players in the nation, a leader
whom Self said ``can dominate a game without scoring a point.''
</P>
<P>
   He is scoring 11.2 points per game, but they come in spurts,
when needed. He ranks fifth on a team with five players averaging
in double figures, but leads the team in rebounds (6.2) and steals
(3.1). He is second in blocked shots (1.2) and third in assists
(3.1). When he scores five more points, he will become the only
Tulsa player besides Shea Seals to finish a career with at least
1,000 points, 500 rebounds and 200 steals. He also has 117 blocks,
second best in school history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say I should score more,but I think there are pro
teams out there who would value someone who plays defense, runs the
court, and works at it all _a blue-collar player,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As blue collar as they come. Moving from Rochester, N.Y., to
Eufaula when he was 13, Coley developed another love: He now owns
three horses and is an accomplished calf roper, with ideas about
trying the professional rodeo circuit if pro ball doesn't pan out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is, he's a warrior,'' Self said. ``Really and
truly, a warrior, who comes and gives his best every day. He has
had to learn that tragic things happen to people every day, and you
put your faith in God and move on. After what he's endured, I don't
see how any of the rest of us can say we had it rough.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the heart of a warrior, there remains an ache for those
who are gone. There have been so many, it even extends to the
living ... such as Michael Ruffin, now with the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week, I changed the message on the phone in the
apartment,'' Coley said. ``It no longer says, `Hi, you've reached
Eric Coley and Mike Ruffin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally took Mike's name off.''

 FANS CAN GET INVOLVED IN RECRUITING NEWS (For
use by NYTimes News Service clients) By TOMMY CUMMINGS c.2000 Fort
Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Rivals.com couldn't have asked for a better
showcase for its mission than today's national signing day.
</P>
<P>
   Experts acknowledge it. Statistics confirm it.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Burton is editor of Rivals100.com, one of nearly 500
fan-based sites networked by Seattle-based Rivals.com. Burton
provided recruiting commentary to ESPN.com and to Fox Sports Net
before joining Rivals.com.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of Rivals.com _ in which hundreds of fan sites for
professional, college and high school athletic teams are linked _
appealed to Burton, who assembles his site in Austin. Burton was
also drawn by the independent discussion and feedback available on
Rivals.com sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a major strength,'' said Burton, whose site plans to be
host for a marathon chat with top recruits and other Rivals.com
recruiting analysts from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team sites on Rivals.com bring together publishers who are
passionate about the universities they cover,'' Burton said.
``That's what makes community-driven sites more popular; people are
able to make them what they want to be.
</P>
<P>
   Since its launch in August, a lot of people have been making
Rivals.com a stop _ a long stop. According to the
Nielsen/NetRatings for December, Rivals.com emerged as the Web's
No. 1 ``stickiest'' sports site _ with ``stickiest'' meaning the
average time the site appears on a screen per visit.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ratings, Rival.com users accessed the site for
an average of 1 hour, 5 minutes and 58 seconds, far longer than
big-media sites ESPN.com (21:18) and CBS SportsLine (12:03).
E-commerce king, E-Bay, was the No. 1 non-sports site with a stay
of 1:42.43.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of Rival.com's popularity in December came during
recruiting periods. That should translate into big numbers for the
January ratings.
</P>
<P>
   It's what founder Jim Heckman had in mind when he created
Rivals.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the new media, the fans want to be in charge of the
information,'' Heckman said. ``They don't want to go to ESPN or CBS
SportsLine and be told what is news.''
</P>
<P>
   Other sites try the portal technique, specifically About.com,
which pays guides an advertising-based commission to gather sites
of similar interests.
</P>
<P>
   But Heckman, who once authored the University of Washington fans
magazine, tried a different approach. With $30 million in backers
such as Intel and News America Digital Publishing (Fox), Heckman
went after experts who had a made a name for themselves in other
media.
</P>
<P>
   Heckman recruited Burton, who started tracking the business of
finding out where young athletes decide to play sports in 1993 as
editor of The National Recruiting Advisor, which published a
monthly newsletter and produced a 900 telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   Other recruiting experts from across the country joined in.
Earlier this week, Rivals.com bridged a potential information gap
by hiring Maxey Parrish, former Baylor sports information director
and former College Sports Information Director of America
president, as a liaison between the company and sports athletic
departments. Parrish plans to continue working out of his home in
Waco while teaching part time at Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's site is like the others in the Rivals.com community.
Rival.com's technology allows publishers to input information
without having to program or design a site.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ease of navigation and a cookie-cutter look, Burton
said it all comes back to content.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Rivals.com, you're not getting one side to a story,'' he
said. ``You're getting opinions from hundreds and hundreds of
writers.''  &LR; subheds:Bytes On-ice chat: ESPN.com and NHL.com plan
another first at the NHL All-Star Game on Sunday when they'll offer
users to their sites an opportunity to chat with players while play
is in progress. On Jan. 9, ESPN2 on-air hosts and analysts answered
ESPN.com user questions during the Colorado-Chicago game. More than
10,000 questions were submitted by more than 17,000 unique users,
according to ESPN.com

AND SO JUST WHAT GOOD WERE THE GOOD OLD DAYS?

<P>
   It's only right for governors, presidential candidates and
mayors to demand that schools improve. In a democracy, elected
leaders should hold public schools accountable. But if politicians
don't properly inform themselves about complex educational
problems, they risk making decisions by cliche.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is the recent State of the State speech by Gov.
George Pataki of New York. Explaining his demands for reform, the
governor said, ``At the turn of the last century, New York's
schools provided immigrant children and native New Yorkers alike
with a first-rate education,'' whereas today ``some students are
forced to settle for less.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words may have struck many as harmless hyperbole. But
allusions to a nonexistent golden age can be harmful, by masking
the challenges schools actually face.
</P>
<P>
   In the first decades of the 20th century, there was a yawning
achievement gap between immigrants and the American-born. Even
immigrant Jews, whom many now consider yesteryear's ``model
minority,'' did worse in school than immigrants do today. Schools
took years to lift the children of immigrants up to achievement
levels we now take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1911 federal report, 80 percent of native white
seventh-graders of that period in cities like Boston, Chicago and
New York made it into eighth grade the next year. But a smaller
proportion of Russian Jewish immigrant children, and many fewer
Southern Italian immigrants, did so. After eighth grade, Southern
Italians made it to high school at only half the rate of their
native peers. (For purposes of the report, children were considered
immigrants if they or their fathers were foreign-born.)
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, things weren't much better. By the end of
the 1920s, Italian immigrant high school students were still
graduating at only one-quarter the rate of nonimmigrants. This was
a much bigger native-immigrant gap than today's.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrant Jews performed less well than native whites, but
better than immigrant Italians. That was no surprise. Then as now,
achievement had a lot to do with families' economic status. In
1910, one in three Southern Italian adult men in American big
cities, and almost no Russian Jews, were unskilled laborers. In
contrast, one in three Russian Jews, and very few Southern
Italians, were merchants. As a result, Russian Jewish immigrants
averaged about 20 percent more family income than Southern Italian
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Social promotion was hardly the norm back then. The term
``retarded,'' for children deemed to have limited ability, comes
from the early-20th-century practice of holding back (retarding)
those who read below grade level. A 1909 study found that in New
York City, Italian-born elementary students were held back twice as
frequently as American-born children. Jewish and Irish students
were also retained unusually often.
</P>
<P>
   Once denied promotion, many were quick to drop out. The
immigrant challenge was so daunting that New York City started a
special education program to address it. A 1921 survey found
Italian children greatly overrepresented in these separate classes
for slow learners.
</P>
<P>
   Standardized exams seemed to confirm immigrants' inferiority.
About this time, IQ tests became common. In 1919, the median IQ
score of Italian 10-year-olds in New York City was 84; for
native-born whites, it was 109. But when only those students whose
fathers were unskilled or semiskilled laborers were compared,
Italian and native IQ's were nearly identical.
</P>
<P>
   Progress was slow, and assimilation rates for subsequent
generations varied by ethnicity. It seems that Jews typically
adapted to schools and became fully fluent in English more quickly
than other immigrant groups. Italians seemed to do so more quickly
than Greeks.
</P>
<P>
   But of immigrant children themselves, even Jews were mostly
unsuccessful. The 1911 report found that about half of all Jewish
immigrant children around the country were held back in school.
(Jews from Poland did particularly poorly; two-thirds were held
back.) The historian Irving Howe reviewed New York school documents
from 1910 to 1914 and said he had become ``impatient with later
sentimentalists'' who exaggerated how much Jewish immigrant
children ``burned with zeal'' for their studies. The academically
successful were a minority.
</P>
<P>
   Is this relevant to today's problems? Yes, because we need
reminding that the past provides models of very limited value.
Americans now do a better (and more nearly equal) job of educating
immigrant children than did Americans of earlier eras.
</P>
<P>
   Our education debates could benefit from greater humility. We
should aspire for greater success in educating immigrants, but
nobody has sure answers for how to achieve it. If reform-minded
politicians think better schools are simply a matter of turning
back the clock, we've got big disappointments ahead.

 MEMORY OF STEWART HANGS OVER PEBBLE BEACH
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By JOHNNY PAUL c.2000
Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Waves from Monterey Bay crashed upon the
nearby shoreline. Blades of damp grass glistened from the
California sun's bright rays.
</P>
<P>
   Tranquility embraced Pebble Beach Golf Links' 18th green in the
manner it influenced the life of the late Payne Stewart, recalled
his friend and 1999 Ryder Cup teammate, Tom Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who died Oct. 25 in an airplane accident, will be the
subject of many conversations this week. He was last year's
champion of the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. Lehman chose a
most picturesque and peaceful setting yesterday afternoon for his
remembrance of Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really seem to feel, in knowing him and having observed him
over the past few years, that he was savoring his life well before
the U.S. Open,'' Lehman said in reference to Stewart's victory at
the major championship in June. ``He only got to savor that for
four months, but he seemed to be savoring a real contentment and
peace in his life that he had for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of peace, the Bible says, surpasses all
understanding. It's an incredible thing, and to have that in your
life is without a question the greatest gift of all. He seemed to
have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Professional golf and those who share a passion for it treasured
the flamboyant Stewart, a confident showman who donned knickers and
tam-o'-shanters and possessed the talent to match his flashy sense
of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when I was flying in here the other day, I thought,
`Gosh, I remember him on the phone last year,' '' said Mark
O'Meara, who telephoned Stewart to congratulate him on his 1999
victory at Pebble Beach, ``and just wishing that he could be here
to defend his championship.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, though, will be no different from any other this year
on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have a tournament this year without honoring Payne
Stewart,'' Davis Love III said. ``It's going to be right there in
front of us this year, which is very good. I know that Paul Azinger
was as thrilled with his win \Rat the Sony Open in Hawaii\S and
getting back into the winner's circle as he was being able to honor
his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like nothing better than to win this golf tournament.
I might not be able to say anything on Sunday afternoon, but
whoever wins this week is going to feel something really special.
We think about him all the time. He's going to be somebody we're
going to miss for a really long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pro-Am paid its tribute to Stewart by observing a moment of
silence yesterday during the Past Champions Shootout. Its annual
youth clinic, presented by AT&AMP;T, will be named the Payne Stewart
Youth Clinic, and tournament marshals will wear tam-o'-shanters
during play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Payne is in a very good place now, and I know he's
probably looking down on all of us wishing he could be here,''
O'Meara said. ``I know after he won here last year, even with the
rain delay and everything, that he was so excited because this was
a tournament he always wanted to win. To have his name on the
trophy and to know that he won at Pebble Beach meant a lot to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   That will not be forgotten this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a week that Payne would be defending,'' Lehman
said. ``I'm sure his family at home knows that, too. I'm sure
there's an added sense of grief that he's not here able to defend.
My heart goes out to them, and so does everyone's here. We dearly
wish to have him back.''

 &HT;    McCain stomps Bush in New Hampshire
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett and Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ John McCain crushed George W. Bush in
Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, giving his insurgent presidential
campaign some vital momentum and puncturing the Texas governor's
aura of inevitability.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic race, Vice President Al Gore pulled off a
narrow victory over Bill Bradley in a contest that had been too
close to call. Late Tuesday evening, Gore led Bradley 52 percent to
47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to march all the way down the field from state to
state and coast to coast,'' Gore said before leaving for a 2 a.m.
airport rally in New York.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's margin of victory was far wider than anyone expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but be amazed by the size of this,'' McCain
said. ``It's across the board. It came from all sectors _
conservatives, moderates, liberals, women.''
</P>
<P>
   With 83 percent of the polls reporting, McCain had captured 49
percent of the vote to 31 percent for Bush. Millionaire publisher
Steve Forbes, radio commentator Alan Keyes and former Reagan aide
Gary Bauer were far behind.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won in every age, income and education group. He won
among men and women, Protestants and Catholics, young and old, rich
and poor. He was well ahead among independents in a state that
allows its non-partisan voters to cast ballots in either primary.
</P>
<P>
   And the Arizona senator defeated Bush among Republican voters, a
constituency Bush had expected to dominate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush conceded at 8:20 p.m at Saint Anselm College in Goffstown.
Twenty minutes later, McCain walked into the ballroom at the Nashua
Crowne Plaza, which has served as his headqurater for the past
week.
</P>
<P>
   He spotted Bud Day, the Air Force colonel who was McCain's first
cellmate in prison in Hanoi. McCain, a Navy pilot who spent 5 1/2
years as a POW, snapped a smart salute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the Republican party has recovered its heritage of
reform,'' McCain told his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good thing, my friends. A good thing. And this is
the beginning of the end ... for the truth-twisting politics of
Bill Clinton and Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain attributed his victory to his message of changing a
culture in Washington ``that for too long has put special interests
above the national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   With the race now moving on to a wider arena, Republican
strategists say the question is whether McCain can propel this
victory into a legitimate challenge. Next comes Delaware next week
and then South Carolina, which holds its primary Feb. 19. Another
11 states will hold GOP primaries on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Bush has been considered the front-runner because of
his staggering lead in campaign funds and his many endorsements
from Republican Party officials. Last week, he also handily won the
Iowa caucuses, which McCain skipped.
</P>
<P>
   Bush looked sad at moments as he conceded Tuesday night but
seemed undaunted. And he vowed to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire has long been known as a bump in the road for
front-runners and this year will be no exception,'' Bush said.
``The road to the Republican nomination is a long road. Mine will
go through all 50 states and I intend for it to end at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go to the next state and the next state and the
next state until I win my party's nomination,'' Bush said. ``And
then I'm going to unite our party and lead us to victory. ... It's
a long haul. I'm a patient man.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' third place finish makes it even more difficult for him
to establish himself as the GOP conservative standard-bearer,
especially in light of the vast amounts of time and money he spent
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' showing was close to the 12 percent he gained in New
Hampshire four years ago. And it was well under the 20 percent he
had predicted he would win after his solid second-place showing
last week in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   With Forbes digging deep into his own personal fortune, his
campaign says he still has the money _ and the message _ to keep
his candidacy going into the next round of primaries. And, they
say, McCain's decisive victory opens the field to any number of
outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our big problem in New Hampshire has been stripping
conservative voters from Bush,'' said Greg Mueller, the Forbes'
campaign communications director. ``A lot of people voted for him
because they thought he was the inevitable candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's loss ``opens up the whole conservative field,''
Mueller added. ``It will be tough, but doable.''
</P>
<P>
   The close contest on the Democratic side assured that Bradley
will stay in the race until at least March 7, when Democratic
voters in New York, California and 13 other states cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Independent analysts had said a loss could be lethal to Bradley,
coming a week after his defeat in the Iowa caucuses by a 2-1
margin.
</P>
<P>
   But with Tuesday night's close race and the money to carry on _
Bradley has more than Gore _ Bradley can continue to pster Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's advisers have maintained he can withstand a close
defeat in New Hampshire, partly because he appears to be strong in
New York, where he is well-known as a former star for the New York
Knicks basketball team. Bradley also believes he has at least a
shot at winning California, where he has shown strength in
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two hours before the polls closed, Bradley released a
letter in which he challenged Gore to weekly debates beginning
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``These debates will provide a useful roadmap to the voters as
to where the Democratic Party will take the country in this new
century,'' Bradley wrote in the letter, addressed, ``Dear Al.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser insisted the proposal was
different from one Gore made in December, challenging Bradley to
twice weekly debates if they both agreed to refrain from television
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley called that offer a ``stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity to have an ongoing discussion with a
large number of voters,'' Hauser said. ``The vice president has
wanted to debate. ... We'd be surprised if he didn't embrace it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley suggested that the first debate take place on NBC's
``Meet the Press'' this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore predicted his victory would ripple well beyond the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he cannot win here, then that's a devastating blow to
him,'' the vice president said of Bradley in a conference call to
Midwestern governors. ``We were behind in the polls for 14 weeks,
so this is one where we fought our way back on the strength of the
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The night clearly belonged to McCain, though.
</P>
<P>
   A huge cheer went up at his hotel headquarters in Nashua when
CNN declared him the winner just after the polls closed at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Easily! Easily!'' shouted Barbara West, a retiree from
Concord. ``Everyone's going to look at him in a different light
now.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's sons, Jack and Jimmy, danced with joy, while Cindy
McCain, his wife, put her hand to her mouth and wept.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dante Scala, a professor in the politics department at St.
Anselm College, was stunned by McCain's margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' he said. ``In a word: Golly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran a classic retail politics, grassroots New Hampshire
campaign, which George Bush did not do,'' Scala said. ``I think
McCain was also the most polished candidate in that he put forth a
very convincing and attractive political persona. His profile as a
war hero, a non-nonsense politician that will reform the system
rang loud and clear to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain's message of returning the government back to the
people is especially appealing to New Hampshire voters. In time of
prosperity, that message had much more traction than a message
about tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Fowler, a Dartmouth College political scientist, called
McCain's victory ``a real repudiation to the front-runner, who has
the backing of the political establishment in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is authentic,'' Fowler said. ``That's the word everybody
uses over and over again. He says what he thinks, and where there
are things he hasn't thought through he lets you know that and you
get some sense of him thinking thngs through with the voters as he
develops positions on things.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, ``didn't come across well on television, and I
don't think the way he chose to present himself in ads really
played to his strength,'' Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who know him and who've met him say he is a real people
person and that he connects well with citizens and he has the
capacity to relate to them. In the ads and debates, whatever that
personal chemistry
</P>
<P>
   is that works one-on-one just wasn't there,'' said Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has basically been saying, 'Make me your president because
I've been a good governor of Texas.' Well Texas isn't New
Hampshire,'' she said.

WOMAN'S SEPTUPLETS DIE DURING MISCARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill.)   (af)  
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Less than a week after a 31-year-old woman
joyously announced to the world that she was pregnant with
septuplets, all seven fetuses died on Monday because of an
infection in her uterus, her doctors said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Ivette Zapata-Smalls of Lakewood, N.J., was in stable
condition Tuesday night after miscarrying the fetuses, which at 19{
weeks were three weeks short of being viable outside the womb.
Citing strong religious beliefs against abortion, Zapata-Smalls and
her husband, Frederick Smalls, had rejected their obstetrician's
advice to abort four or five of the embryos, which would have
enhanced the survival rate for the remaining fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   But the doctor, Charles Hux, a specialist in high-risk
pregnancies, said their decision not to reduce the number of
embryos had no bearing on the miscarriage. ``The same thing could
have happened to a woman carrying one baby,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zapata-Smalls remains at Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune,
where she had been hospitalized since last month as a precaution
against complications. If all had gone well, doctors would have
delivered the babies by Caesarean section between her 27th and 29th
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few women have successfully carried septuplets, among
them Bobbi McCaughey of Carlisle, Iowa, who had the world's first
surviving set in 1997. Hux said Zapata-Smalls' miscarriage was not
unexpected. ``This is what normally happens with multiple
pregnancies,'' he said. ``The human body is not designed to carry
so many fetuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Zapata-Smalls, who had had difficulty becoming pregnant, had
taken the fertility drug Pergonal. From the beginning, Hux had
warned the couple that carrying all seven babies to term would be a
threat to the mother and the children. Even the babies that
survived, he said, would have faced severe birth defects or other
medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from his home Tuesday afternoon, Smalls, 37, said he
was saddened by the loss but more worried about his wife, who is
blaming herself for the miscarriage. ``She's depressed,'' he said.
``She feels like she murdered her kids. She feels like she let the
world down.''
</P>
<P>
   An ordained evangelical minister who earns his living as a
bodyguard for pop music performers, Smalls stressed that the doctor
told him the decision not to abort several of embryos had nothing
to do with the miscarriage. ``I want the world to know that,''
Smalls said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his opposition to abortion, he said the decision not to
reduce the number of fetuses was also influenced by the couple's
lingering grief over the loss two years ago of their only child,
Anisa, who died of complications from rheumatoid arthritis. She was
21 months old.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference last week announcing her pregnancy,
Zapata-Smalls said: ``I figure this is a blessing from God. He gave
me the strength to get through my daughter's death to face this.''
</P>
<P>
   Zapata-Smalls, an executive assistant at American Express, is
expected to be discharged from the hospital by Thursday. Hux said
the miscarriage should not prevent her from becoming pregnant
again. &QL;

<P>
   As more women take infertility treatments and multiple
pregnancies increase, some doctors worry that the news media are
glamorizing attempts to carry multiple fetuses to term.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Louis Keith, president of the Center for the Study of
Multiple Births in Chicago, called multiple births ``one of the
tragedies of modern medicine,'' saying that the more fetuses a
woman carries, the greater the risk to her health and that of her
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American public may have a love affair with bigger, better
and more,'' Keith said, ``but in the case of multiple pregnancies,
more is not good.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, after the couple decided against aborting several of
the fetuses, Hux sutured Zapata-Smalls' cervix to try to prevent
premature labor. Zapata-Smalls' health was good until last Friday,
he said, when she caught an upper respiratory infection.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday, she was running a 102-degree fever and experiencing
contractions. When Hux examined her the next morning, he discovered
that her womb was infected and filled with amniotic fluid. He
removed the stitches, and during the next few hours ``nature took
its course,'' he said, with all seven fetuses stillborn.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he did not know the exact source of the infection,
but that the mother's fever dropped immediately after the
miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at a news conference at the hospital Tuesday night,
Smalls said he was not sure whether his wife would try to become
pregnant again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it fair to put my wife through this danger again? Is it
fair to the kids?'' he asked. ``She's mentally depressed and
physically hurt. I can't answer that right now.''

BUSH MAY HAVE LOST ADVANTAGE OF WINNER IMAGE

<P>
   GOFFSTOWN, N.H. _ The defeat of Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
made-for-television New Hampshire presidential campaign in
Tuesday's primary may have blown one of Bush's greatest political
advantages _ the aura of a winner who can defeat the Democrats in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are arguing that Bush is the best bet will at
least have to take a second look at it,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a
University of Texas political science professor. ``It (McCain's
victory) is going to create a big stir.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire voters _ particularly independents _ turned away
from the slick advertising and friendly images of Bush's campaign
to give a commanding victory to Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will continue to hold an advantage in the Republican
primaries to come, where independents play a lesser role than they
did in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in a CNN interview, said McCain ``came at me from the left
here in New Hampshire. So it will be a clear race between a more
moderate to liberal candidate versus a more conservative candidate
in South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush could quickly recoup his status of front-runner in the
upcoming primaries of Delaware on Feb. 8 and South Carolina on Feb.
19. McCain has declared the South Carolina primary as one of his
battlegrounds, but Bush has held a 20 percentage point lead in
public opinion polls there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like my chances in Delaware,'' Bush said. ``South Carolina
is Bush country.''
</P>
<P>
   But the sharp turn of New Hampshire independents toward McCain
will raise questions about whether Bush really is the candidate who
will have the broad appeal to win the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, speaking to about 1,500 supporters at Saint Anselm
College, downplayed the voting as anything other than the results
of McCain essentially running a one-state campaign while Bush built
a national campaign organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road to the Republican nomination and the White House is a
long road. Mine will go through all 50 states, and I intend for it
to end at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush strategist Karl Rove said no Republican has won the
presidential nomination without losing somewhere along the way. He
said the fact that independents went for McCain is not a long-term
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're quirky New Hampshire liberal independents,'' Rove
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unprecedented outpouring of people drawn by the
sort of liberal themes that he (McCain) struck.''
</P>
<P>
   But exit polls by Voter News Service showed McCain held appeal
to more than just independents. McCain won independents by a margin
of 3-to-1 over Bush, but McCain also won a majority of the
conservative Republican vote.
</P>
<P>
   Four out of five New Hampshire voters said they believed
campaign-finance reform _ the centerpiece of McCain's campaign _
would help the nation. Republicans who agreed with that went for
McCain 2-to-1 over Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst news for Bush in the exit polls was voters'
feelings about candidate sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether they believe a candidate says what he
believes or what he wants the voters to hear, half said McCain says
what he believes while only one in six said Bush was sincere.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's New Hampshire campaign focused on portraying him as a
``compassionate conservative'' who would deliver a $483 billion tax
cut to America.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since launching his New Hampshire campaign last summer,
Bush has been criticized for taking the state for granted while
building his national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   By normal political standards, Bush should have ended the New
Hampshire primary as the odds-on favorite. He had spent $3.3
million to win the state to McCain's $2.1 million. But McCain had
spent 65 days campaigning in the state, according to the National
Journal, while Bush had been in New Hampshire 36 days since March
1999.
</P>
<P>
   And the race had turned toward McCain's favor in October when
Bush passed on a nationally televised debate at Dartmouth College
to attend a ceremony in which his wife, Laura, was named a
distinguished alumna at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. At
the time Bush said, ``I don't have to apologize for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush passed on the traditional anyone-come town hall meetings.
Instead his campaign chose the atmosphere of gatherings of
insurance company and state agency employees, who were unlikely to
ask hostile questions in front of their employers.
</P>
<P>
   In one risky move, Bush had his father, former President Bush,
come to the state over the weekend in a public display of support.
A poor showing in the 1992 New Hampshire Republican primary
signaled the beginning of the end of the president's re-election
campaign.

ANALYSIS: N.H., RELISHING ITS ROLE, UPSETS THE APPLE CART _ AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: ADDS new 7th graf, But Gore ..., with fresh quote;   corrects
9th graf, NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll was conducted in
January.) 
 (With NH-REPUBS, NH-DEMS and sidebars)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ It was not a great night for the dauphins of
2000, though worse for George W. Bush than for Al Gore, and the
results suggested strongly that both parties now face long, costly
struggles for their presidential nominations. As they have so often
before, the voters of New Hampshire upset the apple cart of
conventional wisdom, throwing both races into doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the governor of Texas, has far more money than the man who
trounced him here, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, and he has better
organizations in most of the states whose Republican primaries come
next. For now, he remains the favorite, but McCain's victory _ not
only the fact but also the size of it, which staggered the Bush
camp _ dealt a painful blow to Bush's principal stock in trade: the
notion that his nomination is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Bush get much traction from the argument, constantly
voiced by his supporters if not by the candidate himself, that he
is the Republicans' most likely winner in November. Voters in the
Republican primary split nearly evenly as to whether Bush or McCain
would make the stronger nominee.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won because voters in the Republican contest said that
what mattered most to them was finding a man of unshakeable
character, willing to stand up for his convictions. McCain filled
that bill for them.
</P>
<P>
   Gore won by a relatively narrow margin, and a win is of course
better than a loss. But he had hoped to blunt the challenge of
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey in the Iowa caucuses and the
primary here, and in that he failed. As a result he now faces
clusters of tests in states across the country, starting in early
March. Gore has the organizational edge, but Bradley can come close
to matching him dollar for dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides expect a bruising struggle, with more of the mutual
questioning of motives that marked the final week here, even though
Bradley expresses disdain for what he calls ``politics as usual''
(read mud-slinging). The more personal and belligerent the contest
becomes, of course, the greater the potential damage to the
eventual victor. In years past, such damage has proved a major
handicap in the big show in November.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore told his followers late Tuesday night, ``I will never
make a negative personal attack.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine, a Democrat, built a
seemingly unstoppable campaign on the same basis as Bush did this
year, amassing handfuls of endorsements from party bigwigs. But he
did poorly in New Hampshire and never managed to regain his
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll asked
Republicans who expressed a preference for Bush whether they would
consider switching to McCain if he began to win primaries. More
than 40 percent said they would.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush promised Tuesday night in his concession statement to
campaign in all 50 states, dismissing New Hampshire as a mere
``bump in the road.'' He said he would be a better candidate for
having faced competition here, and described South Carolina, where
Republicans vote on Feb. 19, as Bush country.
</P>
<P>
   If the rest of the nation behaves like New Hampshire, this could
prove to be an outsiders' year. But this state's electorate is
quirky, with an unquenchable thirst for mavericks and rockers of
boats. For example, former Sen. Paul Tsongas, who won here in 1992,
had trouble repeating his victory elsewhere. In the past it has
often come to idiosyncratic conclusions, at least partly because it
gets a much closer look at the candidates than any of the other
states do.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire has never been particularly kind to candidates
with names made famous by their relatives. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., did poorly here. So did former Gov. Jerry Brown of
California and, much further back, Sen. Robert A. Taft of Ohio.
Eugene J. McCarthy, the anti-war insurgent, proved a much better
fit in the momentous 1968 Democratic primary, which helped drive
President Lyndon B. Johnson from office.
</P>
<P>
   Another atypical aspect of New Hampshire is its election law.
This state permits voters who are registered in neither party to
vote in either the Republican or the Democratic primary, and exit
polls indicated that these independents had been crucial in
McCain's astonishing sweep.
</P>
<P>
   More than four voters in 10 in Tuesday's Republican balloting,
not much less than half, said that they were independents. McCain
beat Bush by better than 3-1 among those voters, providing most of
his margin of victory. Among registered Republicans, McCain
prevailed more narrowly, the exit polling showed.
</P>
<P>
   That pattern will not be repeated in most of their subsequent
contests, simply because most states exclude independents from
primary elections. But if McCain could somehow win the nomination _
a gargantuan ``if,'' to be sure _ his strength among independents
would be a significant advantage in the general election,
especially against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Exuberant, McCain said the results here marked ``the beginning
of the end for the truth-twisting politics of Bill Clinton and Al
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also benefited from the votes of independents, but fewer
of them voted in the Democratic than in the Republican race. Nearly
two in 10 of the Republican voters said they had flirted with
voting for Bradley before deciding, many at the last minute, to
back McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Still, independents voting in the Democratic contest, some of
them people who said they were exasperated with Clinton, gave
Bradley an indispensable lift. Without them, Gore, with strong
backing from union members, hard-core Democrats and women, would
have swamped him.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Andrew Smith, the director of the University of New
Hampshire Survey Center, said that McCain's Vietnam War record and
his backing of campaign-finance reform had convinced New Hampshire
voters that he was ``a stand-up guy.'' Campaign finance itself was
not a big issue, he said, but McCain's willingness to buck his
party redounded to his credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last week,'' Smith said, ``the Republican side looked
like the closer race, and more independents went that way'' _ even
though the Democratic contest eventually proved to be tighter, in
part because of the independents' decision.
</P>
<P>
   A number of voters said that they had voted tactically.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Ciarla, a 26-year-old teacher from Derry, explained: ``I'll
be voting for Al Gore in the general election, but I voted for the
next best guy today, John McCain, so George Bush doesn't show
strongly in New Hampshire. A lot of people think Bush is a shoo-in.
If it turns out to be Gore and McCain when I vote for president in
the fall, I'll be a happy man.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was by no means the first time that independents pouring into
the Republican race have played a major role in the New Hampshire
primary, the first in the nation. In 1996, they divided their votes
between Lamar Alexander and Pat Buchanan, which effectively denied
Bob Dole a victory. Similarly, in 1992, independents divided their
votes between President George Bush and Buchanan, shocking the
party, emboldening Buchanan and contributing to Bush's defeat that
November by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's victory was not only broad but deep. He was preferred,
according to the exit polls, by men and women, young and old, rich
and poor, those with advanced educations and those without, those
who had served in the nation's armed forces and those who had not.
</P>
<P>
   But the story was different in the Democratic balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Gore held the line among traditional Democratic groups, notably
trade union members, and ran strongly among women. More men voted
for Bradley, as did those with graduate degrees, presumably
including a significant share of the workers in the state's
expanding high-tech industries. Those with college degrees and
those with no degrees at all tended to opt for the vice president.

JURY PICKED IN TRIAL OF OFFICERS ACCUSED OF MURDERING DIALLO

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The four white police officers accused of
murdering Amadou Diallo, who had contended that they could not get
a fair trial in the Bronx, learned Tuesday who would decide their
fate: four blacks and eight whites chosen after a barrage of
objections that each side was trying to exclude jurors based on
race.
</P>
<P>
   In a case fraught from the beginning with racial tension, the
defense lawyers abandoned their attempt to shield potential jurors
from discussions of racial bias Tuesday, openly and repeatedly
questioning blacks in the jury pool about their attitudes on race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to talk about race,'' said Stephen C. Worth, a
lawyer for one officer. ``We're all worried about it on the defense
side. It's something that hangs in the air in this courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could cut the racial tension in this courtroom with a
knife,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing one black woman in the jury pool, Worth said: ``We
have four white officers from a different background, from a
different place. Do you think you can be fair?'' She said she
thought that she could, and was eventually selected.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was moved to Albany County, which is largely white,
after defense lawyers requested a change of venue, asserting
prejudicial pretrial publicity, and because the Bronx is ``a place
in which large numbers of people harbor an inherent distrust or
even hatred of the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Opening arguments are to begin on Wednesday. After the session
ended Tuesday, defense lawyers expressed no dissatisfaction with
the jury's racial composition. ``We expected a racially diverse
jury,'' Worth said. ``We have a racially diverse jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo supporters were jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very good,'' said Saikou Amad Diallo, the victim's
father. ``It's starting very good and fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's mother, Kadiatou, said that the jury was ``very
inclusive'' and that she was pleased.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has led protests for the last year
about the shooting of Diallo by the police, said, ``You can take
the trial out of the Bronx, but you can't take the Bronx out of the
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, defense lawyers had tried, out of earshot of the
jury, to use a peremptory challenge to exclude a black woman who
had lived in the Bronx for 10 years, but Justice Joseph C. Teresi
refused to remove her and another black woman challenged by the
defense. But he allowed them to remove a third black woman. He also
rejected at least one of the defense's peremptory challenges
Tuesday, but it was not clear whether it was of one of the two
black women who were added.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the 12 jurors and four alternates seated Tuesday have
Bronx ties. A black woman who lived in the Bronx will be the
forewoman, selected because she was sitting in the first position
in the jury box. Another black woman said she visited the Bronx
regularly and was last there on New Year's Day. A white man said
his parents grew up in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Worth said the defense had not wanted jurors with connections to
the Bronx because they might share their perceptions of the borough
with other jurors. ``They start becoming unsworn witnesses in the
jury room,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there are four black women, two white women and six
white men. All four alternates are white men. The first alternate
described himself as a gay activist who had been a hate crime
victim and had participated in demonstrations in Albany, New York
City and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, prosecutors from the Bronx district attorney's
office sought to exclude at least seven white men from the jury and
were allowed to do so. Defense lawyers had asserted that the
prosecutors were improperly using race as a basis to exclude the
men, but the prosecutors responded that they would inevitably
remove a large number of white men as jurors because they made up
such a large proportion of the pool.
</P>
<P>
   The officers on trial _ Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward
McMellon and Richard Murphy _ fired 41 shots at Diallo, who was
unarmed, hitting him 19 times as he stood in the vestibule of his
Bronx apartment building. The officers have said through their
lawyers that they thought Diallo had a gun.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The first people to testify for the prosecution will be a
witness from the crime scene, an emergency medical technician and
the first lieutenant to arrive on the scene after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   It was disclosed Monday that prosecutors had obtained a
videotape of Diallo in the hours before his death and wanted to
play it for the jury. The defense objected strongly to allowing the
jury to see it, calling it ``highly prejudicial.''
</P>
<P>
   The tape could have the effect of humanizing Diallo for a jury
that would otherwise see him only in photographs, if at all. Taken
by a convenience store security camera, it shows Diallo on the
morning of the last day of his life, smiling, joking and wearing
the same clothes that he would be killed in. He was a frequent
patron of the convenience store, which was near the spot on 14th
Street in Manhattan where he worked as a street peddler.
</P>
<P>
   Worth said there was ``no probative value'' to the tape, but
Eric Warner, the chief prosecutor, said Diallo's physical
appearance and clothing could be relevant. Teresi said he would
view the tape and decide later.
</P>
<P>
   The scene outside the courthouse at the end of the day seemed
almost like a trial of its own, complete with rebuttal. As the
defense lawyers stood watching, Sharpton, flanked by a group of
black and Hispanic legislators, faced a bank of television cameras
and accused the defense of playing racial politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a diverse jury not because of them but in spite of
them,'' Sharpton said, referring to the defense's attempt to strike
the black jurors from the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was the turn of Worth; John D. Patten, the lawyer for
Officer Carroll, and Patrick Lynch, the president of the
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. Worth accused Sharpton of being
``disingenuous'' for saying race was not a factor in the case, and
called the protests he had led a ``circus.''
</P>
<P>
   An outraged Sharpton then reclaimed the microphones, criticized
the defense team as lacking racial diversity itself, called the use
of the word circus offensive, and said, ``I hope they don't try to
divide this state and have their clients escape through a racial
divide.''

<P>
   The Election Day poll was based on questionnaires completed
Tuesday by voters as they left voting stations across New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium
formed by ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Fox News, NBC News and The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The poll included voters in 55 precincts throughout New
Hampshire, with 1,954 voting in the Republican primary and 1,686
voting in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results from such polls
should differ by only 3 percentage points in either direction from
what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all voters
who turned out in the state Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Results based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential
sampling error. In addition to sampling error, the practical
difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion on Election
Day, like the reluctance of some voters to take the time to fill
out questionnaires, may introduce other sources of error into the
poll.

INDEPENDENTS GIVE MCCAIN STUNNING VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Tops with McCain, Bush comments)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Senator John McCain, a Vietnam war herowho
bet his presidential campaign on a strong New Hampshire showing,
rode a wave of support from independents Tuesday to easily defeat
the better-financed and much-endorsed Texas Governor George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wonderful New Hampshire campaign has come to an end, but a
great national crusade has just begun,'' McCain, 63, told a joyous
throng of supporters at Nashua's Crowne Plaza Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, after telephoning his congratulations to McCain,
acknowledged his defeat at a rally last night at Saint Anselm
College in Goffstown.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire has long been known as a bump in the road for
front-runners. And this year will be no exception.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, who has frequently noted that McCain's campaign
focused extensively on New Hampshire, emphasized that the road to
the White House is a long one. ``Mine will go through all 50 states
and I intend it to end at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,'' the Texas
governor said.
</P>
<P>
   With McCain skipping next week's primary in Delaware, the next
major test will come in South Carolina, which holds its Republican
primary Feb. 19. Bush is far ahead in the polls there and has
raised far more money than McCain, but the Arizona senator is
hoping his strong Granite State performance will kick off a burst
of publicity and contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but be amazed by the size of this,'' McCain
said of the vote in the presidential suite at the hotel shortly
after television networks declared him the winner. ``It's across
the board. It came from all sectors _ conservatives, moderates,
liberals, women. It's a win for the message. The people in
Washington are going to wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy McCain's eyes filled with tears as she heard the news, and
two of her sons, Jimmy and Jack, jumped up and down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really happened,'' Cindy McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The other three GOP candidates _ Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes, and
Gary Bauer _ trailed far behind.
</P>
<P>
   In the storied history of the first-in-the-nation primary,
McCain's victory _ and the size of it _ may be one of the most
improbable.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was given little chance of winning the primary when he
entered the contest last year. As recently as last August, Bush led
McCain by 44 percent to 12 percent in a Boston Globe/WBZ-TV poll.
Indeed, McCain, who frequently mixed with his political patter with
self-deprecating humor, never tired of saying that he was once at 3
percent in polls that had a 5 percent margin of error, meaning that
his standing could be ``below zero.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain, who took to calling everyone here ``my dear
friends,'' made up the difference by conducting 114 town meetings,
touting his war record in a best-selling biography, and making
himself endlessly accessible to the public and press. He became a
fixture in the state, partly due to a strategic decision to skip
the caucuses in Iowa, where Bush spent many precious days.
</P>
<P>
   Despite McCain's victory, many analysts believe he still faces
an uphill battle against Bush. The Texas governor is the candidate
backed by most establishment figures, which worked against Bush
here but could help him in many other states. Bush has raised
nearly $70 million, compared to McCain's $13.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won overwhelmingly among independents who voted in the
GOP primary and, by a more narrow margin, he beat Bush among
Republicans, according to exit polls. McCain not only made headway
due to his maverick style and his war biography, but also because
he campaigned on several issues that appealed to independent-minded
voters. He called for an overhaul of the campaign finance system, a
massive effort to shore up Social Security and the elimination of
the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, bet his campaign on a huge tax cut program and
only began to talk significantly about Social Security and the
national debt in recent days, super-imposing a graphic about the
issues over his regular ads.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the defeat revived bitter memories of the way his
father, former President Bush, was badly bruised here in the 1992
primary, when Patrick J. Buchanan had a strong second-place
showing. Bush brought his father to New Hampshire for some
last-minute campaigning, but the imagery may have backfired.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's victory here is by no means is a sure path to the
nomination. New Hampshire voters are famous for their contrary
nature and independence, giving primary victories to Gary Hart in
1984 and Buchanan in 1996. In both those respective cases, the
better-established candidates, Walter Mondale and Bob Dole, went on
to win the nomination _ and lose the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's problems in New Hampshire became evident late last year,
when he refused to participate in a long-scheduled debate at
Dartmouth College. Bush's non-appearance, along with his relatively
light schedule in the state, did not sit well with many voters who
want candidates to adhere to New Hampshire's tradition of
accessibility and ``retail'' politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush not showing up at the first debate was definitely a
factor,'' said US Representative Charles Bass, a New Hampshire
Republican who backs Bush but warned him months ago about the
state's unpredictability. ``It gave McCain a free platform. I think
if Bush had to do it again, he would have gone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bass, like many Bush backers, doubted whether McCain's
success here will be equaled elsewhere. ``McCain ran a designer
campaign for New Hampshire...tooled to appeal to independents,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bass said the election marks a dramatic shift for New Hampshire,
which he attributes to election laws that allowed independents to
more easily vote in the primaries than before. The current law
allows independents to register at the polls as a Democrat or
Republican, and then switch back to independent on the way out.
Previously, Bass said, the process was more time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   Bush learned Tuesday afternoon that exit polling by the media
was signaling his defeat. He spent the afternoon at his hotel in
Merrimack with his wife and their twin teenage daughters. He had
started the day with a polling-stop blitz _ canvassing five polling
sites and a restaurant in three hours, starting at 6:30 a.m. _ but
gave up when it was clear the media cluster was preventing his
talking to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Before the polls closed at 8 p.m., Bush's Southeast regional
chairman, J. Warren Tompkins, had a piece of advice for his
candidate: ``Erase New Hampshire out of your memory and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Bush had been preparing for a defeat in New
Hampshire, despite his insistence, right up until Tuesday morning,
that he expected to win. But he also sounded like he was making
excuses for defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (McCain) made a decision to skip the first caucuses, and I
think Republicans need somebody who can run across the nation,''
Bush said at a campaign stop at the McKelvie School in Bedford.
``Its a long process. He has run a good campaign here, but so have
I. And I'm going to go to the next state, the next state, and the
next state, until I win our party's nomination. And then I'm going
to unite our party, and lead us to victory.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain alternated between confidence and caution Tuesday
morning. He had heard the news about Dixville Notch and Hart's
Landing, the two tiny towns that begin voting at 12:01 a.m.: the
combined vote in those towns broke down almost evenly, but not
quite. Bush garnered 17 votes, and McCain 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``The landslide has begun,'' McCain joked early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Little did he know, it had.
</P>
<P>
   For Forbes, the only good news out of the primary was that
McCain was victorious. Forbes had boldly predicted that he would
finish in the top two and that Bush would come in third. Forbes had
hoped to receive a boost in the polls after his strong second-place
Iowa finish. But Forbes' focus on the flat tax, his antiabortion
emphasis and his self-described ``charismatically challenged''
manner did not win over nearly enough voters. But Forbes said he
will not drop out of the race regardless of how he finishes in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The other two candidates, Keyes and Bauer, based their campaigns
on their strong antiabortion views, but had little hope of a strong
showing in this state where the majority of voters tell pollsters
that they favor abortion rights.

INDEPENDENTS GIVE MCCAIN STUNNING VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Tops with McCain, Bush comments)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Senator John McCain, a Vietnam war herowho
bet his presidential campaign on a strong New Hampshire showing,
rode a wave of support from independents Tuesday to easily defeat
the better-financed and much-endorsed Texas Governor George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wonderful New Hampshire campaign has come to an end, but a
great national crusade has just begun,'' McCain, 63, told a joyous
throng of supporters at Nashua's Crowne Plaza Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, after telephoning his congratulations to McCain,
acknowledged his defeat at a rally last night at Saint Anselm
College in Goffstown.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire has long been known as a bump in the road for
front-runners. And this year will be no exception.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, who has frequently noted that McCain's campaign
focused extensively on New Hampshire, emphasized that the road to
the White House is a long one. ``Mine will go through all 50 states
and I intend it to end at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,'' the Texas
governor said.
</P>
<P>
   With McCain skipping next week's primary in Delaware, the next
major test will come in South Carolina, which holds its Republican
primary Feb. 19. Bush is far ahead in the polls there and has
raised far more money than McCain, but the Arizona senator is
hoping his strong Granite State performance will kick off a burst
of publicity and contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but be amazed by the size of this,'' McCain
said of the vote in the presidential suite at the hotel shortly
after television networks declared him the winner. ``It's across
the board. It came from all sectors _ conservatives, moderates,
liberals, women. It's a win for the message. The people in
Washington are going to wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy McCain's eyes filled with tears as she heard the news, and
two of her sons, Jimmy and Jack, jumped up and down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really happened,'' Cindy McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The other three GOP candidates _ Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes, and
Gary Bauer _ trailed far behind.
</P>
<P>
   In the storied history of the first-in-the-nation primary,
McCain's victory _ and the size of it _ may be one of the most
improbable.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was given little chance of winning the primary when he
entered the contest last year. As recently as last August, Bush led
McCain by 44 percent to 12 percent in a Boston Globe/WBZ-TV poll.
Indeed, McCain, who frequently mixed with his political patter with
self-deprecating humor, never tired of saying that he was once at 3
percent in polls that had a 5 percent margin of error, meaning that
his standing could be ``below zero.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain, who took to calling everyone here ``my dear
friends,'' made up the difference by conducting 114 town meetings,
touting his war record in a best-selling biography, and making
himself endlessly accessible to the public and press. He became a
fixture in the state, partly due to a strategic decision to skip
the caucuses in Iowa, where Bush spent many precious days.
</P>
<P>
   Despite McCain's victory, many analysts believe he still faces
an uphill battle against Bush. The Texas governor is the candidate
backed by most establishment figures, which worked against Bush
here but could help him in many other states. Bush has raised
nearly $70 million, compared to McCain's $13.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won overwhelmingly among independents who voted in the
GOP primary and, by a more narrow margin, he beat Bush among
Republicans, according to exit polls. McCain not only made headway
due to his maverick style and his war biography, but also because
he campaigned on several issues that appealed to independent-minded
voters. He called for an overhaul of the campaign finance system, a
massive effort to shore up Social Security and the elimination of
the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, bet his campaign on a huge tax cut program and
only began to talk significantly about Social Security and the
national debt in recent days, super-imposing a graphic about the
issues over his regular ads.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the defeat revived bitter memories of the way his
father, former President Bush, was badly bruised here in the 1992
primary, when Patrick J. Buchanan had a strong second-place
showing. Bush brought his father to New Hampshire for some
last-minute campaigning, but the imagery may have backfired.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's victory here is by no means is a sure path to the
nomination. New Hampshire voters are famous for their contrary
nature and independence, giving primary victories to Gary Hart in
1984 and Buchanan in 1996. In both those respective cases, the
better-established candidates, Walter Mondale and Bob Dole, went on
to win the nomination _ and lose the general election.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore held off a strong
challenge by former Sen. Bill Bradley in the New Hampshire primary
Tuesday, but both candidates vowed a long, tough fight for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, despite a solid victory in the Iowa caucuses eight days
ago, now faces the critical month of March, when more than half the
party's convention delegates will be elected on the first two
Tuesdays, with a dead serious fight ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Tuesday night, Bradley congratulated Gore without
using the words ``victory'' or ``defeat,'' saying, ``We have made a
remarkable turnaround, but there is still a tough fight ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in an exuberant victory speech after he was introduced to
cheering supporters in Manchester by his wife, Tipper, said, ``We
have just begun to fight.'' He called Bradley ``a tough competitor
who made us fight for every vote.'' He told supporters that he had
fought back after trailing Bradley here for 14 weeks, and promised
to lead them to ``victory in November.''
</P>
<P>
   With 81 percent of New Hampshire's precincts reporting, Gore had
52 percent of the vote to 47 percent for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   One key reason why the fight will be rough is that, according to
a poll of Tuesday's voters, Bradley got a substantial majority from
those who decided in the last few days, when he was most combative.
Those poll results may push him toward confrontations in the weeks
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   After this brief moment of voter participation, the Democratic
campaign will shift back to an inside game, with no caucuses or
primaries for the rest of the month. The fields of competition, as
they were all last year, will once again be fund raising,
organization and message, and each candidate will be able to spend
about $20 million more.
</P>
<P>
   Before the polls closed Tuesday, an upbeat Bradley challenged
Gore to debate him once a week between now and the March primaries.
Previously he had spurned Gore's suggestion of twice-weekly
debates, coupled with a mutual agreement not to use 30-second
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley sent a letter to Gore that said nothing about
commercials but concluded, ``I am certain that these debates will
provide a useful road map to the voters as to where the Democratic
Party will take the country in this new century.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter Eskew, Gore's senior strategist, complained that Bradley
was not proposing ``getting rid of ads,'' adding: ``He has gone
halfway. Maybe he'll go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Eskew said, ``We'll enter discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire contest, for 22 of the 4,339 delegates to the
Democratic National Convention, was never likely to be decisive,
although Gore partisans had hoped that a second straight defeat
would discourage Bradley and his backers. And they had begun to
orchestrate appeals by other Democrats for Bradley to halt negative
and personal campaigning in the interest of party unity.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, who retired from the Senate after three terms in
which he represented New Jersey, had insisted all along that he
would stay through what he called the ``national primary'' next
month, when 1,625 delegates will be chosen on March 7 and another
673 on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   One Bradley supporter, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., predicted early
Tuesday that whatever the New Hampshire result, Bradley would not
withdraw. ``I hope he stays in all the way to the convention,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another former colleague, retired Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., who
often worked across party lines with Bradley, said dryly, ``The
party unity argument would not be a strong one with him.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the results came in the party establishment started in
on Bradley. David J. Worley, the Democratic chairman in Georgia,
said: ``I think he should drop out. I hope he won't be encouraged
by this mediocre showing to continue these negative attacks from
last week. That's not good for him and it's not good for the
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Bradley's claim of a ``turnaround,'' Worley said,
``Any more turnarounds like this and he'll be out of the race for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's primary is March 7, and the entire party apparatus
supports Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Calls like Worley's overlook the fact that a continuing element
of Bradley's campaign has been that he is the Democratic candidate
independent of the Democratic president. About a fifth of the
party's voters surveyed by a consortium of five television networks
and The Associated Press as they left polling places Tuesday said
that Gore's ties to President Clinton were very important to them.
Bradley did quite well among those voters. He also did well with
those who had an unfavorable view of Clinton personally.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did best among groups that Democrats depend on in general
elections, including union members and women. (Gore is popular with
many black voters, but this state has a negligible black
population.)
</P>
<P>
   But the other ingredient of general election victory, support
from independents, favored Bradley. Independents cast about
one-third of the Democratic ballots Tuesday, and Bradley got almost
three-fifths of them. He also did best among voters with graduate
degrees and those 18 to 25 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a third of the Democrats said they wanted a candidate who
would stand up for principle. Bradley got two-thirds of their
votes.
</P>
<P>
   But a slightly smaller group, about one-fifth, said they wanted
a candidate with experience. Almost all of them voted for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate profited from the issue he had emphasized. Those
voters most concerned about the nation's schools preferred Gore;
those troubled about health care went for Bradley.

RUSH SUSPENDED 1{ SEASONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA sophomore forward JaRon Rush was suspended
for 1{ seasons Tuesday by the NCAA for two rules violations _
meaning he won't return until midway through next season unless the
penalty is reduced on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   According to UCLA, Rush took $6,125 from former AAU coach Myron
Piggie, resulting in a 29-game (one-season) suspension. He also
accepted $200 from Los Angeles sports agent Jerome Stanley,
resulting in a 15-game suspension. (Stanley has denied any
wrongdoing.)
</P>
<P>
   Rush already has missed 15 games this season, which satisfies
the Stanley penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The Piggie penalty starts Thursday against Stanford. It
encompasses the last 12 games this season and the first 17 next
season. Any NCAA tournament games UCLA participates in this year
would count as part of Rush's suspension for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised by the severity,'' UCLA athletic director Peter
Dalis said. ``I think the NCAA set the standard very high because
they're concerned about other cases that might come out of the AAU
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the final step: UCLA will appeal the 29-game Piggie
penalty to the NCAA Subcommittee on Student-Athlete Reinstatement,
a process that could take a week or two. School officials are
hoping the suspension will be reduced from 29 games to 12, which
would enable Rush to play all of next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're challenging the facts that are the basis for the
penalty,'' Dalis said. ``We interpret the information differently
from the NCAA.... (But) I'd be surprised if I saw him this
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush is in Kansas City with his family and legal counsel and
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next 10 or 12 games, he'll be OK,'' said Rush's
grandmother, Jeanette Jacobs. ``The thing I'm worried about is the
17 games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have reason to be optimistic about the appeal. Rush's
brother, Kareem, a Missouri freshman who accepted $1,800 from
Piggie, had a half-season suspension reduced to one-third on
appeal. Oklahoma State freshman Andre Williams had a one-year
suspension reduced to five games on appeal in a similar case.
</P>
<P>
   JaRon Rush's problems began in November, when he testified
before a Kansas City grand jury, which was investigating Piggie for
tax evasion and fraud. During his testimony, Rush, who didn't have
legal counsel present, tipped off the FBI that he might have
violated NCAA rules by accepting money from Piggie.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI informed UCLA, which suspended Rush on Dec. 10 and began
an internal investigation. On Jan. 13, when UCLA forwarded its
findings to the NCAA, school officials thought a one-season
suspension was the most-likely outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal focuses on Rush's relationships with Piggie and
Kansas booster Tom Grant, and the source of the $6,125. Grant paid
for Rush's education at Pembroke Hill School and served as his
benefactor for several years. The NCAA found nothing wrong with
their relationship as long as Rush did not attend Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Grant also hired Piggie to coach an AAU team that included Rush
and former prep stars Korleone Young and Corey Maggette, plus
current Bruins guard Earl Watson, a Kansas City, Kan., native.
</P>
<P>
   Why was Rush allowed to accept money from Grant but not from
Grant's employee, Piggie? According to UCLA officials, Rush did not
know the origin of Piggie's money _ whether it came from Grant,
Nike, which sponsored the team, or a third source.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that a 17-year-old can determine what's OK on
one hand and not OK on the other, that's what is so difficult for
us to deal with,'' Dalis said.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, a Kansas City, Kan., native, is not under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no reason to believe (he) will be,'' Dalis said. ``We
asked, and the FBI said there was nothing to be concerned about
from their perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the suspension, Rush has until the conclusion of
his college career to donate $6,325 to the charity of UCLA's
choice.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA spokesperson Jane Jankowski could not be reached for
comment. Nor could Kansas City attorney Rich Hilliard, a former
NCAA investigator who assisted UCLA.

UNION CHALLENGES ROCKER'S SUSPENSION
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The players association, as expected, filed a grievance Tuesday
challenging Commissioner Bud Selig's suspension of John Rocker,
then explained why the move did not create a conflict among union
members, many of whom have been critical of the remarks by Rocker
that prompted the disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Selig suspended Rocker for all 45 days of spring
training and for the first 28 days of the season, and fined the
Atlanta Braves' closer $20,000. The players association, in its
grievance, said the discipline was ``without just cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Union representatives and labor representatives of the
commissioner's office are scheduled to meet Thursday, when they
will establish ground rules for the grievance hearing. Shyam Das,
baseball's arbitrator, is expected to hear the case either next
week or the week after.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said Tuesday
that no player had criticized the union for challenging the
suspension, nor did he anticipate any complaints from players.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are undoubtedly a number of players, most players, I
think, who disapprove of what Rocker said,'' Orza said in a
telephone interview. ``No one at this hearing is going to say what
he said is good. But if you talk to players one on one, they have
an interest in ensuring that in a sport where they are told to talk
to the press, a penalty of this magnitude cannot be visited upon
them if they speak. All players have a stake in this.''
</P>
<P>
   The association, Orza said, has heard from many players since
Rocker was quoted in a magazine article in December disparaging
foreigners and gays, among others. ``Most of them are very
concerned about what he said,'' Orza said, ``but none I have spoken
to feel a penalty of this nature doesn't require a response from
the union.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting for Rocker, he said, does not represent a conflict for
the union. ``There were a lot of players who didn't want us to
represent Steve Howe, but it wasn't Steve Howe; it was the
principle that was at stake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Orza was referring to a 1992 case involving Howe, then a Yankees
relief pitcher, who had been suspended for life by Commissioner Fay
Vincent after another encounter with drugs. The union filed a
grievance and won. The Rocker and Howe cases, from the union's
standpoint, are perhaps similar to the American Civil Liberties
Union representing a neo-Nazi group in its attempt to march in
Skokie, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid grievances, commissioners or league presidents have
often discussed with the union possible disciplinary action before
determining it. ``We had discussions about reaching a resolution on
this matter,'' Orza said, ``but from our end it never approached
the magnitude of this penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the results of challenges to previous suspensions, the
union would seem to have at least a 50-50 chance of winning this
one, most likely by having the suspension reduced. Although the
union would like to have the suspension overturned altogether, it
would likely consider it a victory if the arbitrator were to reduce
the suspension.
</P>
<P>
   During Bowie Kuhn's tenure as commissioner, arbitrators
overturned or reduced many of his suspensions of players for drug
offenses, most notably his 1980 suspension of Ferguson Jenkins.
Jenkins was arrested in Canada and accused of having marijuana in
his suitcase. In a case that was not drug related, Kuhn disciplined
Alex Johnson in 1971 by placing him on the restricted list. The
union, contending that Johnson was emotionally disabled and should
have been placed on the disabled list, like a physically injured
player, filed a grievance and won.
</P>
<P>
   In his action against Rocker, Selig said he could not
participate in spring training with the Braves, but could begin
extended spring training and participate with minor league teams in
the Braves' system beginning April 3, when the major league season
opens. Selig said Rocker could not play with the Braves until May
1.

BRADLEY VOWS TO STAY IN FIGHT AFTER NARROW LOSS TO GORE 

</HEADLINE>

By CRAGG HINES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore, enhancing his status as
the clear front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination,
defeated former Sen. Bill Bradley in New Hampshire's season-opening
primary Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley vowed to fight on, setting the stage for a personal,
possibly vengeful battle in the five weeks before the next big
Democratic contests in a dozen states, including California and New
York. But without a victory in New Hampshire, a state fabled for
its openness to insurgent, underdog candidates, the short term
could be a tough slog for the former professional basketball star
and the longer term could be even bleaker.
</P>
<P>
   With most precincts reporting, Gore led Bradley, 52 percent to
47 percent. Gore scored best with traditional Democrats, who will
figure more prominently in coming contests. In New Hampshire, sunny
skies pulled out a significant number of independent voters who
supported Bradley. Polls of Democratic primary participants as they
left balloting stations indicated that more than one-third were
actually independents who could make an Election Day change in
registration. Bradley won 56 percent of those voters, Gore 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, 51, claimed victory less than two hours after the final
polls closed, but alluded to exit polls earlier in the day that
suggested a closer race, which had kept the television networks
from immediately calling the race. The vice president said some
people thought the evening might end like Sunday's Super Bowl in
which the Tennessee Titans came up a yard short in a losing effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Tennessean is in the end zone, and it feels great,'' Gore
told supporters at a victory party in Manchester. ``And you ain't
seen nothing yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, 56, had already delivered a non-concession speech,
calling his showing ``a remarkable turn-around.'' Bradley had led
Gore in state polls as recently as early January. ``There is still
a tough fight ahead,'' Bradley admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts were unimpressed with Bradley's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the handwriting is on the wall,'' said George C.
Edwards III, director of presidential studies at Texas A&AMP;M
University. ``I don't see Bradley winning, no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to see Bradley lighting a spark,'' said Fred I.
Greenstein, a Princeton University political scientist. ``A lot of
people have tried that,'' but even with victories in New Hampshire
``didn't make it to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley congratulated Gore on ``a strong campaign,'' but added,
``We're smarter and better prepared, and we're ready and eager to
continue to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore heads into a virtually contest-free five weeks with a 2-0
record, here and in Iowa. He also has the almost solid backing of a
Democratic establishment that will be increasingly anxious for a
quick end to the contest.
</P>
<P>
   As important to the party pros, they want an end to the personal
vituperation that marked the final week of campaigning in New
Hampshire. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Beginning with their debate last Wednesday, Bradley pointedly
challenged the vice president's integrity and truthfulness,
especially on the issue of Gore's support for abortion rights while
in the House and Senate in the 1980s and his role in the 1996
Democratic fund-raising scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The exit poll conducted for news media showed that late-deciding
participants in the Democratic primary swung to Bradley, indicating
that the sharper jabs at Gore may have paid off. Those who did not
settle on a candidate until Election Day favored Bradley 57-41
percent, according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a couple of non-binding ``beauty
contests,'' including one in Washington state Feb. 29, Gore and
Bradley will not face the voters until the mass of primaries March
7. A string of contests that day across the country _ including
California and New York _ will test the organizational skills of
candidates in both parties in a way that will not be repeated until
the general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates immediately began to criss-cross the nation in
what is likely to be a harried month.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after claiming victory, Gore flew to New York. During
the next two days, Gore will campaign in Ohio, California and
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley flew Tuesday night to Hartford, Conn., where he will
campaign Wednesday with former Gov. Lowell Weicker, a
Republican-turned-independent who accentuates Bradley's appeal to
the politically disaffected. During the next week Bradley will
campaign in New York, California, Maryland, Florida, Ohio and
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's victory will also make it difficult for Bradley to top up
his campaign treasury, although the financial race is far closer
than the vice president, as the party's institutional favorite,
would like.
</P>
<P>
   Through the end of 1999, Gore had raised $28 million to
Bradley's $27.1 million. And in the final quarter of last year,
Bradley, drawing on nontraditional sources of political funding,
out-raised Gore $8.4 million to $3.9 million. Bradley also had more
money in the bank on Dec. 31, $8.3 million to Gore's $5.7 million.
Both spent heavily in New Hampshire, especially on television
advertising, which includes costly outlays on Boston stations that
reach into the heavily populated southern tier of the Granite
State.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's establishment credentials were on full display in New
Hampshire, where he had the backing of the state's first women
governor, Jeanne Shanheen. Her husband, Bill, was Gore's campaign
manager here. Confident that such support would make him an easy
winner, Gore initially refused even to refer to Bradley by name.
</P>
<P>
   By last fall, Bradley, with a low-key appeal that exuded what
pundits called ``authenticity,'' had pulled ahead of Gore. Bradley
seemed especially adept at winning over Democratic-leaning
independents in town hall meetings that focused as much on a broad
vision for the nation as on nitty-gritty details of federal policy.

EXPECT NO REVOLUTION WITH REILLY MOVING IN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The new offensive coordinator of the Cowboys,
let it be noted, does not arrive at Valley Ranch with revolution on
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   No, that was the last guy's problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made the decision to get back to the style that's best
for us and that's won championships for us in the past,'' head
coach Dave Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   And thus, Jack Reilly was officially introduced yesterday to
head the club's foremost restoration project _ This Old Offense.
Forget what happened in 1998 when alleged offensive whiz Chan
Gailey was brought in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I made a mistake two years ago,'' owner Jerry Jones
admitted, candidly. (Insert gasps here).
</P>
<P>
   Gailey arrived under a mandate from Jones to stir things up
offensively. But Gailey soon made the decision that receiver
Michael Irvin couldn't help him. Further telltale assessments
followed.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' mistake, he explained, was in thinking that the old
system had grown terminally stale in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought that if you came into something completely
new, it'd be fresh,'' the owner confessed.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't. The Cowboys finished 16th in the NFL in
yards-per-game this past season, and Gailey's firing became a very
public rebuke of the new system.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly will be different. His roots are in the time-honored Don
Coryell offense _ Air Coryell. He has been an NFL assistant for 10
years, including time spent with Al Davis' mad-bomber Raiders, a
few months as quarterback coach here in 1997, and a season in San
Diego when he actually coached quarterback Stan Humphries to a
division title.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, though, as Campo reminded the media yesterday,
Reilly believes in Troy Aikman, and Aikman apparently has
confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was on the staff at New England for the past two
seasons, Reilly said of Aikman, ``I've seen him on film. He looks
as good as at any time in his career. I think he's still an
accurate passer, an effective passer. And the most exciting part is
that he's ready to go again.''
</P>
<P>
   The two, Reilly and Aikman, had lunch together last week. They
have played golf together _ ``He enjoys beating me,'' Reilly noted.
</P>
<P>
   You can trust that Aikman has signed off on all this. Reilly was
vague yesterday as to who actually contacted whom and when. But
Owner Jones confirmed that no one else was interviewed for the job.
</P>
<P>
   On the day last week when Campo was officially selected as head
coach, eyewitnesses report that Reilly spent the full day at Valley
Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   So who ``hired'' Reilly? Was it Jones? Was it Aikman? Does it
matter?
</P>
<P>
   Lest we forget, secondary coach Mike Zimmer was elevated
yesterday to Campo's old job as defensive coordinator. He shared
the table with Jones, Campo and Reilly at an afternoon news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   But with all deserved respects to Zimmer, my attitude is that if
it ain't broke, don't interview it. Fixing the offense _ not
tweaking the defense _ remains the major story of this Cowboys'
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly invoked the ``don't ask, don't tell'' clause when asked
yesterday if he had figured out how the '99 offense went sour.
Here's a suggestion for him: Ask Aikman. Bring lots of note paper.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, however, has the right idea. The Cowboys have a
well-paid talent nucleus already in place in Aikman, Emmitt Smith
and Rocket Ismail. Tailoring the offense around what they know best
is the prudent thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   If that fails, so does Campo. So does Reilly. And the
Aikman-Emmitt reign would be officially over, meaning Jones has to
start from scratch again.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Reilly is already repeating the company line _
attack, attack, attack. An attacking offense to go with an
attacking defense.
</P>
<P>
   It makes for an easy sell, not only on the players but on a
half-snoring Cowboys fan base.
</P>
<P>
   His resume suggests that Reilly can do it, that he has the
wherewithal to breathe some new-old energy into this wheezing
offense. The first step, after all, is getting Aikman to believe in
it.
</P>
<P>
   The next move is Jones'. Signing a free agent wide receiver _
Oakland's Tim Brown, for instance, whom Reilly has worked with _
would be a start. Drafting a receiver in the first round would be
another.
</P>
<P>
   Good players, as always, make for good coaches. But good,
motivated players make for even better ones.
</P>
<P>
   Who ``hired'' Reilly? It doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Just get This Old Offense fixed, or next time no one will argue
when Owner Jones does tear it down.

<P>
   PORT HUENEME, Calif. _ The Alaska Airlines jet that plunged into
the Pacific Ocean while trying to make an emergency landing at Los
Angeles on Monday appears to have suffered a progressive failure of
its control system, disappearing from radar about 11 minutes after
the crew first advised air traffic controllers of a problem,
according to a sketchy chronology given by the senior air safety
investigator here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, said John Hammerschmidt of the National
Transportation Safety Board, the crew members of the MD-83 aircraft
advised that ``they were kind of stabilized'' but asked that a band
of altitude a mile high be cleared for them.
</P>
<P>
   About five minutes later, the crew reported that the plane's
stabilizer was jammed, Hammerschmidt said, referring to the
wing-like horizontal structure on the tail that controls the pitch
of the plane up or down. Minutes later the jet crashed, apparently
killing all 88 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of Coast Guard and Navy searchers continued to scour the
deep waters off the Channel Islands here Tuesday, and said they had
detected underwater electronic ``pinging'' from one or both of the
plane's flight recorders. Investigators planned to use
remote-controlled robot submarines to make videotapes of the
wreckage, which is believed to be in water about 750 feet deep,
well beyond the capacity of human divers, before trying any
salvage.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Adm. Tom Collins of the Coast Guard said search teams had
conducted 51 computerized patterns over 36 square miles and by
mid-afternoon had found four bodies _ those of an infant, a man and
two women _ and more than a dozen boxes of mostly small pieces of
airplane debris, seat upholstery and personal effects, but no
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   With water temperatures in the mid-50s, there seemed no
possibility of survivors, but Collins said he would decide
Wednesday whether to call off the search.
</P>
<P>
   The crew of Alaska Airlines Flight 261, bound from the Mexican
resort town of Puerto Vallarta to San Francisco and then to
Seattle, radioed the controllers in the Los Angeles area about 4:10
p.m. Pacific time, and ``advised that they were having control
difficulties and descended 26,000 feet,'' said Hammerschmidt of the
safety board.
</P>
<P>
   That was an indication of a very serious problem, since the
plane was assigned to an altitude of 31,000 feet and was supposed
to stay there to avoid other traffic. A few seconds later,
Hammerschmidt said, the crew advised that the plane had descended
to 23,700 feet, meaning a descent of nearly a mile and a half.
</P>
<P>
   About 4:11, the crew told the air traffic controller, in
response to a question, that ``they were kind of stabilized.'' But
shortly after 4:15, the crew advised that the horizontal stabilizer
was jammed, Hammerschmidt said, and the plane was cleared to turn
south from its trajectory for San Francisco to make an emergency
landing at nearby Los Angeles International Airport. At 4:21,
controllers lost all radar contact with the plane.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines had said a few hours after the crash that the
crew had ``radioed a problem with the stabilizer trim,'' but
Hammerschmidt would not say Tuesday whether the word ``trim''
appeared in the preliminary transcript of the air-to-ground
communications. The trim is used by pilots to adjust the control
surfaces, like the horizontal stabilizer, so they will stay set
without the pilots having to apply constant pressure on the yoke in
the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that they were hopeful that they would glean
useful information from three or possibly four pilot witnesses to
the crash. One of those, the pilot of a SkyWest jet, was to be
interviewed Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Alaska Airlines has had only three fatal crashes _
including Flight 261 _ the carrier's maintenance practices have
recently come under federal scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration proposed last June that
Alaska Airlines pay a $44,000 civil penalty for maintenance
violations in its hangar in Oakland, Calif. The agency's inquiry
had focused on whether maintenance records on several jets in the
MD-80 series had been falsified and if engines on one jet had been
running at excessively different throttle settings.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the inquiry, the aviation agency had recommended that
three Alaska Airlines mechanics have their licenses revoked. The
mechanics have appealed, an agency spokesman said, but the
investigation has been delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, the FAA ordered operators of MD-80 series planes to
inspect the horizontal stabilizers for corrosion; the agency said a
manufacturing error ``could result in reduced structural integrity
of the airplane.'' The agency gave the airlines 18 months to do the
work, and investigators said Tuesday that they did not know yet if
it had been done on the plane that crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, with calm seas and brilliant winter sunshine at sharp
odds with their task, commercial squid fishermen and sport-fishing
boat operators who joined the overnight search efforts described a
battle against 8- to 12-foot swells, winds of up to 25 knots and
the sickening odor of jet fuel. Their grisly catch included
airplane debris, human remains and personal effects like Christmas
cards and cosmetics scooped up with nets and skiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Holland of Newport Beach, Calif., the 40-year-old skipper of
the squid boat Lil-Jack, was among the first on the scene Monday
and spent 12 hours there on his first tour. He found postcards and
love letters among the wreckage, but could not bring himself to
read them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want nothing to do with it,'' he said before
refueling his boat in the harbor here to head back out to sea. ``It
was kind of an eerie feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Ursitti, 37, the owner of an 85-foot sport fishing boat,
said he recovered about 400 pounds of wreckage and remains on his
first visit to the crash site.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most sobering things for me was coming across a
children's stroller, some toys,'' Ursitti said. ``It was
difficult.''

BUSH CAMP SAYS IT'S READY TO MOVE ON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Edits, inserts, thruout)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOFFSTOWN, N.H. _ Governor George W. Bush knew he was in for a
tough fight in New Hampshire. He was mindful of his father's
struggles here. He was even prepared to lose.
</P>
<P>
   But no one expected the bruising defeat of yesterday. And as
Bush tried to put the best face on his double-digit loss, speaking
to supporters at a post-primary rally just minutes after the polls
closed, the unshakeable confidence that surrounded his candidacy
was noticeably subdued.
</P>
<P>
   One adviser said Bush might need to retune his message slightly.
Another said the staff was mostly feeling ``disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   No one suggested Bush was in serious trouble nationwide. If
anything, the campaign was looking forward to the rest of the
country, eager to fly Wednesday to South Carolina to campaign among
voters who are far less independent-minded and unpredictable, in a
state that has turned out to support the Bush family for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Number one: erase New Hampshire out of your memory and move
on. Get back to the things that work. And adjust a little bit to
the things that didn't work,'' said J. Warren Tompkins, Bush's
Southeast regional director.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Bush strategist Karl Rove delivered news of the
disappointing exit poll results to Bush at 1:30 p.m. yesterday
afternoon, while the Texas governor and his wife were waiting for
poll returns in his hotel suite at the Residence Inn in Merrimack.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, quiet and resolute, first asked to speak with Senator Judd
Gregg, his state party chair. Then Bush gathered his senior aides
for a meeting to discuss what would come next, Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy who is steady under fire,'' Rove said. ``It just
made you proud to be associated with the guy. He said, `Nobody's
ever won this prize without suffering some rough patches.'''
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, with the wide gap between McCain and Bush
more evident, the campaign had honed its message: The Arizona
senator, they would say, had won through singleminded devotion to a
single state. He had personally greeted thousands of voters _ a
strategy impossible to repeat anyplace else. And he had none of the
resources or establishment support necessary to win nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Bush accepted defeat graciously. Arriving at St. Anselm College
here shortly after 8 p.m., he told a cheering crowd he had phoned
McCain with congratulations. He promised to carry the fight to
South Carolina, where aides he might employ tougher tactics,
including comparative advertising. He showed no evidence of being
stunned by the wide gap in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a long road. And I'm on the road. And the road is not
always going to be smooth,'' Bush said, his voice slightly scratchy
at the end of a day that began at 6:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Simple gusto was not enough to resuscitate the campaign of
Bush's father, George Bush, in 1980. Coming out of the Iowa
caucuses with an overwhelming victory, the elder Bush, then the
underdog, championed the ``Big Mo'' _ the momentum he hoped would
carry him through New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush lost to Reagan. His son was mindful of the loss. Just
before winning the Iowa caucuses Jan. 24, the Texas governor said:
``Big Mo didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet his expectations for New Hampshire were high as late as
yesterday morning. At one campaign stop, Bush told reporters he
expected to win. Last night, when it was clear quite the opposite
had happened, Bush's New Hampshire media consultant, Patric W.
Griffin said: ``I think everybody is disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in very good spirits. There's no change of plans,'' he
said late yesterday afternoon. ``If I told you we were elated,
you'd probably realize I wasn't telling the truth. He wanted to
win. But he's a competitive guy. He's got this in perspective. I
think that's the best way to describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate had spent the predawn hours Tuesday visiting five
polling sites and a restaurant in and around Manchester, part of a
last-minute push for support that began at 2:30 a.m. the Tuesday
before. He spoke as confidently as he had all week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to convince people on our team to vote, and the
undecideds to come our way,'' Bush told voters at a 6:30 a.m. stop
at the Webster School in Manchester. ``And that's what I'm going to
spend the day doing.''
</P>
<P>
   At the McKelvie School in Bedford three hours later, Bush was
asked to predict his reaction if he fell short in the primary.
``I'm a patient man. I've got a disciplined campaign. I've got a
vision for the future, so I'm ready for what comes.''

BUSH'S CAMP SURPRISED AT SIZE OF LOSS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds.: Changes throughout, new material.) 
(With NH-REPUBS)

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Gov. George W. Bush and his advisers were
never under any illusions.
</P>
<P>
   They knew that Sen. John McCain, who had put his entire
candidacy on the line in this state, could win. They knew that they
might wind up spending much of Tuesday night finding graceful ways
to accept defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But what took them by nearly complete surprise _ and guaranteed
that their efforts over the next weeks would be seriously
re-evaluated _ was the double-digit walloping that came their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unpleasant'' was the terse description that one adviser used
for the feeling when the first voter polls came in. His tone of
voice suggested that the sensation was actually worse than that.
</P>
<P>
   Another adviser said, bluntly: ``I think we were prepared for a
5-to-7 point loss. The dimensions of this are troubling. We worked
very hard. We wanted it really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their shock and disappointment, Bush's advisers
exhibited little worry that McCain's success here would be repeated
in the next big primary, in South Carolina on Feb. 19, or that the
Texas governor would ultimately lose the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, too, seemed upbeat and unbowed when he addressed hundreds
of supporters in a gymnasium at St. Anselm College here at about
8:20 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire has long been known as a bump in the road for
front-runners, and this year is no exception,'' Bush said,
referring to the state's famously quirky, contrary voters and their
habit of creating humbling surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Bush then made an oblique reference to a fact that his advisers
underlined more boldly: McCain had focused his presidential
campaign almost relentlessly on New Hampshire, spending twice as
many days here as Bush did, and had done so at the cost of building
organizations in states with contests to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road to the Republican nomination and the White House is a
long road,'' Bush said. ``Mine will go through all 50 states, and I
intend it to end at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bush and his advisers had, until the very end, held out
hope for a victory, and they had worked relentlessly to make it
happen. They marshaled about 4,000 volunteers to distribute
literature and place phone calls over the last two days. They
outspent McCain on advertising by at least $1 million. They even
brought in Bush's parents for a rally on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   So the results represented something of a wake-up call that
would shape the campaign ahead, especially in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign plans to focus greater attention on the fact
that Bush has been endorsed over McCain by 35 of the 55 Republicans
in the U.S. Senate. It is their way of answering McCain's implicit
charge, in speeches and commercials, that Bush is not ready to lead
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers also blamed themselves for not doing a better,
more aggressive job of debunking McCain's assertion that Bush's
large tax cut left too little money for Social Security, and they
said they would not make the same mistake in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   There were other strategies being considered and hatched as
well. Campaign officials in South Carolina foresaw a rally on
Thursday, in Sumter, S.C., to showcase Bush's extensive support
from veterans groups, a sort of counterpoint to McCain's military
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser in South Carolina, Warren Tompkins, also said the
nature of the debate in that state would be influenced by a
Republican electorate in which social or religious conservatives
made up 30 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therein lies a problem for McCain,'' Tompkins said. ``He has a
number of inconsistencies on abortion and some explaining to do. I
don't like to discuss strategy, but there are some obvious
differences, and I promise you the flops and the meanderings, we're
not going to let him get away with that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign's biggest insurance policy is money. While
Bush's advisers said that both candidates had spent around $1.5
million on advertising in South Carolina to date, Bush has the
financial resources to outpace McCain on that front from now on.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, however, Bush outspent McCain, and for all the
talk about the unusual sway of independent voters here, voter polls
suggested that McCain also beat Bush among registered Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   A few of Bush's advisers and several Republican analysts said
that Bush should have engaged McCain more directly and earlier in
the contest, and predicted a more aggressive approach from now on.
</P>
<P>
   But they said the results in New Hampshire suggested that voters
were choosing between McCain and Bush largely on grounds of
personality, and that it was hard to diminish McCain's story of
heroism and his appeal along those lines.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Warfield, press secretary for Bob Dole's 1996
presidential campaign, said Bush and his advisers faced another
potentially more serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Bush campaign didn't see this coming, what does it do
to the candidate's confidence?'' Warfield said. ``Obviously, the
defeat is a big external problem. But it can be an even more
disturbing internal one if it shakes the confidence of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers insisted that it had not and said Bush spent the
hours after learning of the first polls at 2 p.m. reaching out to
reassure his advisers and supporters that he was as optimistic as
he had always been.

WHITE HOUSE WOULD WEIGH DIPLOMATIC ISOLATION OF AUSTRIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to replace quote in 3rd graf.)  
(mk) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House officials said Tuesday that the United
States would consider joining the European Union in diplomatically
isolating Austria now that the Freedom Party, which espouses an
anti-immigrant platform, and the People's Party have agreed to form
a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council, said
the United States would weigh a range of options _ including
curtailing diplomatic relations _ if the Austrian president accepts
the Freedom Party, led by Joerg Haider, as part of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this should occur, then we'll have to make judgments about
what our next steps should be based on our own national
interests,'' Leavy said. ``This is an issue we're following very
closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider's party came in second in elections held in October, with
27 percent of the vote. Haider has called for a curtailment of
immigration to Austria _ ``over-foreignization,'' in his words. He
also advocates a halt to the expansion of the European Union as a
way to keep more Eastern Europeans from entering Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Most controversial, Haider has made comments, for which he
subsequently apologized, that were viewed by critics as playing
down the crimes of the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union, in an unprecedented move on Monday that
caught Austrian leaders off guard, warned that its other 14 members
were prepared to isolate Austria to make clear their opposition to
the Freedom Party's views.
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said last week that
U.S. officials had made clear in meetings with Haider ``our strong
opposition to any statements or any actions that might be
interpreted as expressing sympathy for the former Nazi regime or as
explaining away in any way, shape or form the terrible tragedy of
the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   An official at the Austrian Embassy in Washington would not
comment Tuesday.

AIRLINES `FAMILY' PULLS TOGETHER IN WAKE OF TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN and CANDY HATCHER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Thousands of Alaska Airlines employees had trained for
this. They'd practiced the disaster plan, divvied up tasks, tried
to anticipate what they should do if the unthinkable happened.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it ever would. Not to this company, which took such
pride in its safety record. Especially not to these people, who
embodied the resilient, resourceful spirit of the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, when Alaska Airlines Flight 261 plunged into the
Pacific, killing all 88 aboard, airline employees did a
double-take. Somebody's got the wrong airline, they thought.
</P>
<P>
   Then they somberly and methodically went to work, following the
disaster plan to keep the airline running. They talked to worried
co-workers and family members, rebooked frightened passengers on
other flights, dealt with reporters, brought in food, answered the
phone. Employees who'd had the day off came to work. Adrenalin
blocked out the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Day 2, however, was far more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers and the grief arrived at corporate headquarters
Tuesday as the loss _ five members of the flight crew, three
airline employees, four workers from Horizon Air (an Alaska Air
subsidiary) and 23 friends and relatives of airline workers _ hit
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family, camaraderie, togetherness, pride. That's what the
Eskimo on the tail is all about,'' said Todd Sproul, a customer
service manager at Alaska. ``When an Eskimo goes down, it's one of
your own.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash of Flight 261 stands as one of the greatest tragedies
in the 68-year history of Alaska Air, which has grown from a small
operation flying cargo between Anchorage and Bristol Bay, Alaska,
to the nation's tenth-largest airline with more than 9,000
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Tamayo, a three-year employee, was at home when a friend
from Texas called to check on her after learning about the crash
from a cable news station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to sit down for five minutes before I could even
speak,'' Tamayo said.
</P>
<P>
   When she arrived at Sea-Tac Airport, south of Seattle, she was
struck by the gestures of sorrow and support from passengers,
competitors and complete strangers.
</P>
<P>
   One man simply handed Tamayo 12 lottery tickets emblazoned with
smiling faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never mentioned what happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another passenger, a small child, drew a card for Alaska
employees while she waited for her plane to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   And a woman brought two bouquets of tulips to the counter as
symbols of love and support. One, she said, represented her son, an
Alaska pilot; the other, her daughter, an Alaska flight attendant.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what breaks us down,'' Tamayo said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the first day, Alaska employees gathered to talk
about what had gone well with the disaster response and what had
gone wrong. The meeting helped solidify employees' bonds and sense
that whatever happened, they would weather it together.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of the review session, they paused for a moment of
silence to remember the colleagues and customers who perished in
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional drain took a toll on Alaska workers as they began
to digest the tragedy _ its first in 24 years. It came less than a
week after the company announced the healthiest financial
performance in its history.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska also struggled with picket lines and an alleged sickout
by mechanics in 1999. But the airline settled the last of its labor
disputes late last year. The carrier was poised for a stable and
relatively calm 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Alaska Chairman John F. Kelly stressed
the company's strong sense of family.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the crash of Flight 261 has hit that family hard, it
will have a more muted impact on Alaska's finances, according to
financial analysts. That's partly because the airline has an
excellent safety record and a healthy balance sheet, they said.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed out that Alaska has plenty of cash to handle growth
and is continuing to boost its efficiency, increasingly relying on
on-line ticketing and other measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident that the airline will weather this difficult
period,'' said Peter Jacobs, an analyst at the Seattle-based
investment firm Ragen MacKenzie Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Alaska said customers would see no disruptions in
service because of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Employees, however, will struggle with the tragedy, said Thomas
Lent, president of the master executive council at the Association
of Flight Attendants and an Alaska employee. ``People, I think, are
going through these waves of disbelief,'' Lent said. ``It won't
takes weeks. It won't take months. It's going to take a long, long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Witter, Alaska spokesman, was preparing to leave work when
he got a call from a vice president. ``I think we have a problem,''
the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Witter began competing with TV, racing to break the news to
employees, struggling to get the facts to the media, trying not to
think about the loss. ``Always, in the back of my mind, I feared
this day,'' he said. ``And because we're smaller, the likelihood
that you know someone on the plane is much greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, it seemed, knew someone _ or knew somebody who knew
someone _ on that plane. ``You could hear the pain in the flight
op's voice when he read the names to me,'' Witter said.
</P>
<P>
   It's that small-town feel that separates Alaska from its
competitors, employees say. ``We don't fly 747s. We don't fly
wide-bodied aircraft. We fly up and down the west coast with small
planes,'' Todd Sproul said. ``That's what sets us apart. The
resourcefulness, the Alaska spirit _ the determination to go on,
even when it's 50 below outside.''
</P>
<P>
   And, employee Barbara Engen noted, the assurance that you're not
by yourself, that you're part of a team _ ``let's get through this
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelley Pauls, a seven-year Alaska employee who stayed at the
airport all Monday night, realized the enormity of the loss when
she saw the list of Flight 261 passengers. ``It was very difficult
to see five of the same last names,'' she said. ``You knew whole
families went down.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Sproul, a customer service manager, was driving home when
he learned the news. When he told his family, he said, there was an
eerie silence.
</P>
<P>
   His 5-year-old asked: ``What happened to the Eskimo, Dad?''
</P>
<P>
   Sproul told his son there had been an accident.
</P>
<P>
   But the boy keeps asking about the Eskimo, he said, ``and I
don't know what to say.''

FOR VICE PRESIDENT'S CAMPAIGN, NO LETUP IN ASKING FOR VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Edits, new quotes thruout)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ With the sky dark and just an hour to go
before the polls closed Tuesday, Al Gore was still out at the
polling stations, shaking hands and making a last-minute plea for
support.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, notorious for his wooden image, doesn't tend to show it
when he's rattled. But when mid-afternoon exit polls were showing a
neck-and-neck race between Gore and his rival, former New Jersey
Senator Bill Bradley, Gore raced back out to the streets to get
votes.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, the Gore campaign had insisted, was not
taking anything for granted _ not a single vote. And by the time
the campaign was over, a single vote victory would have pleased the
candidate who saw his support in opinion polls see-saw from far
behind in September, to comfortably leading in the week before the
contest, to what looked like a nail-bitingly close race on primary
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a hard-fought race like this, a win is a win,'' Doug
Hattaway, Gore's New Hampshire campaign spokesman, said as Gore
bought coffee at a Dunkin' Donuts for poll workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Al Gore needed was 1 percent more in New Hampshire,'' said
Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts. ``He came from
way behind when all of the momentum was for Bradley. If Bill
Bradley can't win convincingly here, where is he?''
</P>
<P>
   He's still around. Bradley, clearly disappointed at Tuesday
night's results, intends to continue campaigning for the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley challenge is an expensive one for Gore, who now must
face March 7 primaries in New York and California _ two states with
extremely high TV advertising costs.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley appears to have made some progress in questioning
Gore's commitment to abortion rights and campaign finance reform.
The two men share similar views on those issues, but Bradley
contends Gore has changed his position on abortion and has been
somewhat hypocritical on campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that there's much of a difference in what they have
to say,'' said Luke Martin, 29, wearing a long rubber tube on his
nose to ridicule Gore as a liar of Pinnochio-esque proportions.
``It's about honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Bradley has been a constant irritant to Gore, he has also
been good for Gore as a candidate. Bradley's relentless fight
against Gore ``made us stronger,'' a beaming Gore said Tuesday
night. ``This is a better campaign, a more focused campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Stung by a negative assault by Bradley, Gore became much more
aggressive in the last week before the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that aggression was turned on Bradley, as the two
engaged in a nasty, final week of campaigning. The Bradley camp
even accused Gore supporters of literal mud-slinging, when Senator
Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who backs Bradley, left a verbal scuffle
with Gore defenders with mud on the upper back of his coat.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had been behind in the opinion polls _ or in a dead heat _
virtually from Labor Day until the last week before the New
Hampshire primary, when his numbers surged. With a second win in
sight, Gore got fired up.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, whose baritone, Southern elocution and
endless chat about the budget surplus tends to make him sound as if
he's giving a commencement address to accountants, got
uncharacteristically emotional in the last couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He shouted. He attacked Bradley for ``negative campaigning'' and
for his health care plan. He stayed hours after open meetings,
promising to answer every unanswered voter question. He even hugged
a voter.
</P>
<P>
   He was, Gore insisted, ``a fighter,'' someone who would fight
for ordinary Americans as president. And while Gore still traveled
with all the accoutrements of a vice president _ Air Force Two and
Secret Service protection _ he was determined to convince New
Hampshire voters he was just one of the guys.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Tuesday that he was
concerned about the nation's rapidly growing trade deficit and
about the debt loads being carried by individuals and businesses,
but he said his worry was tempered by the strength the economy
derives from the federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview about the economy with three news organizations
on the day that the current expansion became the longest on record,
Clinton also gave credit to his Republican predecessors for their
role in promoting growth, but said that his push to eliminate the
federal budget deficit had been critical to creating today's
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   During the half-hour interview in the Oval Office, arranged at
the instigation of the White House, Clinton was expansive in
discussing the roots of the long business expansion, the problems
that face the economy and sparring between the two parties over how
to handle the growing federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   He brushed aside an aide's attempt to end the session to answer
a question about Vice President Al Gore's role in setting the
administration's economic policy, saying that the more people know
about Gore's involvement, ``the more credit he'll get.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he should get the credit for the expansion, which
has reached 107 months, Clinton said it was ``an American boom.''
</P>
<P>
   He ticked off factors including a general reorganization of the
private sector starting during the 1980s, the dizzying advances in
technology and the Federal Reserve's skillful conduct of monetary
policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan and Bush administrations, he said, deserved credit
for pushing a free-trade agenda. Doing so, he said, had forced
American industry to become more competitive, and by stimulating
imports had acted as a ``powerful brake on inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton stressed the role played by his administration's
efforts, starting in 1993, to reduce and then eventually eliminate
the deficit. He said he had built on that achievement by further
opening foreign markets, dealing with international financial
crises and overhauling the laws governing fast-changing industries
like telecommunications and financial services.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these things, even before they were actually felt, helped
to create a mind-set of confidence, which it seems to me is
critical for keeping the recovery going on this long,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what might endanger the expansion, Clinton talked about
the trade deficit and what some economists think is a worrisome
level of debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's highly unusual for a country to have a budget surplus as
big as ours and a trade deficit this big,'' Clinton said. Based on
figures for the first 11 months of the year, the trade deficit for
1999 is on course to reach $267 billion, about $100 billion more
than 1998, which was itself a record year.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I worry a little bit about the impact of the trade deficit
that big for a long time,'' Clinton said. ``That's one of the
reasons I hope we can get China into the WTO and open that market
more, because it's the biggest source of our troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then talked about the risks inherent in individuals' and
businesses' borrowing heavily in the belief that they can carry
more debt in an era when the stock market is making the country
feel wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about that,'' Clinton said. ``My concern is
mitigated by the fact that the government is in surplus and we're
paying down the debt and that lowers our risk a little bit _ quite
a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the money being borrowed by companies, Clinton added,
``will have a growth component to it and will increase the
long-term growth and stability of our economy'' because it will go
to investments in new equipment and technology.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said he remained concerned about the nation's
declining personal savings rate, which fell to 2.4 percent of
disposable income in 1999 from 3.7 percent in 1998 and 8.7 percent
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that no one seems to know how to fix in America
is how we get the personal savings rate back up,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can just keep moving in the right direction and realize
that this is a potential danger out there,'' the president said,
``I'm not as troubled by it as I would be if we were running a
deficit or if all this money was for consumer spending or if we
didn't have a better debt-to-wealth ratio than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton effectively confirmed that the administration is
dropping any pretense of submitting a budget proposal to Congress
for next year that sticks to the spending limits set out in the
bipartisan 1997 balanced budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has broken the limits in all but the most technical
sense for the last two years as surplus projections have increased,
and the two parties seem increasingly likely to abandon the limits
formally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to have fewer gimmicks in this budget than we had last
year,'' Clinton said. ``So what I tried to do is take the money
they spent last time and make it the baseline, and then assume a
reasonable amount of inflation based on the spending patterns of
the last five years or so.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, White House officials said, is likely to be a
surplus projection by the administration that is lower than any of
the three projections released last week by the Congressional
Budget Office. The budget office said that under assumptions
similar to those outlined Tuesday by Clinton, it expected the
surplus over the next decade outside of Social Security to total
$838 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Republican tax-cutting plans like the one proposed
by Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign, Clinton said they
risked sending the nation back into an era of deficits or painful
spending cuts. And even as he waited to hear the results of the
voting in the New Hampshire primary, Clinton took the opportunity
to bolster Gore's claim to having played a key role in formulating
the administration's economic approach.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the president said, had been in favor of moving in the
first term to reduce the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said that Gore had been a strong backer of stepping
in to help Mexico deal with its financial crisis in 1995 even
though it was politically unpopular at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Gore had not received more credit for his role,
Clinton replied, ``I think maybe it's because people don't know, so
maybe the more they know, the more credit he'll get.''

FOR VICE PRESIDENT'S CAMPAIGN, NO LETUP IN ASKING FOR VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Edits, new quotes thruout)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ With the sky dark and just an hour to go
before the polls closed Tuesday, Al Gore was still out at the
polling stations, shaking hands and making a last-minute plea for
support.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, notorious for his wooden image, doesn't tend to show it
when he's rattled. But when mid-afternoon exit polls were showing a
neck-and-neck race between Gore and his rival, former New Jersey
Senator Bill Bradley, Gore raced back out to the streets to get
votes.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, the Gore campaign had insisted, was not
taking anything for granted _ not a single vote. And by the time
the campaign was over, a single vote victory would have pleased the
candidate who saw his support in opinion polls see-saw from far
behind in September, to comfortably leading in the week before the
contest, to what looked like a nail-bitingly close race on primary
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a hard-fought race like this, a win is a win,'' Doug
Hattaway, Gore's New Hampshire campaign spokesman, said as Gore
bought coffee at a Dunkin' Donuts for poll workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Al Gore needed was 1 percent more in New Hampshire,'' said
Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts. ``He came from
way behind when all of the momentum was for Bradley. If Bill
Bradley can't win convincingly here, where is he?''
</P>
<P>
   He's still around. Bradley, clearly disappointed at Tuesday
night's results, intends to continue campaigning for the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley challenge is an expensive one for Gore, who now must
face March 7 primaries in New York and California _ two states with
extremely high TV advertising costs.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley appears to have made some progress in questioning
Gore's commitment to abortion rights and campaign finance reform.
The two men share similar views on those issues, but Bradley
contends Gore has changed his position on abortion and has been
somewhat hypocritical on campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that there's much of a difference in what they have
to say,'' said Luke Martin, 29, wearing a long rubber tube on his
nose to ridicule Gore as a liar of Pinnochio-esque proportions.
``It's about honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Bradley has been a constant irritant to Gore, he has also
been good for Gore as a candidate. Bradley's relentless fight
against Gore ``made us stronger,'' a beaming Gore said Tuesday
night. ``This is a better campaign, a more focused campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Stung by a negative assault by Bradley, Gore became much more
aggressive in the last week before the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that aggression was turned on Bradley, as the two
engaged in a nasty, final week of campaigning. The Bradley camp
even accused Gore supporters of literal mud-slinging, when Senator
Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who backs Bradley, left a verbal scuffle
with Gore defenders with mud on the upper back of his coat.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had been behind in the opinion polls _ or in a dead heat _
virtually from Labor Day until the last week before the New
Hampshire primary, when his numbers surged. With a second win in
sight, Gore got fired up.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, whose baritone, Southern elocution and
endless chat about the budget surplus tends to make him sound as if
he's giving a commencement address to accountants, got
uncharacteristically emotional in the last couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He shouted. He attacked Bradley for ``negative campaigning'' and
for his health care plan. He stayed hours after open meetings,
promising to answer every unanswered voter question. He even hugged
a voter.
</P>
<P>
   He was, Gore insisted, ``a fighter,'' someone who would fight
for ordinary Americans as president. And while Gore still traveled
with all the accoutrements of a vice president _ Air Force Two and
Secret Service protection _ he was determined to convince New
Hampshire voters he was just one of the guys.

EMPLOYERS PONDER MULTIRACIAL CENSUS QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A revised question in the 2000 census worries
some employers who keep track of the race of employees for
equal-employment and affirmative-action compliance reports.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990 census, citizens were instructed to declare their
race by checking one _ and only one _ box from among five options.
This year, multiple checks are allowed, increasing the number of
possible racial categories from five to 126.
</P>
<P>
   Because the earlier policy did not recognize biracial or
multiracial citizens, the government granted the new multicheck
option.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of obtaining a more detailed picture of race in the
United States is a record-keeping and compliance mess for
companies, according to some human resource experts.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the Society for Human Resource Management say
proving or disproving affirmative-action compliance depends on
statistical samples that are large enough to show patterns. They
say employers will have to retool their employee surveys to make
their race categories match those provided by the census.
</P>
<P>
   Molly Metz, a lawyer at Blackwell Sanders Peper Martin in Kansas
City, explains that companies doing business with the federal
government are required to prove their affirmative-action
compliance by comparing the racial makeup of their work forces with
the minority percentages present in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``With multiple-choice reporting, it's going to be difficult to
make any decent, statistically viable comparisons,'' Metz said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, employers have no specific guidelines from the
Department of Labor or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
as to how the 2000 race data will be interpreted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure if the government will break the data down into
the 126 possible classifications,'' Metz said. ``If they don't,
they'll end up with statistics that don't make sense because the
totals will equal more than 100 percent. If they do, the groups may
be too small to be statistically viable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherlyn Johnson, equal employment opportunity specialist at
Farmland Industries Inc., said companies were waiting for detailed
guidelines so they know what kind of race data to collect.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, chairwoman of the diversity initiative at the Human
Resource Management Association of Greater Kansas City, said
federal compliance officers sometimes suggested that companies do
``visual observations'' of their work forces to collect racial
breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be impossible with 126 categories,'' Johnson said.
``Observer IDs would be impossible, so we really need instructions
and procedures to follow to know how the government will use the
data and what it wants us to collect.''
</P>
<P>
   If the government increases the race categories for compliance
reports, formal resurveying of work forces could be expensive, said
Barbara Schneider, a principal at DeFrain Mayer in Overland Park,
Kan., who specializes in consulting on affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider said companies had a hint of the record-keeping
headache ahead after the 1990 census carved some job categories
into such small groups that many employers or geographic areas
produced statistically invalid samples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we'll be diluting the numbers even more,'' she predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Metz and Schneider said they had counseled their corporate
clients to wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recommend that anybody do anything right now,''
Schneider said. ``It may be five years before they put the census
data together anyway. That's what it took to get the 1990 census
done for affirmative action purposes.''

VOW OF TENACITY KEEPS SPIRITS HIGH, FOCUS KEEN

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Millions of Bill Bradley's campaign dollars
are gone. More than a year of his time was exhausted as he stumped
from living rooms in rural Iowa to factory gates in New Hampshire
mill towns. And by the end he was searching for new ways to prevent
incidents of the erratic heartbeat that plagued him along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bradley has just begun the campaign he describes as ``a
joyous journey.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, the preliminary rounds ended. Win or lose, Bill
Bradley said from the start, Iowa and New Hampshire were
waystations on the road to the ``national primary,'' the 15-state
prize fight on March 7 on which he has bet his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his drubbing in Iowa and a potentially damaging loss in
New Hampshire, Bradley and his aides Tuesday night said they never
expected to beat Al Gore, a sitting vice president, in the first
two contests.
</P>
<P>
   Knock Gore down if they could. Maybe win a round or two. But
stay alive, at all costs, for the main event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole new day,'' Bradley's spokesman, Eric Hauser, said
in a drafty arena at New Hampshire College, the campaign's election
night headquarters. ``Tomorrow begins the national primary.''
</P>
<P>
   With $20 million in the bank, an enduring belief in his ``new
politics'' of bold ideas and integrity, and growing acrimony toward
Gore, Bradley is about to wager that he can build enough momentum
to surge past Gore by the middle of March.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire polls showed him trailing Gore by margins ranging
from 1 point to 16 points on the eve of the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a remarkable turnaround,'' Bradley told supporters
in a rousing speech that was less a concession than a rally cry.
``But there is still a tough fight ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   In a musical symbol of the campaign's spirit, Bradley walked on
and off the stage to the Rolling Stones anthem, ``Start Me Up.'' He
was flanked by his wife, Ernestine, and some of his top allies,
including Minnesota Senator Paul D. Wellstone and Harvard professor
Cornel West.
</P>
<P>
   Moments earlier, Richard Goodwin, a former speechwriter for
President John F. Kennedy who is supporting Bradley, cited a number
of election surprises, including Eugene McCarthy's stunning
second-place finish behind President Johnson in New Hampshire in
1968 and McCarthy's defeat of Robert F. Kennedy in Oregon later
that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other parts of the country, they haven't even thought about
Bill Bradley yet,'' Goodwin said. ``Once they do, it's all
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Bradley cannot catch Gore by mid-March, Bradley has
acknowledged, his candidacy is ``toast.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, like Goodwin, believes the nation has yet to focus on
the election, that the fireworks of Iowa and New Hampshire have not
flickered beyond their borders. And he is hoping that his message
and his money, if not his momentum, can change his fortunes despite
Gore's lock on the national Democratic establishment and organized
labor.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's inability to break through in Iowa or New
Hampshire sets back his cause. Tuesday night, he set off on a
frenetic, three-day sweep through nearly half the March 7 primary
states, including the two top prizes: New York and California. He
was scheduled to hit Connecticut and New York Wedneday, then fly to
San Francisco for an event Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   He is off to Maryland and Florida on Friday, and he has stops
planned in New York Sunday, and Ohio and Missouri Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But as Bradley left New Hampshire, memories of his arrival
remained fresh. When he touched down at the Manchester airport at
3:30 a.m. last week after his loss in Iowa, Bradley told cheering
supporters, ``We came here for a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, he headed south, still hoping.

ALAN PRYCE-JONES, 91, EDITOR AND EMINENT MAN OF LETTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: R.I., Texas)   (bl)  
 By ERIC PACE  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Pryce-Jones, a London-born book critic, author and
journalist who was editor of The Times Literary Supplement, the
prestigious British weekly, for a decade, died Jan. 22 in
Galveston, Texas. He was 91 and lived in Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Pryce-Jones was viewed in the literary world with a mixture of
respect and good humor, the latter sometimes bordering on ribbing.
He was not only an eminent man of letters but also a very social
being, fond of tarrying with old friends and making new ones, some
with exalted status. In 1953 an article in The New York Times
Magazine called him one of the articulate writers whose company
Princess Margaret enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1972 essay Pryce-Jones wrote: ``Things might have been very
different for me were I not a natural enjoyer. In this I am unlike
most of my contemporaries who have made a name for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Pryce-Jones was well known in the United States as well as
Britain. Though he remained a British subject, he moved to New York
in 1960 and later to Newport. In addition to his tenure at The
Times Literary Supplement, where he was editor from 1948 to 1959,
he was a book critic for The New York Herald Tribune, The World
Journal Tribune and Newsday and a theater critic for Theater Arts.
He also wrote reviews and essays for The New York Times Book
Review.
</P>
<P>
   Pryce-Jones, whose autobiography, ``The Bonus of Laughter,'' was
published in 1987, knew most of the leading literary figures of his
day. He once wrote wryly, ``I have attained, if any standing, that
of a patriarch to whom strangers write asking if I have letters
from E. Waugh or if I have ever met the Sitwells.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents were Col. Henry Pryce-Jones, a highly placed British
army staff officer in World War I, and the former Vere Dawnay,
granddaughter of a viscount.
</P>
<P>
   Pryce-Jones graduated from Eton, where one of his teachers
wrote, ``Keeping Pryce-Jones up to the mark is like breaking a
butterfly on the wheel.'' After attending Oxford he was an
assistant editor of The London Mercury, another literary
publication, from 1928 to 1932.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s he also wrote several books. His travel book about
the Middle East, ``The Spring Journey'' (1931), won praise from
critics. Some other works fared less well.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II he was in British army intelligence and rose
to the rank of lieutenant colonel.
</P>
<P>
   He married Therese Fould-Springer, daughter of Baron Eugene
Fould-Springer, in 1934. She died in 1953. He married Mary Jean
Kempner Thorne in 1968. She died in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, David Pryce-Jones of London and a
stepson, Daniel K. Thorne of Galveston, Texas.

GEORGE KAHIN, EXPERT ON SOUTHEAST ASIA, DIES AT 82 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.Y., Texas, Md., Wash., D.C., Wyo., Mass., Calif.)  (jw) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. George McTurnan Kahin, an authority on Southeast Asia who
was an influential critic of Washington's policy during the Vietnam
War, died Saturday at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester. He was
82 and lived in Ithaca, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Kahin (pronounced KAY-hin) retired in 1988 after 37 years on the
faculty of Cornell, where he was a professor of government and
international studies. He was executive director of the Cornell
South East Asia Program from 1951 to 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the real pioneers in the field of Southeast
Asian studies,'' said Douglas Pike, director of research at the
Vietnam Center at Texas Tech University. ``He wasn't an ideologue
in the sense that some of the so-called historians we have today
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahin's book ``The United States in Vietnam,'' which he wrote
with John W. Lewis, another Cornell professor, ``was one of the
most influential books in the late 1960s'' in turning people in the
academic world against the American involvement in Vietnam, said
Frederick Z. Brown, associate director of Southeast Asia studies at
the Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins
University.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a former State Department expert on Indochina, said that
Kahin viewed Washington's Vietnam policy as ``the wrong war in the
wrong place at the wrong time.'' The book, which came out during
the war, ``was written as a textbook and therefore was written in a
style that was understandable, not too esoteric,'' Brown added.
``And it had a big readership.''
</P>
<P>
   In their book, Kahin and his co-author contended, ``The more
deeply one probes into the history of the U.S. involvement in
Vietnam, the more evident it becomes that a seriously distorted
picture has been presented.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vietnam is a single nation, not two,'' the authors argued, and
``South Vietnam constitutes an artificial creation whose existence
depends on the sustained application of American power.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nation called the book ``the most lucid and fully documented
study'' of the United States' involvement in the war. In a mixed
review of the work in The New York Times Book Review, David
Halberstam, author of ``The Making of a Quagmire'' (McGraw-Hill,
1965), praised it but said he was made uneasy by its ``blanket
declaration that the second Indochina war is simply an indigenous
rebellion against the repressions of Ngo Dinh Diem,'' South
Vietnam's prime minister from 1954 to 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Kahin figured prominently as one of the critics of U.S.
policy during a 15-hour ``national teach-in,'' on May 15, 1965, in
Washington. The protest was broadcast on television and radio.
Speaking of the American involvement in Vietnam, he said: ``The
trouble is that it's an artificial situation, and it's one that
can't be shored up militarily.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1966 declaration, he urged the Johnson administration to
make ``clear-cut and unequivocal pronouncements'' of its
willingness to have a negotiated settlement of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Kahin, whose doctorate was in political science from Johns
Hopkins, spurred the growth of Southeast Asian studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``George attracted the very best students from all over the
world, and they in turn became scholars in Southeast Asian studies
and started programs worldwide,'' said Thak Chaloemtiarana, the
director of Southeast Asia program at Cornell.
</P>
<P>
   But Pike said undergraduate work and, particularly, graduate
work in Southeast Asia and in international relations in general
had attracted fewer students in the United States after the end of
the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Kahin's interest in Southeast Asia began while he was in the
Army in World War II. He was among a few dozen soldiers who were to
parachute into the Japanese-occupied Netherlands East Indies, which
is now Indonesia. He learned to speak Indonesian and Dutch while he
was being trained for that mission, but it was called off, and he
went on to serve in the Netherlands and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   His many writings included book reviews and Op-Ed articles for
The New York Times. The George McT. Kahin Center for Advanced
Research on Southeast Asia at Cornell was named in his honor in
1992. He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Baltimore, Kahin grew up in Seattle, received a
bachelor's degree in 1940 from Harvard, a master's in 1946 from
Stanford and his doctorate in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage to Margaret Baker in 1942 ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 32 years, the former Audrey
Richey, who was the co-author of one of his books; a son, Brian, of
Washington; a daughter, Sharon Kahin of Cody, Wyo.; a sister, Peggy
Webb of Berkeley, Calif.; and two grandchildren.  &QL;

WITH N.H. OVER, GORE CAMPAIGN EAGER TO DISMISS CHALLENGER

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Thrusting his fists in the air in a Rocky
pose of triumph, Vice President Al Gore claimed victory in New
Hampshire on Tuesday night and immediately spoke of his lone rival,
former Sen. Bill Bradley, in the past tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley was a tough competitor who made us fight for
every vote,'' Gore declared to nearly 1,000 supporters in a
ballroom at a downtown hotel here.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, back in his blue suit and reading his speech
from note cards at a podium, cast himself as both underdog (``We
were behind in the polls for 14 weeks, we were outspent'') and as a
toughened competitor (``I think the contest made us stronger'').
</P>
<P>
   But his advisers _ who popped bottles of champagne in their
hotel suite adjacent to the room where the vice president and his
family watched the returns _ seemed eager to move on; indeed, Gore
was headed Tuesday night for New York to open what his advisers
call a ``national campaign'' beyond the small, boutique states of
Iowa and New Hampshire that have been the focus of the political
world for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has strength all across the country _ in the Northeast, in
the South, in the Midwest and the West,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's
press secretary, as the candidate, sweat streaming down his neck,
grabbed hands with his supporters. ``We're going to compete in
every single state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember,'' Lehane admonished reporters, ``this is Senator
Bradley's back yard. This is where he has been the strongest over
the last seven or eight months.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers said they were also thrilled with the outcome on
the Republican side, with Sen. John McCain's trouncing of Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas. It means the Republic battle will continue
and inevitably tarnish Bush's aura of electability.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Knapp, a Gore media adviser, said that the loss was
especially problematic for Bradley because if he could not win
here, he would have a hard time making his case to the rest of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an insurgent state,'' Knapp said. ``McCain won, he
lost. What's the rationale for his candidacy now?''
</P>
<P>
   Eager as Gore and some of his aides were to dispatch Bradley to
their memory bank, others suggested he was a useful prop for their
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want Bradley to drop out,'' said Tony Coelho, Gore's
campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho said that before Bradley was engaged in the race, voters
judged Gore in a vacuum, to Gore's detriment. ``We want a
dialogue,'' Coelho said. ``If he were to walk away, there's no
contest for us. We would have to create our own news.''
</P>
<P>
   As the returns came in during the day Gore aides were nervous.
``We were up by two and down by two,'' said one. ``Then we had to
maximize everything we had on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president himself went out at the end of the day to yet
another polling place just before the polls closed to show that he
was fighting for every vote.

 McCAIN BEATS BUSH: GORE SLIPS PAST BRADLEY IN N.H. PRIMARY  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Arizona Sen. John McCain, singlehandedly reviving
the tradition of reform in the Republican Party, overwhelmed GOP
frontrunner Gov. George W. Bush in Tuesday's first-in-the-nation
presidential primary here.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore edged former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley
in the Democratic contest, but Bradley claimed to have made ``a
remarkable comeback'' over the past few days and gave notice he is
very much in the race.
</P>
<P>
   McCain scored the biggest victory in any contested New Hampshire
primary since Ronald Reagan routed Bush's father and five other
Republican hopefuls in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   McCain took Bush by surprise Tuesday night: The Texas governor
received less than one-third of the Republican vote. ``McCain
stunned everyone,'' said New Hampshire GOP Chairman Steve Duprey.
</P>
<P>
   As supporters' cheers shook a hotel ballroom here, McCain
proclaimed that ``a great national crusade has just begun. ... We
sent a powerful message to Washington (D.C.) that change is
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the Republican Party has recovered its heritage of
reform,'' McCain said. He has campaigned as a champion of
overhauling campaign finance laws, curbing corporate welfare, and
using a big chunk of the federal budget surplus to pay down the
national debt. McCain has repeatedly said that his greatest
political hero is President Theodore Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   A trio of conservative GOP hopefuls _ millionaire publisher
Steve Forbes, radio personality Alan Keyes, and former Reagan
administration official Gary Bauer _ trailed far behind in the
primary. They collectively won more than fifty percent of the vote
in last week's Iowa GOP caucuses, which were dominated by Christian
conservatives. In Tuesday night's primary, the three took only
about 20 percent of the total vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' battle now moves to the Feb. 19 primary in
South Carolina, where in 1988 and 1996, the GOP establishment
buried insurgent candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Carolina is Bush country,'' the Texas governor declared
Tuesday night. Earlier in the day, he described the GOP race as a
``marathon'' and ``a long haul,'' and added that he is ``ready to
go find a warm place.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain has been making gains in the Palmetto State. The
former Vietnam POW is finding South Carolina's 450,000 retired
military and active-duty service personnel a natural base for his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One early poll gave Bush a 62 to 15 percent lead over McCain.
The latest figures show the gap narrowing to 52 to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential race then heads to Washington state, which
holds its primary Feb. 29 and precinct caucuses March 7.
Republicans will use the primary to pick one-third of their
national convention delegates, with the rest being allocated by
precinct legislative and congressional district caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is important as a precursor to the California
primary on March 7: We have our eyes on Washington,'' said Mike
Murphy, McCain's senior strategic campaign advisor.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has been very blunt about how it intends to
respond to the McCain firestorm _ with firewalls. One is Michigan,
which holds its primary Feb. 22 with powerful Gov. John Engler
pulling out all the stops for his Texas counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 25 Republican governors around the country ready to
put their organizations behind George W. Bush: That is the firewall
of firewalls,'' said Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is another Bush firewall. Rep. Jennifer Dunn,
R-Wash., who heads her home state's Bush campaign, Tuesday night
acknowledged McCain's New Hampshire victory as ``huge.'' But, she
argued, it is not decisive and Bush will win the remainder of the
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for Bush to be tested,'' Dunn said. ``It makes him a
stronger nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   No Republican president in the past 50 years has been elected
without winning the New Hampshire primary. Tuesday night, however,
Bush remained serenely confident that he is on his way to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign now leaves New Hampshire, but I will be back,''
he declared. ``I intend to win this state for the Republican Party
come November.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats don't pick more national convention delegates
until March.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's primary will be treated as a mere beauty contest,
with delegate selection coming out of the March 7 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore and Bradley will both campaign in the state. The
vice president will hold a rally in Olympia on Thursday and return
to Seattle on the 26th.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will campaign in Seattle next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As his narrow victory came clear Tuesday night, Gore appeared to
thank his rival for a spirited contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a better campaign, a stronger and more focused
campaign,'' the vice president declared.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a campaign taking nothing for granted. Rep. Norm
Dicks, D-Wash., a Gore confidant, said the vice president's
supporters have brought in 10 organizers who worked the Iowa
caucuses to pull together operations in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing, finally, the Al Gore I've known for 24 years,''
Dicks said. ``He's on message, expressing himself clearly and
fighting for what he believes. In a state with lots of blue-collar
Democrats, that message will be very effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, demoralized and grim after losing in Iowa last week,
was full of fight Tuesday night. He described the Democratic Party
as facing a choice between being ``caretakers of established
interests'' or being ``willing to honestly confront the ills of the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we, in a time of unprecedented prosperity, afford to dream
big dreams again?'' Bradley asked. He referred principally to
universal health coverage for all Americans and an end to childhood
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's big dreams of the White House will come true or be
dashed March 7, when 11 states including New York and California,
hold primaries and caucuses. A total of 1,300 convention delegates
are at play. Bradley is running even with Gore in delegate-rich New
York but is weak across southern states. He needs a breakthrough on
the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Bradley backers, Democratic Reps. Jim McDermott of
Washington and George Miller of California, predicted that
Bradley's reformist Democratic politics will play well on what
conservatives call the Left Coast of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is struggling with being part of the Clinton
administration.'' McDermott said. ``Voters aren't satisfied with
what has happened the last four years. They want a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Bradley issued a challenge to Gore for weekly
debates for as long the two men fight for the Democratic
nomination. Gore had earlier called for twice-weekly debates in
lieu of 30-second TV spots, but signaled he may go along with
Bradley's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Rep. Miller teamed with Bradley to force
Congress to overhaul California water laws that had benefited rich
agribusiness interests. They held up water projects across the
nation to force the cause of reform in California. ``In that battle
I watched Bill stare down the political establishment, the money
establishment, and scores of his congressional colleagues,'' Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he set the course, he sticks with it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign moves out of New Hampshire, the two insurgents _
Republican McCain and Democrat Bradley _ are very much contenders
in the battle for their parties' presidential nominations.

ORLANDO TARNISHES KNICKS' POLISHED IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Knicks' cast of star players had the polish and
pre-game praise rubbed off them by the end of the night after the
unassuming and threadbare Orlando Magic simply outworked them for a
convincing 98-77 victory Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   There was Allan Houston, named to the All-Star Game roster in
the afternoon, exiting the game near the 4-minute mark with an
unspectacular 12 points. There was Latrell Sprewell, the one coach
Jeff Van Gundy could not believe was left off the All-Star team,
departing the floor early with just 8 points.
</P>
<P>
   All of the glory went to a Magic team that contains no big names
nor a full roster thanks to a trade that was not yet complete.
Chucky Atkins scored 22 points and the reserves Monty Williams and
Michael Doleac each scored 14. The Knicks were outrebounded, 43-35,
and outshot 52 percent to 40.
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief sign of life, but the Knicks could not make up
for three abysmal quarters and ended up folding at the end. Their
point total was nowhere in the same range as their season-high 120
against the Kings on Sunday. This was nothing like Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With the Knicks down, 70-52, entering fourth quarter, Van Gundy
sat down a tired Patrick Ewing and unveiled the energetic Marcus
Camby. He was a major part of an 8-0 run that allowed the Knicks to
pull to within 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   But the Magic answered, and then Van Gundy's frustration got the
best of him. On a wild drive to the hoop by Houston that drew
contact, Van Gundy fumed that his player was fouled. He cursed
after no call was made and was given a technical by Bill Kennedy
with 8 minutes 23 seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   In another instant, after some sloppy play by Chris Childs, the
Magic were back on top, 77-62, after Williams blew by Houston for a
layup. With under five minutes left, the Knicks' inability to play
consistent defense or rebound allowed the Magic to take a 83-65
lead. That lead only ballooned from there.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks put in a dismal effort in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   As Doleac stepped back for jumper after jumper, Ewing was not on
the radar screen to defend him. As Bo Outlaw popped up for repeated
rebounds, the flat-footed Knicks were only bystanders. As Atkins
flew down the court only to pull up for jump shots, Childs was
backpedaling as he launched.
</P>
<P>
   While Larry Johnson hit 2 of 3 shots, the rest of his teammates
hit 1 of 14 and scored a team season-low for points in a quarter as
they trailed the Magic, 20-10.
</P>
<P>
   The second quarter started off better and at one stage, the
Knicks were within 3 points of the Magic. But after two turnovers
by Houston and a pass off Ewing's hands that elicited a thunder of
boos, they ended the half in ruins. The Magic, using a 14-2 run,
held a 53-38 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   And things only grew worse for the Knicks. They neither got back
in transition, showed the muscle to stop the layups under the chin
of Ewing nor grabbed a rebound. The energetic Magic, pressing them
the full length of the floor and outhustling them to loose balls,
had a 64-45 lead with 5 minutes left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was heckling every botched Knicks play, particularly
when Houston zinged a cross-court pass 5 feet over the head of
Sprewell. Nothing was coming into focus for the Knicks. After an
energizing alley-oop pass from Childs that Camby gathered in for a
dunk, the Knicks turned right around and gave up an uncontested
jumper to Atkins to diffuse the fun. In between, the Knicks blew a
fast-break chance when Childs hurled a full-court pass too far for
Camby, who crashed over the baseline table.
</P>
<P>
   It was a calamity as the Knicks found themselves behind, 70-52,
after the third. Where was the Knicks' resident All-Star? Through
three quarters, Houston had just 6 points. And how about the Knick
who was snubbed? Sprewell had just 8 points. The Knicks, shooting
just 36.8 percent through three quarter, labored for every point.
</P>
<P>
   This was a far departure from the Knicks' loose and fancy-free
66-point first half against Sacramento on Sunday. The Knicks looked
at the Kings as a challenge but were staring at the Magic with a
yawn.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this game looked easy enough on the surface. Orlando
was supposed to be the team that was spent and in disarray. After a
draining loss to the Phoenix Suns the night before, the Magic
arrived in New York early yesterday morning with just nine players
because of a five-player trade that was in the midst of being
completed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, the Magic sent to Denver guard Tariq Abdul-Wahad,
forward Chris Gatling and a draft pick for guard Ron Mercer, point
guard Chauncey Billups and swing man Johnny Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of staggering around the Garden, the Magic was the
sharper and more focused team on the floor. Under a sheet of boos,
the Knicks exited the first half after being outrebounded by 25-15
and outshot 56.8 percent to 38. It was embarrassing for the Knicks'
league-best defense. They were allowing league survivors like
Atkins and Doleac to take them apart as the two combined for 21
first-half points. &QL;

BROADWAY SET DESIGNER WILLIAM ECKART DIES AT 79 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.Y., Texas, Calif., La., Conn.)  (jw) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Eckart, a scenic designer whose innovative sets and
costumes enlivened many Broadway productions during the '50s and
'60s, died Jan. 24 in Dallas, where he lived. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Working with his wife, Jean, Eckart was a near-constant presence
on Broadway in an era when there were dozens of big-budget
productions a year, all in need of elaborate backdrops and bangles.
The Eckarts, who also designed stage lighting, found a special
niche with musicals, including the sets of ``Li'l Abner,'' ``The
Golden Apple,'' ``Damn Yankees'' and ``Tenderloin.'' Their sets for
``Fiorello!'' in 1960 and ``Mame'' in 1966 were both nominated for
Tony awards.
</P>
<P>
   In every effort the Eckarts tried to give their work a certain
sense of whimsy. ``We tried to do things that were light and airy
and that suited the character of each show,'' Eckart said in 1993.
In the 1964 musical ``Anyone Can Whistle,'' for example, the set
pieces did not merely move; they pirouetted and flew on and off the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   A Louisiana native, Eckart met his future wife and future
collaborator in New Orleans, where he studied architecture at
Tulane University. He drifted into theater, he said later, because
his fraternity wanted him to be active in something.
</P>
<P>
   After they both served in the Army, the young couple headed
north to attend the Yale School of Drama. In 1951 they broke onto
Broadway with their setting (the terrace of a Connecticut beach
house) for the play ``Glad Tidings.'' It was the first of three
shows they designed that season.
</P>
<P>
   The Eckarts quickly became favorites of the Broadway elite,
working with the likes of the director Harold Prince and the
producer George Abbott. The couple also dabbled in producing; their
first effort was ``Once Upon a Mattress,'' an Off-Broadway hit,
with Carol Burnett in 1959. (They also did the sets, costumes and
lights for the show.)
</P>
<P>
   The Eckarts designed for film and television, including the 1957
CBS broadcast of ``Cinderella,'' the movie versions of ``The Pajama
Game'' and ``Damn Yankees'' and the film ``The Night They Raided
Minsky's.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 they moved to Dallas, where they both taught design at
Southern Methodist University. Eckart was named professor emeritus
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Eckart died in 1993, but her husband continued to work in
theatrical design. Last fall, he designed a production of ``The
Illusion,'' by Pierre Corneille, at Southern Methodist, and at the
time of his death he was advising another designer for a production
of ``Macbeth,'' at a Dallas community college.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a sister, Rosemary Bernard of New Iberia, La.;
a son, Peter, of San Francisco; a daughter, Julie Johnson of
Dallas, and two grandchildren.

SENATOR CONTRADICTS CLAIM THAT HE'LL BLOCK NOMINATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John Ashcroft disputes an Oklahoma colleague's
statement last week that the Missouri Republican was among 18
senators who favored blocking President Clinton's judicial
nominations for the rest of his term.
</P>
<P>
   Upset by two appointments to federal boards in a congressional
recess, which sidestepped the need for Senate confirmation, Sen.
James Inhofe wants to put a hold on filling federal judgeships in
Missouri and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe's press release Jan. 25 listed Ashcroft as a supporter of
the move. Ashcroft's spokesman said Tuesday that was not exactly
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to encourage Inhofe and the president to respect the
Constitutional process, but he is not participating in holds on
nominations,'' spokesman Steve Hilton said. ``He will continue to
decide each case on the merits of the nominee and the circumstances
surrounding the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe and other Republican senators warned Clinton in November
that any recess appointments that were not agreeable to the Senate
leadership would mean retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has deliberately chosen the path of
confrontation, which was totally avoidable,'' Inhofe said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kennedy, a White House spokesman, said no agreement was
violated and that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott was informed of
Clinton's plans. Meanwhile, the judgeships must be filled, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The backlog of cases has gotten so bad that emergencies are
being declared in several parts of the country,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven nominations await Senate action, and 34 are before the
Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hoitsma, an Inhofe spokesman, agreed this week that
Ashcroft, a Judiciary Committee member, did not sign a letter
pledging to block appointments. Ashcroft, however, told Inhofe he
backed his efforts, Hoitsma said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft was an outspoken opponent last fall of the nomination
of Missouri Supreme Court Judge Ronnie White to a federal
judgeship. Ashcroft said White was soft on the death penalty. The
Senate rejected White 54-45.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has not put in a second nomination for the
judgeship. Another judgeship also is vacant in Missouri with the
death last month of U.S. District Court Judge D. Brook Bartlett in
Kansas City.

NEW COUNTRYWIDE CREDIT UNIT GOING INTERNATIONAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALABASAS, Calif. _ Countrywide Credit Industries Inc. expanded
its international reach on Tuesday, creating a new subsidiary that
will provide mortgage and real estate consulting for both domestic
and foreign customers.
</P>
<P>
   The new venture, Countrywide International Consulting Services
LLC, is currently considering contracts in Asia, South America and
the Middle East, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Lea, an international financial consultant and former
president of Cardiff Consulting Services, will run the unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're hoping to do is avail other mortgage companies of
American-style business models and functions,'' said Countrywide
spokesman Chris Carter. ``It's really along the lines of what you
would see from the large business consulting firms operating in the
U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   The unit will be based in Countrywide's headquarters in
Northwest Los Angeles County and will provide a range of services,
including technical assistance, training services, business plan
development and real estate market analysis. The new business will
hire more workers as needed, Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Tom Hain of Lehman Brothers said the move made sense for
Countrywide, a dominant U.S. loan company.
</P>
<P>
   By leveraging its expertise and position in the U.S. loan
industry, Countrywide can become a major player in less-developed
foreign markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a way to expand away from the relatively low growth
domestic market,'' Hain said.
</P>
<P>
   The company entered the international arena last year when it
formed a European joint venture with London-based Woolwich PLC. The
venture originates home loans in the the United Kingdom, but may
eventually expand into continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   That move was hailed by analysts, but few other U.S. mortgage
companies have followed Countrywide's lead, according to Hain.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has been great for Countrywide,'' Hain said. ``It's going

CONSPIRACY THEORIES STILL RAGE OVER LAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Religious duty, economic rivalry, cultural fric tion and the
vacillation of the federal government _ these forces have driven
the Navajo-Hopi land dispute for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   But some Navajos and their supporters also blame another, more
sinister factor: White cor porate greed.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the ``coal-conspiracy theory'':
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Navajo relocation charge that Peabody Coal Co. worked
secretly for legislation to evict the Navajos and clear the way to
strip-mine millions of tons of coal that remain key to the
explosive growth of the South west.
</P>
<P>
   This claim burst onto the screen in Broken Rainbow, a 1985
Oscar-winning documentary narrated by actor Martin Sheen.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, one non-Indian group flatly declares on the In
ternet that Navajos are being moved ``so that Peabody Western Coal
Company can mine their coal-rich land.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as flatly, Peabody spokes woman Beth Sutton denies it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying until I'm blue in the face that Peabody has
nothing to do with the dispute,'' Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
   The theory also exasperates Hopi officials, who say it trivial
izes Navajo-Hopi history. As tribal spokesman Eugene Kaye says,
``This land issue has been here a long time before Pea body.''
</P>
<P>
   An Arizona Republic examina tion found that no direct evi dence
that Peabody or any other commercial interests applied po litical
muscle during the Nava jo-Hopi fight in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And in the 25 years since relocation became law, thousands of
Navajos have relocated, but Peabody has not extended its mining
beyond the area it leased in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton said Peabody has more than enough coal under lease to
meet its customers demands far into the future. She rejects the
Navajo claim that the company has its eye on Big Mountain, the
center of resistance to relocation. Pointing out that Big Mountain
is 15 miles from the mining opera tions, she suggests that the
claim is geographically implausible.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Peabody's his tory in Navajo-Hopi country is open
to serious question. It is a history replete with apparent
conflicts of interest _ on the part of government officials, a
tribal attorney and a high-rank ing Department of Interior offi
cial who played a key role in the land dispute and then went to
work for the coal-mining com pany.
</P>
<P>
   There is also evidence that the company allied itself with the
Hopis in the early 1970s, when both encountered the Navajos'
aggressive new chairman, Peter MacDonald. &QL; 
A HEAVY LODE
</P>
<P>
   At the center of this swirling cloud of charges and suspicions
is Black Mesa coal, millions of tons of fuel that for nearly three
decades have been vital to the fortunes of Los Angeles, Las Vegas,
Phoenix and other major Southwestern cities.
</P>
<P>
   Five million tons annually come from the mine that lies on land
caught up in the Navajo-Hopi disputes. The mine flushes the coal
through a 273-mile un derground pipeline to the Southern California
Edison's power plant on the Colorado River at Laughlin, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Peabody takes an additional 7 million tons from exclusively
Navajo land to power the Navajo Generating Station at Lake Pow ell.
Operated by the Salt River Project, the plant sends much of the
power to homes around Phoe nix.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is co-owned by the federal government, which uses some
of the electricity to power Central Arizona Project pumps that
bring water from the Colo rado River to Phoenix and Tuc son.
</P>
<P>
   Peabody signed leases with the Navajos and Hopis in the 1960s,
after federal courts ruled that the tribes were joint owners of 1.8
million acres of land centered on Black Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   A 1964 article in the Oil and Gas Journal noted that the rul
ings finally opened up an area long believed to contain vast energy
storehouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than 35 years, oil explorers have been frustrated by
disputes over land bound aries,'' the article noted. The same was
true for coal compa nies until the two tribes were able to work
together to sign the Peabody lease.
</P>
<P>
   But that lease quickly came under fire for providing the tribes
with rock-bottom royalty rates.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Peter MacDonald was elected Navajo chairman and be gan
talking tough. MacDonald said he wanted to renegotiate with
Peabody. He also vowed to protect the environment from the mines
and power plants spring ing up around the edge of the Navajo
Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not turn our land into another Los Angeles, and we
won't let anyone else do it,'' MacDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Hopi tribal chairman was speaking as a friendly
Indian who would never dream of threatening the supply of
electricity to Phoenix air-con ditioners and swimming-pool pumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a real sense, we consider ourselves fortunate to have these
power plants developed in the areas around our reservation,''
Clarence Hamilton said in a 1972 statement.
</P>
<P>
   It is here, in Hamilton's ap proach to the coal issue, that
links emerge among the Hopis, the coal and the land dispute. &QL; 
UNCLEAR INTERESTS
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's 1972 statement, for example, was prepared by the Salt
Lake City public-relations firm of Evans and Associates. The firm
was hired by John Boyden, the Hopis' Salt Lake attorney.
</P>
<P>
   It was also Evans who, accord ing to the Washington Post, ``vir
tually stage-managed a range war on the borders of the Hopi
Reservation'' to convince journal ists that Congress must intervene
in the Navajo-Hopi land dispute.
</P>
<P>
   As the Hopis' attorney, John Boyden, was active in pushing
Congress to intervene for the Hopis. His list of clients included
Peabody Coal Co.
</P>
<P>
   Boyden's dual role represent ing both the Hopis and Peabody was
a clear conflict of interest, according to University of Colo rado
law Professor Charles Wil kinson. Wilkinson said Boyden's dual
loyalty could have compro mised the Hopis, pushing them to accept
Peabody's royalty offer.
</P>
<P>
   But it also could have given Boyden and the Hopis a powerful
ally in Peabody in the push for relocation of Navajos.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another potential link between Peabody and the land
dispute surfaced in the per son of Harrison Loesch, a U.S.
Department of Interior assistant secretary and supervisor of the
Bureau of Indian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   According to former Interior lawyer Graham Holmes, it was Loesch
who in 1972 changed the Interior Department's long-stand ing policy
of neutrality in the Navajo-Hopi dispute.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Holmes recalled that Loesch ordered BIA
Commissioner Louis Bruce to testify for Boyden's bill at a
congressional hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Fired from Interior in 1972, after Indian militants seized the
BIA headquarters in Washington, D.C., Loesch joined the Republi can
staff of the Senate Interior committee, which in 1974 passed the
relocation legislation.
</P>
<P>
   He later became a Washington lobbyist for Peabody Coal.
</P>
<P>
   It was during the early 1970s, critics charge, that Peabody was
working behind the scenes to assure itself the best possible deal
on its coal leases, regardless of the impact on the tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Alvin Josephy pointed to Black Mesa coal devel opment
as a prime example of federal failure to protect Indian rights. In
1971, Josephy reported that the ``negotiations and lease contract
signings . . . were car ried out so quietly that they provide a
classroom example of how serious has become the lack of
accountability by government agencies working hand-in-glove with
industry in the United States today.'' &QL; 
ROYALTY LAWSUIT
</P>
<P>
   Last June, the Navajo Tribe itself weighed in, claiming in a
lawsuit against Peabody that the firm conspired against the tribe
by hiring a lobbyist to derail a 1984 federal plan that would have
boosted Peabody's royalty pay ments at Black Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1964 lease, the Navajos were receiving a 2 per cent
royalty on the coal. But the lease allowed the government to adjust
the royalty rate after 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the suit contends, Interior staffers determined that
the royalty should rise to 20 per cent. But that proposal never saw
the light of day.
</P>
<P>
   The suit claims it was quietly killed by Interior Secretary Don
ald Hodel after Peabody hired as a lobbyist former Interior
official Stanley Hulett, Hodel's close friend.
</P>
<P>
   The Navajos, working without knowledge of the 20 percent
recommendation, agreed to a 12.5 percent royalty. They are now
charging Peabody with fraud and with subverting the Interior
Department's fiduciary duty to the Navajos. They claim the scheme
has cost them $600 million in royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Peabody and Hodel, now a consultant in Colorado, both re ject
the conspiracy charge. The company claims that in hiring Hulett, it
was merely exercising its right to lobby. Hodel claims he never
lost sight of his fiduciary role.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such denials, the law suit continues to make its way
through the federal court in Washington, where trial is pend ing.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the lack of conclu sive evidence against Peabody
Coal, the corporation's controver sial history makes it a
convenient target for coal-conspiracy theo rists. &QL;

007 FRANCHISE SAVING MGM STUDIO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER ROSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Agent 007 and a massive restructuring effort
helped drive Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. to its strongest quarter in a
dozen years, studio officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   MGM recorded its second consecutive profitable quarter during
the final three months of 1999, thanks to the impact of a new James
Bond flick, ``The World is Not Enough,'' improved video results and
a corporate overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Santa Monica-based MGM earned
$15.2 million, 8 cents per share, on revenues of $372.2 million.
This compares with a loss of $43.7 million, or 41cents, on revenue
of $383.4 million in the 1998 fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company ended up in the red for all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For the year MGM lost $530.9 million, $3.36 a share, on revenue
of $1.142 billion. In 1998 the company lost $157.65 million, $2.08
a share, on sales of $1.24 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 loss reflects a pretax charge of $440 million to cover
restructuring costs.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Taylor, the studio's senior executive vice president and
chief financial officer, credited the improved quarterly
performance to a variety of factors.
</P>
<P>
   One was the success of MGM films on digital video disc, a format
with fatter margins than VHS tapes; cutbacks in staffing and
overhead; and the resecuring of video and television rights
previously tied up in long-term deals to outside companies. The
rights were resecured without a cash outlay.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you exclude the performance of `The World is Not Enough' in
the fourth quarter, we still far more than doubled our ...
performance,'' Taylor said about earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Harrigan, senior vice president at Denver-based
investment firm Hanifren, Imhoff Inc., said the actions of new
management seem to be putting MGM back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results moderately exceeded expectations, by about $10
million. But more importantly, there's good momentum on the deal
side,'' Harrigan said. ``It looks like they've cobbled together a
nice film slate for 2001 ... and gone a long, long way toward
changing the limited talent relationships they've had over the last
two years.''
</P>
<P>
   This year started inauspiciously for MGM, with ``Supernova''
opening to bad reviews and sparse box office.
</P>
<P>
   On the television side, MGM's syndicated ``National Enquirer
TV'' has just been picked up for a second season, and two new shows
are being launched: ``Sexwars'' and ``Chatroom America.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest Bond film is one of the most profitable of the
decades-long franchise, collecting more than $320 million so far at
the worldwide box office. It is expected to continue to fill MGM's
coffers this year, as it is released to pay-TV and video. Three
other MGM releases _ ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' ``Stigmata'' and
``Tea With Mussolini'' _ also performed above expectations, Taylor
said.
</P>
<P>
   MGM outlined a slate of 14 films for 2001. Among them are a
remake of ``Rollerball'' directed by John McTiernan, a sequel to
``Silence of the Lambs'' titled ``Hannibal'' and the sequel ``Basic
Instinct 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Studio executives have high hopes for such star-studded upcoming
theatrical releases as ``Autumn in New York,'' starring Richard
Gere and Winona Ryder; ``Dancing in the Dark,'' with Antonio
Banderas and Angelina Jolie; and ``Heartbreakers,'' featuring
Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt.

BAUER, KEYES UNBOWED AS THEY CAST EYES SOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Quotes, edits thruout)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ ``It does not appear that the voters of New
Hampshire have endorsed me,'' conservative Republican Gary Bauer
told a group of 80 supporters on his final campaign night in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns had Bauer dead last in the five-man race but
vowing, albeit somewhat cryptically in the wake of his last place
finish in the Iowa caucauses, that he will soldier on.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to carry his conservative crusade against abortion and
moral decay at least as far as Delaware next Tuesday and perhaps on
to South Carolina Feb. 19, said his communications director Tim
Goeglein.
</P>
<P>
   Another conservative candidate, Alan Keyes, also is not letting
up.
</P>
<P>
   As he addressed gathered supporters Tuesday night in New
Hampshire, and looked likely to place fourth in the Republican
presidential primary here, Keyes sounded themes of a forward march
for his crusade of moral replenishment in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not discouraged! We will not retreat! We will not
hesitate! We will not vascillate!'' Keyes thundered. The crowd
cheered.
</P>
<P>
   As he waded into a cluster of supporters, the PA system played
``Mine Eyes Have Seen The Glory of the Coming of the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from being ready to drop out of this presidential race,
Keyes is leaving New Hampshire immediately for South Carolina, and
wednesday night will be rallying with supporters in a place without
snowbanks and with palmetto.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, a former United Nations ambassador and radio talk-show
host, has said he would be happy to come close to publisher Steve
Forbes' expected third-place finish in New Hampshire's
first-in-the-nation primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, a Reagan domestic policy advisor, spent the early part of
election day visiting polling places before greeting supporters at
an Italian restaurant in Manchester. There his campaign advisors
said the candiate was returning to Washington to rethink but not
necessarily to relinquish his frugal campaign to restore American
values, Goeglin said.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer saluted the people of New Hampshire and offered a
figurative tip of his hat to his party's winner, Arizona Sen. John
McCain. ``I would like to congratulate Sen. McCain on what was an
incredible showing tonight. A job well done,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes' New Hampshire supporters gathered Tuesday night at the
Capitol Center for the Arts in Concord for one last look at their
candidate before he headed south. Balloons were filled, bunting
hung, TV cameras dutifully assembled, little meatballs set out in
steaming trays.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes talked tough about New Hampshire winner Sen. John McCain
and Tuesday night sought to cast himself as the choice of
conservative republicans in upcoming state primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes' campaign has focused largely on what he sees as a
national moral crisis brought on by the democratic party, the
struggle against abortion rights and the reinstatement of God into
public life.
</P>
<P>
   Nona Davis, a Keyes supporter and volunteer from Concord, said
she believes in Keyes' message of morality. ``I'm so tired of what
we've had the last four years,'' Davis said. And no matter how
Keyes finished in New Hampshire, Davis said, ``he's already
influenced the campaign a whole bunch, and influenced the world.''

CAT WAKES FAMILY AS FIRE STARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUMMER HARLOW  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Doc the cat, howling, raced room to room at
his new home in the wee hours Tuesday, pouncing on his sleeping
owners and rousing them as smoke began to fill the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the rounds, taking a leaping jump onto the bed and
hitting us square in the chest,'' said Bryan Rouse, who had adopted
the people-loving Doc on Sunday from Wayside Waifs. ``It was his
way of saying `Hey, get up!' ''
</P>
<P>
   The 2-year-old cat is a hero in the eyes of Rouse and his
family.
</P>
<P>
   Doc's wailing alerted the five family members that their
Grandview home was on fire _ before the upstairs smoke detector
sounded. All escaped without injury.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Rouse, Bryan's mother, said at first she and her husband,
Russell, were annoyed by Doc's incessant howling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first night he tried to get into bed with us, and ended up
getting in a fight with another of our cats,'' she said. ``So this
time when he jumped on us we thought at first he was just fighting
again. But then he kept jumping from my husband to me, so we sat up
and saw the smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Doc bolted from Sharon and Russell Rouse's room to the rooms of
their granddaughter, 10, and grandson, 11. After waking the
children, Doc ran downstairs to Bryan Rouse's room. Rouse recently
moved to Missouri and temporarily is staying with his parents. He
is the children's uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a firefighter for 12 years, so it's a little unusual
that a fireman's living here but the cat saved the family,'' Bryan
Rouse said, watching his four-footed savior curl up for a quick nap
on the couch. ``He acted quicker than the smoke detectors, so he
beat the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Grandview Fire Chief Lorenzo Gigliotti said a night-light had
shorted out, burning the curtains and starting a small kitchen
fire. When firefighters arrived, Rouse already had put out the
flames. Rouse said an insurance adjuster estimated damage at
$3,800.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Rouse said it was her family's lucky day when Bryan
brought Doc home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've owned several cats, but we've never had one like this,''
she said. ``He sure is smart; he just made his way to all of us. I
had to look for the other cats to get them out of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Clemons, adoption counselor at Wayside Waifs, said when
Bryan Rouse called her Tuesday she was worried that he wanted to
return the cat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was something serious,'' she said. ``Sometimes we
get calls from people saying their pet is doing good, or that it
likes its new home, but we've never gotten any hero calls. You
mainly hear of dogs saving people's lives, but cats are a whole
different story.''

FOR VICE PRESIDENT'S CAMPAIGN, NO LETUP IN ASKING FOR VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects misslugging) 
(Edits, new quotes thruout)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ With the sky dark and just an hour to go
before the polls closed Tuesday, Al Gore was still out at the
polling stations, shaking hands and making a last-minute plea for
support.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, notorious for his wooden image, doesn't tend to show it
when he's rattled. But when mid-afternoon exit polls were showing a
neck-and-neck race between Gore and his rival, former New Jersey
Senator Bill Bradley, Gore raced back out to the streets to get
votes.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, the Gore campaign had insisted, was not
taking anything for granted _ not a single vote. And by the time
the campaign was over, a single vote victory would have pleased the
candidate who saw his support in opinion polls see-saw from far
behind in September, to comfortably leading in the week before the
contest, to what looked like a nail-bitingly close race on primary
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a hard-fought race like this, a win is a win,'' Doug
Hattaway, Gore's New Hampshire campaign spokesman, said as Gore
bought coffee at a Dunkin' Donuts for poll workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Al Gore needed was 1 percent more in New Hampshire,'' said
Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts. ``He came from
way behind when all of the momentum was for Bradley. If Bill
Bradley can't win convincingly here, where is he?''
</P>
<P>
   He's still around. Bradley, clearly disappointed at Tuesday
night's results, intends to continue campaigning for the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley challenge is an expensive one for Gore, who now must
face March 7 primaries in New York and California _ two states with
extremely high TV advertising costs.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley appears to have made some progress in questioning
Gore's commitment to abortion rights and campaign finance reform.
The two men share similar views on those issues, but Bradley
contends Gore has changed his position on abortion and has been
somewhat hypocritical on campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that there's much of a difference in what they have
to say,'' said Luke Martin, 29, wearing a long rubber tube on his
nose to ridicule Gore as a liar of Pinnochio-esque proportions.
``It's about honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Bradley has been a constant irritant to Gore, he has also
been good for Gore as a candidate. Bradley's relentless fight
against Gore ``made us stronger,'' a beaming Gore said Tuesday
night. ``This is a better campaign, a more focused campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Stung by a negative assault by Bradley, Gore became much more
aggressive in the last week before the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that aggression was turned on Bradley, as the two
engaged in a nasty, final week of campaigning. The Bradley camp
even accused Gore supporters of literal mud-slinging, when Senator
Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who backs Bradley, left a verbal scuffle
with Gore defenders with mud on the upper back of his coat.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had been behind in the opinion polls _ or in a dead heat _
virtually from Labor Day until the last week before the New
Hampshire primary, when his numbers surged. With a second win in
sight, Gore got fired up.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, whose baritone, Southern elocution and
endless chat about the budget surplus tends to make him sound as if
he's giving a commencement address to accountants, got
uncharacteristically emotional in the last couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He shouted. He attacked Bradley for ``negative campaigning'' and
for his health care plan. He stayed hours after open meetings,
promising to answer every unanswered voter question. He even hugged
a voter.
</P>
<P>
   He was, Gore insisted, ``a fighter,'' someone who would fight
for ordinary Americans as president. And while Gore still traveled
with all the accoutrements of a vice president _ Air Force Two and
Secret Service protection _ he was determined to convince New
Hampshire voters he was just one of the guys.

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ John McCain has been on a wild ride. Now he's
going to drag the Republican Party on one.
</P>
<P>
   The party that takes paternalism so seriously it was willing to
anoint the scion just based on his scionosity, must now deal with
the scamp.
</P>
<P>
   It's an ``East of Eden'' moment.
</P>
<P>
   When former President Bush came up to New Hampshire, he called
his son a ``boy'' who would not let the country down.
</P>
<P>
   McCain pounced on the word ``boy.'' ``I fully agree with that,''
he said, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   W. seemed to revert to a jittering teen-ager standing on stage
next to his dad at a country music concert on Saturday. It
underscored John McCain's case: Junior was a nice enough guy, but
did he have the experience to run the country?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone assumes the Bush machine will try to tear John McCain
apart limb by limb. But then, John McCain already survived that
fate far away and long ago. So he's pretty fearless.
</P>
<P>
   He went from being a rebellious son to a rebellious POW to a
rebellious senator. Eighteen months ago at dinner, he mused about
how much of a maverick was too much of a maverick to win the
Republican nomination. He knows, even with his rout here, it's hard
to capture a party whose leaders hate you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to restrain my delusions of grandeur,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His weird schizophrenic existence _ cherished by voters and
reporters in New Hampshire for his directness, loathed by
Republican leaders back in Washington for his directness _ was
illustrated in a funny exchange on his bus on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain turned to his friend, the movie actor turned GOP senator,
Fred Thompson, who had come from the nation's capital to campaign
on the ``Straight Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How are things in the city of Satan?'' McCain asked.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson replied that all was quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Then a reporter asked McCain what sort of reception he would get
if his campaign collapsed and he had to return to the Senate he has
so often stirred up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flowers will be strewn in my path,'' he replied dryly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something will be,'' Thompson observed, even more dryly.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign was devilish. The senator pointed out Tom
Brokaw to one town hall audience as ``one of the last Trotskyites
... left-wing, Communist, pinkos of the American media.''
</P>
<P>
   He reminisced about an exotic dancer he had once dated, when he
was a single flyer. ``Marie, the flame thrower of Florida,'' he
said. Asked what she was like, he replied, ``She was pretty
volatile,'' and then slapped his knee and laughed, ``Har, har,
har!''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate occasionally used curse words, usually foreign to
campaigns. He called himself a ``wacko'' and ``an old geezer,'' and
his answers often degenerated into jokes. Sometimes his answers
went over a weird edge, as when he teased an Air Force veteran: ``I
tried to get in the Air Force, but my parents were married.''
Complaining it was not ``manly'' of Bush to keep him off the New
York ballot, McCain started to denounce it as Communistic. ``I
spent a portion of my life under that system,'' he said. Then he
stopped and smiled. ``How's that for demagoguery? _ Here, you wanna
see my medals?''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Al Gore and Bush, who dole themselves out sparingly, the
Arizona senator offered a giddy excess of access to the press
contingent he dubbed ``great ferrets of truth.'' There was even a
teen-age reporter from Seventeen magazine, patiently waiting to ask
if McCain preferred Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, the man who loves to yak promised weekly yak
conferences. He also wants to start a dialogue with the Senate, a
la British Question Time.
</P>
<P>
   He was full of blunt answers. Queried about Bill Clinton's
legacy, he shot back: ``I think he'll be remembered as a great
waste. A great talent and a great waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was asked if he had given McCain any tips about
Tennessee, in case he ended up running against the vice president
from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never drink Jack Daniels on an empty stomach,'' Thompson
replied.

DES RENFORD, 72, ENGLISH CHANNEL SWIMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Des Renford, who began marathon swimming at the age of 39 and
went on to swim the English Channel in each of his 19 attempts,
died of a heart attack Dec. 31 while swimming in his local pool in
Sydney, Australia. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Renford was a butcher, a barkeeper, a bookmaker and a minor
local politician, but he is remembered for his duels with the
Channel. The challenge transcends the 20 miles separating the
Shakespeare Cliff of Dover and the Cap Gris Nez beach in France. It
is also the cold, foul weather and the sheer, unremitting
loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   Channel swimmers never forget the words of the first successful
Channel swimmer, Matthew Webb, who completed the ordeal in 1875.
``Nothing great is easy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Des Renford lived by that,'' said Kevin Murphy, himself a
veteran of 30 crossings and one of Renford's great rivals.
</P>
<P>
   For a time in the 1970s, Renford wore the title King of the
Channel, which is accorded the swimmer with the most crossings. One
of his swims ended in gale-force winds. On another, he was run over
by a Hovercraft but survived to reach France.
</P>
<P>
   His rivalry with two Britons, Murphy and Mike Read, became part
of the folklore of the sport. In 1977, Renford and Murphy agreed to
three races against one another. Murphy won the first, 10 miles in
shark cages in Sydney Harbor. Renford won the second, a Channel
crossing.
</P>
<P>
   On the last race, the length of Loch Ness, where the temperature
was at times near freezing, Renford was pulled unconscious from the
water after six and a half hours and put in intensive care.
Although Murphy went on another two and a half hours, he also
failed to complete the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed on an honorable draw,'' Murphy recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy was born in 1927 in Waverley in the Australian state of
New South Wales, and won a state swimming championship before his
10th birthday. In his teens, he gave up swimming in races to work
as a lifeguard.
</P>
<P>
   He pursued his other careers until at the age of 39 he became
interested in swimming distances. At 41, with very little training,
he entered a 24-mile race across Port Phillip Bay in Melbourne. He
failed to finish, but there was no one else left in the race,
either. He was awarded third place.
</P>
<P>
   While in his hospital bed, he decided to challenge the Channel.
He first succeeded in 1970, when he dived back in after reaching
the French shore and started to swim back to Dover. However, he
dislocated a shoulder when an escort boat hit him and was pulled
from the water.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Renford set out to beat the seven Channel crossings of
Mervyn Sharpe of Britain. He succeeded and became the first holder
of the Matthew Webb trophy. This stoked Read's competitive flames:
every time Renford swam what he called ``the old ditch,'' Read
would drive to Ipswich and do the same.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Read surpassed Renford with an unprecedented six
Channel crossings in a single year. Now, it was Renford's turn to
respond. He was determined to retire as King of the Channel. The
rivals swam again and again all summer long.
</P>
<P>
   Renford, who was so supple he could touch his toes with his
elbows, completed his 19th and final attempt without Read's being
warned it had happened. He then retired as King. Read later
regained the title, which he still holds.
</P>
<P>
   Renford, who is survived by his wife and three sons, sustained
two heart attacks while swimming before the third killed him. The
first was in 1985 and the second in 1987. He drastically changed
his diet.
</P>
<P>
   In its recent obituary for Renford, The Independent, a London
newspaper, told a story that suggests the surreal quality of
swimming back and forth across the English Channel. It happened on
a cold, foggy night in 1973. Renford was swimming furiously against
the tide and hypothermia had set in. Finally, he stumbled to shore
and collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   His crew scurried around with blankets and hot tea, trying to
raise his body temperature, which had fallen dangerously low.
Unfazed by the activity, a dog walker asked, ``Been swimming,
then?''
</P>
<P>
   The blue-lipped Renford managed to nod yes. ``Jolly good show,''
the man said as he and his dog disappeared in the fog.

NON-INDIAN INVOLVEMENT REMAINS CONTROVERSIAL  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her laptop is powered by a windmill generator. Her workplace is
a tiny mobile home dropped into the vast ex panse of northeastern
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Marsha Monestersky turns on her computer and taps into a
decades-long wave of in ternational protest over an issue most
Americans have never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   A former student radical and labor organizer, Monestersky calls
herself a ``consultant'' to the Sovereign Dine Nation _ as some
Navajos resisting reloca tion label themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At 47, she's perhaps the most visible member of an interna
tional community of non-Indians protesting relocation.
</P>
<P>
   She's also the most controver sial.
</P>
<P>
   Monestersky's presence here points up the sensitive issue of
non-Indian involvement in this long-running Native American land
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Some Navajos who resist loca tion praise her.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your back is against the wall,'' said Marie Gladue of Big
Mountain, ``you look for support wherever you can find it.''
</P>
<P>
   Others call her a troublemaker who has exploited the Navajos
while posing as their savior.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is like a bowling ball. She just destroys things,'' said
Helena Begay, who says Monestersky has divided families and stirred
conflict across the disputed land.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, she embodies the passion outsiders from around the
world have felt for this relatively obscure clash over an isolated,
starkly beautiful land that is sacred ground to the Navajos and
Hopis.
</P>
<P>
   Such critics have demon strated on the East and West Coasts,
picketed U.S. embassies in Japan and several European countries,
and organized a letter-writing campaign to warn Con gress that
relocation ``can only bring further tragedy and na tional
disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Flagstaff-based Black Mesa Indigenous Support
has sent dozens of young volunteers to herd sheep, chop wood and
haul water for the elderly resisters.
</P>
<P>
   The organization also assisted several dozen Europeans and
Japanese who came to protest Tuesday's relocation deadline for
Navajos who live on Hopi land and have refused to sign an
``accommodation agreement'' _ or AA _ with the Hopi Tribe.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors were lured in part by overheated Internet rumors.
</P>
<P>
   A Minnesota group warned last month that mass evictions were
imminent. Others have predicted that Black Mesa is about to become
``the next Waco,'' with federal marshals moving in to evict the
resisters.
</P>
<P>
   Such rhetoric prompted Hopi leaders and federal officials to
declare earlier last month that there will be no evictions any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   They will, however, seek evic tion orders through the courts.
That process is expected to take at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Harald Mueller has come from Germany with his wife and
two small children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the side of the human rights,'' Mueller said. He
acknowledged that he hasn't been able to study the complex history
of the Navajo-Hopi dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just think it is a human-rights violation to relocate these
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Goes of Sweden's Green Party said she came to the dis puted
land as a human-rights observer. She condemned reloca tion as
``cultural genocide'' and pledged to take the resisters' stories to
the European Parlia ment.
</P>
<P>
   Monestersky, Mueller and Goes are continuing a tradition of
protest against the 1974 federal law that is pushing Navajos off
nearly a million acres of land long claimed by the Hopis.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, a group called the Big Mountain Legal
Offense-Defense Committee was sending out 20,000 copies of its
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   The group warned that unless Congress repealed the law, relo
cation ``will add yet another chapter to the disgraceful history of
abuse that Indians have suf fered at the hands of the U.S.
government.''
</P>
<P>
   The repeal effort failed. But the protesters helped Navajos file
a federal lawsuit that became the starting point for a 1996
agreement that allows Navajos to stay if they accept Hopi jurisdic
tion.
</P>
<P>
   Monestersky has told resisters that if they reject the
agreement, they may yet win back their land. She is working with
lawyers who promise to do all they can but who apparently lack a
concrete strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But Betty Tso, a Navajo tribal employee who works with sign ers
of the agreement, fears fur ther resistance will only produce more
heartache.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Marsha is offering them a false hope,'' said Tso,
whose mother signed the agree ment after years of protest.
</P>
<P>
   Monestersky's activism has an tagonized the Hopi Tribe, which
has asked the tribal court to banish her from the reservation. Her
trial is set for March.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are Navajo officials sup portive.
</P>
<P>
   Navajo President Kelsey Be gaye, a strong critic of reloca tion,
has said repeatedly he thinks the outsiders should leave.
</P>
<P>
   Begaye also said those who resist relocation fail to under stand
that there is no real pros pect for a repeal of the federal
relocation law.
</P>
<P>
   While eviction would be ``a bitter pill to swallow,'' he said,
it may be inevitable. &QL;

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ All day long, as the voters of New Hampshire
pulled levers, the commentators on television dropped hints about
the likely outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, they even got their verb tenses wrong, offering,
in the hours before the polls closed, past-tense reflections on how
the candidates had done in an election that was yet to be decided.
But more often, they simply offered variations on similar themes.
</P>
<P>
   It happened on the Fox News Channel at about 4:15 p.m. EST, when
former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said of Sen. John McCain, ``I
think he's going to surprise people and win by 8 to 12 points.''
</P>
<P>
   It happened an hour later on MSNBC, when Mary Anne Marsh, a
Democratic strategist, suggested the Democratic contest ``might be
a lot closer race than people think.''
</P>
<P>
   And it happened at 6 p.m., when the NBC correspondent Lisa Myers
said on Andrea Mitchell's new political talk show on MSNBC that one
of the questions facing Gov. George W. Bush's campaign was ``how he
faces a loss, particularly if he loses big.''
</P>
<P>
   What the news divisions were aware of all afternoon at these
networks _ as well as at newspapers like The New York Times _ was
that the first results of the exit surveys conducted by a
collectively-administered polling organization were showing McCain
was leading by a large margin, the Democrats were locked in a close
race and Bush was facing a big loss.
</P>
<P>
   When most New Hampshire polls closed at 7 p.m., the early hints
were confirmed: Fox, MSNBC and CNN instantly called the Republican
race a resounding victory for McCain and the Democratic contest too
close to call; CNN called the race for Gore about 8:45 p.m., and
several other cable and broadcast networks followed.
</P>
<P>
   Because some polls in the state remained open until 8 p.m.,
local stations like WMUR-TV in Manchester, an ABC affiliate and New
Hampshire's dominant news station, took the position that the races
should not be called until the voting ended.
</P>
<P>
   So they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Coverage of the Alaska Airlines crash in the Pacific competed
with political updates throughout the day. Still, the cable news
channels _ the emerging dominant force in campaign coverage on
television this year _ filled several hours before the polls closed
with stories and commentary that went beyond the traditional
boundaries of Election Day stories.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the usual reports citing heavy voter turnout and the
first-in-the-state returns from Dixville Notch, these highly
competitive channels came very close to calling the races.
</P>
<P>
   How much attention New Hampshire voters paid to the glut of
horse-race reportage and prognostication in the final days of the
election is unclear. In Tuesday's exit poll conducted by the Voter
News Service, about 25 percent of Republican voters said they
decided over the last three days which lever they would pull.
</P>
<P>
   As for other media influences, about a third of those who voted
for Democrats said that the candidates' commercials affected their
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   As they left their polling place at a high school in Londonderry
on Tuesday, several voters said the news media in general and
television news in particular had helped them make their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the media said that independents could make a difference,
that got me out to vote,'' said John Bartlett, who described
himself as a political independent who usually votes for Democrats.
Tuesday, however, he voted for McCain, and he cited the polls as a
motivating factor. ``The closer Bush got to McCain, the more I
wanted to vote,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bethany Gordon, an 18-year-old student at Londonderry High
School and a supporter of Bill Bradley, said she interpreted the
recent coverage of the Democratic campaign as reflecting poorly on
Vice President Al Gore. ``I heard it, and I believed it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Pat Sheridan, a retired newspaper pressman, said he came to
the opposite conclusion from television coverage. ``It played a big
part,'' he said, in explaining how he decided to vote for Gore.
``The worst thing that came across the television is how weak
Bradley comes across.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Election night on television was markedly different from eight
days earlier, in Iowa, where a desultory evening of reporting
lacked much snap. Tuesday night, however, the anchors seemed more
convinced themselves of their repeated pronouncements that the
evening's developing story, the prospect of a continuing race on
both sides, was ``exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are preparing here for a bruising five weeks,'' declared
John King, CNN's correspondent at Gore's campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   His CNN colleague, Judy Woodruff, betrayed a slight case of
guilt over the breathless pace of declaring winners before all the
voters had their say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still some New Hampshire voters making their way to
the polls,'' Ms. Woodruff announced about 20 minutes after her
network called the Republican race. ``This election isn't over
yet.''

NEW PRESSURE FOR GUN CONTROL  (jw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Feb. 2:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has moved the nation's gun control debate an
important step forward with his State of the Union proposal for a
national system of photo licensing and safety testing for handgun
buyers. The proposal puts fresh political pressures on an
indifferent Republican Congress, which has yet to approve the more
modest gun control measures the administration called for last
spring following the Colorado school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan _ identical to Vice President Al Gore's campaign
proposal _ would essentially treat handgun ownership as seriously
as society treats the licensing of drivers. The president could
make a good plan even better by requiring not only licensing of
buyers but also the registration of all handguns themselves,
including the tens of millions now in circulation. That is the
course urged by Gore's Democratic opponent, Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects this Congress to approve a dramatic overhaul of
existing regulations. But the Republicans should at least be
willing to hold hearings on the Clinton plan's common-sense
provisions. One would require buyers to show that they can handle a
weapon safely. Buyers would also have to show that they are aware
of their legal responsibility to keep loaded guns away from
children. Clinton has also requested $280 million to better enforce
existing gun laws _ a deft response to complaints from the gun
lobby that too little is done to enforce laws already on the books.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control will obviously be an issue in the fall elections.
During the State of the Union speech, Republican lawmakers stood up
to honor Tom Mauser, who lost his son, Daniel, in the Columbine
High School massacre. But not many clapped when Clinton called for
meaningful action to prevent similar tragedies in the future. That
sort of duplicity seems unlikely to sit well with voters.

STUDENTS STRUGGLE TO UNDERSTAND DEATH OF CLASSMATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REBEKAH DENN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In the outsized printed letters of a first-grade
student, Rachel Pearson wrote down her dream for the new
millennium: that it would snow every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we could make snowmen and play with friends outside every
day,'' the 6-year-old wrote in a January class assignment, still
posted on the wall at John Hay Elementary Tuesday. ``That would be
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just one heartbreaking reminder at the small Queen Anne
school as staff, parents, and students absorbed the thought that
Rachel and three of her classmates would never see their dreams
come true.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel and classmates Blake, Miles, and Coriander Clemetson were
aboard the Alaska Airlines flight that crashed Monday off
California. Coriander was one of 78 second-graders at the school;
the other three were among the 82 first-graders. The two families
were friends who were vacationing together.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Public Schools staff knew that, with 47 Seattle
residents aboard the flight, they might feel the ripples. The crash
``makes our big city a small town,'' Superintendent Joseph
Olchefske said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the thought that one school could be hit four times
seemed unspeakably cruel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts are aching,'' Hay Principal Joanne Testa-Cross said
at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members and parents were briefed by child psychologists at
Hay Tuesday, and teachers spent time in their classrooms talking
with students about their missing classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult, very, very painful for the staff.
They're having to deal with their own grief, and then the real
challenge of having to explain it to all these kids,'' said
Olchefske, whose own daughter attends kindergarten at Hay.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a lot of kids where these were their best
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Student reactions ranged from technical questions about the
flight to writing letters to their lost friends to simply saying
``I miss them,'' Testa-Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   Others drew pictures. ``I saw an airplane that had `Heaven'
written on it, with a phone number,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The loss wasn't isolated to the school, but was woven in the
entire Queen Anne community.
</P>
<P>
   Families know each other ``from the playground, from the
preschool, from the bagel shop, from just being neighbors,'' said
Glenn Baker, who counted David Clemetson _ father of Blake, Miles
and Coriander _ as his closest friend. Baker went mountain biking
with Clemetson and Rodney Pearson _ Rachel's dad _ and another
friend every Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said his friends told him last week that they were
skipping the tradition this past Sunday because of their Puerto
Vallarta trip.
</P>
<P>
   Baker remembers telling Clemetson that he wished the flights
would be cancelled so they could keep their regular date.
</P>
<P>
   All the Clemetsons were ``so colorful and so full of life,''
Baker said, and David Clemetson, especially, was ``super, super
playful.''
</P>
<P>
   All four of the Hay students aboard the flight ``were smiling,
wonderful children,'' Testa-Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   As the Coast Guard search was still active Tuesday, teachers
didn't talk about death, but instead explained that the search is
ongoing but that no survivors have been found. Psychologists will
be available at the school at least through next week.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard for Carol Briant, a friend of the Clemetsons and
Pearsons, to explain the news to her own daughter, who also attends
Hay and wanted to know who would feed the Clemetson's dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most difficult part is knowing they can't
understand fully. It comes to them in little bits, in little
bubbles,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The school looked almost normal from the outside Tuesday, with
cut-out paper snowflakes and flowers taped to windows. Inside, the
pictures and student work adorned the hallway, where staff members
and parents embraced and exchanged tears.
</P>
<P>
   At one end of the hall, a collection of brown construction paper
owls showed that second-grade students had learned the vowel sound
``ow.'' One had Coriander Clemetson's name printed on it, dated
just last week.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, accompanying Rachel Pearson's millennium
essay, was a smiling photo of the gap-toothed girl, along with her
crayon illustration _ two girls in red shirts waving their arms in
joy at a shower of snow.
