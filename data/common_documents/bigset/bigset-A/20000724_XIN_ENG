<HEADLINE> Indonesian Vice-President on Sino-Indonesian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Vice-President Megawati
Soekarnoputry said here Sunday that the relationship between
Indonesia and China is important and hoped the ties will be better
and better in the future.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, she stressed that the
ongoing official visit of Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao to
Indonesia is an important step to make the Sino-Indonesian ties
much stronger.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao arrived in Indonesia on
Saturday afternoon for a four-day official visit to Indonesia, the
third leg of his current five-nation tour, at the invitation of
Indonesian Vice-President Megawati Soekarnoputri.
</P>
<P>
Megawati said, "Of course, I am very happy with the visit of
Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao to Indonesia. This is the first
visit of the Chinese leader after the formation of the new
government of Indonesia. This, I hope will make the relationship
between the two countries much better and will be beneficial to
the development of China-Indonesia relationship."
</P>
<P>
Megawati also said that there are actually no significant
barriers in enhancing the ties between Indonesia and China.
</P>
<P>
"So far, our relations with China have a strong foundation. And
since 1955, when the Asia-Africa Conference took place, the
relations between the two countries have been well. Maybe we have
some differences, but I am optimistic, that is not a significant
thing. And we will be able to deal with that. I don't see there
are major obstacles which may hamper the relations between
Indonesia and China," she said.
</P>
<P>
There are cultural similarities between Chinese and Indonesians,
she added.
</P>
<P>
She also said that Indonesia and China play a significant role
in maintaining political stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
"I also hope that China will give its support to Indonesia in a
bid to maintain the territorial integrity from disintegration
threats," she added.
</P>
<P>
In connection with Taiwan issue, Megawati insisted that
Indonesia will stick to its "One China Policy". She viewed Taiwan
as a domestic affair of the Chinese government. "For me that is
the Chinese government affair. We will be consistent with 'One
China Policy'. But we hope that this problem can be settled
peacefully," Megawati added.
</P>
<P>
In tourism sector, Megawati said that the Indonesian government
will hammer out a plan to attract Chinese tourists to come to
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"We admit that we still have a little problem in that point.
The number of Chinese tourists visiting Indonesia is still lower
compared with the number of Chinese tourists visiting Malaysia or
Thailand. But in a bid to attract more Chinese tourists, I hope
that the Chinese government will declare Indonesia as a tourist
destination for its people," she said.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Triumphs for Second Straight Tour de France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Lance Armstrong of the United States
clinched his second straight Tour de France title Sunday to
confirm his status as the world's top cyclist with one of sport's
most moving comeback stories, accorting to reports.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Armstrong arrived in the main pack of riders
with his commanding overall lead of 6 minutes, 2 seconds to
Germany's Jan Ullrich still intact.
</P>
<P>
The pack circled the grand boulevard a dozen times, gaining
speed and urgency with each potentially dangerous bend in front of
the Arc de Triomphe, before crossing the finish line to end the
day's 138-kilometer circuit of central Paris.
</P>
<P>
A small band of sprinters darted ahead of the main pack to
compete for the honor of winning the final stage. Stefano
Zaniniprevailed with a time of three hours, 12 minutes and 36
seconds. Erik Zabel of Deutsche Telekom came in second with the
same time, and Romans Vainsteins of Latvia in third.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong came 76th in this final 21st stage.
</P>
<P>
One hundred eighty cyclists set out July 1 to win cycling's
most coveted honor completed the 3,630-kilometer epic across
swathes of France, Switzerland and Germany.
</P>
<P>
There had been little doubt that Armstrong would repeat as
champion as the riders arrived in Paris on board a special Orient
Express train service from Troyes, the hub of the Champagne region
where Saturday's stage ended.
</P>
<P>
The riders set off from beneath the Eiffel Tower to the nearby
bank of the River Seine. Pleasure boats crammed with onlookers
watched Armstrong _ easily identified in his leader's yellow
jersey_ and the rest glide down Avenues New York and President
Kennedy across town towards the Louvre Museum.
</P>
<P>
At one point during the race, Armstrong raised a glass of
champagne that someone had handed him, but he didn't take a sip.
</P>
<P>
Before the race, Armstrong was already looking ahead to
September's Olympics in Sydney, and speculating openly about his
prospects of clinching a first gold medal in the time trial
competition. He won all three time trials in last year's Tour and
as well as a time trial Friday, his first stage victory in this
year's Tour.
</P>
<P>
His only scheduled appearance Sunday after the race was to
attend a benefit for cancer research, a cause he's championed
since being diagnosed in 1996 with advanced testicular cancer.
Given less than a 40 percent chance of survival, he underwent
brain surgery and chemotherapy and had a testicle removed.
</P>
<P>
He resumed professional competition in 1998 but skipped that
year's Tour, which nearly fell apart over revelations that many
top cyclists were using banned performance-enhancing drugs.

PARIS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- France swept to a 5-0 win over
Austria in their Davis Cup World Group qualifying round match as
Sebastien Grosjean rallied to score a three-set victory over
Juergen Melzer on Sunday, accorting to reports.
</P>
<P>

beat Stefan Koubek 6-4 6-4 in the first of the reverse singles
before Grosjean beat Melzer 3-6 6-3 7-5.

3-4, 30-40 in the second set. He promptly saved the break point
with an ace and reeled off three straight games for the win.
</P>
<P>
Melzer played impressively against Grosjean in the second of

</P>
<P>
The left-hander mixed solid groundstrokes with an assured
touch at the net but Grosjean kept his nerve after falling 2-5
down in the final set and roared back to win as he took five games
in a row.
</P>
<P>
The French scored their seventh straight win over Austria in

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Oman Call for Progress at Camp David Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Oman on Monday expressed
the hope that the Camp David summit between the United States,
Israel and the Palestinians would achieve a progress to pave the
way for a comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah Khatib and his Omani
counterpart Yorsuf Bin Alawi discussed the latest developments of
the marathon trilateral summit at Camp David near Washington,
Jordan's official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
Both ministers expressed hope that the summit would result in an
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians to guarantee the
rights of all peoples in the region and to pave the way for a just,
durable and comprehensive peace, Petra said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Khatib also reiterated Jordan's persistent
support for the rights of the Palestinians, including their rights
to establish an independent state upon their own soil.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom believed that a solution to the Palestinian issue is
the corner stone of the current Arab-Israeli peace process in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Alawi arrived in Amman earlier in the day for a one-day official
visit.
</P>
<P>
The Camp David summit, opened on July 11 between U.S. President
Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, is aimed to solve the thorny final-status
issues including the fate of Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees,
settlements, border, water and security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The summit is being closely watched by Jordan and other Arab
countries, particularly for the status of Jerusalem and the issue
of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are some 4.5 million Palestinian refugees in
Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and other Arab countries after they fled
their homelands in successive Middle East wars. Jordan alone has
taken in 1.5 million Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government supports their rights to choose between
returning to their homeland or staying in Jordan while asking for
compensations from parties concerned.

TEHRAN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Oil ministers of Iran and Kuwait in
a meeting here on Monday stressed the need for both countries to
promote cooperation in the field of oil and energy at regional and
international levels.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Kuwait, because of their many common bonds and good
neighborly relations, could boost to an ideal level their

Iran-Kuwait bilateral ties, the Islamic Republic News Agency

promote their ties in the context of oil, gas and petrochemical
industries.
</P>

Future developments in the oil market and strengthening the
cooperation among OPEC member states were among the topics
discussed by the two sides, the report said, without giving further
details.

a carpenter who killed his would-be mother-in-law, stole her
jewelry and buried her in cement.

handing over of the aircraft is a symbol of the growth and
enhancement of China-Kenyan state to state and military to
military relations.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that China and Kenya started their military
exchanges with a Chinese military delegation visiting Kenya in
December 1996, saying the reciprocal visits to China by senior
Kenyan military officers had contributed much to the closer
military ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Tonje praised the Chinese side for sponsoring a
master degree for Kenyan officers and granting an assorted number
of vehicles expected to arrived in August this year for the Kenya
air force.
</P>
<P>
He said the first group of six Y-12 aircraft to the Kenya air
force arrived in April 1997 and since then has logged over 5,000
hours without any teething problems that normally accompany the
introduction of such a new system.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that China "will continue to assist us and that the
friendship and cordial relationship existing between our two
peoples and two countries will continue to grow from strength to
strength."
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Air Force Commander Nick Leshan presided over the
ceremony, which was also attended by Kenya's Deputy Chief of
General Staff Daniel Opande, among several hundred senior
officers and soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Jubilee 2000 SA Outraged at G7 Debt Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Jubilee 2000 South Africa,
an organization fighting for cancellation of third world and
apartheid debt, Monday expressed its outrage at the Group of Seven
(G7) debt announcement at their summit in Okinawa, Japan last week.
</P>
<P>
"The G7 have attempted to rehash old pledges that have failed,
effectively imposing further conditions on the promises of limited
debt cancellation that have yet to be delivered a year after they
were made in Cologne," the organization said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, 19,000 children die each day in sub-
Saharan Africa due to preventable diseases and the region is
spending four times more on servicing debt than on health and
education combined.
</P>
<P>
"We have every reason to believe that these are yet more empty
promises. We are astonished that the G7 have ignored global public
opinion by reversing debt cancellation processes. They are
effectively sentencing 19,000 African children a day to death by
debt," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement also criticized the G7 countries for failing to
adopt plans to cancel debt for countries that are affected by
military conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"(This) is hypocritical because arms exported predominantly
from G7 countries are used in the conflicts they refer to," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"No attention has been given to cancellation of odious debts,
debts of post-conflict countries, and countries affected by severe
natural disasters -- all of which are relevant to Southern Africa,
" it said.
</P>
<P>
The G7 leaders had admitted the need to speed up debt relief
for the world's poorest countries, but blamed military conflicts
in some nations for blocking progress.
</P>
<P>
So far only nine countries have qualified for cancellation of
their debt on the strength of a year-old promise to write off 100
billion U.S. dollars owed by the poorest 41 nations, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the G7 summit cost 750 million
dollars, the amount enough to cancel the debt payments of Rwanda,
Zambia, Cambodia, Nicaragua, Benin, Haiti, Guyana and Laos for one
year.
</P>
<P>
"As the G7 assess their own economies as moving 'towards more
balanced and sustainable patterns of growth', they have yet again
failed to act to reverse the growing impoverishment in developing
countries and global inequality," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The G7 countries are the United States, Britain, Canada,
France, Germany, Italy and Japan.

<HEADLINE> France Releases Russian Yacht </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS,July 24(Xinhua)-- France Monday released the Russian
yacht "Sedov" which was seized on July 13 in the western French
port of Brest at the request of a Swiss company which accuses the
Russian state of owing it 450 million French francs (66 million U.
S. dollars) of debt.
</P>
<P>
The Court of Great Investigation of Brest decided to lift the
seizure on "Sedov," which is an 80-year-old, 117-meter and four-
mast white yacht from the Murmansk Military Technology University
in northern Russia.
</P>
<P>
The president of the tribunal,Bertrand Louvel,ordered an "
immediate,entire and definite" lifting of the seizure of the
yacht.
</P>
<P>
The yacht left the quay of Brest at 20:00 local time (1800 GMT)
with all its 176-man crew and staff, including 100 cadets and 20
teenagers, according to Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss import-export company, Noga, says that Russian state
has broken a contract under which it is allowed to seize Russian
state properties everywhere to win back the debt owed by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The Russian state failed to pay for the food it sent to Russia
in 1992, said Noga, which has won a case against Russia in both an
arbitrary court in Sweden and a court in Paris.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the French judicial authorities froze some banking
accounts of the Russian diplomatic representations in France and a
French bailiff seized "Sedov" when it arrived in Brest to attend
an international sea festival.
</P>
<P>
In Monday's verdict, the court in Brest said that although the
yacht is run by the Murmansk Military Technology University, it is
not a patrimony of the university.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the university is also autonomous, both judicially
and morally, of the Russian state, said the court verdict.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "Sedov" cannot be seized under the Russian civil
code, said the verdict.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the court condemned Noga to pay 500,000 francs (7,
350 dollars) in damages and interests to the Murmansk Military
Technology University and 250,000 francs (3,675 dollars) in
damages and interests to the organizers of the Brest sea festival.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Still Sees Potential for Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- After overnight talks with
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, U.S. President Bill Clinton
still believed that there was a potential to reach a peace deal at
the Camp David summit, the White House said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a media center near Camp David, spokesman Joe
Lockhart said that Clinton, just hours after his return Sunday
from a summit of industrialized nations in Japan, worked overnight
until 5 a.m. Monday at the presidential retreat in northern
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
He first met separately with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and then held "intensive and
substantive" discussions with negotiators from both sides.
</P>
<P>
After a brief rest, Clinton renewed his discussions with
negotiators at his cabin beginning 10 a.m. Monday, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
"I think the fact that he was up till five a.m. working through
the issues in a very personal, hands-on way, and that he was back
at it again early this morning, should lead you to believe that he
thinks staying here for the time being is worthwhile," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said that Clinton was working on "a rolling assessment
" of whether the substance and atmosphere at these talks are one
that potentially could lead to an agreement.
</P>
<P>
"While that is the case, and while the president believes that
the discussions are substantive and have the potential of leading
to an agreement, he will remain here and he will keep the parties
here to keep working," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Should he come to the conclusions that the substance of the
discussions and the atmosphere of the discussions do not have the
potential to lead to an agreement, then he will act accordingly
and bring these discussions to an end," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart confirmed that George Tenet, director of the U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), had taken part in the Camp
David talks to discuss possible security arrangements between
Israelis and Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> DRC President Turns Down First U.N. Troop Contingent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Laurent Kabila, the
president of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), has turned
down armed U.N. troops deployed in regions his forces control,
including the capital Kinshasa, the United Nations said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the deployment of the first unit of armed troops
from Tunisia, which were to have been sent to Kinshasa to set up a
headquarters later this week, was called off, U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Kabila announced over the weekend that the U.N. mission in the
DRC could not dispatch armed troops to Kinshasa or Mbandaka in the
west.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard told a press conference here that "The deployment of
the Tunisian unit cannot take place unless the government provides
the necessary guarantees of cooperation required of it."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on February 24 authorized an
increase of the U.N. force to 500 military observers and some 5,
000 troops to protect them and provide logistics.
</P>
<P>
The deployment is conditional on the fighting subsiding, as
called for in peace accord signed in Lusaka, capital of Zambia,
last summer, which also included requests for a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
The force was to set up operations at four bases -- at Kindu
and Kisangani in rebel-held territory and Mbuji-Mayi and Mbandaka
in government-controlled regions. The Tunisian group was to set up
a headquarters in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission comprises some 228 military observers and
military liaison officers in and around the DRC, including 200 in
the central African country itself.
</P>
<P>
In DRC's many-sided war, Rwanda and Uganda are backing rival
rebel groups fighting against the Kabila government, supported by
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meeting on Western Sahara Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
has not scheduled any meeting on Monday morning, and an open
meeting which has been planned for Monday to consider a draft
resolution on the extensions of the U.N. Mission in Western Sahara
(MINURSO) was postponed, a U.N. spokesman said here.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Fred Eckhard, told a press conference here, "
Work is continuing on the language of a draft resolution
concerning the peacekeeping mission, which is set to end its
present mandate next Monday, July 31."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in his report that
recent U.N.-sponsored talks on the disputed territory of Western
Sahara not only failed to make progress but actually "moved things
backwards."
</P>
<P>
He was giving details of a meeting convened in London on June
28 by his personal envoy, former U.S. Secretary of State James
Baker, with representatives of Morocco, which seeks to incorporate
Western Sahara, and of the Polisario Front, which seeks its
independence.
</P>
<P>
Two northern African neighboring countries, Algeria and
Mauritania, also attended the meeting as observers.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. settlement plan to decide the future of the former
colony from which Spain withdrew in 1976 called for a referendum
in January 1992. But it has been repeatedly postponed, mainly due
to differences over who should be eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the efforts by my personal envoy, there was no
progress ... in resolving any of the multiple problems impeding
the implementation of the settlement plan," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan recommended another three-month renewal, until
October 31, of the U.N. Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara, or MINURSO, comprising 230 military personnel and 46
civilian police. It has been trying to organize the vote while
monitoring a cease-fire between Morocco and the Polisario Front
since September 1991.

<P>
NICOSIA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The parliaments of Cyprus and
Bulgaria wish to enhance their relations and cooperation, Cyprus
House of Representatives President Spyros Kyprianou said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou made the remark after his meeting with a delegation of
the Bulgarian National Assembly headed by its Vice-chairman Vasil
Gotzev, which arrived here Sunday on a four-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou told reporters that he briefed the Bulgarian
delegation on the Cyprus issue and that he discussed with the
Bulgarian parliamentarians the relations between the two countries,
which are "at a very good level."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the conviction that this kind of visits "are
particularly useful" because they not only promote the so-called
parliamentary diplomacy but also prepare the ground for wider
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou expressed the belief that the visit by the Bulgarian
delegation will further contribute to the enhancement of relations
between the two parliaments and the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Gotzev referred to the two countries' common bid to join the
European Union (EU), noting that "membership does not only means
rights but also obligations."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Cyprus, located strategically in a "very
interesting" place, has managed to keep safe from organized crime
and other negative phenomena existing in Europe and is also
economically advanced.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU membership in 1990 and started substantive
accession negotiations with the EU in November 1998. In December
1999 the EU agreed to start accession talks with Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cyprus News Agency, the Bulgarian parliament
delegation Monday had also meetings with Cyprus' acting Foreign
Minister, Finance Minister Takis Clerides, Justice and Public Order
Minister Nicos Koshis and the House Standing Committee on Foreign
and European Affairs.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes G-8 Reference to Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government on Monday
expressed satisfaction with a G-8 (seven most industrialized
nations plus Russia) reference to the Cyprus issue, the Cyprus News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued in Geneva, the Cyprus government
spokesman Michalis Papapetrou described the G-8 reference as "
positive".
</P>
<P>
The G-8, in a statement on regional issues issued during its
latest annual meeting in Japan, calls upon Cyprus' two sides to
intensify the negotiations "in an efforts to strike the compromises
needed to reach a just and lasting settlement that protects the
fundamental interests of both parties in an undivided Cyprus giving
full consideration to relevant Security Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
The G-8 also recalled the declaration issued at its last meeting

in Cologne calling for resumption of comprehensive negotiations
under the U.N. auspices on a Cyprus solution and commended the U.N.

Secretary-General for convening proximity talks between the two
parties "to prepare the ground for meaningful negotiations leading
to a comprehensive settlement."
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government welcomed the G-8 reference to the cyprus
issue, something which in itself places the Cyprus question as one
of the top problems the international community, Papapetrou said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "the positive reference" is a result of a
coordinated diplomatic efforts by the foreign ministers of Cyprus
and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriot north and the
Greek Cypriot south since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in the wake of an short-lived coup in
Nicosia seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of proximity talks have been held since December
1999. The first phase of the third round of talks started on July 5
in Geneva and adjourned on July 12.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary-General's Special Adviser on Cyprus, Alvaro
de Soto, Monday opened the second phase of the third round of talks
with separate hour-long meetings with Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
No statements were made after the meetings.

contracts Iraq signed with foreign countries to import food,
medicine and oil spare parts within the framework of the U.N. oil-
for-food program.
</P>
<P>
During the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh phases of the U.N.
humanitarian program, Iraq signed oil contracts worth 1.4 billion
U.S. dollars with foreign countries, but only 300 million dollars
worth of contracts were approved by the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
The minister held the U.S. and Britain responsible for
obstructing the approval of these contracts.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has claimed a total of 1,989 contracts Iraq signed with
foreign countries during the past seven phases of the U.N. oil-for-
food deal were put on hold, and among them nearly half were oil
contracts.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has frequently accused the U.S. and Britain of blocking
vital imports to impede the implementation of the U.N. oil-for-food
program.
</P>
<P>
Since the program was launched in December 1996, the U.S. and
Britain have shelved contracts worth over three billion dollars for
Iraq to buy humanitarian necessities.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions ever since its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, but the U.N. oil-for-food accord allows Baghdad to
export crude in return for U.N.-supervised imports of food,
medicine and humanitarian goods.

<HEADLINE> Larsen Says Israel Ends Most Border Encroachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. envoy Terje Roed Larsen said on
Monday Israel has ended most border encroachments and the last one
will be solved by the end of Monday.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held after his talks with President Emile
Lahoud and Prime Minister Salim Hoss, Larsen said he and Lahoud
reached an agreement that Israel has ended most of the nine border
encroachments of the Blue Line, which was drawn by the U.N. as
Israel's withdrawal line from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Larsen said it will be the time to discuss the issue of
deploying United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Larsen also revealed that the leader of UNIFIL have briefed the
development of the process to Secretary General Kofi Annan, who
will release a statement to the Security Council about Israel's
ending of border encroachments.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. will begin to discuss deployment of UNIFIL and
Lebanese army in the south since it has authenticated Israel's
entire withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We will talk about that issue in tomorrow's meeting," Larsen
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lebanon suggest the U.N. make an exploration on the
ground in order to ascertain Israel's entire withdrawal. Lebanese
leaders also raised the issue of detainees in Israeli prisons. The
Jewish state has held about 20 Lebanese as a bargain chip to
exchange an Israeli pilot who is allegedly in the hands of the
Lebanese resistance.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The South African cabinet has
not yet deliberated or taken a decision on the country's possible
candidature for the United Nations Security Council, said foreign
affairs director general Sipho Pityana on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Our preoccupation is less with South Africa's candidature than
with the transformation of the U.N. Security Council to meet the
challenges of the new millennium and century," Pityana said at a
news conference in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
According to Pityana, South Africa has been urged to make
itself available for such a position and the country supports
Africa's demand for two permanent seats on the council.
</P>
<P>
What South Africa is interested in is how Africa could be best
represented and its interests advanced, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said "if South Africa was asked by the continent, it would
consider making itself available."

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Continues Power Rationing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Electric Power
Corporation (EEPCO), the sole power distributor in the Horn of
Africa country, will institute a new power rationing schedule to
introduce a total 16-hours blackout every fourth day, effective on
July 26, 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to Ethiopian Minister of Public Works and Urban
Development Haile Assegide, the latest power rationing measure
will replace an earlier one, under which there is a total blackout
for a similar duration every three days.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the new schedule, electric power will be
available for domestic purposes for 82 hours on stretch, which
will be followed by a 16 hour blackout every four days, Haile said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the new measure will also ensure an interrupted 65
hours supply for industrial purposes which will be followed by a
16 hours blackout, every four days.
</P>
<P>
Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, is also under control of
the new schedule.
</P>
<P>
Haile, who is also EEPCO's board chairman, said that the new
development, even though minor, has been made possible with the
increase in the volume of water in the dams of the Koka and Melka
Wakena hydro-power generation plants.
</P>
<P>
Koka and Melka Wakena hydro-power generation plants are the two
major electricity suppliers in Ethiopia which is fully dependent
on water energy to generate power.
</P>
<P>
The load-shedding, which has been in force since mid-June this
year, has helped effectively avert a major energy crisis in the
country, EEPCO officials said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Customs Income up by 6.8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian customs has
collected 2.77 billion birr (about 330 million U.S. dollars) for
the fiscal year up to June 2000, representing a 6.8 percent
increase over that of the corresponding period of last year,
according to local Walta Information Center on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Getahun Wondimu, senior official with the Federal Custom
Authority, was quoted as saying that a large chunk of the income,
about 83.9 percent, was made from various types of tax levied on
goods that passed through the Addis Ababa Lagahar Customs.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that this year's income was less by 15 percent
from the targeted 3.24 billion birr (400 million dollars), mainly
due to decline in the volume of imported goods.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian customs secured about 2.5 billion birr (about 300
million dollars) in the 1998/99 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The custom authority is now implementing a computerization
program with the view to improving its capacity.

LUANDA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Defense and security ministers from
the member countries of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) have recommended the establishment of a monitoring
mechanism on the international sanctions against the Angolan
rebels, the official news agency Angop reported here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Defense Minister Kundi Paihama was quoted as saying at
the 21st meeting of the SADC defense and security ministers held
in Maputo, Mozambique during July 19-23 that an ad hoc committee
will be set up to monitor the sanctions imposed by the United
Nations against the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is one of the most peaceful of its kind, Paihama
said, and the recommendation on the reinforcement of the sanctions
on the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
was also discussed.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Mozambique took over the rotating presidency of
the inter-state committee of defense and security in the SADC from
Swaziland. The committee is a SADC organ in charge of cooperation
among the member countries on matters of defense and security.

<HEADLINE> More Zimbabwean Companies Close Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-three big companies have
been liquidated in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, alone in the six
months up to June this year because of the country's macro-
economic problems, a national debt collector said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dun and Bradsteet Managing Director Aleixo Fernando told the
Zimbabwe News Agency that the closures were due to economic
problems rather than political reasons as has been assumed in some
political circles.
</P>
<P>
Some businesses closed down because the prevailing economic
situation left them no choice while other businesses folded up due
to bad management, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries said
Zimbabwe's private sector has lost at least 50,000 jobs since the
beginning of the year due to the economic crisis gripping the
country, and the number of retrenches is likely to reach 100,000
by the end of the year if the economic problems are not resolved.
</P>
<P>
The economic problems include a managed exchange rate, foreign
currency and fuel shortages, an unstable business environment
characterized by a staggering domestic and foreign debt, high
inflation and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"Companies in the agriculture, shipping, fertilizer and other
sectors have been hit hard because of the managed exchange rate,"
the confederation said.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, about 54,000 people who had been fully employed
have lost their jobs in the last six months," said president of
the confederation Joshua Nyoka.

<P>
LAGOS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles Taylor
Monday sworn in his new vice president, Moses Blah, at a colorful
ceremony in the country's capital Monrovia, the Pan-African News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Blah, 53, replaced Enoch Dogolea to become the 28th Vice
President of Liberia. Dogolea died late June in a clinic in
Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, where he was taken for medical diagnosis
and treatment.
</P>
<P>
The new vice president was unanimously selected by the ruling
National Patriotic Party and subsequently endorsed by the National
Legislature (parliament) as required by the constitution of
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his selection, Blah served as Liberia's ambassador to
Libya, Tunisia and Algeria since 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a brief induction statement, Blah called for a moment of
silence in tribute to his predecessor, saying it is "a challenge
to work along with President Taylor in achieving the goals" of the
government.
</P>
<P>
Blah is little known among Liberians except for his role as a "
Special Forces" commando in Taylor's erstwhile National Patriotic
Front of Liberia, that ignited the Liberia civil war in 1989.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Expresses Regret for Angola to Miss Lome Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General Salim
Ahmed Salim of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) has
expressed his regret for the Angolan government to miss the recent
summit held in the Togolese capital Lome, Tanzania's official
Daily News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The summit would have been a good opportunity for the Angolan
government to express its concern over the alleged violation of
sanctions against the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), he was quoted as saying in an
interview here over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
He said many African leaders at the summit had wanted Angola to
attend the annual meeting for discussion about the country's
reservations.
</P>
<P>
"The Angolan government made very strong reservations and were
opposed to the idea of going to Lome, basing their argument on a
report which referred to some countries as having violated the
sanctions. But still Lome summit would have been a good
opportunity for serious discussion on the matter," Salim said.
</P>
<P>
Angola had boycotted the summit, accusing host president and
current OAU Chairman Gnassingbe Eyadema of helping rebels fighting
the Angolan government by trading in diamonds they have mined and
fueling its civil war.
</P>
<P>
According to Salim, these were very serious allegations that
ought to have been discussed seriously by African heads of state
and governments.
</P>
<P>
Although Angola did not go to Lome, the secretary-general said,
the question of Angola was discussed at length.
</P>
<P>
He said African leaders who attended the meeting came up very
clearly calling on every African state to implement sanctions
against UNITA and its leader Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
"We all imposed sanctions against UNITA. We all know what
Savimbi is doing now in Angola. He has been a source of
destruction and terror in that country and has violated every
agreement that have been reached before. Therefore the Angolan
government needed to be supported," he said.
</P>
<P>
A peace accord collapsed in December 1998 after the Angolan
government and UNITA resumed fighting a war that erupted after the
country's independence from Portugal in 1975. The U.N.
peacekeeping force that had been overseeing the accord pulled out
in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
A recent U.N. report said the overall situation in the war-torn
country remains "precarious", with 1 million people completely
reliant on food aid to survive and another 2.5 million receive
other types of humanitarian assistance.

<HEADLINE> S.Leonean Rebels Have to Pay Price if Attempting to Attack U.N. Force: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Any rebel who attempts to
attack the U.N. peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL)
should know that "there will be a price to pay," U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Annan, upon his arrival at the U.N. headquarters in New York
Monday morning, made the statement in response to a press question
after a UNAMSIL military offensive succeeded Sunday in clearing a
breakaway military faction from a strategic road leading to the
capital of Sierra Leone, Freetown.
</P>
<P>
"It was a preemptive strike against a group of rebels who were
planning an attempt to attack the (U.N.) force," Annan said. "So
the UNAMSIL commander decided that they should make a preemptive
strike to disperse that unit before they were attacked."
</P>
<P>
"Basically we are going to remain vigilant, we are going to
remain firm and anyone who attempts to attack the peacekeepers
would know that they will defend themselves and that there will be
a price to pay," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The operation, which began Saturday, involved heavily armed
United Nations ground troops and helicopter gunships, a United
Nations military officer said in Freetown, adding that an unknown
number of renegades were killed. One U.N. soldier was also
reported wounded.
</P>
<P>
The offensive was the latest move by the United Nations to
restore its authority in the West African country, where the U.N.
peacekeeping mission has been embarrassed by kidnappings and
military setbacks since May.
</P>
<P>
United Nations troops are patrolling the road, a U.N.
spokeswoman said in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
As the United Nations force tried to reassert authority, a
contingent of 230 troops from the Royal Irish Regiment of Britain
arrived here this weekend to train about 1,000 new Sierra Leonean
recruits.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean officials said the recruits would soon be
deployed to front-line positions to fight the rebels of the
Revolutionary United Front, who re-ignited an eight-year civil war
in May.

<P>
OTTAWA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Canada's major aircraft maker
Bombardier is looking to add at least 1,000 new jobs and an
aerospace facility in Quebec, the country's National Post
newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
With a record deal of 3.1 billion Canadian dollars (about 2.1
billion U.S. dollars) with the U.S.-based Delta Connection Inc. in
March, Bombardier needs the expansion to ensure that it will be in
a position to deliver 104 of its CRJ-series jets.
</P>
<P>
The delivery is expected to start in December and continue
through to the end of 2004, said the report, which quoted
Bombardier spokeswoman Catherine Chase as confirming the dramatic
increase over the coming years.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we have been expanding to help with all the increases in
production we need," said the spokeswoman Sunday while attending
the Farnborough Air Show in England.
</P>
<P>
Bombardier, which builds both 50- and 70-seat jets at its
Dorval headquarters plant in Montreal, has already added 3,000
jobs since 1998 as a result of increasing demand for regional jets.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday expressed the hope that U.N. troops can be soon
deployed along the Lebanon-Israel border.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Annan said that since Israel withdrew
its troops from southern Lebanon, U.N. troops had been patrolling
the vacated area but had not been actually deployed to the border.
</P>
<P>
"I hope to see that done in the next few days," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"What had held us up was we were hoping to clean up all the
violations on the blue line before we do that," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
 The blue line is the U.N.-identified line behind which Israel
was meant to withdraw after its 22 years' occupation of southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The violations have all now been cleared. I will be reporting
to the Security Council today with the latest developments on the
ground. I also expect to speak to President (Emile) Lahoud of
Lebanon," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said the U.N. and Lebanon were working on the
deployment.
</P>
<P>
"So I hope in the next few days you will see our troops on the
border," he added.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot "Parliament" Attacked by Victims of Banking Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- About 3,000 victims of a banking
scandal in northern Turkish Cypriot area of Cyprus Monday briefly
occupied the "parliament" and took the "prime minister" Dervis
Eroglu hostage, Greek Cypriot media reported.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators hurled eggs, plastic bottles and wooden
sticks at the "parliament" building, calling for the resignation of

the "government" and demanding compensation for their losses.
</P>
<P>
Many of them then forced their way into the building, where
the "parliament" was in session, and then took hostage some "
deputies"
and Eroglu.
</P>
<P>
Riot police intervened and drove the demonstrators out to the
courtyard of the building, arresting seven of them for disrupting
public order.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, a eastern Mediterranean island, has been divided into
the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied its northern third after a failed coup seeking
union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Nine years after the Turkish invasion, the Turkish Cypriots
declared a breakaway state which is only recognized by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators demanded that the Turkish Cypriot regime pay
them their monthly compensation, which has been failing to come for
the past few months, to cover losses incurred after six troubled
banks were put under "public administration" in the past six
months.
</P>

<HEADLINE> World Record-Holders Pull up With Injuries in 200m Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Two world record-holders pulled
up early in the much-hyped race with injuries in the men's 200-
meters race as the U.S. Olympic athletics trials concluded in
Sacramento, California Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene lost their dreams of double
gold in the sprints when Johnson left the track about 50 meters
into the race and Greene stopped just short of the straightaway.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the three spots for Sydney Olympics were taken by two
collegians and an old man. John Capel won in 19.85 seconds,
followed by 34-year-old Floyd Heard in 19.88 and Coby Miller in 19.
96.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, the 200m and 400m world record holder, will only
defend his 400 title in Sydney where Greene, the world record-
holder in the 100m, has his berth in the most-coveted title-racing
event.
</P>
<P>
"We should all learn a lesson from this," said Johnson who
entered with a sore left Achilles' and now has quadriceps and
hamstring problems. "(The media) built this up, me and Maurice. It
ended up pissing those other guys off and they ran real fast."
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad situation that me and Michael didn't finish the
race. It put a lot of attention on the sport," said Greene.
</P>
<P>
Against the tradegy of the men's 200m race, Marion Jones
materized her dream of competing in five events at the Olympics,
by winning the women's 200m in the year's best time of 21.94
seconds following her victories in the 100m and the long jump as
she was surely to be picked for the 4x100m and 4x200m relays.
</P>
<P>
"I'm just happy these eight days are over," Jones said of the
trials and the prospect of the record-setting goal in the Olympics,
"I really don't want it to sink in. I just want to run and jump,
and keep it going."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the trails only produced for the first time a family
that swept all three Olympic berths in a track event through three
Clark women.
</P>
<P>
Leading the way was Hazel Clark, 22, and running in her first
trials, with a winning time of one minute 58.97 seconds. In second
at 1:59.12 was Hazel's sister-in-law Jearl Miles-Clark, 33, and
placing third was Joetta Clark, 37, in 1:59.49, just 0.01 ahead of
Meredith Rainey-Valmon.
</P>
<P>
Stacy Dragila delivered another feat by beating her world
record with 4.63 meters in the women's pole vault, while Gail
Denvers who nearly quit track about 10 years ago due to Grave's
disease, shattered her national record in the 100m hurdles in a
year-best 12.97 seconds.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Kuwait to Talk About Disputed Gas Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar
Zanganeh Monday expressed hope that Iran and Kuwait will reach an
understanding on a disputed Gulf continental shelf that is rich in
gas and oil.
</P>
<P>
Iran is ready to define the continental shelf between the two
countries and the Kuwaiti side has also recently announced its
readiness in this regard, Zanganeh said while welcoming Kuwaiti Oil
Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah at the airport.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti minister arrived here Monday noon at the invitation
of his Iranian counterpart, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The continental shelf in northern Gulf, including the Dorra gas
field, is estimated to contain 3-5 percent of the world's known gas
reserves. But the area is claimed by three regional countries -
Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Iran started drilling operations in the offshore gas field in
May, which reportedly invited protests from Kuwait. Tehran
announced later that it had stopped the operations but stressed
that it was drilling in its territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia signed a final maritime border accord
involving the gas field on July 2, which is considered a crucial
step toward reaching a similar agreement with non-Arab Iran on the
disputed area.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has indicated that an understanding with Saudi Arabia is
essential for sea border demarcation with Iran.

<P>
SEOUL, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Japanese has become the second most
popular foreign language among South Korean high school students,
the Education Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Based on a recent survey conducted among high school students,
the ministry said some 60 percent wanted to learn Japanese as
their second foreign language except English.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 percent preferred to Chinese while 10 percent to German
and French respectively.
</P>
<P>
As of the first semester this year, 158 of 185 high schools in
Seoul teach Japanese, 16 more than that of 1997, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of schools offering French decreased nine
and German eight.
</P>
<P>
The popularity of Japanese seems to stem from the relative ease
of learning and similarity to Korean that can be conducive to
entering college, said a ministry spokesman.

<HEADLINE> American Triathlete Completes Swim across Lake Erie in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- American Triathlete Jim Dreyer
completed his swim across Lake Erie early Monday to the side of
Canada, according to the swimmer's Web site.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Michigan man emerged from swim of 42 kilometers
in Lake Erie just before 03:00 a.m. EDT (2000 GMT, Sunday), about
20 hours after he dived into the lake shortly before 07:00 a.m. (
0000 GMT) Sunday near Erie, Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
This was the first phase of a planned journey of more than 310
kilometers by the American marathon swimmer in his show of
fortitude.
</P>
<P>
Once on the side of Ontario, Canada, Dreyer is yet to run 42
kilometers and bicyle another 180 kilometres. After that, he will
swim 50 more kilometers across Lake Ontario to complete the
endurance test. He expects the journey to take him 50 to 60 hours.
</P>
<P>
Dreyer pared more than seven hours off the record for the
fastest swim across Lake Huron last September after he became the
first person to swim a direct crossing of Lake Michigan in August
1998.

<HEADLINE> Traditional Chinese Thinking Can Help Ethnic Groups' Coexistence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A famous Chinese anthropologist
said today that traditional Chinese culture and China's current
policies towards the ethnic minorities can enlighten the rest of
the world about peaceful coexistence among the world's ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
Fei Xiaotong, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, China's top law making body, was
speaking at the opening ceremony of the International Union of
Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences (IUAES) 2000 Inter-
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Fei, who is also a renowned ethnologist and sociologist,
pointed out that if the issue of peaceful coexistence cannot be
satisfactorily resolved among different ethnic groups, there will
be many problems, such as disputes and even wars.
</P>
<P>
He believed the mindset that wants peaceful coexistence while
acknowledging differences is the only option for the world's
colorful cultures, but the sort of mentality that rejects
diversification could only lead to extinction of the cultures.
</P>
<P>
With a schedule of discussions focusing on "Metropolitan Ethnic
Cultures: Maintenance and Interaction," the congress is the most
important international congress for anthropologists and
ethnologists ever held in China.
</P>
<P>
More than 360 delegates from 46 countries worldwide are
participating in the five-day congress, which covers a number of
academic areas including anthropological and ethnological sciences,
biology and genetics.

SEOUL, July 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korea informed the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Monday a name-list of its
five officials to the inter-Korean ministerial talks.
</P>
<P>
The five officials are Unification Minister Park Jae-kyu, Vice
Minister for Finance and Economy Uhm Rak-yong, Vice Minister for
Culture and Tourism Kim Soon-kyu, Assistant for Policy to the
Defense Minister Kim Chong-hwan, Director-General at the
Unification Ministry Suh Young-kyo.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that you will notify us of the government delegates
and accompanying reporters and support team members," said the
South Korean government in a letter to the DPRK via the liaison
office at the truce village of Pamunjom. "We will deliver our
guarantee of the delegates' safety through the liaison office
Wednesday."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Pyongyang agreed to Seoul's proposal of a 35-

<HEADLINE> U.S. Troops Apologize for Dumping Toxic Chemical into S.Korean River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I officially express to you my deepest apology for the
incident and the resulting stress and anxiety due to the disposal
of formaldehyde down a drain on Yongsan Garrison," said Lt.
General Daniel Peterosky, commander of the Eighth U.S. Army, in a
letter of apology.
</P>
<P>
This marks the first time that a U.S. commanding general has
offered an official apology to the South Koreans since U.S. forces
landed on the Korean peninsula 55 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Peterosky said the investigation will be fair and thorough and
the USFK is taking the incident very seriously.
</P>
<P>
"Realizing the extreme concern the Korean people have expressed,
we have an elevated responsibility for this investigation to the
commander of the 19th Theater Support Command, Maj. Gen. Barry
Bates," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bates is the commander responsible for all army installations
in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The three-star general pledged to take appropriate corrective
action based on the results of the investigation and take all
steps necessary to preclude similar events in the future.
</P>
<P>
On July 14, the Green Korea United (GKU) disclosed at a press
conference that the USFK dumped 480 bottles of formaldehyde, each
containing 475 milliliters of the chemical, through the Yongsan
camp's drain on February 9 this year. GKU showed evidence photos
and bottles with remaining solution of formaldehyde.
</P>
<P>
One day later, the USFK admitted that it dumped the toxic
chemical into the Han River only once and that the dumped amount
was only 20 gallons or 75.7 liters, one-third of that claimed by
GKU.
</P>
<P>
Formaldehyde, also known as formalin, is a toxic chemical
highly hazardous to the human body, causing leukemia and other
fatal diseases.
</P>
<P>
The USFK used formaldehyde to preserve the bodies of U.S.
servicemen who died in South Korea before airlifting them home.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. dumping of the toxic chemical was disclosed,
South Korean civic and environmental groups have been staging
rallies, demanding punishment of those responsible for the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Amid the escalation of anti-American sentiment, GKU lodged a
suit with the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office, demanding that
USFK Commander-in-Chief Gen. Thomas Schwartz be punished for the
release of toxic chemicals into the Han River, a major source of
drinking water for Seoul's citizens.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The hotels in the Riviera of France
registered a record of 82 percent occupancy in June, one month
ahead of the full vacation season, reported the monthly "Barometer
of Tourism" on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The occupancy is 12 percentage points higher than the same
season last year.
</P>
<P>
Hotel occupancy in the Riviera usually reaches as high as 80
percent in July and August.
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons for the exceptionally high occupancy is the
postponement of the Grand Price Formula One car racing in Monaco
from May to June and the holding of the World Gas Congress in Nice
from June 6 to 9 which attracted 15,000 attendants.
</P>
<P>
Hotel occupancy from mid-July to mid-August in the Riviera,

<P>
All courts should play their judicial roles and crack down on
crimes to create a sound secure environment, he said.

and selfless.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, some 150 local and military

Sichuan Province, a senior heritage official said any construction
which endangers cultural relics must be banned.
</P>
<P>
Real estate developers must obtain approval from the State
Administration of Cultural Heritage (SACH) within a designated 12-
square-kilometer area near Sanxingdui, an important relics site in
Guanghan County, SACH Deputy Director Zhang Bai said.

city blocks, constituting 37 percent of the total area of the
former Beijing city.

<P>
The old streets and residence communities maintain the unique
features of Beijing, capital of several ancient dynasties. The
latest move initiated by the local government shows Beijing's
determination to preserve its treasured heritage, including
ancient buildings.

kilns of the Qing Dynasty and the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).

News of the auction, which will be organized by Shanghai New
Century Auction Company on September 10, has caught the attention

observe the stars so as to give instructions for farming
activities," said Shang Qixing, a local historian.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, the observatory was built more
than 4,000 years ago. "It is one of the earliest relics of human
civilization in the world, and it has survived numerous natural
and social disasters," Shang said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Vows to Foil Jerusalem Concessions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JEURSALEM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- All Israeli parties in the
opposition, except the religious United Torah Judaism, have
expressed support for an early election bill and pledged to thwart
any attempt by Prime Minister Ehud Barak to make concessions on
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Heads of the opposition factions in the Knesset (Parliament) met
on Monday at the invitation of Likud leader Ariel Sharon and issued
a statement to that effect.
</P>
<P>
Sharon later told Israel Radio that they had agreed on ways to
foil the division of Jerusalem and bring down the government. "We
shall do everything in our power to cause the collapse of this
government and set up a national unity government in its place," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Barak is negotiating with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at
Camp David in the United States on the toughest issues including
Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements, borders and
water sources.
</P>
<P>
He has indicated the willingness to consider forming a national
unity government in case the ongoing Camp David summit ends in
failure.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with chair of the immigrants' party
Yisrael Ba'aliya, Natan Sharansky, on Saturday night, Barak said
that if the Camp David talks collapse, "a national emergency
government is definitely an option to be taken into account."
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Likud and National Union-Yisrael
Beiteinu parties withdrew their no-confidence motions scheduled for
Monday against Barak over the Camp David negotiations.
</P>
<P>
They said they did so because of the prime minister's absence.
</P>
<P>
However, Knesset Member Michael Kleiner's one-man Herut faction
has decided to press ahead its no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Klener's no-confidence motion was boycotted by almost
all the other factions after he insisted on submitting it in
defiance of standard Knesset practice.
</P>
<P>
The motion won a majority of 4-2, with two absentions. Likud
leaders criticized the move, calling it unseemingly to carry out a
parliamentary move of such importance while the prime minister was
on a mission on the nation's behalf.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Christian church leaders in Jerusalem have
planned to meet Palestinian Minister for Jerusalem Affairs Faisal
Husseini to discuss the status of Jerusalem and the implications of
the Camp David negotiations on them.
</P>
<P>
The church heads have also requested meetings with Israeli
officials.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- A new power communication line between Turkey and
Bulgaria will be installed.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Shilyashki, chairman of the Bulgarian State Energy and
Energy Sources Agency, said in a statement that the 260-kilometer-
long power communication line linking Turkey and Bulgaria would be
installed at a cost of about 31 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that a 200-kilometer-long portion of the line would be
erected within Turkish territory, and each country would be
responsible for the financing of its own portion.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Dubai Ports and Customs Department (DPCD)
announced Sunday that a new Textile City will set up in the Emirate
of Dubai.
</P>
<P>
The Dubai Textile City project is the first of its kind in the
Middle East and the second in the world, said Hamad Mohammed Fadel
Al Mazroue, charge d'affaires of the Director General of the DPCD.
</P>
<P>
The city is also part of a series of investment projects
launched by the DPCD in line with its strategic plan, aimed at
improving Dubai's economic and financial atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The official added that designs of the proposed city project,
which will be executed in phases, had been completed and were
awaiting final approval.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- While Turkey's population has increased by 29.8
percent over the past 15 years, the number of taxpayers has
remained almost unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Finance Ministry and the State Statistics
Institute have revealed how extensively the "unregistered economy"
had existed in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures, Turkey's population was registered at
50.306 million, with 1.967 million taxpayers, 15 years ago. But in
2000 when the population reached 65 million, the number of
taxpayers only totaled 1.988 million.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The Bank of Cyprus (BOC) has received approval from
the Athens Stock Exchange (ASE) for listing, local media reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The BOC will be the first Cyprus bank to be listed on the Athens
Stock Exchange and also the first foreign company to do so.
</P>
<P>
The listing is expected to be achieved in September or October.
A fixed date will be formally announced once it is agreed with the
Greek authorities.
</P>
<P>
"The listing of Bank of Cyprus share on the Athens Stock
Exchange will create new prospects for the BOC group since new
sources of capital will be tapped, enabling the group to implement
its program of rapid expansion," BOC group chairman Solon
Triantafillides said.
</P>
<P>
The BOC group will be issuing 39 million shares, equivalent to
12 percent of share capital.

<HEADLINE> Israel Witnesses Increasing Trade with Arab States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JEURSALEM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Israel's exports to Arab
countries grew by more than 33 percent in the first half of the
year to 62 million U.S. dollars, the Israeli Manufacturers
Association said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The association counted exports to Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt,
Morocco, Tunis, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, imports from Arab countries rose by
about 28 percent, worth 26 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
There is still a huge potential for trade growth between Israel
and its Arab neighbors if a peace deal is clinched, the association
said.
</P>
<P>
A study by the Tel Aviv University said earlier that Israel
stands to gain another 9.3 billion U.S. dollars as "peace
dividends" from its Arab neighbors by taking advantage of the
countries' geographic proximity.
</P>
<P>
The estimate was based on the assumption that all economic and
political trade barriers are removed between Israel and Jordan,
Syria and Egypt. Trade barriers in question include lack of formal
relations, tariffs, quotas and anything else which prohibits the
free flow of goods between borders.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan are the only two Arab countries that have
established diplomatic ties with Israel. The Jewish state is now
trying to hammer out a peace accord with its half-century rival,
the Palestinians at the presidential retreat of Camp David in
Maryland, the Untied States.
</P>
<P>
Israel's peace negotiations with Syrian, which broke off in
January, is also expected to resume in a few months' time.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Israel is having a record-breaking boom
in tourism.
</P>
<P>
A record 4.5 million tourists visited Israel in the first half
of this year, representing a 31-percent growth over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
The number of hotel bookings grew by 37 percent over the same
half of the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Pledges Peace, Development in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
vowed Monday to fulfill his administration's commitment to carry
out peace and development in the country's war-torn southern
island of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Estrada made the remarks in his third State of the Nation
Address(SONA) delivered Monday afternoon at the joint session of
Congress in Quezon city, Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
"Because without peace, there can be no development," the
president said. He also said that without development, there can
be no peace.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the president said, the government has adopted
four-point strategy in approaching the Mindanao question.
</P>
<P>
The four-point strategy, he explained, is to restore and
maintain peace in Mindanao; to develop Mindanao; to continue to
seek peace talks with the Muslim rebel groups; and to continue
with the implementation of the peace agreement between the
government and the Moro National Liberation Front (MINF)
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure permanent peace in the future, Estrada said,
"we had to demolish the rebels' apparatus for making war."
</P>
<P>
In the past years, he noted, the rebels simply used the peace
talks as "an opportunity for arms buildup" and for "enlarging
their threat to the republic."
</P>
<P>
According to Estrada, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
took advantage of the 1997 ceasefire to commit at least 227
violations,including the kidnapping and bombing incidents.
</P>
<P>
By making these terrorist incidents, he said, they inflicted
severe damage on the country's image abroad, and scared much-
needed investments away.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the MNLF, has claimed to fight
for a separate Islamic state in Mindanao, but the government
troops has frustrated the biggest rebel group in the battle field
in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The government troops also took the overrun, at the beginning
of this month, of the MILF's main stronghold Abubakar in
Maguindanao province as a significant military victory.
</P>
<P>
"I now invite the MILF into a brotherly embrace of peace,"
Estrada said. But he insists that they "must accept our conditions
", and must drop secession, drop their criminal activities, and
drop their arms.
</P>
<P>
"These are not requests but demands. They are not proposals but
premises. We can talk about when, where and how, but not about
whether or not," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Our people will simply not stand for the dismemberment of the
country. All of the Philippines belongs to all Filipinos," he said,
adding that the constitution principle is the Philippines is "one
state, one republic with one government."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president also voiced importance of
rehabilitation of the war-torn island.
</P>
<P>
"Fighting the rebellion is one thing," he said. "Fighting the
root of rebellion is another. It will take the whole society to do
it."
</P>
<P>
In order to convert Mindanao into the main food basket of the
country, Estrada said, the government has been providing full
development support to the whole island.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has poured in more than 32 billion pesos
(eight billion U.S. dollars) in the past four years for socio-
economic development programs into the Autonomous region of Muslim
Mindanao(ARMM), which comprises 14 provinces.
</P>
<P>
To move both the peace process and development of Mindanao
forward faster, he urged congress to pass the bill granting
special power for his administration to fast-track development of
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the matter of extremist group of Abu Sayyaf,
Estrada said: "We are all happy that some hostages have been
released."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the determination that the government will "
do everything to reasonable to obtain the release of the remaining
hostages as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf group has so far freed six Malaysians and one
German woman out of the 21 hostages they abducted from a Malaysian
resort in April.
</P>
<P>
The president also sent a clear message to all Muslim Filipinos
of the country, saying that the fight is not against Muslims at
all but against rebels and other outlaws.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada delivered his first SONA on July 27, 1998 and
his second SONA on July 26 1999. Different from the third SONA,
the previous two were mainly focused on economic recovery out of
the then sweeping Asian financial turmoils.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Urges Comprehensive Anti-Corruption Approach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Monday his country needs a comprehensive approach to
combating corruption and warned government officials to brace
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"We can no longer fight corruption piecemeal. We need a
comprehensive approach that would reduce opportunities for
corruption," Estrada said in his State of the Nation Address
delivered before the third joint session of the 11th Congress.
</P>
<P>
He said the approach would, among other things, remove needless
regulations and simplify procedures, increase public vigilance to
deter and detect commissions of graft, target selected departments
and agencies for cleansing, stiffen sanctions against corruption.
</P>
<P>
The president described graft and corruption as the "worst form
of rottenness" in the country, which, aside from eroding the moral
fabric of the nation, also robs the poor of resources, increases
the costs of doing business, erodes tax collection efforts, and
drives away investments.
</P>
<P>
"I warn all departments and agencies of government to brace
themselves, especially those consistently listed in surveys and
studies on government corruption," he said.
</P>
<P>
"My next war will be against corrupt government personnel and
people from the private sector who connive with them," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a World Bank study, at least 20 percent of
government project funds ends up as kickbacks in the pockets of
corrupt officials, the President said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, upon President Estrada's request, had conducted
an extensive analysis on combating corruption in the Philippines
and recommended measures to put in place a comprehensive program
to fight this menace.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he will soon submit to the Congress an urgent bill
for the creation of an anti-graft and corruption commission, which
will have the necessary powers and resources to combat "this long-
festering cancer in our society."
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Congress to speed up passage of the long-
pending anti-racketeering bill with provisions against money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Estrada announced several measures that would expand
transparency in government contracts and thus eliminate graft and
corruption in public transactions.
</P>
<P>
He said these measures, including steps that will rule out
negotiated contracts in all government procurements, public works
and other infrastructure projects, will assure the public of "
crystal clear" transparency in all government transactions and
remove all opportunities for abuse by government officials.
</P>
<P>
To promote transparency, he said his administration will pave
the way for the adoption of the electronic public bidding system,
or the so-called "reverse auction" method, where bids from all
suppliers and contractors will be posted on a website, for
worldwide scrutiny.

<HEADLINE> Wahid Meets Chinese Vice-President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hu Jintao conveyed to his host Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and Premier Zhu Rongji's warm greetings.
</P>
<P>
He said China and Indonesia were two close neighbors with a
tradition of friendship dating back long into the history. Ever
since President Wahid's state visit to China last year, the two
countries started to reap breakthrough developments in all areas
of cooperation and the bilateral relations hence entered into a
brand-new chapter of historical era.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said that agreements reached by the two
heads of state are undergoing the implementation process. This
year marked the 50th anniversary of the formal establishment of
diplomatic relations between China and Indonesia. With the
personal attention of the two heads of state, the Sino-Indonesian
relationship exhibited an unprecedentedly rosy prospect.
</P>
<P>
He conveyed his gratitude to the Indonesian government for the
longtime precious support given to China in the United Nations
Human Rights Commission and the "One China" policy Indonesian
government had been following to support China's reunification
course.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the two sides could continue maintaining close
cooperation and mutual support in safeguarding national
sovereignty, territorial integrity and in keeping off the external
intervention.
</P>
<P>
Hu also expressed his appreciation for the ethnic
reconciliation policy pursued by President Wahid and his
government. He said that ethnic Chinese were one of the members of
the Indonesian ethnic family and he hoped that all ethnic groups
of Indonesia could lead a harmonious coexistence and contribute to
the economic and social development of the country.
</P>
<P>
President Wahid extended his heartfelt welcome to Hu Jintao and
his entourage, and asked Hu to convey his warm greetings and best
wishes to President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
He said his government and himself would always stick to a
friendly policy towards China. The Indonesian people, especially
the business circle, were most willing to enhance all forms of
mutually beneficial cooperation with China. The amicable feeling
among the peoples of the two nations would be deepened and renewed
through such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Wahid also contended that Indonesia believed there was only one
China in the world and Indonesia supported Chinese government's
position on Taiwan and Tibet.

<P>
For example, 26.7 hectares of high-yield farmland were allotted
to 220 farmers who lost farmland in Qianxi County, in southwest
China's Guizhou Province, together with a number of small water-
control projects.
</P>
<P>
The western region of the upper parts of the Yangtze and the
Yellow River serves as a protective screen for the ecological
environment in China. Soil erosion in the region has become the
most serious issue in the country's environmental protection
endeavor.
</P>
<P>
An important move launched by the Chinese government has been
to check the increasingly threatened ecological environment in the
west and to achieve sustainable development in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Peiyan, minister in charge of the State Development
Planning Commission, noted that enhancing ecological work and
environmental protection is vital for the strategic development of
western China.
</P>
<P>
In the coming decade, Yunnan and Sichuan provinces and four
other provinces and autonomous regions will jointly invest 120
billion yuan (about 14.5 billion U.S. dollars) to conserve the
forests in the upper valley of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
It is the government's goal that by 2020, the forest coverage
rates on the Yangtze's upper reaches will be increased to 45 from

<HEADLINE> China Reshaping Yangtze River With Trees (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Farmers at the upper reaches of
the Yangtze River have turned more than 70 percent of their low-
yield farmland on slopes into grassland or woodland over the past
11 years, greatly improving the local ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
They have given up raising crops and switched to planting trees
on more than 600,000 hectares of farmland, according to Jiao Juren,
director of the Water and Soil Preservation Department of the
Ministry of Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.13 million hectares of farmland disappeared on the
upper reaches of the Yangtze in the period, said Jiao.
</P>
<P>
China officially kicked off a water and soil preservation
project for the upper reaches of the Yangtze in 1989, with more
than 190 counties in seven provinces and municipalities included
in the work.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese law, farmers should replace crops with
trees or take other water and soil preservation measures on
farmland with a slope of more than 25 degrees.
</P>
<P>
Tree felling has been banned in the upper valleys of the
Yangtze, China's largest river.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have been upgrading the conditions for
agricultural production to increase the grain output, as a way to
counteract the grain loss caused by the decrease of farmland, Jiao
said.

<HEADLINE> Sexual Harassment Needs More Attention in China: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- While domestic violence is now
getting due attention in China, one woman expert says that similar
concern should be directed toward sexual harassment against women.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey on violence and harassment
experienced by Chinese women, sexual harassment victims, as well
as women who have been raped, don't always get enough support from
society, said Sun Xiaomei, a professor with the Chinese Women's
College who had the idea for the poll.
</P>
<P>
Many female respondents named six types of harassment as the
worst: inappropriate sexual advances by male superiors in offices,
ex-husbands' harassment of ex-wives, groping on buses, cat-calls
on the street, and sexual misconduct by doctors to women patients
and teachers to students, China Women's News reported.
</P>
<P>
The survey, sampling 4,000 urbanites, covered Beijing, the
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Zhejiang and Hebei provinces.
</P>
<P>
Many surveyed said that they often saw situations of sexual
harassment in public and overheard obscene comments from men to
women at the office, but they didn't realize this type of behavior
constituted a violation of women's rights, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, those surveyed listed murder, kidnapping, rape,
spousal abuse and marital rape as the cruelest forms of violence
against women.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, it is imperative that existing laws on
violence done to women should be amended with more specific
articles as soon as possible so that women's rights can be fully
safeguarded.

BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
metropolis, is forming a community medical network to cover the
whole city, with half of its 95 small hospitals being re-
structured to emphasize neighborhood health care.
</P>
<P>
Many Shanghai residents now can get various types of medical
service for no more than a 15-minute wait at community hospitals,
Shanghai-based "Wenhui Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Weifang neighborhood medical center in the Pudong New District
has established health records for all patients over age 60, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
For an annual fee of 50 yuan (about 6.02 U.S. dollars), each
family in the neighborhood is eligible for two medical check-ups
for family members, on-going medical consultation and other
services each year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that an urban employee in China earns 450 yuan
a month on average.
</P>
<P>
In addition, residents in Shanghai may contact community
doctors, equipped with beepers, at any time, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Confronted with the issue of its aging society, the Shanghai
municipal government started to focus on community hospitals for
the residents' routine health care.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Says Clash with Amal is "Isolated" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Sheikh Naim Kassem, the deputy head
of the guerrilla group Hezbollah, described the clash between his
fighters and those of another Shiite Muslim guerrilla group Amal on
July 15 as "Isolated."
</P>
<P>
Two Hezbollah men were killed and three others wounded in the
conflict with Amal's armed fighters 10 days ago in the former
Israeli occupied zone in south Lebanon, the first such incident
since Israeli withdrawal on May 24.
</P>
<P>
In an address on Sunday, Kassem cautioned against "a conspiracy"
aimed at driving a wedge between the Shiite Amal movement and
Hezbollah, the two main resistance forces during Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Kassem was speaking at a memorial service held in the southern
town of Blida in remembrance of the two killed. The service was
also attended by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and other
officials.
</P>
<P>
"We know that Amal has no intention of provoking sectarian
strife with Hezbollah and the same can be said about Hezbollah,"
Kassem stressed. He added that "what happened last week end was not
a collision between Amal and Hezbollah. It was an isolated incident
and a crime that is punishable by law."
</P>
<P>
Kassem called for safeguarding the "victory scored by the
resistance forces against" Israel. He said the best way to
safeguard this victory is through unity and solidarity between Amal
and Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
The two guerrilla groups are now the main forces controlling
south Lebanon, before government troops move in following a U.N.
confirmation of full Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese army Wednesday filled charges of murder against
five members of the Amal movement accused of being involved in
killing two Hezbollah men.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah was supported by Iran and Syria in spearheading
fighting against Israeli occupation. Its rival, Amal, a Shiite
Muslim movement as well and led by the influential Parliament
Speaker Nabih Berri, was also active against Israeli troops.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Seeks Lebanon's Consent to Peacekeepers Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.N. envoy Terje Roed
Larsen was seeking Lebanon's approval of redeploying U.N.
peacekeepers in south Lebanon at a meeting with Lebanese President
Emile Lahoud and Prime Minister Salim Hoss Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Larsen, who arrived here from Damascus Sunday evening, will also
put the final touches on the redeployment operation of the U.N.
Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in the border zone evacuated by
Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed its withdrawal from south Lebanon on May 24,
ending 22 years of occupation there.
</P>
<P>
Larsen's move followed the completion of a week-long
verification by UNIFIL and Lebanese army teams, which ascertained
that Israel had corrected seven of nine major border encroachments
in line with U.N. Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hoss told An Nahar newspaper that two technical
violations remained uncorrected, but he did not say whether this
would keep his government from allowing the UNIFIL deployment.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General's spokesman Fred Eckhard said in New York
Sunday night that Israel had pledged to correct the two remaining
violations by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
And U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has formally asked the
Security Council to extend UNIFIL's mandate for another six months
as of July 31, provided Lebanon deploy its armed forces in the
liberated zone along with UNIFIL.
</P>
<P>
Several local newspapers interpreted Annan's reference to the
deployment of "armed forces" as a precondition for the extension of
U.N. peacekeepers' mission.
</P>
<P>
However, An Nahar newspaper quoted unnamed government officials
as saying the "armed forces" do not necessarily mean the army. It
also means police and other branches of Lebanon's security forces.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese government contends that its army cannot be deployed to
the region before UNIFIL completes its mission of filling the
security vacuum left by the Israeli withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Nigeria to Cement Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer
and visiting Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo vowed to
strengthen cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Obasanjo's visit marks the beginning of a close cooperation
period between Turkey and Nigeria," said Sezer at a ceremony Monday
morning to welcome the Nigerian head of state, who arrived here
Sunday for a state visit.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo is expected to discuss with Sezer and other Turkish
leaders international and regional issues of mutual concern, as
well as bilateral cooperation, reported Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"We have friendly links with Nigeria rooted in the history,"
Sezer said, recalling that Turkey's relations with the western
African people dated back to the end of the 16th century, when the
Ottoman Empire signed a defense agreement with Kanem-Bornu state
which covered today's northern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Sezer described Obasanjo's visit as "a representation of
political will" to advance relations with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Nigeria is an effective player in both bilateral
ties and international organizations, Sezer praised Obasanjo's
leadership which has led to peace and stability in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to observe that democracy has been maintained in
Nigeria after a long interruption," he noted.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Obasanjo said that his visit aimed to strengthen
and deepen relations with Turkey in every field and to enhance
cooperation. He also noted that the two countries share similar
histories, life styles and religion.
</P>
<P>
Noting that he is the first foreign visitor ever officially
hosted by Sezer since taking office in May, Obasanjo wished Sezer
all the success in his new post.

<HEADLINE> Asian Countries Facing With Opportunities, Challenges: Hu Jintao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
here Monday said the Asian countries are faced with both rare
opportunities and severe challenges in today's world where
profound changes are undergoing.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who arrived in Indonesia on Saturday for a four-day
official visit, made the statement when addressing the Indonesian
Council on World Affairs.
</P>
<P>
He viewed that the achievements that Asia has scored in the
last 100 years are enormous and magnificent, but the course it has
traversed was full of twists and turns.
</P>
<P>
"The seeds of separatism and antagonism sown in Asian countries
by big powers during their colonial rule or rivaling for spheres
of influence have not been eliminated even today. The icy
situation in Asia caused by the East-West Cold War has not thawed
completely. Economic development in Asia is not balanced, and
there are still people being plagued by poverty in some Asian
countries. And in the late 1990s, some Asian countries were
severely hit by the financial crisis, and have since met grave
difficulties in their economic development. We should pay great
attention to these problems and lessons, and address them
seriously," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu said reviewing and reflecting upon the history are for the
purpose of opening up a better future. The world today is
undergoing profound changes, as evidenced by an irreversible trend
toward political multipolarity, a fast economic globalization and
a rapid advancement of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
In facing with this situation, he said, how to effectively
maintain regional peace, promote economic growth and bring about
lasting stability and prosperity in the new century is a major
historical subject before all the peoples in Asia.
</P>
<P>
To this end, he stressed, it is imperative that the Asian
nations make concerted efforts on the following fronts:
</P>
<P>
"Firstly, we should go all out to develop our economies and
improve the living standards of our people. Secondly, We should
strengthen ourselves through solidarity and further enhance
regional economic cooperation. Thirdly, we should foster a new
security concept and effectively safeguard the peaceful and stable
environment of Asia. Fourthly we should vigorously promote the
establishment of a new equitable and rational international
political and economic order in response to the demand of the
trend of our times," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Development bears on state interests, the people's livelihood
and the long-term stability of a country, and it bears on peace
and security of the world as well, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
In economic field, Hu said that countries in Asia should seize
the opportunity and vigorously readjust their development
strategies to accelerate their industrialization, modernization
and marketization.
</P>
<P>
"It is particularly imperative that Asian countries increase
the input in science, technology, and education to foster talents,
attach importance to hi-tech industries, speed up industrial
upgrading and promote a sustained and rapid growth of Asian
economies in the new century so that our people may gradually live
a prosperous life," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting the inter-state economic linkages are becoming closer
and closer, Hu said that the only way to better Asia's overall
development and competitiveness lies in the mutual opening-up,
mutually beneficial cooperation and common development of all in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said: "In this connection, it is important that Asian
countries make use of regional economic cooperation and other
forms of cooperation and draw upon each other's advantages to make
the allocation of resources more effective. We should also expand
our trade and investment, enhance our financial cooperation to
acquire a stronger capability to ward off financial risk, and
promote jointly the economic development of Asia."
</P>
<P>
In connection with the regional stability issue in the region,
Hu reminded that the Cold War mentality still exists and
hegemonism and power politics have taken some new forms, posing a
threat to peace and development of mankind.
</P>
<P>
"A new security concept that embraces the principles of
equality, dialogue, trust and cooperation, and a new security
order should be established to ensure genuine mutual respect,
mutual cooperation, consensus through consultation and peaceful
settlement of disputes, rather than bullying, confrontation and
imposition of one's own will upon others. Only in that way can
countries coexist in amity and secure their development," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that political multipolarization and economic
globalization has became a trend of today's world, Hu said the
trend will have a profound impact on the political, economic and
cultural lives of each and every country.
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that economic globalization apparently
features inequality since it was first initiated and is dominated
by the developed countries without any fundamental change to the
old economic order.
</P>
<P>
Hu said although the developing countries may also have certain
opportunities in economic globalization, they are, on the whole,
still in a disadvantaged position due to their backward economy
and lower level of science, technology and education. This makes
the establishment of a new fair and reasonable international order
all the more urgent.
</P>
<P>
"A new international political and economic order should be
based itself upon the universally recognized norms governing
international relations, meet the need of the development and
progress of our times and reflect the spirit of peace and equality.
It should ensure that all countries, regardless of their size,
wealth and strength, are all equal members of the international
community. All countries have the right to choose the social
system, road of development and the values that fit in with their
national conditions, and they all have the right to fully
participate in the making of relevant rules. World affairs should
be handled by all countries in the world through consultation," Hu
said.
</P>
<P>
Hu stressed that China is ready to work together with all other
countries in Asia to explore new ideas on Asia's future
development and make new headway in economic and social
development.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Government's Tax Takings Surge Up In First Five Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Singapore government's tax
takings surged up by a steep 36 percent increase in the first five
months of this year compared to the same period of last year as
the taxman raked in 7.3 billion Singapore dollars (4.3 billion U.S.
dollars) from January to May this year, local leading English
newspaper The Straits Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The amount was an increase of two billion Singapore dollars (1.
18 billion U.S. dollars) over the 5.4 billion Singapore dollars (3.
2 billion U.S. dollars) in the same period of last year,
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that all major types of taxes reaped hefty
double-digit gains this year, reversing the severe decline in tax
collections experienced over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the same period last year, the income tax, the
number one revenue sources for the taxman, shot up a dazzling 40
percent and yield a handsome 4.4 billion Singapore dollars (2.6
billion U.S. dollars) in the first five months, property taxes-
which was the second-biggest sources of revenue for the taxman
until mid-1997 picked up by nearly a quarter in the period,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that stamp duty collection was up nearly 40
percent in the first half of the year and this is indicative of
the increased activity in the property and stock markets this year.
</P>
<P>
The paper underlined that the goods and service tax (GST)
collection also showed a significant increase, quoting the Inland
Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) as saying that the GST
collected in April and May this year amounted to 645.28 million
Singapore dollars (376.02 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The increase (in tax takings) was largely due to companies
reporting higher corporate profits due to the improvement in the
economy," a IRAS spokesman was quoted.
</P>
<P>
Singapore government is well known for being rich partly on its
tax system which brings in around half of the its operating
revenue every year.
</P>
<P>
The city state experienced tax decline in the past two years
and the tax collection picture was quite dismay a year ago.
</P>
<P>
At the end of May last year, the government's tax takings had
plunged by a whopping one billion Singapore dollars (590 million U.
S. dollars) in the first five months compared to the same period
of the previous year, a 16 percent-plunge with all types of taxes
yielding less.
</P>
<P>
Singapore government's revenue first felt the pinch of economic
slowdown in 1998 which saw tax takings falling by 4.4 percent in
the first five months of the year.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1998, the taxman's takings had fallen by 1.23
billion Singapore dollars (724 million U.S. dollars) from the
previous year.

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao Reveals China's Reform, Development, Stability(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao said here Monday that China has scored tremendous success
in its economic and social developments, thanks to the reform and
opening-up over the last 20 years and more.
</P>
<P>
Addressing before the Indonesian Council on World Affairs here,
Hu said that as a big developing country with one third of Asia's
population and one fifth of Asia total area, China has the
attention of Asia and the rest of the world with its development.
</P>
<P>
"Its national economy enjoys a sustained and rapid growth. From
1978 to 1999, China's GDP increased by 5.8 times, which represents
an average annual growth rate of 9.6 percent. Its agriculture and
rural economy have developed at a high speed, with a big increase
in the output of major agricultural products," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu also said that China's total grain output has been
maintained at around 500 million tons, which has ensured adequate
food for its 1.2 billion people. Its industrial production has
grown continuously through the readjustment of industrial
structure, and the reform of state-owned enterprises has made
important headway.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade has continued to expand with its total
imports and exports during 1978 to 1999 rose from 20.6 billion U.S.
dollars to 360.7 billion U.S. dollars, registering an average
annual increase of 14.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Its foreign exchange reserve has reached 158 billion U.S.
dollars. The people livelihood has been improved markedly. From
1978 to 1999, the urban and rural residents' income increased by 3.
7 times and 2.6 times respectively. The rural poverty population
was reduced from 250 million to 34 million," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Chinese people have made a great
historical step forward in their living standards, from mere
subsistence to a relatively comfortable life.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, all-around development has been achieved in
science and technology, education and all other social
undertakings.
</P>
<P>
"Having said that, we are soberly aware that China is still a
developing country with a relatively low level of development, and
its per capita GDP is still lower than that of developed countries
and even some developing countries as well. We still have a lot of
difficulties and problems on our road ahead. They include among
others: inadequate effective demand, the still serious
irrationality of economic structure, the growing employment
pressures and the ever more acute contradiction between economic
development on the one hand and population, resources and
environment on the other," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Hu also said that the Chinese government have taken and are
still taking a series of macro-economic control measures to
address the issue, saying that initial results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> China to Assist Sri Lanka in Paddy Cultivation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will soon
send four agricultural scientists to Sri Lanka to assist the
island in paddy cultivation, a Chinese diplomat said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said it is the first time that China has sent agricultural
scientists here to train local counterparts. These Chinese
scientists will stay here for three months from September to
December to train 40 Sri Lankans on hybrid paddy cultivation.
</P>
<P>
During the past years, Sri Lanka annually sent several people
to China to undergo training on paddy cultivation in a bid to
increase paddy yield.
</P>
<P>
Rice is Sri Lanka's staple diet. However, the country has not
been self-sufficient in rice except for a brief period in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
From the late 1950s, till the 1980s Sri Lanka imported from
between 350,000 to 500,000 tons of rice on a rubber-for-rice
barter agreement from China.
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000 tons of rice are still imported annually to meet
local requirements.

<HEADLINE> China's Policy on Asia: Hu Jintao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao said here Monday that the Chinese government will stick to
its policy in maintaining the good neighborly and friendly
relations with its surrounding countries.
</P>
<P>
"China cannot achieve development in isolation of Asia, and
Asia cannot realize prosperity without China. It is a consistent
policy of the Chinese government to strengthen the good neighborly
and friendly relations with its surrounding countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Citing that as early as 1950s, China and some Asian countries
jointly initiated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, Hu
said: "It is on that basis that China has established friendly and
cooperative relations with all Asian countries successively," Hu
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the Indonesian Council on World Affairs, Hu
also said that as for the differences left over from history
between China and its neighboring countries, the Chinese
government has always proceeded from the overall interest of all
parties concerned an stood for a peaceful solution of these
differences through consultations on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
"Working in this spirit, China has settled the question of
boundary demarcation with most of its Asian neighbors," Hu added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that China has put forward the proposal of "
shelving disputes and going for joint development" in relation to
the Nansha question and has been actively participating in the
making of code of conduct for preserving peace and stability in
the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have proven that China is an important driving force for
Asia's development as well as an important force for safeguarding
stability in Asia. China's development will pose no threat to any
country. Instead, it will only contribute to peace and prosperity
in the region and the world at large. We sincerely hope that all
the mountains and rivers in Asia will become bridges or bonds of
friendship connecting Asian nations," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hu also viewed that a united and prosperous ASEAN
is an important force for peace and development in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"As a friendly neighbor and a trustworthy cooperation partner
of ASEAN, China always attaches importance to ASEAN's positive
role in regional affairs, respect their efforts in building a zone
of peace, freedom and neutrality and support their economic
integration process," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to expand multi-level exchanges and cooperation
with ASEAN in trade, economic, scientific and technological,
social and other fields, Hu said, adding that China and ASEAN are
highly complementary to each other in term of agriculture,
mechanical and electrical equipment manufacturing, medicine,
transportation and other fields, where the both sides can have
extensive cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Hu is also optimistic that Asia will beam with greater vigor
and vitality in the new century "as long as the peoples of all
Asian countries unite together and work hand in hand."
</P>
<P>
"An Asia of fast economic growth and all-round social progress
will not only be a blessing for the Asian people, but will also
add new splendor to the world civilization. Let us join hands and
work together to build an Asia of peace, stability, development
and prosperity in the new century," Hu said.

<HEADLINE> Ronaldo Hopes For Loan Move to Flamengo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian striker Ronaldo hoped Inter
Milan could loan him to Brazilian club Flamengo to rediscover his
full fitness after long-suffering injuries.
</P>

<HEADLINE> HK Starts to Build Container Terminal 9 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Container Terminal
No.9 (CT9), a massive project of the port expansion of Hong Kong,
was launched here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The start of the work on CT9 is an important milestone in the
overall development of the port," said Donald Tsang, financial
secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), at
the ground-breaking ceremony
</P>
<P>
"With its completion in 2004, container throughput is expected
to exceed the 20 million TEUs (twenty foot equivalent units) mark.
That's the equivalent of handling one box every one-and-a-half
seconds, 24 hours a day, seven days a week," he added.
</P>
<P>
The new terminal, consisting of 6 berths, will be completed and
become operational in phases between May 2002 and late 2004,
according to David Holmes, the project manager.
</P>
<P>
The designed annual throughput capacity of 2.6 million TEUs
will be added to the existing capacity of the Hong Kong's
Container Port of over 11.5 million TEUs, he said.
</P>
<P>
The total site area of the CT9 development is 150 hectares,
equivalent to 139 football fields. One hundred and twenty hectares
of land will be reclaimed from the sea.
</P>
<P>
The terminal itself will occupy 68 hectares. The rest of the
site will be used for access roads, back-up areas for parking and
other container-related uses.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a new marine basin will constructed, and CT9's
quay structure will stretch for nearly 2 kilometers, Holmes added.
</P>
<P>
"The quayside water depth of 15.5 meters has been designed to
handle the increasingly large container vessels which are not only
plying the seas today, but also are planned for the future," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Peoples Make Great Contributions to Progress of Mankind: Hu Jintao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao here Monday said that the industrious, courageous and
talented people of Asian have created the splendid oriental
culture, thus making significant contributions to the progress of
mankind.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at the Indonesian Council on World Affairs, Hu said
in the extraordinary 20th century, the unyielding and hard-working
Asian people have written another grand epic of political
awakening and economic takeoff through their unremitting efforts
for prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"They have thus strongly promoted the historical and social
progress," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
According to Hu, progress and development as such can be
highlighted in the three dimensions : Firstly, the Asian people
have scored a great and historic victory in the struggle for state
independence and national liberation. Secondly, the Asian people
have performed an economic miracle in the process of revitalizing
the economy and getting rid of poverty and backwardness. Thirdly,
the Asian people have made indelible contributions to the
establishment of the fair and reasonable norms underpinning the
post-War International relations.
</P>
<P>
In connection with the struggle for independence, Hu said that
the scourge of the Second World War inflicted tremendous
sufferings upon the Asian people, but it also awakened them to an
unprecedented extent. "Through hard and bitter struggles, dozens
of Asian nations gained independence and billions of Asian people
shook off the shackles of the colonial rule. As a new and emerging
force, the vast number of developing countries in Asia have played
an important role in regional and international affairs," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that in the 1960s and 1970s, quite a number of
countries and regions in Asia adopted a catching-up and overtaking
development strategy in light of their own realities.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, they have risen rapidly from the rubbles of wars
to embrace a sustained and rapid economic growth, hence improving
significantly the livelihood of their people and emerging as a new
driving force behind the world economic growth. Notably, East Asia
has become the most dynamic region with the biggest potential of
economic growth in the whole world. It success has opened up a new
way for backward economies to leapfrog," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the contribution of the Asian people to the
establishment of a fair and reasonable international relations, Hu
said that the Asian people have already played and will continue
to play a significant role in promoting the establishment of a new
international political and economic order that is fair and
rational.
</P>
<P>
It was in Asia where famous Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference which
reflect the solidarity and cooperation among countries in Asia and
Africa were born in 1950s.
</P>
<P>
"Having been commonly accepted as the norms governing state-to-
state relations, these principles have played a positive role in
the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social
systems and in the promotion of friendship and cooperation between
developing countries. They have already played and will continue
to play a significant role in promoting the establishment of a new
international political and economic order that is fair and
rational," he added.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Vows to Restructure Philippine Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
told the country's legislators on Monday that what the country's
economy needs is not just reforms but radical restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said in the opening session of the 11th Congress that
the Philippines must keep up reforms by improving governance,
adhering to sound macroeconomic policy, and by taking measures to
keep the banking and financial system sound, strong, and prudent.
</P>
<P>
Estrada explained in his state-of-the-nation address that one
of the reasons for the country's slower recovery pace comparing to
its Asian neighbors is that the Philippines recovered from a
higher base.
</P>
<P>
However, the president admitted that the more fundamental
reason is that the structure of the Philippine economy today was
inherited from past decades of import-substitution and protective
policies, aggravated by economic mismanagement and corruption.
</P>
<P>
"Our industrial base is thin due to decades of neglect, our
agricultural productivity is low, our population growth rate is
high, and our technology is on a catch-up mode," Estrada added.
</P>
<P>
The president said radical restructuring entails the
modernization of the economy, both physically and electronically,
to make it more productive, efficient, and globally competitive.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Estrada stressed that the country's economy is
recovering smoothly from the Asian financial crisis, citing
moderate growth rate, low inflation, low interest rates, strong
exports, a health balance of payments, and record-high
international reserves.
</P>
<P>
He forecast that the country's economy will grow by an average
of five percent during his term which ends in 2004. "This growth
rate is much higher than what we achieved in the past," said the
president.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Take over State-Level Domain Name From Italian Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria may soon appoint a local
internet service provider (ISP) to take over the administration of
dot ng (".ng") top level domain name for the country, Nigerian
press reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
An Italian firm, currently administrating the domain name, has
informed Nigeria to take over the task by a deadline for August
or has the country's websites under the domain name to be cut off
from the internet.
</P>
<P>
The domain name, registered in 1995, has been managed in Italy
due to the absence of the needed technical infrastructure then,
said Nigerian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government had earlier considered a Nigerian in
the United States to take over the task.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Bank Forecasts Higher Inflation for 2nd Half of 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Korea said here Monday
that the country's inflation rate in the second half of this year
will be higher than that of the first half.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate is expected to rise to 2.8 percent in the last
six months of this year, bringing the yearly to 2.2 percent, said
the central bank,
</P>
<P>
The rise is attributed to increases in public charges,
instability of international oil prices and continued expansion in
economic growth, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the current account surplus will reach around 4.6
billion U.S. dollars in the second half of this year as continued
growth of exports will counter substantial increases of imports.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product in the second half will also drop to
around 7 percent for an annual growth of 9 percent, said the bank.

<HEADLINE> Protection of Tibetan Antelope Beefed up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Tibetan antelope anti-poaching
forces on China's Qinghai-Tibet Plateau received much-needed
equipment today from the China State Forestry Administration (SFA)
and the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW).
</P>
<P>
At two separate ceremonies, SFA and IFAW donated 1.3 million
yuan of equipment to forest police forces in the Hol Xil Nature
Reserve and other reserves where Tibetan antelopes roam.
</P>
<P>
The equipment from SFA includes 4 jeeps, 12 sniper rifles, 10
global positioning systems, 5 radios, 6 pick-up cameras and 25
sets of bullet-proof vests and helmets, totaling 800,000 yuan.
Equipment donated by IFAW include power generators, radios, night
vision goggles, telescopes, tents and sleeping bags.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 there were 75,000-100,000 antelopes on the Qinghai-
Tibet Plateau, a hostile habitat some 4,500 meters above sea level.
However, only about 50,000 survived poaching. Tibetan antelope fir,
known as the "king of wool", is sold, illegally, to make the world
's most expensive shawl.
</P>
<P>
"Tibetan antelope is victim to large-scale commercial
exploitation. It is in grave danger of extinction if we do not
stop large-scale poaching soon," said Grace Gabriel, IFAW's China
Director. She spoke highly of China's efforts in cracking down
poaching of the antelope.
</P>
<P>
To protect the endangered species, China has set up three
natural reserves on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and established a
special police force, known as forest police to crack down on
illegal poaching.
</P>
<P>
SFA Deputy Director Ma Fu said that China will step up its
efforts in fighting against Tibetan antelope poaching, adding that
SFA has allocated 2 million yuan to Hol Xil this year to deal with
the problem. 800,000 yuan will be used to purchase equipment which
will greatly improve the anti-poaching campaign of local forest
police forces.

<HEADLINE> Tattoo Fad Hits Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua)-- Colorful flying dragons, soaring
phoenix, blooming roses and abstractive patterns are now
decorating bodies of Beijing youth.
</P>
<P>
During scorching days in Beijing, fashionable young men and
women boldly show their tattoos which spread across the capital at
an amazing speed, the Shanghai-based "Wenhui Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
At the capital's only tattoo parlor near Dongsi in downtown
Beijing, a 40-year-old woman surnamed Zhou chose a giant rose to
be tattooed on her forearm.
</P>
<P>
The cost of tattoos ranges from 60 yuan (about 7.23 U.S.
dollars) to 300 yuan.
</P>
<P>
A Hong Kong actress, who is preparing a new photo album, even
spent 1,000 yuan for a large pattern displayed on her back, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The parlor, which started trial operation three weeks ago, has
attracted 300 actors, actresses, sports stars and white-collar
professionals. Most of them are in their twenties.
</P>
<P>
There have been mixed responses from Chinese. Some regard it as
artistic, full of mystery and aesthetic, others consider it an
unhealthy social trend among youth, while still others see it as a
passing trend.

<HEADLINE> Israel Sees Four-year High Immigration in 1999: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Israel saw a four-year high
immigration wave in 1999, with 77,000 immigrants coming from around
the world, the Ha'artez daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The total number of immigrants in the 1990s has reached 956,319,
the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Figures released Sunday by the Israeli Central Bureau of
Statistics said that the number of immigrants rose by 20 percent in
1999 over 1998 and the former Soviet Union and other East European
countries were major sources of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, 27,600 immigrants arrived in the
country, down by 8 percent from the same period of last year. And
24,500 came from the former Soviet Union, down from 25,700 in the
first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Israel absorbed 31,000 Russian immigrants last year, versus 15,
000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The number of immigrants from Ethiopia declined in 1999 to 2,300
from 3,100 the year before. And immigrants from North America
dropped by 6 percent last year, while those from Argentina grew by
27 percent.
</P>
<P>
Along with the increase in immigration in 1999, statisticians
also noted a change in the makeup of the new arrivals, with 83
percent of them having been employed prior to their immigration, as
compared to 65 percent in previous years. About 21 percent of new
immigrants are children.
</P>
<P>
Israel received the millionth immigrant from the former Soviet
Union on May 7. Prime Minister Ehud Barak said at the welcoming
ceremony that Israel was capable of absorbing another million, and
more.
</P>
<P>
Israel has now a population of 6.3 million, including 4.9
million Jews, 1.1 million Arabs and 300,000 in other nationalities.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate President Calls for Reforms in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Senate President
Franklin Drilon Monday called on the Senate leadership to pay
attention on the Mindanao situation in order to bring drastic
reforms and rehabilitation in the region.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of the third regular Congress, Drilon said the
conflict in Mindanao is just one of the many problems that the
administration faces today.
</P>
<P>
"Let us focus our collective minds to bring a whole package of
socio-economic and political solution, not just the military might
nor the simple allocation of funds, but a holistic approach to the
rebuilding of Mindanao," Drilon said.
</P>
<P>
Drilon also challenged his colleagues to provide vital economic
reforms to answer the economic problems of the country and to
provide other safety nets.
</P>
<P>
In order to provide more jobs and create an environment of
progress and development, Drilon batted for increased economic
zones, which he said will answer the needs of the working force.
</P>
<P>
The Senate president also asked for reforms prohibiting the
construction and operation of sanitary landfills on watershed
areas and institute an integrated solid waste management program
and forest management.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged his colleagues to address the need of mass
housing. "We must create the Department of Housing to administer
the housing problem and make housing available to our homeless
poor dwellers," Drilon stressed.
</P>
<P>
Drilon, likewise, cited the need for educational system to be
upgraded to meet the challenges of a changing world, saying "it is
time for us to institutionalize the open and distance learning
system."
</P>
<P>
In the administrative reforms, Drilon said there's a need to
take a closer look at the country's tax enforcement measures in
order to increase revenues, not by imposing additional burdens to
the people, but by utilizing a more efficient and effective system
of collection.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Indonesia Ties Continue to Develop: Hu Jintao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao said here Monday that the bilateral ties between China and
Indonesia will continue to develop as the both sides are ready to
enhance trust and expanding beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Indonesian Council on World Affairs here, Hu
noted that Indonesia was the first country among ASEAN (
Association of Southeast Asian Nations) members to establish
diplomatic ties with China.
</P>
<P>
"Over half a century, China-Indonesia relations have, on the
whole, enjoyed continuous development despite some twists and
turns. In recent years, our two sides, working in a forward-
looking spirit, have jointly added a new chapter of promoting
friendship, deepening mutual understanding, enhancing trust and
expanding cooperation to the annuals of our bilateral relations,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that China and Indonesia, two big developing countries
in Asia, have common task and responsibility to strengthen
cooperation, promote development and safeguard the rights and
interest of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that with concerted efforts of both sides,
China-Indonesia good-neighborly and friendly relations and
cooperation will continue to make new progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Indonesia's long and heroic struggles, Hu said,
the Indonesian people had finally overthrown the colonial rule of
more than 350 years and won national independence and that
thereafter, the Indonesian government and people have made
fruitful efforts to safeguard state sovereignty and invigorate
national economy and played an active role in regional and
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Now in Indonesia, we are seeing with our own eyes that the
government and people of Indonesia are doing all they can, through
readjustment and reform measures, to overcome the difficulty
caused by the financial crisis and to bring their economy
gradually onto the track of recovery. We heartily rejoice at your
achievements and sincerely wish you greater success in your nation-
building endeavors," he added.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Unveils First Infocomm Technology Roadmap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 24 (Xinhua)-- Singapore's Infocomm Development
Authority (IDA) has unveiled the country's first Infocomm
Technology Roadmap, a technology blueprint for the next five years
which has identified broadband and mobile wireless as the key
technologies to be focused by the local infocomm industry.
</P>
<P>
The roadmap, made public at a forum Monday attended by
hundreds of experts to share a vision on technology trend in the
infocomm industry, focuses on the two key areas of broadband
access (for fixed-site users) and wireless technologies with
highlights being the broadband access, installation of fiber
access networks in new buildings and homes and third generation
mobile wireless high-quality broadband services.
</P>
<P>
The document was developed through a IDA-led collaborative
effort of some 25 contributing organizations involving vendors,
service providers, system integrators and research institutes in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
In the roadmap IDA foresees pervasive broadband access in
Singapore by 2005 when Singaporeans at home, on the move, at work
and in school will benefit from broadband access. For fixed-site
users, broadband access will be supported by key technologies like
Digital Subscriber Line, cable modem, fixed wireless, broad
satellite as well as optical access net works and for the mobile
population operators will migrate towards the Third Generation (3G)
networks to offer increased data rates.
</P>
<P>
Also in the document, IDA hopes to deliver speeds around 5Mbps
to Singapore homes in the long term and to start off it targets in
the interim Fiber-to-the-Building to 25 percent of all buildings
by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Referring wireless technologies, IDA said mobile users will
enjoy sufficient data rates for Internet and intranet access and
it forecasts that Second Generation (2G), Enhanced Second
Generation (2G+) and Third Generation (3G) networks would co-exist
in Singapore at least until 2005.
</P>
<P>
IDA's Chief Technology Officer Brian Chen told the forum that
the purpose of producing the roadmap is to guide the development
of the infocomm industry through a shared technology vision based
on a good grasp of both technology and market trends and
developments.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the roadmap will be updated with the latest
development once every six months to remain accurate and relevant.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the roadmap is designed to provide a vision
of e-lifestyle in the future for the public, to help industry keep
abreast with future directions and trends, to assist industry to
identify business opportunities and competitive advantages, and to
promote synergy in the infocomm community.

bilateral cooperation towards a healthy and stable future," he
said.
</P>
<P>

into China's domestic jurisdiction and was part of China's
domestic politics. As usual China would spare no effort in
promoting its peaceful reunification process with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"A peaceful resolution to the Taiwan issue is in the common
interest of all the countries in the region. In this regard, we
need to seek support from friendly nations. We highly appreciate
that the Indonesian government has long been standing by the 'One
China' policy," Hu added.
</P>
<P>
Megawati reiterated that the Indonesian government would always
stick to its "One China" policy. As a sincere friend, Indonesia
would uphold this policy and would not have any official contact
with Taiwan, she said.
</P>
<P>

recent years. Ever since the new government was established, it
valued the mutual-supporting and mutual-beneficial cooperation
with China. She sang high praise for the Chinese government for
its painstaking efforts to promote a friendly bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides exchanged views and shared
common ground on the following issues: maintaining multiple-tiered
exchanges, deepening cooperation in trade and economies, mutually
supporting each other in keeping intact national sovereignty and
territorial integrity, enhancing coordination and cooperation in
international and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that since the two countries were among the
big developing nations of the region, they shared the same or
similar standpoints on some of the international issues.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had experienced fruitful coordination on East
Timor, human rights and East Asia cooperation. They expressed
their common willingness to continue coordinating and cooperating
within the framework of the United Nations and other multilateral
venues to maintain peace, stability in the region and to fight for
the righteous rights of the developing nations.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Hosts Colombia Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian government and the
rebel National Liberation Army (ELN) began here Monday a two-day
meeting designed to prepare for a full peace conference.
</P>
<P>
The host country's foreign ministry described Switzerland's
role as that of a facilitator. But the Colombian authorities have
said they may ask the Swiss to mediate between government envoys
and the ELN.
</P>
<P>
A senior foreign ministry official in Berne said Switzerland
had won trust from both sides through its moves to ensure the
respect of human rights in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the talks is for the two sides to agree on a plan to
create a demilitarized ELN enclave in northern Colombia, a place
that the guerrillas want to be the site of a national peace
convention.
</P>
<P>
Envoys from Norway, Spain and Cuba will be present in Geneva to
lend their weight to any agreement. Colombian religious and civic
leaders are scheduled to attend as well.
</P>
<P>
The talks with the 5,000-member ELN are going ahead without the
participation of Colombia's most powerful rebel group, the 15,000-
strong Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government has been holding separate peace
negotiations with the FARC leaders in the past 19 months.
</P>
<P>
Colombia's 35-year civil war is estimated to have claimed 120,
000 lives. The United Nations refugee agency estimates that over 2
million people have been displaced by the fighting.

BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai B-share market index
dipped 0.04 points, or 0.07 percent to 58.21 at the close on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The turnover was 10.10 million U.S. dollars, which was 3.21

according to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and

The market struggled today as it lacked fresh news to renew
buying activity. Negative bias was intact, though the index tried
to mount some effort of rally late afternoon as concerns over mid-
year earnings weighted on investors' sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Losers outpaced gainers by 24 to 18, with 12 unchanged.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ban on Family Violence Urged in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pi Xiaoming, author of "White Paper on Family Violence" and a
well-known woman lawyer, said that Chinese women were usually
victimized because of their physical disadvantage, their economic
dependence on men, and poorer educational backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
According to the NPC official, experts and officials have no
disagreements on the ban of family violence, but they differ in
defining what exactly constitutes family violence.
</P>
<P>
"For instance, should the sexual act not consented by the wife
constitute family violence?" he said.
</P>
<P>
Officials and experts also advocated that in addition to the
existing punitive laws and regulations on family violence and
maltreatment of family members, the new marriage law should also
strengthen efforts to aid victims and deter perpetrators, and thus
better protect the rights and interests of women, children and the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
The local legislature of Hunan Province passed a resolution on
the prevention of family violence in March this year which has
been hailed as China's first legislation against family violence.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Meets Indonesian Business Circle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
Monday called on Indonesian businessmen to develop business
actively in China.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the call during his meeting with President of
Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Aburizal Bakrie,
General Chairman of the Association of Indonesia-China Economic
Social and Cultural Cooperation Sukamdani Sahid Gitosardjono and
other 200 businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Hu said both China and Indonesia are the biggest developing
countries which have a large population.
</P>
<P>
Noting that both governments have paid great attention to the
bilateral trade, Hu said bilateral economic ties have broad
prospects. He said the Chinese government will also encourage
Chinese enterprises to invest in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In their addresses, Bakrie and Sukamdani expressed the hope
that economic relations between two countries will grow in the
future.

<P>
Sino-Indonesian trade volume had risen by three fold to 4.51
billion U.S. dollars in 1997 since the resumption of bilateral
relations in 1990. The trade volume dropped though in 1998 due to
the impact of the Asian financial crisis, but reported a recovery
last year with a 34.1 percent increase in the first 10 months
compared to the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Must Meet Challenges of Globalization: FMs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Unless the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) could cope with the challenges of
the globalization, it will miss the opportunities in the new era,
some foreign ministers of the grouping warned here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"International perceptions of ASEAN remain negative despite
signs of economic recovery in the reign, and it must address this
urgently or risk being marginalized in the new global economy,"
Singaporean Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar said in his speech at
the opening ceremony of the 33rd ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM)
being held here between July 24 and 25.
</P>
<P>
Despite the total population of 500 million people, the 10-
member ASEAN accounted for only 1.5% of world economy, and was
behind in responses to the challenges in the global economy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said ASEAN is not powerless as it had overcome past
challenges and can do it again if redoubling its efforts to
recapture the losses in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he proposed four areas of action: boost
national resilience within ASEAN, forge ahead with ASEAN Free
Trade Area, make ASEAN integration a priority area and move
swiftly and decisively to deal with regional transnational
problems.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Malaysian Foreign Minister Datuk
Albar stressed that globalization and the rapid advances in
technological developments not only present benefits, but also
represent risks.
</P>
<P>
"We should forge common approaches to the challenges
confronting us," he said.
</P>
<P>
It will be critical for ASEAN to ride the wave of the
information age, said Philippine Foreign Minister Domingo L.
Siazon, who also spoke at the session.
</P>
<P>
"We should engage more in electronic commerce, building
infrastructure and addressing the technology capacity gap between
ASEAN members," he said.
</P>
<P>
The three ministers are among 10 ASEAN foreign ministers and
their counterpart from ASEAN observer, Papua New Guinea, who
attend Monday's session of the 33rd AMM.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day AMM, participants will discuss regional
economic issues, cooperation on transnational issues, development
of the Mekong Sub-region, human resource development, among other
political, economic and social issues.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Welcomes Development on Korean Peninsula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) expressed their
appreciation here Monday for the recent development on the Korean
Peninsula, saying that it will help achieve eventual peace and
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 33rd ASEAN Ministerial
Meeting, Indonesian Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab said the Asia-
Pacific countries are "heartened" by recent development in the
sphere of peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The recent inter-Korean summit has raised hopes for the
eventual achievement of long-term peace, security and stability in
the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
The "new atmosphere of goodwill" on the Korean Peninsula could
very well lead to early solution of security issues once deemed "
intractable".
</P>
<P>
"We hope to see very soon the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) contributing positively to the work of the ASEAN
Regional Forum (ARF)," he said.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK will attend the 7th ARF meeting to be held here on
July 27.
</P>
<P>
Somsavat Lengsavad, deputy prime minister and foreign minister
of Laos, also welcomed the Korean summit, saying that it has laid
down the basic principles for pursuing peace, stability and
peaceful reunification of the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke highly of the ARF, noting that the forum has met
a wide range of international concerns, primarily in reinforcing
mutual confidence and seeking ways to address transnational crimes.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the role of the ARF, Alwi Shihab said that while
the ARF remains the key forum for dialogue, consultations and
cooperation in political and security concerns in the Asia-Pacific
region, Indonesia believes that ASEAN should remain its primary
driving force in order to ensure its continuing relevance to the
security concerns of all participants.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ARF must now move its deliberations and
activities substantially forward on the basis of consensus and at
a pace comfortable to all participants.
</P>
<P>
The two-day AMM precedes ASEAN talks with China, Japan and
South Korea and wider bilateral and regional security discussions
bringing in the United States, Russia and the European Union among
others.
</P>
<P>
Besides 10 ASEAN foreign ministers, John Kaputin, foreign
minister of ASEAN observer Papua New Guinea and representatives of
the United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor, the
Southern African Development Community, the United Nations
Development Program and the Gulf Cooperation Council attended the
opening ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Achieves Successes in Preventing Forest Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has achieved successes in
preventing forest fires, according to a report of Vietnam News
Agency Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 250 forests fires reportedly occurred nationwide in the
first six months of this year, said the Forestry Department under
the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the country.
</P>
<P>
The fires destroyed nearly 800 hectares (ha) of forests,
including 259 ha of natural forests and 534 ha of planted forests.
Compared to the same period last year, the number of fires and
level of losses reduced considerably.
</P>
<P>
The forest fire reduction was attributed to local authorities'
drastic measures to prevent forest fires, efforts to publicize law
on forest protection in community, particularly in remote areas.
</P>
<P>
The forestry department of the country has arranged working
groups to supervise forest fire prevention in localities and
coordinated with relevant agencies to give treatment to forest law
violations in the provinces of Kon Tum, Ca Mau and forest fires in
the provinces of Quang Ngai, Dac Lac, Dong Thap, Kien Giang, Ca
Mau.
</P>
<P>
In the mean time, 126,000 ha of forests were planted nationwide,
bringing the country's forest coverage to 30 percent.

CANBERRA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's Sahu Khan will replace
controversial New Zealand-based Charles Dempsey as the Oceania
representative on the FIFA executive, according to the OFC
executive ballot on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Dempsey abstained from a ballot in Zurich earlier this month,
which made Germany the host of the 2006 World Cup at the expense
of favorite South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Dempsey's behavior sparked lots of criticism. He announced his
decision to quit the FIFA executive and Oceania presidency soon
after meeting OFC executives on his return to Auckland.
</P>
<P>
The OFC executive held a meeting in Sydney on the weekend to
vote on Dempsey's replacement. Khan and Vanuatu's Adrian Wickham
each won five votes in the first round of the ballot, and the
decision went to the casting vote of acting president Johnny
Tinsley Lulu of the Solomon Islands.
</P>
<P>
The vote for the OFC presidency will be taken in October.

Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Located in the Shitang Valley, about 70 kilometers outside the

<HEADLINE> New Discovery to Help Solve Riddle of Bird Origin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shenyang, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese paleontologists expect to
make significant breakthroughs in research of bird origins with
the discovery of fossils of a new species of primitive bird that
lived 125 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
The new find in Chaoyang of northeast China's Liaoning province
provides more clues for study into the bird's ancestry and finally
might help solve the riddle of bird origins, said scholars from
the Chinese Academy of Science.
</P>
<P>
Before fossilized ancient birds were unearthed in Chaoyang ,
the archaeopteryx, a primitive bird whose fossils were discovered
in Germany, was long held to be the earliest bird in the world.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the recent discovery, fossils of 10 species of ancient
birds including Huaxiasaurus and Confuciusornis have been found in
great quantity in the area, with the earliest dating back to over
145 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
The newly-discovered fossils showed that the waterfowl-like
primitive bird had strong forelimbs and compact teeth, and was
well-adapted to flying.
</P>
<P>
Fossilized fish of five species and a large number of
fossilized plants were also found with the bird fossils.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat is
likely to accept the U.S. bridging proposals on Jerusalem, a source
close to the Palestinian delegation said on Sunday. Such a response
would mean the Camp David negotiations would continue into the
week, paving the way for a final peace deal.
</P>
<P>
As U.S. President Bill Clinton returned from the G-8 summit in
Japan to the Maryland hideaway on Sunday, the teams at David Camp
prepared for a long night of work, and appeared to be gearing up
for a longer stay.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said the first order of the day would be to
hear Arafat's response to the U.S. proposal made prior to Clinton's
trip to the G-8 summit. Only then, said the officials, would it be
determined whether, or how, to proceed.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- As the Israeli delegation to Camp David braced for what it
believed to be "the night of decision" with Clinton's return to the
talks, the contentious issue remained to be the determination of
sovereignty over the Temple Mount, a site holy to both the Jews and
the Muslims, in the Old City of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior Israeli source, the Americans' "bridging
proposal" granted Israel sovereignty over the sacred site, with a
complex arrangement of Palestinian administration at the Muslim
holy places there.
</P>
<P>
However, Arafat vehemently objects to this plan and has the
support of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who is busy mobilizing
the support of the Arab world to ensure that sovereignty over the
Temple Mount is in Arab hands.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli General Security Service (or Shin Bet) head Avi
Dichter told the cabinet on Sunday that the growing tension over
the possible outcome of the Camp David summit has brought with it a
significant escalation in rhetoric by members of the extreme right
about an assassination attempt on Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Dichter added that there was also talk of killing Arafat or
blowing up the mosques on the Temple Mount in an attempt to prevent
implementation of a possible deal treaty.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The long-awaited deployment of U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL) and Lebanese Army throughout south Lebanon was delayed due
to a last-minute hitch.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL said on Sunday that there is one remaining trouble spot,
a point near Kibbutz Menara where an Israeli Defense Force (IDF)
observation post and patrol route encroach on Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government must approve the U.N. verification of
Israel's May 24 withdrawal before UNIFIL can deploy.

<HEADLINE> Southwest City Suspends Drinking Water from Dianchi Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China's southwest city of Kunming,
Yunnan Province, has decided to stop drinking water from the
polluted Dianchi Lake since July 17, according to the city's water
supplier.
</P>
<P>
Kunming is one of China's 14 cities which has serious water
shortages. The city started to take water from Dianchi Lake, which
makes up 40 percent of the city's total daily water supply. The
country's biggest plateau freshwater lake is among China's most
polluted lakes.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, the city launched a project to ensure the
water supply to its 800,000 citizens by investing 200 million yuan
(24 million U.S. dollars). When the project was finished last year,
the city built more water works to guarantee quality water.
</P>
<P>
Major water works developed water-saving facilities as well as
tapping new water resources. The city has recycled a total water
of 2.5 million cube meters.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the city's water supplier estimate that after
another water supplying project costing 4 billion yuan (482
million U.S. dollars) is complete in 2005, Kunming will stop using
water from the Dianchi Lake.

<P>
BANGKOK, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) must keep its policies implementable and actions
coherent, Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Given the present political and economic diversity in the
region, there should be a comprehensive and coordinated strategy,"
he said at the opening ceremony of the 33rd ASEAN Ministerial
Meeting (AMM), which is held between July 24 and 25.
</P>
<P>
Surin, also chairman of the current AMM, stressed that ASEAN
has been a force for peace and stability not only in Southeast
Asia, but also for the wider security of the Asia-Pacific region
through its mechanisms like the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).
</P>
<P>
He said the regional grouping is now implementing and reviewing
the decisions made at its Third Informal Summit in Manila last
November on an ASEAN "Troika" which could be a means to enable
ASEAN to function more effectively.
</P>
<P>
One of the priorities of ASEAN over the past years has been the
bridging of the existing gap among its members and the removing of
differences in their stages of development, values and cultures,
and those between ASEAN and the outside world, Surin remarked.
</P>
<P>
Talking about ASEAN's economic integration, Surin said, it
should not be only confined to tariff reductions, but also include
almost every aspect of cooperation, liberalization and
facilitation that will in the long run make the group an
economically integrated region.
</P>
<P>
In striving forward, it is incumbent upon ASEAN to move in tune
with the external environment, to be more balanced and
comprehensive, he added.
</P>
<P>
After the opening ceremony, the ASEAN Foreign Ministers and the
Secretary-General will hold a retreat to discuss the challenges
and opportunities offered by a changing world among themselves
only.
</P>
<P>
The current AMM and the Post Ministerial Conference (PMC) to be
held from July 24 to 29 will cover a whole spectrum of issues:
regional financial crisis, transnational cooperation, development
of the Mekong Sub-region, human resource development (HRD) and
social safety net, Surin said.
</P>
<P>
Participants will also talk about the future of ASEAN's
relations, and political and security cooperation with its
dialogue partners, and the implications of globalization for both
of them, according to Surin.
</P>
<P>
The 33rd AMM will be followed by ASEAN+3 meeting (China, Japan
and the Republic of Korea) at the ministerial level, 7th ARF on
July 27, PMC ASEAN+10 Dialogue Partners meeting and PMC ASEAN
sessions with individual dialogue partners between July 26 and 29.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's ten dialogue partners are Australia, Canada, China, the
European Union, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand,
Russia and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Urges for a Comprehensive Development Agenda in ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 33rd ASEAN Ministerial
Meeting (AMM), Chuan said that due to the expansion of ASEAN it is
urgent to consider how to coordinate the member countries'
cooperative endeavors and promote a more comprehensive development
agenda for the new century.
</P>
<P>
He called for greater economic integration, saying that
although ASEAN's combined trade has increased from 10 billion U.S.
dollars in 1967 when the organization was established to 720
billion dollars last year, the ASEAN countries should do even more
to increase their trade, both with each other as well as with
other countries.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister proposed the convening of an ASEAN trade
fair to highlight the economic progress and potential of each
member country, which could be organized once every three years
with Thailand prepared to convene the first.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there have been difficulties for some countries in
meeting their objectives for liberalization because of the
financial crisis, Chuan said ASEAN countries would need to ensure
that their success would not be undermined through backtracking of
commitments.
</P>
<P>
He also raised the issue of the integration of new member
countries into the regional and international economy.
</P>
<P>
"There is a compelling need to expedite infrastructure
development and capacity-building programs so as to ensure the
region's economic integration," he said.
</P>
<P>
Only by closing the gap between old and new members will ASEAN
be able to move ahead with the speed and direction expected of it,
said the premier.
</P>
<P>
To promote a more comprehensive development agenda, Chuan said,
ASEAN should also reach out to the people.
</P>
<P>
"In being more in tune and responsive to our people's needs,
our policies and developmental endeavors should be more people-
centered," he said, urging the organization to consider the
creation of a central fund to support human resources development.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the member countries to address the social and
transnational concerns such as illicit drugs, trafficking of women
and children, transnational crime and environmental degradation
together because "directly or indirectly, now or in the future,
every one will be affected."
</P>
<P>
To promote a comprehensive development agenda , ASEAN should
build itself into "a concert of nations," Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
"While each member country may have its own priorities, there
should be consonance and harmony in our actions," he said, adding
that ASEAN must evolve into a concert of relevance, dynamism and
coherence.
</P>
<P>
To keep up with the changing environment, intra-ASEAN relations
need to be more dynamic, more engaged and more cohesive, the prime
minister said, noting that flexibility and adaptability should be
ensured to maintain ASEAN's preeminent role in the region.
</P>
<P>
Besides the AMM, Thailand will also host the 7th ASEAN Regional
Forum and Post Ministerial Conferences later this week.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Woeful Tales of Child Laborers in Nepal  by Zhuang Meijie, Song Dejun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 24 (Xinhua) -- With a yearning to try his luck
and make money to support his poor family, 14-year-old Kul
Shrestha came to Kathmandu from his village in Gorkha district in
western Nepal to work as a porter.
</P>
<P>
To realize his dream, Shrestha is ready to carry any loads.
However, things turned out to be difficult for him.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I make a good earning, but at times I don't have
money enough to have two square meals," he said with depression
and fatigue in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
Every morning, dozens of children who, like Shrestha, come from
remote villages of Nepal alight from buses at Kathmandu bus park
in a confused state of mind. Uncertainty and ignorance can be read
on their faces.
</P>
<P>
Though harboring wishes and dreams in their heart, they are
soon thrown into despair by the hardship and even danger in the
struggle for survival. Everyone of them has a bitter story to tell.
</P>
<P>
"Once I had a load to be carried to a place 50 meters away. It
was 80 kg and I found it so heavy that I fell flat on the way
injuring my knee," said 13-year-old Ram Bahadur, who looks small
and weak and weighs less than 30 kg.
</P>
<P>
"But what I received from the owner was mere 10 rupees (less
than 2 U.S. cents)," Bahadur said angrily.
</P>
<P>
Although the Nepali government has passed laws and signed
international conventions to prohibit child labor, it has been
accepted as an integral part of the Nepalese economy and society.
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 million Nepalese children under the age of 14, an
estimated 4.8 million have been the victims of child labor and
exploitation. Of them, about 20,000 are working as child porters,
about 40,000 as bonded child workers for landlords and some 70,000
as domestic servants.
</P>
<P>
Other child workers are mainly engaged in construction,
transportation stone quarry, brick kiln, carpet industry and
service industry. The youngest is less than five years old.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of child labor in Nepal is not only the outcome
of poverty and want, but also of social customs and values, said
Gouri Pradhan, chairman of the Child Workers Concern Center of
Nepal (CIWIN).
</P>
<P>
"In addition to the poor economic condition, the social fabric
and customs, deprivation from education and migration from rural
to town areas also attribute to the problem," she said.
</P>
<P>
The prevailing trend is that employers give priority to such
migrant children whom they can employ at cheap rates and use at
will, and their parents also tend to hire them out so that they
will not be a burden to themselves, said Pradhan.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the children have to work long hours under very
difficult circumstances. The average working day is 12 hours, for
which they are woefully underpaid, only half of what an adult get
for the same work, according to a survey by CIWIN.
</P>
<P>
Due to heavy work and poor nutrition, most child laborers
develop chronical ailments, such as respiratory diseases, poor
eyesight, gastro-intestinal problems, pneumonia, malnutrition,
anemia, tuberculosis and skin problems.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government has recognized child labor as a major
social problem and has adopted laws to limit and prohibit it, said
Surendra Hamal, minister of state for labor and transport.
</P>
<P>
Hamal said the government is committed to abolishing the worst
forms of child labor by 2005 and all forms of child labor by 2010
in line with the ILO (International Labor Organization)
conventions.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the commitments by the government, the extreme
poverty, indebtedness, illiteracy and underdevelopment among the
majority of the Nepalese population create barriers to the
enforcement of related laws, said CIWIN.

<HEADLINE> Thai FM Urges for Coordinated Actions Among ASEAN Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) must keep its policies implementable and actions
coherent, Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Given the present political and economic diversity in the
region, there should be a comprehensive and coordinated strategy,"
he said at the opening ceremony of the 33rd ASEAN Ministerial
Meeting (AMM), which is held between July 24 and 25.
</P>
<P>
Surin, also chairman of the current AMM, stressed that ASEAN
has been a force for peace and stability not only in Southeast
Asia, but also for the wider security of the Asia-Pacific region
through its mechanisms like the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).
</P>
<P>
He said the regional grouping is now implementing and reviewing
the decisions made at its Third Informal Summit in Manila last
November on an ASEAN "Troika" which could be a means to enable
ASEAN to function more effectively.
</P>
<P>
One of the priorities of ASEAN over the past years has been the
bridging of the existing gap among its members and the removing of
differences in their stages of development, values and cultures,
and those between ASEAN and the outside world, Surin remarked.
</P>
<P>
Talking about ASEAN's economic integration, Surin said, it
should not be only confined to tariff reductions, but also include
almost every aspect of cooperation, liberalization and
facilitation that will in the long run make the group an
economically integrated region.
</P>
<P>
In striving forward, it is incumbent upon ASEAN to move in tune

</P>
<P>
Participants will also talk about the future of ASEAN's
relations, and political and security cooperation with its
dialogue partners, and the implications of globalization for both
of them, according to Surin.

and the Republic of Korea) at the ministerial level, 7th ARF on
July 27, PMC ASEAN+10 Dialogue Partners meeting and PMC ASEAN
sessions with individual dialogue partners between July 26 and 29.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Estrada Starts U.S. Trip with little Chance for Concrete Results  By Chen Zhanjie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
will leave on Monday night for an eight-day official visit to the
United States where he is expected to discuss some important
issues with ranking U.S. officials, congressmen and business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
According to Philippine officials, the issues of security and
economic cooperation will be the theme of the president's U.S.
visit, while Estrada is also expected to discuss environmental
issue and some domestic problems with U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
First on the agenda is the security relations between the
Philippines and the United States, said Philippine Foreign
Secretary Domingo Siazon.
</P>
<P>
Estrada is credited by Washington with the ratification by the
Philippine Senate in 1999 of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA)
which reopened security cooperation between the two countries
after the expulsion in 1992 of U.S. military bases in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The VFA has paved the way not only for more frequent larger
joining Philippines-U.S. military exercises but also for U.S.
military assistance in modernizing the Armed Forces of the
Philippines and in enhancing their military capability.
</P>
<P>
During the visit which will be formally concluded on July 31,
Estrada will push for a deal that would involve the transfer of
more U.S. patrol helicopters and ships to the Philippines to
address the country's domestic security requirements, said some
analysts.
</P>
<P>
With the United States being the country's major investment
source and top trading partner, economic cooperation will be
another major topic. During his visit, Estrada will reiterate the
commitment of the Philippines to a free-trade and free-investment
regime.
</P>
<P>
Aside from large economic issues concerning investment flow
into the Philippines and the expansion of economic relations,
Estrada is also expected to raise issues like the dumping of U.S.
chicken parts in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Environmental issues, though not specifically the cleaning up
of the toxic waste left by the U.S. forces in their former bases,
are also on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a joint statement to cooperate on environment,
including bases and to work on a framework agreement. We will take
up the details of that," said Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said both sides are discussing a "diplomatic way" to
resolve their differences on the matter. "It's not going to be
easy. Instead of finding fault, what we should do is to solve the
problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada is under pressure at home to discuss with U.S.
President Bill Clinton the issue of toxic wastes left behind by
the United States military at the former Clark Air Base and Subic
Naval Base, which have reportedly killed more than 100 people
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Estrada must not fear making the pitch because he will be
backed up by findings of U.S. government agencies that indeed
their government had left behind hazardous wastes in the
Philippines," said Philippine congressman Juan Miguel Zubiri.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Government Audit Office report concluded that U.S.
military commanders would have gone to jail if the environmental
violations had been committed on the U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
On last Thursday, more than 200 victims of toxic waste
contamination announced that they would file a 102-billion-U.S.-
dollar class suit against the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
The victims are also seeking 52 billion pesos (1.3 billion
dollars) from the Philippine government for tolerating the
presence of toxic wastes in the former U.S. bases and demanding
their immediate cleanup.
</P>
<P>
Estrada is also expected to discuss some domestic problems like
the conflict in Mindanao, where government troops have launched
massive attacks on the secessionist Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MLF) since April and overrun most of the MILF camps.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said the United States will encourage President
Estrada to seek a negotiated settlement of the conflict, setting
the stage for the launching of an economic rehabilitation plan for
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Given the issues that are likely to be raised in the visit and
the fact that President Clinton will step down from office in next
January, analysts said the public should not expect many concrete
results from the forthcoming visit.
</P>
<P>
However, they said, the visit may help improve the Philippines'
image in the world and strengthen President Estrada's position in
dealing with domestic issues like the Mindanao conflict and the
rebound of the economy.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Former collegiate champion John
Capel Sunday defeated Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene, posting
a time of 19.85 seconds in the men's 200-meter final at the U.S.
Olympic trials in Sacramento, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Due to the injuries, Johnson and Greene withdrew from the race
in turn. Johnson fell to the track after running about 80 meters,
grabbing his left hamstring. He was taken off on a medical cart.
</P>
<P>
Greene began to limp with about 100 meters remaining in the
race. He also appeared to have problems with his left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
Capel, the 1999 U.S. collegiate champion, had also defeated
both Johnson and Greene in the event's semifinal less than two
hours earlier. His time in the final was the second fastest in the
world this year.
</P>
<P>
The injuries mean neither Johnson nor Greene will compete in
the 200 meters at the Sydney Olympics. Johnson, who won the 400
at the Trials, will be eligible for that event and the 4x400
meters relay. Greene, the 100 meters Trials champion, will run
that event and the 4x100 relay at Sydney.

Floyd Heard and Coby Miller joined Capel to make the American
squad in the Olympic 200 meters.

have benefit from job-hunting instruction classes, though 83
percent have taken such classes, according to a recently conducted
sample survey.
</P>
<P>
Job-hunting instruction classes offered by universities have
attracted intense attention from university students since they
need to seek job by themselves.
</P>

Statistics from the Beijing Maternity Hospital said that half
of the women seeking abortions there were unmarried and 14 percent
were under age 20. The information was collected by Dr. Suo You
with the Beijing Institute for the Protection of Mother's and
Children's Health.
</P>
<P>
The data revealed that many teenagers wanting abortions are far
advanced in their pregnancies before they turn up at the hospital.
Dr. Suo said that the young people who are sexually active are
most often not well-informed about contraception.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Calls for Religion Tolerance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid called for a religious tolerance and an anti-violence
campaign among religions in the country.
</P>
<P>
Wahid's call came amid mounting demands from the people in the
country to put an end to communal bloodshed which has been taking
place in the provinces of Maluku and North Maluku involving
Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said that Islam would not reach its glory if it resorts
to violence. "Islam loves everyone, Muslim and Non-Muslim," he
was quoted by the Jakarta Post Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The president also reiterated that the central government will
be able to handle the ongoing communal bloodshed in Maluku and
North Maluku. He also revealed that he received a phone call from
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan who told him of a
growing demand for U.N. forces to help stop violence in the riot-
stricken Maluku.
</P>
<P>
"I told Kofi Annan it is better to postpone the deployment of
the U.N. force," Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
Maluku and North Maluku provinces have witnessed a more than
one-and-a-half year communal bloodshed involving Muslims and
Christians. The bloodshed has claimed thousands of lives and
forced thousands of others to take shelter in the neighboring
provinces. The central government has imposed a civilian emergency
and a curfew in these provinces.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Set up Vegetable Cultivation Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A vegetable cultivation zone will
be set up as an agricultural special zone in Yangon division's
Hmawby, a suburban area 48 kilometers from the capital of Yangon,
official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Yangon division commander Major-General Khin
Maung Than as saying that the zone is to be established at a land
area of 4,050 hectares.
</P>

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Australians Deeply Concerned of GM Food Safety By Qi Zijian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Australians are deeply concerned
about the safety of genetically modified (GM) food, with most
saying they would not eat it and an overwhelming majority in favor
of compulsory labeling.
</P>
<P>
The country's AC Nielsen AgePoll, conducted last weekend, found
that 93 percent of respondents to the poll said they wanted GM
food identified with labels and 65 percent said they would not
want it on their plates.
</P>
<P>
Women were significantly more resistant to eating GM food than
men, with just 21 percent in favor compared with 33 percent of men.
</P>
<P>
The poll sounded a warning to the food, agricultural and
biotechnology industries, elements of which have been pushing to
introduce GM products on to the Australian market.
</P>
<P>
Australian doctors and scientists remain divided over the level
of risk posed to human health and the environment by the (GM)
organisms.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Medical Association and the Public Health
Association of Australia argue that testing of GM foods is
inadequate to guarantee their long-term safety.
</P>
<P>
The associations have called for a halt to the production of GM
foods until new methodologies can be developed to assess all the
potential impacts on health both direct and via the environment of
gene technology.
</P>
<P>
Public Health Association President Fran Baum said nothing
would be lost by a cautious approach.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't have all the information, then we shouldn't take
the risks," she said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Professor Peter Schofield of the Garvan
Institute said Australia's regulatory system will ensure gene
technology is safely managed.
</P>
<P>
Some of Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial
Research Organization scientists also argue GM foods will provide
greater food safety by reducing the levels of chemical residues in
food and providing foods with better storage life.
</P>
<P>
Food in Australia is allowed to contain ingredients made from
19 GM crops that have had their DNA modified, so they can make a
bacterial protein that kills insects.
</P>
<P>
All 19 GM foods have been judged safe by overseas authorities,
but only seven have been assessed as safe so far by the Australia
New Zealand Food Authority. Results on the remaining 12 are
expected within two months.
</P>
<P>
The AC Nielsen AgePoll results came as the Group of Eight (G8)
leaders meeting in Japan failed to find common ground on the
future of international trade in GM food, giving big food
exporting nations such as Australia few clues about the future of
the controversial technology.
</P>
<P>
The G8 leaders agreed in principle to set up a panel to tackle
problems linked to GM foods, but the summit communique did little
to suggest that the major trading blocs can reach agreement on
export guidelines and safety standards.
</P>
<P>
The leaders admitted after the meeting that little progress had
been made since the initial GM food flare-up at the last G8
meeting in Cologne, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Canada remain ardent GM proponents,
arguing that firm scientific data is needed on the adverse impacts
of GM foods before cross-border restrictions on the sale of seeds
and food stuffs could be imposed.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien argued at the meeting that GM concerns could easily be
used as a protectionist ruse, thwarting efforts by North American
grain producers to build up overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has imposed a moratorium on approvals for GM
research and has blocked entry of modified goods.
</P>
<P>
Japan has shifted towards the European countries in arguing for
a more "precautionary" approach.
</P>
<P>
The Australia New Zealand Food Authority's governing body, the
council of Australia's federal, state and New Zealand's health
ministers, will meet next week to discuss how to put labeling into
practice.
</P>
<P>
A key question for the ministers is to determine what level of
genetically modified material a food product should contain before
it comes under labeling requirements.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard last month circulated a
letter to the country's health ministers recommending that the
threshold be set at 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, GM opponents claimed a food should only be considered
non-GM if it contains no GM material.

<HEADLINE> Railway Inspections to Ensure Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua)-- The Ministry of Railways is
conducting urgent inspections of railways and related facilities
to ensure safe transportation this summer.
</P>
<P>
The inspections are part of a nationwide push for
transportation safety after several serious accidents in the past
few months.
</P>
<P>
The ministry issued an order to local bureaux to check rail
conditions within their areas carefully, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
Fire-and-flood-control measures along railways should be given
extra attention, the ministry said in the order.
</P>
<P>
When railways are blocked by floods, provincial bureau chiefs
should direct the rescue work and repair rails as soon as possible,
according to the document.
</P>
<P>
Local bureaux are asked to build more bridges in some
intersections along relatively high-speed rail lines (90-120
kilometers per hour), where most accidents have happened.
</P>
<P>
Railway construction sites should be strictly regulated, and
local railway bureaux need to be responsible for on-the-job safety,
the document said.
</P>
<P>
Railway stations are ordered to stop any overloading of cargo
and passenger trains and to severely punish those responsible.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Open Songjiang Export Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua)-- Songjiang Exporting Processing Zone
(SEPZ), southwest of Shanghai, is expected to go into operation by
the end of September this year, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The area is one of the first 15 national-level export
processing zones in the country, which were approved by the State
Council on April 27.
</P>
<P>
As the only one of its kind in Shanghai, the establishment of
the SEPZ has received attention from both the municipal government
and the government of Songjiang District.
</P>
<P>
"The city will try its very best to give personnel, policy and
financial support to the zone," said Vice-Mayor Jiang Yiren.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said construction of the SEPZ had been one of the city's
key projects.
</P>
<P>
Situated in the successful Songjiang Industrial Park, which was
set up in 1992, the zone enjoys a good location with easy access
to toads, air routes and railways.
</P>
<P>
"It is an ideal place for export processing companies from home
and abroad to set up," said Wu Chenglin, deputy director of
Shanghai Foreign Trade and Economic Commission.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the zone, with an area of 1.98 square kilometers, is
aiming to attract 100 enterprises and one billion US dollars worth
of investment and also hopes to employ 15,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The Songjiang zone has 113.3 hectares of land for production
and 23.3 hectares for standard factory buildings.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises wanted for the SEPZ are those involved in
information technology, biomedicine, new-type building materials,
chemicals and light industry.
</P>
<P>
Wu also said the zone has already signed 13 contracts for
investment totaling 115 million US dollars and leased 30 hectares
of land for export processing.

<HEADLINE> Steel Sector Out of Doldrums (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China mapped out a strategic plan to curb steel output and
improve efficiency early in 1999. Now, the measures have taken
effect, and mitigated the imbalance of demand and supply.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, China produced 61.18
million tons of steel, 3.45 percent more than in the corresponding
period of last year, but the growth rate dropped by five
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
As a result, steel prices began to pick up in the second
quarter. The factory prices for construction-use products surged
300-500 yuan to hit 2,900-3,000 yuan per ton in its high sales
period. The average steel prices had stabilized at a reasonable
level of 2,400-2,500 yuan by June.
</P>
<P>
"The market situation for steel products in the latter half of
this year is quite optimistic.," said Pu Haiqing.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the national economy to grow at a fast pace in the
latter half, and increased fixed assets investment and consumption
will stimulate steel trade," Pu said.
</P>
<P>
Although there has been stagnancy in steel prices on the
international market in recent months, the overall demand for
steel products in the latter half of the year will increase as
well, even though it will be weaker than in the first half, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Combined steel consumption nationwide is estimated at 132
million tons for the whole year, experts predicted.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The 200-meter and 400-meter
world records holder Michael Johnson defeated his arch-rival
Maurice Greene in the 200-meter semifinals Sunday at the U.S.
Olympic trials in Sacramento, the United States.
</P>
<P>
But Johnson's time of 20.14 can only rank second among the

at 20.30.
</P>
<P>
This was the first encounter between Johnson and Greene since
1998 and their third overall, but Johnson quitted the first two

<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 23 (Xinhua) -- El Salvador came from behind
to beat St Vincent 7-1 Sunday in a World Cup qualifier at home.
</P>
<P>
St Vincent, who have yielded an average of over five goals a
game in previous World Cup matches against Central American
oppositions, stunned El Salvador by taking a ninth-minute lead
through Jamal Balantyne.
</P>
<P>
El Salvador, thrashed 5-2 at home by Honduras last week,
equalized ten minutes later with a goal by Elias Montes and went
in front in the 34th minute with a goal by Carlos Castro.
</P>
<P>
Normality was restored for St Vincent in the second half when
they conceded five more goals after defender Wesley Charles was
sent off in the 48th minute.
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Rivera scored twice, then Raul Dias Arce wrapped up
the victory with a hat-trick.
</P>
<P>
The win gave El Salvador three points from two games in
semifinal Group D of the CONCACAF qualifying tournament while St
Vincent have none.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Canada and Panama tied 0-0 in
a World Cup qualifier on Sunday, leaving both teams with one point
from two games in semifinal Group C of the CONCACAF group.
</P>
<P>
The host dominated the game although Canada held its own under
the heat with fierce counterattacks. Both teams received yellow
cards, one for Panama and two for Canada.
</P>
<P>
Panama's Luis Angel Rodriguez made the first attempt at scoring,
shooting a long shot that was stopped by Canada's goalkeeper Pat
Onstard.
</P>
<P>
Canada came back with a shot by Jason de Vos that was blocked
by Panama's goalie Ricardo James.
</P>
<P>
Panama also controlled the second half with Julio Dely
attempting to score by heading a pass from Luis Rodriguez that was
blocked by Onstard.
</P>
<P>
Canada counterattacked with David Xausa taking the ball down
the field and making a fierce shot barely caught by James.
</P>
<P>
The top two teams in the group, which also features hot
favorites Mexico and Trinidad and Tobago, will qualify for the

<HEADLINE> Indonesian, European Shuttlers Split Titles in Sanyo Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian shuttlers took men's
singles and men's doubles titles and European players grabbed
other titles in the 150,000 U.S. dollars Sanyo Indonesia Open
which ended here on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Taufik Hidayat beat Ong Ewe Hock of Malaysia
15-5, 15-13 in the men's singles final.
</P>
<P>
Ignoring his injury, the 18-year-old Taufik led 8-5 before
earning the remaining points to conclude the first game 15-5.
</P>
<P>
In the second game, Ong led 7-4 before leading 8-6. Taufik, who
was battling a cold, managed to take over 14-8 due to his leaping
smashes and narrow netting. But he spoiled his match point chance
when he made unforced errors to allow Ong to score 13-14. A
controversial call made by the linesman robbed Ong's chance to win
the second game.
</P>
<P>
"I was really disappointed with the call. I think I had a
chance to win the second game. It was 14-13 and anything could
have happened. I could have forced a rubber set. Some officials
came to me apologizing for the linesman's mistake. I tried to
protest but they said it was over. I had to accept the decision,"
Ong said.
</P>
<P>
Taufik said, "I didn't really see if the shuttlecock was in or
out. I was only looking at the linesman. It was impossible for me
to annul the call," he said.
</P>
<P>
The other trophy for Indonesia was from the men's doubles
through Candra Wijaya/Tony Gunawan, who beat fellow Indonesians
Flandi Limpele/Eng Hian 14-17, 15-6, 15-8.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Danish world number one Camilla Martin grabbed the
women's singles title after eliminating Wang Chen of Hong Kong,
China 11-9, 11-4.
</P>
<P>
In the first game, Wang led 5-2 as Martin made many unforced
errors in the beginning. But the match became tighter as both tied
6-6.
</P>
<P>
Martin began to put the shuttlecocks in blank areas and it was
too difficult for Wang to reach. The Dane finally sealed the game
11-9.
</P>
<P>
In the second game, Martin's way to the title was made easier
as Wang made many errors, especially at the net. Martin concluded
the match 11-4.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy to win here because I didn't expect to go this
far. Wang is a very good player but I think my physical health is
much better than hers," Martin said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised to see that Camilla has improved a lot," said
Wang.
</P>
<P>
Joanne Goode/Donna Kellogg from England beat Nicole van Hooren/
Lotte Jonathans from the Netherlands 7-15, 15-12, 15-10 and took
the women's doubles title.
</P>
<P>
In mixed double final, world number seven Archer/Goode put in
an outstanding performance to stun world's number one from Denmark
Michael Soogard/Rikke Olsen 15-13, 11-15, 15-4.

<HEADLINE> Steel Sector Out of Doldrums (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China's steel sector reversed the
situation in which its profits had been declining for six
consecutive years, and registered a three-fold increase in net
profit in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Strongly boosted by an increase in steel demand both on the
home and international markets, and a hefty price hike for steel
products, the sector reported a 5.43-billion-yuan profit in the
January-June period.
</P>
<P>
"If measures to control steel output and promote exports
continue to be successful, the whole-year profit is likely to
reach 10 billion yuan," said Pu Haiqing, director of the State
Administration of the Metallurgical Industry.
</P>
<P>
The steel sector's economic returns have been on the decline on
a year-to-year basis since 1993, when the annual profit hit a
record high of 29.4 billion yuan. In 1998, the sector's profits
dropped to an all-time low of two billion yuan, and steel prices
went down from a record high of 3,400 yuan a ton to 2,100 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Over-production and low efficiency long hampered the sector's
long-term growth, said Wu Xichun, chairman of the China Iron and
Steel Association.
</P>
<P>
China became world's biggest steel producer in 1996, when its
annual steel output exceeded 100 million tons. Steel output has
kept growing to reach 114 million tons in 1998.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Dissidents Urged to Surrender to Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leone government Monday
warned some of the former pro- government fighters, who later
rebelled again, to come out of the jungle and stop harassing
civilians or risk being treated as armed robbers.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Freetown quoted Julius Spencer,
Sierra Leone's Information Minister, as paying tribute to a
weekend crackdown by U.N. peacekeepers on the fighters known as
the West Side Boys.
</P>
<P>
The West Side Boys were cleared from the main highway between
the capital Freetown and the interior by the Indian, Jordanian and
Nigerian peacekeepers during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Spencer urged those who had fled the U.N. operation and
returned to their camps in the Okra Hills near the strategic
junction town of Masiaka, about 70 kilometers from Freetown, to
report to disarmament camps.
</P>
<P>
"If they fail to do so and continue to cause any harassment
against civilians, they will be held as armed robbers and charged
accordingly," he said.
</P>
<P>
The West Side Boys, who helped topple elected President Ahmad
Tejan Kabbah briefly in 1997 and fought alongside the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels after Kabbah was
reinstated, rallied to a 1999 peace deal.
</P>
<P>
They fought alongside the army and a traditional hunters'
militia when the RUF took up arms against the peace deal in May,
taking peacekeepers hostage and advancing towards Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Some of them quit the loyalist alliance and fought bloody
exchanges with the national army in June after a dispute between
them.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted government officials as saying that a
leading West Side Boys commander, self-styled general Alimamy
Beyoh Cisse, had been arrested in Freetown along with others from
the faction.
</P>
<P>
Beyoh had been pushing for a role in government for the faction,
including ministerial portfolios.

LUANDA, July 24 (Xinhua)-- Lasting war in Angola has severely
affected the country's socio-economic development, said Angolan
Minister of Industry Albina Assis here on Monday while opening
the 17th edition of the Luanda International Fair which will last
until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It is by all acknowledged that the country's economic and

She said lasting war leads to continued aggravation of the
economic distortions that prevail in the country.

The minister urged to put in place a lasting peace coupled with
a program of stabilization and economic recovery in order to
attract interests of international financial institutions and
direct foreign investments.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Considers Power Export for Blackout-Hit Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is considering the
technical feasibility of exporting electricity to neighboring
Kenya which has been heavily hit by a long-lasting power shortage,
officials said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has officially proposed the construction of an inter-grid
connection between northern Tanzania and southern Kenya through
Tanzanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation, they said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Commissioner Bashir Mrindoko for Energy and Petroleum
Affairs in the Ministry of Energy and Minerals told media here
that high powered delegations of the two countries are scheduled
to hold discussions next month on key issues of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
"This is an opportunity for our government, but it's also a
challenge. Our capacity is great but technical evaluation is
required," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kenyans have been experiencing regular power cuts for quite
some time because of the low rainfall, which has reduced the water
levels in the hydro-electric dams.
</P>
<P>
Power rationing is estimated to be costing the Kenyan economy
between 64 million and 117 million U.S. dollars, according to the
Kenya Power and Lighting Company.
</P>
<P>
Kenya was plunged into an unprecedented blackout on Saturday
following interruptions of the bulk power supply from neighboring
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's Owen Falls Hydro-Electric Station, at the source of
the Nile, normally supplies up to 50 megawatts of power to Kenya.
The Ugandan breakdown coincided with a fault on thermal generators
on Kenya's Indian Ocean coast, compounding the problem although
engineers were working hard to restore the situation.
</P>
<P>
According to Mrindoko, there are several options for exporting
power to Kenya and the government is discussing with Tanzania
Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) on this possibility.
</P>
<P>
TANESCO Managing Director Baruany Luhanga has said earlier that
water levels in some dams in Tanzania have also dropped slightly,
but the power supply is backed up by thermal power stations
connected to the national grid.

<HEADLINE> British PM Blair Says Won't Stand Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Monday that he would fight to be re-elected and to remain
the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"If I fight an election, I fight to be elected and to remain
prime minister," Blair told BBC Television, amid speculations that
he might step down early, after securing victory in an election
expected to be held next year.
</P>
<P>
"This is a privilege, this job, and it's an honor to do it.It
is also an immensely exciting job," Blair said, interviewed on a
flight returning from the G8 summit in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I am concerned I will do it but in the end recognize
that however much I may enjoy it, and I do enjoy it,it is for the
British people to make the decision of whether I continue or not,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair, 46, became a parent to a new baby boy earlier this year.
The arrival of his forth child, Leo, prompted rumors that he might
step down from the Downing Street and take a back seat to devote
more time to his family.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Blair has been weakened by a string of leaks, policy
stumbles and a shrinking lead in the opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
His unprecedented opinion poll lead of more than 20 points last
year has been halved in the face of a get-tough campaign by the
opposition Conservatives on crime and asylum.

<HEADLINE> Horn of Africa Needs Food Assistance: Kenyan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
Tuesday said it is estimated that up to 16 million people in the
Horn of Africa are in urgent need of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Moi made the remarks when he was speaking at the official
opening of the Symposium Golden Spear 2000, at Mt. Kenya Safari
Club in Nanyuki in central Kenya, according to a news release from
the Presidential Press Service.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in Kenya, due to the current drought up to 3
million people are in dire need of food and non-food assistance,
saying Kenya has not had a drought of this magnitude in the past.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers and chiefs of general staff from 11 countries
in the Horn of Africa are attending the symposium, which is aimed
at formulating regional strategic concepts for humanitarian
assistance and disaster response within the Horn of African and
the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Moi said that conflicts facing Africa have generated massive
refugee population and internal displacement of persons whose
survival largely depended on humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
He said that poverty was the major cause of problems on the
continent and called for international efforts in ameliorating the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Moi added that the poverty problem in Africa was compounded by
suffocating debt and expressed disappointment that the recent G8
meeting in Japan did not address African debt relief properly.
</P>
<P>
To chart the way forward, Moi said, the symposium must come up
with practical warning response mechanisms by addressing the
difficulties caused by natural and mad-made disasters in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed the need for the region to develop
formidable mechanisms to cope with emergencies through effective
coordination and mobilization of internal resources.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day forum, sponsored by the Kenyan government
and the U.S. Central Command, the participants will discuss the
issues related to humanitarian assistance with a focus on
prevention, management and solution strategies for the region.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Rejects Allegation of Intrusion into Eritrean Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has categorically
rejected Eritrea's allegation over port intrusion and demanded for
an international investigation, local Walta Information Center
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified official of the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry was
quoted as saying that Ethiopia has requested for an investigation
into the allegation that Ethiopian air force planes flew over
Assab on July 17.
</P>
<P>
A foreign mass media reported Monday that Eritrea had claimed
to have shot down two of the three Ethiopian fighter planes
penetrating deep into Eritrean air space in the Assab area.
</P>
<P>
In its letter to various organizations on July 17, the Eritrean
government reportedly described the Ethiopian airforce intrusion
as a clear violation of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement
signed in Algiers on June 18 this year and called on all concerned
to take appropriate measures against Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
In response to Eritrea's allegation, Ethiopia demanded on July
18 that an investigation be carried out into the allegation as
soon as possible in order to establish the real intentions of the
Eritrean authorities.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia categorically rejected Eritrea's allegation as totally
false and pure fabrication, and demanded for the result of the
inquiry to be made public as soon as it is completed.

<HEADLINE> Regional Workshop on Security Opens in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A three-day regional workshop
opened in central Kenya Tuesday with an aim to enhance cooperation
for humanitarian assistance and disaster response within the Horn
of Africa and East Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ministers from Kenya, Egypt, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti,
Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the
Congo and the Seychelles attended the Golden Spear Symposium 2000
at the Mt. Kenya Safari Club.
</P>
<P>
The senior officials were expected to discuss and analyze
regional arrangements to prevent, manage and resolve trans-
regional threats such as genocide, disease, drought, refugees,
narcotics and other issues.
</P>
<P>
The topics will also include humanitarian crises and response
strategies.
</P>
<P>
The conference was a brainwaving of experts to "exchange
experience, views and visions", according to Kenyan Foreign
Minister Bonaya Godana.
</P>
<P>
Godana said that the timing of the symposium was important,
coming at a time when the region was facing an unprecedented
drought.
</P>
<P>
However, it was not an emergency meeting but a long planned
conference, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need to find a comprehensive solution and expand
the countries' humanitarian assistance and disaster response," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Resolutions for future joint exercises in response to
emergencies and disasters and even for regional peace-keeping
missions could be drawn up after the conference, he added.
</P>
<P>
Godana also stressed the need to harmonize military cooperation
with a view to minimize conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was co-sponsored by the Kenyan government and the
Central Command of the United States. Senior officials from
America were expected to attend the meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is to
demolish all illegal structures along rail lines in the country
within the next one month in order to protect people's lives,
Nigerian press reported here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Transport Minister Ojo Maduekwe as saying that
neither residential quarters nor office buildings are to be spared,
adding that the demolition exercise was to protect lives along the
rail lines.
</P>
<P>
He said: "It is the responsibility of states and local
governments to resettle those that may be affected by this order.
I don't want to wait until people are being killed by the trains."
</P>
<P>
On the survival of Nigerian railway, which has only 30
locomotives now, the minister said the solution could come from
the involvement of the private sector in the provision of rail
service using three approaches.
</P>
<P>
One is to encourage the private sector to build, own and
operate rail corridors while the second is to involve them in
building and operating rail corridors for a period of time before
they transfer the corridor to the National Railway Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The third approach, he added, is to involve state governments
in the provision of rail services.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Some 115 people in Karamoja in the
northeastern region of Uganda have died of hunger since June, the
New Vision daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program (WFP) has increased relief rations in
Karamoja as more people die of hunger there, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The WFP, which has employed the Adventist Development Agency to
distribute the food, said it was still compiling a list of famine
deaths.
</P>
<P>
Resident District Commissioner Okoth Nyalulu said the WFP had
not budgeted for the severe famine in the region which was hit by
persisting drought.
</P>
<P>
Local Council Chairman Terrence Achia appealed to WFP to
consider 60 percent of the population as affected by famine as
opposed to the estimate of only 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
But WFP's emergency food operation coordinator John Nyajemo
said the food they gave would be enough if it was not
redistributed by those who get it.
</P>
<P>
"Those who get the food share it equally with their relatives,"
Nyajemo said.

<HEADLINE> Arab Bank Approves Five-Year Credit Plan for Zambia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Arab Bank for Economic
Development in Africa (BADEA) has approved a five-year plan for
Zambia, which will see the country getting favorable loan
conditions, Times of Zambia reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fourth five-year plan running from 2000-2004, would include
reducing the rate of interest ranging from 1 to 4 percent, instead
of an average rate of between 4 and 6.5 percent for the three
previous plans, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to a policy paper presented at the just ended
Consultative Group meeting for Zambia, the bank also decided to
increase the loan period ranging from 18 to 30 years, instead of
14 years, 15.5 years and 18 years respectively in the three
previous plans.
</P>
<P>
The grace period would now range from 4 to 10 years instead of
the previous four-year average.
</P>
<P>
The bank was also exploring possibilities of extending more than
one loan to the same country during the same calendar year.
</P>
<P>
"In our future cooperation with Zambia, BADEA has resolved to
continue its support and to contribute to the government's poverty
reduction program, especially through intervention in agriculture
and rural development, infrastructure and human resource
development," the policy paper said.
</P>
<P>
So far BADEA has contributed to the socio-economic development
of Zambia two disbursements of balance of payments support under
the special Arab aid fund for Africa, four project loans, one line
of credit and two technical assistance grants with a total
commitment of 62.2 million U.S. dollars.

LUSAKA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Commission for
Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has urged African countries to
speak with one voice in order to have weight and compete
effectively, the Post, a Zambian newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Qaqaya, UNCTAD chief adviser for Capacity Building, Law
and Policy, advised African countries to develop a common economic
model so as to ensure their effective competition in the global
economy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview at the on-going regional seminar on Competition
Law and Policy in Zambia's tourism capital, Livinstone, Qaqaya
said countries in the region had numerous needs which if not
properly identified may not withstand the effects of globalization.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that with African countries lacking
multinational companies, they were likely to face extinction from
an open market and as such it was important to identify their
needs and meet them.
</P>
<P>
"For the African countries to compete effectively, certain rules
will have to be applied like the differential treatment which will
take into consideration their weaknesses," Qaqaya was quoted by
the newspaper as saying.

NAIROBI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Two leading Kenyan firms, Bidco
Oil Refineries and Chandaria Industries, are preparing to invest

the Financial Standard weekly reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's Minister of State for Finance, Planning and Economic

for its expansive investment, expected to start at any time this
year, as the final deal is sealed.

unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
Currently Kenya remains the second major source of foreign
investment in Uganda, with the investment mainly going to
transport, real estate, agriculture, agro-processing and

HARARE, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's war veterans have
officially handed over residential stands to more than 4,000
prospective home-owners at Haydon Farm, The Herald reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Haydon Farm is one of the many farms surrounding Harare that
are targeted for residential stands. There are a total of 5,800
stands on the farm, which was lying idle when the war veterans
occupied it.
</P>
<P>
The stands, which range from 400 square meters to 1,000 square

affiliation, had benefited from the occupation of the farm.
</P>

KAMPALA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The fate of Uganda's fish exports
to the European Union (EU) will be decided after EU's experts from
the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) inspect hygiene conditions of
Uganda's facilities in October this year.
</P>
<P>
Lifting of the fish export ban will be based on recommendations
from FVO inspectors, the New Vision daily reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"An inspection of the FVO will take place in Uganda in October
to verify the sanitary and hygiene conditions. Depending on the
outcomes of the inspection, Uganda could be authorized to export
fish products to all 15 EU member states without any time limit,"
EU's head of a delegation in Uganda Bernard Ryelandt was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that "should there be lack of evidence that
Uganda is respecting the EU norms it could even be deleted from
the temporary list to export fish to EU."
</P>
<P>
Ryelandt said due to efforts made by Uganda to guarantee
sanitary quality of it's fish products, the European Commission
could propose to the Standing Veterinary Committee of the EU to
lift the ban.
</P>
<P>
He said the representatives of the 15 member states have
endorsed this proposal.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's farm workers in
commercial farming areas are uncertain about their future as their
bosses scale down operations, with some completely abandoning
their farms, The Herald reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The workers have been left in limbo since their bosses
abandoned their farms due to fears of violence that may be
perpetrated by invading war veterans, although the war veterans,
who have occupied about 1,500 white farms since February, have
vowed to stay out on the farms.
</P>
<P>
President of the Commercial Farmers Union Tim Henwood said
Monday that some farmers had closed down because the war veterans
were threatening them.
</P>
<P>
He said: "They have shut down to avoid confrontation with the
war veterans. It is not a protest against land resettlement, but
just an act to avoid confrontation with the former freedom
fighters."
</P>
<P>
He said it seemed the police did not have orders to react on
the situation on the farms from their superiors and this had made
the situation even worse.
</P>
<P>
"We have asked them to stop working to avoid confrontation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The invasions have now affected the production of some crops
such as winter wheat and there are fears that the country may face
a bread shortage later in the year, The Herald reported.

WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush has selected former Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney to be his presidential running mate, AP reported

The report said Texas Governor Bush plans to offer Cheney the

Cheney, 59, served as defense secretary under Bush's father,
former President George Bush, from 1989-93 and successfully cut
defense spending in his tenure. He was also a key strategist in
the Gulf War.

As a respected public figure with a long record of service,
Cheney was mentioned as a possible vice presidential running mate

The report said former Missouri Senator John Danforth had
remained a possibility, but his prospects faded throughout the

NEW YORK, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell Monday as
a fresh report showed that U.S. personal-computer demand slowed
markedly in the second quarter although overseas sales remained
strong.

Washington because it will give the European company its first
foothold in the United States.

Corp.'s fiber-optic parts unit. The deal worth more than 100
billion U.S. dollars would make Nortel the majority shareholder in

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Telekom Takes Over U.S. VoiceStream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although its income in the first quarter of year 2000 grew by
280 percent to 256 million dollars, its loss also reached 203.3
million dollars during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Unlike most U.S. wireless telecommunication companies that use
CDMA or TDMA standards, the VoiceStream bases its network on GSM
standard, the most popular digital cellular standard in the world.
That makes it easily to dock with the network of Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition still needs approval of Washington authorities,
since the U.S. laws exclude foreign state-owned concerns from its
national market but the German government is the largest
shareholder of Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
If successful, the Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom will gain an
international reach to 375 million mobile customers.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between the two companies on Sunday,
Deutsche Telekom will pay in form of share-exchange and cash. Each
VoiceStream share will be exchanged for 3.2 Deutsche Telekom share
and 30 U.S. dollars in cash.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Telekom expects the new U.S. division to contribute 4
billion euros into its total income, and to win profit after year
2004.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Pipeline Explodes Again Killing 18 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The oil pipeline near Nigeria's
southern oil town of Warri exploded again on Tuesday, the third
time in this month, killing at least 18 people.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Warri, capital of Nigeria's southern
Delta State, said pipeline vandalism was again to blame behind the
accident, killing villagers scavenging for fuel.
</P>
<P>
Buckets, wheelbarrows and jerricans, among dead bodies, were
seen scattered near the site. Villagers, most of them farmers, had
left their fields for the spilling pipeline in the days before the
fire, selling the gasoline to vendors at half price.
</P>
<P>
It is barely a fortnight since an explosion occurred along a
stretch of pipeline between the villages of Adege and Ovire Court
outside Warri, killing more than 200 people.
</P>
<P>
Another explosion near the town one week later killed about 30.
</P>
<P>
Delta State governor James Ibori was reportedly saying after
Tuesday's accident that this was the sixth fire in two months. He
appealed to the federal government for help to tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
Pipeline vandalism, which is referred to as "scooping", is
commonplace in the west African nation's oil rich Niger delta,
despite the huge risks involved.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo two weeks ago accused
black market vendors of acting selfishly and encouraging the
pipeline vandalism.
