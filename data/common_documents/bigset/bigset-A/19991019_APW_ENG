<HEADLINE> Gore Wants Clinton To Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite earlier comments that he was  
considering declining the president's help, Vice President Al Gore 
on Tuesday told Congressional Progressive Caucus members that 
President Clinton will campaign on behalf of his White House bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore ``made clear that the president is a friend who has been  
campaigning for him and will continue to campaign for him, but that 
every election is about the future and that it will be about his 
ideas and his vision for the 21st Century,'' said spokesman Chris 
Lehane. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore told the Washington Post last week he considered the  
campaign a ``very personal quest'' and indicated that he hadn't 
decided what role Clinton would play. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Clinton himself said: ``No one can help anyone else  
in a campaign beyond a certain point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, however, made it clear Tuesday that Clinton would be  
involved in the campaign -- but also that he needs to maintain his 
own identity to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``He explained the difference between being vice president and  
being a candidate for president,'' said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., 
who was at the meeting. ``He was explaining that he is more and 
more becoming his own man without contradicting or repudiating the 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Democrat at the meeting, Rep. James McGovern of  
Massachusetts, said Gore was careful not to distance himself too 
much from Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't try to distance himself from the president,''  
McGovern said. ``He said what he needs to do is make a direct 
connection with the American people, that people will vote for him 
on whether they think he will be a good president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, former  
Sen. Bill Bradley, plans to meet with the group on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides his relationship with Clinton, Gore also discussed a  
proposed minimum wage increase, the earned income tax credit, the 
administration's plan to encourage investment in poor and rural 
areas and Bradley's health care plan.

<HEADLINE> Glaxo: Migraine Gene Nearly Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Glaxo Wellcome PLC said Tuesday it is close  
to identifying the human genes that may cause migraines, 
adult-onset diabetes and psoriasis. 
</P>
<P>
	The company hopes identifying the genes will help develop  
medicines to prevent or treat the illnesses, although no 
discoveries of such genes have been translated into medicines yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The research we are reporting does not mean that we can  
provide cures for the diseases overnight, but it certainly provides 
us with a much better understanding of the genes involved,'' Dr. 
Allen Roses, the drug maker's co-director of exploratory science, 
said Tuesday. ``In the very near future, we hope to understand 
which gene or genes make some people susceptible to these common 
but debilitating diseases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roses was to present his detailed findings later Tuesday at the  
American Society of Human Genetics annual meeting in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the excitement comes with the disease-gene discovery,  
the work only begins then,'' Lee Babiss, formerly with Glaxo and 
now vice president of preclinical research and development with 
Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., told The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Glaxo Wellcome were up $2.56 1/4, or 4.4 percent, to $61  
in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings are the result of a collaboration between Glaxo  
Wellcome, Duke University, the American Diabetes Association, 
Griffith University and the Swedish Psoriasis Group, Glaxo Wellcome 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The technique to isolate genes is called single nucleotide  
polymorphism mapping. Comparing the SNP map from a group of people 
who have a disease with another from people who don't allows 
researchers to focus on a very small section of DNA. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Roses announced his lab had discovered that people who  
inherit a certain version of a gene called Apoe have a high risk of 
developing Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers were skeptical because there had been no previous  
link between Apoe and the disease, but later research vindicated 
Roses by showing the gene does play a role.

<HEADLINE> Nikkei Falls Amid Inflation Concern / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Fears over possible inflation in the U.S. and the  
negative effect it could have on Wall Street pushed Tokyo's key 
stock index lower today. The dollar rose against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed down 21.16  
points, or 0.12 percent, at 17,254.17. On Monday, the average 
closed down 326.24 points, or 1.85 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dollar bought 105.36 yen at 5 p.m. in Tokyo (4 a.m.  
EDT), up 0.34 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late 
New York level of 105.08 yen overnight. The dollar ranged between 
105.24 yen and 105.70 yen during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, the Nikkei index closed paring earlier gains.  
The index opened higher following an overnight advance in New York, 
where the Dow Jones industrial average closed up 96.57 points, or 1 
percent, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors, however, remain skittish following the Dow's plunge  
last week, when the U.S. index recorded its worst weekly point fall 
in history, losing 630.05 points, or 5.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders say that attention will stay on U.S. stocks, which could  
be affected by the release of U.S. consumer price index data later 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were likely to watch that indicator closely amid fears  
that inflation may be rising in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still a chance of the U.S. market plunging, but it's  
probably low,'' said Yoshihiko Kuroichi, manager of the research 
department at Kankaku Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan Motor, which announced a three-year restructuring plan on  
Monday, was among the declining issues. Shares in the company fell 
17 yen (16 cents), or 2.67 percent, to 620 yen ($5.89) at the end 
of daily trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's No. 2 automaker's cost-cutting steps include cutting  
21,000 jobs, or 14 percent of its work force worldwide. It will 
also close three assembly plants in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei average has lost a total of 526.09 points, or 3  
percent, in the last three sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 486.46 million shares, down from 560.42 million shares 
Monday. Retreating issues outnumbered advancers 608 to 593 on the 
TSE First Section, while 140 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section closed up 11.57 points, or 0.79 percent, at 1,471.80. 
The TOPIX closed down 50.03 points, or 3.31 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved higher after gains in New  
York stock prices on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar often benefits from a rise on Wall Street as overseas  
investors must purchase the greenback to buy U.S. shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded between 105.26 yen and 105.70 yen today in  
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was trading at 114.06 yen, down  
from 114.10 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.7800 percent from Monday's finish of 1.7700. Its price fell 
0.08 point to 99.31.

<HEADLINE> Charity Disclosure Forms Put on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the past, donors seeking information on their  
favorite charity's finances might have waited weeks before getting 
the data on pages of public disclosure forms. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, by visiting two new Web sites, people can instantly find  
out what the organization's spending patterns are, what they pay 
their executives and other tidbits that could influence whether a 
donor decides to contribute to a particular group. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think enough donors realize that this information is  
available and that it can be helpful,'' said Stacy Palmer, editor 
of the trade newspaper Chronicle of Philanthropy. ``Now that it's 
so easy to get, more people will realize it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Web sites, which began operating Monday, feature public  
disclosure forms filed by more than 200,000 charities each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors of the sites hope that by posting electronic images of  
the forms, more people will take the time to learn about charities 
they give to. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Form 990 that the Internal Revenue Service requires  
non-profit agencies to submit was available previously on paper 
only. Requests can take a month or two to fulfill and often cost 
money for copying and other administrative costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said the disclosure could prompt charities to improve  
operations on their own, knowing they will be watched more closely. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS is making the forms available to Philanthropic Research  
Inc. and the Urban Institute at reduced rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The project will cost the IRS $5 million over five years. The  
Washington-based Urban Institute will reimburse the IRS with nearly 
$1 million. The private groups are also absorbing other costs to 
set up the sites -- nccs.urban.org and www.guidestar.org. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur W. Schmidt Jr., president of Philanthropic Research of  
Williamsburg, Va., said he hopes the Web sites will help increase 
donors' confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 forms are mostly available now, and the 1998 forms will  
be added as they arrive in the next few months. Although selected 
forms have been posted elsewhere on the Net, this is the first time 
the full set will be available. 
</P>
<P>
	Most groups are required to file Form 990 if they receive more  
than $25,000 in donations in a given year. Exempted are churches 
and other religious organizations. About 200,000 of the 700,000 
charities in the country are required to file the form. 
</P>
<P>
	Form 990s detail charities' revenues, expenses and executive  
salaries. They also include information on board members, programs 
and activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Charities must make their forms available to the public, but  
before this year they had no requirement to mail the form or 
provide copies. The forms also were available from the IRS through 
Freedom of Information Act requests, which take weeks to process. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the IRS will scan the forms as they arrive at a service  
center in Ogden, Utah, and make CD-ROMs available to the private 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Williams, an IRS analyst in the agency's tax-exemption  
division, believes added disclosure should help the IRS spot 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always good to have interested persons out there,'' he  
said. ``They are helping us put sunshine on the financial dealings 
of charities.''

<HEADLINE> Fla. Votes No on Cable Access Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- County commissioners voted Tuesday against  
requiring cable companies that provide high-speed Internet 
connections to share their lines with competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest in a string of local votes on the matter, the  
Miami-Dade County decision is a boost for AT&AMP;T and other cable 
companies who argue that they should not be forced to make their 
equipment available to rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said Tuesday's vote would hasten the spread of  
high-speed Internet service -- also known as ``broadband'' -- in 
Miami-Dade County. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents said it would mean consumers would have less  
ability to choose how they reach the Internet and Internet service 
providers not partnered with a cable company could be forced out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials have declined to step into the fray. They fear  
that regulating the industry could discourage companies from making 
investments to bring these services to consumers quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Just over 1 million consumers in North America subscribe to  
high-speed cable service, compared with 40 million residential 
Internet subscribers total, according to the Federal Communications 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC officials have pointed to these numbers in saying that it is  
too soon to step in and regulate -- but the agency also does not 
want municipalities coming up with their own rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the issue has been played out on several local stages.  
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners in Broward County, Miami-Dade's neighbor to the  
north, voted in favor of an access requirement, prompting AT&AMP;T to 
file suit. AT&AMP;T, which owns cable leader Tele-Communications Inc., 
argued that it spent billions buying cable companies to create a 
national network for local telephone and high-speed Internet 
service and should be allowed to recoup its investment. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T is involved in a similar fight in Portland, Ore. That  
city's ordinance ordering AT&AMP;T to open its cable networks was 
upheld by a federal judge. AT&AMP;T has appealed and arguments in the 
case begin next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-Dade commissioners said they were unfazed by suggestions  
that companies would sue or delay installing high-speed cable, but 
they did express legal concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't our battle. This is the FCC's battle,'' said Katy  
Sorenson, adding ``Let them fight the lawsuits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly feel very uncomfortable regulating interstate  
commerce at a local level,'' said Jimmy Morales. 
</P>
<P>
	National Cable Television Association president and CEO Robert  
Sachs praised the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Miami-Dade County has joined the ranks of those government  
bodies that recognize that regulation is a poor substitute for 
competition,'' Sachs said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Simon, co-director of the openNET Coalition, a lobbying  
group which includes AOL and other Internet providers, called the 
vote ``unfortunate, but -- given the cable industry's threats of 
lawsuits and denial of services -- not surprising. We regret that 
threats have triumphed over competition and consumer choice.''

<HEADLINE> National League Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Among the celebrities out for Game 6 of the  
National League championship series was comic Jerry Seinfeld, seen 
chatting with New York Mets pitcher John Franco during batting 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	After failing to sell out Games 1 and 2 of the series against  
the New York Mets at Turner Field, Atlanta Braves fans finally came 
out Tuesday night for the clincher, and got it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves won it in the 11th inning 10-9 and will take on the  
New York Yankees in the World Series beginning Saturday at Turner 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
	A sellout crowd of 52,335, largest ever for the Braves since  
moving into their new home in 1997, showed up. It may have been 
helped by Seinfeld and other Mets fans, who had watched their team 
lose the first three games of the best-of-7 series before winning 
Games 4 and 5 at Shea Stadium in front of sellout crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	With reasonable fares, the airlines reported flights from the  
New York area to Atlanta Tuesday were filled with Mets fans. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them was Efren Coello, 35, from just across the river in  
Closer, N.J., who had been to all three games in New York and has 
tickets for Game 7, too, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Coello was positive there would be a Game 7.  
</P>
<P>
	He was wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	``I came because I know they can do it. I wouldn't have come  
otherwise,'' the retailer said as he stood behind the Mets dugout 
two hours before the game alongside several hundred other Mets 
fanatics, holding banners and hand-made signs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's Go Mets,'' he chanted along with the others.  
</P>
<P>
	``We Love Piazza,'' read one sign. ``Ya Gotta Believe,'' and  
``Nuttin' Like Da N.Y. Fans!'' were among the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantans weren't as enthusiastic for Games 1 and 2 -- 44,172  
came out for the first game and 44,624 for Game 2, both Braves 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 9,000 seats available before the Mets won Game 5, 4-3  
in 15 innings, but the remaining seats were gobbled up by Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FIGHTING METS:* The Mets were down 0-3. When the New Yorkers  
won Game 5 to get to 2-3 and gain momentum, one Mets beat writer 
even wrote ``The Mets now lead the best-of-7 series, two victories 
to three. Sounds far-fetched. But you had to be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets gave it a battle, overcoming a 5-0 first-inning deficit  
to go ahead 8-7 in the eighth. The Braves tied it in the bottom 
half, then fell behind 9-8 in the ninth only to tie it again in the 
bottom of the inning before winning it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know we were down 0-3, but we fought back,'' said Rick Reed,  
who was scheduled to pitch Game 7 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fought back and we've got a chance. We've had our backs  
against the wall for so long, I guess we're getting used to it,'' 
Reed said before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets had to sweep the last four games of the regular season  
just to make it into a wild-card playoff, then beat Cincinnati in 
that one game, before winning the division series 3-1 against 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is fun compared to those last three regular season games  
against Pittsburgh,'' Reed said. ``That was pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DEFICIT 0-3:* No team in the postseason has ever come back from  
a 3-0 deficit to win the series. In all of the seven-game series in 
baseball, the NBA and NHL, only two teams have ever come from that 
far back: the 1975 New York Islanders beat Pittsburgh in the 
Stanley Cup quarterfinals and the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs won four 
straight over Detroit to win the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what Mets reliever John Franco was counting on.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is impossible. We'll just fight and scratch and claw  
and see what happens. There's always a first time for something,'' 
he said. ``We'll just keep doing what we've been doing. The last 
week of the season, just when everybody counted us out, we found a 
way to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GAME 7:* The pitchers in Game 7 on Wednesday night would have  
been Rick Reed for the Mets against Atlanta's Tom Glavine. Reed was 
the starter in Game 4 on Saturday. He went seven innings and didn't 
get the decision, giving up two runs -- home runs to Brian Jordan 
and Ryan Klesko -- but the Mets won 3-2, scoring twice in the 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine was the 1-0 winner in Game 3. He went seven innings,  
gave up seven hits and struck out eight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to approach it just like it's a regular season game,  
just as I did Game 4,'' Reed said. ``It's what you work so hard for 
in the offseason and in spring training, to get in this situation. 
It's a dream come true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine, now in line to open the World Series on Saturday, was  
hoping the Braves could wrap it up Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're in an awkward situation, hoping you win Game 6 and  
don't have to go to Game 7, so I'm going to be rooting like heck 
that we win so I don't have to pitch. But if we don't win, I'll be 
ready,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	ETC:@ The largest-ever crowd to watch a baseball game in Atlanta  
came during the 1996 division series when 52,529 showed up at 
Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium on Oct. 5 for a game with the Los 
Angeles Dodgers. ... The Braves had won 15 of 16 from the Mets at 
Turner Field going back to Sept. 17, 1997 before Tuesday night. ... 
Three Braves were hit by pitches, the most ever in an NLCS game. 
... Eddie Perez, who went 2-for-3, hit .500 (10-for-20) and was 
selected MVP of the series. ... Mets shortstop Rey Ordonez, who had 
failed in three previous sacrifice attempts earlier in the series, 
accomplished the feat in the eighth, helping the Mets go ahead 8-7, 
but he failed in his fifth try in the 10th, popping to first ... 
Brian Hunter's RBI single in the eighth to tie it at 8 was his 
first hit (1-for-10) of the series. ... The Braves stole six bases 
Tuesday night for a total of 14 in the series, breaking the 
previous NLCS record of 11 set in 1975 by the Cincinnati Reds 
against Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Insurers Announce Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Three of Japan's largest insurance companies  
formally announced their plans to combine operations into a deal 
that would create Japan's largest insurer outside the life 
insurance segment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance Co., Nippon Fire and Marine  
Insurance Co. and Koa Fire and Marine Insurance Co. said Tuesday 
they will set up a holding company by April 2002, and organize 
their operations under the umbrella of the holding company in two 
to three years. 
</P>
<P>
	They will create Japan's largest non-life insurance company,  
with assets of about $57.85 billion, surpassing the current leader, 
Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co., with $51 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsui is now Japan's third-largest non-life insurer in terms of  
assets, Nippon is fifth and Koa eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Their alliance is the latest effort in Japan's financial system  
to tackle global change amid government moves to liberalize the 
sector and make it more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Sumitomo Bank and Sakura Bank said on Oct. 14 that they  
would form the world's second-largest bank, with assets of $922 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	That merger will be second only to the alliance, announced two  
months ago, of three other major Japanese banks -- Dai-Ichi Kangyo 
Bank, Fuji Bank and Industrial Bank of Japan. Assets at those three 
banks total about $1.2 trillion.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton asked high school students  
today to support expanded federal civil rights protections for 
homosexuals, despite Republican opposition that leaves little 
chance Congress will broaden the hate crimes law this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last night the Republicans ... tried to kill this bill when we  
weren't watching, but now we're watching this morning,'' Clinton 
told a group of several hundred students in Washington for an 
anti-violence conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want you also to speak up for that,'' Clinton said.  
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, House-Senate bargainers, dominated by Congress'  
majority Republicans, completed a compromise measure financing the 
Commerce, Justice and State departments. 
</P>
<P>
	It omitted language approved by the Senate in July that would  
have widened the definition of federal hate crimes to include 
incidents motivated by a victim's sexual orientation, gender or 
disability. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was one elephant too much for this boa constrictor,''  
Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., said of the spending bill and its 
wide-ranging provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is likely to veto the overall measure because of  
disputes over hiring police officers and other issues. But the 
White House seems unlikely to demand a restoration of the 
hate-crimes language as a condition for signing the measure, said 
Democrats who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	And with Congress hoping to adjourn for the year in a few weeks,  
that leaves little time or leverage for supporters to push the 
measure through the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's action showed a callous disregard for hate crime  
victims and their families,'' said Elizabeth Birch, executive 
director of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay-rights political 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	The House version of the spending bill did not contain the  
hate-crimes expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of proposals to expand the scope of hate-crimes laws --  
including many conservatives -- have said such legislation creates 
special classes of citizens who are already protected by state laws 
against violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg said the issue was dropped because it should be considered  
by Congress' Judiciary committees. He also said it had become 
``extremely complex'' to resolve differences between two 
hate-crimes bills that were included in the spending measure: one 
by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and a second, stronger version 
supported by the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were omitted.  
</P>
<P>
	The second version was sponsored by Sens. Edward Kennedy,  
D-Mass., Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and about three dozen other 
Democrats and moderate Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	It would have added the new categories of victims to race,  
color, religion or national origin, which are already covered by 
hate-crimes law. It would also expand it to cover any incident 
related to interstate commerce, such as use of a gun made in 
another state. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the federal government can prosecute hate-motivated  
violence if the victim was on federal property or engaged in a 
federally protected activity such as going to school. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing a spate of highly publicized killings, Kennedy said, ``We  
must stop acting as if somehow this fundamental issue is just a 
state and local problem. It isn't. It's a national problem, and 
it's an outrage that Congress has been missing in action for so 
long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Momentum for the legislation had grown after the dragging death  
of a black man in Texas, the fatal beating of a gay college student 
in Wyoming and the July shooting spree in Illinois and Indiana by a 
man police said was a member of a white supremacist group. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch's measure would have expanded federal jurisdiction to hate  
crimes committed after the crossing of state lines, and allow 
federal aid to state and local authorities prosecuting hate crimes.

<HEADLINE> Braves Back in World Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The World Series may seem like a letdown for the  
Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Andruw Jones walked with the bases loaded in the 11th inning,  
giving the Braves a stunning 10-9 victory over the New York Mets in 
Game 6 of the NL Championship Series on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy as hell I'm not pitching tomorrow,'' said Tom  
Glavine, whose scheduled appearance in Game 7 became a moot point 
when the Braves won the best-of-7 series 4-2. ``I'm thankful to be 
going to the World Series -- especially after that series. It was 
gut-wrenching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta did its best to squander a 3-0 lead in the series and a  
5-0 lead in the final game. In the end, they showed the resiliency 
of a champion, just as they had all year. 
</P>
<P>
	When cleanup hitter Andres Galarraga was lost for the season  
because of cancer, the Braves found a way to survive. When Kerry 
Ligtenberg, Javy Lopez, Odalis Perez and Rudy Seanez succumbed to 
season-ending injuries, the Braves came up with players to plug the 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys like Eddie Perez made this team go,'' said manager Bobby  
Cox, referring to the catcher who took over for Lopez and wound up 
as MVP of the NLCS. ``Part-timers who got a chance to get in there 
and play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed Atlanta would finally be able to do things the easy  
way in Game 6, scoring five runs in the first inning to knock out 
Mets starter Al Leiter. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so fast.  
</P>
<P>
	The Mets, as was their custom all season, fought back in  
dramatic fashion to tie the game at 7, then take leads of 8-7 and 
9-8. Both times, the Braves bounced back themselves when everything 
seemed to be going New York's way. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, who was 10-for-20 with two homers and five RBIs in the  
series, got his final hit in the eighth, a one-out single. He left 
the game for pinch-runner Otis Nixon, who stole second, went to 
third on a throwing error and came home with the run that evened 
the score at 8. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Mets went ahead again in the 10th, third-string  
shortstop Ozzie Guillen answered with a pinch-hit single to right. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the Braves won the game with two more unlikely people  
playing key parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Springer, thrust into a prominent role out of the bullpen,  
pitched a scoreless 11th and Gerald Williams, a full-time player 
for the first time, led off the bottom half with a double into the 
left-field corner against Kenny Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are situations where people put labels on you,'' said  
Williams, who mainly played a platoon role until this year. ``But 
you have to have the opportunity to play. I'm just thankful Mr. Cox 
saw fit to put me in the lineup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Williams was bunted to third by Bret Boone, the Mets  
walked the next two hitters, Chipper Jones and Brian Jordan. That 
brought up Andruw Jones, the outfielder who hit two World Series 
homers at Yankee Stadium while still a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't have to do anything so dramatic this time. Now a  
patient 22-year-old, Jones kept watching pitches until Rogers 
delivered a fastball high and outside with a 3-2 count. Williams 
danced across home and Jones pounced on first with both feet before 
being engulfed by his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just exhilarating, exhilarating,'' said general manager  
John Schuerholz, whose team is making its fifth World Series 
appearance of the decade but first since 1996. ``What a year! What 
a game!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the Braves had secured one last chance at their second  
World Series title of 1990s. Game 1 against the AL champion Yankees 
is Saturday at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe by then, the Braves will have recovered from this one.

<HEADLINE> Drug Companies Report Big Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three drug companies on Tuesday reported  
double-digit earnings growth for the third quarter as demand for 
pharmaceuticals increased around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Pfizer beat analysts' forecasts, while  
Bristol-Myers Squibb matched expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw very, very strong performance, especially in the U.S.  
sales,'' said Hemant Shah, an analyst with HKS &AMP; Co. in Warren, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug stocks soared Tuesday, for the first time in weeks, on the  
positive earnings reports. 



</P>
<P>
                         *Johnson &AMP; Johnson    	
</P>
<P>
	Johnson &AMP; Johnson's earnings rose 14.4 percent, propelled by  
strong sales of its drugs for anemia and psychosis. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Brunswick, N.J.-based company had a profit of $1.1  
billion or 80 cents per share, up from $961 million, or 70 cents 
per share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat Wall Street forecasts by 2 cents, according to  
First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 18 percent to $6.7 billion from $5.7 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J, which makes its name selling Band-Aids, Johnson's Baby  
Shampoo and Tylenol, makes most of its money from prescription 
drugs. The company's worldwide drug sales soared 24 percent to $2.6 
billion in the quarter, including 36 percent domestic sales growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales growth reflect strong performance of the Procrit, an  
anemia drug, Risperdal, an antipsychotic medication, and Duragesic, 
a transdermal patch for chronic pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's profession division, which sells medical devices  
and equipment to doctors and hospitals had a sales increase of 20 
percent to $2.45 billion. J&AMP;J's consumer products division had 
sales increase 7.4 percent to $1.70 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J's stock rose $5.25 to $99.75 a share in New York Stock  
Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, the company earned $3.38  
billion or $2.46 per share, up from $2.98 billion or $2.17 per 
share. Sales rose 17 percent to $20.24 billion from $17.29 billion. 

</P>
<P>
                            *Pfizer Inc.    	
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time events, Pfizer's third-quarter earnings rose  
36 percent as Viagra and the company's market leading hypertension 
drug posted strong sales gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer earned $906 million, or 23 cents per share, up from $667  
million, or 17 cents per share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat Wall Street forecasts by 2 cents, according to  
First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer took a pretax charge of $310 million in the third quarter  
related to reducing inventories after the U.S. government 
restricted use of its antibiotic Trovan. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the charge, Pfizer had net earnings of $701 million,  
or 18 cents per share, down 50 percent from $1.40 billion, or 36 
cents per share a year ago, when earnings were inflated by a gain 
for the sale of its medical device unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 20 percent in the latest quarter to $3.99 billion  
from $3.33 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Viagra rose 77 percent to $249 million, as the  
anti-impotence drug continued to be introduced around the world, 
including Japan. U.S. Viagra sales jumped 40 percent to $161 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Norvasc, the world's top hypertension drug, had a 19 percent  
increase in sales,to $2.21 billion from $1.86 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide sales of Diflucan, a treatment for fungal infection,  
were $249 million for the latest third quarter, up 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Zyrtec, an anti-allergy medicine, rose 22 percent to  
$146 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Alliance revenue, from the joint marketing of the cholesterol  
drug Lipitor and pain pill Celebrex with other companies, totaled 
$569 million, up 159 percent from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, excluding one-time items,  
Pfizer earned $2.43 billion, or 62 cents per share, up from $1.92 
billion, or 49 cents per share, a year ago. Sales rose 21 percent 
to $11.70 billion from $9.67 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer's stock rose $2.93 3/4 to $39.93 3/4 in New York Stock Exchange  
trading. 

</P>
<P>
                       *Bristol-Myers Squibb    	
</P>
<P>
	Bristol-Myers' earnings rose 14 percent as robust sales of the  
company's top cancer and diabetes medicines helped overcome slowing 
sales of its cholesterol lowering pill Pravachol. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol-Myers earned $1.10 billion, or 54 cents per share in the  
quarter, up from $966 million, or 47 cents per share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results met the expectations of Wall Street analysts,  
according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 11 percent to $5 billion from $4.5 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The company's pharmaceutical sales rose 15 percent, including a  
22 percent jump in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of the company's Pravachol cholesterol lowering drug fell  
1 percent to $386 million. Pravachol has been the company's top 
selling drug for several years, but it has been losing market share 
to Lipitor, which is co-marketed by Warner-Lambert and Pfizer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Taxol, the company's anti-cancer agent, rose 23 percent  
to $375 million. Bristol-Myers' Glucophage diabetes drug had a 57 
percent sales increase, to $349 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's beauty care sales rose 5 percent to $624 million,  
and its medical devices sales rose 4 percent to $402 million. Sales 
of the nutritional products, including Enfamil infant formula, rose 
6 percent to $466 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, the New York-based company  
earned $3.12 billion or $1.54 per share, up from $2.73 billion or 
$1.34 per share a year ago. Sales rose 11 percent to $14.8 billion 
from $13.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol-Myers's stock rose $4.62 1/2 to $76.12 1/2 in New York Stock  
Exchange trading.

<HEADLINE> Large Spanish Banks Might Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Banco Bilbao Vizcaya plans to merge with  
Argentaria to create Spain's second largest bank, the Bank of Spain 
confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the deal were to be announced at a joint press  
conference scheduled by the banks later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged institution will be second in size to Banco Santander  
Central Hispano, itself the product of a merger announced in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, BBV had been widely expected to hook up with some  
other bank to remain in a position to compete with Banco Santander, 
its traditional archrival. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that BBV would buy  
Argentaria for a price well above its stock market value of about 
$11.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Local news reports said BBV would offer five of its shares for  
every three Argentaria shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, trading of shares in the two banks was  
suspended by Spain's National Securities Market Commission, which 
frequently uses regulatory suspensions to head off price movements 
in the Spanish stock market.

<HEADLINE> Keaton Talks About Being Single </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Michael Keaton, the star of ``Beetlejuice''  
and ``Batman,'' said finding love is one role he just can't seem to 
master. 
</P>
<P>
	``You ask me why I'm single?'' Keaton said while in town to  
serve as chairman at the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's wine auction. 
``I would honestly tell you, man, it is a total mystery to me. I 
would never have bet it in a thousand years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said part of the problem could be his celebrity, although he  
still tries to be the normal guy he always was while handling new 
demands on his time. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding somebody to connect with is hard enough, he said, but  
adding in Hollywood and fame really throws off the equation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get to meet a lot of amazing people,'' Keaton said Monday.  
``The problem is the circumstances always seem off. I can't put my 
finger on it. There's something that happens that doesn't make it 
easy.''

<HEADLINE> Prison Rape Described at Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Sobbing uncontrollably, a former inmate  
described Tuesday how he was raped twice by a notorious prison 
enforcer after guards moved him into the rapist's cell. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Dillard, a slightly built 28-year-old now attending junior  
college in Southern California, said guards asked whether he was 
gay, laughed at his pleas for help and later threatened to put him 
back in the cell if he complained about what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Four guards are on trial for allegedly setting up the rapes to  
punish Dillard for kicking a guard at Corcoran State Prison. The 
guards, who are on paid leave, face up to nine years in prison if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The rapist, convicted murderer Wayne ``Booty Bandit'' Robertson,  
testified earlier Tuesday that Dillard -- who was serving time for 
crack cocaine possession and assault -- was on a short list of 
proposed cellmates he gave to Sgt. Robert Decker, one of the guards 
on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Dillard and Robertson -- both originally from the same Southern  
California street gang -- had tangled before at another prison, 
where Dillard learned of his reputation as a rapist. 
</P>
<P>
	Dillard said one guard threatened him with a longer prison term  
if he didn't go into the cell at Corcoran with Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him he couldn't house me with that inmate. He was an  
enemy and was known for raping inmates,'' Dillard recalled. ``But 
he was being persistent that I had to go in there. I knew he was 
going to rape me. I knew it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge eventually called a recess because Dillard was crying  
so much that his voice was barely audible. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Wayne Ordus suggested that Dillard chose to be  
sodomized because he could have saved himself by refusing to return 
to the cell when he was let out to take a shower. That would have 
prompted a disciplinary process during which he might have aired 
his complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Dillard testified that he couldn't count on prison regulations  
protecting him. ``If they did,'' he said, ``I never would have been 
housed with him.''

<HEADLINE> Celtics Plan To Honor Auerbach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Celtics announced plans Tuesday to  
honor Red Auerbach's 50 years with the team with special events 
throughout the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Auerbach, 82, coached the Celtics between 1950 and 1966, and led  
the team to nine titles, including eight in a row (1959-1966). He 
became general manager in 1968 and president in 1970. Auerbach 
retired as general manager in 1984 and continues as president. 
</P>
<P>
	The celebrations will begin at the 23rd annual B'nai B'rith  
Tap-off Dinner on Oct. 26, during which Auerbach will be recognized 
for his contribution to the Celtics and the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Celtics' first home game against Washington Nov. 3,  
Auerbach will be honored for his role in the team's 16 titles. At 
halftime, former Celtics Bill Russell and Tom Heinsohn will help 
Auerbach raise a banner commemorating his 50 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also plans to honor Auerbach in its the final home game  
of 1999 against Atlanta Dec. 22. The team will recognize Auerbach's 
and the Celtics' place in sports history during the 20th century.

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Torre Still Has the Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- For months, Joe Torre didn't know if he cared  
enough to keep managing. 
</P>
<P>
	Cancer will do that.  
</P>
<P>
	Then, last month in Toronto's SkyDome, with the Yankees'  
division lead dwindling, he learned something about himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden, my stomach started hurting and I realized the  
passion was there,'' he said early Tuesday after leading New York 
past Boston and into the World Series for the third time in his 
four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He is only the fifth Yankees' manager to win three pennants,  
joining Casey Stengel (10), Joe McCarthy (eight), Miller Huggins 
(six) and Ralph Houk (three). 
</P>
<P>
	And now the 59-year-old New Yorker will face a World Series  
opponent that fired him, the Atlanta Braves or New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	But for a while, he wasn't sure he belonged.  
</P>
<P>
	He was diagnosed with cancer during spring training and left the  
team March 10. He had surgery eight days later and didn't rejoin 
the Yankees until May 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``When that whole thing started with the prostate cancer in  
spring training, you really didn't care about baseball,'' he said 
under the Fenway Park stands, trying to put his team's season and 
his life in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go through that -- and when you're going through your  
recovery, you're not sure if you're going to care when you get 
back. Then, once I got back, it was sort of like, let me study 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Torre rejoined the team, he kind of drifted along, as his  
team did for much of the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know a lot of my players had said I was a little bit  
different because I sort of had this philosophy or perspective that 
it's only a game of baseball,'' Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York opened a comfortable lead and wasn't really pressed  
until the Red Sox swept a three-game series at Yankee Stadium from 
Sept. 10-12. David Wells beat them the next night, and the Yankees 
were losing 5-1 -- knowing Boston was ahead and could close to 2 1/2 
games -- before Bernie Williams and Paul O'Neill hit grand slams. 
</P>
<P>
	``That,'' Torre said, ``probably was an emotional turnaround for  
me and I realized how important this was for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, his brother, Frank, had a heart transplant. The story  
of the Torres riveted New York, with Joe finally making the World 
Series for the first time since joining the major leagues in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Torre felt tremendous pressure to win the Series  
after the team went 114-48 during the regular season, setting an AL 
record for wins. 
</P>
<P>
	But since that night in Toronto, Torre has felt he belonged.  
</P>
<P>
	``In the postseason, it's identical to last year, maybe even a  
little more so,'' he said. ``I'm all the way back as far as the 
emotion of what I'm doing. But it's been a wild year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even George Steinbrenner, who spent the 1970s and '80s changing  
managers as often as some teams changed their starting rotations, 
praises Torre. Of course, it's easy for The Boss. Torre wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``When your manager comes through like that, he inspires them,''  
Steinbrenner said early Tuesday. ``He's definitely been an 
inspiration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players agree. Torre has a knack to say exactly the right thing,  
all the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows how to handle every player individually,'' Derek  
Jeter said. ``But he also knows how to handle people 
collectively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre knew the year would be difficult before he went to Florida  
in February, but he was thinking only about the baseball part. New 
York has spent the better part of the last year being measured 
against the 1998 Yankees, a contest they can't win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to warn the club in spring training that we cannot  
compete against ourselves because that's a once-in-a-lifetime-type 
thing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to earn it this year. Last year, when we won so many  
games, a lot of ball clubs felt they sort of didn't have a chance 
against us. This year, I don't want to say they played harder, but 
I think they had a better shot at us. It was probably more 
satisfying this year.''

<HEADLINE> Houston' Elarton To Have Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros right-handed starting pitcher  
Scott Elarton, who pitched through pain toward the end of last 
season, is scheduled to undergo surgery Thursday on his throwing 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Elarton, 23, will have a partial tear of his rotator cuff  
repaired by team physician Dr. Bill Bryan. He is expected to be 
fully recovered by spring training, the team said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first full season in the majors, Elarton was 9-5 with a  
3.48 ERA. He began the season as a set-up relief pitcher to closer 
Billy Wagner before moving to the rotation on July 3. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 4-3 with a 3.83 ERA in 15 starts and is penciled in as

<HEADLINE> Bank One Earnings Rise Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The head of Bank One Corp.'s troubled credit card  
division resigned Tuesday after the company posted flat operating 
profits for the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard W. Vague, 43, who was a co-founder of the First USA  
credit card business, is leaving ``to pursue other interests.'' He 
will be replaced by William P. Boardman, 58, as chairman of First 
USA. 
</P>
<P>
	Boardman previously was in charge of mergers and acquisitions  
for the bank. He also is the chairman of Visa International and 
former chairman of Visa USA. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One's board of directors also named John B. McCoy, 56,  
chairman of the nation's fifth-largest bank. McCoy will keep his 
title of chief executive officer, but will pass the president's 
title and more of the day-to-day operations to Verne G. Istock, 59, 
who was chairman of the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive shuffle come as Bank One's stock trades near a  
one-year low. The company's shares fell 37 1/2 cents to $32.87 1/2 
Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange as investors remained 
concerned about the bank's future performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Bank One reported operating earnings of  
$1.014 billion, or 86 cents a share, compared with $1.005 billion, 
or 84 cents a share, in the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings were in line with Wall Street analysts' forecasts,  
though down considerably from expectations in August, when Bank One 
revealed problems in its First USA credit card unit it said would 
cost it about half a billion dollars in earnings in the second half 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a long road back,'' said Diana Yates, an analyst with  
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ``These types of issue are 
not quick fixes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's credit card revenues fell 1.4 percent from the second  
quarter to $907 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One also saw net interest income fall 5 percent from the  
third quarter last year as competition in the credit card industry 
hurt margins. 
</P>
<P>
	Net interest income totaled $2.27 billion vs. $2.4 billion in  
the third quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Noninterest income rose to $2.1 billion from $2 billion on  
higher loan service fees and deposit account fees. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement about the earnings, McCoy said the company was  
``highly focused'' on stabilizing First USA. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the quarter was $925 million, or 79 cents a  
share. That included charges of $132 million related to the merger 
of Banc One and First Chicago NBD. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, Bank One's net income was $3.07  
billion, or $2.58 a share, up from $2.88 billion, or $2.42 a share, 
for the prior-year period.

<HEADLINE> Mendoza Ends Last Threat by Red Sox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston's bats were quiet and so were the fans. The  
end of the season was just two innings away. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, those bats came alive, fans rose to their feet and it  
seemed the Red Sox would get to play another day, after all. But it 
wasn't to be. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston failed to capitalize on a bases-loaded, one-out threat in  
the eighth inning. A Yankees reliever was the reason: Ramiro 
Mendoza. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was awesome,'' New York's Derek Jeter said. ``He pitched  
well. He really was the MVP of this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York manager Joe Torre used five pitchers to end that rally,  
and New York beat the Red Sox 6-1 in Game 5 of the American League 
championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	The most important of those pitchers was Mendoza.  
</P>
<P>
	Trailing 4-1, Boston had the bases loaded with one out when he  
replaced Allen Watson. Mendoza struck out pinch-hitter Scott 
Hatteberg and got Trot Nixon to pop out to third baseman Scott 
Brosius to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
	He got out of another jam in Game 2 last Thursday night when New  
York took a 2-0 series lead with a 3-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been fantsatic,'' Red Sox reliever Derek Lowe said.  
``This is the second time the guys in front of him caused a jam. 
...He won two games for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He saved our you know whats the last week a couple of times,''  
Yankees manager Joe Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees had taken the lead in Game 2 with two runs in the  
seventh, but the Red Sox threatened in the eighth after David Cone 
had pitched seven strong innings. But Boston loaded the bases with 
one out in the eighth against relievers Mike Stanton, Jeff Nelson 
and Allen Watson. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre turned to Mendoza.  
</P>
<P>
	Again, he struck out the first batter, pinch-hitter Butch  
Huskey. And he ended that threat by getting Jose Offerman to fly 
out to center. 
</P>
<P>
	Series MVP Orlando Hernandez dominated the Red Sox for seven  
innings Monday night. He allowed no runs, three singles and struck 
out nine. And he seemed to be getting stronger. He struck out the 
side in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jason Varitek, who was 0-for-3 with two strikeouts to that  
point, hit a 1-1 pitch for a homer in the eighth and Nomar 
Garciaparra followed with a double. 
</P>
<P>
	That was it for Hernandez, but the Red Sox kept going.  
</P>
<P>
	Lefty Stanton came in and walked lefty Troy O'Leary. Then  
Stanton departed. 
</P>
<P>
	Righty Nelson came in and got righty Mike Stanley to fly to  
center for the first out. Then Nelson left. 
</P>
<P>
	Lefty Watson entered to pitch to lefty Brian Daubach, but righty  
Huskey went up to pinch hit and walked, loading the bases. Watson 
left and took Boston's hopes with him because he was replaced by 
Mendoza, a righthander. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston manager Jimy Williams then sent up lefty Hatteberg to hit  
for light-hitting Darren Lewis. Hatteberg hadn't batted in the 
series and the rust showed as he struck out swinging. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it was up to Nixon, who had struck out twice and walked in  
his three previous at bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Three on, two outs. A homer puts Boston ahead. An out ends what  
loomed as their last threat of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Mendoza pitched. Nixon swung and hit a harmless popup that  
Brosius caught for the third out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had my opportunities,'' Nixon said, ``but he won the  
battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One inning remained, but the Red Sox hopes had already faded  
when Mendoza entered the game. He retired the side in order in the 
ninth for his first official save of the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariano Rivera got credit for the Game 2 save but Mendoza's role  
was just as important. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say enough about what he did in the series,'' Boston  
pitcher Bret Saberhagen said. ``Those are two saves right there. 
Those are two huge saves.''

<HEADLINE> Respiratory Infections on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Hospitalizations for the most common cause of  
respiratory infection among children under 5 have been climbing for 
two decades, and researchers say one reason may be the rise of day 
care. 
</P>
<P>
	The total number of children admitted to the hospital each year  
-- as high as 144,000 -- is also much larger than previously thought, 
the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the American  
Medical Association, looked at respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. 
</P>
<P>
	RSV causes up to three-quarters of cases of bronchiolitis -- an  
ailment that produces wheezing, coughing and difficulty breathing -- 
and up to half of pneumonia cases in young children, especially 
infants. 
</P>
<P>
	People get RSV infections repeatedly throughout life, but the  
first one they catch is usually the most serious, said the lead 
researcher, Dr. David K. Shay of the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	``The peak in hospitalizations occurs at age 3 months,'' he  
said. ``So if you're a 3-month-old all by yourself, you may sail 
through your first winter season without picking it up. But if 
you've got two or three sibs at home and most of them are in day 
care, you may be exposed to the virus at an earlier age, have more 
severe disease and be more likely to be hospitalized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said another reason for the rise in  
hospitalizations since 1980 may be that better tests for the 
illness exist. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers offered no estimate of deaths per year; Shay  
said he is working on that. An estimate made in 1985 put the number 
at 4,500, but Shay said that is too high. 
</P>
<P>
	The only previous estimate of RSV hospitalizations among  
children under 5 came from the Institute of Medicine, a government 
advisory group, which put the number at more than 91,000 in 1985, 
the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new estimate was based on U.S. hospital records from 1980  
through 1996. The researchers came up with a range of about 85,000 
to 144,000 cases a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers reported that bronchiolitis hospitalized 44,754  
infants in 1980, compared with 121,418 by 1996. In 1980 the rate, 
was 12.9 per 1,000 infants, compared with 31.2 per 1,000 in 1996.

<HEADLINE> 'New Novel' Writer Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Fiction writer Nathalie Sarraute, who helped  
developed France's ``new novel'' movement, died Tuesday at her 
Paris home. She was 99. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarraute was best known for her writing on imperceptible  
movements. It was a distinctive style that helped pave the way for 
the ``new novel'' movement, which developed in post-World War II 
France and revolutionized novel-writing by abandoning traditional 
form and content. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarraute's death was announced by her son-in-law, Jean-Francois  
Revel, a philosopher. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarraute turned out her first book, ``Tropismes,'' in 1939 and  
wrote more than 20 works, from novels to plays to essays. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarraute has said that it was with her third novel, ``L'ere du  
Soupcon'' (Era of Suspicion), published in 1956, that she realized 
a new form of writing was emerging that tried to get at the 
``interior drama'' of people's lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take a simple phrase like `it's good,''' she said in an  
interview aired on French television. ``It is the tone in which it 
is said that makes people look to the depths of their conscience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	French President Jacques Chirac hailed Sarraute as ``one of the  
greatest writers of this century,'' and Prime Minister Lionel 
Jospin called her a ``major writer'' who ``honored the French 
language.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born July 18, 1900, in Ivanovo, Russia, to Jewish parents,  
Sarraute came to Paris with her mother at the age of 2. She 
returned to Russia as a child before coming back to France to make 
her home. 
</P>
<P>
	In German-occupied France during World War II, Sarraute at one  
point took in writer Samuel Beckett and his wife, who had been 
denounced to the Gestapo. Beckett would later join Sarraute in the 
``new novel'' movement, which also included Michel Butor, Nobel 
prize winner Claude Simon and Alain Robbe-Grillet. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were not immediately known.

<HEADLINE> Yanks Mum on World Series Opponent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- To a man, they swear it doesn't matter.  
</P>
<P>
	And to a man, the New York Yankees are lying.  
</P>
<P>
	If they really had any say over the draw for this weekend's  
World Series, you know which team that would be? 
</P>
<P>
	Not the Mets or the Braves, but the Bad News Bears -- and even  
better if it happened to be the week Walter Matthau was laid up 
with gout and Tatum O'Neal was under house arrest for trying to set 
the family pet on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	But since the Bears aren't an option, ask any of the  
just-crowned American League champs to choose their NL counterparts 
and watch their brains lock on autopilot. 
</P>
<P>
	After beating Boston 6-1 Monday night, the Yankees are headed  
for their third World Series in four seasons. And apparently the 
fear of saying something that could wind up on an opponent's 
bulletin board has become so great that everybody in the 
organization has learned to say nothing instead. Just broaching the 
subject is like asking to be dropped into the middle of a video of 
``The Stepford Wives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owner George Steinbrenner: ``A New York series would be great,  
but I don't want to offend any of my friends in Atlanta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Joe Torre: ``Whatever way it goes, it goes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher Andy Pettitte: ``Once you get there, it doesn't matter  
who you play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First baseman Tino Martinez: ``The best team will get there  
either way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre: ``I could care less.''  
</P>
<P>
	Batting coach Chris Chambliss: ``Put me down for the same  
answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But scratch the surface and there is no doubt who New York is  
pulling for: 
</P>
<P>
	New York.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah,'' Steinbrenner allowed, ``if the owners of the team we  
wind up playing just happen to be (New Yorkers Fred) Wilpon and 
(Nelson) Doubleday, I wouldn't be mad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What the Mets have done the last couple of weeks,'' Torre said  
admiringly, ``has enabled them to walk with pride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd go all the way to Japan to play in the World Series,''  
Martinez said, ``but sure, sleeping in my own bed for the whole 
Series would be a nice touch. And I got some close pals on the 
Mets. Playing them would be a kick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, a Subway Series would be great, perhaps more than anybody  
who doesn't live there can appreciate. And so just in case it comes 
to pass, here is a primer to help tell one New York team from the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Yankees, it's the manager who doesn't like to talk and  
the owner who won't shut up. 
</P>
<P>
	Over at the Mets, it's the other way around.  
</P>
<P>
	Yankee Stadium has been called baseball's temple, with good  
reason. Behind the left-field wall, there's Monument Park, a shrine 
to some of the greatest players (all Yankees) the game has known. 
On any night, former opera star Robert Merrill might show up and 
sing the national anthem. Public address announcer Bob Sheppard's 
dulcet tones have been described as ``the voice of God'' -- only a 
slight exaggeration. The best seat in the house for a 
regular-season game will set you back $197.53. 
</P>
<P>
	Shea Stadium sits atop a landfill off Flushing Bay. Jets roar  
overhead with numbing regularity. And if you bring an empty Pepsi 
can along, admission to the bleachers is free some nights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees attract the glamorous, hip and powerful. They  
schmooze, they pose, they've never met a photo-op they didn't have 
time for. They are not above cementing business and political 
relationships in the middle of the most furious rallies. Mayor Rudy 
Guiliani is a Yankees fan. So are First Lady Rodham Clinton, 
comedians Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld, filmmaker Spike Lee and 
Donald Trump. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher, on the other hand, is a Mets fan.  
</P>
<P>
	The unkindest cut ever made by the Yankees was Steinbrenner's  
ban on facial hair. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Mets, it was pitcher Bob Ojeda, who lopped off part of a  
finger on his pitching hand while trimming the hedges around his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees made pinstripes in sports famous. They continue to  
protect the brand by only wearing the uniforms for home games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets have no idea which of their four different uniform  
shirts they'll be wearing -- white, gray, black or pinstripes -- 
until the clubhouse attendants lay them out. After being thrown out 
of a game, manager Bobby Valentine confused matters further this 
past June by changing his shirt, then donning glasses and a fake 
mustache so he could return to the Mets dugout incognito. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't work. Valentine was found out, fined $5,000 and  
suspended for two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Only in New York, New York.

<HEADLINE> Air Canada, Partners Fight Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Air Canada is getting help from its major global  
partners -- United Airlines and Lufthansa -- on a plan that would 
ward off a hostile takeover by Onex Corp. and restructure Canada's 
ailing airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The complex $628 million plan disclosed Tuesday calls for Air  
Canada to buy back some of its shares and purchase Canadian 
Airlines, its only major competitor in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	If shareholders accept Air Canada's offer for 35 percent of its  
stock, the company would hold a large enough voting bloc to defeat 
the takeover bid by Onex. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada's shareholders are scheduled to vote on the Onex bid  
at a Nov. 8 meeting in Montreal, with a two-thirds majority needed 
for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am extremely confident in the shareholder support we have  
and our ability to achieve an outcome where our shareholders 
support the management and board position of Air Canada,'' said 
Robert Milton, the airline's president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	His announcement was designed to counter the Onex plan to merge  
the two Canadian airlines into one national carrier, with a loss of 
about 5,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto-based Onex offered $1.2 billion in cash and stock to  
take over the Canadian carriers in August. It would also assume 
$2.7 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The Onex offer is worth $5.85 a share for Air Canada, though  
Onex says the real value is about $8 a share if stockholders accept 
shares in the new merged airline as partial payment. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Tuesday, Air Canada shares rose 24 cents to $6.82  
while Canadian Airlines shares gained almost 5 cents to $1.19. Onex 
rose more 20 cents to $16.39. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada is offering $540 million in cash for 35 percent of  
its stock -- about $8 per share for 66 million shares. Air Canada 
also is offering $62 million for Canadian Airlines -- about $1.40 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada plans to operate Canadian Airlines, based in Calgary,  
as a separate company. In addition, Air Canada would start up a new 
discount regional airline based in Hamilton to serve about 20 
Canadian cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, Lufthansa and United Airlines are providing a  
$493 million financial package that includes purchasing preferred 
Air Canada stock, buying and leasing back three Air Canada Airbus 
A330 planes and guaranteeing credit to Air Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan also includes a $135 million payment to Air Canada by  
the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in return for warrants to 
buy non-voting shares that can be exercised over a five-year 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Milton said around 2,500 jobs would be cut, all of them at  
Canadian Airlines, if his plan were adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	If successful, the Air Canada plan will make it the nation's  
dominant carrier with the power to further restructure an industry 
that has lost money for much of the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The question of who should run the nation's airlines issue has  
touched sensitive business and political nerves in Canada, 
including fears of growing U.S. dominance over Canadian enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada claims the Onex bid is a thinly disguised attempt by  
American Airlines to gain control of Canadian skies. AMR Corp., 
American Airlines' parent company which is backing the Onex bid, 
now owns 25 percent of Canadian Airlines and would own 15 percent 
of the new, merged airline. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR chairman Donald Carty says American has no interest in  
running a Canadian airline. What it wants are routes to Asia from 
Vancouver and to Europe from Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Kavafian, an airline analyst with Yorkton Securities in  
Toronto, said the Air Canada plan depends on AMR agreeing to sell 
its stake in Canadian Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The takeover battle pits global air alliances against each  
other. American's Oneworld, with partners like Canadian Airlines, 
Quantas of Australia and British Airways, is bidding against the 
Star Alliance, with United Airlines, Air Canada and Germany's 
Lufthansa. 
</P>
<P>
	These integrated networks allow travelers to accumulate and  
redeem frequent-flyer points on any of the allied airlines. 
Travelers can also buy a ticket through one carrier to the 
destinations of any of its partners, allowing each airline to offer 
hundreds of international destinations. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union has questioned the Onex plan, saying it would  
hinder competition for flights between London and Canadian 
airports. The EU's top antitrust official said Tuesday that Air 
Canada and Canadian Airlines will have to release landing and 
take-off slots for transatlantic flights to secure clearance from 
EU regulators for the Onex merger plan. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the EU noted that government agreements authorize  
only British Airways and the two Canadian carriers to fly direct 
between Canada and London's Heathrow airport.

<HEADLINE> Weirton Steel, WHX Cancel Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHEELING, W.Va. (AP) -- West Virginia's two main steel producers  
officially ended talks about a possible merger Tuesday, more than 
two months after it became clear they were far from a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing more to say about it,'' said WHX Corp.'s James  
Kosowski, spokesman for the parent of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel 
parent. 
</P>
<P>
	Weirton Steel Corp., the nation's eighth-largest steel maker,  
and Wheeling-Pitt, the ninth-largest, had been exploring ways to 
gain an edge in an industry that has struggled with low-priced 
foreign imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The two firms produce a combined total of about 5 million tons  
of steel per year; their goal in a merger was to raise that to at 
least 6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	WHX initially planned to cancel negotiations in August but was  
persuaded to remain at the table, Wheeling-Pitt Chairman Paul Bucha 
said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	A merger might have shut down pieces of equipment in either  
plant but was not expected to create any significant operating 
changes in the mills. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfortunate that so many insurmountable obstacles were  
introduced to such a potentially viable business combination,'' 
said Weirton Steel President Richard Riederer, declining to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Weirton Steel will continue to pursue other opportunities to  
strengthen its position in the market, he said.

<HEADLINE> Mark West Rejoins Suns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Sixteen-year NBA veteran Mark West signed on for  
a second tour of duty with the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 center's trademark is sure shooting. He's second  
in NBA history to Artis Gilmore in field-goal percentage (.581 to 
.599). West was even better during six-plus seasons in Phoenix, 
averaging 7.2 points and 6.2 rebounds while shooting 61.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	West played for Dallas in 1983-84, and spent parts of the next  
season with Milwaukee and Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavaliers traded him and point guard Kevin Johnson to the  
Suns on Feb. 25, 1988, and West went on to play in 521 consecutive 
games before the Suns traded him to Detroit in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to Cleveland in 1996-97, spent the next season with  
Indiana and was a backup for Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo last season. 
He played in 49 of 50 games for the Hawks, averaging 1.2 points and 
2.2 rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Manuel Tops Indians' Manager List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Charlie Manuel, Cleveland's hitting instructor,  
is the leading candidate to become the next manager of the Indians, 
who fired Mike Hargrove last week after the club's playoff 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charlie has to be,'' Cleveland assistant general manager Mark  
Shapiro said. ``He's the guy who we know the best. Someone is going 
to have to come in here and be pretty impressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manuel, a former minor league manager who has been in the  
Indians organization since 1993, is expected to interview for the 
job later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro, though, said that doesn't mean anyone should rush to  
any conclusions and said the club is in no hurry to fill the 
vacancy. Cleveland GM John Hart said last week that the Indians 
might consider those with no managerial experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to put any time frame on it,'' Shapiro said.  
``We've got two lists, one long one with 20-25 names, the other has 
five or six.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New names have been popping up on a daily basis as the club  
begins its search to replace Hargrove, fired last Friday just days 
after the Indians blew a 2-0 lead in the AL division series against 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Hall of Famer George Brett said he was contacted  
last week by former Kansas City Royals teammate Bud Black, now a 
scout and roving pitching instructor for Cleveland, about the 
Indians' job. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Shapiro said there have been no formal talks between  
the Indians and Brett, currently a vice president with Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not contacted George Brett about the manager's job,''  
Shapiro said. ``Bud Black and George are good friends, and Bud has 
talked with him but that's another issue. We have not. He's not on 
our short list. But that doesn't mean we wouldn't be interested in 
talking to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another prominent name hoping for a chance to talk to the  
Indians is pitcher Orel Hershiser. Hershiser spent three seasons 
with Cleveland, going 45-21 and winning the ALCS MVP in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He was invited to the Indians' training camp this spring, but  
when the club couldn't fit him into their starting rotation, the 
right-hander signed with the New York Mets. He went 13-12 during 
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way he's pitching, I kind of expect him to keep  
pitching,'' Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser is close with Hart and said he would welcome the  
chance to interview for the manager's job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when this part is over, that is something I would be  
interested in,'' Hershiser said in Atlanta Tuesday night before 
Game 6 of the NL series between Atlanta and the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a couple of brief conversations. We agreed it's not  
fair to me to talk about it now. We'll talk when this thing is 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Indians don't consider Hershiser as a managerial  
candidate, they may want to talk to him about being their next 
pitching coach. Phil Regan resigned last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Others thought to be on Cleveland's list include Atlanta hitting  
instructor Don Baylor, New York Yankees coaches Chris Chambliss and 
Willie Randolph, and Indians scout Ted Simmons.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Defenseman Bryan Berard of the Toronto Maple  
Leafs was suspended for two games by the NHL on Tuesday for his hit 
to the head of St. Louis left wing Geoff Courtnall. 
</P>
<P>
	The hit occurred at 18:54 of the second period of last  
Saturday's game. No penalty was called on the play. 
</P>
<P>
	Berard was also ordered to forfeit two games' pay, or  
$17,187.50. The money goes to the Players Emergency Assistance 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The hit ``was unnecessary and inappropriate,'' Colin Campbell,  
the league's director of hockey operations, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Berard, who has played in all eight games this season with two  
assists and seven penalty minutes, must sit out Wednesday night's 
game against Carolina and Saturday's game against Montreal.

<HEADLINE> BoSox Manager Derides Steinbrenner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Red Sox manager Jimy Williams mocked New  
York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner on Monday and denied 
encouraging fans to bombard the field with garbage during the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Georgie Porgie speaks, I don't listen,'' Williams said  
before Game 5 of the AL Championship Series. ``... The calls on the 
field incited it, not me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Steinbrenner had the last word after New York's 6-1 win gave  
the Yankees a 4-1 victory in the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, is that it?'' he asked. ``Maybe he should listen to me  
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Second base umpire Tim Tschida admitted Sunday that he made the  
wrong call in the eighth inning after Chuck Knoblauch tried -- but 
clearly failed, replays showed -- to tag Jose Offerman on his way to 
second. In the ninth, first base umpire Dale Scott also missed a 
call, ruling Nomar Garciaparra out when replays showed he was safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams came out of the dugout and was soon ejected. And that  
brought a hail of garbage onto the field as angry fans took out the 
frustrations of 81 years without a World Series title. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really incited it,'' Steinbrenner said after the game,  
which the Yankees won 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Told of Steinbrenner's comments, Williams said, ``I've never  
worried about Georgie Porgie. He's never been in the trenches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I didn't try to incite it,'' he said. ``I don't like to  
see these things happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox outfielder Darren Lewis acknowledged that Williams'  
tantrum was out of character. 
</P>
<P>
	``But Steinbrenner's statement was sheer madness,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	One umpire had already admitted making a mistake that cost the  
Red Sox a scoring opportunity in the 10th inning of Game 1, which 
the Yankees eventually won 4-3. Williams' complaint then was that 
the umpires didn't ask each other for help. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Williams said he asked Tschida to get help from other  
umpires, but was refused. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than once, I asked for help,'' Williams said. ``And I  
asked in English.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams skipped the postgame news conference Sunday night and  
issued a terse statement reminding everyone that the series wasn't 
over yet. On Monday, he apologized for his absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just didn't want to talk about the umpires any more,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The field was cleared and the game was delayed for eight minutes  
after the second bad call Sunday night. A half hour after the last 
out, fans still crowded around a ballpark television and groaned 
when the replay was shown on the local news. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said he understood the fans' frustration, but he wants  
them to find another way to express it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like those players over there. I don't want to see any of  
them get hurt. I don't want to see any of our guys get hurt,'' he 
said. ``I like our fans, but I was not right. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I didn't incite it. If I really felt I did, I'd accept  
responsibility. But I just couldn't take it anymore. Those calls 
...''

	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- The number 666 is coming up again.  
</P>
<P>
	A movie is in the works about the scandal that resulted from a  
fixed Pennsylvania Lottery drawing of 666 in the Daily Number game

	``It's my understanding that it's going to be sort of a humorous  
look at the lottery or lotteries in general,'' Pennsylvania Lottery 
spokeswoman Sally Danyluk said Monday. ``I don't think we'll ever 
laugh about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fixed drawing paid $3.8 million, a record high at the time,

<HEADLINE> Rabies Test on Bear Is Negative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Additional testing has shown no sign  
that a black bear cub that died suddenly had rabies, an initial 
diagnosis that prompted scores of people to undergo vaccination 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 400 people, some from as far away as Australia, were  
considered at risk because of their contact with the animal, which 
died Aug. 27 at the Wild Midwest Petting Zoo in northwest Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial diagnostic tests at the Iowa State University's  
Veterinary Diagnostics Laboratory came up positive for rabies, 
triggering a worldwide health alert. 
</P>
<P>
	``Granted, it was a false positive,'' Nolan Hartwig, chairman of  
the Department of Veterinary Diagnostic and Production Animal 
Medicine, said Tuesday. ``But it is so much better than if we had a 
false negative, given the number of people that were reportedly 
exposed to that animal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Families had taken their children to play with the 5-month-old  
bear cub named Chief, hugging and kissing the animal, wrestling 
with it and feeding it. 
</P>
<P>
	If the bear's saliva had penetrated the skin through scratches  
or had come into contact with their mouth and nose, those children 
could have been infected. 
</P>
<P>
	Once symptoms develop, rabies is always fatal.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Checks To Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retirees will get the biggest cost-of-living  
increase in their Social Security checks that they've seen in three 
years -- an average $19 a month -- beginning in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2.4 percent benefits boost, announced by the Social Security  
Administration on Tuesday, will be nearly twice the 1.3 percent 
increase senior citizens got this year, largely because of a recent 
spike in energy prices. 
</P>
<P>
	However, with overall inflation remaining relatively tame, the  
2000 Social Security payment update will continue a 1990s trend of 
modest increases. The annual adjustment is tied to the government's 
estimate of increases in consumer prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inflation remains under control, which is important for all  
consumers, particularly seniors who live on fixed incomes,'' said 
Social Security Commissioner Kenneth S. Apfel, focusing on the 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
	Many retirees, however, complain that modest annual payment  
updates in recent years haven't kept up with their day-to-day 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get an increase, but your rent goes up, your gas goes up  
and even your phone bill,'' said Edith Bailey, 79, among those 
interviewed at a senior citizens expo held near Baltimore earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
	David Mullen, 65, of Washington, D.C., searching supermarket  
shelves for bargains on Tuesday, sighed, ``I'll survive, but I 
don't know. I keep playing the numbers and hope I win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 Social Security cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA,  
means the average monthly check for retirees will rise by $19, from 
$785 to $804. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to retirement benefits, Social Security payments  
will increase for disabled workers and families whose breadwinners 
have died. Monthly payments for 6.6 million low-income individuals 
receiving Supplemental Security Income, known as SSI, also will 
rise 2.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The increases will begin showing up in benefit payments for  
January. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately on Tuesday, the government said that the monthly  
Medicare premium deducted from most elderly and disabled Americans' 
Social Security checks for insurance coverage of doctors' office 
visits will stay unchanged at $45.50 in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Monthly checks from Social Security, the government's biggest  
benefit program, with 44.2 million Americans on the rolls, are 
adjusted annually to keep rising prices from eroding recipients' 
buying power. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1975, the adjustment has been automatic, requiring no vote  
by Congress. It is based on changes in the Consumer Price Index -- 
the government's inflation yardstick -- from the third quarter of 
one year to the corresponding quarter of the next. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of low inflation, the yearly benefit boosts have been  
below 3 percent since 1994. The only previous time the automatic 
COLAs had slipped under that level was a record low of 1.3 percent 
set in 1987, which was matched in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 COLA will be the biggest since 2.9 percent in 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, double-digit inflation in the late 1970s drove the  
cost-of-living increase up to a high of 14.3 percent in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for the elderly say that while the smaller COLAs of  
recent years do track standard measures of inflation, they may 
nevertheless seem inadequate to senior citizens, who have special 
purchasing needs. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, while overall prices have been rising at a 2.8  
percent annual rates this year, the cost of medical care -- which 
the elderly use more of -- is rising at a 3.7 percent rate and 
prescription drug prices are climbing at a 6.2 percent rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rising health care costs will offset -- and even erase -- the  
benefit of the COLA for many,'' said Horace Deets, executive 
director of AARP, the nation's largest organization of older 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists argue the opposite: that government statistics  
overstate inflation. As a result, lawmakers have suggested that 
cuts in the COLAs could be part of the solution to a financial 
crisis expected to hit Social Security after baby boomers retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Flo Selkow, 77, said smaller COLAs would be a hardship, but one  
she might be willing to accept if it saved young families from 
higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I depend a good deal on Social Security,'' said the Baltimore  
retiree. ``But if it keeps Social Security solvent, I'd rather see 
them reduce the COLA than anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For 148 million working Americans, the maximum annual earnings  
subject to the 6.2 percent Social Security payroll tax next year 
will rise to $76,200 from $72,600. Thus, the maximum Social 
Security tax paid by workers in 2000 will be $4,724, a figure 
employers are required to match.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton told high school students  
they can be the key to lessening violence in their schools and in 
society at large, and asked for their help in passing new civil 
rights protections for homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence, fear and alienation lead to schoolhouse killings, and  
also represent age-old fears arising from ethnic and religious 
differences, Clinton said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can deal with that, you're going to have the brightest  
future of any generation of Americans,'' Clinton told a group of 
more than 350 young people on Capitol Hill attending a conference 
on violence that was spurred by school killings and stalled gun 
control legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said expanding federal hate crimes legislation to cover  
crimes motivated by sexual orientation is ``very, very important,'' 
and complained that congressional Republicans are trying to block 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want you also to speak up for that,'' Clinton said of the  
gay rights measure. 
</P>
<P>
	One hundred-thirty members of Congress, overwhelmingly  
Democrats, selected up to five student delegates from their 
districts to attend the two-day event that began today. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Reps. Jennifer Dunn of Washington, Sue Kelly of New  
York and Connie Morella of Maryland were the only GOP lawmakers who 
chose to participate, according to Laura Nichols, spokeswoman for 
House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why few Republicans were participating in the youth  
violence conference, John Feehery, spokesman for House Speaker 
Dennis Hastert, said it was a Democratic-sponsored event and ``we 
didn't get invited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conference opens with a greeting from Clinton and Gephardt  
and a showing of ``Fight for Your Rights: Through My Eyes,'' a new 
MTV documentary. A series of workshops on existing programs to 
address youth violence follows, including interactive 
demonstrations of violence prevention methods. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the participants will form small groups to  
identify the top five primary causes of and solutions to youth 
violence. They will present their findings to House and Senate 
leaders on the Capitol steps. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference ends with an Internet broadcast, moderated by  
Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder, of a town hall-style 
discussion with kids in Washington and participating schools around 
the country. Panelists will include William Moffitt, president of 
the National Association of Criminal Defense Attorneys and William 
Modzeleski, director of the Department of Education's Safe and Drug 
Free Schools Program.

<HEADLINE> George Brett Contacted by Indians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- George Brett is getting a lot of  
attention for managerial vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett told The Kansas City Star he was contacted last week by  
former Kansas City Royals teammate Buddy Black, now an assistant to 
Cleveland Indians general manager John Hart. The Indians fired 
manager Mike Hargrove on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The call from Cleveland came about the same time as Brett's  
conversation last week with the Colorado Rockies, who were left 
with a vacancy when Jim Leyland retired and appear likely to hire 
Buddy Bell as a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett, a 1999 Hall of Fame inductee and Kansas City Royals vice  
president, hasn't given details of either conversation and said he 
hasn't discussed the Cleveland possibility with his wife, Leslie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what's going on,'' he said. ``I'm overwhelmed by  
all the attention all of a sudden.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he believes he knows why clubs might be interested in him.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I played, I played hard and I wouldn't tolerate a lack of  
effort,'' he said. ``There is a lack of effort in some places, and 
I think they know I wouldn't tolerate that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indians batting coach Charlie Manuel is considered the leading  
candidate for the Cleveland job. Others mentioned include Davey 
Lopes, Chris Chambliss, Willie Randolph, Don Baylor and Ted 
Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians have said Hargrove's successor need not have  
managerial experience. Brett has none, and realizes he would have 
to rely on experienced coaches on his staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I ever did that, obviously, I'd have to have a lot of  
help,'' he said. ``But whatever city I'd be in, they know I'd give 
it 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett played his entire career with the Royals but has not ruled  
out leaving the club.

<HEADLINE> 11-Year-Old Pleads Guilty to Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- An 11-year-old boy has pleaded guilty to  
participating in the gang rape of an 8-year-old girl in an 
abandoned house. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy pleaded guilty Monday in juvenile court to second-degree  
criminal sexual conduct. He could be sent to a juvenile institution 
until he turns 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other boys, ages 10 and 13, have also been charged in the  
gang rape. They are awaiting competency hearings next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are glad that at least one aspect of the case was resolved  
without having to go to trial,'' said Ramsey County Attorney Susan 
Gaertner. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say seven boys were involved in the September  
attack. Four of them are younger than 10, including the girl's 
9-year-old brother, who is accused of luring the girl into the 
house, raping her and encouraging the others to participate. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Minnesota law, those four boys are too young to be held  
legally responsible for criminal acts.

<HEADLINE> Rockies, Bell Discuss Opening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Colorado Rockies met with Buddy Bell for the  
second day Tuesday and appear close to finalizing a contract that 
would make him the third manager in the team's seven-year team 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, who managed the Detroit Tigers from 1996-98, met with  
Rockies general manager Dan O'Dowd on Monday and Tuesday. He has 
been considered the favorite to succeed Jim Leyland, who retired at 
the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything's going very, very well,'' Bell said Tuesday night.  
``We're just pretty much talking about philosophy more than 
anything. There's still some financial issues, but everything's 
going very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, 48, was scheduled to meet with O'Dowd and the Rockies  
again Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``No deal is final yet,'' O'Dowd said. ``There are still issues  
to be resolved. It's not cut and dried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, who played 18 seasons with four major league teams,  
compiled a 184-277 record as Detroit's manager before being fired 
in September 1998, with three years left on his annual $550,000 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell previously was bench coach for the Cleveland Indians from  
1994-95. He spent this year as the minor league director for the 
Cincinnati Reds, one of his former teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies were reportedly set to introduce Bell as their  
manager Wednesday, but no formal news conference had been scheduled 
as of Tuesday evening, a team spokesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If something going to happen, it's going to happen in the next  
two days,'' O'Dowd said, ``otherwise we're both going to have to go 
in a different direction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going to have to continue with the process. I'm not  
sure what the next step is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One negotiating key was Bell's willingness to move from his home  
in Cincinnati. The Rockies want to avoid a repeat of this summer 
when Leyland lived in the Colorado clubhouse while his family 
stayed in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said Monday he is fond of Cincinnati but ``you have to move  
on sometime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before meeting formally with Bell, O'Dowd held interviews with  
several other candidates, including Arizona Diamondbacks bench 
coach Carlos Tosca, Cincinnati coach Ken Griffey and Florida 
Marlins minor league manager Lynn Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dowd also spoke with New York Yankees coach Willie Randolph by  
phone. Randolph did not travel to Denver because the Yankees are 
playing in the American League playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies began searching for a manager after Leyland retired  
with two years left on a three-year, $6 million deal. Leyland, who 
led Colorado to a disappointing 72-90 record, could remain with the 
team in a lesser role. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta Braves hitting coach Don Baylor managed the Rockies from  
their inception in 1993 until he was fired after the 1998 season.

<HEADLINE> Vitamin E May Lower Cancer Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Smokers who eat a diet rich in vitamin E foods  
may lower their risk of lung cancer by about 20 percent, a new 
study says, but experts stress that the best health advice is still 
to quit smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report published today in the Journal of the National  
Cancer Institute, researchers say a study of more than 29,000 male 
smokers in Finland shows that those with high blood levels of a 
form of vitamin E reduced their risk of lung cancer by 19 percent 
to 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The benefits were most dramatic, the study found, among men  
under age 60 and among light smokers who had been using cigarettes 
for less than 40 years. The reduction in lung cancer risk in these 
groups was from 40 percent to 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the encouraging finding, said Dr. Demetrius Albanes  
of the National Cancer Institute, the most beneficial health action 
smokers can take is still the same: Stop smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to emphasize that not only for lung cancer, but for  
oral cancer, pancreas cancer, kidney cancer and a bunch of other 
cancers, stopping smoking is crucial,'' said Albanes, the senior 
author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, which lasted nearly eight years, researchers took  
periodic blood samples to measure the levels of alpha-tocopherol, 
the most active form of vitamin E in humans. The levels of 
alpha-tocopherol were then linked to health outcomes among the men 
in the study. There were 1,144 cases of lung cancer diagnosed in 
the group during the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The lung cancer rate reduced among men with the highest levels  
of alpha-tocopherol, said Albanes, and the cancer protection was 
most pronounced among men with the shortest history of smoking who 
also had high vitamin E levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the new study involved only smokers and lung cancer,  
earlier studies have shown that healthy levels of vitamin E give 
some protection against heart disease, stroke and some other types 
of cancer, such as prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Albanes said the proven benefits came only from a balanced diet  
that included food rich in vitamin E, he said. The researchers drew 
no conclusions about the effect of vitamin pills taken by some of 
the men in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	In effect, he said the proven benefits of vitamin E come from  
eating the right foods, not from popping vitamin pills. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need more studies to compare supplements with natural diet  
sources of vitamin E,'' he said, adding that there are still 
uncertainties about the comparative value of vitamin pills versus 
nutrients absorbed naturally from foods. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, some studies have shown that beta carotene, an  
antioxidant found in foods such as carrots, can help prevent some 
forms of cancer. Yet, when beta carotene pills were given to the 
group of Finnish smokers, the rate of lung cancer actually 
increased by 16 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Albanes said vitamin E-rich foods include soybean oil and other  
seed oils; nuts, particularly almonds, filberts, hazelnuts and 
walnuts, sunflower seeds and whole grains, including wheat germ.

<HEADLINE> Organization's Letter Boosts McCain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People across the country are receiving  
letters from presidential candidate John McCain, sharing his views 
on wasteful government spending. But his campaign isn't footing the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	A tax-exempt, nonprofit group is mailing McCain's letters as  
part of its own fund-raising efforts. Each comes with a plea to 
send $25 or more to Citizens Against Government Waste. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not uncommon for Congress members to sign such fund-raising  
appeals, which may have mutual benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for McCain, who is one of the Senate's most vocal  
champions of campaign finance reform, said the mailing wasn't 
designed to help his presidential bid. The letter doesn't mention 
that McCain is seeking the Republican nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``He signed the letter and endorsed it because he thinks they  
are a good organization,'' said campaign spokesman Howard Opinsky. 
``We support what they're doing. We certainly didn't see it as 
something done for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A similar mailing by Citizens Against Government Waste in 1996  
prompted investigations by the Federal Election Commission and the 
Internal Revenue Service. In that case, the group shared the 
valuable list of respondents with the candidate who signed the 
letter -- Republican Bob Dole -- sparking allegations that the 
mailing list might constitute an illegal campaign contribution. 
Both the IRS and FEC investigations remain open. 
</P>
<P>
	No names will be shared with McCain's campaign, said CAGW  
President Tom Schatz, although he maintains there was nothing 
improper about the Dole deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Schatz said the McCain letter was planned late last year, before  
the Arizona senator announced he was running for president, and was 
designed only to raise money for the group and help its campaign 
against wasteful spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have nothing to do with his efforts to be elected  
president,'' Schatz said. ``It's totally unrelated in our mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But campaign finance scholar Herbert Alexander said allowing a  
tax-exempt group to pay for letters favorable to McCain raises 
``questions of sensitivity'' at a time when the Senate is debating 
McCain's bill to tighten campaign finance restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``In reality it's not much different from an issue ad on behalf  
of McCain, something he rails against all the time,'' said 
Alexander, professor emeritus at the University of Southern 
California. ``It puts forward his name and it clearly helps in 
terms of lining him up with an issue people who get these letters 
care about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain favors requiring organizations that air political ``issue  
ads'' helpful to individual candidates to make their donor lists 
public. Such a provision was dropped from the bill in hopes of 
winning support for what McCain saw as a more pressing goal -- 
eliminating unregulated ``soft money'' donations to political 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's spokesman said there was no comparison. ``This is an  
organization trying to raise money; this isn't an ad,'' Opinsky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the letters actually could hurt McCain's ability to  
raise money by diluting the impact of his campaign's own 
fund-raising appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has been a member of the nonprofit group's board of  
directors since 1996 and regularly appears at its events decrying 
congressional pork-barrel spending. When the group asked for his 
fund-raising help, arrangements were made through McCain's Senate 
office and cleared by the Senate Ethics Committee, Opinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	The letters began going out in April -- the same month McCain  
informally announced his candidacy -- and continue to be mailed. 
Schatz would not say exactly how many were planned or how much the 
postage cost. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, which does not mention McCain's presidential  
aspirations, briefly describes his military service and 5 1/2 years as 
a prisoner of war in Vietnam. It warns: ``Billions upon billions of 
tax dollars have been spent not to increase defense readiness but 
on low-priority, pork-barrel projects. At a truly shocking rate, we 
are creating what I call a hollow defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The organization mails millions of fund-raising and recruiting  
letters each year, targeted to fiscal conservatives, Schatz said. 
Former Vice President Dan Quayle, former House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich, and House Majority Leader Dick Armey also have signed 
letters for the group, Schatz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Law professor Frances R. Hill, who studies nonprofit groups,  
said such letters raise ``subtle issues -- is the organization kind 
of lending access to its members to the campaign?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hill, a visiting professor at the University of  
Pennsylvania, said simply sending such a letter would be unlikely 
to pique the interest of government regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Candidates remain citizens and members of society, and the  
warm fuzzy feelings they may generate for themselves are incidental 
to the fact that these people are raising money to help the 
charity,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Back to Basics for Michigan State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Now that Michigan State has its first loss, coach Nick Saban  
said he saw signs his Spartans were getting too cocky in building a 
6-0 record and climbing to a No. 5 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chest-pounding is the first indication to me ... you're  
getting a little full of yourself,'' Saban said. ``That's not 
necessary and that's not how you handle things with class; it leads 
to a lack of attention to detail, a lack of fundamentals. ... You 
see yourself as something bigger than you really are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Purdue's Drew Brees threw for 509 yards and five  
touchdowns as the Boilermakers pulled off a 52-28 upset of the 
Spartans, who ruined Ohio State's national title hopes last season 
with an upset of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know everybody gets these images of grandeur when they  
look in the mirror and all of sudden all the things you dreamed 
about when you were a kid are suddenly a reality to you,'' Saban 
continued. ``You look in the mirror and instead of seeing yourself, 
you see John Elway or whoever your idol is at your position. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a big concern of mine that we were falling into that  
trap, that we lost sight of our commitment, that we had to refocus 
and recommit to it, or we were going to have trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next up for the Spartans are No. 17 Wisconsin and Heisman  
hopeful Ron Dayne, averaging 145.7 yards per game.

State under coach John Cooper. ... Ohio State (4-3), which plays a 
12-game schedule, needs seven wins to qualify for a bowl. That

should get to six wins with Iowa and Illinois also on the 
schedule.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Court Revives Tenant Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The nation's largest federal appeals court  
agreed today to reconsider a ruling allowing landlords to refuse to 
rent to unmarried couples for religious reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 last  
January that enforcement of local and state laws against housing 
discrimination based on marital status would violate the religious 
freedom of two Anchorage, Alaska, landlords. 
</P>
<P>
	But the full court said today a majority of its 21 active judges  
had voted to set aside the January ruling and refer the case to an 
11-judge panel for a new hearing, at a date not yet scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	The rehearing had been sought by the state of Alaska and the  
city of Anchorage, with support from attorneys general in six of 
the circuit's eight other states: California, Nevada, Washington, 
Oregon, Montana and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	The January ruling was the first by any federal appeals court on  
the issue of whether property owners' religious beliefs can exempt 
them from housing discrimination laws. The court's conclusion would 
apply equally to laws that forbid housing discrimination based on 
sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Courts of Alaska and California have upheld their  
state discrimination laws against challenges by religious 
landlords. But if the federal appeals court sides with the 
landlords, federal judges throughout the circuit would bar 
enforcement of state laws against any property owner whose sincere 
religious belief forbade renting to unmarried couples. 
</P>
<P>
	In the January ruling, the appeals court panel said the state  
and city discrimination laws unconstitutionally forced the 
landlords to choose between their businesses and their religious 
beliefs. The court also said prohibiting landlords from asking 
about a prospective tenant's marital status violates freedom of 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	States can impose such restrictions on businesses for compelling  
reasons, such as preventing discrimination based on race or sex, 
said the opinion by Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain. But he said 
discrimination on the basis of marital status isn't banned by the 
Constitution, federal law or the laws of many states, and no 
compelling interest has been shown for its elimination.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Policy Goals Said Ambitious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has ``extraordinary  
opportunities'' to promote peace and to project American leadership 
during his last 15 months in office despite severe congressional 
setbacks on foreign aid and arms control, says Sandy Berger, his 
national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders of Israel, the Palestinians and Syria all are  
willing to tackle the ``hard stuff'' and conclude peace accords, 
Berger said Monday in an interview with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said he based this judgment on ``conversations'' the  
United States has had in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's agenda also has at the top securing peace in Northern  
Ireland and cooperating with Russia to deter missile attacks from 
``rogue states,'' Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the task is complicated by a view held by senior  
congressional Republicans that they can lock in U.S. superiority by 
building a wall from the rest of the world and shying away from 
international treaties. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they fail to understand is that in a global world, we can  
only maintain our superiority and strength if we are economically, 
politically and in other ways engaged with the world,'' Berger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Denouncing Congress as miserly for cutting nearly $2 billion  
from the foreign aid bill and for killing the global test ban 
treaty, Berger pledged: ``We will not turn our backs on the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the $12.6 billion in foreign aid voted by Congress in a  
bill Clinton vetoed Monday was ``inadequate for the U.S. to lead 
the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuts in programs to help Russia dispose of nuclear material, in  
aid to poor countries and in peacemaking operations in Kosovo were 
``part of the same pattern of disregard for America's interests in 
the world'' that was reflected in the Senate's rejection last week 
of a treaty to ban nuclear weapons tests, Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, defended both the  
rejection of the test ban treaty and the foreign aid bill. 
</P>
<P>
	They have questioned whether the treaty's monitoring system  
would detect illegal weapons tests by other nations and said the 
United States had to test to keep its nuclear arsenal up to date. 
</P>
<P>
	On foreign aid, Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., said the vetoed  
bill ``enhances America's key international priorities while 
remaining within the confines of a balanced budget agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Callahan, chairman of the House Foreign Operations  
Appropriations subcommittee, promised to ``continue to insist that 
foreign aid programs be subject to the same fiscal discipline 
demanded of domestic spending, and that highest priority be given 
to American taxpayers, not to foreign governments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suggestions that Clinton will be unable to secure a foreign  
policy legacy in his 15 remaining months and that the 
administration was outmaneuvered by Congress rankle the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	The struggle between Clinton and Congress ``is about whether  
America meets its obligations to the world, whether we see our 
stake in the world or turn our backs on the world,'' Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are at a defining moment in many ways,'' the White House  
official said. ``It's about whether the United States is going to 
follow the vision of the last 50 years in taking the lead in 
shaping the world or whether we follow a vision in which we are 
going to build a wall.''

<HEADLINE> U.S., China To Discuss Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese and U.S. negotiators were expected to  
resume talks this week on compensation for NATO's bombing of the 
Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	David Andrews, a U.S. State Department legal adviser leading the  
talks, was due to arrive in Beijing on Tuesday for meetings with 
officials from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, an official 
source said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Andrews' first visit since two days of talks in late  
August ended without a settlement. Andrews' trip, which is expected 
to end Friday, also comes ahead of an expected visit next week by 
U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering, said the source. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews and his Chinese counterparts were expected to resume  
discussions on compensation for damage done to the Chinese Embassy 
by the May 7 bombing, as well as U.S. claims for damage to American 
diplomatic offices in China during violent protests that followed 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has paid $4.5 million to the families of three  
Chinese reporters killed and 27 people injured in the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	China has rejected U.S. explanations that the bombing was a  
mistake and has demanded punishment for those responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombing plunged U.S.-Chinese relations to their lowest point  
in decades. Beijing broke off talks on human rights, security 
issues and Chinese efforts to join the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Angry crowds bombarded the U.S. Embassy in Beijing with chunks  
of concrete, stones and bottles of ink after the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters burned the home of the U.S. consul-general in the  
southwestern city of Chengdu, and consulates in Chengdu and 
Guangdong were damaged.

<HEADLINE>  Mets, Braves Rest After Epic Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The New York Mets have momentum. The Atlanta  
Braves still have the upper hand in the NL Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	With two dramatic victories, the Mets forced the Braves into  
Game 6 tonight at Turner Field and transformed a near sweep of a 
series into a classic-in-the-making. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys are proud to get to this point,'' ailing Mets slugger  
Mike Piazza said after the Mets arrived in Atlanta on Monday. ``But 
it's not getting any easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the Braves are leading the best-of-7 series 3-2 and have  
other factors in their favor: 
</P>
<P>
	--Atlanta is 16-4 against the Mets at 3-year-old Turner Field,  
winning 13 of the last 14 meetings and seven straight -- including 
the first two games of this series. The last two games, if 
necessary, would be at the Ted. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kevin Millwood, who already has two wins and a save in the  
postseason, will pitch Game 6 on five days' rest. New York starter 
Al Leiter, who lost 1-0 on an unearned run in Game 3, will be 
pitching on three days' rest for only the second time in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Mets are hurting. Piazza's left arm and hand, sore and  
bruised, are hampering his swing and caused him to sit out the 
final two innings of Game 5. Outfielder Roger Cedeno is 
questionable because of a bad back that caused him to miss the last 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm little banged up,'' Piazza said. ``But I'm going to go out  
there and give it all I have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leiter, whose only other three-day start came in April 1994,  
said he's ready to give it a try, even if he doesn't have his best 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is 100 percent?'' he asked. ``If you're a major league  
pitcher, there's always times when you don't feel great. You deal 
with it. I have four pitches I can use to get hitters out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither team worked out Monday, choosing to rest after their  
epic 5-hour, 46-minute battle in Game 5 at Shea Stadium. The Mets 
were still relishing their improbable 4-3 victory; the Braves were 
trying to forget. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody is too down, nobody is too up,'' Millwood said Monday.  
``I think everybody is just preparing for tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves were three outs from reaching the World Series for  
the first time since 1996 when Keith Lockhart's two-out, 
run-scoring triple in the top of the 15th broke a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Mets evened the score in their half when rookie Kevin  
McGlinchy walked three batters, including Todd Pratt with the bases 
loaded. Then Robin Ventura sent a drive over the right-field wall 
for an apparent grand slam that became a run-scoring single when he 
was mobbed by his teammates before reaching second base. No matter 
the scoring, it was still a game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
	While New York rocked, the game seemed to awaken Atlanta's  
listless baseball fans. 
</P>
<P>
	There were about 6,000 empty seats for the first two games of  
the series, but a sellout is expected for Game 6. The Braves had 
sold some 9,000 tickets following Sunday's game, leaving only a few 
hundred scattered seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets are just the second team in playoff history to force a  
sixth game after losing the first three games of a series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves were the first, mounting a comeback against San Diego  
in last year's NLCS and seeming -- like the Mets -- to have all the 
momentum on their side following a 7-6 victory in Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	In that game, the Braves won when Padres ace Kevin Brown,  
working in relief, gave up a three-run homer to Michael Tucker in 
the eighth and Greg Maddux pitched the ninth for his first career 
save. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, the Braves returned to Turner Field before a  
raucous crowd and managed just two hits in a 5-0 loss that sent San 
Diego to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can make a bunch of comments about momentum,'' Orel  
Hershiser said. ``But they score three runs in the first inning, 
you'll be wondering, `Where was it?''' 
</P>
<P>
	With a day to recoup, Millwood thinks Game 5 will be a distant  
memory by tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if they were back-to-back (games), without having a  
day off, it would have an effect,'' he said. ``But I think with us 
having today off and being able to go home and get the game out of 
our head a little bit, I don't think it will be that big of an 
effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Leiter, remembering the 1993 World Series, feels the Mets  
will have a huge advantage if they force Game 7. Six years ago, 
Leiter pitched for Toronto when the Blue Jays won the championship 
on Joe Carter's ninth-inning homer in Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always felt if we had lost that Game 6 to the Phillies,''  
Leiter said, ``we wouldn't have felt too good about Game 7.''

<HEADLINE> Farm Bailot May Be Needed Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress will be under political pressure to  
approve another big bailout of the farm economy next year unless 
commodity prices rebound, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture 
Committee said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thought will be, 'Are you going to stand by while farms go  
out of business?' My guess is that the response of Republicans and 
Democrats will be, 'No, we're not going to stand by','' said Sen. 
Richard Lugar, R-Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress sent President Clinton an $8.7 billion package of  
emergency farm assistance last week, the second such bailout in as 
many years. Clinton is expected to sign the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	With the additional aid, direct payments to farmers are expected  
to reach a record $21 billion this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for most crops collapsed two years ago amid the financial  
crises in Asia and Russia and heavy production worldwide. Barring 
major weather problems, economists say grain prices will remain low 
through next year. 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, Lugar's House counterpart, Texas Republican  
Larry Combest, recently announced plans to conduct a comprehensive 
review next year of the GOP-authored 1996 farm law. 
</P>
<P>
	Lugar, speaking to reporters after a speech to commodity groups,  
said he had no plans to hold similar hearings in his committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He would not say whether he would consider any changes to the  
law that the House might propose. ``There's no way I can react 
hypothetically to a bill that might arise, without knowing the 
content and what it is they examined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law, popularly known as ``Freedom to Farm'', ended a  
Depression-era system of production controls and price supports in 
an attempt to wean farmers from their dependence on government 
programs. Farm groups said the law doesn't guarantee them 
sufficient income. 
</P>
<P>
	Lugar said he was opposed to increasing crop subsidies by  
raising the minimum prices that the government guarantees farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you guarantee a certain price, then markets react to that  
by farmers planting more,'' Lugar said. ``If our problem is 
oversupply already, the decision to move those targets upward might 
create more supply.''

<HEADLINE> Parking Scandal Case Said To End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The prosecutor in UCLA's handicapped parking  
scandal expects the case to be wrapped up Wednesday with no-contest 
pleas from the remaining three former Bruins football players 
charged in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect the three to accept the same plea bargain as the  
other 16,'' deputy city attorney Brian Williams said Tuesday. 
``Hopefully, this will send a strong message to others in our 
community that this kind of activity will not be tolerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington Redskins running back Skip Hicks, Kansas City Chiefs  
safety Larry Atkins, and ex-UCLA linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo each 
face a misdemeanor charge of illegally possessing a handicapped 
parking placard. 
</P>
<P>
	They were scheduled for arraignment in Los Angeles Municipal  
Court on Sept. 30, but received continuances until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Demoff, Atkins' lawyer, said at that time it was ``highly  
likely'' his client would enter a no-contest plea. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an unfortunate situation and one that is best  
resolved,'' Demoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16 current or former UCLA players, including Chicago Bears  
quarterback Cade McNown -- a first-team All-American last season -- 
entered their pleas before Municipal Judge Sam Ohta. 
</P>
<P>
	All 16 have been ordered to pay $1,485 in fines and perform 200  
hours of community service, and also must spend a day meeting with 
the disabled and their advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	The city attorney's office brought charges July 8 against 14  
current or former players alleged to be part of the disabled 
parking scam, and five more were charged Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine entered pleas on July 28; four more on Sept. 14, and three  
including McNown on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine are members of the current team and were suspended for the  
season's first two games, as was running back Keith Brown, who 
hasn't been charged and likely won't be, according to Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, we're still evaluating two cases, but I suspect  
that there won't be any additional filings,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams acknowledged Brown was one of the two being  
investigated, but said he couldn't release the other person's name. 
</P>
<P>
	California law allows people with temporary or permanent  
disabilities to obtain permits to park in special handicap spaces, 
to use metered spaces for free and to park in limited-time zones 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	The football players allegedly used the placards to avoid the  
$132 per semester fee for parking on campus and to park in the area 
around UCLA, where parking problems are chronic.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Jump 0.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inflation at the consumer level jumped 0.4  
percent in September, the biggest increase in five months, 
reflecting sharply higher prices for gasoline, cigarettes and 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said last month's increase in the Consumer  
Price Index, the government's most closely watched inflation gauge, 
followed a 0.3 percent rise in August. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, consumer prices have been rising at an annual  
rate of 2.8 percent, sharply higher than the tiny 1.6 percent 
increase in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The faster pace of inflation will mean a bigger cost of living  
increase for the 44.2 million Americans getting Social Security 
checks, who will see their benefits rise by 2.4 percent starting in 
January, nearly double the 1.3 percent increase they received this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But rising worries about inflation have set off alarm bells on  
Wall Street with investors concerned that the Federal Reserve will 
be forced to raise interest rates again at their next meeting on 
Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report today, the Commerce Department said that  
construction on new homes and apartments fell by 3.2 percent in 
September, the second monthly decline, as the impact of rising 
mortgage rates and Hurricane Floyd dampened activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline, which was bigger than had been expected, pushed  
housing construction down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
1.62 million units following a revised 0.5 percent drop in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd was blamed for part of last month's weakness  
with construction starts down 3.2 percent in the South and an even 
bigger 25.7 percent in the Northeast, the two regions affected by 
heavy rains and flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing construction was also off 3.5 percent in the West with  
only the Midwest enjoying an increase in activity last month, a 
gain of 8.2 percent. Mortgage rates have been rising in recent 
weeks with 30-year mortgages averaging 7.82 percent in September, 
more than a full percentage point higher than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	With the September inflation figures matching economists  
expectations, Wall Street chose to focus today on the 
weaker-than-expected housing report. Bond prices initially rallied 
a bit with investors hoping that the slowdown in this key area of 
the economy may convince the Fed that its two earlier rate 
increases are having the desired effect of slowing the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan contributed to investor  
unease last week by warning that banks and other lenders need to 
make sure they are prepared for the possibility of a ``bursting 
bubble'' of stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of last week, stock prices were down by the biggest  
amount in a decade, a slide that was hastened on Friday by the 
government's report that prices at the wholesale level shot up 1.1 
percent in September, the biggest gain in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	The 0.4 percent gain in prices charged consumers at the retail  
level was the biggest increase since a 0.7 percent spurt in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The acceleration in inflation this year has come from energy  
costs, which through September have been rising at an annual rate 
of 16.1 percent, compared to a decline of 8.8 percent for all of 
1998, a year in which the Asian currency crisis cut sharply into 
global demand for crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
	For September, energy prices jumped by 2.7 percent, the third  
straight month of sharp increases. Gasoline prices climbed 2.6 
percent last month while home heating oil shot up 6.2 percent, the 
biggest increase in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Food costs rose a modest 0.2 percent for the third straight  
month as a big drop in fruit prices helped to offset sharp 
increases in the cost of vegetables and beef. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the volatile food and energy sectors, prices were up 0.3  
percent, leaving the so-called core rate of inflation rising at a 
much more moderate 1.9 percent so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the Fed's rate increases point to the absence of  
inflation outside of energy to argue that the central bank does not 
need to be raising borrowing costs to slow down economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The core CPI increase of 0.3 percent would have been an even  
smaller 0.2 percent in September had it not been for a sharp spurt 
in tobacco costs, which were up 6.5 percent. That was the largest 
monthly rise since an 18.5 percent spurt in tobacco costs last 
December. Both big gains reflected the impact of huge court 
settlements in tobacco liability cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Clothing costs, which had fallen for four straight months, were  
also up September, rising by 1.2 percent, as retailers boosted 
prices for fall and winter clothing lines.

<HEADLINE> 88-Year-Old Man Charged in Robbery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- An unarmed 88-year-old man robbed a bank,  
only to be caught by customers as he tried to run away with the 
money, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	J.L. Hunter Roundtree, a homeless man whose last listed address  
was a post office box in Bayou La Batre, Ala., may be the oldest 
bank robbery suspect in the nation's history. An 82-year-old man 
was accused of robbing a Colorado bank in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Roundtree is accused of walking into a NationsBank on Monday and  
giving a teller a note that said, ``Robbery, give me the 
hundreds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clarence Grandison, a customer, said he politely asked Roundtree  
to stop near the door after hearing someone in the bank say, 
``We've been robbed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said Roundtree, carrying a black bag, continued to walk  
out and then started running across the parking lot. Grandison 
chased him and his nephew, Eddie Foster, tackled Roundtree. They 
and another customer held him on the ground until police arrived. 
Roundtree was arrested and charged with bank robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of money Roundtree allegedly took was not disclosed.

<HEADLINE> McDonnell Douglas Corp. Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- McDonnell Douglas Corp. and a Chinese  
government-owned company were indicted Tuesday on charges they 
tried to circumvent U.S. export controls and ship sophisticated 
machine tools to China for use in military production. 
</P>
<P>
	The China National Aero-Technology Import Export Corp., or  
CATIC, was the first Chinese government entity ever charged with 
violating U.S. export controls. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment comes during a sensitive period in U.S.-Chinese  
relations. The FBI is redoing its investigation of alleged Chinese 
nuclear espionage. And while China seeks admission to the World 
Trade Organization, Customs Service agents are conducting several 
major investigations of other potential export violations involving 
China and aerospace equipment, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involved McDonnell Douglas' sale in 1994 of 19 surplus  
machine tools to the Chinese company for $5 million. The U.S 
government licensed the export of the tools only for use in a joint 
Chinese-McDonnell Douglas program to build 40 McDonnell Douglas 
civilian airliners in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the sophisticated machine tools were diverted, in  
violation of license restrictions, to the Nanchang Aircraft Corp., 
where China makes Silkworm cruise missiles and A-5 attack aircraft. 
The diversion was discovered before the tools were misused in 
China, according to U.S. Attorney Wilma Lewis and a 1996 report by 
Congress' General Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Lewis told a news conference, ``this criminal  
conspiracy was a serious attempt to circumvent the export control 
laws designed to protect the national security of the United 
States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Customs Commissioner Bonni Tischler said the charges  
demonstrate that ``firms that sacrifice American security for their 
profit will pay a price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Boeing Co., which acquired McDonnell Douglas in 1997 and was  
not indicted, said that ``McDonnell Douglas did not commit any 
criminal violations in regard to the sale of the machine tools to 
the People's Republic of China and intends to vigorously defend 
against the charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-count indictment also named a McDonnell Douglas division,  
Douglas Aircraft Co., and Robert Hitt, who was director of Douglas' 
China program office. Also indicted were three CATIC affiliates, 
CATIC/Supply, located in Beijing, and CATIC (USA) Inc. and TAL 
Industries Inc., both located in El Monte, Calif., and two Chinese 
citizens employed by CATIC, Hu Boru and Yan Liren. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to conspiracy, the defendants were charged with  
false statements to the U.S. government about the intended use for 
the machine tools that McDonnell Douglas sold CATIC after its 
Columbus, Ohio, plant closed. In Columbus, the tools had been used 
to bend and shape steel for the U.S. B1 bomber and the Peacekeeper 
and Titan missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``U.S. Customs agents, with the assistance of Commerce  
Department investigators, found clear and convincing evidence that 
CATIC and McDonnell Douglas knowingly diverted sensitive technology 
for Chinese military use,'' Customs Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Boeing said, ``Douglas Aircraft Co. ... discovered the  
machine tools were not in the proper location and promptly notified 
the U.S. government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Douglas was ... responsible for retrieving the machine tools  
and making sure they were moved to an appropriate location,'' 
which, Boeing said, ``prevented the possibility of their being used 
for any improper purpose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said, however, that McDonnell Douglas' April 1995 report  
of the diversion came in response to a Commerce Department inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury charged that McDonnell Douglas failed to inform  
U.S. officials that CATIC had initially sought to buy 19 surplus 
machine tools to produce parts for C-17 military transports and 
that the U.S. company had told the Chinese no export licenses could 
be obtained for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment also alleged that CATIC sold some of the machines  
to Nanchang even before the export license application was filed 
listing civilian aircraft production as the end use. McDonnell 
Douglas also failed to tell U.S. officials that Nanchang officials 
had inspected the machines at the Columbus plant and that McDonnell 
Douglas' contract for joint civilian airliner production was in 
jeopardy, the indictment charged. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. House report this year said McDonnell Douglas sought to  
have the six machines left at the unauthorized location, but the 
Commerce Department rejected that. With the approval of the U.S. 
government, the tools have since been consolidated at a factory in 
Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, the companies could face fines of up to $10  
million apiece. The individuals could be imprisoned for up to five 
years and fined up to $250,000.

<HEADLINE> NRA Commercial Angers Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new TV commercial from the National Rifle  
Association has angered some minority lawmakers because of its 
portrayal of blacks and Hispanics in a series of mugshot photos. 
</P>
<P>
	The commercial, which asks Congress not to create new federal  
gun laws until current ones are enforced more aggressively, started 
airing Oct. 11. It shows dozens of mugshots of criminals prosecuted 
in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	While there are many whites in the mugshots, a large percentage  
are minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	One Hispanic lawmaker, Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said he  
thought the portrayal of Hispanics in the commercial was 
``repulsive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of this century, one would think that Americans of  
African-American or Hispanic descent would not longer have to 
tolerate the kind of hate-mongering that this ad encourages,'' said 
Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief NRA lobbyist Jim Baker said critics are ``grasping at  
straws trying to avoid the real message here -- that prosecution on 
federal gun laws have dropped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baker said that he believes that these critics are simply trying  
to avoid that issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is more of a diversion than an honest criticism,'' said  
Baker. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Gonzalez, D-Texas, said that while he disagrees  
with message of the commercial -- asking Congress not to pass new 
gun laws -- the mugshot images were far more disturbing to him as a 
Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there are ways to do it without using the ethnic or  
the racial component,'' said Gonzalez.

<HEADLINE> Hawaiian Super Prix Canceled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- The Hawaiian Super Prix, intended to be the  
richest auto race in history with a $10 million purse, was canceled 
Tuesday after organizers failed to come up with enough money. 
</P>
<P>
	The CART Indy-car event was scheduled for Nov. 13 at Kalaeloa  
Airport, formerly Barbers Point Naval Air Station, with the winner 
receiving $5 million. Qualifying sessions were to be held Nov. 
11-12. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 12 CART circuit drivers and four other drivers were to  
compete. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday was the deadline for organizers to deposit the prize  
money. A $5 million surety bond was issued to CART by Frontier 
Insurance Co. of Nashville in February. 
</P>
<P>
	But Super Prix organizers could not raise the other $5 million  
in prize money or more money to cover operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed to have to make this announcement,''  
Andrew Craig, chairman and chief executive officer of CART, said 
from Detroit. ``However, the Hawaiian Super Prix has been unable to 
secure the necessary funding to make the required payment of the 
purse and other fees to CART.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, the New Hampshire investment bank financing the  
race acknowledged it would lose money but vowed to hold the event, 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	John Halle, president of CNB Capital, didn't return a telephone  
message left Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	When the race was announced in February, organizers expected  
100,000 spectators and a pay-per-view television audience of 300 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	They also said they would stage the event every year for the  
next decade, although the contract with CART was only for three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's going to come off just fine. We've done our  
homework,'' Richard Rutherford, co-founder of Hawaiian Super Prix, 
said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired driving great Mario Andretti came to Hawaii to promote  
the event. 
</P>
<P>
	But the race was hampered by lack of a title sponsor, slow  
ticket sales and a television deal that went from pay-per-view to 
network to Speedvision cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoters tried unsuccessfully to secure a $15 million loan to  
pay for the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of our staff, supporters and sponsors put their  
reputations on the line for the Super Prix and I am very sorry this 
had to happen,'' said Phil Heard, the race's chief operating 
officer and general manager.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Finance Bill Near Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Campaign finance legislation teetered on the  
brink of rejection today as supporters twice fell short of the 60 
votes needed to break a Republican-led filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott sought to usher the measure from the  
floor, and appeared likely to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will persevere,'' vowed Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who has  
made his call for an overhaul of the campaign finance system a 
centerpiece of his bid for the GOP presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the campaign finance bill failed by considerable  
margins to gain the votes they needed to advance their measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The first vote was 52-48, eight shy of the 60 votes needed, on a  
proposal for broad changes similar to a measure the House passed 
earlier in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The second vote was 53-47, seven votes shy. That came on a  
proposal for a slimmed-down measure that included a ban on 
so-called soft money that flows to political parties from unions, 
corporations and individuals in unlimited amounts. McCain and his 
chief Democratic partner on the issue, Sen. Russell Feingold, 
D-Wis., had submitted that second measure for debate in hopes that 
could pick up support from Republicans who opposed the broader 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate cast a 92-1 roll call in opposition to soft money on  
Monday, but that vote was purely symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a defining vote,'' McCain said shortly before the  
Senate went on record 92-1 Monday for a soft-money ban that is at 
the heart of his legislation to curtail the role of big money in 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the principal Senate foe of the  
legislation, said the vote was nothing of the sort. In advance, he 
pronounced the roll call meaningless and successfully urged 
opponents of the campaign finance bill to join with supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., dissented.  
</P>
<P>
	That set the stage for today's two scheduled votes, in which  
supporters will need a majority of 60 to advance beyond a 
filibuster led by McConnell and other Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would ban soft money and allow nonunion members  
to restrict the ability of unions to spend mandatory dues on 
political activities. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain and Feingold stripped the measure of other restrictions  
on campaign money in an attempt to avoid the fate of earlier 
measures, all of which have died at the hands of filibusters. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle also decided to seek a vote  
on the broader bill that McCain and Feingold have supported in past 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Soft money is distinct from so-called hard money, in which the  
size of a donor's contribution is limited. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's vote capped a day of often lively debate in which  
opponents of the legislation renewed their attack on McCain's 
assertion that large soft-money donations are corrupting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who are corrupt will be corrupt regardless of the  
system. And those who are not corrupt will not be corrupt 
regardless of the system,'' said Sen. Robert F. Bennett, R-Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett spiced his argument with an incident from the career of  
his father, who served as a GOP senator for 24 years. Bennett 
recalled sitting in his father's office when a Democratic senator 
handed over an envelope filled with $5,000 in cash as a campaign 
donation. 
</P>
<P>
	Cash contributions were legal then, and Bennett said  
emphatically his father, the late Wallace Bennett, was not corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett also said that as a senator, former President Harry  
Truman placed his wife on the payroll, even though she did no work. 
That was a common practice at the time, he said, as senators 
struggled to make ends meet. But Truman, too, was not corrupt, 
Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Bennett said that by the logic of McCain's argument,  
organized labor should give campaign money to Republicans, the 
better to ``turn them into rabid supporters of the AFL-CIO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organized labor reliably supports Democrats.

<HEADLINE> McClatchy Earnings Up 45 Pct. in 3Q </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The McClatchy Co., which publishes  
newspapers in five states, reported a 45 percent increase in 
third-quarter income Tuesday, crediting higher advertising revenues 
and lower newsprint costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the three months ending Sept. 26 was $20.4  
million or 45 cents a share, up from $14 million or 31 cents a 
share in the third quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $269.3 million, including $216.9 million in  
advertising and $43.3 million from circulation. Overall revenues 
were $263.1 million in the same quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	McClatchy attributed the higher earnings to lower costs for  
newsprint, a 4.9 percent increase in advertising revenues, and 
lower costs for servicing debt. 
</P>
<P>
	McClatchy, headquartered in Sacramento, publishes 11 daily and  
13 non-daily newspapers. The newspapers include the Star Tribune in 
Minneapolis, the Sacramento Bee and the Fresno Bee in California, 
The News &AMP; Observer in Raleigh, N.C., the News Tribune in Tacoma, 
Wash. the Tri-City Herald in Kennewick, Wash., and the Anchorage 
Daily News in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	McClatchy also owns other media-related businesses, including  
Nando Media, a national on-line publishing operation, and The 
Newspaper Network, a national newspaper marketing company. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, McClatchy earned $56  
million, or $1.25 a share, compared to $40 million, or 93 cents a 
share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenues to $801.3 
million from $694.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	McClatchy shares rose 62 1/2 cents to $37.93 3/4 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Wildfire Victims Join Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLA VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- The fire station was the center of  
activity around these parts long before a weekend wildfire swept 
through the area, scorching 26,200 acres and more than 50 homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bridge club meets here, the poker club meets here.  
Everyone has keys to the place and can come in when they need 
anything,'' said Jan Gross, captain of the 15-member volunteer fire 
department in unincorporated Jones Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, instead of coming for leisure, folks are coming to the fire  
station they built for information and moral support, as the 
community attempts to rebuild after the blaze, which caused at 
least $6 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've already had donations: cash, checks and cookies,'' Ms.  
Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 people also helped fight the blaze, which began  
about 4 a.m. Saturday and swept across Shasta County, about 180 
miles north of Sacramento. The fire destroyed at least 58 homes and 
about 220 other structures. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire, fanned by winds gusting to 40 mph, was 95 percent  
contained by today, and firefighters expected to have a complete 
fire line in place around it by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A campfire may have started the blaze, but an investigation is  
continuing, said Henri Brachais, a California Department of 
Forestry spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gross' department was the first to respond to the blaze. It  
gets about $8,000 a year -- most of it from donations -- to protect 
more than 300 homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Ms. Gross said people have volunteered to help rebuild the  
homes that were lost, even if they have to do it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Near the station, Muriel Elliott kept her grocery store open for  
all but a few hours, providing free coffee for firefighters and 
residents. Ms. Elliott said her phone has been ringing constantly 
with calls from worried residents and their friends and families. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately, I've been able to tell people, `Your house is  
just where you left it,''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A few miles south of Jones Valley in Bella Vista, all that was  
left of the Cross Roads Baptist Church was its sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to rebuild bigger and better and keep on doing  
what we do,'' said Pastor Ken Landers, sifting through the pile of 
smoldering ashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Several churches have offered assistance, and one collected more  
than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	If damage estimates hold, the Shasta County fire will be one of  
the season's most destructive blazes, said state forestry spokesman 
Rex Buthmann. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 miles northwest of Sacramento, investigators blamed  
arson for a fire that burned more than 42,000 acres. At least one 
house was burned, and hundreds of firefighters sought to keep it 
from damaging more property. 
</P>
<P>
	In Trinity County, a fire that began two months ago has so far  
burned 117,000 acres. And along the Central Coast, two fires in the 
Los Padres National Forest continued to burn after scorching more 
than 85,000 acres.

	Plane Reported Hijacked in Turkey  
</P>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Hijackers commandeered an Egyptian  
Airlines plane shortly after takeoff from Istanbul's Ataturk 
airport today, the Anatolia news agency said. The agency said the 
plane, which had been destined for Cairo, was diverted to London. 
Private NTV television said one hijacker armed with a knife seized 
control of the plane shortly after it took off. The television 
report said he first demanded to be taken to Hamburg, Germany, then 
ordered the plane diverted to London.

<P>
	POINTE-A-PITRE, Guadeloupe (AP) -- Hurricane Jose, the 10th named  
storm of a relentless hurricane season, was on a collision course 
today with the line of islands that make up the Eastern Caribbean. 
``It's getting stronger, and it looks like it's going to go through 
a lot of islands,'' said Krissy Williams, a meteorologist at the 
U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. Forecasters said it was 
too early to say whether Jose might threaten the U.S. East Coast.

	Panel Wants Puerto Rico Alternative  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite Navy objections, members of a  
presidential panel said today that the service should look harder 
for an alternative to its main Atlantic bombing range on the Puerto 
Rican island of Vieques. At the same time, the chairman of the 
Senate Armed Services Committee said he regretted that the island 
had become so politicized. Francis Rush, the chairman of the 
presidential panel, defended the group's conclusion that bombing 
should be allowed to resume on the island, but at a reduced level -- 
and that the range should be closed entirely within five years.

``put aside their talking points and their attack ads'' when they

	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM, whose name has been synonymous with  
personal computers for nearly two decades, is pulling its 
money-losing line of PCs from retail stores in the United States 
and will sell them exclusively over the Internet, in a drastic move 
to cut costs. IBM, the nation's third-largest PC maker, is the 
latest technology company to get squeezed by intense price wars and 
a surge in component costs. Dell Computer Corp. warned late 
yesterday its third-quarter profits will be hurt by rising memory 
chip prices stemming from the Taiwan earthquake last month.

<HEADLINE> Cleveland Browns Aquire Abdul-Jabbar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Desperate for some help with their running  
game, the Cleveland Browns acquired running back Karim Abdul-Jabbar 
from the Miami Dolphins on Tuesday for a future draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion Browns, who dropped to 0-6 with a loss at  
Jacksonville last Sunday, traded their sixth-round pick in next 
year's draft for Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Browns extend Jabbar's contract before the last day of  
the NFL's 1999 fiscal year -- an undetermined date in February -- the 
Dolphins would also acquire Cleveland's fifth-round pick in the 
2001 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are excited to have Karim join us,'' said Dwight Clark,  
Cleveland's director of football operations. ``He is a good young 
back and will be given the opportunity to contribute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar, 25, started three of Miami's games this season,  
rushing for 95 yards and one touchdown in 28 attempts. He also had 
four receptions for 25 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was benched in favor of rookies Cecil Collins and J.J.  
Johnson and was inactive for Miami's past two games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Karim has done a great job for us in the past,'' Dolphins  
coach-general manager Jimmy Johnson said. ``However, with the 
emergence of our young running backs, playing with the Browns will 
be a good situation for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following a season-high 113-yard performance against the  
Jaguars, Cleveland's rushing offense improved its ranking to 26th 
in the league. But the Browns' inability to run the ball 
consistently has allowed defenses to play close to the line of 
scrimmage and put more pressure on rookie quarterback Tim Couch. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Kirby, primarily a third-down back throughout his career,  
has been the Browns' featured back, with George Jones and recently 
acquired Rashaan Salaam as backups. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby has rushed for 300 yards on 85 carries and one TD through  
six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark said Browns president Carmen Policy personally handled the  
negotiations with Johnson, and was able to finalize the trade 
before Tuesday's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Carmen) shook off the rust, got on the phone directly with  
Jimmy Johnson, and closed the deal for us,'' Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins selected Abdul-Jabbar in the third round of the  
1996 draft out of UCLA. He is ranked second to Larry Csonka (53) in 
Dolphins history with 33 career touchdowns, and his 3,063 yards 
rushing place him fifth on Miami's career list. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar was expected to be in Cleveland on Wednesday  
morning for a physical.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Up 88.65 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks rose Tuesday after a report of  
moderate inflation calmed investors' fears of higher interest 
rates, but their renewed optimism failed to lift technology stocks, 
which slumped following a profit warning from Dell. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 88.65 to close at  
10,204.93, extending its gain of 96.57 on Monday. The index fell 
back from an earlier gain of 219 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
rose 7.19 to 1,261.32, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq 
composite index fell 0.97 to 2,688.18. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks initially soared after the Labor Department said its  
Consumer Price Index, the government's most closely watched 
inflation gauge, jumped 0.4 percent in September. That was the 
biggest increase in five months, but in line with Wall Street 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	A persistent fear that inflation is accelerating has sent stocks  
plunging in recent weeks, driving the Dow 10.7 percent below its 
Aug. 25 record close. Investors fear rising inflation will prompt 
the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the third time this 
year in a bid to slow economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	While the report is unlikely to prevent the Fed from raising  
rates, analysts were heartened by components of the report that 
suggested inflation remains under control. Outside of the volatile 
food and energy sectors, prices were up 0.3 percent, leaving the 
so-called core rate of inflation rising at a much more moderate 1.9 
percent so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock market was looking for any piece of good news,''  
said Robert B. MacIntosh, vice president and portfolio manager at 
Eaton Vance Management in Boston. ``Having a number today that was 
in line with estimates was a major relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also reassured by a Commerce Department report  
that showed construction of new homes and apartments fell by 3.2 
percent in September, the second straight monthly decline. Analysts 
said rising mortgage rates and Hurricane Floyd slowed building 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank and financial stocks benefited from the improved outlook  
for interest rates. American Express rose 2 to 139 7/8 and Bank of 
America gained 3 15/16 to 53 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of strong corporate earnings added to the market's  
gains. Johnson &AMP; Johnson soared 5 1/4 to 99 3/4 after reporting earnings 
that beat analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial and drug sectors also attracted investors in  
search of bargains, said Richard A. Dickson, a technical analyst at 
Scott &AMP; Stringfellow Inc. in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you're seeing is a rebound in some of the stocks that  
have beaten down quite a bit,'' he said. ``There's some substance 
to it, but maybe less than meets the eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks lagged the broader market. Dell fell 2 13/16  
to 38 1/2 after saying late Monday a surge in the price of computer 
memory chips will likely hurt its third-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning from Dell, the nation's largest direct seller of  
computers, fostered fears that many computer makers will face 
similar troubles. Also, Dell's decision to reduce the amount of 
memory it uses in its computers, hoping to cut costs, hammered chip 
makers like Intel, down 4 1/4 to 65 1/8, and Micron Technology, down 5 7/8 
to 62 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickson said Dell's warning, coupled with fears that computer  
sales may slow leading up to the year 2000, rattled the sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``These stocks have priced in a lot of really good times,'' he  
said. ``Now there are some worries being voiced, and they have to 
slip back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The broad market's rise provided a welcoming environment for two  
initial public offerings. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, which 
includes Stewart's media ventures and consumer products, were 
priced at 18, opened at 37 1/4, then edged back to 35 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc. were  
priced at 17, opened at 30 1/2 and closed at 25 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues outnumbered  
decliners by an 8-to-7 margin. Composite volume totaled 1.09 
billion shares, compared with 986.29 million Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.03 to 410.93.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.1 percent.  
Germany's DAX index rose 2.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 2.1 
percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 2.1 percent higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday marked the 12th anniversary of the 1987 market crash,  
when the Dow plunged 508.00 points to 1,738.74. The loss of 22.6 
percent still ranks as the Dow's worst percentage loss.

<HEADLINE> Celtics' Forston May Miss 3 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Boston Celtics forward Danny Fortson has  
a stress fracture in his right foot and will miss 8-to-12 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics announced Fortson's injury in Charlotte during the  
first half of their exhibition against the Hornets on Tuesday 
night. The team said Fortson, hobbling on crutches before the game, 
would return to Boston on Wednesday for further tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a big blow to us, but at least it's not his anterior  
cruciate ligament and it's early in the season,'' Celtics coach 
Rick Pitino said. ``Danny's a tough guy. We cannot hang our heads 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortson, a third-year pro, was acquired in an offseason trade  
with Denver that sent former first-round draft choice Ron Mercer 
from Boston to the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7, 260-pound Fortson started Boston's exhibition  
opener last Wednesday and had eight points and 11 rebounds. He came 
off the bench two nights later against Atlanta, getting a game-high 
12 rebounds in 20 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid CEO Rose and Fell Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Since taking the helm at Rite Aid Corp.  
from his father in 1995, Martin Grass was in a hurry to make Rite 
Aid Corp bigger and better than ever. He bought hundreds of new 
drug stores, went into the business of managing pharmacy-benefit 
plans and courted new business on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But rapid growth came with a heavy price. The company's debt  
mounted and the company struggled to integrate all the new stores 
and operations. This spring, Rite Aid for the first time in years 
failed to meet Wall Street's earnings expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Grass, 45, quit as chairman and chief executive  
officer as the company restated earnings downward by $500 million 
for the past three years. The stock had fallen more than 80 percent 
this year amid the earnings slide. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid stock shot up almost 19 percent Tuesday on the New York  
Stock Exchange, rising $1.81 1/4 to 11.43 3/4 a share. The resignation 
was announced late Monday after markets had closed. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a far cry from the success Grass had earlier in his  
tenure when Rite Aid stock soared by more than 300 percent from 
1995 through the end of the last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass, who had a $1 million salary and commutes to work by  
helicopter from his suburban Baltimore home to Camp Hill, Pa., 
headquarters had lost the trust of the investment community, 
analysts said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's time for a change,'' said Eric Bosshard, an  
industry analyst with Midwest Research in Cleveland. Grass 
``probably tried to do too much too fast ... and really imparted 
some damage on the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy J. Noonan, 57, the company's president and chief  
operating officer, was named as interim CEO. A company spokeswoman 
said Noonan, a 30-year veteran of the company, is in the running to 
become Grass' permanent successor. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very, very ambitious,'' said Marie Griffin, editor in  
chief of Drug Store News, a trade publication based in New York, 
who credits Grass with saving his family's business. ``His success 
rate was very, very high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, it was his ambition to be big that came back to  
bite him,'' Griffin said. ``But there was no way of knowing that'' 
in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Grass' leadership, Rite Aid swallowed up smaller drugstore  
chains to add more than 1,000 stores; bought PCS Health Systems, 
the nation's largest pharmacy-benefits manager; opened hundreds of 
drive-through pharmacies; and courted new business on the Internet 
and from customers looking for alternative medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase of PCS from Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. in January pushed Rite  
Aid's debt from $3.6 billion to more than $5 billion. Delays in 
opening a new distribution center and the cost of an aggressive 
schedule of store openings compounded the financial woes of the 
company, whose earnings have repeatedly fallen short of 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bosshard said he believes the company's prospects are enhanced  
by Grass' departure. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good business,'' he said. ``It's just not been run  
really well here lately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grass has come under criticism for maintaining personal and  
family interests in various suppliers and real-estate interests 
that do business with Rite Aid. He revealed those interests earlier 
this year after The Wall Street Journal investigated claims made in 
a lawsuit by a fired company executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The company that Grass joined in 1978 and took over from his  
father, Alex Grass, in 1995 was a hodge-podge of drugstores that 
lacked a cohesive business strategy, according to Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
	In the marketplace, it suffered from low name recognition;  
internal management of the stores had deteriorated into conflicting 
``fiefdoms'' controlled by the store managers or the pharmacists, 
who did not answer to the managers. It was ripe for a takeover, 
Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The same year that Grass took over, Rite Aid attempted to buy  
Revco, at the time the nation's second-largest drugstore operator, 
but the deal collapsed amid federal antitrust objections. 
Undeterred, Rite Aid acquired the Thrifty PayLess chain for $2.3 
billion in 1996, giving it more than 1,000 additional stores and a 
new Western territory. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company had trouble making money from the stores in the  
West because they were bigger than Rite Aid was used to.

<HEADLINE> Number of SUVs on Road Has Doubled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of sport utility vehicles on the  
road has doubled in five years, the Census Bureau said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Registrations for SUVs increased 93 percent between 1992 and  
1997, and SUV registrations have more than tripled in the decade 
since 1987, the bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings are consistent with auto sales reports that show  
light truck sales are approaching half the U.S. market. The other 
half is car sales. 
</P>
<P>
	SUVs are coming on fast, with about 18 percent of market sales  
this year -- nearly the same as pickup trucks, traditionally the 
dominant section of the light truck market, according to data from 
Ward's Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	The census survey estimated 13.8 million SUVs in the United  
States in 1997, or about 19 percent of registered trucks, up from 
7.1 million in 1992, or about 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of minivan registrations increased by about 61  
percent to 9.8 million during the same period while pickup trucks 
increased about 8 percent about 36 million, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, there is one SUV for every 13 licensed drivers, the  
bureau said. Colorado had the most SUVS, with one for every seven 
licensed drivers.

<HEADLINE> Drug Co. Studies Said Less Critical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Studies on the cost-effectiveness of drugs are  
far more likely to report favorable findings if they are sponsored 
by the drug companies themselves rather than independent groups, 
researchers found. 
</P>
<P>
	Their study -- funded by a pharmaceutical company -- appears to  
confirm long-held suspicions that doctors are less critical about a 
drug's safety and effectiveness when they have financial ties to 
the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is possible that these factors may result in some  
unconscious bias'' in interpreting a study's findings, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the conflict-of-interest issue made headlines when a  
report found that the vast majority of doctors who defended the 
safety of calcium channel blockers had a financial relationship 
with manufacturers of the blood pressure pills. 
</P>
<P>
	In the current study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the  
American Medical Association, the researchers looked at 44 studies 
on the cost-effectiveness of cancer drugs. Twenty of the studies 
were funded by pharmaceutical companies and 24 by nonprofit 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Those sponsored by nonprofit groups reached unfavorable  
conclusions 38 percent of the time, compared with just 5 percent 
for studies sponsored by pharmaceutical companies. Also, 
researchers in company-backed studies were slightly more likely to 
overstate the cost-effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Some researchers receive funding directly from pharmaceutical  
companies. Some get funding in the form of honoraria or travel 
expenses. Some hold stock in drug companies and profit directly 
from increased drug sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Charles Bennett, the lead author and a professor at  
Northwestern Medical School, said that in addition to the 
possibility of unconscious bias, there could be other explanations 
for the findings. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, pharmaceutical companies are given early looks at  
studies. That enables them to abandon studies that appear to be 
unfavorable and focus on those they think are going to be positive, 
Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said the findings should not be seen as a major  
criticism of pharmaceutical companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our study was sponsored by a pharmaceutical company,'' he  
said, adding that the company, Amgen Inc., did not comment on it 
before publication. He also said his paper analyzed studies 
sponsored by Amgen, which fared no better than other 
company-sponsored studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said the best thing would not be to stop pharmaceutical  
companies from sponsoring research, but to get other types of 
sponsors to underwrite studies, too, such as managed care 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Amgen spokesman David Kaye said: ``If you want the best  
physicians in the world, you have to let them run the trials. If 
you kill a study or over control it, word gets out and the best 
investigators won't do your studies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others not involved with the study said the findings raise  
serious concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best hypothesis I can tell for that is the person doing  
the research has internalized the values of their funder,'' said 
Sheldon Krimsky, a Tufts University professor who studies 
scientific integrity and conflict of interest and who wrote an 
editorial about the study in JAMA. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health Research  
Group in Washington, agreed: ``As in other studies of the drug 
industry, this shows the financial interests of the drug industry 
rides over the actual data.''

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid CEO Steps Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP HILL, Pa. (AP) -- Rite Aid Corp.'s shares shot up 18 percent  
this morning as it shopped for a new chairman and chief executive 
to nurse the nation's third-largest drug store chain back to 
health. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin L. Grass, whose father founded the company more than 40  
years ago, resigned Monday amid a company struggle to overcome a 
mountain of debt accumulated through rapid expansion in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass, who took over the company in 1995, has also faced  
questions that he held stakes in several suppliers and real estate 
interests that do business with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid's stock has slipped more than 80 percent this year, as  
the company has repeatedly had to restate downward its previous 
years' earnings. It rose $1.75 to $11.37 1/2 a share this morning on 
the New York Stock Exchange in the first trading since the 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy J. Noonan, the company's president and chief operating  
officer, was appointed interim chief executive officer while the 
search for a permanent successor to Grass continues. 
</P>
<P>
	Noonan, a 30-year Rite aid veteran, said the willingness of the  
company's agent banks to extend its line of credit for one year and 
the commitment of a $300 million infusion from investment banking 
firm Leonard Green &AMP; Partners will provide ``a firm financial 
base'' for Rite Aid's future plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident that all our constituencies -- shareholders,  
vendors, management, pharmacists and associates -- should find 
reassurance in today's announcement'' said Noonan, 57, in a 
statement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass, 45, who also is giving up his position as a Rite Aid  
director, led the company through a major acquisition campaign in 
recent years but has acknowledged in recent months that it was 
overly ambitious. 
</P>
<P>
	To slash its nearly $5.1 billion in debt, Rite Aid is trying to  
sell dozens of its West Coast stores and has signaled a willingness 
to sell at least part of its interest in pharmacy-benefits manager 
PCS Health Systems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's announcement came a week after the Camp Hill-based  
company reported a second-quarter loss of $67.9 million, which it 
blamed on costs associated with closing stores and acquiring PCS. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid closed or moved 106 stores during the quarter. Also  
hurting the results was a $49 million increase in interest costs 
related to financing for the January acquisition of PCS, the 
retailer said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also announced its restated financial results for the past  
three fiscal years will result in about $500 million drop in prior 
years' earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid, which ranks third in sales behind Walgreen and CVS,  
operates about 3,900 stores in 30 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Grass took Rite Aid's reins from his dad, Alex, in 1995.  
A year later the company bought Thrifty PayLess (with more than 
1,000 stores) for about $2.3 billion. The deal took the company 
into new western territory. 
</P>
<P>
	In late 1998 Rite Aid bought competitor PCS Health Systems, a  
giant pharmacy benefits manager, from drugmaker Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. for 
$1.5 billion. But Rite Aid recently said it was exploring selling 
PCS in part to pay back its debts. 
</P>
<P>
	After revising three years of earnings, in June, Rite Aid  
announced that its CFO, Frank Bergonzi, will retire before year's 
end.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Parents Sue Each Other </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The same intense emotions that brought  
people together in a sea of silver and blue to mourn Columbine High 
School's dead are now tearing them apart. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 18 lawsuits are in the works as a result of the April  
20 bloodbath, with just about everyone a potential defendant -- gun 
makers, the gunmen's parents, the school district and the sheriff's 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the parents of one of the killers, Dylan Klebold, have  
filed a notice of intent to sue Sheriff John Stone. The Klebolds 
say Stone failed to inform them about the violent tendencies of the 
other gunman, Eric Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were aware that Harris had made threats and  
maintained a hate-filled Web site, and the Klebolds claim they 
would have made sure their son stayed away from Harris if they had 
known that. 
</P>
<P>
	The Klebolds' lawyer, Gary Lozow, said Thomas and Susan Klebold  
want to protect themselves from lawsuits filed by victims and will 
not seek more money that what other people are seeking from them. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold stormed their high school just after  
lunchtime, scattering gunfire and bombs. They killed 12 students 
and a teacher and wounded at least 23 others before committing 
suicide in the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	In the days after the massacre, Littleton came together, putting  
up silver-and-blue Columbine ribbons in windows and on fences and 
wearing lapel pins. They turned out for funeral services, organized 
campaigns to raise money, and made dinners and did other chores for 
victims' families. 
</P>
<P>
	Harriet Hall, the mental health worker in charge of providing  
counseling to the Columbine victims, said she is not surprised how 
much the community has clashed since then. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be worried if there weren't disagreements. I think it is  
possible to have nobility, anger and grief at the same time, if you 
recognize your grief, but it is rare indeed,'' Ms. Hall said. 
``This is a natural response to what the community has been 
through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The parents of Isaiah Shoels, the only black student killed in  
the massacre, are suing the Harrises and the Klebolds, in addition 
to two men charged with helping the teens get the guns used in the 
attack. The lawsuit alleges the parents failed to take action when 
their sons stockpiled guns and bombs, and gave them ``extraordinary 
privileges'' despite their run-ins with the law. 
</P>
<P>
	They do agree with the Klebolds on one thing -- they also have  
filed notice of intent to sue the sheriff's department. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Riddle, a spokesman for the Shoels family, said ``the  
Shoelses caught all kinds of hell when they filed their lawsuit,'' 
yet ``now these other families are following'' them. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado law requires anyone who wants to sue a government  
agency to file notice of intent to do so within six months of an 
incident. In this case, that deadline expired this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Colorado law, the families cannot collect more than  
$600,000 in a lawsuit against a government agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Several parents who filed notice said they are not motivated by  
money and will decide whether to pursue their lawsuits after the 
official investigation is complete. They said they want to know 
whether the massacre could have been prevented. 
</P>
<P>
	One likely case would come against school officials. Some  
parents claim school officials ignored how certain cliques at 
Columbine hassled less popular students like Harris and Klebold. 
Other cases might claim that school security was inadequate or that 
administrators didn't do enough to prevent the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the lawyers who have filed these notices review the  
cases and realize that there is no legal liability on behalf of the 
county, sheriff or any other county employees that have been 
named,'' said Bill Tuthill, an attorney for Jefferson County. 
</P>
<P>
	There is support for the Klebolds' case, even in some unlikely  
corners. Brian Rohrbaugh, whose son, Dan, was among the slain 
students, said he could understand why the Klebolds sued. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, if the sheriff's department had done what would have  
been expected of them,'' Rohrbaugh said, ``I think everything that 
happened April 20 would have been avoided.''

<HEADLINE> Pregnant Venus Statue Rouses Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Pregnant, naked, hair in dreadlocks and sporting  
a sparkling nose stud, The Picardo Venus has spawned a fierce 
public art debate in the city's oldest and largest community 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
	In the three months since it appeared beside a new children's  
play area, the 2 1/4-foot bronze figure has been covered repeatedly 
with garbage bags and a removal campaign has split a once-tranquil 
gardening group. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fear vandalism could be next.  
</P>
<P>
	The statue squats on oversized haunches, hands crossed over an  
enormous belly, eyes closed in a beatific expression. Nestled in 
her dreadlocks are fish, seashells, a dragonfly, a tree frog and 
symbols representing the sun and moon. The podium bears ancient 
symbols of feminine power and fertility. 
</P>
<P>
	``It strikes me as ugly. It reminds me more of a frog,'' said  
Doug Ward, a garden block leader. ``To me, art is supposed to evoke 
all these good feelings, and it's certainly not Venus de Milo or 
Winged Victory of Samothrace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephanie Butow, a gardener, said the statue should be removed  
to a safe place pending a survey of all 281 gardeners. 
</P>
<P>
	``No woman looks like that. If it was going to be a naked,  
pregnant woman, I wouldn't care -- I mean, I'm a mother, it doesn't 
bother me -- just make her look normal,'' Butow said. ``But those 
huge breasts -- why do we need that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She's glorifying fertility a little too much for kids, isn't  
she?'' said Gloria Seborg, another gardener. ``I mean, we don't 
want a bunch of pregnant kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Picardo p-patch was established in 1973 on the last 2 1/2 acres  
of what once was a 20-acre Italian family truck farm about three 
miles north of the University of Washington (the p in p-patch 
honors the family). It is where the city's community gardening 
program originated. The program was cited as a national model at 
the American Community Gardening Association convention here in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Venus was purchased with $6,300 from a $10,000 city grant that  
also provided an 8-inch-high decorated retaining wall, wooden 
picnic table, sandbox, swing set and cedar lawn swing for the 
patch. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposals, drawings and models were submitted and discussed,  
artist Steve Anderson's design was selected, and the model was 
approved at the Picardo annual gardeners' meeting last April. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after the installation and dedication on Aug. 8, though,  
some of the gardeners were grousing. Someone began anonymously 
covering Venus with garbage sacks several times a week. 
</P>
<P>
	A campaign to remove the figure was mounted by Jack Leversee, a  
block leader and retired family practice doctor who claimed there 
had been inadequate notice of the project, selection process and 
design choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, 31, said the design for his first public commission  
originated with a fist-sized carving he made seven years ago as a 
tribute to his mother. Venus was the Roman goddess of love and 
beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was making her, I grabbed every one of my female  
friends and every woman walking by my shop and asked what they 
thought of it,'' Anderson said. ``I got such a positive response, I 
don't really know what the fuss is about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About two dozen gardeners met beside the small statue Saturday  
to discuss the issue with Rich Macdonald, head of the city p-patch 
program, and other officials amid the aromas of late-ripening 
tomatoes, pumpkins, beets and raspberries. 
</P>
<P>
	After an hour of debate, they formed a task force to survey all  
281 p-patch renters and try to decide the statue's fate before the 
annual gardeners' meeting in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most opponents, Ward said he was content to leave it in  
place while the task force tackles the issue. No one wanted to see 
it vandalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``I personally don't like it, but I think it would be a shame if  
somebody came down and destroyed it,'' Ward said.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Jury Acquits Widow of Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FERNANDO, Calif. (AP) -- A widow hugged her lawyer and burst  
into tears after being acquitted of charges that she beat her 
husband to death with a baseball bat to collect $400,000 in 
insurance money. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeanie Adair, 39, was found innocent Monday by a Superior Court  
jury that deliberated 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still miss my husband,'' Adair said outside the courtroom.  
``I don't feel I can really celebrate. The people who did this to 
my husband are still out there, and not until they are behind bars 
and charged with his murder will I be happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Margarita Ruffino-Sutcliffe, the mother of victim Robert Adair,  
called the trial a ``mockery of justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know in my heart she killed my son,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Adair was arrested two years after the Nov. 5, 1996 and  
charged with first-degree murder with special circumstances of 
lying in wait and murder for financial gain. If convicted, she 
would have faced a possible sentence of life in prison without 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities alleged she staged a crime scene to back her story  
that a man posing as a gas company worker forced his way into her 
Sylmar condominium, bound and beat her and looted the home before 
killing Adair when he returned home for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution argued that Ms. Adair gave inconsistent accounts  
of the attack to friends and police, and that she made three 
telephone calls during the time she supposedly was gagged and 
hog-tied. 
</P>
<P>
	But a cable television company worker testified about seeing a  
man in an outdated gas company uniform at the Adair condominium 
complex the day of the killing.

<HEADLINE> Goodman Commits To Play at Towson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Tamir Goodman, an Orthodox Jew who turned down  
a basketball scholarship to the University of Maryland, is prepared 
to make an oral commitment to Towson University. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to Towson, provided all the details can be worked  
out,'' Harold Katz, who coached Goodman for years and remains a 
close friend, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman expected to play for Maryland but turned down the offer  
last month after meeting with Terrapins coach Gary Williams. 
Goodman, 17, said he rejected the scholarship after it became 
apparent the coaching staff was uncomfortable with his refusal to 
play on Saturdays, the Jewish Sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman, who is part of a very tight family, did not want to  
attend college far from his Maryland home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He picked Maryland because it was close to home. He still  
wants to stay home, so he went with Towson,'' Katz said. ``If 
things go as planned, he will sign a letter of intent in 
November.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Towson officials refused comment Tuesday, citing NCAA rules that  
prohibit a school from talking about prospective student-athletes 
until they sign a national letter of intent. 
</P>
<P>
	The level of competition Goodman would face at Towson isn't as  
daunting as what he would have encountered at Maryland, a member of 
the highly competitive Atlantic Coast Conference. Towson plays in 
the America East. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3, 159-pound Goodman averaged 35.4 points a game last  
year for the Talmudical Academy, a Jewish day school near Baltimore 
that has an enrollment of only 72 students. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman transferred to Takoma Academy, a Seventh-day Adventist  
school in Takoma Park, for his senior year.

<HEADLINE> Ryan White Foundation To Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) --The Ryan White Foundation, which bears the  
name of one America's earliest and youngest public faces of AIDS, 
is closing because of dwindling donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeanne White-Ginder, White's mother, said she will close the  
organization and join forces with another advocacy group, AIDS 
Action, at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't be up to me to bring in all the money now,'' she said  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	White-Ginder will lead the Washington-based group's Ryan White  
Project, a new effort to bolster AIDS education among young people 
and to lobby for continued federal funding for AIDS programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are combining our efforts to make sure that Ryan's legacy  
continues,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	White, a hemophiliac, contracted the virus through tainted  
blood-clotting products. His court battle to be allowed to attend 
school drew widespread attention. Celebrities such as Michael 
Jackson and Elton John befriended him and he was the subject of a 
television movie.

	He died in 1990 at age 18. Later that year, White-Ginder started  
the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	At its height, the Indianapolis-based organization had four paid  
employees and an annual budget of about $250,000. But dwindling 
donations forced the layoff of full-time staff this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Its leaders attributed the drop in funds to beliefs that the  
AIDS crisis is over. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, ``the AIDS epidemic is in the midst of one of its worst  
crises yet -- the crisis of complacency,'' said Mark Maddox, the 
foundation's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug advances have prolonged the life of many AIDS patients, but  
the rate of new AIDS infections has remained constant at about 
40,000 a year for the past decade. About half of new infections are 
believed to be among Americans under 25, according to the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Pledges Peace With Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura has pledged to make a  
chilly peace now with the media -- and to wage war later down the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was elected here to do the state's business and not my  
personal war. So I will hold off on my personal war,'' Ventura 
said. ``But when I'm through with this job, I will resume my 
personal war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura's comments appear in the Oct. 25 issue of Newsweek  
magazine, a few weeks after the publication of a controversial 
Playboy interview in which he discussed sexual assault, religion 
and fat people, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to offer my personal opinions on anything,''  
Ventura told Newsweek. ``I've been manipulated by the media for 
their own ends, and I'm not going to let it happen any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura told the magazine he would discuss only his  
administration's policies from now on. In the past the governor has 
vowed to quit joking on TV, and has pledged a moratorium on most 
national media interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad, because I get four or five people who come up to me  
on a daily basis and say, 'Governor, don't change. Be who you've 
got to be.' But in light of my family and self-preservation, I know 
that I have to change,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can be yourself and get elected, but you can't be yourself  
and govern. You have to give the correct answers. You have to give 
the answers that don't offend anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura also told Newsweek he might leave the Reform Party if  
conservative Republican Pat Buchanan became the Reform Party 
presidential nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a petition to recall Ventura was dismissed Monday by  
Minnesota's chief justice, who said the ex-wrestler didn't do 
anything wrong by making money off a book deal and public 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall petition -- the first in the state since it became  
legal in 1996 -- was filed by environmentalist Leslie Davis, an 
unsuccessful write-in candidate for governor last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis claimed Ventura committed malfeasance by using the  
prestige of his office to secure a better book deal and a higher 
price for his return to the wrestling ring; and by taking gifts and 
favors from his book publisher and wrestling promoter. 
</P>
<P>
	Supreme Court Chief Justice Kathleen Blatz said the allegations  
did not constitute grounds for a recall. She ruled that the 
governor's actions either were not within his official duties, or 
they were not illegal or wrongful.

<HEADLINE> South Poll Doctor Has Breast Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The doctor who was rescued from the South Pole  
nearly five months after finding a lump in her breast confirmed 
Tuesday that she has breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jerri Nielsen, 47, was rescued Saturday from the  
Amundsen-Scott South Pole Research Center, where she had been 
treating herself with chemotherapy while serving as the station's 
only doctor. She returned to the United States on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from the National Science Foundation confirmed that  
she has cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to be back with my family and friends in the United  
States. My spirit is strong,'' Nielsen said in the statement. She 
refused to reveal where she was undergoing treatment and said she 
would not grant any interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen, a divorced mother of three from the Youngstown area,  
had been treating herself in Antarctica with medical supplies 
dropped to her during a daring mission in July -- the middle of 
winter, when it was impossible for a plane to land there. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplies allowed her to perform her own biopsy and begin  
administering chemotherapy. She e-mailed photographs of slide 
samples of the tumor to doctors in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen's rescue from the coldest place on Earth was possible  
only after the Antarctic winter relented slightly, making it warm 
enough -- 58 degrees below zero -- to risk the flight. Officials said 
the rescue operation was possibly the earliest post-winter flight 
to the South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
	In the statement, Nielsen thanked her colleagues and everybody  
who helped her. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heartfelt thanks go out to my South Pole friends,  
colleagues and the general public for their encouragement and best 
wishes during my ordeal,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP Set To Meet on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House set a combative tone for  
budget talks with Republicans, telling GOP congressional leaders to 
``put aside their talking points and their attack ads'' when they 
meet with President Clinton this evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, meanwhile, said they would put Clinton on notice  
that they will not raise taxes or use Social Security surpluses to 
pay for extra spending the president wants. 
</P>
<P>
	But with neither party ready to go to the brink, Congress voted  
today to keep federal agencies open through Oct. 29 while the two 
sides work on their budget dispute. The first such extension will 
expire Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved the measure by 421-2, with only Reps. Ron  
Paul, R-Texas, and Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., voting no. The Senate 
approved it by voice vote and sent it to Clinton for his expected 
signature. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton hoped to  
reach a ``framework'' for a wider budget agreement but ``has no 
particular mechanism in mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides are meeting nearly three weeks into the new fiscal  
year with only five of the 13 annual spending bills approved. Five 
others have either been vetoed or face veto threats over issues 
including hiring teachers and police officers and blocking tougher 
environmental requirements for some oil and mining companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president hopes to find a way to get to agreement where we  
can maintain our fiscal discipline and our priorities,'' Lockhart 
told reporters. ``I think he hopes Republicans can put aside their 
talking points and their attack ads, come down and be honest and 
straightforward and work through these problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to reach out a hand of friendship and hope that  
we can work together,'' Clinton said Monday night in Newark, N.J., 
where he attended a Democratic fund-raising event. 
</P>
<P>
	That hand is being extended as relations between the White House  
and Congress, already soured by Clinton's impeachment trial, have 
worsened. Last week's Senate rejection of the nuclear test ban 
treaty, a top administration foreign policy goal, has sparked 
bitter accusations of partisanship from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand about public discourse in this town. Sometimes it  
gets colorful,'' acknowledged Armey, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget  
office, the White House says even without meeting all of Clinton's 
budget demands, GOP spending plans would spend billions in Social 
Security surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's budget wouldn't spend the Social Security  
surplus,'' said White House budget director Jack Lew. ``Congress 
has said they want to do the same thing. We don't believe they 
have. We need to work out our differences in a fiscally responsible 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed paying for additional spending by raising  
tobacco taxes, levies charged industry to cover toxic waste 
cleanups and other revenues -- proposals Republicans have turned 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their differences, the two sides' differences pale  
compared with the clashes of 1995 and 1996, when GOP efforts to 
abolish entire agencies like the Education Department helped prompt 
two federal shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the five bills in the center of this year's spending fight,  
Clinton wants less than $10 billion over what Republicans have 
offered, a tiny portion of the nearly $600 billion that the annual 
spending bills control. 
</P>
<P>
	And in recent weeks, Republicans have added billions of dollars  
to move closer to Clinton's proposals. Those bills cover the 
departments of Interior, Commerce, Justice, State, Labor, 
Education, Health and Human Services, and foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	But the two sides have philosophical differences, such as how  
extensive state control over federal education aid should be. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Clinton vetoed a $12.7 billion foreign aid bill that  
fell $2 billion below his request. It omitted any of the $500 
million he wants for Israel and the Palestinians to implement the 
accord they struck last year at Wye River, Md. It also provided 
less than he wanted for international debt relief and efforts to 
reduce the nuclear threat from Russia, North Korea and other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Though both sides stood to gain by holding a meeting that would  
let them appear reasonable, it was unclear what the session would 
achieve. There were some hopes on both sides that it would lead to 
a series of lower-level meetings where remaining differences could 
be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, House and Senate Republicans agreed Monday to a  
compromise $37 billion measure financing the Commerce, Justice and 
State departments. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans added about $1.5 billion to it, but Democrats said  
Clinton would probably veto it anyway. It still contains about $2 
billion less than he wants, including less than half his $1.3 
billion request for hiring local police officers.

<HEADLINE> Encyclopaedia Britannica Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Encyclopaedia Britannica, the longtime leader in  
information that has lost its way in the Internet era, is giving 
away its knowledge for free in a desperate bid to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	As of today, the publisher's 32-volume set is available to  
anyone who surfs the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The only catch: You have to wade through advertisements --  
Britannica's source of revenue for the risky move -- to get your 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire Britannica -- from a-ak (an ancient East Asian music)  
to Zoroastrianism (a Persian religion) -- can be found at the 
Chicago company's retooled site, www.britannica.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to emulate the success of Amazon, Yahoo and others, the  
site also offers current information from newspapers, news agencies 
and 70 magazines as well as community services such as e-mail, 
weather forecasts and financial market reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the new company, split off by the publishing company  
to house its digital properties, Britannica.com Inc., tried to put 
the best spin on the venture, calling this ``a momentous day for 
knowledge seekers everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Purchasing the Encyclopaedia Britannica was once a major  
milestone in a family's life, but today we are fulfilling our 
promise to make it more accessible to more people worldwide,'' said 
Don Yannias, the new company's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	But giving up its prime asset for free -- bound volumes still go  
for about $1,250 a set -- shows the straits into which the 
231-year-old company has fallen. 
</P>
<P>
	Encyclopaedia Britannica had revenue of $650 million and a sales  
force of 2,300 at its peak in 1989. Revenue estimates are no longer 
available from the privately held company, where the work force is 
thought to number about 350. 
</P>
<P>
	The company lost ground badly when Microsoft Corp., after being  
spurned by Britannica, teamed with discount-market encyclopedia 
publisher Funk &AMP; Wagnalls to produce a colorful, multimedia 
encyclopedia on CD-ROM in 1993. Britannica's own CD-ROM version, 
released a year later, was low on graphics and did not fare well. 
</P>
<P>
	It also became the first encyclopedia available on the Web in  
1994, but the reception was muted by the $85-a-year subscription 
fee. 
</P>
<P>
	House calls by salesmen, once a company trademark, were dropped  
in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Tuesday's Golf Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Rivals on the golf course and in golf course design, the  
friendly competition between Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer will 
subside for something really unusual -- a partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer and Nicklaus are collaborating on a new golf course for  
the World Golf Village that will be called ``The King and The 
Bear,'' scheduled to open in the fall of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	What will it look like? Right now, that could be anyone's guess.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were very similar in that we both have two arms and two  
legs,'' Palmer cracked Monday during their second joint visit to 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, of course, played a low, hard draw. Nicklaus was  
renowned for his high fade. 
</P>
<P>
	``My side of the green is going to be flat so you can come in on  
the ground level,'' Palmer said. ``Jack's side will be elevated so 
you have to hit the high shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it's more than just Palmer and Nicklaus. Both their  
design teams are involved in the $5 million project, although 
Nicklaus tends to a be a little more hands-on. Palmer's people 
worked on the routing, while Nicklaus, a stickler for details, is 
working on the strategy of the course. 
</P>
<P>
	The course will complement the Slammer and the Squire, designed  
by Bobby Weed with input from Sam Snead and Gene Sarazen, and could 
be host of a future Senior Tour event. 
</P>
<P>
	While Nicklaus and Palmer have courses in the same resort, they  
have never worked on a course together. Both said the sole reason 
they are collaborating is to bring more attention to the World Golf 
Village, home of the new Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``Would we both do this at another place? No,'' Nicklaus said.  
``But because it's the Hall of Fame, and because it's good for the 
game of golf, that's why it means so much for the two of us to be 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even walking over two holes in mud left over from Hurricane  
Irene, the two camps did not agree on everything. Nicklaus said 
that's part of the give and take. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack has stronger opinions on some things, but generally we  
agree,'' Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he had to make any concessions, Nicklaus looked over  
his shoulder on what will be the 17th green and said, ``Yeah. Right 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've played a million golf courses. Arnold has played a  
million golf courses,'' Nicklaus said. ``We ought to be able to 
figure out what we both like in a green. It's no big deal. I can 
have that green 50 ways, and he can, too. As long as we agree on 
one of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MONTY'S QUEST:* Scotland may be the unofficial birthplace of  
golf, but it has been host to only one Ryder Cup, at Muirfield in 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Colin Montgomerie wants to change that.  
</P>
<P>
	Europe's top player is backing a bid for Turnberry to hold the  
Ryder Cup in 2009. The matches will be played at The Belfry in 2001 
and at the K-Club in Ireland in 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would do so much for the Scottish tourist trade and give  
the whole country a lift,'' Montgomerie said. ``I would certainly 
give any play to host the event at Turnberry my full backing and 
offer any support that was needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TOUR AWARDS:* The PGA of America's decision to move the Grand  
Slam back a week to Nov. 22-23 so it could accommodate Tiger Woods 
has made quite an impact. 
</P>
<P>
	The late change kept British Open champion Paul Lawrie from  
representing Scotland the week before in the World Cup. It also has 
caused the PGA Tour to change its annual awards luncheon, 
originally planned for Nov. 23 at the World Golf Village. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour tentatively plans to announce the awards in late  
November or early December, then formally present them during the 
season-opening Mercedes Championship in Hawaii the first week of 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour is looking at several possibilities for the 2000 awards  
to make the occasion special. Commissioner Tim Finchem said one 
consideration is moving the awards to New York late in the year. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MISSING THE ACTION:* The player regarded as the greatest ever  
missed the greatest comeback in Ryder Cup history. Jack Nicklaus 
has his priorities these days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hunting in Arizona in the mountains with no  
television,'' said Nicklaus, who still has not seen replays of any 
shot. ``We got a report as it went on. When I heard it was 10-6, I 
told the guy at dinner, 'They're still going to win.' And they 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus has heard about the American celebration and shrugged  
it off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's enthusiasm,'' he said. ``Guys were excited. Maybe it  
turned out to be not quite perfect, but it was spontaneous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the gallery, Nicklaus said there will always be a few  
individuals to spoil the atmosphere. Told that the Red Sox-Yankees 
game was delayed Sunday night when fans threw debris onto the field 
at Fenway Park, Nicklaus shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
	``Must have been the same ones from the Ryder Cup,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	DIVOTS: The Disney Classic will be Tiger Woods' first tournament  
since the Ryder Cup -- and his first with sharper vision. Woods two 
weeks ago joined the growing list of players who have undergone 
Lasik eye surgery. ... Jack Nicklaus will make his debut in the 
Senior Tour's Legends of Golf next March, teaming with Raymond 
Floyd. ... Former U.S. Amateur champion Hank Kuehne made it through 
the first stage of qualifying -- barely. Kuehne closed with a 74 at 
Ranch Country Club in McKinney, Texas to advance by one stroke. ... 
With Jim Furyk winning in Las Vegas, players in their 20s have won 
18 of the 43 events on the PGA Tour this year. Rookies have won 
five tournaments (two each by Carlos Franco and Notah Begay, one by 
Rich Beem), the most since the tour started keeping such records in 
1970. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STAT OF THE WEEK:* Even though a player can earn $2.35 million  
by winning the last three tournaments of the year, only David 
Duval, Payne Stewart and Vijay Singh have a mathematical chance of 
surpassing Tiger Woods atop of the PGA Tour money list. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FINAL WORD:* ``There are only four each year, and I'm sure  
Tiger will win one and Garcia another, so I'm down to two.'' -- 
Colin Montgomerie, on whether he will ever win a major 
championship.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mostly Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar was mostly higher against major  
currencies Tuesday in hesitant trading before a key report on U.S. 
foreign trade. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 105.28 yen,  
up from 105.08 at the same point on Monday. The euro also fell 
against the dollar, dropping to $1.0838 from $1.0842. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little reaction to a report showing that U.S. consumer  
prices rose 0.4 percent, the biggest increase in five months, but 
in line with analyst forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market rallied after the report, having plunged on  
Friday after a report showing wholesale prices jumped 1.1 percent 
in August, the biggest gain in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	But many currency traders were more concerned about Wednesday  
morning's report on international trade for August. 
</P>
<P>
	With the U.S. trade gap between imports and exports at record  
levels, dollars have been flooding onto the world market, 
pressuring the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Tuesday, the British pound rose to $1.6720 from  
Monday's late quote of $1.6686. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, the dollar bought 1.4678 Swiss francs, up from 1.4650  
on Monday, and 1.4909 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4953. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8048 German 
marks, up from 1.8039 on Monday; 6.0529 French francs, up from 
6.0501; and 1,786.72 Italian lire, up from 1,785.90.

<HEADLINE> McDonnell Douglas Faces Indictment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. aerospace company and a Chinese company  
are expected to be charged with violating U.S. export controls 
after some machine tools were diverted in 1994 for possible use on 
Chinese missiles, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies are McDonnell Douglas, now a subsidiary of the  
Boeing Co., and the China National Aero-Technology Import Export 
Corp., (CATIC) a state-owned Chinese aerospace firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment of the two firms was expected to be announced at  
an afternoon news conference by U.S. Attorney Wilma A. Lewis and 
Commerce Department and Customs Service officials, according to 
three government officials, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Top Justice officials approved offering the companies a plea  
bargain of reduced charges in return for guilty pleas, but no deal 
could be reached, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involved McDonnell Douglas' sale in 1994 of 19 surplus  
machine tools to the Chinese company for $5 million. The U.S 
government had licensed the tools to the Chinese company only for 
use in China's Trunkliner commercial aircraft program. 
</P>
<P>
	However in April 1995, McDonnell Douglas notified the U.S.  
government that six of the licensed machine tools had been diverted 
to a facility that produced Chinese Silkworm cruise missiles and 
military aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors believe that the companies knew or should have known  
that the tools would be diverted before the diversion was reported, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not clear that the tools ever were used on the Chinese  
missiles. With the approval of the U.S. government, the tools have 
since been consolidated at a factory in Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
	When the decision to seek charges was first disclosed in early  
October, Larry McCracken, a spokesman for Boeing, said, ``We 
continue to believe that McDonnell Douglas acted properly in this 
matter. We've maintained that this is how the system was supposed 
to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing acquired McDonnell Douglas in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Lower on Price Hikes / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell Tuesday for a second straight  
session, as fears of rising inflation pushed the yield on the 
benchmark 30-year Treasury note near a two-year high. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 7/16 point, or $4.38  
per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite 
direction, rose to 6.35 percent from Monday's 6.32 percent. The 
jump represented the high mark for the yield since hitting 6.42 
percent on Oct. 22, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	As has been the pattern in recent trading sessions, the bond  
market reacted to activity in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock investors took heart from a government report that showed  
consumer prices had jumped 0.4 percent in September. But since the 
gains were caused primarily by increases in energy and tobacco 
prices, meaning overall inflation remained relatively quiet, 
investors jumped into the stock market, pushing the Dow Jones 
industrial average up 88.65 to 10204.93. 
</P>
<P>
	With stock market optimism on the rise, investors fled the less  
risky but also less profitable bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, analysts said the jump in the Consumer Price Index was  
probably enough for Federal Reserve Board policy makers to justify 
another interest rate increase next month to stem inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasury securities fell 1/16 point to 1/8  
point while intermediate maturities fell 5/32 point to 1/4 point, 
reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.13 percent as the  
discount fell 0.02 percentage point from Monday to 4.99 percent. 
Six-month yields rose to 5.22 percent, as the discount rose 0.01 
percentage point to 5.01 percent. One-year yields were 5.45 percent 
as the discount rose 0.03 percentage point to 5.16 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest commercial banks charge  
each other on overnight loans, fell to 5.00 percent from 5.19 
percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 108 25/32 from 109 1/16 late Monday. 
The average yield to maturity rose to 6.12 from 6.10 percent on 
Monday.

<HEADLINE> USC Aims To Build Basketball Arena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The University of Southern California plans  
to build a new arena across the street from campus. 
</P>
<P>
	The Trojans' basketball teams have played their home games at  
the Los Angeles Sports Arena since the facility was built 40 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed arena, which would be just a few blocks from the  
new Staples Center, would have a 12,000-seat capacity and cost up 
to $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Staples Center, new home of the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers  
of the NBA and the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, cost $375 million. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no timetable set for completion of USC's new arena,  
since fund-raising will be necessary to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	A Thursday news conference with USC president Steven Sample has  
been called to formally announce the plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The school's volleyball teams would also use the facility.

<HEADLINE> Most Military Officers Conservative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's leading military officers are  
overwhelmingly Republican conservatives and believe civilian 
society could benefit by adopting military values, according to a 
new academic study. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey of nearly 3,000 ``elite'' officers who had been  
recently promoted or were ready for promotion found eight 
Republicans for every Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of studies that document and proposes ways of  
breaching a gap between the military and civilians, scholars warn 
that the divide is widening and threatens military effectiveness 
and civil-military cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Triangle Institute for Security Studies' Project on the Gap  
Between the Military and Civilian Society released Monday includes 
the results of mailed surveys of military and civilian leaders and 
a national telephone poll of the public. 
</P>
<P>
	The surveys and studies find a big gap on several issues between  
military leaders and civilians, although they also documents strong 
respect for the military and broad acceptance of civilian control. 
</P>
<P>
	``The long tradition of an apolitical military has given way to  
a new reality in which the elite military is probably the most 
solidly Republican professional group in American society,'' the 
study said. It said sharply differing views on ideological issues 
further document the divide. 
</P>
<P>
	It found 64 percent of the officers proclaiming themselves  
Republican while 8 percent said they were Democrats, with 1 percent 
declaring other parties and 27 percent claiming independence or no 
preference. 
</P>
<P>
	This compares with 35 percent Democrats, 29 percent Republicans  
and 36 percent independents or other in the companion public 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 6 percent of military officers called themselves liberal,  
with less than 1 percent saying they were ``very liberal''; 65 
percent said they were conservative; and about a fifth of those 
labeled themselves ``very conservative'' or ``far right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On nearly all issues, the Triangle study showed results similar  
to an Associated Press poll published Monday documenting American 
confidence in the military. 
</P>
<P>
	The Triangle project also found strong military claims of  
respect for civilian society and a belief that military-civilian 
relations are good. 
</P>
<P>
	A summary of the studies led by Peter D. Feaver from Duke  
University and Richard H. Kohn from University of North Carolina at 
Chapel Hill, said, however, that ``mutual professions of support 
and confidence between civilians and the military rest on an 
underlying alienation that may in time erode the surface support 
each claims for the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Military officers tended far more than civilians to characterize  
civilian society as materialistic, self-indulgent, troubled and in 
need of reform, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
	It found 77 percent of the officers believed that wider  
acceptance of ``military values and customs'' would help civilian 
society. Only 23 percent of civilian nonveterans agreed. Positive 
military values were defined as hard work, discipline, honesty and 
loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Points of strongest disagreement were on the issues of women in  
combat and homosexuals serving openly in the military, on whether 
enough has been done to stop sexual harassment and on the necessity 
for a traditional male ``warrior culture'' for military 
effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	The study noted concern by Defense Secretary William Cohen and  
others about a civilian-military gap and said they are justified 
but have not reached crisis levels. It also cited the declining 
number of veterans serving in Congress -- the lowest since the early 
1900s -- but said this has had little impact on the way Congress 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
	And it found more confidence among military officers than among  
civilians that civilian control of the military will be maintained 
-- more than three-fourths agreement from the military elite 
compared with about half in the civilian survey. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was based on written surveys returned in 1998 and  
early 1999 by 2,901 elite military officers taking military courses 
at 14 institutions around the country. They also included officers 
up to the rank of one-star general. Feaver described those surveyed 
as a strong representation of future and present military leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	He said, however, the survey did not attempt to take a  
scientific sampling of the entire military. Civilians responding to 
the survey included 989 people listed in Who's Who in America, as 
well as leaders in diplomacy, media and labor. A separate telephone 
poll interviewed 1,001 Americans.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP Make Headway on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and congressional leaders  
agreed Tuesday not to use Social Security surpluses to pay for 
federal spending and to try resolving their budget impasse within 
the next week, participants said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we just have to roll up our sleeves,'' said Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., following an 80-minute meeting 
at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Republicans have made leaving Social Security  
surpluses alone a major goal of their budget fight with Clinton. 
The president has agreed, though at one point he also proposed 
using the surpluses if Republicans would agree to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, both parties have used Social Security's surpluses to  
cover spending for decades, and it has had no effect on the 
system's ability to pay benefits. But each party is eager to cast 
itself as a defender of the massive pension program for the elderly 
and disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans told reporters that Clinton had also agreed to  
abandon his effort to pay for extra spending for schools and other 
programs by raising taxes, including a 55-cents-per-pack increase 
in the federal cigarette tax. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats said that while Clinton conceded that Congress  
would not approve the full 55-cent boost, he believes a lesser 
increase remains politically viable. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a long way from 1 cent to 55 cents,'' said Senate  
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides said that beginning Wednesday, there will be an  
intensive effort to try resolving disputes that have so far blocked 
the enactment of eight of the 13 annual spending bills for the 
19-day old fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told the lawmakers that he will sign a sixth bill --  
covering veterans, housing and environmental programs -- on 
Wednesday. But he has either vetoed or threatened to veto five 
bills, and White House officials say that to increase his leverage, 
he might veto the $268 billion defense bill next Tuesday if the 
talks on the other measures are not going well. 
</P>
<P>
	White House chief of staff John Podesta said Clinton's budget  
chief, Jack Lew, would be on Capitol Hill negotiating details of 
the remaining bills with congressional budget writers. 
</P>
<P>
	The discussions will also include proposals -- largely supported  
by both sides -- to extend expired tax breaks for corporate research 
and development and other purposes. The two sides also said they 
will discuss rolling back some reductions in Medicare 
reimbursements to hospitals and nursing homes that were enacted as 
part of the 1997 budget-balancing deal between Clinton and 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Others attending the session included House Speaker Dennis  
Hastert, R-Ill.; House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas; House 
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and Treasury Secretary 
Lawrence Summers. 
</P>
<P>
	Also there was Vice President Al Gore, who participants said  
discussed the administration's concerns about environmental issues 
and paying unpaid dues to the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> GE Recalls 3.1 Million Dishwashers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- General Electric is recalling 3.1 million  
dishwashers that might catch fire because of a faulty switch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday the recall  
includes GE and Hotpoint brand dishwashers with the model numbers 
GSD500D, GSD500G, GSD540, HDA467, HDA477 or HDA487. The recalled 
models also have a serial number that has a second letter of A, M, 
R, S, T, V or Z. 
</P>
<P>
	The model and serial numbers can be found on a rectangular label  
on either the right or left of the inner tub's front edge, the CPSC 
said. The dishwashers were made between April 1983 and January 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	GE and the CPSC are aware of 50 incidents in which the slide  
switch, which selects the heat drying and energy save functions, 
melted and ignited fires. Seven of the fires spread beyond the 
dishwashers and three caused damage to homes. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries have been reported.  
</P>
<P>
	The commission said consumers should stop using the recalled  
dishwashers immediately and should keep the machine's door 
unlatched to keep electricity from the faulty switch. 
</P>
<P>
	GE is offering owners of the faulty models a rebate toward the  
purchase of a new dishwasher. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	For information about the recall program, consumers can call  
1-800-599-2929 or connect to the GE web site at

<HEADLINE> Rams' Horne Suspended Four Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis Rams receiver Tony Horne, who  
returned kickoffs for touchdowns in each of the last two games, was 
suspended for four games by the NFL on Tuesday for violating the 
league's substance abuse policy. 
</P>
<P>
	No additional details were released in a two-sentence statement  
from the NFL. A call Tuesday night to the Rams wasn't immediately 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Horne answered an Atlanta touchdown with a 101-yard return  
Sunday, giving the Rams (5-0) a 14-7 lead. A week earlier, his 
97-yard return was St. Louis' final touchdown in a blowout of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Horne, who played at Clemson, was named the Rams' most  
productive special teams player as a rookie last season. He had 56 
kickoff returns for 1,306 yards -- a 23.3-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
	He will miss home games against Cleveland and Carolina, and  
games at Tennessee and Detroit. Horne is eligible to return for the 
Nov. 21 game at San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Sign Arena League QB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals signed Sherdrick  
Bonner to a one-year contract Tuesday, making the former Arizona 
Rattlers star the second Arena Football League quarterback on an 
NFL roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonner will back up Dave Brown and rookie Chris Greisen as the  
Cardinals' third-string quarterback during Jake Plummer's four- to 
six-week recovery period. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer broke his right ring finger on Sunday when he caught it  
in the face mask of the Washington Redskins' Shawn Barber. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old Bonner played one game for the Rattlers this  
year, going 22-of-39 for 298 yards, six touchdowns and one 
interception in a 73-47 Arena Bowl semifinal loss to Albany. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonner, a left-hander from Cal State-Northridge, is the  
Rattlers' leading career passer. He tried out with the Miami 
Dolphins in 1995 and was on the Atlanta Falcons practice squad the 
last five weeks of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Warner, who played for Iowa in the Arena League, has led  
the St. Louis Rams to a 5-0 start this year. He has thrown for 15 
touchdowns and three interceptions and leads the NFL in quarterback 
rating. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals waived cornerback Justin Lucas to make room for  
Bonner and also released wide receiver Chad Carpenter from their 
practice squad. They replaced Carpenter with offensive lineman Jon 
Clark, who had been waived Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Farm Bailout May Be Needed Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the Senate Agriculture  
Committee says Congress is likely to consider a third straight 
bailout of the farm economy next year, barring a rebound in 
commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress sent President Clinton an $8.7 billion package of  
emergency farm assistance last week, the second such measure in as 
many years. Clinton is expected to sign the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thought will be, 'Are you going to stand by while farms go  
out of business?' My guess is that the response of Republicans and 
Democrats will be, 'No, we're not going to stand by','' said Sen. 
Richard Lugar, R-Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	With this year's package, direct payments to farmers are  
expected to reach a record $21 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for most crops collapsed two years ago amid the financial  
crises in Asia and Russia and heavy production worldwide. Without 
major weather problems, economists say grain prices will remain low 
through next year. 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, Lugar's House counterpart, Rep. Larry  
Combest, R-Texas, recently announced plans to conduct a 
comprehensive review next year of the GOP-authored 1996 farm law. 
</P>
<P>
	Lugar, speaking to reporters after a speech to commodity groups,  
said he had no plans to hold similar hearings in his committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He would not say whether he would consider any changes to the  
law that the House might propose. ``There's no way I can react 
hypothetically to a bill that might arise, without knowing the 
content and what it is they examined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law, popularly known as ``Freedom to Farm,'' ended a  
Depression-era system of production controls and price supports in 
an attempt to wean farmers from their dependence on government 
programs. Farm groups said the law doesn't guarantee them 
sufficient income. 
</P>
<P>
	Lugar said he was opposed to increasing crop subsidies by  
raising the minimum prices that the government guarantees farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you guarantee a certain price, then markets react to that  
by farmers planting more,'' Lugar said. ``If our problem is 
oversupply already, the decision to move those targets upward might 
create more supply.''

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Jose Strengthening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- With winds increasing to within 9 mph of being  
hurricane strength, Tropical Storm Jose marched Tuesday toward the 
Leeward Islands in the northeastern Caribbean, threatening to 
become a hurricane before nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's coming up in strength,'' said Jack Bevin, hurricane  
specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ``It could 
(become a hurricane) today, could be some time this afternoon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 a.m. EDT, the storm's center was near 14.0 north latitude  
and 58.0 west longitude, about 240 miles east-southeast of Dominica 
in the Leeward Islands of the Lesser Antilles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Leeward Islands are the ones that are really in threat of  
being hit,'' said Michael Formosa, meteorologist at the Center. 
</P>
<P>
	A tropical storm warning was in effect for Barbados early  
Tuesday, while a hurricane watch was in effect for the Leeward 
Islands from Anguilla to Montserrat, and for St. Lucia in the 
Windward Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Vincent and the Grenadines were under a tropical storm  
watch. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands were urged  
to closely monitor the storm's progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Grenada was no longer under a tropical storm watch early  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose was moving west-northwest near 13 mph and this motion was  
expected to continue for the next 24 hours. Maximum sustained winds 
were near 65 mph, with higher gusts. Tropical storm force winds 
extended outward up to 60 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Tropical storms become hurricanes once their top sustained winds  
reach 74 mph. Jose is the 10th tropical storm of the 1999 season, 
which runs from June 1 through Nov. 30.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Moves Vs. hazardous Cargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Northwest Airlines no longer will accept  
dangerous goods for commercial shipment on its passenger airplanes, 
effective Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagan-based carrier will continue to carry such materials,  
when properly prepared for shipment, aboard its Boeing 747 
freighters, said Richard Anderson, executive vice president and 
chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The category ``dangerous goods'' includes such items as  
oil-based paints, paint thinners, automobile batteries, infectious 
substances, toxic or poisonous materials, flammable adhesives, 
industrial solvents, bleach and acids. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are continuously reviewing our procedures for ways to  
improve our operations,'' Anderson said. ``We have concluded that 
we can best serve our customers by only transporting commercial 
hazardous goods aboard cargo aircraft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 percent of the nation's airlines will not knowingly  
accept any hazardous materials aboard passenger planes. Northwest 
is not among those airlines because it will continue to carry the 
materials in some cases, spokeswoman Marta Laughlin said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest's policy change was announced two days after two of  
its baggage handlers were slightly injured when exposed to 
unauthorized hazardous materials aboard a passenger plane at 
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Airport authorities say the employees became nauseated after  
inhaling fumes while they removed a box of electronic equipment 
from the plane after it arrived from Detroit. Authorities say 
hydrochloric acid and other chemicals seeped from vials in the box. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say those materials weren't listed on the manifest  
and they don't know whether the chemicals were mistakenly or 
intentionally put in the box. The Federal Aviation Administration 
is investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest said it will continue to permit small quantities of  
some hazardous materials to be brought aboard by passengers for 
personal use, as allowed by national and international rules.

<HEADLINE> CompUSA To Hire Black Ad Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A protest urging CompUSA to advertise with  
black-oriented media has ended with the nation's largest computer 
retailer promising to hire a black-owned advertising firm and offer 
store discounts to the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're using urban radio, just not to the extent we should  
be,'' CompUSA chief executive Jim Halpin said Tuesday on ``The Tom 
Joyner Morning Show,'' a radio program that galvanized the protest. 
``I got bad advice but it wasn't bad intended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the protest began 10 weeks ago, the Dallas-based retailer  
has been inundated with calls and letters, Halpin said. Host Joyner 
and Black Entertainment Television commentator Tavis Smiley, a 
regular on the show, urged listeners to send the company cash 
register receipts from their purchases at CompUSA to illustrate 
black buyers' impact on the company's bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of your customers actually took time to send in  
receipts,'' said Halpin, who is offering a 10 percent store 
discount to all those who mailed receipts. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of equality for blacks is not a new one for the show  
which has emerged as a voice on black issues. It is broadcast by 
ABC Radio Network to more than 100 stations. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, outcry from the show's listeners has been pivotal  
in prodding the award of a Congressional Gold Medal to civil rights 
pioneer Rosa Parks and a decision to remove slave memorabilia from 
a scheduled auction at Christie's in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The CompUSA matter stemmed from a dispute a year ago involving  
the Katz Media Group, which sells advertising time for hundreds of 
radio stations nationwide. Katz issued a memo advising clients to 
limit advertising on stations targeting black or Latino audiences 
because ``advertisers want prospects, not suspects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The memo galvanized a coalition of black and Latino broadcasters  
and activists. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of discussions to resolve that dispute, Katz agreed to  
identify companies that did not do significant business with black 
media. CompUSA was one of those companies cited, according to 
Smiley. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has not given specifics on its advertising budget.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was hitting black America. We had advertised on  
black stations and you showed us that's not enough,'' Halpin said 
Tuesday. ``I want to sell computers to anyone who walks in the 
door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the argument between the show and CompUSA was over, there  
was still tension between the ABC Radio Network and the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``ABC did tell us they were going to pull the plug'' last week  
if further comments were made about CompUSA, Joyner said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner said the network expressed concern that the company might  
sue, but Halpin said the company never threatened a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Network officials denied they were attempting to censor the show  
but wanted to make sure that statements on the air concerning the 
CompUSA controversy were accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did ask Tom to hold off discussing CompUSA for one day,''  
Julie Hoover, a network spokeswoman in New York, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Network president Lyn Andrews earlier issued a statement saying,  
``The issue is an important one. There is no dispute between us and 
Tom on that. It is also important, however, to be certain any 
statements are accurate and in context.''

<HEADLINE> Chicago Foster Parents Win Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A judge abandoned her efforts Tuesday to reunite  
a black recovering addict with her 3-year-old son and ruled that 
the boy must remain indefinitely with his influential, white foster 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Judith Brawka said the youngster known as Baby T -- who was  
born with cocaine in his system -- has suffered enough disruption 
and is already showing symptoms of serious emotional trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``The transition isn't working. ... This court will not force  
more disaster into this child's life,'' Brawka told the boy's 
mother, Tina Olison, at a Circuit Court hearing. Outside, about two 
dozen Olison supporters picketed and chanted ``Free Baby T! Free 
Baby T!'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a complete turnaround from last March, when Brawka  
ordered a one-year transition to move the boy from the foster 
parents, Appellate Judge Anne Burke and Chicago Alderman Edward 
Burke, to live with Ms. Olison. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the judge said Baby T should be reunited with his  
mother and older brother and that black culture should be a factor 
in their upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Burkes, who have had custody of Baby T since shortly after  
his birth, are near the center of Chicago's Democratic power elite. 
She is a prominent judge who once headed the state's child-welfare 
agency. He is chairman of the City Council's Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Olison, 37, who has kicked her cocaine habit and gotten a  
job, was impassive as she listened to the decision Tuesday. She 
declined to comment afterward, saying she had to consult with her 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook County Public Guardian Patrick Murphy, who had supported  
her bid for custody, switched sides last week and said Baby T 
should stay with the Burkes. He cited such problems as squabbling 
between Ms. Olison and a social worker and her refusal at one point 
to attend therapy sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Brawka, a suburban Kane County judge brought in to assure that  
the Burkes' political influence would not be a factor, also warned 
Ms. Olison that she also could fail to get custody of her older 
son, identified as Baby B if she continues squabbling with social 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Baby B is in his grandmother's custody.

<HEADLINE> Telecom Merger Mania Takes Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- The bigger-is-better mentality reshaping the U.S.  
communications industry is spreading to Europe, a market no longer 
handcuffed by government interests and national borders. 
</P>
<P>
	In the space of two days, the former French and German telephone  
monopolies have revealed plans to invade the other's turf. Another 
German giant, meanwhile, is eyeing Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	It began Monday with France Telecom announcing a deal to buy a  
majority stake in E-Plus, Germany's third-largest mobile phone 
company, for 7.4 billion euros, or about $7.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom struck back on Tuesday, saying a deal to  
increase its presence in France was expected shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We, of course, will not let this be unanswered,'' the German  
company's chief for western Europe, Paul Grosse, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The feud between those companies has been percolating since May,  
when plans to form a global partnership fizzled amid a bungled 
effort by Deutsche Telekom to buy Telecom Italia. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's more than just cross-border rivalries causing the  
companies to seek partners outside their home countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``This trend is unavoidable if you want to be a global player in  
telecommunications,'' said Theo Kitz, an industry analyst at Merck 
Finck and Co. in Munich, Germany.

<P>
	Notably, Germany's Mannesmann AG confirmed Tuesday it is holding  
talks to buy Orange PLC, a British mobile phone company, for a 
reported $26.6 billion. The move by Germany's second-largest 
telecom concern comes after Deutsche Telekom agreed to buy One2One, 
a smaller British mobile phone company, for $11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The flurry of activity is a natural response, analysts say, to  
the global alliances being formed by the likes of AT&AMP;T and British 
Telecommunications or Vodafone AirTouch and Bell Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old structures which were based on natural boundaries are  
no longer commercially viable in an environment where competition 
is increasing,'' said Mark Horn, head of European research for T. 
Hoare Canaccord, a London stock brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe's smaller telecom players are interested in mergers even  
though they've snagged decent shares of their domestic markets from 
the former state monopolies. With technology and the market 
evolving so rapidly, they need to pool their resources to remain 
viable competitors, said Horn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's adapt or die,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
	WEXFORD, Ireland (AP) -- Sean Cloney, a Catholic farmer whose  
marriage to his Protestant childhood sweetheart engulfed a rural 
community in sectarianism, died Tuesday of pneumonia. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	The story of Cloney and his wife, the former Sheila Kelly, was  
made into an Irish film last year called ``A Love Divided,'' which 
reflected deep-rooted religious divides and the sway of the 
Catholic clergy in rural Ireland in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Cloney's decision to educate her daughters at home instead  
of a Catholic school in the village of Fethard-on-Sea, in County 
Wexford, prompted a parish priest to orchestrate a 1957 boycott of 
Protestant businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The boycott ended when the Kelly family and the local lawmaker,  
a Catholic, made a joint appeal and a priest bought a pack of 
cigarettes from a Protestant-owned shop. Mrs. Cloney continued to 
educate her children at home.

	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Hamilton H. ``Terry'' Gilkyson III, the  
singer-songwriter who wrote an eclectic range of music spanning 
folk to calypso to Disney movies, died Friday. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilkyson's 1968 song, ``The Bare Necessities,'' for Disney's  
``Jungle Book,'' was nominated for an Academy Award. During the 
1960s, he wrote a song a week for ``The Wonderful World of Disney'' 
TV show and later wrote theme songs for Disney movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilkyson songs were recorded by Johnny Cash, Tony Bennett, The  
Kingston Trio, Mitch Miller, Spike Jones, Marlene Dietrich, Doris 
Day, Harry Connick Jr. and Louis Armstrong. He also co-wrote with 
his group, Terry Gilkyson and the Easy Riders, including ``Memories 
are Made of This,'' the hit recorded by Dean Martin.

He was 89. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Gulf War Report Raises Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Pentagon-financed study concludes that a  
drug given to U.S. troops during the Persian Gulf war to protect 
against a nerve gas cannot be ruled out as a possible cause for 
what has come to be known as Gulf War syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Department officials were presenting the 385-page review  
of scientific literature on the drug pyriostigmine bromide, or PB, 
at a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
	Prepared By Beatrice Alexandra Golomb of Rand Corp., a  
California think tank, the study says PB ``cannot be ruled out'' as 
a cause of lingering illnesses in some veterans of the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	``This does not imply that it is necessarily a causal factor,  
only that the possibility cannot be dismissed,'' she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The author is a physician at San Diego Veterans Affairs Medical  
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart declined comment, saying he  
was ``not willing to speculate ... while the investigation and the 
review is still ongoing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the cautious nature of the conclusion, the Rand review  
of about 1,000 published studies on the drug gives somewhat more 
credence to the hypothesis that it could cause or contribute to 
Gulf War syndrome, a vague array of symptoms including chronic 
pain, digestive problems, nausea, skin rashes, fatigue, aching 
joints, memory loss and concentration problems. 
</P>
<P>
	PB was given to an estimated 300,000 soldiers during the war as  
protection against the nerve gas soman. The Pentagon has earmarked 
about $20 million, of $133 million spent researching Gulf War 
syndrome, specifically to study the effects of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post, The New York Times and the Los Angeles  
Times all reported on the Rand review in advance of today's news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a `Eureka,''' Dr. Sue Bailey, assistant secretary  
of defense for health affairs, told the Los Angeles paper. 
</P>
<P>
	She said PB is still considered an invaluable tool against  
poison gas and will continue to be used. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is life and death versus the possibility of some long-term  
side effects,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules Women Can Sue Ford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A federal judge has ruled that 850 women can sue  
Ford Motor Co. over allegations of sexual harassment at two 
Chicago-area plants. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Elaine E. Bucklo said Ford's offer last  
month to settle charges over the case with the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission was ``disappointing'' and lacked meaningful 
``bite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her ruling Friday, Bucklo certified a class action based on  
two lawsuits originally brought by 14 women last year. The cases 
have now been consolidated. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, Ford agreed to pay more than $7.5 million to  
female workers who have faced sexual and racial harassment at its 
assembly plant on the city's far South Side and a stamping plant in 
suburban Chicago Heights. The settlement was engineered by the 
EEOC, which also got Ford to agree to adopt new personnel policies 
and training for workers to deal with sexual harassment on the job 
at all of its U.S. facilities. The cost for the training alone was 
estimated by the EEOC at $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Hunt and Katherine Rodosky, attorneys for the women, said  
the harassment included sexually explicit and derogatory graffiti 
in public areas of the plants, demeaning comments made to and about 
women and minorities and inappropriate physical contact. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the women's attorneys said the judge's decision  
overrides the EEOC settlement.

<HEADLINE> Wells Fargo Posts Record Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Wells Fargo &AMP; Company reported Tuesday a 30  
percent increase in third-quarter profits as the banking and 
investment company continued to combine systems following its 
merger with Norwest Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells Fargo, the nation's seventh-largest bank, posted net  
income of $962 million, or 57 cents a share, matching analysts' 
estimate. The San Francisco-based bank earned $742 million or 45 
cents a share for the same quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	President and CEO Dick Kovacevich credits the successful merger  
of Norwest and Wells Fargo for the earnings momentum his company 
has seen for the third consecutive quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because we're combining the best of both systems, we believe  
this is the most complex conversion in banking history,'' 
Kovacevich said. ``We intend also to make it the most successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells Fargo and Norwest completed their merger in November 1998,  
creating a company with $196 billion in assets, 15 million 
customers and 5,836 stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors liked the results and sent Wells Fargo's shares up  
$2.12 1/2 to $41.62 1/2 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Net interest income was $2.4 billion in the third quarter of  
1999, compared with $2.28 billion for the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Noninterest income in the third quarter of 1999 was $1.81  
billion, a 12 percent increase from $1.62 billion in the year-ago 
period. Wells Fargo said the gain was from higher mortgage serving 
fees, investment fees and commissions and venture capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings for the first nine months of 1999 were a record $2.8  
billion, a 30 percent increase over the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Net interest income totaled $7 billion vs. $6.7 billion.  
Noninterest income rose 10 percent to $5.35 billion from $4.87 
billion in the first nine months of last year.

<HEADLINE>  Cyclone Kills 56 in Eastern India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Air force helicopters dropped food  
packets today on waterlogged areas of eastern India that were cut 
off by a cyclone that killed at least 56 people, news agencies 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ordered federal and state  
officials to make an aerial survey of the worst affected district, 
Ganjam, so that national assistance can be given, the United News 
of India reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganjam bore the brunt of the 125-mph cyclone winds that tore  
down electrical pylons and telephone poles, disrupted train and 
road services, smashed huts and killed at least 56 people since 
Sunday, the United News Agency of India and the Press Trust of 
India reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-three people were killed in the town of Berhampur, in  
Ganjam, which was marooned in five feet of water, PTI said. The 
death toll was likely to mount as several people were believed to 
be trapped inside their collapsed houses. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of houses and huts in low-lying areas of Andhra Pradesh  
were damaged by swirling winds and water, which also uprooted 
coconut and cashew trees before the storm abated today, PTI said.

	Consumer Prices Jump 0.4 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inflation at the consumer level jumped 0.4  
percent in September, the biggest increase in five months, 
reflecting sharply higher prices for gasoline, cigarettes and 
clothing. The Labor Department said last month's increase in the 
Consumer Price Index, the government's most closely watched 
inflation gauge, followed a 0.3 percent rise in August. So far this 
year, consumer prices have been rising at an annual rate of 2.8 
percent, sharply higher than the tiny 1.6 percent increase in 1998. 
But rising worries about inflation have set off alarm bells on Wall 
Street with investors concerned that the Federal Reserve will be 
forced to raise interest rates again at their next meeting on Nov. 
16. 

</P>
<P>
	Social Security Checks To Increase  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 44.2 million Americans getting Social  
Security checks will see them grow by 2.4 percent next year, the 
biggest cost of living increase in three years. The 2000 increase 
will be nearly twice the size of this year's 1.3 percent raise, 
mainly because of a recent upward creep in consumer prices. Social 
Security Commissioner Kenneth S. Apfel said today that the 
cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, means the average monthly check 
for retirees will rise by $19, from $785 to $804. In addition to 
retirement checks, Social Security benefits affected include those 
paid to disabled workers and families whose breadwinners have died. 

</P>
<P>
	Stocks Push Ahead; Dow Up 170.97  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were sharply higher this morning after a  
key report on inflation showed that prices at the consumer level 
have increased no more steeply than analysts had anticipated. Just 
before 11 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 170.97 
at 10,287.25. Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq 
composite index was up 24.37 at 2,713.52. A persistent fear that 
inflation is on the rise has hampered stocks in recent weeks, 
driving the Dow 10.7 percent below its Aug. 25 record close.

</P>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp. said a  
higher-than-expected surge in the price of computer memory chips 
will likely hurt its third-quarter earnings. An earthquake in 
Taiwan last month disrupted production at factories that produce 
between 12 percent and 15 percent of the world's random access 
memory, or RAM, chips. RAM is important to a computer because it 
stores information that a processor might need at another point, 
allowing a user and the computer to more rapidly switch back and 
forth between tasks for everything from screensavers to 
spreadsheets to games. Dell stock was down 3 9/16 at 37 3/4 this

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a 10-week campaign by black consumers to  
compel CompUSA to advertise with black-oriented media, the 
president of the computer retailer is promising to hire a 
black-owned advertising agency and offer 10 percent discounts to 
protesters. ``I tell you I wish it hadn't taken so long,'' CompUSA 
chief executive Jim Halpin said today in an appearance on the 
syndicated black radio program ``The Tom Joyner Morning Show.'' 
Show co-hosts Tom Joyner and Black Entertainment Television 
commentator Tavis Smiley galvanized the drive, which included 
listeners sending the company cash register receipts to graphically 
illustrate black buyers' impact on CompUSA's bottom line. CompUSA 
stock was unchanged at 6 1/16.

<P>
	DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- Germany's Mannesmann AG is  
discussing a possible purchase of the British mobile telephone 
company Orange PLC. A day after France Telecom bid for Germany's 
E-Plus mobile phone operator, Mannesmann said today it is in talks 
with Orange's largest shareholder, Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa, 
that could lead to a takeover. The Wall Street Journal Europe, 
citing unidentified sources, reported today the bid was about $26.6 
billion. Mannesmann, Germany's second-largest telecoms operator, 
had expressed interest in expanding into Britain after rival 
Deutsche Telekom announced in August it was buying One2One for $11 
billion.

	CAMP HILL, Pa. (AP) -- Rite Aid Corp.'s shares shot up 20 percent  
this morning as it shopped for a new chairman and chief executive 
to nurse the nation's third-largest drug store chain back to 
health. Martin L. Grass resigned yesterday as the company struggled 
to overcome a mountain of debt accumulated through rapid expansion 
in recent years. Grass, who took over the company in 1995, has also 
faced questions that he held stakes in several suppliers and real 
estate interests that do business with the company. Rite Aid's

	Nissan Plan Worries Japan Leaders

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese leaders today expressed concern about a  
restructuring plan announced by Nissan Motor and its potential 
impact on the country's fledgling economic recovery. Japan's 
second-largest carmaker announced plans yesterday to cut 21,000 
jobs and close several plants in a restructuring effort generally 
recognized as a crucial step toward reviving the troubled company. 
But Trade Minister Takashi Fukaya, while acknowledging Nissan's 
dilemma, said he wanted the company to study more ``natural'' ways 
of cutting its work force. He suggested one way would be to reduce 
the number of new hires rather than direct layoffs.

	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Banco Bilbao Vizcaya plans to merge with  
Argentaria to create Spain's second largest bank, the Bank of Spain 
confirmed today. Details of the deal were to be announced at a 
joint press conference scheduled by the banks later in the day. The 
merged institution will be second in size to Banco Santander 
Central Hispano, itself the product of a merger announced in 
January.

	HONOLULU (AP) -- Dockworkers are moving toward calling a strike  
that would cripple the islands. The union representing Hawaii's 
dockworkers terminated its contract with four shipping companies 
last night, creating uncertainty for island residents almost 
totally dependent on ships to deliver food and other goods. The 
International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 142 gave notice 
Friday to the Hawaii Employers Council that it would terminate the 
current contract yesterday, a move union leaders hoped would bring 
a sense of urgency to negotiations with four shipping companies.

	Clinton, GOP Set To Meet on Budget  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House set a combative tone for  
budget talks with Republicans, telling GOP congressional leaders to 
``put aside their talking points and their attack ads'' when they 
meet with President Clinton this evening. Republicans, meanwhile, 
said they would put Clinton on notice that they will not raise 
taxes or use Social Security surpluses to pay for the extra 
spending that the president wants. White House press secretary Joe 
Lockhart said Clinton hoped to reach a ``framework'' for a wider 
budget agreement but ``has no particular mechanism in mind.''

	MIAMI (AP) -- With winds increasing to within 9 mph of being  
hurricane strength, Tropical Storm Jose marched today toward the 
Leeward Islands in the northeastern Caribbean, threatening to 
become a hurricane before nightfall. ``It's coming up in 
strength,'' said Jack Bevin, hurricane specialist at the National 
Hurricane Center in Miami. ``It could (become a hurricane) ... some 
time this afternoon.'' A tropical storm warning was in effect for 
Barbados early today, while a hurricane watch was in effect for the 
Leeward Islands from Anguilla to Montserrat, and for St. Lucia in 
the Windward Islands.

	Jewish Settlers Resist Dismantling

<P>
	SHVUT RACHEL, West Bank (AP) -- Jewish settlers resisted the  
government's first attempt to dismantle an illegal settlement 
outpost in the West Bank today, prompting officials to postpone the 
action. Several dozen settlers sat on a makeshift barricade of 
boulders, rusty tin barrels and old tires, blocking the path of a 
flatbed truck that was to cart away a large storage container they 
had planted to claim a hilltop. The protest came despite a 
compromise worked out last week between Prime Minister Ehud Barak 
and the Jewish Settlers' Council.

	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- The U.N. war crimes tribunal

crimes against humanity counts he has confessed to do not 
constitute a campaign of atrocities. Ending its first genocide 
trial, the tribunal said Goran Jelisic -- who allegedly called 
himself ``Adolf'' in a reference to Hitler -- did not commit crimes 
consistent with the strict definition of genocide, the court's most 
serious offense.

	Social Security Checks To Increase

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 44.2 million Americans getting Social  
Security checks will see them grow by 2.4 percent next year, the 
biggest cost of living increase in three years. The 2000 increase 
will be nearly twice the size of this year's 1.3 percent raise, 
mainly because of a recent upward creep in consumer prices. Social 
Security Commissioner Kenneth S. Apfel said today that the 
cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, means the average monthly check 
for retirees will rise by $19, from $785 to $804.

yesterday sent Dell shares tumbling 8 percent this morning on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market, dropping 3 9/16 to 37 3/4. An earthquake in

<HEADLINE> U.N. Adopts Anti-Terror Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council today unanimously  
adopted a resolution stating that all acts of terrorism are 
criminal regardless of the cause. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke called on all nations to stand  
together and relentlessly combat terrorists and their supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States' policy on terrorism is clear and it is  
simple: Terrorism is a criminal activity -- regardless of 
circumstance or reason. There are no mitigating factors,'' he said. 
``Despite the risks involved, we must summon the political courage 
to address this threat at home and abroad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Against a backdrop of recent bombings and killings from Russia  
and Kosovo to East Timor and Burundi, the council held a formal 
meeting to adopt the resolution renewing the U.N. commitment to 
combat terrorism and bring perpetrators to justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought that the recent upsurge in terrorist actions,  
including against United Nations personnel, would warrant a 
reiteration of the Security Council readiness to contribute to the 
fighting of international terrorism,'' Russia's U.N. ambassador, 
Sergey Lavrov, the current council president, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The council's formal meeting follows its threat last Friday of  
limited sanctions if Afghanistan's Taliban Islamic movement does 
not deliver Saudi exile Osama bin Laden to stand trial for last 
year's twin U.S. embassy bombings in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke called this U.S. initiative ``a significant example of  
what can be achieved when we work in a cooperative spirit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, Britain and Brazil said the next step should  
be the adoption of a a new treaty proposed by France that would 
make the financing of terrorist activities a crime. Today's 
resolution doesn't call for sanctions, but instead focuses on the 
need for global cooperation to fight terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	It unequivocally condemns all terrorist acts as ``criminal and  
unjustifiable regardless of their motivation'' and calls on all 
countries to adopt and implement all international treaties against 
terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	It urges all nations to cooperate in combating terrorism, to  
prevent the financing of terrorist activities, and to ``deny those 
who plan, finance or commit terrorist acts safe havens by ensuring 
their apprehension and prosecution or extradition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's U.N. ambassador, Jeremy Greenstock, said it was sad  
that some nations still argue that terrorist acts are justified in 
some circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow has become an especially vocal campaigner against  
terrorism following four recent bombings in Russia, which killed 
some 300 people. Russia blames the violence on Chechens and other 
secessionist-minded Islamic militants. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has called for a U.N. conference or a special session of  
the General Assembly in 2000 on combating terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrorists have been making headlines elsewhere as well.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, two U.N. aid workers were slain by Hutu rebels in  
Burundi, a U.N. civilian official was beaten and shot to death in 
Kosovo, and seven U.N. workers were taken hostage in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Tamil rebels in Sri Lanka massacred about 50  
villagers, and pro-Indonesian militias went on a killing, looting 
and burning rampage in East Timor after its people voted for 
independence. Leftist rebels in Colombia have stepped up a wave of 
kidnappings.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Ready To Free E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- In President B.J. Habibie's 16 months  
in power, a crisis exploded in the territory of East Timor, a 
banking corruption scandal broke and Indonesia's huge economic 
problems continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Those issues were laid bare as Indonesia's legislature appeared  
ready to grant East Timor independence today and debated who they 
will choose to be the country's next president in a vote scheduled 
for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the legislature, thousands of supporters of Habibie and  
his rival, Megawati Sukarnoputri, clogged the streets of Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	In a serious setback to Habibie's chances, Gen. Wiranto, the  
defense minister and commander of Indonesia's powerful military, 
failed to accept an invitation by Habibie to be his vice 
presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in an ambiguous speech on national television Monday  
night, Wiranto also said he might enter politics if the people need 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislators spoke today in favor of ending Indonesia's 24-year  
occupation of East Timor and accepting the results of an 
independence referendum there six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor's overwhelming vote for independence led to a wave of  
killings, looting and arson by pro-Indonesian militias there and 
their Indonesian military allies that only ended with the 
deployment of an Australian-led multinational peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers said privately that ratification of the independence  
vote was a mere formality and could be approved late tonight in a 
voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The 700 member People's Consultative Assembly also debated  
whether to endorse or condemn Habibie's 16-month record, a decision 
that could determine whether the Golkar Party holds onto him as its 
highly unpopular presidential candidate in Wednesday's election by 
the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a last-minute move could alter the outcome of the vote for  
the first elected head of state since President Suharto was driven 
from power in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie watched today as Golkar supported Habibie's record, and  
other factions rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
	The president introduced some basic democratic changes following  
the end of Suharto's authoritarian reign, but his popularity has 
sunk because of his close ties to Suharto and his inability to end 
human rights abuses and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to East Timor, Habibie has been criticized for a  
massive bank scandal linked to his inner circle and Indonesia's 
huge economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie, Wiranto and Jakarta's police chief issued stern  
warnings that they will not tolerate demonstrations that close main 
thoroughfares in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice last week, police and soldiers fired tear gas and plastic  
bullets to disperse large, anti-Habibie demonstrations outside 
parliament and in the city's business center. Dozens of people were 
hospitalized or arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, protests have been held every day at major crossings  
in the capital, but they have remained peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
	A line of riot police today kept flag-waving activists from  
rival political camps apart at Jakarta's main traffic circle, a 
focal point of demonstrations. Later, several thousand flag-waving 
Megawati supporters gathered there. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 5,000 Habibie supporters marched from the central  
business district toward parliament demanding the legislature not 
elect Megawati, whose party won the most of seats in parliament in 
a June election, but failed to win a majority. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Megawati, Habibie is expected to face  
presidential candidate Abdurrahman Wahid, founder of the 
Muslim-oriented National Awakening Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie was appointed president 16 months ago when the  
authoritarian Suharto, his mentor, stepped down after 32 years of 
iron-fisted rule in the face of a violent protest movement. 
</P>
<P>
	In an emotional speech Monday, Habibie urged Indonesians to let  
him stay in office to continue democratic reforms. ``I don't want 
to say goodbye. I don't want to bid farewell,'' he told several 
hundred soldiers and police at a national monument in central 
Jakarta.

<HEADLINE> Ray To Conclude Whitewater Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a young attorney not long out of law  
school, Robert Ray went all the way to the highest court in the 
state of New York in an eight-year legal battle to save his 
family's mountainside cottage. Now he is taking on an even more 
grueling challenge -- to bring closure to the Whitewater probe. 
</P>
<P>
	The saga of the Ray family cottage in Fishkill, N.Y., shows that  
``there are a few attorneys smarter than Bobby is, maybe some more 
eloquent,'' but ``I don't know of any who make more of a habit of 
winning,'' says his brother, Russell, a lawyer who now has his own 
firm in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray's arguments in a trial before a local court were so  
compelling that the judge drove out to the mountain in a blizzard 
and went up in a four-wheel-drive vehicle to take a look at the 
Rays' cottage for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best trial attorneys are good storytellers'' and ``Bobby  
has a knack of ... making you identify with his point of view; you 
trust him,'' said Russell Ray. ``We wouldn't have won that case 
unless Bobby let that judge become almost part of the family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of an idyllic 154-acre tract of woods on the side of  
Mount Beacon terminated the leases of the 21 families who owned 
summer residences there, including the Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	``The owner didn't pay us a dime'' for the modest four-bedroom  
wooden frame dwelling the Rays had built, so ``we decided to stay 
and fight,'' Ray's mother, Margaret, recalled in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The cottage had been in the family for four generations and  
young Ray's father, an Army colonel with two tours of duty in the 
Vietnam War, had spent every summer of his boyhood there. The Ray 
brothers eventually won the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray's parents and his brother were among the family members on  
hand at the federal courthouse Monday for his private swearing-in 
ceremony before one of the appeals court judges who selected him as 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courthouse, Ray promised his prosecutors would  
operate in ``a prompt, responsible and cost-effective manner,'' 
while being ``thorough and fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray has two investigative matters remaining that the Justice  
Department declined to accept because of potential conflicts of 
interest: 
</P>
<P>
	--An alleged attempt by Maryland developer and Democratic Party  
supporter Nathan Landow to influence the testimony of presidential 
accuser Kathleen Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	--Possible false statements regarding Hillary Rodham Clinton's  
role in the purge of the White House travel office just after the 
start of her husband's term. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray's biggest task could turn out to be the requirement that he  
write a final report on the wide-ranging Starr investigation that 
has delved into fraudulent land deals in Arkansas, including a 
development south of Little Rock called Castle Grande on which Mrs. 
Clinton engaged in legal work. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray was part of the legal team that obtained a felony plea from  
Webster Hubbell, the former law partner of Mrs. Clinton and at one 
time the No. 3 official in the Justice Department, on a charge of 
concealing his and Mrs. Clinton's work on Castle Grande. Hubbell 
says he knows of no wrongdoing by Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The contents of any final report would deal in part with Castle  
Grande, which could cause political trouble for the first lady in 
her run for the U.S. Senate from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In saving the family cottage, Ray showed the same tenacity he  
displayed in his first independent counsel investigation -- pursuing 
a lobbyist and a Tyson Foods executive involved in the probe of 
allegedly illegal gifts to Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Espy case in which the former Clinton Cabinet official was  
acquitted is one of the few losses Ray has been associated with. 
Ray persevered in the cases against the lobbyist and the company 
executive, eventually prevailing. The judge set aside guilty 
verdicts against the lobbyist and overturned guilty verdicts 
against the company executive. The lobbyist was convicted in a 
retrial and one of the Tyson executive's convictions was reinstated 
on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on his work in the Espy probe, Clinton supporters began  
questioning Ray's impartiality as soon as word leaked out last week 
that he was to finish up Starr's five-year probe of the president 
and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats may have trouble using the same argument that they  
used with Starr -- that he is a right-wing zealot out to get the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Until January 1998, Ray was a registered Democrat in New York  
City. He ran twice for the school board in New York City in 
nonpartisan elections, losing both times. He now is a registered 
voter in New Jersey unaffiliated with any political party. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray in recent years made four donations totaling $90 in support  
of Republicans -- three to then-Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and one to the 
Republican National Committee.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Marks World Food Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Eradicating world hunger will depend on  
getting young people interested in agricultural programs and 
convincing more of them to become farmers, U.N. officials said 
Tuesday at a ceremony marking World Food Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Countries that battle harsh climates, civil strife and hazards  
such as land mines continue to suffer the worst malnutrition in the 
world, said Jacques Diouf, director-general of the U.N. Food and 
Agriculture Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the World Food Day ceremony on the theme ``Youth  
Against Hunger,'' Diouf said that his group can't stop wars, but it 
can try to mobilize young people to recognize the importance of 
feeding a global population that has topped 6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Young people of all social backgrounds can and must play a  
role in reducing hunger and malnutrition,'' Diouf said. ``We have 
an estimated 472 million youths, ages 15 to 24, living in rural 
areas. But young people hold agricultural work in low esteem. They 
equate it with hard labor. We must work to change this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many young people have fled the farmlands for the ``bright  
lights'' of the city, and with the exodus has come a drain of 
resources, Diouf said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people suffering from chronic hunger has fallen by  
40 million since the early 1990s, but most of the decline came in 
just 37 countries, while much of the developing world saw hunger 
rise, the FAO said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said the number of people suffering from chronic  
hunger fell to 790 million in 1995-97 -- still a long way from the 
goal set by 186 nations at the 1996 World Food Summit to halve 
world hunger to 400 million by 2015. 
</P>
<P>
	``That decline represents achievements in some 37 countries but  
the actual number of malnourished people has increased worldwide,'' 
said Italy's U.N. Ambassador Paolo Fulci, president of the U.N. 
Economic and Social Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``Enough is enough,'' he said. ``We have the resources and we  
can reverse the change but yet people are still going hungry,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also speaking at Tuesday's ceremony was M.S. Swaminathan,  
architect of India's ``Green Revolution,'' a movement that cut the 
country's dependence on food aid by boosting agricultural and 
community programs. 
</P>
<P>
	He said environmentally sound programs could get youth  
interested in agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Youth will only become interested in farming if it becomes  
intellectually satisfying and economically rewarding,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Springsteen Late for L.A. Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bruce Springsteen took the stage an hour late  
for the first public concert at the Staples Center, but few fans 
seemed to care. 
</P>
<P>
	Springsteen joked with the audience Sunday that when he first  
arrived he thought he was playing at an office supplies store. And 
he quipped: ``The water pressure in the shower backstage, for what 
they paid for it, is not what it should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The concert was the first event in the 20,000-seat arena, which  
was built in a year and a half by construction crews working 18 
hours a day, six days a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he was playing at the House of Pancakes, it wouldn't  
matter,'' said Debbie Steinberg of Los Angeles, who was wearing a 
Springsteen tour shirt. ``I think he's one of the best live 
performers of the century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I really wanted to come and see Springsteen tonight,'' Robyn  
Morningstar said. ``I'm going to see Ricky Martin here later, but 
I'm glad he's not the one opening it.''

<HEADLINE> Frozen Pork Bellies Climb  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Coming off a day of profit-taking, frozen pork belly futures  
prices continued to climb Tuesday on the Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange, while prices on the fresh market even surpassed pork 
loins and other traditionally pricier cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, wheat futures prices were up, while corn and  
soybean futures fell on the Chicago Board of Trade. Gold futures 
also fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The meat market has been healthier overall, boosted by a good  
economy and the inclusion of meat in the U.S. food aid package to 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	But some analysts say there appears to be something else --  
something that's pushing pork belly prices higher in a post-summer 
season when they traditionally take a dive. 
</P>
<P>
	Could it be that bacon is trendy?  
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly seems to be,'' said Dan Vaught, livestock  
analyst, A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	For one, three fast-food chains -- Burger King, Wendy's and Jack  
in the Box -- have all introduced new sandwiches featuring bacon. 
</P>
<P>
	He also points to high-protein diets that have sent shoppers who  
normally avoid items like bacon to the meat and cheese aisles. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, fresh pork bellies have been flirting with the  
80-cent-a-pound mark, while regular untrimmed pork loins have been 
in the low 70s. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaught called that a ``real shock.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot find a time when pork belly prices were over the  
regular loin price and that is the case at the moment,'' Vaught 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Tuesday, February frozen pork bellies rose the limit  
3 cents to 66.02 cents a pound and December lean hogs were up 1.75 
cents to 48.97 a pound. December live cattle also rose .40 cent to 
70.27 cents a pound, and November feeder cattle rose .23 cent to 
82.60 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, wheat futures prices settled up, while soybean and  
corn futures finished mostly lower in trading Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasts for dry weather in the southern Plains and Pacific  
Northwest buoyed wheat futures prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's enough to give a boost out of the doldrums,'' said Don  
Roose, president of Iowa-based U.S. Commodities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, corn futures were pressured by news of an  
ahead-of-schedule harvest. And soybean futures dropped on forecasts 
for rain in drought-plagued northern Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 2 3/4 cents to $2.63 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1 1/4 cent to $2.01 a bushel; December oats fell 3/4 
cent to $1.09 1/2 a bushel; and November soybeans dropped 1/4 cent to 
$4.94 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures fell as the  
dollar rallied against the euro and Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	After dropping to an 18-day low of $306.20 at one point,  
December gold recovered somewhat to finish down $2.20 to $309.50 an 
ounce.

<HEADLINE> FSU's Warrick Could Play Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida State's Peter Warrick could  
play Saturday against Clemson in a deal that would send him to jail 
for a month early next year, the star receiver's lawyer said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick was considered the leading candidate for the Heisman  
Trophy when he was suspended Oct. 7 following his arrest on a 
felony grand theft charge. He has missed the top-ranked Seminoles' 
last two games. 
</P>
<P>
	That could change Wednesday if Circuit Court Judge John Crusoe  
accepts a plea agreement reached by Warrick lawyer John Kenny and 
the Leon County state attorney to reduce the charge to petty theft 
-- a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State athletic director Dave Hart Jr. wouldn't comment  
Tuesday, preferring to wait until Crusoe acts on the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick and former teammate Laveranues Coles were charged with  
buying more than $400 of designer clothes Sept. 29 for $21.40 from 
a store clerk, who is also charged. A security camera recorded the 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement would require Warrick spend 30 days in jail,  
donate to charity clothing he acquired in three trips to a 
Dillard's store, pay $295 in court costs, stay away from the 
department store and serve a year's probation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted the 30 days to offer a misdemeanor,'' Kenny said  
Tuesday. ``That's pretty standard when looking at felony cases. 
They worked very hard to look at Mr. Warrick not as a football 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick could have avoided jail time, but not if he wanted to  
have a shot at playing again this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked at the options of going to trial to prove it was a  
petty theft, but those are not viable options when Peter wants to 
make himself available to the university as quickly as possible,'' 
Kenny said. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick caught 36 passes for 508 yards and four touchdowns in  
Florida State's first five games. He also threw a touchdown pass, 
ran back a punt for another and ran from scrimmage for a TD. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State (7-0, 3-0 ACC) visits Clemson (3-3, 3-1) in the  
first father-son matchup in Division I-A history as Bobby Bowden 
coaches against his son, Tommy. Also, the elder Bowden is trying to 
become just the fifth major college coach to win 300 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick totaled 372 all-purpose yards and scored three  
touchdowns at Clemson two years ago in a 35-28 win. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether he is able to return for Bowden's bid for 300 depends on  
Crusoe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The judge still needs to accept it,'' Kenny said Tuesday. ``I  
anticipate he will. It's a fair resolution for the state attorney's 
office and the best resolution for Peter to give him the greatest 
possibility for the university reinstating him and allowing him to 
play football. Now it's in their corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State does not let its athletes compete if they have  
been charged with a felony. However, Bobby Bowden said Sunday his 
star player has already paid plenty for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how much you have to give up,'' Bowden said.  
``Given up the Heisman ... given up two games ... your future 
opportunities have been hampered. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did wrong,'' Bowden continued. ``There are a lot of ways to  
punish people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Attorney Willie Meggs did not want to comment on the  
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there has been no agreement yet in the cases against  
Coles and the store clerk. Coles was kicked off the team when 
arrested. He was on probation at the beginning of the season for 
other violations of team rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Meggs said Warrick's case did not receive special treatment by  
his office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We resolve probably about 40 percent of our cases within 30  
days of the arrest,'' he said. ``So this is right in the middle of 
the pack.''

<HEADLINE> Travolta May Star in Lottery Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- The number 666 is coming up again.  
</P>
<P>
	A movie is in the works about the scandal that resulted from a  
fixed Pennsylvania Lottery drawing of 666 in the Daily Number game 
in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	John Travolta may star in ``Numbers,'' which could begin filming  
next month. Nora Ephron is directing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my understanding that it's going to be sort of a humorous  
look at the lottery or lotteries in general,'' Pennsylvania Lottery 
spokeswoman Sally Danyluk said Monday. ``I don't think we'll ever 
laugh about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fixed drawing paid $3.8 million, a record high at the time,  
to a total of eight people. A lottery district manager and the 
announcer of the televised drawing were sent to prison.

<HEADLINE> Health Clubs Await Seniors' Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The typical scene at your neighborhood health  
club probably includes pulsating music, hard-bodied women and young 
men with biceps the size of cantaloupes. 
</P>
<P>
	That may soon change, thanks to the graying of America.  
</P>
<P>
	As the first baby boomers close in on retirement, the $9.6  
billion-a-year fitness industry is slowly but surely starting to 
plan for a seniors' fitness boom. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many more people from older generations are working out,''  
said Jack LaLanne, the original TV exercise guru, who still has 
15-inch biceps and can do fingertip pushups at age 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Still largely an afterthought for most clubs, older Americans  
are living longer than ever and have more money than the 18- to 
35-year-olds targeted most often by gyms. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people 55 and older who exercise frequently soared  
75 percent from 1987 to 1996, to 14.2 million, according to a 
report by American Sports Data Research. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's more awareness of the senior market,'' said Terence  
Moffatt, editor in chief of Club Industry, a fitness industry trade 
magazine. ``The challenge is how to integrate a softer, toned-down 
setting for seniors into an existing club with a traditional 
environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem: The iron-pumping, body-beautiful scene can  
intimidate seniors whose goals might be as simple as to become fit 
enough to lift a grandchild or climb a staircase without getting 
out of breath. 
</P>
<P>
	Ly Hotchkin, 75, and two older friends from the Chicago suburb  
of Burr Ridge, exercise together at a community center to the 
sounds of Glenn Miller. They aren't keen on working out at a 
traditional fitness center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't want to go into a club where girls in their little  
bikinis are working out. It's very discouraging to see those young 
bodies,'' she admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Some health clubs have opened separate areas for 50-and-overs  
where easy-listening music is played softly and the atmosphere is 
less aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
	A small handful of suppliers pitch fitness equipment for  
seniors, including strength training gear that uses pneumatic 
cylinders for resistance instead of iron weights that some find 
hard to lift. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the economy flourishing and the pump-you-up industry  
prospering, most clubs are content to cater to the traditional 
clientele -- for now. 
</P>
<P>
	That was evident at last week's national fitness industry  
convention, where pounding rock 'n' roll sounded from numerous 
booths and svelte young fitness buffs plugged high-tech, 
high-energy equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a couple of companies in the vast hall focused their sales  
pitches on the aging, including Fresno, Calif.-based Keiser Corp. 
and Ann Arbor, Mich.-based NuStep Inc., which used Hotchkin and her 
friends to demonstrate workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to change the mindset that this is an industry for  
the young,'' said Colin Milner, vice president of Keiser, a pioneer 
in providing equipment exclusively for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	A health club can fare well these days just by succeeding with  
the under-35 group, Milner acknowledged. But those who ignore the 
population trend will be left behind, he contended, noting that by 
2010 the number of 55- to 74-year-olds will outnumber 25- to 
34-year-olds by 18 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you have to do is look at the demographics,'' he said.  
``There's this whole wave coming at you, and either you learn to 
swim in it or you get swept away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Rose, a 55-year-old physician, is among those at the  
front of the wave. A former runner who gave up sprinting due to 
worsening back pain, he appreciates his club's addition of 
equipment that has less impact on aging bones and joints. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more I can do that's low impact, the better,'' he said  
during a workout at his club in suburban Wilmette. 
</P>
<P>
	Moffatt, the editor, said that if traditional clubs don't  
embrace the seniors market soon, a slew of seniors-only facilities 
will emerge. 
</P>
<P>
	``The elderly are different from the days when people used to  
sit around in rocking chairs,'' said Mary Scott, 84, who wore a 
bright blue workout suit. ``Now we live longer and we like to 
travel, and you've got to be in good shape to travel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our generation,'' she said, ``is getting into it.''

<HEADLINE> Formula One Championship Up in Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- This year's Formula One champion will be decided  
off the track. 
</P>
<P>
	Mika Hakkinen appeared to win the title for the second straight  
year on Sunday, when he was awarded victory in the Malaysian Grand 
Prix after two Ferrari drivers who finished ahead of him were 
disqualified following the race. 
</P>
<P>
	However, that ruling could be overturned by auto racing's  
governing body Friday in Paris. The organization will rule on 
Ferrari's appeal of the decision that gave the title to Hakkinen, a 
Finnish driver for McLaren. 
</P>
<P>
	In an usual twist, Hakkinen and McLaren boss Ron Dennis are  
supporting their rival's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``They won the race fair and square on the track,'' Hakkinen  
told the London Evening Standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis agrees with his driver even though his team stands to win  
the constructors title if the International Automobile Federation 
upholds the disqualifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the way to win a championship, '' Dennis said.  
``It is bad for the sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Irvine, battling Hakkinen for the title, won the race, and  
two-time series champion Michael Schumacher was second in the other 
Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
	But a side deflector panel was found to violate regulations by a  
fraction of an inch. The immediate result was a 12-point advantage 
for Hakkinen, who finished third on the track, an insurmountable 
margin with only the Japanese Grand Prix remaining on Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari general manager Jean Todt offered to resign Monday, but  
Ferrari rejected the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take the blame completely,'' Todt said, conceding the panels  
were irregular but ``did not give us any advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We maintain that the punishment -- double disqualification --  
does not fit the crime,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Todt was baffled by the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``This car has been scrutinized every day here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone said the decision to  
disqualify the Ferrari drivers was ``nonsense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is bad for the sport,'' said Ecclestone, president of  
Formula One Administration and vice president of motor racing's 
world governing body FIA. ``The public wants to see a great finish 
to a great championship. It is a shame if the world championship 
could be decided by someone quite junior who has made a mistake in 
the factory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen needed to win the Malaysian GP -- with Irvine fifth or  
worse -- to retain the title. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the Ferrari victory stood, Irvine would be leading Hakkinen  
70-66. As of now, Hakkinen has clinched the title, 72-60, with a 
victory worth 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
	In Germany, Schumacher's manager, Willi Weber, said he was sure  
Ferrari did not knowingly break any rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ferrari is a team that never had any infractions before,'' he  
said. ``Perhaps the manufacturer of this part made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	FIA's appeals court is made up of 15 judges from around the  
world, and at least three are needed to hear a case. The judges are 
experienced lawyers or judges with auto racing backgrounds and no 
longer involved in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari said it will contend that the infraction did not give  
drivers an advantage, and the same deflector panel had been used at 
previous races without being ruled illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the first time Irvine or Schumacher has been  
punished by FIA. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine was suspended from three races in 1995 after causing a  
crash in the Brazilian GP. Schumacher got a two-race suspension for 
infractions during the British GP. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Schumacher, then with Benetton, was disqualified from  
the Belgian Grand Prix on a technical violation when a wooden board 
underneath the car was judged too low. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher broke his leg at the British Grand Prix on July 11,  
and Sunday's race marked his return to racing.

<HEADLINE> Rockies, Bell Discuss Opening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Colorado Rockies met with Buddy Bell for the  
second day Tuesday, attempting to finalize a contract that would 
make him the third manager in the team's seven-year team history. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, who managed the Detroit Tigers from 1996-98, met with  
Rockies general manager Dan O'Dowd on Monday and Tuesday. He has 
been considered the favorite to succeed Jim Leyland, who retired at 
the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process is continuing until we can agree on terms that are  
mutually agreeable to both parties,'' O'Dowd said. ``Buddy Bell is 
definitely a candidate -- someone on top of the list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contacted Tuesday afternoon, Bell said, ``I haven't accepted the  
job, and they haven't offered it to me either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, who played 18 seasons with four major league teams,  
compiled a 184-277 record as Detroit's manager before being fired 
in September 1998, with three years left on his annual $550,000 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell previously was bench coach for the Cleveland Indians from  
1994-95. He spent this year as the minor league director for the 
Cincinnati Reds, one of his former teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies were reportedly set to introduce Bell as their  
manager Wednesday, but no formal news conference had been scheduled 
as of Tuesday afternoon, a team spokesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
	One negotiating hangup could be Bell's willingness to move from  
his home in Cincinnati. The Rockies want to avoid a repeat of this 
summer when Leyland lived in the Colorado clubhouse while his 
family stayed in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said Monday he is fond of Cincinnati but ``you have to move  
on sometime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before meeting formally with Bell, O'Dowd held interviews with  
several other candidates, including Arizona Diamondbacks bench 
coach Carlos Tosca, Cincinnati coach Ken Griffey and Florida 
Marlins minor league manager Lynn Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dowd also spoke with New York Yankees coach Willie Randolph by  
phone. Randolph did not travel to Denver because the Yankees were 
playing in the American League championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies began searching for a manager after Leyland retired  
with two years left on a three-year, $6 million deal. Leyland, who 
led Colorado to a disappointing 72-90 record, could remain with the 
team in a lesser role. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta Braves hitting coach Don Baylor managed the Rockies from  
their inception in 1993 until he was fired after the 1998 season.

<HEADLINE> NYC's AIDS Background Checks Halted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York City can't require people with the  
AIDS virus to go through special personal and medical background 
checks to receive welfare benefits, the state's highest court ruled 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's ``eligibility verification review,'' established in  
1995, cannot be used as a potential hurdle to welfare benefits, the 
Court of Appeals said in a unanimous opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said a 1997 ordinance approved by the City Council  
requires the city to make things as easy as possible for people 
with AIDS or HIV to get public assistance, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the review process, the city requires welfare recipients  
to apply for benefits in their home boroughs in addition to a 
separate appearance for the eligibility review. The EVR process 
allows city inspectors to make home visits to collect further 
information from recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	AIDS advocates said the eligibility reviews were onerous to  
people who are ill and often in need of immediate eligibility for 
welfare so they can get medical treatment or food. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main goal of the review is to remove people from the rolls  
and to save the city dollars,'' Joe Pressley of the New York AIDS 
Coalition said Tuesday. ``Unfortunately, these services are vitally 
important to many people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Debra Sproles, a spokeswoman for the city's Human Resources  
Administration, said the EVR program was never intended to make it 
difficult for ill people to receive welfare benefits but to verify 
eligibility and weed out fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Kink, a spokesman for Housing Works, which represented  
HIV-infected people in a lawsuit, said Tuesday's ruling could be 
used to eliminate EVRs for all disabled people getting welfare 
benefits in New York City.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Jump 0.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inflation at the consumer level jumped 0.4  
percent in September, the biggest increase in five months, 
reflecting sharply higher prices for gasoline, cigarettes and 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said last month's increase in the Consumer  
Price Index, the government's most closely watched inflation gauge, 
followed a 0.3 percent rise in August. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, consumer prices have been rising at an annual  
rate of 2.8 percent, sharply higher than the tiny 1.6 percent 
increase in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The faster pace of inflation will mean a bigger cost of living  
increase for the 44.2 million Americans getting Social Security 
checks, who will see their benefits rise by 2.4 percent starting in 
January, nearly double the 1.3 percent increase they received this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But rising worries about inflation have set off alarm bells on  
Wall Street with investors concerned that the Federal Reserve will 
be forced to raise interest rates again at their next meeting on 
Nov. 16. The Fed has already boosted borrowing costs twice this 
year in an effort to keep the economy from overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report today, the Commerce Department said that  
construction on new homes and apartments fell by 3.2 percent in 
September, the second monthly decline, as the impact of rising 
mortgage rates and Hurricane Floyd dampened activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline, which was bigger than had been expected, pushed  
housing construction down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
1.62 million units. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan contributed to investor  
unease last week by warning that banks and other lenders need to 
make sure they are prepared for the possibility of a ``bursting 
bubble'' of stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of last week, stock prices were down by the biggest  
amount in a decade, a slide that was hastened on Friday by the 
government's report that prices at the wholesale level shot up 1.1 
percent in September, the biggest gain in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	The 0.4 percent gain in prices charged consumers at the retail  
level was the biggest increase since a 0.7 percent spurt in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The acceleration in inflation this year has come from energy  
costs, which through September have been rising at an annual rate 
of 16.1 percent, compared to a decline of 8.8 percent for all of 
1998, a year in which the Asian currency crisis cut sharply into 
global demand for crude oil.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Halts Smog Fee Collection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis has ordered the state  
to stop collecting the $300-per-vehicle fee levied on hundreds of 
thousands of drivers when they move to California from other 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversial fee, ruled unconstitutional by a state appeals  
court, has generated about $550 million in revenue since it was 
imposed in September 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	About 500 drivers a day have asked the state for refunds since  
the Oct. 4 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis ordered the Department of Motor Vehicles to suspend fee  
collections beginning Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He also ordered two of his top advisers to prepare an analysis  
of the ruling by the 3rd District Court of Appeal, which said the 
fee unconstitutionally interfered with interstate commerce. The 
governor has until Nov. 10 to decide whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Called a ``smog-impact fee,'' the one-time levy has been imposed  
on new California residents when they register their cars in the 
state. The fee has been collected in addition to the standard 
registration costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1990 and 1998, money from the fee was not set aside for  
programs dealing with vehicles, roads or air quality. Rather, it 
was sent directly into California's General Fund, the main state 
coffer that includes sales, corporation, insurance and other taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	In July 1998, following a lower court ruling that said the fee  
was improper, the money was shifted to an account to help 
low-income drivers defray the costs of the repairs needed to bring 
their vehicles into compliance with the state's anti-pollution 
laws.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Profits Rise 30 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. profits jumped 30 percent in the  
first quarter, thanks to strong demand for personal computers 
equipped with its Windows operating system and for the company's 
Office 2000 and other business software. 
</P>
<P>
	The results announced after markets closed Tuesday easily beat  
Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redmond, Wash.-based company reported net earnings of $2.19  
billion or 40 cents a share for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 
compared with profits of $1.68 billion or 31 cents a share a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Not counting a gain of $156 million from the sale of the city  
entertainment guide portion of the MSN Sidewalk online guide, 
Microsoft earned 38 cents a share for the three months ended Sept. 
30. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had projected 
earnings of 34 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterly revenue rose 28 percent, from $4.19 billion to $5.38  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Maffei, chief financial officer, said there was healthy  
corporate demand for Office 2000, the latest version of the suite 
of business applications introduced in June. Sales of Windows NT 
Server and BackOffice software also did well. 
</P>
<P>
	He told analysts in a conference call that he expects a strong  
second quarter with brisk holiday sales, more demand for Office 
2000 and even some year-end spending by corporate computer managers 
who have gotten their Year 2000 plans squared away. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, Maffei had cautioned that sales could be off as  
companies devoted all their resources to stomping out 21st century 
computer bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, ``We don't see a massive deterioration of business,''  
he said. ``We expect that Y2K is not going to be a major problem 
any more than it has been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of personal computers continued to grow, especially in  
Asia, and Microsoft expects that trend to stretch into the December 
quarter, he said. Microsoft's Windows operating system is shipped 
on about 90 percent of all personal computers sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue from Asia climbed 82 percent to $593 million, because of  
the region's improved economy and the launch of localized versions 
of Office 2000, particularly in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very pleased with the results in Asia,'' said Carla  
Lewis, director of investor relations. ``That seems to be 
definitely coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for new PCs has stayed strong, even as competition and  
pricing pressures among computer makers has intensified, Lewis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from Microsoft's Windows products grew 17 percent to  
$2.25 billion in the quarter, thanks to strong increases in the 
number of programs shipped with new computers. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped offset less revenue from retail packaged versions of  
Windows 98, the operating system for home and small business 
computers. Retail demand for Windows 98 was especially strong last 
year, when the product was launched in June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft still plans to begin manufacturing final versions of  
its long-delayed Windows 2000 operating systems for business and 
corporate use by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Maffei would not give a definite shipping date and told analysts  
not to expect significant revenues from Windows 2000 until after 
the middle of next year.

<HEADLINE> Wacky End to Cowboys-Giants Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- New York Giants coach Jim Fassel's  
memories of ``The Play'' nearly resulted in ``The Play II.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Cowboys came oh so close Monday night to duplicating  
Cal's lateral-filled kickoff return for a touchdown against 
Stanford in 1982, only to be foiled when a forward lateral 
nullified the play. 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel, an assistant on that losing Stanford team, wanted to  
squib the kickoff, but special teams coach Larry Mac Duff convinced 
him to let Brad Daluiso kick high and short. That would allow the 
defenders to get downfield to cover Deion Sanders more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in '82, Stanford squibbed the ball with disastrous results.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing that was going through my mind was that I was  
in Stanford for that Stanford-Cal fiasco through the band and 
everything else,'' Fassel said. ``We on-sided that one and that was 
all I could visualize right there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monday night's game ended with the Giants winning 13-10, but  
Daluiso tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee trying 
to make a tackle at the Giants 15. He will be lost for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second time this type of play has had a nightmarish  
ending for Fassel. The Giants coach was a member of Stanford 
coaching staff in 1982 when California used a slew of laterals to 
return a squib kick for a game-winning TD, with the final 20 yards 
or so being run through the Cardinal band. 
</P>
<P>
	That memory influenced Fassel's decision on the kickoff after  
Daluiso kicked a go-ahead 21-yard field goal with one second to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	So Daluiso popped it up, but he hit it too far, right to Sanders  
at the Cowboys 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kicked it too deep,'' Daluiso said. ``I even told the guys  
on the field that I was going to pop it up even shorter than 
normal. My only fear was they would fair catch it and take a free 
kick and tie the game. It went a little too far, the adrenaline was 
flowing and they broke it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders fielded the ball, broke to his right and then reversed  
his field. With Giants defenders closing in at around the 25-yard 
line, Sanders tossed the ball to Kevin Mathis, but the ball clearly 
was a yard or two forward and a yellow flag was thrown for a 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was close, it could have gone either way,'' Sanders said.  
``That was so pretty, you got to let that go. It was good for the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mathis kept going, sprinting into the clear with a cut across  
the field from left to right. The only one standing in his way was 
Daluiso. He attempted to make tackle around the New York 15, but 
Mathis lateraled to Singor Mobley, who completed the run to the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Daluiso wrapped his arms around Mathis and fell to the ground in  
pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw the flag,'' Daluiso said. ``I could have said: `I'll  
take my chances and let the guy go.' But I had to try. Obviously, 
tackling isn't my forte. I'll come back stronger than I was this 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daluiso felt his cleats caught in the turf. He said his  
side-to-side mobility has decreased in recent years because kicking 
doesn't involve much of that. 
</P>
<P>
	He hobbled off the field as the Giants celebrated their win.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fine,'' Daluiso said. ``They told me I tore my ACL.  
We'll know more tomorrow. This is all new to me. I have never been 
hurt. Makes me feel kind of tough. I feel like I'm a little bit of 
a football player. I guarantee I looked kind of clumsy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daluiso entered this season as the Giants career leader in  
field-goal accuracy (77.3 percent). He was 7-of-9 on field goals 
this season, including 2-of-2 against the Cowboys. His kickoffs 
were also among the best in the league, with seven of his 18 going 
for touchbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge loss,'' Giants punter Brad Maynard said. ``John  
Mara (Giants executive vice president) just said he felt like we 
lost the game. We won the game, but we lost a key player for 
sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Fassel, it also felt like another loss, just like it did 17  
years ago when Cal lateraled its way to a 25-20 win through the 
band.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Thinks He Can Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan, the Republican presidential  
candidate who plans to join the Reform Party next week, said 
Tuesday night he could win the presidency if he were allowed into a 
three-way debate with the Republican and Democratic nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan told reporters and conservatives at a party promoting  
his new book that he still had not reached a final decision. Close 
advisers, however, say Buchanan intends to announce Monday that he 
is breaking with the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I get into the race, my determination will be to get into  
the debates, and if I get into a free-wheeling forum ... I think I 
can become the president of the United States because I think it is 
a volatile election and I think voters would see an agenda that is 
new and different'' from the Democratic and Republican 
alternatives, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan asserted that the major parties would be forced to  
allow him into the debates if he was securing more than 15 
percentage points in national presidential polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they tried to keep me out of the debates that would  
underscore my point that I will be making about the two party 
system, which is that it's just a sham,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan also said he would not be intimidated by the wealth of  
New York tycoon Donald Trump, who also is considering a Reform 
Party presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans fear a third-party run by Buchanan would siphon  
conservative votes away from their nominee. He won the New 
Hampshire primary in 1996 and, in 1992, put a scare into 
then-President George Bush, father of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, 
the front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But Buchanan would not be assured the Reform Party nomination.  
Aside from Trump, a cast of celebrities and politicians are 
mentioned as possible candidates, including Minnesota Gov. Jesse 
Ventura, actors Cybill Shepherd and Warren Beatty, and party 
founder Ross Perot. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan plans to make announcements Monday in suburban  
Virginia, New Hampshire and Tuesday in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	His new book, ``A Republic, Not an Empire,'' has stirred  
controversy because of his claim that Nazi Germany was not a threat 
to the United States after 1940.

<HEADLINE> Angels Appear Close To Hiring GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The Anaheim Angels have interviewed  
former New York Yankees general manager Bob Watson and longtime 
Montreal Expos executive Bill Stoneman twice each for their vacant 
GM position, a team spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Mead, the Angels' vice president of communications, said  
Omar Minaya, assistant general manager with the New York Mets, and 
Tim Purpura, assistant GM with the Houston Astros, have also been 
interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Bavasi resigned after almost six years as Angels general  
manager on Oct. 1, citing philosophical differences with Angels 
president Tony Tavares. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony has narrowed his list, but is playing it close to the  
vest,'' Mead said. ``I know he would like this process to conclude 
as soon as possible in order to proceed with other issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those issues include hiring a manager to succeed Terry Collins,  
who resigned Sept. 3, and a director of player development to 
replace Jeff Parker, who resigned earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	As far as the new manager is concerned, Mead said: ``That's  
going to be the general manager's call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before resigning, Bavasi had spoken with Phil Garner and Don  
Baylor about the managerial job. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner has since been hired as manager of the Detroit Tigers,  
while Baylor remains on the job as batting coach of the Atlanta 
Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels had one of the most disappointing seasons in their  
history this year, finishing 70-92 and in last place in the AL 
West.

<HEADLINE> Miami Hurricanes Eager for a Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- The Miami Hurricanes boarded a bus  
Friday night, rode several miles to a hotel where they were going 
to stay before Saturday's game against Temple, then turned around 
and went back to campus. 
</P>
<P>
	The game had been postponed. So had the team's hopes of ending a  
three-game losing streak, the Hurricanes' second such skid in the 
past 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, several days after Hurricane Irene rambled through South  
Florida, No. 23 Miami (2-3) still is looking for the win it hoped 
would come against the Owls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes have not won since Labor Day weekend, a span of  
more than six weeks. That is their longest midseason winless 
stretch since 1970, leaving coach Butch Davis and his players eager 
to play -- and hopefully beat -- Boston College (5-1) on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The players) are getting edgy to play,'' Davis said Tuesday.  
``It seems like all we've done is practice the last 12 weeks. We 
just need to go play a game, but a win is very important if you're 
going to have any expectations of putting yourself in a position to 
not only qualify for a bowl game but to win the Big East 
Conference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami has yet to play a conference game, beginning the season  
with five nonconference opponents, including Florida State and Penn 
State. The Hurricanes upset Ohio State in the Kickoff Classic and 
hammered Florida A&AMP;M the following week, but then dropped three 
straight, including a blown 21-point lead to East Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	They had hoped to rebound against Temple, but Irene washed out  
any chance of that happening. The game was rescheduled for Dec. 4, 
and Miami treated the postponement as an open date, which gave the 
Hurricanes their third week off since beating Florida A&AMP;M on Sept. 
4. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like forever since we won because of the rainout and  
the three straight losses,'' wide receiver Andre King said. ``But 
we're hungrier and we're looking forward to going to Boston College 
and playing a good game and coming out of there with a victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami expects to beat the Eagles, and it might be justified. The  
Hurricanes have won 17 of their 20 meetings, including nine 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the Eagles beat Miami they needed the last-second  
heroics of quarterback Doug Flutie and receiver Gerard Phelan. That 
1984 game is the most storied in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the teams have had some close games since, Boston College  
had its best chance to beat Miami in 1997, when the Hurricanes 
needed two overtimes to seal a 45-44 win in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami wants to continue its winning streak over the Eagles, and  
in turn, end its three-game slide. 
</P>
<P>
	``In due time, we're going to get our win,'' wide receiver  
Santana Moss said. ``And I think it will be this week.''

<HEADLINE> Few Getting Gov't-Aided Child Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just 15 percent of low- and moderate-income  
children eligible for government-financed child care are getting 
the subsidies, the government reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 9.9 million kids qualify, but just over 1.5 million  
actually got the help last year, said the report released by Donna 
Shalala, secretary of Health and Human Services, who used the 
findings to urge more spending on child care. 
</P>
<P>
	``The clock is ticking for Congress to act,'' she said. ``For  
working parents and their children, there's not a moment to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Participation rates varied considerably across the country, from  
West Virginia, where 45 percent of eligible children were enrolled, 
to Mississippi, with just 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the programs, states offer child-care subsidies on a  
sliding scale, with the aid phasing out as a family's income grows. 
</P>
<P>
	States were slow to begin spending extra money allocated for  
child care in the 1996 welfare overhaul. Now they have spent 
virtually every dollar available, and then some, the HHS report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, states spent $3.5 billion in federal and state money.  
Much of the state spending was required to qualify for federal 
dollars, but states spent $686 million more in welfare money in 
order to help more children. 
</P>
<P>
	In his budget proposal for 2000, President Clinton asked  
Congress for $19 billion over five years in increased child-care 
money. That included more for subsidies and more in tax credits for 
working parents and for parents who forgo a second income to stay 
home with children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children are priceless, and we shouldn't nickel and dime them  
when it comes to providing safe and affordable child care,'' said 
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who joined with Sen. James 
Jeffords, R-Vt., to push for more spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans have shown interest in the tax credits  
but are wary of increased subsidies, noting that subsidies already 
were increased in 1996. They note that many states have excess 
welfare money that can be used for child care. 
</P>
<P>
	``States have plenty of money to spend on child care in the  
coming years as more and more welfare beneficiaries return to work, 
and I'm working on ways to provide even more flexibility to states 
so they can meet this growing need,'' said a statement from Rep. 
Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., chairman of the House Ways and Means 
welfare subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton pushed for major new child-care spending last year, too,  
but none was included in the deal he negotiated with the GOP at the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	This year it will be a priority, said Melissa Skolfield, HHS  
spokeswoman. She said since prospects for a significant overhaul of 
Medicare have fallen, child care will rise as a priority for the 
department and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	In its HHS spending bill, the Senate approved $1 billion in  
increased child-care subsidies, although how to pay for it was 
unclear. The House bill included no new money, and the two bills 
are being reconciled. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal law, any family earning 85 percent of the state's  
median income qualifies for the child-care subsidy, meaning about 
four in 10 families qualify. States can impose tighter 
requirements, and all but nine have. 
</P>
<P>
	That means eligibility rules vary significantly among states.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the report said, a family of three could qualify for  
child care in Connecticut with an income of more than $39,000, but 
in Wyoming, the family's income would have to be less than $16,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Applying the more generous federal rules nationwide, some 14.7  
million children qualify for care. Under this scenario, just 10 
percent are getting help. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first report of its kind, made possible by the Urban  
Institute, a Washington-based policy analysis group that provided 
estimates of the number of children eligible for aid. States 
reported the number actually participating.

<HEADLINE> Bliss Signs Winston Cup Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOORESVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Mike Bliss, a regular in the NASCAR  
Craftsman Truck Series, signed a contract Tuesday to move into the 
Winston Cup series next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bliss will drive Pontiacs for Eel River Racing.  
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was made by Jack Birmingham, who bought Bahari  
Racing on July 28 and renamed it. Birmingham fired driver Derrike 
Cope after the race at Indianapolis in early August and has since 
filled in with Todd Bodine and Bliss. 
</P>
<P>
	Bliss drove the team car earlier this month at Martinsville,  
Va., finishing 32nd in his Winston Cup debut. He'll return to the 
team for Sunday's race at Rockingham, N.C. and is also scheduled to 
drive at Phoenix and Homestead, Fla. The team hasn't announced a 
driver for the season finale at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Bliss rejoins Barry Dodson, his crew chief for six of his seven  
victories on the truck circuit. Dodson is crew chief and a part 
owner of the Eel River Racing team.

<HEADLINE> PSC Head Backs Bell Atlantic Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Bell Atlantic's bid to become the first  
regional Bell to tap the long distance market cleared a major 
hurdle Tuesday when it won the suppport of New York state's top 
utility regulator. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking before federal regulators, state Public Service  
Commission Chairwoman Maureen Helmer testified that the company 
complies federal laws requiring it to first open its doors to 
competition in the local market before branching into long-distance 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic, the nation's largest local phone company, serves  
the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states. It filed its application to 
be a long-distance carrier with the Federal Communications 
Commission on Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission had asked Helmer for confirmation on whether  
there is open competition in New York when deciding on Bell 
Atlantic's application. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal decision is expected around the end of the year, at  
which point Bell Atlantic could be the first regional Bell company 
to offer long-distance service to its local customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company would deliver long-distance service over its  
existing network of phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic's chief operating officer, James Cullen, said the  
state's support has made him ``very confident'' about getting FCC 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a great deal more optimistic,'' Cullen said. ``This is not  
the end of the line, but it does support PSC's conclusion that 
(local) markets are open and that we should be allowed in the 
long-distance market.''

<HEADLINE> Braves' Rocker Unhurt in Car Wreck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- One day after totaling his sports car in a  
traffic accident, John Rocker was on the mound for the Atlanta 
Braves in the deciding game of the NL Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker pitched two innings Tuesday night against the New York  
Mets, allowing an unearned run, before the Braves clinched the 
series with a 10-9 victory in the 11th inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an extremely stressful week,'' said Rocker, who pitched  
in each of the six game of the series. ``It would have been just as 
nerve-wracking without the car wreck and all that kind of thing. 
But, unfortunately, it happened to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker pitched a perfect ninth and should have gotten through  
the 10th. He had Benny Agbayani picked off, but first baseman Brian 
Hunter's throw hit the runner in the back. Agbayani wound up 
scoring to give the Mets a 9-8 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Braves rallied in the bottom half, as Ozzie Guillen's  
run-scoring single forced another inning and took Rocker off the 
hook. The Braves won the following inning on Andruw Jones' 
bases-loaded walk. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I went out for my second inning, I really didn't have  
much mentally,'' Rocker said. ``I was so mentally exhausted from 
just being in a nail-biting game every single day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker was not injured in the collision with a tractor-trailer  
rig, which occurred Monday on one of Atlanta's busiest highways. 
</P>
<P>
	``It scared him some,'' said his father, Jake Rocker, before  
heading to his seat at Turner Field. ``I'm sure he was thanking the 
good Lord that he didn't look down and see any blood and guts all 
over him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Rocker declined comment prior to Tuesday night's  
game at Turner Field against the New York Mets, avoiding reporters 
by slipping through a back entrance to the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The wreck occurred on an off day in the NLCS. Rocker told police  
and his father that he was traveling 60-65 mph in a 1998 Chevrolet 
Corvette -- a promotional vehicle loaned to him by a local 
dealership -- when another car swerved in front. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker tried to avoid the car and lost control of his own  
vehicle, slamming into the wheels of a tractor-trailer in an 
adjacent lane. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck driver was not injured and there was no damage to his  
vehicle, Jake Rocker said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was charged in the crash, which occurred the day after  
the Braves lost Game 5 to the Mets in the longest postseason game 
in baseball history. The Braves bounced back to win the best-of-7 
series 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Jake Rocker was concerned about the effects of the crash a day  
later, but his son said Tuesday morning in a telephone call that he 
felt fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he feels better now than he did before the wreck,''  
the father said. ``There is no soreness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Braves general manager John Schuerholz described the wreck as a  
``fender bender,'' while manager Bobby Cox said it would have no 
effect on his pitching plans. Rocker has two saves and has worked 
in every game in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I know is it wasn't very bad,'' Cox said.  
``I've been in car wrecks before and, generally, you're so sore you 
can't move for a week. But he's absolutely 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander stirred controversy by calling New York fans  
``stupid,'' and ``a tired act'' before the Braves arrived in New 
York. That made him a target of Mets fans in the three games played 
at Shea Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pitched my best baseball of the year against them,'' said  
Rocker, who had two saves and didn't allow an earned run in 8 2-3 
innings. ``If the Mets fans set out to try to get in my head, they 
didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the bad blood between Rocker and the New York fans, New  
York catcher Mike Piazza was glad to hear no one was injured in the 
wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball is just something we do,'' Piazza said. ``That's life  
and death. From everything I hear, he's OK. He's very fortunate. 
That's the most important thing: he's OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jake Rocker said he hopes his son will reconsider his  
promotional deal with the Chevrolet dealership. The '98 Corvette 
was on loan to the pitcher while his own Corvette was being 
ordered. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to talk to him about not taking the one he's  
ordered,'' Jake Rocker said. ``We need to wrap him up in something 
more substantial. But I don't know if he will. He is 25 years 
old.''

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta Braves reliever John Rocker, who has made

	GOP Filibuster Kills Campaign Finance Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to overhaul the nation's campaign  
finance laws fell to a Republican filibuster for the fourth 
straight year today, despite concessions by supporters designed to 
build fresh momentum for the measure. The bill's fate was sealed 
when the Senate twice fell short of the 60-vote majority needed to 
overcome the filibuster. All 45 Senate Democrats supported both 
efforts to free the measure, joined by a shifting group of 
Republicans. 

</P>
<P>
	Social Security Checks To Increase  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retirees will get the biggest cost-of-living  
increase in their Social Security checks that they've seen in three 
years -- an average $19 a month -- beginning in January. The 2.4 
percent benefits boost, announced by the Social Security 
Administration today, will be nearly twice the 1.3 percent increase 
senior citizens got this year, largely because of a recent spike in 
energy prices. 

</P>
<P>
	Gore Wants Clinton To Campaign  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite earlier comments that he was  
considering declining the president's help, Vice President Al Gore 
today told Congressional Progressive Caucus members that President 
Clinton will campaign on behalf of his White House bid. Gore told 
the Washington Post last week he considered the campaign a ``very 
personal quest'' and indicated that he hadn't decided what role 
Clinton would play. Gore, however, made it clear today that Clinton 
would be involved in the campaign -- but also that he needs to 
maintain his own identity to win. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton, GOP Meet on Budget Impasse  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top Republicans pledged today they would  
reject any budget deal that used Social Security surpluses as they 
headed for White House talks on their spending impasse with 
President Clinton. Clinton and congressional leaders held a late 
afternoon White House meeting on their budget dispute, which has so 
far prevented enactment of eight of the 13 annual spending bills 
for the 19-day-old fiscal year.

	Albright Seeks More Nigeria Aid  
</P>
<P>
	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,  
demonstrating support for Nigeria's return to democracy after 15 
years of dictatorship, recommended Tuesday that U.S. aid be 
increased to Africa's most populous nation as much as four times 
current levels. Nigerian President Olesegun Obasanjo and Albright 
also discussed the possibility of Nigeria extraditing drug lords 
who use the country as a transit point in the flow of Asian heroin 
to the United States.

	Pentagon Reveals Nuclear Weapon Sites  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is acknowledging the locations of  
U.S. nuclear weapons outside the United States during the Cold War. 
The names of nine places where bombs or bomb components minus their 
nuclear charges were located between 1951 and 1977 are revealed in 
a 332-page official Pentagon history. The names of 18 other 
locations were blacked out by government censors before the 
document was released to Robert S. Norris, a private specialist on 
nuclear weapons and author of numerous books on the topic.

	Vitamin E May Lower Smokers' Cancer Risk  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A diet rich in vitamin E foods such as nuts  
and whole grains can lower the risk of lung cancer among smokers by 
about 20 percent, a new study says. In the study of more than 
29,000 male smokers in Finland, researchers found that those who 
had high blood levels of vitamin E, reduced their incidence of lung 
cancer by 19 percent to 23 percent.

	IBM Pulls PCs Out of U.S. Stores  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM said today it will pull its money-losing  
line of PCs from U.S. stores and sell them exclusively over the 
Internet. IBM's Personal Systems Group, which sells PCs to both 
consumers and businesses, lost about $150 million in the second 
quarter and nearly $1 billion last year. IBM, the nation's 
third-largest PC maker, is the latest technology company to be 
squeezed by price wars and a surge in component costs.

Jones industrial average was up 88.65 at 10,204.93, extending its 
gain of 96.57 yesterday. On the NYSE, gainers led losers 
1,618-1,400. Just before the half hour the Nasdaq was down 0.84 at

	FSU's Warrick Could Play Saturday  
</P>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida State's Peter Warrick could  
play Saturday against Clemson in a deal that would send him to jail 
for a month early next year, the star receiver's lawyer said today. 
Warrick was considered the leading candidate for the Heisman Trophy 
when he was suspended Oct. 7 following his arrest on a felony grand 
theft charge.

<HEADLINE> This Time, Jeter Homers Over Fence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Derek Jeter actually homered over the wall this  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter, who needed the help of a 12-year-old fan for his only  
previous home run in an AL Championship Series, put the Yankees 
ahead with a two-run shot just eight pitches into the game Monday 
night, and New York went on to beat the Boston Red Sox 6-1 for 
their third AL pennant in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every year is special,'' Jeter said. ``It never gets old. You  
could write a book about each time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, with the Yankees trailing Baltimore 4-3 in the series  
opener, Jeter hit a fly ball to right that Tony Tarasco settled 
under -- until 12-year-old Jeff Maier reached over the fence and 
snatched it away for a game-tying homer. Bernie Williams' 
11th-inning home run won it, and the Yankees finished off the 
Orioles in five games. 
</P>
<P>
	``That didn't win the game, Bernie won the game,'' Jeter said  
then. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that he didn't appreciate Maier's help and umpire Richie  
Garcia's failure to call fan interference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you. Reach over all you want,'' Jeter said. ``It's just  
something that happens. Sometimes you call it right and sometimes 
you call it wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There wasn't any controversy this time.  
</P>
<P>
	After Chuck Knoblauch's opposite-field single to right on Kent  
Mercker's fourth pitch of the game, Jeter worked the count to 2-1, 
then drove the ball slightly to the left of straightaway center, 
just to the right of the 37-foot-high Green Monster. 
</P>
<P>
	The 410-foot drive sailed over the 17-foot wall in center,  
cutting through a 17 mph northerly wind. 
</P>
<P>
	Up until that point, Jeter had 10 hits in 26 at-bats during the  
playoffs, but just one run batted in. Good for most players, but 
not for him, especially following a regular season in which he hit 
.349 with 24 homers and 102 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	But on this night, he was at the forefront of another chapter in  
the Yankees' century of glory. He's been with them for four 
seasons, and gone to the World Series in three of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a way of life, it seems like, for Derek Jeter since he's  
been in the league,'' teammate Roger Clemens said enviously. ``I'm 
just happy to be going again -- it's been 13 years.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Compares Politics to Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush has said he grew  
up wanting to be Willie Mays and later was part-owner of a major 
league baseball team. Now he's telling children that ``running for 
president is a lot like playing baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the front-runner for the Republican presidential  
nomination says he'll continue to speak out on issues, even if it 
puts him odds with GOP leaders on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush told The Washington Post in an interview in today's  
editions that he is not turning his back on his Hill colleagues, 
but will continue to ``state my opinions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush drew the ire of some Republicans and conservatives earlier  
this month for criticizing a plan by GOP congressional leaders to 
balance the budget by shifting money from a tax credit program for 
the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the party was too often too negative.  
</P>
<P>
	Since challenging the plan for the tax credit program, which  
subsequently was dropped, Bush said he has talked to House Speaker 
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and House Majority Leader Dick Armey and 
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay -- both of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can still be friends and have disagreements on issues,''  
Bush told the Post. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he unveiled a revamped campaign Web site that  
includes a ``youth zone'' where he compares presidential politics 
to one of his passions -- baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The site, which also features a baseball card-style photo of the  
candidate, suggests many similarities between the two. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball players ``must be able to throw, catch and hit the  
ball;'' presidential candidates ``must know about current events 
and important issues, such as education,'' it says. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires enforce baseball rules; politics has the Federal  
Election Commission. Baseball has two leagues; politics has ``two 
large parties, the Republicans and the Democrats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also compares the regular season of baseball to the  
campaigning that candidates engage in before each party choose a 
presidential nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the regular season, baseball teams play each other many  
times. They take road trips to other cities and play at home. 
Candidates running for president in each of the parties also take 
road trips. They visit many different cities where they attend 
rallies, give speeches and meet voters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Primaries are the playoffs and the November 2000 general  
election will be like the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big event,'' the site says. ``The winner of the  
World Series must win four of seven games. In politics, there is 
only one world series game on Election Day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush often has said he grew up wanting to be baseball great  
Willie Mays ``but I couldn't hit a curve ball.'' His office in the 
Texas Capitol is decorated with baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was part of the group that bought the Texas Rangers and was  
managing partner of the team until his first election as governor 
in 1994. Sale of the team last year brought him about $14.9 million 
from his $600,000 investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has used a Web site since launching his presidential  
campaign in March. It now includes Spanish-language features, a 
list of campaign activities in the states and information about his 
contributors and policy proposals.

<HEADLINE> Toronto Bluejays Name New Coaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Toronto Blue Jays on Tuesday hired Rick  
Langford as pitching coach and Roly de Armas as bullpen coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The 47-year-old Langford replaces Mel Queen, who was fired along  
with four other coaches with two days left in the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Under manager Jim Fregosi, who replaced the fired Tim Johnson  
early in spring training, the Blue Jays finished 84-78 and in third 
place in the AL East. 
</P>
<P>
	Langford was Toronto's pitching coach for Class AAA Syracuse  
last season. He has spent four years in the Blue Jays' organization 
and will make his major league debut in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	He pitched 11 seasons for the Oakland Athletics, compiling a  
73-106 record with a 4.01 ERA and 86 complete career games. In 
1980, Langford led the American League with 28 complete games -- 
including 19 in a row -- and threw a 14-inning complete game. 
</P>
<P>
	Langford coached in the Montreal Expos and Pittsburgh Pirates  
organizations before resuming his playing career for one season in 
1988 with the New York Yankees. He returned to coaching, joining 
the Blue Jays in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	De Armas replaces Marty Pevey in the bullpen. The 47-year-old  
was catching co-ordinator and manager of the Arizona Diamondbacks 
rookie team in Tucson, Ariz., this year. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a bullpen catcher for the Chicago White Sox in 1994 and  
1995 and in 1996 was named bullpen coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week the Blue Jays named Cito Gaston as their hitting  
instructor, while also hiring Bobby Knoop as their first base coach 
and Lee Elia as bench coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Bevington returns for another year as third base coach.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Panamanian Leader Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The handoff of the Panama Canal should mark a  
new relationship emphasizing diplomatic and commercial ties over 
military issues, the president of Panama told President Clinton on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two leaders also discussed anti-drug efforts and  
environmental issues in the Oval Office meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	President Mireya Moscoso urged Clinton to attend a ceremony in  
Panama in December to ``solemnize'' the transfer of the canal from 
U.S. to Panamanian control. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscoso said such a ceremony would underscore the beginning of a  
new relationship between the dominant power in the hemisphere and 
Panama, as well as the other nations of Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscoso stressed that this new relationship should emphasize  
diplomatic and commercial ties. She had opposed the establishment 
of a new U.S. drug-fighting base in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want any more bases in our country,'' she said.  
``That wasn't on the agenda. It's not on the agenda of our 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said Clinton said he would consider attending the ceremony  
but offered no assurances. White House officials said it was 
unlikely Clinton would be able to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the two leaders  
discussed ``joint efforts on counternarcotics'' as well as 
environmental issues. The Panamanians are pressing the United 
States about hazards around the bases its soldiers and sailors are 
leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president made the point clearly that we've met our treaty  
obligations of what was practicable to do as far as cleanup. Most 
of the cleanup has been done,'' Lockhart said. ``There are some 
areas that are impossible to get to as far as moving forward, but 
he did say that we wanted to continue to remain engaged and work 
with Panama in an effort to deal with this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Smith, an independent from New Hampshire, criticized  
Clinton for not dealing specifically with concerns about a Chinese 
corporation that will be controlling a canal port or the possible 
incursion by drug traffickers from Colombia into Panamanian 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not silly to be concerned about a Chinese Communist  
company having a foothold in Panama,'' Smith said in a statement. 
``I take our national security very seriously, and it's unfortunate 
that our administration doesn't feel the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a member of the Armed Services Committee, said he would  
hold a hearing on the transfer of the canal Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a treaty signed in 1977, Panama takes control of the canal  
after midnight December 31. The strategic significance of the 
manmade waterway has diminished, but the U.S. bases that control it 
have begun to play a significant role in the war against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Panama rejected the continued presence of the U.S. military.  
While Moscoso guaranteed the security of the canal, she said new 
U.S. anti-drug bases in Panama were not an option. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. presence in Panama is a sensitive topic for Moscoso,  
the widow of a nationalist mayor, Arnulfo Arias, whose fight 
against the American influence in their country became legend in 
Latin America.

<HEADLINE> Foremost Insurance OKs Acquisition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Foremost Corp. of America, the  
nation's leading insurer of mobile homes, has accepted an $812 
million buyout offer from Los Angeles-based Farmers Insurance 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers will pay $29.25 a share for Foremost shares under the  
agreement announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Foremost, based in Grand Rapids, said it holds insurance  
policies covering about 20 percent of the nation's mobile homes. It 
also is a leading insurer of recreational vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers is the third-largest insurer of private automobiles and  
homes in the United States, with 16 million customers and 15,000 
agents nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers is a member of the Zurich Financial Services Group,  
which has annual sales of $45 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers will provide the resources necessary to expand  
Foremost's business, Foremost chairman and chief executive Richard 
L. Antonini said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a product standpoint, there are tremendous synergies to  
this acquisition that could translate into impressive premium 
growth for Foremost for the next several years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin D. Feinstein, Farmers chairman and chief executive, said  
Foremost ``will continue to be the dominant brand name in specialty 
insurance, and we are looking to build on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foremost said it expects to complete the sale in the first  
quarter of 2000. The closing is subject to approval by Foremost 
shareholders and government regulators.

<HEADLINE> Surgery Scheduled for Sam Schmidt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Sam Schmidt, who suffered severe injuries to  
both feet in the Indy Racing League's Mall.com 500 on Sunday, will 
undergo surgery Thursday at Methodist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old driver, who fractured both feet in a collision  
with Scott Sharp at the Texas Motor Speedway, was flown from Dallas 
to Indianapolis on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically the left foot has been completely smashed,''  
Treadway Racing spokeswoman Ruthie Culbertson said. ``They went 
into the left foot and set some of the fractures but they can't 
actually put the pins in until the swelling has gone down, which 
they think will be by Thursday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also during the first operation in Dallas Sunday night, part of  
Schmidt's right big toe was amputated. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt, who finished 22nd in the race, was listed in good  
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing very well,'' Culbertson said. ``He's in a large  
quantity of pain. They had him on a constant morphine drip. He's 
not around (alert) much, which is good.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	READING, Pa. (AP) -- A county judge was beaten unconscious and  
two deputy sheriffs were attacked Tuesday by a suspect angry over 
the prospect of being committed to a state mental hospital, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Linda K.M. Ludgate suffered a broken right forearm, nose  
and facial bone after 38-year-old Derrick J. Neidig rushed the 
bench and attacked her during an afternoon hearing, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ludgate, 57, was hospitalized in fair condition Tuesday night,  
and was expected to undergo surgery Wednesday for her broken arm, 
Judge Scott D. Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deputy sheriffs were treated in the hospital for cuts and  
bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	Neidig, who had been free on bail on a charge of simple assault,  
pounced on Ludgate, put her in a headlock and punched her for about 
30 seconds before anyone came to her aid, witnesses said. Stunned 
onlookers screamed and fled the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was bad, real bad,'' said lawyer James M. Polyak, who told  
The Reading Times that he was punched in the jaw while he helped 
subdue Neidig. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot, 10-inch, 210-pound Neidig was subdued by probation  
officers and police in the seventh-floor courtroom at the Berks 
County courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Neidig was arraigned Tuesday on charges of aggravated assault,  
recklessly endangering another person, resisting arrest and related

<HEADLINE> Kenneth Starr Leaves Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kenneth Starr leaves office with convictions  
against 14 people, plus a presidential impeachment and five years 
worth of controversy. It's the last one, he says, that drove him 
from office. 
</P>
<P>
	His journey as Whitewater independent counsel took Starr from a  
well-respected former solicitor general in the Bush administration, 
one considered a future Supreme Court nominee, to a reviled and 
caricatured figure in the House impeachment drama that ended with 
President Clinton's acquittal in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	In his lawyerly fashion, Starr always defended his conduct and  
his pursuit of the president as one of preserving the ``rule of 
law'' and simply ``gathering the facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But presidential defenders and his detractors painted a  
different portrait -- one that ultimately affected the credibility 
of the investigation. They accused him and his staff of illegally 
leaking grand jury material, suggested he was in cahoots with 
attorneys for Clinton accuser Paula Jones and that he mistreated 
witnesses, including Monica Lewinsky, the former White House 
intern. 
</P>
<P>
	And always they suggested he was a Republican out to get the  
president. 
</P>
<P>
	For all the flak he received, Starr won some major battles. A  
federal appeals court last month issued a ruling in his favor on 
the leaks issue; he convicted the Clintons' business partners in 
the Arkansas land dealings known as Whitewater, forced the 
resignation and conviction of Arkansas' sitting governor, convinced 
the courts of the right to question Secret Service agents and sent 
Congress a referral exposing the sexual relationship between the 
president and Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's voluminous -- and sexually explicit report to the House --  
ultimately led to Clinton's impeachment on perjury and obstruction 
of justice charges. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the key moments of his prosecutorial career, Starr  
testified in House impeachment proceedings. His hand-picked ethics 
adviser, Sam Dash, resigned in protest over Starr becoming an 
``aggressive advocate'' for his impeachment referral. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr noted Monday in his own letter of resignation that in the  
aftermath of the Lewinsky scandal, there had been a drop in public 
confidence in the notion that he would administer justice fairly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wiser course, I believe, is for another individual to head  
the investigation,'' Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a belated realization on his part,'' said St. John's  
University law professor John Barrett. ``I think at some point 
before 1998 began it was clear that Starr had been seriously 
demonized by friends of the people he was investigating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett said Starr simply was not the right kind of prosecutor  
to be an independent counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone with a partisan identity is just not the right kind of  
person for that job,'' Barrett added. ``It should be somebody who 
is past ambition. Somebody past the partisan battles of the day. 
That wasn't Ken Starr in 1994, not in 1997 and not 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One problem Starr encountered in his tenure was that the Justice  
Department kept adding to his mandate and Starr accepted rather 
than urging that someone else handle the matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Did Starr have the power to tell the Justice Department ``no  
thanks'' to investigating the Lewinsky scandal? 
</P>
<P>
	``I did,'' Starr said Monday evening on the PBS program, ``The  
NewsHour With Jim Lehrer.'' ``I thought it was the right and 
sensible and certainly by far the most efficient way to go'' by 
accepting. 
</P>
<P>
	The result of Starr's repeated expansions is that controversies  
such as possible false statements about the White House travel 
office firings are lingering and must be dealt with by his 
successor, Robert Ray. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr acknowledged Monday in various television interviews that  
he had made mistakes -- all this from the man who became so 
controversial that his tenure was Exhibit A for members of Congress 
who refused earlier this year to renew the post-Watergate law that 
created Starr's office.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Profits Rise 30 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- First-quarter profits at Microsoft Corp. jumped  
30 percent, helped by continued strong demand for the company's 
Office 2000 and other business software. 
</P>
<P>
	The results easily beat Wall Street expectations, causing shares  
of the Redmond-based company to surge 5 percent in after-hours 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft reported net earnings of $2.19 billion or 40 cents a  
share for the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with profits of 
$1.68 billion or 31 cents a share a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding a gain of $156 million from the sale of the city  
entertainment guide portion of the MSN Sidewalk online guide, 
Microsoft earned 38 cents a share for the three months ended Sept. 
30. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had projected 
earnings of 34 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterly revenue rose 28 percent, from $4.19 billion to $5.38  
billion, the company said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft shares closed at $86.31 1/4, down $1.56 1/4, on the Nasdaq  
Stock Exchange. Many technology stocks fell after Dell Computer 
announced late Monday that a surge in the price of computer memory 
chips will likely hurt its third-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in after-hours trading on Instinet, shares of Microsoft  
were trading at $90.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Maffei, chief financial officer, said that despite worries  
that companies might be reluctant to buy software because of the 
possible problems resulting from the Year 2000 calendar change, 
there was healthy corporate demand for Office 2000, the latest 
version of the suite of business applications introduced in June. 
Sales of Windows NT Server and BackOffice software also did well. 
</P>
<P>
	Maffei told analysts in a conference call that he expects a  
strong second quarter fueled by brisk holiday sales, more demand 
for Office 2000 and even a little year-end spending by corporate 
computer managers who have gotten their Year 2000 plans squared 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, Maffei had cautioned that Microsoft sales could be  
dampened as companies devoted all their resources to stomping out 
any Y2K computer bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, ``We don't see a massive deterioration of business,''  
he said. ``We expect that Y2K is not going to be a major problem 
any more than it has been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of personal computers continued to grow, especially in  
Asia, and Microsoft expects that trend to continue in the December 
quarter, he said. Microsoft's Windows operating system is shipped 
on about 90 percent of all personal computers sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue from Asia climbed 82 percent to $593 million, because of  
the region's improved economy and the launch of localized versions 
of Office 2000, particularly in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very pleased with the results in Asia,'' said Carla  
Lewis, director of investor relations. ``That seems to be 
definitely coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for new PCs has stayed strong, even as competition and  
pricing pressures among computer makers has intensified, Lewis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from Microsoft's Windows products grew 17 percent to  
$2.25 billion in the quarter, thanks to strong increases in the 
number of programs shipped with new computers. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped offset less revenue from retail packaged versions of  
Windows 98, the operating system for home and small business 
computers. Retail demand for Windows 98 was especially strong last 
year, when the product was launched in June 1998. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Insurance Provided for Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Steve Haase sees his new company as the next  
Lloyd's of London, which got is start protecting businesses 
entering the new frontier of overseas trading. Haase's company 
wants to do the same for Internet's shipping lanes. 
</P>
<P>
	INSUREtrust.com is one of the first insurance firms to indemnify  
companies doing business on the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based firm provides liability coverage for all  
aspects of computer operations -- whether they come as a ``crash'' 
caused by a software/hardware breakdown, or a hack from an outside 
source. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been three major movements within business --  
waterborne trade, the Industrial Revolution and the Information 
Age,'' said Haase, chief executive officer for the year-old company 
considered the first to cater entirely to computer risk-management. 
``It really looks like we're doing something that's really cutting 
edge, but we're really applying old concepts to a new medium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	INSUREtrust.com protects companies against anything from  
computer crashes or malfunctions to ``hacks'' into networks from 
outside invaders and the loss of data or money due to any of the 
above. 
</P>
<P>
	Policies can also protect against potential copyright  
infringements on Web sites and lawsuits from customers whose 
shipments were lost or whose privacy was violated, or against 
losses incurred if a disgruntled employee shuts down the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Joanne Orfanos of the National Association of Independent  
Insurers said several companies have begun offering piecemeal 
Internet protection policies, but INSUREtrust.com is the first 
company to specifically cater to e-businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they've done is taken a step toward legitimizing the  
Internet and making it safer,'' said Blaine Burnham, a former 
National Security Administration computer security specialist who 
now heads Georgia Tech's Information Security Center. 
</P>
<P>
	But there remains a degree of perhaps healthy insecurity. While  
INSUREtrust.com has signed up with at least a dozen companies, 
several declined interview requests, fearing the publicity of being 
``insured'' would make them likely targets for hacker attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of big name companies out there -- household  
names, mind you -- who don't want the publicity of a hack,'' said 
Spence Hoole, an executive with Aon Risk Management, which has 
bought INSUREtrust.com policies for clients. ``That's why 
INSUREtrust.com, or at least a form of it, will be around for a 
while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For an annual premium of between $5,000 to $250,000, companies  
can buy coverage of up to $25 million a year. But INSUREtrust.com 
goes further than financial protection. 
</P>
<P>
	A company's computer network security system must pass muster  
before INSUREtrust.com will take it on. A former Pentagon computer 
expert helps conduct the inspections, and Haase said they have 
turned down potential customers. 
</P>
<P>
	For those that do pass, the company offers consulting on how to  
improve network security, and those that take the advice can lower 
their premiums. A lot of companies need a lot of work, said Rick 
Davis, who co-founded INSUREtrust.com with Haase. 
</P>
<P>
	``We used to be surprised by the levels of insecurity and  
noncontrol when it came to networks at the corporate level,'' said 
Davis, a former insurance agent who is now the company's 
information and development officer. ``It was quickly obvious to us 
and is now becoming obvious to anyone in the industry that risk 
management is sorely lacking in e-business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haase said the privately held company is at about the break-even  
point, and expanding rapidly, hiring 13 new employees since August. 
He said the company continues to target emerging technology firms -- 
``so we can be involved in the full life cycle of an e-business,'' 
Haase said, adding other potential customers include hospitals, 
Internet service providers, data entry and storage firms as well as 
anyone selling anything over the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see a movement toward offering warranties that certain  
security measures work, or a transaction is completely safe, or 
whatever,'' Haase said. ``What we can do is validate those 
warranties. And that will take e-business one step closer to the 
legitimacy it really needs right now.''

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Military To Unveil Govt. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan's military regime rejected  
international criticism Tuesday and promised to unveil its new 
government within a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Army spokesman Brig. Rashid Quereshi also said deposed prime  
minister Nawaz Sharif is in good health, but will remain in 
``protective custody'' until a corruption investigation is 
conducted. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one has been ill-treated at all,'' he told reporters,  
declining to say where Sharif is being held. 
</P>
<P>
	Quereshi said that it would likely be another week before Army  
Chief Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf announces the six-member National 
Security Council of army officers and civilians who will form a new 
government. Few people in Pakistan are in a hurry for elections, 
and Quereshi said there is a lot of work ahead for the council 
before voting can be held. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to speculate on a time frame, saying the army ``does  
not want democracy in name only but in substance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Each decision that is taken is going to be well deliberated,  
well-studied because if that amount of effort doesn't go into the 
initial stages it is likely to go wrong,'' Quereshi said. 
</P>
<P>
	He dismissed those who have been critical of the new military  
regime, saying ``grave areas of concern need to be put right ... a 
lot outside this country do not understand the ground realities in 
Pakistan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Commonwealth foreign ministers suspended Pakistan  
from the organization's councils and said it would send a mission 
to Islamabad to press the new military regime to restore democracy. 
The action could lead to Pakistan's suspension from the 
organization of Britain and its former colonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan's foreign secretary, Shamshed Ahmed, asked the  
Commonwealth to send a ``fact-finding'' mission to Pakistan to 
gauge the public support for the army before making a final 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Quereshi said an investigation has begun into what happened at  
Karachi Airport on Oct. 12, when the aircraft returning Musharraf 
and 200 other people to Pakistan from Sri Lanka was not allowed to 
land. 
</P>
<P>
	The army takeover had already begun when the aircraft carrying  
the army chief was denied landing rights, apparently on Sharif's 
orders. The pilot was reportedly told he had to fly to another 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	It was kept in the air until the army gained control of the  
airport and allowed the plane to land with barely 10 minutes of 
fuel remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Quereshi said no decision has been made about whether Sharif  
will be tried in military or civilian courts.

<HEADLINE> Girls, Suspects Ordered Separated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Four teen-age girls being held as material  
witnesses in the same juvenile lockup as some of those accused of 
abducting and raping them will be moved, a judge ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge granted all four girls $50,000 personal recognizance  
bonds and ordered new placements for them. 
</P>
<P>
	M. Jon Posner, the lawyer a 17-year-old girl, said his client  
would be released from the Wayne County Juvenile Detention Facility 
as early as Tuesday night, and placed in a shelter where she could 
receive counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	The other three girls, ages 14, 15 and 16, will be moved within  
the county youth home system, prosecutor Doug Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls had been kept in Detroit as material witnesses after  
police arrested five suspects charged with multiple counts of rape. 
The victims and suspects are Laotian-Americans and members of the 
Hmong ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
	Four teen-age boys and a 20-year-old man are charged as adults  
and are being held on $1 million bonds. A preliminary hearing for 
the suspects is set for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Posner said that while his client was being held she had to wear  
a uniform and no counseling was provided. ``Not only was she there 
with her assailants, she was being treated as a detainee,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker said he was aware there was a perception the girls were  
being held in an unpleasant situation, but that there was little 
choice to ensure the girls showed up to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	``One has to keep in mind that in order to hold accountable  
those who did these horrible crimes, this was the only way to do 
it,'' Baker said.

<HEADLINE> Two New Stocks Welcomed Warmly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wall Street made room today for the genteel  
world of Martha Stewart and the crude showmanship of the World 
Wrestling Federation, embracing both ventures as they sold stock to 
the public for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc., which  
specializes in how-to information for consumers, nearly tripled at 
the outset on the New York Stock Exchange, before giving up a 
little of its gains. Also making a strong debut was World Wrestling 
Federation Entertainment Inc., known for its outrageous ring 
theatrics, which more than doubled on the Nasdaq Stock Market 
before slipping back a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	Both initial public offerings of stock, or IPOs, were eagerly  
awaited because both companies have heavy media involvement and 
have been making inroads in online marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Martha Stewart Living shares were priced late Monday at $18, at  
the top of the revised $16-to-$18 range announced earlier in the 
day. The shares initially had been expected to sell in a range of 
$13 to $15. 
</P>
<P>
	The offering price is the price at which the stock is made  
available to preferred customers, most of them institutions, such 
as pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
	It opened at $37.25 a share, soared to $52 and was trading at  
$37.81 1/4 Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Martha IPO involved 7.2 million shares of common stock,  
which are trading under the symbol MSO. Martha Stewart Living 
granted its underwriters options to buy 1.1 million additional 
shares to cover over-allotments. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the initial public offering of 10 million common  
shares of World Wrestling common stock was priced at $17 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	World Wrestling shares, using the code WWFE, opened at $30.50 on  
the Nasdaq Stock Market and quickly rose to $35 before dropping 
back to $26.62 1/2 in afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwriters for the Stamford, Conn.-based company were led by  
Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	WWF, which has wildly popular weekly cable shows and monthly  
pay-per-view matches, has said it plans to use proceeds from the 
offering for working capital and other business purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview broadcast on CNBC, Martha Stewart said she  
expected shareholders to be ``nicely rewarded'' if they purchase 
stock in her company. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the company has pioneered a new media category she  
called ``lifestyle'' and added: ``We intend to dominate this 
category for a long time to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart also said there were no plans to spin off Internet  
operations as a separate company. ``We really feel that we are an 
integrated media company with a very, very excellent prospect for 
intense growth on the Internet,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Martha Stewart Living offering is being managed by Morgan  
Stanley Dean Witter, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Bear Stearns, Donaldson, 
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette and Banc of America Securities LLC. 
</P>
<P>
	In its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in  
July, Martha Stewart Living said it planned to use proceeds from 
the offering to repurchase shares held by Time Publishing Ventures 
Inc. and for business development.

<HEADLINE> TV Stations Discuss Columbine H.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- When the three executives responsible for  
what most Americans saw on TV in the horrifying hours after the 
Columbine High School massacre share their stories, what's most 
striking is what they leave out. 
</P>
<P>
	There's little boasting, no talk about who had the best camera  
angles, whose news helicopter was first on the scene or who was 
quickest to divulge the names of the two boys who killed 13 people 
and themselves this spring in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they're more apt to talk about what didn't make the  
air. Or why a psychologist was secretly sent to speak to reporters. 
Or why three people who live to beat each other on stories actually 
met to plan coverage together when Columbine reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	The lessons that news directors of KCNC-TV, KMGH-TV and KUSA-TV  
in Denver offer today have more to do with sensitivity than speed 
in telling the story. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the most part, we sort of put the competitive situation  
behind because we all wanted to see this come out the right way,'' 
said Angie Kucharski of KCNC at a recent panel run by the Radio and 
Television News Directors Association in Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the stations covered the developing story live on April  
20, and their reports were fed to the world via cable news stations 
and broadcast networks. 
</P>
<P>
	By no means was the coverage perfect. KUSA goofed by putting on  
the air in a live feed a young man who said he was a student 
calling on a cell phone from within Columbine. He turned out to be 
an impostor, but if it had been real, it was a situation that could 
have put him or others in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	Stations aired helicopter footage of SWAT teams moving in and  
students fleeing in panic -- risky pictures if the gunmen were still 
alive and had access to television. 
</P>
<P>
	But two experts who went back and reviewed the coverage praised  
how the local stations handled it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they did a remarkably good job, considering the  
situation, considering the stress and the kind of pressure they 
were under with live television,'' said Alicia Shepard of American 
Journalism Review, who is devoting a chapter to Columbine in a 
journalism textbook she is writing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were tremendously sensitive to the culture and the  
audience,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Steele, an ethics group leader at the Poynter Institute in  
Florida, said that despite some mistakes, the coverage held up well 
compared to similar major breaking stories. The local journalists 
were appropriately aggressive and thorough, yet were respectful to 
people caught up in the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the stations held back reporting the names of victims  
and assailants, in some cases for hours, until they were confirmed 
by authorities. Some reporters who interviewed students urged them 
not to identify who they saw in school. Cameras were often left 
behind when students were approached for interviews, or they 
weren't approached at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The news directors said it was important not to fill air time  
with speculation for fear of terrifying parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The magnitude of the story forces you to take that step back  
and say, `We don't need to be wrong on this,''' Kucharski said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the first day, the news directors -- aware of community  
resentment against national reporters -- met to plan coverage for 
when Columbine students returned. The news executives also watched 
the emotional health of their employees; Diane Mulligan of KMGH-TV 
brought cookies and coffee to the scene and arranged for 
post-trauma counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question I have is what would have happened in Los Angeles  
or New York City?'' Shepard said. ``Would the same thing have 
happened or would the competitiveness have gotten in the way of 
sensitivity?'' 
</P>
<P>
	What's also striking when watching the three news directors  
discuss their coverage is that each of them -- Kucharski, Mulligan 
and Patti Ann Dennis -- is a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussing whether that has anything to do with their story  
coverage is, in itself, a sensitive issue. Kucharski's back seemed 
to stiffen when she was asked about it, as if guarding against an 
oncoming professional slight. Her decisions were in the service of 
journalism, not gender, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	To Shepard, the question is not out of line.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think that they were very solid journalistically and the  
fact that they were women may have enhanced their sensitivity,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele noted that there has been some academic research into the  
question of a masculine and feminine approach to decision-making 
and moral reasoning. Neither approach is always connected to 
gender, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that these were three women news directors may have  
had something to do with the quality of the coverage and the 
sensitivity that the stations brought to it,'' he said. ``They were 
good leaders and decision-makers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, how a television station performs when tested by a  
breaking story of this magnitude has much to do with the staff's 
experiences and grounding as journalists, and the direction set 
from the top. There's only so much that can be done in advance, 
Kucharski said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the scanner goes off,'' she said, ``I have yet to see a  
newsroom where they open up their drawers and get their binders out 
to look at a plan.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jacksonville Jaguars Acquire Upshaw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The Jacksonville Jaguars traded an  
undisclosed draft pick to Tampa Bay for defensive end Regan Upshaw 
on Tuesday, the NFL trading deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	A first-round choice by the Bucs in 1996, Upshaw started 47  
games in his first three seasons, making 18 1/2 sacks and 104 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	But he never quite lived up to expectations, and with the  
Buccaneers deep on the defensive line, they demoted him to backup 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Upshaw was the subject of trade talks with the San Francisco  
49ers, but the Bucs apparently were asking too much. The Jaguars 
are expected to give up a low pick, probably a sixth-round choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We keep ourselves in a position cap-wise so that when we find  
a player of his ability at a good value, we can make a move,'' 
Jaguars senior vice president Michael Huyghue said. ``We've had 
plenty of injuries at that position. History tells us you can never 
have enough players there who can get up the field the way he 
can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drafted 12th after leaving Cal following his junior year, Upshaw  
has been active for only one of Tampa Bay's five games this year. 
He becomes a free agent after this season. His 1999 base salary is 
$600,000. He will count about $375,000 against the Jaguars salary 
cap this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is an effort to improve depth on Jacksonville's  
defensive line, which lost reserve end Eric Curry to a knee injury 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that loss, the line has thrived with the additions of  
Gary Walker and Larry Smith and the return to health of Tony 
Brackens, Seth Payne and Renaldo Wynn. 
</P>
<P>
	Under new defensive coordinator Dom Capers, Jacksonville leads  
the league in sacks with 22 and is first in yardage allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Upshaw had seven sacks last season and is the 10th-ranked sacker  
in Bucs history. 
</P>
<P>
	Huyghue said the team doesn't view him as a reclamation project.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's only 24 and he has been productive,'' he said. ``He's  
certainly not in the twilight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for him on the roster, the Jaguars waived  
linebacker Chester Burnett.

<HEADLINE> Crews Hope To Haul Off Shipwreck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- Salvage crews dug into their bag of tricks  
today to try to haul the stubborn stern of the New Carissa off the 
beach where it has been mired for eight months. 
</P>
<P>
	After grudgingly being turned to sea and dragged from the hole  
it had dug for itself in the sand, the 120-foot stern section has 
defied efforts to refloat it and tow it to the deep ocean for 
burial. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews decided today to have a second tug, the Atlantic Salvor,  
join the Salvage Chief to pull the wreck free but it will be a few 
days before crews can hook up the other tug. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be tweaking and dredging and trying this and trying  
that,'' said Bill Milwee, a representative of the ship's Japanese 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always optimistic,'' he said. ``You've got to be.''  
</P>
<P>
	Tides are gradually swelling this week to bring deeper water to  
the shore, increasing chances the New Carissa will finally float 
just enough to drag her across the sand. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasts are for good weather through the weekend, easing  
worries that winter storms could arrive and shut down the salvage 
effort until spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwee said the propeller of the broken ship may be digging into  
the sand like an anchor. Crews plan to flood part of the forward 
section of the stern in an effort to lift the prop partly out of 
the sand. 
</P>
<P>
	The 640-foot freighter ran aground Feb. 4 while it was standing  
off Coos Bay in a winter storm waiting to pick up a load of wood 
chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, it has been one problem after another.  
</P>
<P>
	A harbor pilot tried to pull the ship off the beach with its own  
engines, but failed. While waiting for a break in rough weather for 
a salvage tug to make its way down the coast, the ship bounced and 
twisted in the surf, cracking the hull and releasing thousands of 
gallons of fuel oil that fouled beaches and shorebirds. 
</P>
<P>
	Under pressure to prevent further oil leakage, a joint command  
made up of Milwee, the Coast Guard and the state decided to take a 
desperate step and burn the wreck to get rid of as much oil as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire set by a Navy demolition team did not consume all the  
oil, and more was released as the ship, weakened by the constant 
pounding in the surf, broke in two. 
</P>
<P>
	After 20 more days, the joint command lit victory cigars and  
gave each other high-fives as an ocean-going tug pulled the bow 
section off the beach, but the celebration was short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
	In a severe storm, the cable parted, and the bow soon was back  
on the beach, this time 80 miles north in Waldport. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Senate Sets Vote on Campaign Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Campaign finance legislation is tottering  
toward a pair of Senate test votes after a symbolic show of 
opposition to unlimited soft-money contributions to political 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a defining vote,'' Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said  
shortly before the Senate went on record 92-1 Monday for a 
soft-money ban that is at the heart of his legislation to curtail 
the role of big money in campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the principal Senate foe of the  
legislation, said the vote was nothing of the sort. In advance, he 
pronounced the roll call meaningless and successfully urged 
opponents of the campaign finance bill to join with supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., dissented.  
</P>
<P>
	That set the stage for today's two scheduled votes, in which  
supporters will need a majority of 60 to advance beyond a 
filibuster led by McConnell and other Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would ban soft money and allow nonunion members  
to restrict the ability of unions to spend mandatory dues on 
political activities. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain and Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., stripped the measure  
of other restrictions on campaign money in an attempt to avoid the 
fate of earlier measures, all of which have died at the hands of 
filibusters. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle also decided to seek a vote  
on the broader bill that McCain and Feingold have supported in past 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Soft money is distinct from so-called hard money, in which the  
size of a donor's contribution is limited. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's vote capped a day of often lively debate in which  
opponents of the legislation renewed their attack on McCain's 
assertion that large soft-money donations are corrupting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who are corrupt will be corrupt regardless of the  
system. And those who are not corrupt will not be corrupt 
regardless of the system,'' said Sen. Robert F. Bennett, R-Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett spiced his argument with an incident from the career of  
his father, who served as a GOP senator for 24 years. Bennett 
recalled sitting in his father's office when a Democratic senator 
handed over an envelope filled with $5,000 in cash as a campaign 
donation. 
</P>
<P>
	Cash contributions were legal then, and Bennett said  
emphatically his father, the late Wallace Bennett, was not corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett also said that as a senator, former President Harry  
Truman placed his wife on the payroll, even though she did no work. 
That was a common practice at the time, he said, as senators 
struggled to make ends meet. But Truman, too, was not corrupt, 
Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Bennett said that by the logic of McCain's argument,  
organized labor should give campaign money to Republicans, the 
better to ``turn them into rabid supporters of the AFL-CIO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organized labor reliably supports Democrats.

<HEADLINE> NBC Has Good Week / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Television viewers clearly enjoy seeing Alan  
Alda back beside an operating table: his appearance on ``ER'' 
boosted the medical drama's ratings and led NBC to its best week 
since Michael Jordan's final jumpshot. 
</P>
<P>
	Alda, the former M A S H surgeon, began a brief stint working in  
the emergency room of Chicago's mythical Cook County General 
Hospital on Thursday. The well-publicized appearance increased the 
``ER'' audience by 2 million people over the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	``ER'' was easily last week's most-watched show, with nearly 9  
million more viewers than its closest competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's 11.0 rating and 18 share won Nielsen Media Research's  
weekly ratings race. It was the network's biggest weekly audience 
since June 1998, when NBC covered Jordan's last games in the NBA 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Another sport -- baseball -- helped NBC last week. The New York  
Mets' 15-inning victory over the Atlanta Braves Sunday in the 
National League Championship Series was the highest-rated league 
championship game with an afternoon start since 1987, perhaps 
because it stretched to nearly 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	It enabled NBC to do well on a night that CBS normally wins, and  
postpone a TV movie on disc jockey Alan Freed that had received 
poor reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS finished second for the week with a 9.2 rating and 15 share.  
Fox, also buoyed by baseball coverage, finished third with a 7.6 
rating and 13 share and ABC had a 7.2 rating and 12 share. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB had a 3.1 rating and 5 share, improving UPN had a 2.8  
rating and 5 share and Pax TV had a 0.8 rating and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won the evening news ratings race  
with a 7.5 rating and 16 share. The ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 7.4 
rating and 16 share, while the ``CBS Evening News'' had a 6.4 
rating and 14 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Oct. 11-17, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: 
</P>
<P>
	``ER,'' NBC, 20.4; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 13.8; ``Friends,'' NBC,  
13.8; ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 12.3; ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' CBS, 12.2; ``National League Championship Series: Atlanta 
vs. N.Y. Mets,'' NBC, 12.0; ``Law and Order,'' NBC, 11.7; ``Judging 
Amy,'' CBS, 11.7; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 11.7; ``CBS Sunday Movie: 
Silk Hope,'' CBS, 11.4.

<HEADLINE> Gore Press Secretary Stays in D.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore's move to Nashville has cost him  
another senior campaign worker. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiki Moore, press secretary for Gore's presidential campaign,  
said Tuesday she has decided for personal reasons not to move to 
Nashville, Tenn., with the campaign. Moore, who had been asked to 
remain aboard, said she plans to help the vice president from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	No replacement has been named. The press secretary in Gore's  
vice presidential office, Chris Lehane, will continue to serve as 
Gore's chief spokesman on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said she expects to be a regular Gore advocate on  
television. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will win the volunteer of the year award because I'm not  
going to leave the team, I'm just changing positions,'' she said. 
``I'm going to go into my volunteer mode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least six senior Gore aides will not be making the move. In  
addition, Gore still has no communications director. Former White 
House aide Mark Fabiani recently turned down the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's top aide, Tony Coelho, and top strategist, Carter Eskew,  
have moved to Nashville. Former political director Donna Brazile 
was promoted to campaign manager and also moved to Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the benefits of Gore's move is a leaner campaign,  
according to aides. But they also acknowledge that the changes may 
be disruptive as the vice president prepares for a series of 
debates with rival Bill Bradley, a former New Jersey senator.

<HEADLINE> Vikes Troubled Despite Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Randall Cunningham is a backup again,  
and the Minnesota Vikings are holding out hope that the switch to 
Jeff George will turn their season around. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the end of the road, there's 10 games left and the  
way the division and the league's going right now, everybody's 
getting beat,'' George said. ``All it takes is one win to get this 
thing turned around and get the confidence back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota (2-4) was once a team with Super Bowl ambitions. Now,  
a fourth loss in five weeks has Randy Moss wondering whether the 
Vikings can even reach the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never really been in this situation in my whole life,  
playing basketball, football, baseball, anything,'' Moss said. ``So 
I can't really tell you if we're going to make the playoffs or not. 
Hopefully we can, but if not, bite your tongue and look for next 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings are reeling as they head into a difficult stretch  
against San Francisco, Denver and Dallas without running back 
Robert Smith, a 1,000-yard rusher who flew to Tampa on Monday for a 
hernia operation that will sideline him up to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	His backup, Leroy Hoard, has a mouthful of stitches after biting  
through his bottom lip Sunday. He'll need plastic surgery and might 
not be able to practice much this week. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike so many of their fans, the Vikings aren't ready to  
give up on their season, not with the NFC Central so unsettled and 
not with a quarterback change providing optimism for a turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	George replaced Cunningham with Detroit ahead 19-0 at halftime  
Sunday and led a comeback that was rendered futile when Jason 
Hanson's last-second field goal lifted the Lions to a 25-23 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	George, a 10-year veteran who signed a one-year, $400,000  
contract, produced more points in one half than the Vikings managed 
in any full game this season under Cunningham, whose five-year, $28 
million deal he signed last December spurred the now regrettable 
trading of Brad Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	George was 10-of-12 for 214 yards and two touchdowns, providing  
the spark that was missing all season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talk about the fire in the Vikings' eyes, and that second  
half we had that fire, we came back,'' Moss said. ``That field goal 
... it was like they put it out with a fire extinguisher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that led to some fuming in the Vikings locker room, where  
Moss criticized the coaches' decision to play the percentages and 
settle for a field goal that put them ahead 23-22 with 1:40 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss wanted George to throw into the end zone on third-and-7  
from the Lions 12 with 1:51 remaining, but coach Dennis Green and 
offensive coordinator Ray Sherman called for another run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year's team went for everything,'' Moss said.  
</P>
<P>
	Soothing many of Moss' concerns, however, was the promotion of  
George, who will start against San Francisco on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	George has worn out his welcome everywhere he's played, but his  
reputation as a talented troublemaker more concerned about himself 
than his team hasn't followed him to Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said the same thing about Randall Cunningham,'' Green  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Cunningham said he's George's biggest fan now.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pulling for him to do well, not only for us as a team but  
also I know what he's been through. I'd love to see him have a lot 
of joy in his life,'' Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Cunningham was the backup who stepped in when Johnson  
got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could really happen like it did last year. The amazing  
thing is it seems like that's the trend with this team,'' 
Cunningham said. ``One year Brad steps in and does a great job and 
gets a new contract. The next year, Randall steps in and gets a new 
contract. It's Jeff's turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But will a new contract follow if George rebuilds his reputation  
by delivering the Vikings from the edge of one of the most colossal 
failures in NFL history? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry about that,'' George said. ``I worry about the  
San Francisco 49ers. I've been around too long to worry about 
what's going to happen in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here hopefully to get to the Super Bowl, whether I was  
playing or not.''

<HEADLINE> N.C. Suffers Through 3rd Hurricane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Eastern North Carolina residents are  
struggling to raise their spirits after suffering through three 
straight hurricanes that have deluged the state with 4 feet of 
rain, damaged thousands of homes and turned lives upside down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope that it gets better soon,'' said Casheila Draughn,  
43. 
</P>
<P>
	She spoke Monday from a Red Cross center, a day after Hurricane  
Irene dropped up to 11 inches of rain onto the region. The storm 
veered out into the Atlantic late Sunday without making landfall in 
North Carolina, but it still brought heavy rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it can't be as bad as it was the last time, but I'm  
just hoping for life to get close to normal,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Normal may still be months away: Hundreds of people already live  
in camping trailers because their homes were damaged in floodwaters 
from Hurricane Floyd in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rains overwhelmed rivers and promised to produce more  
serious flooding later this week as runoff drains into the Tar, 
Neuse and Cape Fear rivers -- the last with crests 8 feet above 
flood stage expected. 
</P>
<P>
	To make matters worse, Tropical Storm Jose was swirling in the  
Caribbean and could reach hurricane strength later today. By this 
morning, its maximum sustained winds had increased to near 65 mph. 
Forecasters were uncertain of its track but said it could threaten 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	State transportation officials said Irene was responsible for  
156 road closings as of late Monday. That was on top of 75 roads 
that still remain closed in the aftermath of Floyd. Still, inland 
rainfall amounts in most areas were below more grave predictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were fortunate,'' Gov. Jim Hunt said Monday. ``It didn't  
turn out to be a great big thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people living in a government camper trailer park in  
Rocky Mount returned to their trailers Monday after spending Sunday 
night in a shelter. Schools in the area returned to a normal 
schedule today. 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Farrar, a Red Cross mental health counselor in Tarboro,  
said many people have become ``hypervigilant'' -- nervously mindful 
of every change of weather, every rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just demoralized,'' she said. ``They just want no more  
of this. The last one was more than they could handle, and now 
people are saying, `No way, Jose.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Irene was blamed for one death in North Carolina, a motorist  
whose vehicle hydroplaned into a tree Sunday in Granville County. 
Eight other people died as a result of the storm elsewhere, 
including five in Florida. A pair of Irene-spawned tornadoes were 
blamed for two injuries in North Carolina on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Cross has dispatched 244 mental health workers to  
eastern North Carolina to help flood victims cope. That is more 
than for any other disaster except the Oklahoma City bombing, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are overwhelmed right now by the fact that they have to  
clean up after the storms and be a mom and a dad and an employee,'' 
said Red Cross spokeswoman Gina Giarronardo. 
</P>
<P>
	First North Carolinians suffered through Hurricane Dennis, which  
battered the coast for a week and dumped up to 8 inches of rain. 
Two weeks later, Floyd poured 20 inches of rain, causing record 
flooding and 49 deaths. An additional 8 inches fell less than two 
weeks after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Irene arrived.  
</P>
<P>
	``You get lifted up and the next thing you know, something else  
happens,'' said Karen Mabry, who was flooded by Floyd and then 
watched Irene's floodwaters creep into Tarboro, 65 miles east of 
Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	The story was the same along South Carolina's coast.  
</P>
<P>
	A day after Irene swelled the Waccamaw River to almost 9 feet  
Monday -- or nearly 2 feet above flood stage -- Mary Roberts returned 
to her riverside home to find 8 inches of water sloshing in her 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lived here 42 years, and I've never had water in my  
house,'' said Roberts, who has no insurance. ``It's been 
heartbreaking. My floor just bulged up. My ceiling's cracked. My 
furniture's molded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Savannah Bluff, islands of craggy sand mounds protruded from  
bluish-black waters coursing across the road. Cars splashed 
single-file through the murky streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had carpet everywhere. It's in the Dumpster,'' said Dorothy  
Paul, pointing to a wobbly metal block in the sea of floating 
debris. She and her husband had planned to start repairs on their 
home this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think we'll wait till next week,'' said Paul, who is  
retired. ``Until those floors dry, we don't know what's going to 
happen. No one can predict this kind of weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pauls built in Savannah Bluff five years ago. Despite the  
flooding, they have no plans to leave the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you tell me where it's more likely there will be no  
earthquakes, no tornadoes, no hurricanes, no flooding -- you tell me 
where, and I'll move,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Dell Issues Earnings Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp. said a  
higher-than-expected surge in the price of computer memory chips 
will likely hurt its third-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement late Monday sent Dell shares tumbling 8 percent  
this morning on the Nasdaq Stock Market, dropping 3 9/16 to 37 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	An earthquake in Taiwan last month disrupted production at  
factories that produce between 12 percent and 15 percent of the 
world's random access memory, or RAM, chips. 
</P>
<P>
	RAM is important to a computer because it stores information  
that a processor might need at another point, allowing a user and 
the computer to more rapidly switch back and forth between tasks 
for everything from screensavers to spreadsheets to games. 
</P>
<P>
	During its fall analyst meeting held Oct. 7, Dell said the  
``supply situation'' of memory chips was progressing well. Since 
then, however, Dell said prices had increased more sharply than 
expected, to as much as 25 percent higher than the previous price. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are managing the memory situation carefully and are working  
to offset the cost increases with efficiencies in other parts of 
our business,'' Thomas J. Meredith, Dell's chief financial officer, 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had projected  
Dell to earn 20 cents a share in the third quarter. Dell will 
report its results Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Meredith said the company considers the effects of the  
memory-cost issue to be a short-term matter and should not affect 
the longer-term outlook for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	In its second-quarter earnings report, Dell, the largest seller  
of computers directly to customers, earned $507 million, or 19 
cents per share. The results beat expectations by 2 cents a share.

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Up Sibling Adoption Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation approved by the House Monday would  
make foreign children ages 16 and 17 eligible for adoption if they 
are adopted together with their siblings. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, passed 404-0, amends current immigration law that  
allows U.S. citizens to bring an adopted child into the country 
only if that child is age 15 or younger. The Senate has yet to take 
it up. 
</P>
<P>
	The purpose of the bill, introduced by Rep. Steve Horn,  
R-Calif., is to help those Americans wishing to adopt the older 
sibling of a child they are adopting in order to keep the family 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	Adoption of older children is fairly rare. Of 11,316 immigrant  
orphans adopted in fiscal 1996, only 351 were age 10 or older. 
</P>
<P>
	----

<HEADLINE> Vitamin E May Lower Cancer Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A diet rich in vitamin E foods such as nuts  
and whole grains can lower the risk of lung cancer among smokers by 
about 20 percent, a new study says. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study of more than 29,000 male smokers in Finland,  
researchers found that those who had high blood levels of 
alpha-tocopherol, the main form of vitamin E, reduced their 
incidence of lung cancer by 19 percent to 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The benefits were most dramatic, the study found, among men  
under age 60 and among light smokers who had been using cigarettes 
for less than 40 years. The reduction in lung cancer risk in these 
groups was from 40 percent to 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the encouraging finding, said Dr. Demetrius Albanes  
of the National Cancer Institute, the most beneficial health action 
smokers can take is still the same: Stop smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to emphasize that not only for lung cancer, but for  
oral cancer, pancreas cancer, kidney cancer and a bunch of other 
cancers, stopping smoking is crucial,'' said Albanes, the senior 
author of the study being published Wednesday in the Journal of the 
National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, which lasted for almost eight years, researchers  
took periodic blood samples to measure the levels of 
alpha-tocopherol, the most active form of vitamin E in humans. The 
levels of alpha-tocopherol were then linked to health outcomes 
among the men in the study. There were 1,144 cases of lung cancer 
diagnosed in the group during the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The lung cancer rate reduced among men with the highest levels  
of alpha-tocopherol, said Albanes, and the cancer protection was 
most pronounced among men with the shortest history of smoking who 
also had high vitamin E levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the new study involved only smokers and lung cancer,  
earlier studies have shown that healthy levels of vitamin E give 
some protection against heart disease, stroke and some other types 
of cancer, such as prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Albanes said the proven benefits came only from a balanced diet  
that included food rich in vitamin E, he said. The researchers drew 
no conclusions about the effect of vitamin pills taken by some of 
the men in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	In effect, he said the proven benefits of vitamin E come from  
eating the right foods, not from popping vitamin pills. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need more studies to compare supplements with natural diet  
sources of vitamin E,'' he said, noting that there are still 
uncertainties about the comparative value of vitamin pills vs. 
nutrients absorbed naturally from foods. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, some studies have shown that beta carotene, an  
antioxidant found in foods such as carrots, can help prevent some 
forms of cancer. Yet, when beta carotene pills were given to the 
group of Finnish smokers, the rate of lung cancer actually 
increased by 16 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Albanes said that vitamin E-rich foods include soybean oil and  
other seed oils; nuts, particularly almonds, filberts, hazelnuts 
and walnuts, sunflower seeds and whole grains, including wheat 
germ.

<HEADLINE> Celtics' Forston May Miss 3 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Boston Celtics forward Danny Fortson has  
a stress fracture in his right foot and will miss 8-12 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics announced Fortson's injury in Charlotte during the  
first half of their exhibition against the Hornets on Tuesday 
night. The team said Fortson, hobbling on crutches before the game, 
would return to Boston on Wednesday for further tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortson, a third-year pro, was acquired in an offseason trade  
with Denver that sent former first-round draft choice Ron Mercer 
from Boston to the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7, 260-pound Fortson started Boston's exhibition  
opener last Wednesday and had eight points and 11 rebounds. He came 
off the bench two nights later against Atlanta, getting a game-high 
12 rebounds in 20 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Profits Rise 30 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Continued strong demand for Microsoft Corp.'s  
Office 2000 and other business software helped the company to a 30 
percent increase in profits for the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft reported net earnings of $2.19 billion or 40 cents a  
share for the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with profits of 
$1.68 billion or 31 cents a share a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 28 percent, from $4.19 billion to $5.38 billion,  
the company said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarter's results include a gain of $156 million from the  
sale of the city entertainment guide portion of the MSN Sidewalk 
online guide, while last year's results include a gain of $160 
million from the sale of the Softimage subsidiary. Excluding those 
sales, per-share earnings grew from 28 cents to 38 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	The results well outpaced the consensus estimate of 34 cents a  
share by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Maffei, chief financial officer, said that despite worries  
that companies might be reluctant to buy software because of the 
Year 2000 calendar change, there was healthy corporate demand for 
Office 2000, the latest version of the suite of business 
applications introduced in June, and sales of Windows NT Server and 
BackOffice software. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does not appear that Y2K had a significant impact on  
results,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of personal computers continued to grow, especially in  
Asia, and Microsoft expects that trend to continue in the December 
quarter, he said. Microsoft's Windows operating system is shipped 
on about 90 percent of all personal computers sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's stock closed at $86.31 1/4, down $1.56 1/4 a share on the  
Nasdaq Stock Exchange. Many technology stocks fell after Dell 
Computer announced late Monday that a surge in the price of 
computer memory chips will likely hurt its third-quarter earnings.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Italy Dominate America's Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- U.S. teams and Italy's Prada  
dominated the opening races of the America's Cup challenger series 
today despite Japanese protests. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese team Nippon successfully sought a penalty against  
the New York Yacht Club's Young America after the boats scraped 
together before the start of their morning contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have a nice little shark bite just above the  
waterline,'' Young America afterguard Jim Brady said after 
admitting his team was in the wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The yacht's logo is a marauding shark. The Americans went on to  
win the race. 
</P>
<P>
	In the afternoon matchup, Nippon again protested, this time  
against San Francisco's AmericaOne, which snapped a steering chain 
during an aggressive duel for start positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Nippon objected to AmericaOne being granted a 45-minute delay  
for repairs and a restart to the race without penalty. Chief umpire 
Brian Willis said later the move was unusual but legal, and Nippon 
withdrew the protest. 
</P>
<P>
	In light winds that slowed racing to a crawl in the morning  
session, AmericaOne and Prada, considered among the favorites for 
the Louis Vuitton Cup, each trounced their respective opponents, 
winning by more than 14 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Wind picked up for the afternoon races, and the big-spending  
syndicates were again the strongest competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second day of the competition to decide who will take on  
New Zealand for yachting's most prized trophy in February 2000, 
Auckland had a perfect sunny spring day. 
</P>
<P>
	In the morning races, the Spanish challenge defeated Le Defi  
Francais by 55 seconds; AmericaOne defeated the Swiss Fast 2000 by 
14 minutes, 1 second; Abracadabra 2000 defeated America's Cup 
veteran Dennis Conner's Stars and Stripes by 3 minutes, 50 seconds; 
Prada defeated Young Australia by 14 minutes 43 seconds; and Young 
America defeated Nippon by 1 minute, 32 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the afternoon, Abracadabra defeated Young Australia by 1  
minute, 54 seconds; Young America defeated Fast2000 by 4 minutes, 
15 seconds; AmericaOne defeated Nippon by 2 minutes, 26 seconds; 
Prada defeated Stars and Stripes by 5 minutes, 4 seconds; and 
America True defeated Le Defi Francais by 54 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Young America, AmericaOne and Prada each have had four wins in  
four starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Young Australia lodged a protest against Prada, but withdrew it  
later, saying they misread the rule book. 
</P>
<P>
	In more than 700 races over four months, the 11 challenger teams  
score one point for each win in the first of three round-robins, 
four points in the second, nine in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of a finals series will meet Team New Zealand in a  
best-of-9 regatta for the America's Cup.

<HEADLINE> IBM Changes Aptiva PC Sale Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM, whose name has been synonymous with  
personal computers for nearly two decades, is pulling its 
money-losing line of PCs from retail stores in the United States 
and will sell them exclusively over the Internet, in a drastic move 
to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, the nation's third-largest PC maker, is the latest  
technology company to get squeezed by intense price wars and a 
surge in component costs. Dell Computer Corp. warned late Monday 
its third-quarter profits will be hurt by rising memory chip prices 
stemming from the Taiwan earthquake last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Aptiva PCs will disappear from stores starting Jan. 1, an IBM  
spokeswoman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure comes two weeks after the Armonk, N.Y., company  
told employees it would cut up to 10 percent of the 10,000-person 
staff in its PC business as it consolidates several brands -- 
including Aptiva PCs, ThinkPad laptops and Netfinity computer 
servers -- under one marketing umbrella. The unit, which sells PCs 
to both consumers and businesses, lost about $150 million in the 
second quarter and nearly $1 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will continue to sell its ThinkPad laptops, which  
are profitable, in retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM said it would evaluate its decision to take Aptivas off the  
shelves as it urgently tries to stem losses. Stores typically 
charge fees for displaying and promoting products. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM is releasing its third-quarter financial results late  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what the problem is, but we need to go back to  
the drawing boards and figure it out,'' said spokeswoman Trink 
Guarino. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM pioneered the home computer in the early 1980s when it  
started selling an affordable box-like device that sat on people's 
desks. Even though IBM was quickly overtaken by nimbler sellers of 
cheaper PCs, such as Compaq Computer Corp., home computers long 
were known as ``IBM clones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To differentiate its products, IBM introduced the Aptiva brand  
in 1994. But IBM has been struggling to repair its so-called 
Personal Systems Group for several years, and some analysts have 
even suggested that IBM should stop selling personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's move to sell PCs only over the Internet takes its cue from  
Dell, the largest seller of computers directly to customers. In 
addition to selling online, Dell has a sales force that sells 
computers to thousands of businesses. But by eliminating 
wholesalers and retailers for online sales, Dell has lured legions 
of loyal customers, fueled profits and prompted its largest 
competitors to become copycats. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Dell sells mostly business PCs to corporate customers, a  
more tech-savvy group that generally knows what type of computers 
to buy. Home computer users are more of a ``kick-the-tire'' crowd, 
preferring to try out a PC before buying it. In addition, selling 
consumer PCs only over the Internet will hurt IBM's brand 
visibility among everyday users. 
</P>
<P>
	To buoy awareness of the Aptiva brand and encourage people to  
visit its ShopIBM Web site, which it is redesigning, IBM plans to 
launch a $20 million advertising campaign early next year, 
including television and direct mail flyers.

<HEADLINE> Forbes: Polls Are 'Writing in Sand' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Steve Forbes has picked up the support of  
Pat Buchanan's 1992 and 1996 state campaign chairman and of two 
Christian Coalition county chairmen in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes told supporters not to be disheartened by polls showing  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush with a big lead in the Republican 
presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Polls right now are like writing in the sand,'' Forbes said.  
``When people start to really focus on this race, this campaign 
that you see here today has the grass-roots and committed people 
who want to make positive things happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush already has endorsements from many of the state's leading  
Republicans, and Arizona Sen. John McCain has spent much time in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' state campaign committee is headed by Secretary of State  
Jim Miles. It also includes two state legislators, Republican Reps. 
Liston Barfield of Conway and Dwight Loftis of Greenville. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee includes several people who worked on Buchanan's  
earlier campaigns, including Hank Harrison, state chairman in 1992 
and 1996, and the Christian Coalition county chairmen from 
Greenville and Spartanburg counties. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a group of people who know how to organize and  
mobilize and get votes out,'' Miles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, who is making a third run for the White House, is  
widely expected to abandon the GOP next week and seek the Reform 
Party presidential nomination.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Discusses Asian Crises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The development of strong bond markets to back  
up banking systems could have helped lessen the severity of the 
Asian currency crisis, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said the financial crisis that devastated Asian  
economies starting in 1997 could have been handled better if 
businesses had been able to raise money in capital markets after 
their banking systems got into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had a functioning capital market existed, along with all the  
necessary financial infrastructure, the outcome might have been far 
more benign,'' Greenspan told a banking conference sponsored by the 
Fed's Atlanta regional bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said global turmoil in the fall of 1998 did not derail  
the U.S. economy largely because American banks stepped in to 
replace the bond market as a source of business loans after bond 
investors backed away from buying new corporate debt issues caused 
by Russia's default on billions of dollars of foreign loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we perceived in the United States in 1998 may reflect an  
important general principle: Multiple alternatives to transform an 
economy's savings into capital investments act as backup 
facilities,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the major lessons of the Asian crises, he said, could be  
that economies are better able to withstand financial turmoil if 
they have a bond market that can provide lending when banks get in 
trouble and capital markets freeze up. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it is understandable that Asian economies, which had  
enjoyed three decades of phenomenally solid growth, would not have 
seen a need for a backup to their banking systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lack of a spare tire is of no concern if you do not get a  
flat,'' Greenspan said. ``East Asia had no spare tires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan covered many of the same areas in Tuesday's speech as  
in an earlier address to the annual meetings of the World Bank and 
International Monetary Fund last month in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that America's mild recession in 1990-91, the last U.S.  
downturn, could have been far more severe if bond investors had not 
been willing to step in to provide capital to businesses after bank 
lending dried up. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's prolonged economic troubles in this decade, reflect that  
its bond markets have not been able to replace banks and keep 
capital flowing to businesses, Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Diversity within the financial sector provides insurance  
against a financial problem turning into economy-wide distress,'' 
said Greenspan, who spoke through a teleconference hookup to the 
conference in Sea Island, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	During a question-and-answer session, Greenspan disagreed with  
suggestions that the global financial crisis pointed to a need for 
an international lender of last resort who would serve the same 
functions on a global scale as the Fed serves in providing 
resources to troubled U.S. banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be very fearful that in practice it could turn out to be  
most counterproductive,'' Greenspan said, indicating fears that 
such an institution would be tempted to flood the world financial 
system with money during times of trouble and invite higher 
inflation down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said a better approach would be for the United States  
and other major industrial countries to ``keep our own houses in 
order'' to help stabilize turbulent economic situations when they 
occur.

	Habibie's Chances Further Hampered  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's top legislative body  
Wednesday rejected President B.J. Habibie's defense of his record, 
apparently dooming his efforts to stay in office. The 700-member 
People's Consultative Assembly was to decide later Wednesday who 
will lead the world's fourth most-populous country for the next 
five years. Soon after, the special assembly endorsed East Timor's 
independence vote, paving the way for the half-island territory to 
become the world's newest nation. The legislators' narrow vote 
against Habibie could prompt the ruling Golkar Party to replace him 
as its presidential nominee.

Istanbul's Ataturk airport today, according to news reports. The 
Anatolia news agency said the plane, which had been destined for 
Cairo, was diverted to London. A lone man armed with a knife seized 
control of the plane shortly after it took off at 6:16 p.m., 
Anatolia and NTV television reported. The motive for the hijacking 
was not known. The NTV television report said the man first 
demanded to be taken to Hamburg, Germany, then ordered the plane

June, is touring the region as a private citizen -- albeit, a

Rican island of Vieques. At the same time, the chairman of the 
Senate Armed Services Committee said he regretted that the island 
had become so politicized. Francis Rush, the chairman of the 
presidential panel, defended the group's conclusion that bombing 
should be allowed to resume on the island, but at a reduced level -- 
and that the range should be closed entirely within five years.

<HEADLINE> Russia Vows To End Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's prime minister opened a multination  
conference today with a pledge to stop Russian money-laundering at 
the source and to prevent criminal funds from being funneled 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is prepared to ``tightly seal all sources of dirty money  
on its territory,'' Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said. ``We are 
interested in preventing dirty money from Russia from being 
laundered in foreign banks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he also rejected what he called speculation on Russia's role  
in international money-laundering. Russian officials have said 
repeatedly that media allegations that billions of dollars in 
Russian funds were laundered through the Bank of New York were 
exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. prosecutors have charged three people with conspiring from  
1996 through August 1999 to illegally channel $7 billion from 
Russia through accounts at the Bank of New York. If true, it would 
be one of the largest money-laundering schemes in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian government has angrily dismissed claims of possible  
official involvement and described the scandal as a product of 
anti-Russian media and political circles in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	But it has said it would cooperate with U.S. and other  
investigators, and Putin's address indicated that Russia wanted to 
take an active role in the fight to stop money-laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	However, his vow to stem the flow of dirty money will be  
difficult to achieve in practice due to the country's tangled tax 
and legal systems and the huge amount of organized crime believed 
to be plaguing Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno, who is in Moscow, met with Putin  
today and said U.S. officials are eager to cooperate with their 
Russian counterparts in battling money-laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vast amounts of money move around the world and I'm very  
gratified by the commitment of the chairman (Putin), by the 
introduction of legislation, and most of all by his thoughtful 
appreciation of our comments and our suggestions,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter of greeting to the conference, President Boris  
Yeltsin called on participating countries to cooperate in their 
efforts to fight terrorism and organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today crime has crossed state borders. It has become a serious  
challenge to the stability and future not of individual countries 
but of all mankind,'' Yeltsin's statement said, according to the 
ITAR-Tass news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin said that a series of apartment bombings in Russia, as  
well as bombings in Kenya and Israel, ``make us look anew at the 
problem of international terrorism, at its sources and the global 
threat that it poses to world security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the conference, Putin also said the participants needed to  
work together because ``terrorism drug trafficking, illicit arms 
trade and the slave trade can't be eradicated by exclusively 
national means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conference was conceived at a May 1998 summit of the  
so-called Group of Eight -- the seven major industrial nations and 
Russia -- and will run through Wednesday. It is being attended by 
top interior and justice officials from Russia, Britain, Germany, 
France, Italy, Canada, the United States and Japan.

	PRINCETON, Ind. (AP) -- A new Toyota sport utility vehicle to be  
built here has a name now: Sequoia. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Press, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales USA  
Inc., announced the name to journalists attending the Tokyo Motor 
Show on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Production of the full-size SUV, which will be introduced as a  
2001 model, is scheduled to begin next September. The first 
vehicles are expected to reach dealer showrooms soon afterward, 
said Mike Goss, a spokesman for the Toyota Motor Manufacturing 
Indiana Inc. plant in Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sequoia, like the new Tundra full-size pickup truck that  
went on sale in North America on June 1, will be built exclusively 
at the plant, which is about 30 miles north of Evansville in 
southwestern Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Annual production capacity at the sprawling, $1.2 billion  
manufacturing complex is about 100,000 trucks and 50,000 SUVs. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Corp., the Japanese parent of Torrance,  
Calif.-based Toyota Motor Sales USA, announced plans for the 
vehicle in September 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sequoia will feature the same V-8 engine found in the Tundra  
and the Toyota Land Cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sequoia will join the company's lineup of SUVs that also  
includes the compact RAV4, the mid-size 4Runner and the full-size 
Land Cruiser. None of the other SUVs are built in North America.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Reveals Weapons Locations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon for the first time is  
acknowledging Cold War locations of nuclear weapons outside the 
United States, including naval depth bombs, ready for arming, in 
Cuba during the 1962 missile crisis with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The names of nine places where bombs or bomb components minus  
their nuclear charges were located between 1951 and 1977 are 
revealed in a 332-page official Pentagon history. The names of 18 
other locations were blacked out by government censors before the 
document was released to Robert S. Norris, a private specialist on 
nuclear weapons and author of numerous books on the topic. 
</P>
<P>
	Using other documents, Norris and his co-authors said they could  
identify 17 of those other locations, ringing the globe from Canada 
to Iceland to South Korea and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine nuclear weapon locations named in the Pentagon document  
are Cuba, Puerto Rico, Britain, West Germany, the U.S. territories 
of Guam, Johnston Island and Midway, and Alaska and Hawaii, which 
were U.S. territories in the early years of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with material blacked out, the ``History of the Custody and  
Deployment of Nuclear Weapons,'' published in February 1978 as a 
top secret document, reveals new information about the location, 
timing and types of U.S. nuclear weapon deployments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows a huge expanse of nuclear weapons around the globe,''  
Norris said in an interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The narrative portion of the Pentagon history makes no reference  
to U.S. nuclear weapons in Cuba, but an appendix listing locations 
outside the continental United States says an unspecified number of 
``non-nuclear depth bombs'' were stored in Cuba between December 
1961 and July-September 1963. The crisis over Moscow's stationing 
of surface-to-air nuclear missiles in Cuba was in October 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	The term ``non-nuclear'' referred to components, such as bomb  
casings or assemblies, for nuclear weapons, the report said. At 
that time, bomb design technology required that the actual nuclear 
charge, or capsule, be kept separate from the non-nuclear assembly. 
In the event of war, capsules could be flown to bases where they 
would be inserted into the assemblies to make complete bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Depth bombs were weapons dropped from airplanes or helicopters  
to dive into the sea to kill submarines. The last of this kind of 
nuclear weapon was retired from the U.S. arsenal early in this 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham Allison, a former Pentagon official who is an expert on  
the Cuban missile crisis, said in a telephone interview he was not 
aware that nuclear weapon components had been stored in Cuba. He 
said they probably were at Guantanamo Bay, a U.S. Navy base on the 
eastern tip of the island. During the Cuban missile crisis the Navy 
searched intensively for Soviet submarines in the Atlantic, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Details about locations of American nuclear weapons abroad are  
among the most closely protected Pentagon secrets. Today the only 
remaining full-time U.S. nuclear deployments outside the United 
States are in Europe, where bombs are stored for potential use by 
U.S. Air Force planes based there. The Pentagon also has U.S.-based 
submarines, aircraft and missiles armed with nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris, who wrote an article about the nuclear weapons history  
to be published this week in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists 
with co-authors William Arkin and William Burr, said the three used 
publicly available documentation to determine the names of 17 of 
the 18 censored locations. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17 were Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Japan, Kwajalein Island,  
Morocco, Okinawa, the Philippines, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, 
Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey. It has 
been known that U.S. nuclear weapons were in some of these 
countries, even if not officially acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	With the onset in 1950 of the Korean War, which many in  
Washington believed was a Soviet-driven move to divert U.S. 
attention from its defense of Europe, the Truman administration 
approved the movement of non-nuclear bomb components to Britain, 
and later that year to Guam, according to the Pentagon history. 
</P>
<P>
	``By having non-nuclear components readily available to these  
units, the initial strikes against their assigned targets could be 
mounted in a much shorter time, and the time schedule for 
subsequent attacks could be advanced,'' the document said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first overseas movement of nuclear capsules -- the bomb's  
plutonium or uranium core -- came in 1951 when President Truman 
authorized the shipment of nuclear capsules to the Pacific island 
of Guam. Starting in 1956 a wide variety of nuclear weapons and 
their delivery systems were sent to the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	On Guam there were, for example, Regulus cruise missiles that  
would be launched from a ship and guided by an escort plane. There 
also were shipboard Talos anti-aircraft missiles and a variety of 
Army battlefield nuclear weapons. Similar weapons were placed in 
Hawaii, mostly during the late 1950s and early 1960s. In Alaska 
there were several types, including the Genie air-to-air nuclear 
missile.

<HEADLINE> Air Canada, Partners Fight Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Air Canada and its major global airline partners,  
United Airlines and Lufthansa, struck an agreement intended to 
prevent Onex Corp. of Canada from taking over the nation's two 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Milton, Air Canada's president and chief executive,  
announced today that Lufthansa and United Airlines would make a 
$493 million bid for 35 percent of Air Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Montreal-based carrier will offer to buy its  
major local competitor, Canadian Airlines, and operate the 
Calgary-based airline as a separate company, Milton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves were designed to counter the $1.2 billion that Onex  
has offered for the shares of the two Canadian airlines that would 
be merged into one national carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Onex's offer would result in the loss of about 5,000 jobs, while  
only about 2,500 jobs would be cut under the plan Air Canada 
favors. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada's shareholders are scheduled to vote on the Onex bid  
at a Nov. 8 meeting in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have taken the time to craft a solution that is realistic,  
practical and built on the potential of Canada's airlines,'' said a 
statement issued by Milton in Montreal. ``It constitutes a dynamic 
solution for a sustainable, profitable, competitive and 
Canadian-controlled airline industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has touched several sensitive business and political  
nerves in Canada, including fears of growing U.S. dominance over 
Canadian enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada claims the Onex bid is a thinly disguised attempt by  
American Airlines to gain control of Canadian skies. AMR Corp., 
American Airlines' parent company which is backing the Onex bid, 
now owns 25 percent of Canadian Airlines and would own 15 percent 
of the new, merged airline. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR chairman Donald Carty says American has no interest in  
running a Canadian airline. What it wants are routes to Asia from 
Vancouver and to Europe from Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle pits global air alliances against each other.  
American's Oneworld, with partners like Canadian Airlines, Quantas 
of Australia and British Airways, is bidding against the Star 
Alliance, with United Airlines, Air Canada and Germany's Lufthansa. 
</P>
<P>
	These integrated networks allow travelers to accumulate and  
redeem frequent-flyer points on any of the allied airlines. 
Travelers can also buy a ticket through one carrier to the 
destinations of any of its partners, allowing each airline to offer 
hundreds of international destinations. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Onex merger plan, American and Oneworld would come out  
on top, shutting out United and Star Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union has questioned the Onex plan, saying it would  
hinder competition for flights between London and Canadian 
airports. The EU's top antitrust official said today Air Canada and 
Canadian Airlines Corp. will have to release landing and take-off 
slots for transatlantic flights to secure clearance from EU 
regulators for the Onex merger plan. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the EU noted that government agreements authorize  
only British Airways and the two Canadian carriers to fly direct 
between Canada and London's Heathrow airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto-based Onex offered $1.2 billion in cash and stock to  
take over the Canadian carriers in August. It would also assume 
$2.7 billion in debt.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Turning Off New York Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton's unofficial  
Senate candidacy is turning off the New York media, as well as some 
local Republican officials. 
</P>
<P>
	WRNN-TV, based in Kingston, said Tuesday it ``will no longer  
cover Hillary Clinton's ``listening tour'' until she declares 
herself a candidate and grants interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a decision was not the first by a New York media outlet.  
</P>
<P>
	Whitney Radio, which operates two stations in New Rochelle, also  
has said it would discontinue coverage of the first lady's ``staged 
events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Mrs. Clinton said she would not give one-on-one  
interviews until ``after the first of the year,'' when she expects 
to make up her mind about running. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters were barred from questioning her Tuesday at a  
groundbreaking in New Rochelle, as well as during her Monday visit 
to a community center in Rockland County. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard French, WRNN's general manager, said, ``In our half-hour  
newscast, should we be replaying comments from a stand-up without 
any answering to the questions? We had questions about the dairy 
compact, her position on gambling, etc. ... I had to ask, 'Is it 
the best use of our news time?' And the answer was 'no.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, said: ``It's  
unfortunate when news organizations choose to inject themselves 
into politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But French, a Democrat, said Mrs. Clinton's politics played no  
role in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The Whitney stations had a reporter cover the first lady  
Tuesday, but company president William O'Shaughnessy, a Republican, 
said that was only because the groundbreaking -- for a luxury 
apartment building -- was of local interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Rockland County Republican Committee Chairman Vincent  
Reda has asked the state attorney general to investigate whether 
services that local, county and state agencies provided to Mrs. 
Clinton were ``improperly paid for'' by local taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	He said local police and state troopers were assigned to her  
three stops in the county on Monday ``so that she could move from 
location to location when carrying out her political dealings and 
while also deliberately and by design remaining out of reach of the 
general public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such police assignments are common for a first lady, but Reda  
said the visit was ``political campaigning and fund raising by a 
winking candidate who is here under the guise of first lady 
humanitarianism.'' A fund-raiser was held Monday night at the home 
of the county Democratic leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfson acknowledged that the trip was campaign-related and said  
Mrs. Clinton's campaign assumed its cost -- which does not include 
the price of local police protection. 
</P>
<P>
	He also wondered whether Reda would ask for an investigation of  
Republican New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who also is 
holding fund-raisers for a possible Senate run that could pit him 
against Mrs. Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Wacky End to Cowboys-Giants Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- New York Giants coach Jim Fassel's  
memories of ``The Play'' nearly resulted in ``The Play II.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Cowboys came oh so close Monday night to duplicating  
Cal's lateral-filled kickoff return for a touchdown against 
Stanford in 1982, only to be foiled when a forward lateral 
nullified the play. 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel, an assistant on that losing Stanford team, wanted to  
squib the kickoff, but special teams coach Larry Mac Duff convinced 
him to let Brad Daluiso kick high and short. That would allow the 
defenders to get downfield to cover Deion Sanders more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in '82, Stanford squibbed the ball with disastrous results.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing that was going through my mind was that I was  
in Stanford for that Stanford-Cal fiasco through the band and 
everything else,'' Fassel said. ``We on-sided that one and that was 
all I could visualize right there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monday night's game ended with the Giants winning 13-10, but  
Daluiso tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee trying 
to make a tackle at the Giants 15. He will be lost for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second time this type of play has had a nightmarish  
ending for Fassel. The Giants coach was a member of Stanford 
coaching staff in 1982 when California used a slew of laterals to 
return a squib kick for a game-winning TD, with the final 20 yards 
or so being run through the Cardinal band. 
</P>
<P>
	That memory influenced Fassel's decision on the kickoff after  
Daluiso kicked a go-ahead 21-yard field goal with one second to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	So Daluiso popped it up, but he hit it too far, right to Sanders  
at the Cowboys 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kicked it too deep,'' Daluiso said. ``I even told the guys  
on the field that I was going to pop it up even shorter than 
normal. My only fear was they would fair catch it and take a free 
kick and tie the game. It went a little too far, the adrenaline was 
flowing and they broke it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders fielded the ball, broke to his right and then reversed  
his field. With Giants defenders closing in at around the 25-yard 
line, Sanders tossed the ball to Kevin Mathis, but the ball clearly 
was a yard or two forward and a yellow flag was thrown for a 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was close, it could have gone either way,'' Sanders said.  
``That was so pretty, you got to let that go. It was good for the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mathis kept going, sprinting into the clear with a cut across  
the field from left to right. The only one standing in his way was 
Daluiso. He attempted to make tackle around the New York 15, but 
Mathis lateraled to Singor Mobley, who completed the run to the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Daluiso wrapped his arms around Mathis and fell to the ground in  
pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw the flag,'' Daluiso said. ``I could have said: `I'll  
take my chances and let the guy go.' But I had to try. Obviously, 
tackling isn't my forte. I'll come back stronger than I was this 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daluiso felt his cleats caught in the turf. He said his  
side-to-side mobility has decreased in recent years because kicking 
doesn't involve much of that. 
</P>
<P>
	He hobbled off the field as the Giants celebrated their win.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fine,'' Daluiso said. ``They told me I tore my ACL.  
We'll know more tomorrow. This is all new to me. I have never been 
hurt. Makes me feel kind of tough. I feel like I'm a little bit of 
a football player. I guarantee I looked kind of clumsy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daluiso entered this season as the Giants career leader in  
field-goal accuracy (77.3 percent). He was 7-of-9 on field goals 
this season, including 2-of-2 against the Cowboys. His kickoffs 
were also among the best in the league, with seven of his 18 going 
for touchbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge loss,'' Giants punter Brad Maynard said. ``John  
Mara (Giants executive vice president) just said he felt like we 
lost the game. We won the game, but we lost a key player for 
sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Fassel, it also felt like another loss, just like it did 17  
years ago when Cal lateraled its way to a 25-20 win through the 
band.

<HEADLINE> Arizona's Recker Reflects on Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The long scar on the left side of Luke  
Recker's face is evidence of his awful summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally settling in at Arizona, where he transferred after two  
stormy seasons under Bob Knight at Indiana, Recker said living 
through last July's car crash has made him appreciate how fortunate 
he is. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really value life,'' he said. ``I value waking up every  
morning. I realize how lucky I am, how many people would love to be 
in my situation and be able to play basketball at this level. ... 
I'm just lucky to be alive, let alone playing basketball here at 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize that life is short, and it is fragile, so I want to  
give my best effort in everything I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recker was a prep sensation in basketball-crazy Indiana, a  
winner of the coveted Mr. Basketball award. At 15, just a high 
school sophomore, he committed to playing for Knight, a decision he 
came to regret. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, he averaged 16.2 points as a sophomore for the  
Hoosiers but wanted to leave Knight's iron command. 
</P>
<P>
	He considered North Carolina, Florida, Iowa and Notre Dame, but  
settled on Arizona. He felt he could win a national championship 
there, and he liked the relationship coach Lute Olson seemed to 
build with his players. 
</P>
<P>
	He also noticed the way Olson's best players succeeded in the  
NBA. Recker felt Olson would best allow him to develop into a 
shooting guard, his best chance of making it as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, on July 10 on a highway near Durango, Colo., a truck  
veered across the center lane and sideswiped a car in which Recker 
was a passenger. The driver of the car was killed. Recker's 
girlfriend, Kelly Craig, was partially paralyzed by a spinal cord 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing that life can change in a heartbeat,'' Recker  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the laceration near his ear, Recker dislocated several  
small bones at the base of his left thumb and still has not fully 
recovered from the surgery. He can take part in some drills, but 
won't be cleared for full participation for another month. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker's girlfriend was to have moved with him to Arizona.  
Instead, she has been undergoing rehabilitation in Chicago. She 
recently moved home, but may have to return to the rehab center. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talk every night on the phone, but still it's really,  
really tough to deal with,'' Recker said. ``She's steadily 
improving, but spinal cord injuries are so slow. It's an injury 
where it's tough to see progress even though there is. It's just 
something you never expect to happen, and we're hoping and praying 
for the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recker decided not to change his plans to transfer, even though  
it meant leaving his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it was tough leaving home in the situation that  
occurred,'' he said. ``But at the same time, I needed to continue 
to go on with my life and keep trying to be the best I can. I'll be 
there for Kelly by talking to her on the phone, but it was 
important for me to get out here and get adjusted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recker never heard from anyone on the Indiana coaching staff  
after the accident, but he talks regularly with several players, 
including best friend Dane Fife. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, he has fit in quickly with his new teammates.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good guy. He's real personable so he's easy to get  
along with,'' Arizona senior guard Josh Pastner said. ``It's good 
therapy for him because he's around the game of basketball and 
around his teammates. We realize that this guy's been through a 
lot. Everyone's behind him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Recker must sit and watch his teammates play. He won't be  
eligible until next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be very, very difficult for me,'' he said. ``I  
knew it was going to be hard when I left Indiana, but now I'm 
really itching to be playing again in a game, and it's going to be 
a lot more difficult than I expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olson said Recker can be a big help to the team just by his  
presence and his performance in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``His experience and mental toughness will be important for us  
as the season goes on,'' Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patience is just the latest lesson in a year of tough ones for  
Recker. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been pretty lonely because I've left my surroundings and  
my friends and I'm starting all over again -- learning even where 
the closest Burger King is,'' he said. ``It's all new to me, but 
I've developed a good relationship with the guys on the team. 
They've been great, and the people in general have been great. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be tough to sit out this year, but when my time  
comes, I'll be ready.''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Drop Balls, Lose Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A routine throw ticked off first baseman Mike  
Stanley's mitt. A potential double-play grounder rolled to the 
wrong spot, second baseman Jose Offerman's glove. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Boston Red Sox season trickled away in a record-breaking  
display of fielding futility. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a situation where they weren't mental mistakes,'' Boston  
center fielder Darren Lewis said. ``They're just physical mistakes. 
Nobody tries to do that. They just happened at the wrong time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox might have been eliminated anyway Monday night. New  
York pitcher Orlando Hernandez was that strong. But the Yankees got 
help from Boston's weak fielding for the second straight night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox committed four errors in Sunday night's 9-2 loss and  
two in Monday night's 6-1 setback that gave the Yankees a 4-1 
victory in the best-of-7 AL Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you start giving a team three or four extra outs a game,  
it can come back to bite you and it did,'' Red Sox reliever Derek 
Lowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's 10 errors set a record for an LCS of any length. Nomar  
Garciaparra, who committed two errors on Sunday, ended the series 
one short of the ALCS record for shortstops of five errors set by 
Boston's Spike Owen in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Boston had a decent shot at a comeback in the finale  
as it trailed 2-0 through six innings. But the Red Sox had the AL's 
third worst fielding team this season and it was easy to see why in 
the seventh inning when two errors led to two runs. 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed the parka-clad fans made better use of their gloves on  
a chilly October night at windy Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	With one out in the seventh, Garciaparra cleanly fielded Derek  
Jeter's grounder. The throw was on target, but Stanley muffed it. 
Instead of two outs and no runners, Jeter was on second with one 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul O'Neill's single sent Jeter to third and a walk to Bernie  
Williams loaded the bases. Chili Davis then hit the grounder to 
Offerman. 
</P>
<P>
	Had there been two outs, he could have thrown to Stanley to end  
the inning. With only one out, he still could have ended the threat 
by throwing to Garciaparra to start a double play. But Offerman 
never caught the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter scored on that play and O'Neill scored on Tino Martinez's  
single that made it 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
	It was just one inning of ineptitude, but it was costly. Just  
like Boston's fielding problems in the ninth inning of Game 4 
allowed New York to pull away. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees led 3-2 going into that inning. But errors by  
Offerman and Lewis, one of baseball's best fielding outfielders, 
contributed to a sixth-run ninth in which pinch-hitter Ricky Ledee 
capitalized with a grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't take credit away from them for coming up with the  
big hits,'' Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees scored two other runs in the fourth when  
Garciaparra, who had a career-low 17 errors this season, and 
starting pitcher Bret Saberhagen made errors. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last two games, New York scored 13 runs but only three in  
innings in which the Red Sox made no errors. The Yankees committed 
five errors but they weren't nearly as costly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed when they made a few errors they got out of the  
situation,'' Saberhagen said. ``When we made a few errors, we 
didn't.''

<HEADLINE> SEC Cracking Down on Leaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Seeking to narrow the knowledge gap between  
large finanical institutions and small-time investors, federal 
regulators will prod companies to share information that until now 
has been reserved for Wall Street analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The behind-the-scenes feeding of ... (significant) information  
from companies to analysts is a stain on our markets,'' Securities 
and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt said in a speech to 
an economists' group Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The analysts' clients, such as big institutional investors, can  
gain an unfair advantage because companies' financial data and 
forecasts often push stock prices up or down and their clients can 
trade ahead of others. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within the next few months, we will consider proposing rules  
to close the gap between those in the so-called 'know' and the rest 
of us in the public,'' Levitt said, but did not go into detail. He 
said there was ``no simple regulatory or legal fix to this 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking in Manhattan at the Economic Club of New York, Levitt  
also called on corporate America to open to everyone its quarterly 
conference calls with financial analysts by posting them on the 
Internet and inviting the press. 
</P>
<P>
	In an era when information flows freely and instantly, he added,  
``these sorts of whispers are an insult to fair and public 
disclosure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 13 percent of big, publicly traded companies already  
transmit their conference calls publicly over the Internet, said 
Lou Thompson, president and chief executive officer of the National 
Investor Relations Institute, a group representing company 
officials who deal with shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most discussions between companies and analysts are above  
board, they are legal and they do not constitute selective 
disclosure,'' Thompson said in a telephone interview. ``There are 
exceptions ... but it isn't a common problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Spellman, a spokesman for the Securities Industry  
Association, said the Wall Street group was discussing the issue 
with the SEC regulators. ``Public trust and confidence are the 
industry's biggest priorities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC officials have stepped up criticism in recent weeks of what  
they see as efforts by some company executives to curry favor with 
analysts by giving them data in advance of officially announcing 
quarterly earnings or other financial news. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt also has been pushing companies to improve their  
financial reporting and avoid manipulating their earnings to meet 
analysts' projections. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the SEC accused 68 people and companies -- including  
Hall of Fame quarterback and Atlanta businessman Fran Tarkenton -- 
of accounting fraud in the first nationwide ``sweep'' against 
inflating earnings and other alleged reporting misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt also pointed out that analysts can be compromised by  
being paid in proportion to the profits of their firm, which often 
has substantial dealings why the companies they study. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it any wonder that today, a `sell' recommendation from an  
analyst is as common as a Barbra Streisand concert?'' he asked 
rhetorically, and said firms should look at the way analysts are 
paid.

<HEADLINE> America's Cup Enters Third Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Dawn Riley's America True won an  
intense tacking duel and veteran Dennis Conner defeated the 
Japanese team on Wednesday in the challengers series for the 
America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	In a morning of tight racing for all but the top favorites,  
America True, with the only woman skipper of the competition, and 
Hawaii's Abracadabra 2000 tacked more than 20 times on the second 
windward leg before the San Franciscans scraped over the line for 
their second victory of the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Conner's Stars and Stripes, with half the budget and half the  
number of boats of his rival, led the $20 million, two-boat Nippon 
team at all four marks in a close race, crossing the line more than 
one minute ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian Prada team and the New York Yacht Club's Young  
America again had easy victories, while Australia, with the 
youngest team, smallest budget and oldest boat, posted its first 
victory of the series, over the Swiss team. 
</P>
<P>
	As killer whales frolicked in the inner harbor, further out on  
Auckland's Hauraki Gulf wind blew steadily at 10-15 knots, the most 
consistent breeze in the competition so far. 
</P>
<P>
	In the morning races, Prada defeated the Spanish challenge by 1  
minute, 2 seconds; Stars and Stripes defeated Nippon by 1 minute, 
14 seconds; Young America defeated Le Defi Francais by 2 minutes, 4 
seconds; America True defeated Abracadabra by 26 seconds; and Young 
Australia defeated Fast 2000 by 12 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The afternoon pairings: Le Defi Francais vs. AmericaOne; Young  
Australia vs. Nippon; Abracadabra vs. Spanish challenge; America 
True vs. Prada; Stars and Stripes vs. Fast 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Young America and Prada each have five victories in as many  
starts. Paul Cayard's AmericaOne, idle Wednesday morning, has won 
four of four. 
</P>
<P>
	In more than 700 races over four months, the 11 challenger teams  
score one point for each victory in the first of three 
round-robins, four points in the second and nine in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of a finals series will meet Team New Zealand in a  
best-of-9 regatta starting in February 2000 for sailing's most 
prized trophy, the America's Cup.

<HEADLINE> Gulf War Report Raises Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Pentagon-financed study concludes that a  
drug given to U.S. troops during the Persian Gulf war to protect 
against a nerve gas cannot be ruled out as a possible cause for 
what has come to be known as Gulf War syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Department officials were presenting the 385-page review  
of scientific literature on the drug pyriostigmine bromide, or PB, 
at a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
	Prepared By Beatrice Alexandra Golomb of Rand Corp., a  
California think tank, the study says PB ``cannot be ruled out'' as 
a cause of lingering illnesses in some veterans of the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	``This does not imply that it is necessarily a causal factor,  
only that the possibility cannot be dismissed,'' she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The author is a physician at San Diego Veterans Affairs Medical  
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the cautious nature of the conclusion, the Rand review  
of about 1,000 published studies on the drug gives somewhat more 
credence to the hypothesis that it could cause or contribute to 
Gulf War syndrome, a vague array of symptoms including chronic 
pain, digestive problems, nausea, skin rashes, fatigue, aching 
joints, memory loss and concentration problems. 
</P>
<P>
	PB was given to an estimated 300,000 soldiers during the war as  
protection against the nerve gas soman. The Pentagon has earmarked 
about $20 million, of $133 million spent researching Gulf War 
syndrome, specifically to study the effects of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post, The New York Times and the Los Angeles  
Times all reported on the Rand review in advance of today's news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a `Eureka,''' Dr. Sue Bailey, assistant secretary  
of defense for health affairs, told the Los Angeles paper. 
</P>
<P>
	She said PB is still considered an invaluable tool against  
poison gas and will continue to be used. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is life and death versus the possibility of some long-term  
side effects,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Quake Fault Lines Said Conversating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The weekend's 7.1-magnitude earthquake  
in the southern California desert produced a nerve-rattling 
conversation between two of the state's fault lines, scientists 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after Saturday morning's massive Hector Mine quake tore a  
25-mile-long gash from a dry lake through the Mojave Desert, some 
seismologists were alarmed by a series of earthquakes as powerful 
as 4.0 that struck 120 miles away near the Salton Sea, a few miles 
from the massive San Andreas Fault. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very clear that the faults in this area are talking to  
each other,'' said Lucy Jones, a U.S. Geological Survey 
seismologist. ``It's not clear what exactly that pattern is,'' so 
scientists can't predict another quake resulting from this one. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's largest temblor, which struck at 2:46 a.m. in a  
sparsely populated stretch of desert, caused minor injuries on an 
Amtrak train that derailed. Scientists upgraded the quake's 
magnitude from 7.0 to 7.1 on Monday -- a 25 percent increase in 
shaking. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday night, the Hector quake generated two more aftershocks  
in the area where the original temblor struck. 
</P>
<P>
	A 4.0-magnitude quake centered 37 miles from Baker and a  
4.1-magnitude quake 18 miles from Joshua Tree were recorded at 7:38 
p.m., said Karen Kahler, a seismologist at the California Institute 
of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Although most seismologists say there is no connection among the  
large quakes that have occurred recently around the world, some 
experts are considering links between the Hector quake and a 
7.5-magnitude temblor that killed 27 people in Mexico last month, 
said Kate Hutton, another seismologist at CalTech. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a small minority who believe there may be a  
connection,'' she said. Hutton said she found the link between the 
Salton Sea and Hector quakes ``more likely,'' considering the 
relative close distance between them. 
</P>
<P>
	While most temblors trigger other quakes in the immediate  
vicinity, large earthquakes can have far-reaching effects, Jones 
said. In 1992, a 7.3-magnitude quake in Landers, Calif., was 
responsible for quakes as far away as Yellowstone National Park in 
Wyoming, she said.

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid CEO Steps Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP HILL, Pa. (AP) -- Rite Aid Corp.'s shares shot up almost 19  
percent during trading today as it shopped for a new chairman and 
chief executive to nurse the nation's third-largest drug store 
chain back to health. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin L. Grass, whose father founded the company more than 40  
years ago, resigned Monday amid a company struggle to overcome a 
mountain of debt accumulated through rapid expansion in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass, who took over the company in 1995, has also faced  
questions that he held stakes in several suppliers and real estate 
interests that do business with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid's stock has slipped more than 80 percent this year, as  
the company has repeatedly had to restate downward its previous 
years' earnings. In its first trading since the announcement, it 
rose $1.81 1/4 to $11.43 3/4 a share by this afternoon on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy J. Noonan, the company's president and chief operating  
officer, was appointed interim chief executive officer while the 
search for a permanent successor to Grass continues. 
</P>
<P>
	Noonan, a 30-year Rite aid veteran, said the willingness of the  
company's agent banks to extend its line of credit for one year and 
the commitment of a $300 million infusion from investment banking 
firm Leonard Green &AMP; Partners will provide ``a firm financial 
base'' for Rite Aid's future plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident that all our constituencies -- shareholders,  
vendors, management, pharmacists and associates -- should find 
reassurance in today's announcement'' said Noonan, 57, in a 
statement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Grass, 45, who also is giving up his position as a Rite Aid  
director, led the company through a major acquisition campaign in 
recent years but has acknowledged in recent months that it was 
overly ambitious. 
</P>
<P>
	To slash its nearly $5.1 billion in debt, Rite Aid is trying to  
sell dozens of its West Coast stores and has signaled a willingness 
to sell at least part of its interest in pharmacy-benefits manager 
PCS Health Systems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's announcement came a week after the Camp Hill-based  
company reported a second-quarter loss of $67.9 million, which it 
blamed on costs associated with closing stores and acquiring PCS. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid closed or moved 106 stores during the quarter. Also  
hurting the results was a $49 million increase in interest costs 
related to financing for the January acquisition of PCS, the 
retailer said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also announced its restated financial results for the past  
three fiscal years will result in about $500 million drop in prior 
years' earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid, which ranks third in sales behind Walgreen and CVS,  
operates about 3,900 stores in 30 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Grass took Rite Aid's reins from his dad, Alex, in 1995.  
A year later the company bought Thrifty PayLess (with more than 
1,000 stores) for about $2.3 billion. The deal took the company 
into new western territory. 
</P>
<P>
	In late 1998 Rite Aid bought competitor PCS Health Systems, a  
giant pharmacy benefits manager, from drugmaker Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. for 
$1.5 billion. But Rite Aid recently said it was exploring selling 
PCS in part to pay back its debts. 
</P>
<P>
	After revising three years of earnings, in June, Rite Aid  
announced that its CFO, Frank Bergonzi, will retire before year's 
end.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Verdict To Be Issued Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first phase of the judge's verdict in the  
Microsoft Corp. antitrust trial will be issued on an upcoming 
Friday evening, court officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But they didn't indicate which Friday, suggesting a decision  
might still not be announced for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said  
his factual findings will be issued at 6:30 p.m. on a Friday, 
adding that lawyers in the case will be notified two hours earlier 
that a decision is ready. 
</P>
<P>
	But even lawyers won't know the outcome until it's publicly  
disclosed that evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing suggests that the judge may be concerned about the  
impact of his ruling on the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the trial, Jackson commented that America Online  
Inc.'s $10 billion purchase of the former Netscape Communications 
Corp. was possibly a ``very significant change in the playing 
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within minutes of the judge's remarks, Microsoft's stock jumped  
sharply as investors interpreted them as favorable toward the 
company in the trial's outcome.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Web Site Hit by Prank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- An Internet site used by teachers across  
the country recently included what looked like a note from a 
teacher admitting he molested children and dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	But it turned out to be a prank by a student at the teacher's  
high school in East Greenwich, police say. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-year-old student was charged on Oct. 6 with the use of  
false computer information, a misdemeanor, and could be expelled. 
He was released to the custody of his parents and is due to appear 
before the East Greenwich juvenile hearing board this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The prank has the owners of SchoolNotes.com wondering how they  
can increase security on the Web site, which is used by about 
25,000 teachers to post curriculum information and homework 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricardo Valencia, a spokesman for Copernicus Interactive, which  
owns SchoolNotes.com, said the company is ``appalled'' by the boy's 
act and ``very concerned about students being able to access or to 
hack their way onto the Web site.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers must subscribe to the service to post information.  
Posing as the teacher, the student created an account in the 
teacher's name and posted the note, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither was identified.  
</P>
<P>
	Another teacher at the school discovered the note and informed  
school authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The student has admitted to the crime, said East Greenwich  
police Det. Lt. William Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thought it would be a funny prank for him and his friends  
to view,'' he said.

Romania. But Romanians know him.

	Hagman's ``Dallas'' was one of the few American TV series the

<HEADLINE> Mets Die, But Not Without Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- They had trouble believing it was over.  
</P>
<P>
	John Franco's eyes were red. Turk Wendell's, too.  
</P>
<P>
	When Kenny Rogers walked over to his locker, Wendell gave him a  
big bear hug. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything you've done in the past, they'll forget about and  
remember this,'' Rogers said Tuesday night after he walked in the 
winning run in the 11th inning, giving the Atlanta Braves an 
unforgettable 10-9 victory over the Mets and a 4-2 victory in the 
NL Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``That,'' said Rogers, who once pitched a perfect game, `is just  
the way it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like vampires, these New York Mets refused to die, bouncing back  
again and again after hope had all but vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	Starter Al Leiter had nothing left Tuesday night, allowing his  
first five batters to score, and still the Mets came back from a 
5-0 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so typical of what's gone on,'' Leiter said. ``I thought  
for sure we would win this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York tied the score with three runs in the sixth and four  
more in the seventh, took an 8-7 lead on Melvin Mora's RBI single 
in the eighth and a 9-8 lead on Todd Pratt's sacrifice fly in the 
10th. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, Franco blew it by allowing Brian Hunter's RBI single in the  
bottom of the eighth. And Armando Benitez blew it again in the 
10th, wasting Pratt's sacrifice fly by allowing Ozzie Guillen's 
run-scoring single in the bottom half. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the time Rogers walked Andruw Jones on a 3-2 pitch with  
the bases loaded, the Mets had made their mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a big boy,'' Rogers said. ``I can handle it. God thinks I  
can handle a lot. He can lay off me now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This team will be remembered not for failing to become the first  
team to overcome a 3-0 postseason deficit, but for its spellbinding 
twists and turns, the collapses and comebacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets had stirred so much hope with their amazin' turnaround  
on the season's final weekend, their tiebreaker playoff win at 
Cincinnati, their upset first-round victory over Arizona, with 
Pratt circling the bases with only the fourth homer that ended a 
postseason series. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came that 15-inning win Sunday on Ventura's  
grand-slam-turned-single, a game that forever will be remembered 
among baseball's best. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think every guy in this room should be proud of the way we  
handled ourselves,'' Franco said. ``We're champions in our own 
hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 25 pitches by Leiter, it threatened to all come undone. For  
just the second time in 210 career starts, regular and postseason 
combined, he failed to get a single out. He called it the ``poorest 
start of my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But then the Mets, trying to create the first Subway Series  
since 1956, mounted their most spectacular rise from the dead, 
leaving the shocked Braves wondering what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	After five innings of slumber, Mike Piazza's sacrifice fly and  
Darryl Hamilton's two-run single pulled New York to 5-3 in the 
sixth 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after Jose Hernandez's two-run single off Dennis Cook in  
the bottom half made it 7-3, the Mets pulled even against John 
Smoltz on Rickey Henderson's RBI double, John Olerud's run-scoring 
single and Piazza's two-run homer, just his fourth hit in 23 
at-bats in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Benny Agbayani singled and scored go-ahead runs in the eighth  
and 10th. Pratt hit a go-ahead sacrifice fly. Mora singled in both 
innings and threw out Ryan Klesko at third base in the 10th, 
extending the Mets' life one more inning. 
</P>
<P>
	But it wasn't enough. Gerald Williams doubled leading off the  
11th, advanced on Bret Boone's sacrifice and, after two intentional 
walks, Rogers walked home the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets walked off the field for the last time -- slowly,  
hanging their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gone a lot of miles,'' Piazza said. ``There's a lot of  
guys that matured in here. There's a lot of guys that have learned 
so much, not only about themselves, but what it takes to get to a 
World Series, not only the tangibles on the field, but the things 
that you don't see in a boxscore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one could kill the Mets this year. In the end, they killed  
themselves.

<HEADLINE> GOP May Take Over Va. Legislature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Ever the minority party in Virginia, the  
Republicans sense they are on the verge of an important first on 
Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
	All they need is to maintain their advantage in the state Senate  
and gain two seats in the 100-member House of Delegates to seize 
outright control of the General Assembly from the Democrats for the 
first time in history. 
</P>
<P>
	A significant strategic advantage is at stake: The party that  
dominates this election will decide how the state's legislative and 
congressional districts are drawn after the 2000 census. The 
redistricting could solidify the party's base for a generation or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire future of Virginia will be decided in these  
elections,'' Republican Gov. Jim Gilmore said Tuesday. He said a 
GOP majority is crucial to advancing his agenda of lower taxes, 
more accountability in education and tougher law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats caution against giving Gilmore a Republican  
legislature. State Delegate Kenneth Plum, chairman of the state 
Democratic Party, said voters should consider: ``Will we have an 
independent legislature, or will it be a rubber stamp for the 
governor?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP already controls the state Senate with 21 of the 40  
seats and holds the state's three top elected offices -- governor, 
lieutenant governor and attorney general. The House has 50 
Democrats, 49 Republicans and one independent who usually votes 
with the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	In next month's election, all 140 seats Senate and House seats  
will be contested. Elections for the three statewide offices will 
not be held this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In this year's campaign, Democrats raised $12.4 million to the  
Republicans' $14.2 million by the end of August, the last date for 
which complete figures are available. Democrats hope to gain some 
ground when President Clinton attends a fund-raiser in Alexandria 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing is certain: The candidates' spending will easily top  
the Virginia record of $20.5 million set in 1995, the last time all 
140 seats were up for election. 
</P>
<P>
	For most of the past century, Democrats dominated state  
government. Republicans were part of a coalition that controlled 
the assembly during Reconstruction, but they have never held an 
outright majority. And they had never held all three top statewide 
offices until Gilmore led the GOP sweep in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican fortunes began changing in 1969, when the GOP had a  
net gain of one Senate seat and 10 House seats. The party was still 
a tiny minority, with only 31 of the 140 seats, but the trend 
continued. By the start of this decade, the Democratic lead had 
been whittled to 30-10 in the Senate and 59-39, with two 
independents, in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Virginia always has been, is now, and probably always will be  
a relatively conservative state,'' said University of Virginia 
political analyst Larry Sabato. ``The conservative party is the 
Republican Party. It really is that simple.''

<HEADLINE> Northwest, America West Earnings Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Northwest Airlines reported its third-quarter earnings were hurt  
by higher fuel prices while Southwest Airlines said its profits 
dropped because of rising fuel costs and due to flight 
cancellations from Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, America West, which also reported earnings on  
Tuesday, said its profits rose 1.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Here is a look at the companies' results:  
</P>
<P>
	 *
</P>
<P>
                      *Northwest Airlines Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	Northwest reported profits of $180 million, or $1.96 per share,  
compared with a $224 million, or $2.91 per share, strike-related 
loss last year, but said high fuel prices and excess capacity 
throughout the industry cut into earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	A 15-day pilots' strike and related labor problems forced  
Northwest to cancel flights in the 1998 quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest quarter's results fell 2 cents short of the  
expectations of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 47 percent to $2.84 billion, from $1.93 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Operating income came to $370 million for the quarter, and  
compared with an operating loss of $275 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	President and chief executive John Dasburg said high fuel prices  
continue to affect earnings throughout the industry, which has also 
been hurt by overcapacity, which means available space on airplanes 
is greater than demand. Eagan, Minn.-based Northwest filled 77.7 
percent of its seats in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	If those trends continue, Dasburg warned that Northwest's fourth  
quarter financial performance could also be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest shares rose 50 cents to $26.25 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, Northwest earned $271 million, or  
$2.95 a share, compared with a loss of $104 million, or $1.25 a 
share, in the first nine months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues increased to $7.72 billion from $6.83 billion.  

</P>
<P>
                       *Southwest Airlines Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	Southwest reported a 2.3 percent drop in net earnings to $127  
million, or 24 cents a share, from $130 million, or 24 cents a 
share, for the same quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported third-quarter revenues of $1.24 billion, up  
from 1.1 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas-based carrier said profit was hurt by higher jet fuel  
prices and flight cancellations caused by Hurricane Floyd, which 
hit the southeastern United States in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Southwest met the 24 cent-a-share expectations of  
analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Southwest's stock was unchanged at $16.75 a share on the New  
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported its fuel costs rose 48 percent above last  
year's prices, to nearly $143 million, while average jet fuel 
prices rose 32.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline chairman and CEO Herb Kelleher said bookings for the  
remainder of the year are good but the airline expects modest 
non-fuel cost increases in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the first nine months, Southwest reported a 14 percent  
increase in net income to $380.6 million, or 71 cents per share, 
from $333 million, or 63 cents per share in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also reported a 13 percent increase in revenues to  
$3.5 billion from $3.1 billion a year ago. 

</P>
<P>
                     *America West Holdings Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The parent company of America West Airlines announced  
third-quarter earnings of $22.2 million, or 57 cents per share, a 
1.5 percent increase over $21.9 million, or 49 cents per share, for 
the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The report exceeded Wall Street expectations of 51 cents per  
share, according to a survey of First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	America West reported revenues of $552.8 million, up 11 percent  
from last year's revenues of $499.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix-based America West Holdings Corp. owns the airline and  
The Leisure Co., a package travel business. 
</P>
<P>
	William Franke, chairman, president and chief executive of  
America West, said the earnings were particularly encouraging in 
light of high jet fuel prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuel expenses for the quarter increased 27.2 percent from $47.3  
million to $60.2 million. The company said it was able to offset 
part of the price increase through its hedging program, which saved 
the company $6.8 million in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors bid the value of America West's stock rose $1.37 1/2 to  
$19.81 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first nine months of the year, the company earned net  
income of $90.4 million, or $2.26 per share, up from $88.4 million, 
or $1.88 per share, for the first nine months of 1998. Revenue rose 
to $1.64 billion from $1.52 billion in the same period.

<HEADLINE> Philip Morris Earnings Up 2 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip Morris Cos. Inc.'s profit edged up 2  
percent in the third quarter before onetime charges, matching Wall 
Street expectations as increases in food and beer earnings offset a 
decline in tobacco profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of Marlboro cigarettes, Maxwell House coffee and  
Miller Lite beer reported Tuesday its earnings excluding one-time 
items rose to $2.1 billion, or 87 cents a share, from $2.05 
billion, or 84 cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 6.9 percent to $19.9 billion from $18.6 billion a  
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results matched the 87 cents per share that analysts  
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected. In afternoon 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Philip Morris shares were 
up 6 1/4 cents a share at $30.56 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest results exclude $136 million in pretax charges for a  
factory closing and reduction of cigarette capacity in Brazil and 
$8 million related to job cuts in the domestic tobacco business. 
the 1998 results exclude the impact of $121 million in pretax 
charges mainly for settling tobacco suits. 
</P>
<P>
	With those charges included, net income was up 1.1 percent to $2  
billion, or 84 cents a share, from $1.98 billion, or 81 cents a 
share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic tobacco profits were off 1.8 percent for the quarter,  
as Philip Morris shipped 10.6 percent fewer cigarettes. But its 
revenue from cigarette sales in the U.S. climbed 24.5 percent 
because it raised prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris and the other major U.S. tobacco makers raised  
prices sharply last year to help defray the costs of their $246 
billion, 25-year settlement with the states over the costs of 
treating sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments by the nation's biggest cigarette company fell faster  
than the 9.3 percent industrywide decline, and it estimated its 
share of the industry shipments fell 0.7 percentage point to 49.3 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But it said shipments a year ago were inflated because of  
promotional activities and said its share would have arisen if the 
figures were adjusted to factor out the impact of those activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments of Marlboros, the industry's biggest brand, fell 10.8  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Burry, tobacco analyst for Brown Bros. Harriman, said the  
company's profit per cigarette was rising in both the domestic and 
international tobacco businesses and that it should leave Philip 
Morris with ``massively more cash on the balance sheet than they 
need to make their settlement payments next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the above-average decline in tobacco shipments shows  
there ``seems to be some sputtering'' in its market share growth. 
``Its ability to gain market share is ebbing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	International tobacco profits were about the same as last year  
as it shipped 5.8 percent fewer cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits were up 7.1 percent on its Kraft Food North America  
business led by gains in its Capri Sun and Maxwell House beverages, 
Kraft cheese, Post cereals and Oscar Mayer meats. International 
food profits rose 1.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	At Miller Brewing, profits rose 18.6 percent due to higher  
pricing and the impact of its enlarged contract brewing business. 
Shipments rose for Miller Lite and Miller High Life but fell for 
Miller Genuine Draft and Molson, the Canadian brand that Miller 
distributes in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, Philip Morris earned $5.82 billion,  
or $2.41 a share, after charges compoared with $5.1 billion, or 
$2.09 a share, a year ago. Revenue rose to $59.2 billion from $55.9 
billion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Knee Injury Plagues Hornets' Davis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Charlotte Hornets reserve guard Ricky  
Davis, a first-round draft choice in 1998, could miss up to four 
months with torn cartilage in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury occurred in Charlotte's exhibition game at Minnesota  
on Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets said Tuesday that surgery was scheduled for  
Thursday, when the tear is to either be repaired or cut out, 
depending on the severity of the injury. The team said Davis is 
expected to be sidelined for 6-to-16 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Glenn Perry, the team's head physician, said if the  
cartilage can be repaired, Davis would be sidelined for the longer 
recovery period but would have less chance of long-term damage in 
the joint. Removing the cartilage would get Davis back on the floor 
quicker but would invite long-term wear and tear in the joint, 
Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all depends on what we find in there Thursday,'' Perry  
said. ``But he's only 20 years old, so he's young and strong and 
should bounce back fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-6 Davis was the 21st overall pick in last year's  
draft after playing just one season at Iowa. He appeared in 46 of 
the Hornets' 50 games last season, averaging 4.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was targeted for a reserve role again this season.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a devastating loss for us,'' coach Paul Silas said. ``I  
don't know exactly what we're going to do right now. I need to look 
at some other people.''

<HEADLINE> Springsteen Late for L.A. Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bruce Springsteen took the stage an hour late  
for the first public concert at the Staples Center, but few fans 
seemed to care. 
</P>
<P>
	Springsteen joked with the audience Sunday that when he first  
arrived he thought he was playing at an office supplies store. And 
he quipped: ``The water pressure in the shower backstage, for what 
they paid for it, is not what it should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The concert was the first event in the 20,000-seat arena, which  
was built in a year and a half by construction crews working 18 
hours a day, six days a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he was playing at the House of Pancakes, it wouldn't  
matter,'' said Debbie Steinberg of Los Angeles, who was wearing a 
Springsteen tour shirt. ``I think he's one of the best live 
performers of the century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I really wanted to come and see Springsteen tonight,'' Robyn  
Morningstar said. ``I'm going to see Ricky Martin here later, but 
I'm glad he's not the one opening it.''

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Jump 0.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inflation at the consumer level jumped 0.4  
percent in September, the biggest increase in five months, 
reflecting sharply higher prices for gasoline, cigarettes and 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said last month's increase in the Consumer  
Price Index, the government's most closely watched inflation gauge, 
followed a 0.3 percent rise in September. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, consumer prices have been rising at an annual  
rate of 2.8 percent, sharply higher than the tiny 1.6 percent 
increase in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The faster pace of inflation will mean a bigger cost of living  
increase for the 44.2 million Americans getting Social Security 
checks, who will see their benefits rise by 2.4 percent starting in 
January, nearly double the 1.3 percent increase they received this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But rising worries about inflation have set off alarm bells on  
Wall Street with investors concerned that the Federal Reserve will 
be forced to raise interest rates again at their next meeting on 
Nov. 16. The Fed has already boosted borrowing costs twice this 
year in an effort to keep the economy from overheating.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP Set To Meet on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House set a combative tone for  
budget talks with Republicans, telling GOP congressional leaders to 
``put aside their talking points and their attack ads'' when they 
meet with President Clinton this evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, meanwhile, said they would put Clinton on notice  
that they will not raise taxes or use Social Security surpluses to 
pay for extra spending the president wants. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton hoped to  
reach a ``framework'' for a wider budget agreement but ``has no 
particular mechanism in mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides are meeting nearly three weeks into the new fiscal  
year with only five of the 13 annual spending bills approved. Five 
others have either been vetoed or face veto threats over issues 
including hiring teachers and police officers and blocking tougher 
environmental requirements for some oil and mining companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president hopes to find a way to get to agreement where we  
can maintain our fiscal discipline and our priorities,'' Lockhart 
told reporters. ``I think he hopes Republicans can put aside their 
talking points and their attack ads, come down and be honest and 
straightforward and work through these problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But with neither party ready to go to the brink, the House voted  
421-2 today to approve an eight-day extension of the temporary 
measure that has kept federal agencies open since fiscal 2000 
started on Oct. 1. Only Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, voted no. 
</P>
<P>
	The first stopgap bill expires Thursday night. Senate passage of  
the extension until Oct. 29 was also possible today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to reach out a hand of friendship and hope that  
we can work together,'' Clinton said Monday night in Newark, N.J., 
where he attended a Democratic fund-raising event. 
</P>
<P>
	That hand is being extended as relations between the White House  
and Congress, already soured by Clinton's impeachment trial, have 
worsened. Last week's Senate rejection of the nuclear test ban 
treaty, a top administration foreign policy goal, has sparked 
bitter accusations of partisanship from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand about public discourse in this town. Sometimes it  
gets colorful,'' acknowledged Armey, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget  
office, the White House says even without meeting all of Clinton's 
budget demands, GOP spending plans would spend billions in Social 
Security surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's budget wouldn't spend the Social Security  
surplus,'' said White House budget director Jack Lew. ``Congress 
has said they want to do the same thing. We don't believe they 
have. We need to work out our differences in a fiscally responsible 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed paying for additional spending by raising  
tobacco taxes, levies charged industry to cover toxic waste 
cleanups and other revenues -- proposals Republicans have turned 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their differences, the two sides' differences pale  
compared with the clashes of 1995 and 1996, when GOP efforts to 
abolish entire agencies like the Education Department helped prompt 
two federal shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the five bills in the center of this year's spending fight,  
Clinton wants less than $10 billion over what Republicans have 
offered, a tiny portion of the nearly $600 billion that the annual 
spending bills control. 
</P>
<P>
	And in recent weeks, Republicans have added billions of dollars  
to move closer to Clinton's proposals. Those bills cover the 
departments of Interior, Commerce, Justice, State, Labor, 
Education, Health and Human Services, and foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	But the two sides have philosophical differences, such as how  
extensive state control over federal education aid should be. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Clinton vetoed a $12.7 billion foreign aid bill that  
fell $2 billion below his request. It omitted any of the $500 
million he wants for Israel and the Palestinians to implement the 
accord they struck last year at Wye River, Md. It also provided 
less than he wanted for international debt relief and efforts to 
reduce the nuclear threat from Russia, North Korea and other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Though both sides stood to gain by holding a meeting that would  
let them appear reasonable, it was unclear what the session would 
achieve. There were some hopes on both sides that it would lead to 
a series of lower-level meetings where remaining differences could 
be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, House and Senate Republicans agreed Monday to a  
compromise $37 billion measure financing the Commerce, Justice and 
State departments. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans added about $1.5 billion to it, but Democrats said  
Clinton would probably veto it anyway. It still contains about $2 
billion less than he wants, including less than half his $1.3 
billion request for hiring local police officers.

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Encyclopaedia Britannica, afraid of becoming  
just a dusty relic of the pre-computer age, is making its 32-volume 
set available for free on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	From a-ak (an ancient East Asian music) to Zywiec (a town in

	The 231-year-old company dumped door-to-door sales three years

The move may have been inevitable in an era when students doing 
homework are more likely to get their information from a computer 
than from a book. 
</P>
<P>
	The privately held company won't reveal revenue figures, but  
sales of its print volumes -- which cost $1,250 a set and are now 
sold mostly to schools and other institutions -- have seen a steep 
decline, admitted Don Yannias, chief executive of Britannica.com. 
</P>
<P>
	In an Internet-dominated market, ``you have to be free to be  
relevant,'' said Jorge Cauz, senior president of Britannica.com 
Inc., the new company that holds the Chicago encyclopedia 
publisher's digital properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Free encyclopedias are only part of the lure. The Web site also  
will offer current information from newspapers, news agencies and 
70 magazines as well as e-mail, weather forecasts and financial 
market reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts who follow Britannica say its belated but aggressive  
moves into the electronic world, including some significant success 
with CD-ROM sales over the past three years, just may work. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're clearly not going to be able to recoup their revenues  
in the short term,'' said Aram Sinnreich of Jupiter Communications 
Inc. in New York. ``But the move just might save them in the long 
run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The early response was promising. Britannica said the site  
received millions of hits Tuesday, temporarily blocking access for 
some. The company said it expected to clear up the problems by the 
end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	For generations, Britannica set the standard for encyclopedias.  
The leather-bound books were sold door-to-door, via direct mail, or 
at shopping mall kiosks. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak in 1989, Britannica had estimated revenue of $650  
million and a worldwide sales force of 7,500. But with direct sales 
abandoned, the staff shrank as low as 280 and is now about 400. 
</P>
<P>
	The company lost ground badly after it spurned Microsoft, which  
went on to team up with discount encyclopedia publisher Funk &AMP; 
Wagnalls to produce a colorful, multimedia encyclopedia on CD-ROM 
in 1993. Britannica's own CD-ROM version, released a year later, 
was low on graphics and did not fare as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Britannica became the first encyclopedia available on the Web in  
1994, but there was an $85-a-year subscription fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Swiss investor Jacob Safra bought Britannica in 1996, the  
company has been making a bigger push for the electronic market. 
The online subscription fees were dropped and CD-ROM sales began to 
account for the bulk of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before we were more backward-looking -- looking back at  
historical events,'' Yannias said. ``Now we can be right on the 
brink of current events, incorporating the news with the 
foundations of history.''

<HEADLINE> Eagles' Douglas Needs Bicep Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Eagles defensive end Hugh  
Douglas needs surgery on his torn biceps and could be out for the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas, who led the team with 12 1/2 sacks last season, will have  
surgery Wednesday, agent Drew Rosenhaus said. The Eagles said 
Tuesday night that a doctor's second opinion confirmed Douglas 
would need an operation, and that details of the surgery will be 
released on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles have not removed Douglas from the 53-man roster.  
</P>
<P>
	Coach Andy Reid said Monday that Douglas would be out for the  
year if he needed surgery. Reid was not available Tuesday, the 
team's day off. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a strong chance he's going to need surgery on that,''  
Reid said at his weekly press briefing. ``If he does, he'll be out 
for the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas ruptured his left biceps as he fought off a blocker  
while chasing Bears running back Curtis Enis in the Eagles' 20-16 
victory over Chicago on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenhaus held out hope that Douglas could return this season,  
but the Eagles (2-4) would have to keep him on the active roster. 
New England linebacker Ted Johnson had the same injury in the 
preseason and was not placed on injured reserve. The Patriots said 
he'd be out four months. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that was up to Hugh, I'm certain he would want to come back  
and contribute,'' Rosenhaus said. ``We do know he's a fast 
healer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas just came back from a partially torn knee ligament in  
two weeks after doctors expected him to miss six weeks. Losing him 
again is a huge blow to the Eagles' defense, which leads the NFL 
with 17 forced turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very frustrating, because I only got to play about two  
games and then this happens,'' said Douglas, who does not want to 
play at less than full strength. ``I'm not the biggest defensive 
lineman to begin with. To play at half my strength, that wouldn't 
be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles are prepared to go with a rotation including Mike  
Mamula, Brandon Whiting and Ike Reese to replace Douglas.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Boy To Be Tried for Incest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- An 11-year-old boy accused of fondling his  
5-year-old sister is at the center of an international debate over 
when childhood play crosses the line and becomes a criminal act. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy, who has dual Swiss-American citizenship and is known by  
his first name, Raoul, was placed in juvenile detention after his 
Aug. 30 arrest at his family's home in Evergreen. 
</P>
<P>
	A neighbor had reported seeing him fondling his sister.  
According to court documents, the girl also told case workers of 
other incidents in which the boy molested her. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors charged the boy in juvenile court with incest, and a  
judge ruled Tuesday that the case can proceed, although she 
released him into foster care. If convicted, Raoul could be forced 
to spend two years in a juvenile institution or placed under home 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold Wegher, one of the boy's lawyers, said he will plead  
innocent at his arraignment Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the neighbor, Wegher said: ``I think that she was attributing  
to what she saw sexual connotations that did not exist or were not 
intended by the child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case has prompted angry headlines in Switzerland, where the  
mass-circulation newspaper Blick has campaigned for his immediate 
release and gathered nearly 9,000 petition signatures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ten years ago, a harmless play of `doctor' was considered  
quite normal. But today, the prosecutors label it a crime of 
violence,'' Blick said Monday in an editorial. ``Ten- and 
11-year-old children are imprisoned because prudish and unrealistic 
lawyers want it that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Tuesday's hearing at the Jefferson County court, the slight,  
blond boy sat down beside his attorney, scribbling on a piece of 
paper. Several reporters from Switzerland were in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, about a dozen Swiss-Americans gathered to protest.  
</P>
<P>
	``In Switzerland if something like this were to happen, someone  
would talk to the parents and would say `let's sit down and discuss 
this,''' Hanspeter Spuhler said. ``But to make a federal case out 
of it, this is just unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's great-aunt, Linda Campos, agreed, saying Raoul should  
be ``taken somewhere where he can be loved and taken care of and be 
with a family member,'' she said. ``What I feel is that he is the 
victim now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's mother and stepfather have fled to Switzerland with  
their three daughters -- aged 12, 5 and 3 -- and have been quoted in 
Swiss media as saying they will get the boy back there, too, ``as 
quickly as possible'' if he is released. 
</P>
<P>
	Raoul's mother said the boy was taken from his bed when he was  
arrested, and held in handcuffs in the patrol car. He has appeared 
in court in handcuffs, shackled to other juvenile offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Local and U.S. officials say the boy is being treated  
appropriately and stress the court proceedings are designed not to 
punish him but to help him. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Davidson, the director of the American Bar Association's  
Center on Children and the Law, said people in Switzerland ``may 
regret the idea that an 11-year-old can be locked up, and some in 
the U.S. do, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But courts need to take cases of alleged juvenile sex  
offenders very seriously, because this is a time when we probably 
do the most good in terms of treatment intervention,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A neighbor, Laura Mehmert, told social service workers that she  
saw the boy touch his sister after he pulled her pants down while 
they were playing outdoors. When she approached the children, she 
said, Raoul said he was helping his sister remove something in her 
pants. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mehmert testified Tuesday that she had seen Raoul pull his  
sister's pants down and put his face in her crotch. Mehmert said 
she also saw him press his crotch against his sister's bare bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	An affidavit filed in court said the complaint was one of  
several against the boy in recent months. In June, the girl told a 
caseworker that her brother pulled down her pants and underwear and 
kissed her vagina, according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl also told caseworkers that the boy had touched her  
vagina while she was going to the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Raoul told a sheriff's deputy, who testified Tuesday, that his  
sister was lying and that he had simply been helping her go to the 
bathroom. Raoul told the deputy he had never kissed her vagina. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the boy's mother and stepfather, Vincent Todd, said  
the couple fled because they had been threatened by social service 
workers with losing custody of their children because of the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement they said, ``The rule of law is currently  
suspended in Colorado.''

<HEADLINE> Son of Rep. Bobby Rush Shot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The son of Rep. Bobby Rush was shot and  
critically wounded outside his South Side home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Huey Rich, 29, went through two operations Tuesday at Christ  
Hospital and Medical Center after he was shot in the groin and 
thigh, hospital spokeswoman Sue Reimbold said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rush, a Chicago Democrat and former Black Panther who  
unsuccessfully challenged Mayor Richard M. Daley this year, went to 
the hospital but did not make himself available to reporters. A 
former city alderman, Rush has served in Congress since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokesman Pat Camden said that on Monday night, two men  
pretending to be plainclothes police officers approached Rich and 
several friends, and Rich was shot twice. 
</P>
<P>
	The men fled in a car and were still being sought Tuesday,  
Camden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich's friends said he was raised by a grandmother and bears his  
mother's last name.

<HEADLINE> Blues' Courtnall Mulls Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis Blues forward Geoff Courtnall may be  
forced to retire after suffering his second concussion in less than 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The team announced Monday that Courtnall, who missed 4 1/2 months  
last season with a concussion, suffered a Grade 2 concussion 
Saturday during the Blues' 4-2 win over Toronto. The injury 
occurred when Maple Leafs defenseman Bryan Berard elbowed the 
37-year-old left wing on the chin. 
</P>
<P>
	Courtnall was evaluated Monday by Blues neurologist Dr. Ralph  
Dacey, who prescribed 10-15 days of bed rest. After that time, 
Dacey will reevaluate Courtnall. 
</P>
<P>
	Courtnall didn't comment Monday, but management and teammates  
expressed concern for his future outside of hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to think about the rest of his life and his family when  
he's making these decisions,'' Blues captain Chris Pronger said. 
``I'm sure he'll have a couple of long weeks to think over what 
he's going to have to do and be prepared to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although no one said Courtnall should retire, the players'  
comments seemed to point in that direction. Courtnall and his wife, 
Penni, have two children -- Adam, 12, and Justin, 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am worried about him,'' defenseman Marc Bergevin said. '' I  
can see his point, that it's hard to walk away, but this is not a 
leg or an arm. It's his head. He has 40 to 50 good years ahead of 
him. He doesn't want to wake up one morning and not be able to 
talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Postconcussion syndrome has ended the careers of a number of  
players in the past few seasons -- most recently, Jeff Beukeboom of 
the New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disturbing,'' Blues coach Joel Quenneville said. ``He  
feels a bit like he did last year, which is not good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Courtnall missed 58 games and suffered mainly from  
exercise-induced headaches and nausea, as well as dizziness and 
some vision problems. On Sunday, he woke up with a headache that 
trainer Ray Barile said lingered Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It took Courtnall several months to recover last season, but  
only one month this season to suffer a recurrence. Barile said the 
effects of concussions are cumulative. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't take as big a hit to get another one when you've  
had history of concussions,'' Barile said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Saturday's blow, Courtnall was dazed on a punch  
to the face by Dallas' Brad Lukowich in a brief scuffle during an 
exhibition game on Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like when he gets hit, he gets scrambled again,''  
forward Kelly Chase said. ``It doesn't matter whether it's a dirty 
hit or a clean hit, it's done. He's already hurt, and there's 
nothing you can do for him.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP Meeting on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top Republicans pledged Tuesday they would  
reject any budget deal that used Social Security surpluses as they 
headed for White House talks on their spending impasse with 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no winks and nods'' about using Social Security  
funds for extra spending, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, 
told reporters. ``There will be no backroom deals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eager to cast the administration in a cooperative light, White  
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said, ``It's our hope the Republicans 
will put the attack ads aside, the talking points aside, and come 
down and work with us in good faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The comments came before Clinton and congressional leaders held  
a late afternoon White House meeting on their budget dispute, which 
has so far prevented enactment of eight of the 13 annual spending 
bills for the 19-day-old fiscal year. Five of the bills have either 
been vetoed or face veto threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their differences over spending for hiring teachers,  
purchasing park lands and other issues, neither side was ready to 
let the dispute escalate into an attention-grabbing government 
shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
	With a stopgap bill keeping agencies open set to expire Thursday  
night, Congress sent Clinton a measure extending that deadline 
through Oct. 29 while lawmakers work through budget differences. 
The president was considered certain to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved the measure by 421-2, with only Reps. Ron  
Paul, R-Texas, and Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., voting no. The Senate 
approved it by voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Following that show of bipartisan cooperation, however, the  
House quickly reverted to partisan positioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans forced the House to vote on $19.2 billion in tax and  
fee increases for this year, including a cigarette tax boost, that 
Clinton sought to pay for his proposed extra spending. The GOP 
hoped to use its 419-0 rejection to demonstrate that the 
president's plan for paying for higher spending was politically 
unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget talks took place even as Republicans crafted spending  
bills that were moving closer and closer to Clinton's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the five most controversial bills, Clinton was demanding less  
than $10 billion more than what Republicans were proposing -- out of 
a total of about $145 billion in annual spending that lawmakers 
control. Those bills cover the departments of Health and Human 
Services, Labor, Education, Interior, State, Justice, Commerce and 
other agencies, plus foreign aid and the District of Columbia 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	In many instances, the GOP was matching or coming near some of  
his specific dollar demands. House-Senate Republicans said their 
emerging compromise on health, labor and education programs would 
provide $300 million more than Clinton himself proposed. They had 
already provided more than Clinton requested for veterans 
health-care, NASA and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, policy disputes remained. Rather than providing the  
$1.4 billion Clinton wants to continue helping communities hire 
elementary school teachers, Republicans would provide $1.2 billion 
-- but let states decide how to use it. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the question of paying for spending that has become the  
key political dispute between the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the 1995 and 1996 budget clashes that saw Republicans  
demanding to abolish entire agencies, Republicans are now saying 
they are willing to provide some new spending. But first, they say, 
Clinton must pay for it without touching Social Security or raising 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Democrats say GOP spending plans, if enacted, would  
already eat into Social Security's surpluses, citing analyses by 
the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Republicans say the 
final versions of the spending bills will leave Social Security 
money alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, some Democrats say a final budget deal that uses some  
of the pension program's surpluses would be a political victory for 
them because it would fracture the GOP by infuriating 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said that he, too, wants to avoid using Social  
Security funds for new spending, though he has also offered to 
spend some of the pension program's surpluses if Republicans would 
join him. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, using Social Security's surpluses to cover spending has  
been done by both parties for decades and has had no effect on the 
system's ability to pay benefits.

<HEADLINE> CAW Says GM Agreement Imminent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Bargainers for the Canadian Auto Workers and  
General Motors Corp. reached ``the framework for a tentative 
agreement,'' union president Buzz Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said negotiatiors were continuing to meet to address a  
handful of local issues and grievances, but the deal was close 
enough to being completed for the CAW to cancel its strike deadline 
of midnight Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	GM was so confident of an agreement that it issued a news  
release Tuesday evening saying a tentative deal had been reached. 
But GM spokesman Stew Low conceded that a few ``little things'' 
were still under negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The union withdrew its strike deadline, and Buzz doesn't say  
these things lightly,'' Low said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said during a news conference in Toronto on Tuesday  
that once the tentative three-year is formalized, the union would 
recommend that its 22,000 GM members ratify it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said he thinks union members will approve.  
</P>
<P>
	``The economic package, I believe, will stand up to the scrutiny  
of our membership and their families,'' Hargrove said. ``Other 
workers in the country can take courage from what our workers are 
doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement follows the pattern CAW negotiators reached  
earlier with Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG, Hargrove said. 
It includes a 3 percent pay raise in each of its three years, a 
$670 signing bonus, an $800 Christmas bonus, longer vacations and 
improved pension, cost-of-living, health care and retiree benefits, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM also agreed not to sell or close any of its Canadian plants  
during the life of the proposed contract, Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	``GM of Canada has enhanced its commitment to Canada and our  
employees with substantial new capital investment and jobs,'' the 
automaker said in its statement. 
</P>
<P>
	A key breakthrough in the talks came Monday, when GM agreed to  
keep open through September 2002 its Ste. Therese, Quebec, assembly 
plant that builds Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac Firebirds. Under 
the tentative agreement, Hargrove said, GM agreed to study the 
feasibility of producing a low-volume, high-end ``niche'' vehicle 
like DaimlerChrysler's Dodge Stealth at Ste. Therese after Camaro 
and Firebird production ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The tentative agreement also reflects GM's decision Monday to  
withdraw a proposal to contract out hundreds of Canadian jobs. 
Hargrove had said the CAW was ready to strike over GM's plans to 
shift between 700 and 1,300 jobs from its own factories to outside 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	GM agreed as part of the proposed contract to notify its  
non-union suppliers that it would not take its business elsewhere 
if their workers voted to unionize, Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	A strike would have halted production of several GM products and  
cut off the flow of engines, transmissions and other key components 
to many GM plants in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Camaro and Firebird, GM assembles the  
Chevrolet Lumina and Monte Carlo, the Buick Regal and some 
full-size pickups in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	During 1996 contract talks, the CAW struck GM's Oshawa, Ontario,  
assembly plant, idling some U.S. parts and assembly plants.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Italy Dominate America's Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- U.S. teams and Italy's Prada  
dominated the opening races of the America's Cup challenger series 
today despite Japanese protests. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese team Nippon successfully sought a penalty against  
the New York Yacht Club's Young America after the boats scraped 
together before the start of their morning contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have a nice little shark bite just above the  
waterline,'' Young America afterguard Jim Brady said after 
admitting his team was in the wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The yacht's logo is a marauding shark. The Americans went on to  
win the race. 
</P>
<P>
	In the afternoon matchup, Nippon again protested, this time  
against San Francisco's AmericaOne, which snapped a steering chain 
during an aggressive duel for start positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Nippon objected to AmericaOne being granted a 45-minute delay  
for repairs and a restart to the race without penalty. Chief umpire 
Brian Willis said later the move was unusual but legal, and Nippon 
withdrew the protest. 
</P>
<P>
	In light winds that slowed racing to a crawl in the morning  
session, AmericaOne and Prada, considered among the favorites for 
the Louis Vuitton Cup, each trounced their respective opponents, 
winning by more than 14 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Wind picked up for the afternoon races, and the big-spending  
syndicates were again the strongest competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second day of the competition to decide who will take on  
New Zealand for yachting's most prized trophy in February 2000, 
Auckland had a perfect sunny spring day. 
</P>
<P>
	In the morning races, the Spanish challenge defeated Le Defi  
Francais by 55 seconds; AmericaOne defeated the Swiss Fast 2000 by 
14 minutes, 1 second; Abracadabra 2000 defeated America's Cup 
veteran Dennis Conner's Stars and Stripes by 3 minutes, 50 seconds; 
Prada defeated Young Australia by 14 minutes 43 seconds; and Young 
America defeated Nippon by 1 minute, 32 seconds. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> San Francisco Clock Leveled by Van </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The historic clock on Columbus Avenue  
ticked away through two world wars, movements for civil rights and 
gay rights, the summer of love and even a two-block move. 
</P>
<P>
	But its time came when a delivery van backed up into the 1908  
landmark and leveled it Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	All that was left after the accident was rubble where the ornate  
four-faced street clock stood on the sidewalk outside R. Matteucci 
&AMP; Co. jewelry stores for the past 91 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been the demise of a lot of street clocks around the  
country,'' said Arlene Hale, standing in front of her family's 
store and surveying the debris. ``These big trucks hit them and 
because they are made of cast iron they shatter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She isn't giving up hope on the clock, which was made by the  
Seth Thomas Clock Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to investigate if maybe we can replace it or have  
something new done,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father, who bought the store and clock from their original  
owners, helped keep it working, even when he moved the store and 
the clock two blocks down the avenue. Now in his 80s, he is 
hospitalized and doesn't know about the damage, Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of his baby, so I'm going to try to keep it from  
him,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Crews Hope To Haul Off Shipwreck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- For the past eight months, the New Carissa  
has been the shipwreck that would not die. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with winter weather looming, salvage crews hope to finally  
haul the freighter's cracked and charred stern off the beach to 
join the broken bow in a burial at sea. 
</P>
<P>
	But like everything else in this star-crossed salvage operation,  
nothing is coming easily. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is day 245,'' Bill Milwee, a representative of the ship's  
Japanese owners, said Monday after another high tide passed without 
the wreck coming off the beach. ``We're getting very close to 
winter weather setting in. We're late in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milwee said a support shoe on the rudder may be digging into the  
sand, making the ship like a sled without any snow. ``She's moving 
two or three feet every 45 minutes,'' Milwee said, adding 
confidently: ``She will be moved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milwee said they may put more water into part of the engine room  
in hopes that it would raise up the shoe and make it easier to move 
the ship. He also said the Atlantic Salver, a tugboat standing by 
to tow the wreck to sea, may be hooked up in tandem with the 
Salvage Chief, which is pulling on the stern now, to try to move 
the stern. 
</P>
<P>
	The pull at high tide Monday night barely budged the rusty hulk.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty much glacial speed tonight,'' Milwee said ``She  
was rolling a little bit then she'd lurch.'' Salvers planned to try 
again Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The 541-foot freighter ran aground Feb. 4 when it dragged its  
anchor while waiting to enter Coos Bay to pick up a load of wood 
chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, there has been one problem after another.  
</P>
<P>
	A harbor pilot tried to pull it off the beach with its own  
engines, but was not successful. While waiting for a break in rough 
weather for a salvage tug to make its way down the coast, the ship 
bounced and twisted in the surf, breaking cracks in the hull and 
releasing thousands of gallons of fuel oil that fouled beaches and 
shorebirds. 
</P>
<P>
	With the ship's back broken and pressure growing to prevent  
further oil leakage, a joint command made up of Milwee, the Coast 
Guard and the state decided to take a desperate step. 
</P>
<P>
	A Navy demolition team placed explosive charges and Bangalore  
torpedoes throughout the ship to crack open the fuel tanks and set 
ablaze the thick gooey fuel oil. The first attempt fizzled, but a 
second try lit up the evening sky with a tower of flame as crowds 
of spectators watched from a nearby ridge. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire did not consume all the oil, and more was released as  
the ship, weakened by the constant pounding in the surf, broke in 
two. 
</P>
<P>
	After 20 more days, the joint command lit victory cigars and  
gave each other high fives as an ocean-going tug using a special 
cable pulled the bow section off the beach, but the celebration was 
short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
	In a severe storm, the cable parted, and the bow soon was back  
on the beach, this time 80 miles north to Waldport, where tourists 
could pull over to watch the action. 
</P>
<P>
	Hauled off the beach again, the bow was towed far out to sea and  
to be sunk off the Continental Shelf in 12,000 feet of water, but 
shelling from a Navy destroyer couldn't sink it, and a Navy sub had 
to be called in to sink it with a torpedo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the stern sat mired in the sand, and some people  
talked of leaving it as a tourist attraction. But Gov. John 
Kitzhaber demanded it be removed, and two new salvage outfits took 
over in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is to alternately dredge away the sand miring the  
stern, and pull on the stern until it reaches water deep enough to 
float. The trouble is, each time the Salvage Chief heaves, the 
stern flexes, opening new cracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of like watching grass grow,'' said salvage  
supervisor Arnold Witte. ``It takes some time, patience and a 
little bit of luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tug eased its pulling Monday and moved in closer to dredge a  
channel through the sand in anticipation of the evening high tide. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilli Clausen, owner of Clausen Oysters, wishes she had never  
heard of New Carissa. 
</P>
<P>
	Spilled oil shut down her operation for three weeks, putting 40  
people out of work. Since the oil dissipated, the oysters she has 
harvested have been stunted. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not round and fat the way they used to be,'' she  
said, pulling an oyster from the conveyor belt carrying the latest 
harvest from boats to a processing shed.

<HEADLINE> FSU's Warrick Could Play Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida State's Peter Warrick could  
play Saturday against Clemson in a deal that would send him to jail 
for a month early next year, the star receiver's lawyer said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick was considered the leading candidate for the Heisman  
Trophy when he was suspended Oct. 7 following his arrest on a 
felony grand theft charge. He has missed the top-ranked Seminoles' 
last two games. 
</P>
<P>
	That could change Wednesday if Circuit Court Judge John Crusoe  
accepts a plea agreement reached by Warrick lawyer John Kenny and 
the Leon County state attorney to reduce the charge to petty theft 
-- a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State athletic director Dave Hart Jr. wouldn't comment  
Tuesday, preferring to wait until Crusoe acts on the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick and former teammate Laveranues Coles were charged with  
buying more than $400 of designer clothes Sept. 29 for $21.40 from 
a store clerk, who is also charged. A security camera recorded the 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement would require Warrick spend 30 days in jail,  
donate to charity clothing he acquired in three trips to a 
Dillard's store, pay $295 in court costs, stay away from the 
department store and serve a year's probation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted the 30 days to offer a misdemeanor,'' Kenny said  
Tuesday. ``That's pretty standard when looking at felony cases. 
They worked very hard to look at Mr. Warrick not as a football 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick could have avoided jail time, but not if he wanted to  
have a shot at playing again this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked at the options of going to trial to prove it was a  
petty theft, but those are not viable options when Peter wants to 
make himself available to the university as quickly as possible,'' 
Kenny said. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick caught 36 passes for 508 yards and four touchdowns in  
Florida State's first five games. He also threw a touchdown pass, 
ran back a punt for another and ran from scrimmage for a TD. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State (7-0, 3-0 ACC) visits Clemson (3-3, 3-1) in the  
first father-son matchup in Division I-A history as Bobby Bowden 
coaches against his son, Tommy. Also, the elder Bowden is trying to 
become just the fifth major college coach to win 300 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick totaled 372 all-purpose yards and scored three  
touchdowns at Clemson two years ago in a 35-28 win. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether he is able to return for Bowden's bid for 300 depends on  
Crusoe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The judge still needs to accept it,'' Kenny said Tuesday. ``I  
anticipate he will. It's a fair resolution for the state attorney's 
office and the best resolution for Peter to give him the greatest 
possibility for the university reinstating him and allowing him to 
play football. Now it's in their corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State does not let its athletes compete if they have  
been charged with a felony. However, Bobby Bowden said Sunday his 
star player has already paid plenty for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how much you have to give up,'' Bowden said.  
``Given up the Heisman ... given up two games ... your future 
opportunities have been hampered. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did wrong,'' Bowden continued. ``There are a lot of ways to  
punish people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Attorney Willie Meggs did not want to comment on the  
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there has been no agreement yet in the cases against  
Coles and the store clerk. Coles was kicked off the team when 
arrested. He was on probation at the beginning of the season for 
other violations of team rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Meggs said Warrick's case did not receive special treatment by  
his office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We resolve probably about 40 percent of our cases within 30  
days of the arrest,'' he said. ``So this is right in the middle of 
the pack.''

<HEADLINE> Easing of Cuba Sanctions Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farm state lawmakers renewed efforts to ease  
the Cuban trade embargo, proposing Tuesday to pass legislation as a 
separate bill that was dropped from the $69 billion agriculture 
spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, which overwhelmingly passed the Senate but met with  
resistance from anti-Castro House members, would further lift trade 
sanctions by requiring congressional OK for the president to use 
food, medicine or medical equipment in a trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's chief sponsor, Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., said Senate  
leaders will allow a vote on the issue next week. 
</P>
<P>
	With world demand and commodity prices at historic lows,  
commodity groups are pressuring Congress to open world markets by 
reducing trade restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's estimated that sanctions cost the U.S. economy more than  
$20 billion each year,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb. ``If a 
nation can't purchase products from the United States, other 
nations are more than ready to fill the needs of those markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unilateral sanctions against countries considered terrorist  
nations -- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Cuba and North Korea -- shut 
U.S. farmers out of markets worth an estimated $7.2 billion in 
1997, said Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Food and medicine should not be used as a foreign policy  
weapon,'' Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts argued that the free-market farm reforms he authored in  
1996, which increasingly are under fire with farm country mired in 
depression, will not work unless the United States gains ground in 
opening markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders earlier stripped the sanctions language,  
along with new dairy-pricing rules, from a House-Senate conference 
committee on the spending for operations of the Agriculture 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators stopped work on the bill after GOP leaders refused  
to let them consider the Cuba provision. The leadership then coaxed 
a majority of the panel's members to endorse the bill individually. 
</P>
<P>
	For Republican Reps. Jo Ann Emerson of Missouri and George  
Nethercutt of Washington, who pushed the embargo language in the 
House, the maneuver still rankles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fair has a new meaning in my vocabulary,'' said Emerson, who  
predicts the House will pass the measure if it goes to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said, ``We got stiff-armed in the  
conference committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emerson said rice producers in her southeast Missouri district  
suffered from trade embargoes on Cuba in 1962, Iraq in 1989 and 
Iran in 1995 because those countries were top buyers of U.S. rice. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanctions ``only end up pinching us, hurting our producers and  
hurting our country,'' Emerson said. 
</P>
<P>
	If embargoes were lifted this year, the National Association of  
Wheat Growers projects, U.S. wheat growers could export $500 
million more of their crop.

<HEADLINE> 76ers Sign Stanley Roberts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Often-injured center Stanley Roberts signed  
a $725,000, one-year contract with the Philadelphia 76ers on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts worked out with the team Monday and passed two  
physicals. The 29-year-old is expected to provide help inside, 
where the Sixers are hindered by injuries to Matt Geiger, Theo 
Ratliff and Tyrone Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts, who played for Houston last season, canceled visits to  
Miami and Milwaukee, who also were looking for another big man. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sixers did not use their $1 million exception on Roberts, a  
7-footer who got the eight-year veteran's minimum. It is not all 
guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Billy King said Roberts would provide ``added  
veteran leadership to our young corps of big men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sixers also waived guard Rowan Barrett.  
</P>
<P>
	Roberts, who says he weighs 315 pounds, had the best year of his  
career with the Clippers in 1992-93 under the tutelage of current 
Sixers coach Larry Brown. He averaged a career-high 11.3 points and 
started 76 games. 
</P>
<P>
	But his lengthy list of ailments includes two ruptured Achilles'  
tendons, bone spurs in his ankles, back surgery and recent shoulder 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing for Larry was the high point of my career,'' Roberts  
said. ``I know what he expects from me. He knows what I can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said, ``I like the kid. I want him in our league. If this  
is a good situation for him, good. But that's up to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sixers tried to sign Roberts last year, but he chose the  
Rockets. The signing came a day after Ratliff was diagnosed with a 
stress fracture in his left leg that will keep him out at least 
three weeks. Geiger has a sore knee, and Hill has a fractured 
thumb.

<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Dr. John G. Clark, a Harvard University  
psychiatrist who raised awareness of the influence of religious 
sects, died Oct. 7. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1970s, Clark studied newly emerging or unknown groups  
like the Unification Church, the Church of Scientology and the 
International Society for Krishna Consciousness. He also counseled 
over 500 former members of the groups and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	The Church of Scientology objected to some of Clark's  
assertions, and took him to court. In 1988, Clark settled with the 
group for an undisclosed amount and agreed to never publicly talk 
about it again.

as an influential force in American church music, died Oct 7. He 
was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	For 42 years, de Tar was the organist and choirmaster at the  
Episcopal Church of the Ascension in New York's Greenwich Village, 
where he helped establish the church's reputation for varied 
programs of religious music from the Renaissance to the present. 
</P>
<P>
	He also taught several generations of organists at the Yale  
University Union Theological Seminary and the Juilliard School. He 
made a strong case for replacing bombastic 19th century hymns with 
more contemporary ones, as well as 16th-century works that had 
fallen out of use.

	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Singer-songwriter Hamilton H. ``Terry''  
Gilkyson III, who wrote an eclectic range of music spanning folk to 
calypso to Disney animation, died Friday. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilkyson's 1968 song, ``The Bare Necessities,'' for Disney's  
``Jungle Book,'' was nominated for an Academy Award. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1960s, he wrote a song a week for ``The Wonderful  
World of Disney'' television show and later wrote theme songs for 
Disney movies including ``The Swiss Family Robinson,'' 
``Thomasina'' and ``The Aristocats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gilkyson songs were recorded by Johnny Cash, Tony Bennett, The  
Kingston Trio, Mitch Miller, Spike Jones, Marlene Dietrich, Doris 
Day, Harry Connick Jr. and Louis Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	He also co-wrote with his group, Terry Gilkyson and the Easy  
Riders, such classics as ``Everybody Loves Saturday Night,'' 
``Marianne,'' ``The Sea is Green'' and ``Memories are Made of 
This,'' the hit recorded by Dean Martin. ``Greenfield,'' recorded 
by The Brothers Four, was a Top 10 hit in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Mont Clare, Pa., Gilkyson served in the Army Air Corps  
during World War II and broadcast for Armed Forces Radio as a folk 
singer. 
</P>
<P>
	After the war, Gilkyson moved to Los Angeles to pursue a  
songwriting career. His first hit was the 1950 ``Cry of the Wild

beehives and other outrageous coiffeurs were comic highlights in 
five of Baltimore director John Waters' most popular films, died 
Sunday of cervical cancer. She was 49. 
</P>
<P>

	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Jim Moran, known for outrageous publicity  
stunts in the 1940s and '50s to promote products, Hollywood films -- 
and himself -- died Monday, He was 91.

<P>
	Sell an icebox to an Eskimo? Moran traveled to Alaska and did  
just that, at the behest of a refrigerator company. 
</P>
<P>
	Change horses in midstream? Moran performed the feat during the  
1944 presidential election, in the Truckee River at Reno, Nev. To 
bring attention to a property for sale, Moran spent 10 days finding 
a needle in a haystack.

	``He was maybe the last of the great, flamboyant press agents,''  
said Bob Thomas, who has covered Hollywood for the past 55 years 
for The Associated Press. ``He loved publicity himself, as well as 
making it.''

<HEADLINE> Allen's $3.4M Gift Saves Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- Earlier this month, state timber  
regulators gave conservation groups three months to come up with 
another $3.4 million to help preserve a virgin tract of the Loomis 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to Paul Allen, they needed only two weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	The billionaire Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist said  
Tuesday that he will cover the extra cost of protecting the forest 
from chain saws with a gift from the Paul G. Allen Forest 
Protection Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Loomis supporters raised $13.1 million from 5,000 donors. They  
were stunned when they were told that wasn't enough as the state 
set the asking price at $16.5 million two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, Paul Allen has mastered the art of finding the  
exact right time to come in and save the day,'' said Fred Munson, 
campaign coordinator for the Loomis Forest Fund. ``What do you say 
to somebody who calls you up and says they're going to save your 
campaign and donate $3.4 million?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists said Allen's gift guarantees that a  
25,000-acre tract of the forest bordering Canada in north-central 
Washington will be protected from road-building or logging. They 
say the forest is home to rare and endangered species, including 
what is believed to be the healthiest population of lynx surviving 
south of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen's forest foundation had declined an earlier request to  
donate to the cause because supporters had nearly reached their 
goal, said foundation manager Pablo Schuguransky. 
</P>
<P>
	When the price went up $3.4 million, ``the family and the board  
felt strongly this was the right thing to do,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state said the earlier price of $13.1 million was  
preliminary, and warned Loomis Forest backers not to stop 
fund-raising.

	Budget Progress By Clinton, GOP  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An agreement was struck tonight between  
congressional leaders and President Clinton to not use Social 
Security surpluses to pay for federal spending. ``Now we just have 
to roll up our sleeves,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., following an 80-minute meeting at the White House. In 
recent weeks, Republicans have made leaving Social Security 
surpluses alone a major goal of their budget fight with Clinton. 
The president has agreed, though at one point he also proposed 
using the surpluses if Republicans would agree to do so.

speech in which he defended his 16 months in office. Indonesia's 
legislature was prepared to elect a new head of state later in the 
day. In a session that dragged from Tuesday into the early hours of 
Wednesday morning, the 700-member People's Consultative Assembly 
also voted to recognize East Timor's vote for independence, paving 
the way for the half-island territory to become the world's newest

Asian country, nonetheless. A State Department spokesman, James

build fresh momentum for the measure. ``We will persevere,'' vowed 
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., whose call to reduce the role of money

would return to Boston on Wednesday for further tests. ``It was a 
big blow to us, but at least it's not his anterior cruciate 
ligament and it's early in the season,'' Celtics coach Rick Pitino

<HEADLINE> Court To Review INS Authority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court will take another  
look at whether immigration authorities have to go to court before 
revoking an immigrant's citizenship for failure to disclose past 
crimes or arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 in  
June that the Immigration and Naturalization Service could act on 
its own to withdraw naturalized citizenship because of fraud. That 
ruling, if it stands, will overturn a judge's nationwide injunction 
last year that affected more than 4,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
	But the full court said Tuesday that a majority of its 21 active  
judges had voted to set the ruling aside and refer the case to an 
11-judge panel for a new hearing, at a date not yet scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Loss of citizenship does not deprive immigrants of legal  
residency status, but makes them vulnerable to deportation for 
certain crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the immigrants in the case face loss of citizenship for  
allegedly failing to disclose past arrests in their applications. 
Their lawyer, Jonathan S. Franklin, said the INS has contended that 
virtually any arrest must be disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Jump 0.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inflation at the consumer level jumped 0.4  
percent in September, the biggest increase in five months, 
reflecting sharply higher prices for gasoline, cigarettes and 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said last month's increase in the Consumer  
Price Index, the government's most closely watched inflation gauge, 
followed a 0.3 percent rise in August. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, consumer prices have been rising at an annual  
rate of 2.8 percent, sharply higher than the tiny 1.6 percent 
increase in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The faster pace of inflation will mean a bigger cost of living  
increase for the 44.2 million Americans getting Social Security 
checks, who will see their benefits rise by 2.4 percent starting in 
January, nearly double the 1.3 percent increase they received this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But rising worries about inflation have set off alarm bells on  
Wall Street with investors concerned that the Federal Reserve will 
be forced to raise interest rates again at their next meeting on 
Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report today, the Commerce Department said that  
construction on new homes and apartments fell by 3.2 percent in 
September, the second monthly decline, as the impact of rising 
mortgage rates and Hurricane Floyd dampened activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline, which was bigger than had been expected, pushed  
housing construction down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
1.62 million units following a revised 0.5 percent drop in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd was blamed for part of last month's weakness  
with construction starts down 3.2 percent in the South and an even 
bigger 25.7 percent in the Northeast, the two regions affected by 
heavy rains and flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing construction was also off 3.5 percent in the West with  
only the Midwest enjoying an increase in activity last month, a 
gain of 8.2 percent. Mortgage rates have been rising in recent 
weeks with 30-year mortgages averaging 7.82 percent in September, 
more than a full percentage point higher than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	With the September inflation figures matching economists  
expectations, Wall Street chose to focus today on the 
weaker-than-expected housing report. Bond prices initially rallied 
a bit with investors hoping that the slowdown in this key area of 
the economy may convince the Fed that its two earlier rate 
increases are having the desired effect of slowing the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan contributed to investor  
unease last week by warning that banks and other lenders need to 
make sure they are prepared for the possibility of a ``bursting 
bubble'' of stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of last week, stock prices were down by the biggest  
amount in a decade, a slide that was hastened on Friday by the 
government's report that prices at the wholesale level shot up 1.1 
percent in September, the biggest gain in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	The 0.4 percent gain in prices charged consumers at the retail  
level was the biggest increase since a 0.7 percent spurt in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The acceleration in inflation this year has come from energy  
costs, which through September have been rising at an annual rate 
of 16.1 percent, compared to a decline of 8.8 percent for all of 
1998, a year in which the Asian currency crisis cut sharply into 
global demand for crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
	For September, energy prices jumped by 2.7 percent, the third  
straight month of sharp increases. Gasoline prices climbed 2.6 
percent last month while home heating oil shot up 6.2 percent, the 
biggest increase in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Food costs rose a modest 0.2 percent for the third straight  
month as a big drop in fruit prices helped to offset sharp 
increases in the cost of vegetables and beef. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the volatile food and energy sectors, prices were up 0.3  
percent, leaving the so-called core rate of inflation rising at a 
much more moderate 1.9 percent so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the Fed's rate increases point to the absence of  
inflation outside of energy to argue that the central bank does not 
need to be raising borrowing costs to slow down economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The core CPI increase of 0.3 percent would have been an even  
smaller 0.2 percent in September had it not been for a sharp spurt 
in tobacco costs, which were up 6.5 percent. That was the largest 
monthly rise since an 18.5 percent spurt in tobacco costs last 
December. Both big gains reflected the impact of huge court 
settlements in tobacco liability cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Clothing costs, which had fallen for four straight months, were  
also up September, rising by 1.2 percent, as retailers boosted 
prices for fall and winter clothing lines.

has insulted our son's character, and my character, and I resent 
it,'' Bush said. ``This kind of nasty, groundless attack is the 
reason that many good people are unwilling to enter politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am proud that George is willing and strong enough to take  
the heat even in the face of this kind of mindless garbage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book alleges that the younger Bush was arrested for cocaine  
possession in 1972 but that the matter was dropped after he 
performed community service arranged by his father. The book's 
allegations are based on anonymous sources. The book is at odds 
with other accounts of Bush's life and the Texas court system.

<HEADLINE> Ryan White Foundation To Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) --The Ryan White Foundation, which bears the  
name of one America's earliest and youngest public faces of AIDS, 
is closing because of dwindling donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeanne White-Ginder, White's mother, said she will close the  
organization and join forces with another advocacy group, AIDS 
Action, at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't be up to me to bring in all the money now,'' she said  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	White-Ginder will lead the Washington-based group's Ryan White  
Project, a new effort to bolster AIDS education among young people 
and to lobby for continued federal funding for AIDS programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are combining our efforts to make sure that Ryan's legacy  
continues,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	White, a hemophiliac, contracted the virus through tainted  
blood-clotting products. His court battle to be allowed to attend 
school drew widespread attention. Celebrities such as Michael 
Jackson and Elton John befriended him and he was the subject of a 
television movie. 
</P>
<P>
	He died in 1990 at age 18. Later that year, White-Ginder started  
the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	At its height, the Indianapolis-based organization had four paid  
employees and an annual budget of about $250,000. But dwindling 
donations forced the layoff of full-time staff this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Its leaders attributed the drop in funds to beliefs that the  
AIDS crisis is over. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, ``the AIDS epidemic is in the midst of one of its worst  
crises yet -- the crisis of complacency,'' said Mark Maddox, the 
foundation's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug advances have prolonged the life of many AIDS patients, but  
the rate of new AIDS infections has remained constant at about 
40,000 a year for the past decade. About half of new infections are 
believed to be among Americans under 25, according to the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention.

<HEADLINE>  Seau Never Rests on Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Say Ow. Say Wow. Then say this: Junior Seau and  
his buddies are having another sensational season. 
</P>
<P>
	The excitable San Diego Chargers linebacker and his teammates  
gained attention last year when they finished with the NFL's 
top-ranked defense. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was one problem. Their work was constantly undermined  
by all those blunders by inexperienced quarterbacks Ryan Leaf and 
Craig Whelihan. 
</P>
<P>
	The offense is still taking baby steps, even behind veterans Jim  
Harbaugh and Erik Kramer. While it improves, it's getting a free 
ride. That's how good San Diego's defense is. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprising Chargers are 4-1 and leading the AFC West  
following their 13-10 win over the Seattle Seahawks in which the 
defense again starred. Another big game is coming up Sunday, at 
home against the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers were knocked off the No. 1 perch by allowing the  
Colts' Peyton Manning to throw for a franchise-record 404 yards in 
their only loss. But they stuff the run like no other team, 
allowing just 2.57 yards a carry, and no 100-yard runner in 24 
games. They've forced 14 turnovers, leading to 55 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers are a force because of coordinator Joe Pascale's  
attacking, harassing, scheme; Pro Bowlers Seau and strong safety 
Rodney Harrison; and free agent acquisitions such as linebacker 
Eric Hill and cornerback Darryll Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	But it all starts with Seau, whose motor runs the same whether  
it's a Friday practice or a Sunday encounter with Ricky Watters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having a great time with a great group of guys, and I'm  
enjoying it more this year than ever before,'' said Seau, a 10-year 
veteran who's played in the last eight Pro Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Seau won't say it, but his teammates will: He might be playing  
as well as anyone in the NFL right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my opinion, he's playing the best football of any  
linebacker in the game, any defensive player period,'' said fellow 
linebacker Lew Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt,'' said backup safety Greg Jackson, a former teammate  
of Lawrence Taylor's with the New York Giants. ``I mean, he's 
incredible, the things that he sees on the field as far as the run 
defense. He makes everyone else around him better with the things 
that he does. 
</P>
<P>
	``Junior's not a real vocal guy in the huddle, but when we line  
up to play, he's another person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the second of Kramer's four interceptions in the second  
half Sunday, Seau squashed a Seahawks drive by throwing Watters for 
a 5-yard loss on a third-and-8 draw play. Plays like that limited 
Seattle to just seven points off those four turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer, who spent his previous 10 seasons with Detroit and  
Chicago, has only had to face Seau in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, there's very few guys you come across you have to  
account for where they are all the time,'' said Kramer, who's 
directed three straight wins in relief of the injured Harbaugh. 
``And every time you come to the line of scrimmage you figure out 
where this guy is and how he might hurt you. Junior's one of those 
guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Seau is the leader, the Chargers have spread the  
wealth. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Lewis, picked up after Tennessee released him at the  
final cutdown, has a team-high three interceptions. He scored on a 
blocked punt and on a fumble caused by a hard hit by Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
	In the season opener, linebacker Gerald Dixon scored on a fumble  
forced by you know who -- Seau. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a great defense because we play together, not because we  
have individuals who are running around crazy doing a great job,'' 
Seau said. ``If you broke us up separately, who knows what would 
happen. When we're together and we're playing as a unit, it's hard 
to beat us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Again, it all goes back to Seau, who had double-digits in  
tackles the last three games to lead the team with 42. He also has 
a team-high three sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Junior used to take a lot of risks, a lot of chances, and now  
they're calculated and they equal results,'' Bush said. ``I just 
think this organization has surrounded him with guys that are 
thinking the same way. His intensity is contagious. It carries the 
team, his energy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seau was Bobby Beathard's first draft pick after he took over as  
general manager in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the neat thing about Junior is his enthusiasm has  
never done anything but continue to go up,'' Beathard said. ``After 
this many years and that many years of being a Pro Bowler, some 
guys go into cruise control. Not with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's because of the defense that the Chargers, so awful the last  
two years, can dare think about getting back to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of being unemployed in January,'' Seau said. ``Those  
were probably the hardest months the past two years, in my life, 
just watching the game go on without me. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels as if everyone is going to recess and we're in  
detention. We've been in detention for two years. We want to get to 
the posteason.''

<HEADLINE> Gandhi To Keep Parliamentary Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Sonia Gandhi, who ran for two separate  
parliamentary seats and won both, today chose to keep the seat once 
held by her slain husband and will become the opposition leader in 
Parliament, a party spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi, who heads India's Congress Party, has chosen to  
represent Amethi in northern India, giving up the seat she won in 
Bellary in southern India, party spokesman Ajit Jogi told domestic 
news agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates in India can run for two different seats and keep the  
one of their choice if they win both. Mrs. Gandhi's decision ended 
speculation that she would give up the Amethi seat in Uttar Pradesh 
to enable her son or daughter to run for Parliament from the 
district once represented by her late husband, Prime Minister Rajiv 
Gandhi, and her brother-in-law, Sanjay Gandhi. 
</P>
<P>
	House speaker G.M.C. Balayogi accepted Mrs. Gandhi's resignation  
from Bellary and the decision will be announced when Parliament 
opens, according to news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi, 52, sought public office for the first time during  
the monthlong elections that ended Oct. 3. Her party made its 
poorest showing ever, retaining 112 seats in the 545-member house. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi did not say who would run from Bellary in an  
upcoming election. The Congress party has never lost an election in 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
	Amethi is a town 350 miles southeast of New Delhi. Mrs. Gandhi's  
late husband and his younger brother, Sanjay, both were elected to 
represent Amethi in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanjay Gandhi was killed in an airplane crash just a few months  
after he was elected in 1980. His mother, then-Prime Minister 
Indira Gandhi, persuaded Rajiv to enter politics and take his 
brother's seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Rajiv, who served five years as prime minister, was assassinated  
in 1991.

<HEADLINE> CAW Await Tentative Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Canadian Auto Workers withdrew its 11:59 p.m.  
Tuesday deadline to strike General Motors Corp. after bargainers 
reached ``the framework for a tentative agreement,'' union 
president Buzz Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was expected to be formalized Tuesday night, after  
which the union will recommend that its 22,000 GM members ratify 
the three-year contract, Hargrove said during a news conference in 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	GM issued a brief statement saying the automaker and union had  
reached a tentative agreement. Hargrove said, however, that 
bargainers were continuing to meet Tuesday evening to address a 
handful of local issues and grievances. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left with GM spokesman Stew Low and CAW spokeswoman  
Jane Armstrong were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economic package, I believe, will stand up to the scrutiny  
of our membership and their families,'' Hargrove said. ``Other 
workers in the country can take courage from what our workers are 
doing.' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement follows the pattern CAW negotiators reached  
earlier with Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG, Hargrove said. 
It includes a 3 percent pay raise in each of its three years, a 
$670 signing bonus, an $800 Christmas bonus, longer vacations and 
improved pension, cost-of-living, health care and retiree benefits, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM also agreed not to sell or close any of its Canadian plants  
during the life of the proposed contract, Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	A key breakthrough in the talks came Monday, when GM agreed to  
keep open through September 2002 its Ste. Therese, Quebec, assembly 
plant that builds Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac Firebirds. Under 
the tentative agreement, Hargrove said, GM agreed to study the 
feasibility of producing a low-volume, high-end ``niche'' vehicle 
like DaimlerChrysler's Dodge Stealth at Ste. Therese after Camaro 
and Firebird production ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The tentative agreement also reflects GM's decision Monday to  
withdraw a proposal to contract out hundreds of Canadian jobs. 
Hargrove had said the CAW was ready to strike over GM's plans to 
shift between 700 and 1,300 jobs from its own factories to outside 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	GM agreed as part of the proposed contract to notify its  
non-union suppliers that it would not take its business elsewhere 
if their workers voted to unionize, Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	A strike would have halted production of several GM products and  
cut off the flow of engines, transmissions and other key components 
to many GM plants in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Camaro and Firebird, GM assembles the  
Chevrolet Lumina and Monte Carlo, the Buick Regal and some 
full-size pickups in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	During 1996 contract talks, the CAW struck GM's Oshawa, Ontario,  
assembly plant, idling some U.S. parts and assembly plants.

<HEADLINE> UN Acquits Bosnian Serb of Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- The U.N. war crimes tribunal  
acquitted a Bosnian Serb on genocide charges today, ruling that his 
crimes against humanity did not constitute an organized campaign of 
atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the court formally convicted Goran Jelisic on 31 counts  
of war crimes to which he earlier confessed. Each count carries a 
maximum life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ending its first genocide trial, the tribunal said Jelisic -- who  
allegedly called himself ``Adolf'' in a reference to Hitler -- did 
not commit crimes consistent with the strict definition of 
genocide, the court's most serious offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``The accused could not be found guilty of genocide,'' Judge  
Claude Jorda of France said in reading out the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prosecution has not provided sufficient proof that Goran  
Jelisic planned, incited, ordered or instigated in any other 
manner'' a genocidal scheme against the Muslims of Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jorda said prosecutors had proven that Jelisic's actions  
constituted ``war crimes, crimes against humanity and grave 
breaches'' of international humanitarian law. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendant, wearing a striped pea-green sweater, stood  
silently between two guards while the judge pronounced the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Jelisic has confessed to the torture and murder of at least 12  
Croats and Muslims at the infamous Luka prison camp near Brcko in 
northern Bosnia in 1992. During his trial in The Hague, one witness 
testified that Jelisic often bragged about killing 20 to 30 Muslims 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
	A 53-year-old Muslim camp survivor identified only as ``Witness  
B,'' testified that Jelisic seemed to take pleasure in the killing 
and torture. ``He said it was nice to kill,'' the witness said 
during Jelisic's trial, which began a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Another witness testified that Jelisic and others ``simply knew  
we were Muslims and Croats. They simply wanted to eradicate us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jelisic, a former mechanic who worked at the camp, repeatedly  
denied that his crimes constituted genocide. He still faces the 
maximum punishment of life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
	A sentencing date was not set.  
</P>
<P>
	Mirsad Tokaca, head of a Muslim commission that investigated war  
crimes in Bosnia, expressed anger and shock at the acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any explanation for this after all the witnesses  
and their testifying. It makes me speechless,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To convict Jelisic of genocide, judges had to be convinced that  
the killings were part of a campaign intended to wipe out an entire 
ethnic group in and around Brcko, where most of the detainees 
lived. Prosecutors had also sought to establish a trail of evidence 
linking Jelisic to more senior Serb officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. court, set up by the Security Council in 1993, has  
convicted six other suspects of murder, rape, torture and other war 
crimes, but it has yet to register a genocide conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier genocide trial was halted when the defendant, Bosnian  
Serb Milan Kovacevic, died of a ruptured artery while in custody.

<HEADLINE> Niners Looking Rather Ordinary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- One of the NFL's most dominant teams  
for 19 years, the San Francisco 49ers are sliding into mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a number of things, too many to list, where we've got  
to improve,'' coach Steve Mariucci said Monday, an admission that 
was as blunt as it was startling for a team known for its lofty 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Their winning mystique has taken a beating this season, and  
judging from their record (3-3), they are no better than average. 
</P>
<P>
	And with Steve Young's future uncertain because of his  
concussion problems, injuries to other key personnel, a crumbling 
defense and the constraints of the salary cap, there is no prospect 
of a quick fix for the 49ers, who are among 17 NFL clubs with at 
least three losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're like a lot of other teams right now that are just trying  
to find their way,'' Mariucci said Monday. ``I think the upside is 
we have a chance to become more healthy, and get some of our 
players back toward the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what we're hoping for. We know where we are right now.  
We know our record isn't what we'd like. We're not as healthy as 
we'd like, but provided we just keep playing, hopefully we'll have 
a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco next plays at Minnesota (2-4) on Sunday, hoping to  
avoid its first three-game losing streak since 1980, the year 
before the 49ers won the first of their five Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday, the 49ers lost 31-29 to Carolina and were defeated 42-20  
the week before by St. Louis. The loss to Carolina ended a 
team-record 19-game home winning streak and marked the first 
back-to-back losses in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The downturn has left the team's veterans dazed and grasping for  
answers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to find a way to stop the skid,'' safety Tim McDonald  
said. ``If I knew the reasons, I'd make some suggestions or I'd 
tell you. We just have to find a way to get back on that horse and 
climb the mountain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the tide may be turning in a league that stresses parity and  
conspires against dominant teams through scheduling, the draft and 
the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of gradual erosion, the toll on the 49ers' seems to  
be accelerating from age, injuries, and cap constraints. San 
Francisco has had to dump some key veterans due to money 
limitations, and then was hit by injuries to such front-line 
players as Young, Garrison Hearst, center Chris Dalman and Terrell 
Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Garcia, who replaced Young, has gone 1-2 in his absence,  
looking good one game and bad the next. 
</P>
<P>
	And the 49ers, who have strung together 16 straight 10-win  
seasons while claiming an NFL best 10 division titles in the past 
13 years, suddenly are trying to fight the notion they're a team in 
transition in need, at long last, of extensive rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't necessarily need to crash and burn,'' Mariucci said.  
``You can keep it a certain level, win some close games, have a 
winning record and put yourselves in the playoffs. That's very 
possible and that's obviously what we're shooting for. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel we can do it. We certainly need to minimize our bad  
luck, some way some how, but I think if this team keeps fighting, 
we'll make some good things happen and I do think our youth will 
get better as we go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Ray Brown said the 49ers have to look inward to turn the  
season around and keep the team's legacy of success going. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't look outside the locker room for any excuses or any  
solutions,'' Brown said. ``The guys from other eras aren't taking 
any snaps this week and they aren't taking any snaps next week. 
It's got to come from within this team, and I think we're capable. 
But we have to realize who we are and what type of team we are.''

<HEADLINE> In Search of Elusive Middle Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When President Clinton laid claim to ``the  
vital American center,'' he urged his Democrats and rival 
Republicans to look past their political divisions and deal 
together with the nation's needs. He's still trying, he says -- but 
with fighting words now, against what he called Republican 
extremism and a new isolationism. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton accuses congressional Republicans of ``reckless  
partisanship'' that puts both economic progress and national 
security at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	There's not much left of Clinton's appeal during his 1996  
re-election campaign for Republicans and Democrats to work together 
on behalf of the American center. He still says, however, that ``we 
have to put politics aside and seek common ground'' at this point 
on the past-due federal budget, snarled in disputes about 
Republican spending cuts and Clinton vetoes to enforce his 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the immediate problem; the stopgap spending measure  
expiring on Thursday will have to be renewed to avoid government 
shutdowns while the White House and the Republican Congress try to 
come to terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said those are momentary difficulties. They also are  
annual ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inaction is not an option,'' the president said Monday, after  
he vetoed a foreign aid appropriation because of GOP spending cuts, 
with the White House signaling there are more vetoes coming. The 
Republicans can't override them, so they will have to find -- or 
bargain -- a way around them to get the budget done. 
</P>
<P>
	But once it is, it will be no landmark, just another year's  
appropriations. The major proposals Clinton wanted approved aren't 
happening this year, and the GOP Congress will be even more 
resistant heading into the 2000 elections for the White House, the 
Senate, and fragile GOP control of the House, which they hold by 
the narrowest margin in 44 years. A five-seat gain would put the 
Democrats back in charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wanted action on the long-term financing of Social  
Security for the retirement boom years of the 21st century. He 
sought Medicare reform, and expansion of that program to cover 
prescription drugs. He demands more money than Republicans want to 
spend on education, child care and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	On other issues, notably trade initiatives, his problem is with  
Democrats wary of offending labor and liberal allies. ``In our 
party, we have not been able to resolve these conflicts,'' Clinton 
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	There were in-party conflicts on other issues, too, among them  
welfare reform and prior spending deals. Clinton has been less 
inclined to moves offensive to liberal Democrats in Congress since 
they rallied to his defense against impeachment in the Monica 
Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to work with Republicans, independents and  
Democrats to move this country forward,'' Clinton told the centrist 
Democratic Leadership Council on Oct. 14. ``That is the difference 
in the new Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	But among Republicans, he said, ``we are still confronting a  
level of extremism and partisanship which is truly chilling for the 
long-term interests of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said his re-election in 1996 showed that ``the vital  
American center is alive and well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Put aside the politics of division,'' he urged in his victory  
speech. ``Put country ahead of party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the new center would not be ``the lukewarm midpoint  
between overheated liberalism and chilly conservatism,'' but a way 
to put fresh ideas into the mainstream of politics. 
</P>
<P>
	But two presidential scholars have just published a book calling  
it ``Dead Center.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Historian James MacGregor Burns and co-author Georgia Sorenson  
write that Clinton, who had wanted to transform politics, wound up 
tinkering with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president wanted all of the appearance of leadership, but  
none of the antagonism,'' they write. 
</P>
<P>
	In their book, ``the essence of democracy is not only the  
consensus that binds us together but the political conflict over 
the definition of values that gives voters real choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The subtitle of the book, ``Clinton-Gore Leadership and the  
Perils of Moderation,'' points to the 2000 chapter, as the vice 
president, no less an advocate of the ``new and dynamic center,'' 
seeks to succeed the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, backing Gore, rambled through a litany of his own  
proposals when he was asked what he thinks Americans are looking 
for in the next president. 
</P>
<P>
	``And you know, I hope that they will want someone ... who will  
try as hard as I have tried and maybe be more successful, although 
I think they'll have to make some changes in Congress to do that, 
to create a genuine, constructive bipartisan atmosphere,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that only happens about once a year.  
</P>
<P>
	But not this year. And probably not next.

<HEADLINE> Nets Scramble To Produce Game Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For that shiny new car -- and let's throw in a  
few thousand dollars to make it interesting -- here's our final 
jackpot question: 
</P>
<P>
	Which game show will show up on prime-time network television  
within the next year? 
</P>
<P>
	a) a ``survival of the fittest'' competition with 16 people  
dumped on a tropical island in the South China Sea for weeks to see 
who can best adapt. The winner takes home $1 million -- if not a few 
exotic diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	b) a high-stakes trivia game where contestants team up to win  
prizes, only to turn against each other when the money gets really 
big -- potentially $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	c) a remake of ``Twenty-One,'' the high-stakes quiz notorious  
for puncturing a previous game show craze 31 years ago when it was 
revealed a player was fed correct answers. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news is you can't lose. Each answer is correct.  
</P>
<P>
	But with Hollywood producers in a mad rush to make game shows  
following this summer's success of ``Who Wants to Be a 
Millionaire,'' the real question is whether the craze will pay off 
for TV networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Millionaire'' will be back next month, again with Regis  
Philbin as host. It was a sensation during its late-summer run at 
ABC, captivating viewers hungry for excitement after months of 
reruns and newsmagazines. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are just so many situation comedies on the air,'' said  
Rick Ludwin, NBC senior vice president. ``I think the audience is 
sending us a signal that they are becoming a little bored with 
comedies that don't measure up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game shows are ideal for television executives: they're cheap to  
produce, can quickly fill any hole in the schedule and are new to 
many viewers, while still being a format with proven success in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	Small wonder, then, that the networks have heard dozens of  
pitches for game shows in the past two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Television is the ultimate derivative medium,'' said Nancy  
Tellem, CBS entertainment president. ``If something's working, 
you're going to have 10 like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's partly why Fox is pushing ``Greed'' on the air so quickly  
-- perhaps as soon as two weeks. Its executives worry that viewers 
will lose interest when they are inundated with game shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greed'' has the $2 million payout in a test of human nature,  
1990s style: will you fatten your own wallet at the expense of 
friends? 
</P>
<P>
	NBC is bringing back the disgraced ``Twenty-One,'' canceled in  
1958 for the scandal depicted in the movie, ``Quiz Show.'' CBS has 
an option on that show's old competitor, ``The $64,000 Question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC is also combing the archives and considering other old  
favorites, like ``Concentration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's flattering to be copied,'' said Andrea Wong, ABC's vice  
president for alternative series and specials. 
</P>
<P>
	Happy to be first, ABC is cautious about other game shows. In  
development is ``Have I Got News For You'' with Norm McDonald, 
although Wong said it's more a comedy than a game. 
</P>
<P>
	In an era of extreme sports, many of the proposals being pitched  
are extreme: variations on the idea of the lengths people will go 
to humiliate or even hurt themselves for money, executives say. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's ``Survivor'' has an element of danger, with people  
marooned on an island. A losing contestant on a Swedish show based 
on the same idea committed suicide after returning home two years 
ago. Although the show said it wasn't responsible, the player's 
widow blamed it for the death. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one other American network passed on the idea, worried  
about the potential for bad publicity if something went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Tellem concedes ``Survivor'' is riskier than putting someone on  
stage to answer questions. But she said CBS is taking particular 
care in how it selects participants and in hiring a producer 
experienced in environmental challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	Networks face the danger of repeating history if they become  
embroiled in their own game of can-you-top-this, NBC's Ludwin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This sort of escalation is one of the things that killed game  
shows in the 1950s,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The legacy of ``Millionaire'' may also convince networks that  
there's a payoff in cheaply-produced, limited-run series that can 
be aired in the summer as an alternative to reruns. For instance, 
ABC is developing its own short series for next year on how a ``boy 
band'' gets its start in the music business. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interim, though, prepare to be quizzed -- at least until  
the inevitable backlash sets in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is room for two, maybe three of this form in  
prime-time,'' Ludwin said. ``You won't see 19.''

<HEADLINE> Blues' Courtnall Might Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A second concussion in less than a year might  
force St. Louis Blues forward Geoff Courtnall to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	The team announced Monday that Courtnall, who missed 4 1/2 months  
last season with a concussion, suffered a Grade 2 concussion 
Saturday during the Blues' 4-2 win over Toronto. The injury 
occurred when Maple Leafs defenseman Bryan Berard elbowed the 
37-year-old left wing on the chin. 
</P>
<P>
	Courtnall was evaluated Monday by Blues neurologist Dr. Ralph  
Dacey, who prescribed 10-15 days of bed rest. After that time, 
Dacey will reevaluate Courtnall. 
</P>
<P>
	Courtnall didn't comment Monday, but management and teammates  
expressed concern for his future outside of hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to think about the rest of his life and his family when  
he's making these decisions,'' Blues captain Chris Pronger said. 
``I'm sure he'll have a couple of long weeks to think over what 
he's going to have to do and be prepared to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although no one said Courtnall should retire, the players'  
comments seemed to point in that direction. Courtnall and his wife, 
Penni, have two children -- Adam, 12, and Justin, 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am worried about him,'' defenseman Marc Bergevin said. '' I  
can see his point, that it's hard to walk away, but this is not a 
leg or an arm. It's his head. He has 40 to 50 good years ahead of 
him. He doesn't want to wake up one morning and not be able to 
talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Postconcussion syndrome has ended the careers of a number of  
players in the past few seasons -- most recently, Jeff Beukeboom of 
the New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disturbing,'' Blues coach Joel Quenneville said. ``He  
feels a bit like he did last year, which is not good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Courtnall missed 58 games and suffered mainly from  
exercise-induced headaches and nausea, as well as dizziness and 
some vision problems. On Sunday, he woke up with a headache that 
trainer Ray Barile said lingered Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It took Courtnall several months to recover last season, but  
only one month this season to suffer a recurrence. Barile said the 
effects of concussions are cumulative. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't take as big a hit to get another one when you've  
had history of concussions,'' Barile said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Saturday's blow, Courtnall was dazed on a punch  
to the face by Dallas' Brad Lukowich in a brief scuffle during an 
exhibition game on Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like when he gets hit, he gets scrambled again,''  
forward Kelly Chase said. ``It doesn't matter whether it's a dirty 
hit or a clean hit, it's done. He's already hurt, and there's 
nothing you can do for him.''

<HEADLINE> Ellis Island Institute Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELLIS ISLAND, N.J. (AP) -- The National Park Service has plans to  
transform the long-neglected southern part of Ellis Island into an 
international conference center. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Ellis Island Institute would include a policy  
retreat with as many as 100 lodging rooms, a center for immigration 
and ethnic studies and a living history memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	A consultant's proposal for the center was made public Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Park service officials said a financial analysis would be  
completed within a few months, and they'll get the views of New 
Jersey state officials, Congress and the public before deciding 
whether to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal and state officials -- and groups with an interest in the  
island's heritage as a great immigration landing -- have sought a 
way to transform the island's dilapidated buildings into something 
useful. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea for a conference center is similar to one suggestion  
from an advisory committee appointed by Gov. Christie Whitman 
shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the land lies in 
New Jersey and not New York. The federal government actually owns 
Ellis Island, which was the first American soil walked upon by most 
immigrants between 1892 and 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler said academic, relief and  
health organizations would probably find Ellis Island to be a 
logical venue for their meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thought is, why not come to the place where the world has  
always come together?'' said Schundler.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign is  
making the task of surfing its Web site easier for one of its most 
frequent visitors -- the rival campaign of George W. Bush, the Texas 
governor and front-runner for the Republican presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's campaign posted a link Tuesday on its Web page for  
``Bush Campaign Staff,'' along with a list of the top 10 pages 
``they might want to visit while doing their research.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between Oct. 1 and Oct. 13, McCain's site at www.mccain2000.com  
was logged on to more than 1 million times, with the largest single 
visitor being the Bush campaign's Internet address, according to a 
statement posted on McCain's Web page. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 10 list includes links to pages providing McCain's  
position on issues, news releases and speeches, and his personal 
story, among other topics. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors who linger at McCain's site also are prompted to access  
a separate page to make contributions to the Arizona senator's 
campaign.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley  
called on President Clinton Tuesday to veto a spending bill for the 
Justice Department unless Republicans restore a hate-crimes 
provision for gays. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, House-Senate bargainers -- dominated by Congress'  
majority Republicans -- dropped from a compromise measure financing 
the departments of Commerce, Justice and State, a Senate provision 
that would have widened the definition of federal hate crimes to 
include incidents motivated by a victim's sexual orientation, 
gender or disability. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge President Clinton to demand that this hate-crimes  
language be restored as a prerequisite to signing this spending 
measure. The White House must take a leadership role in ensuring 
the passage of this language,'' Bradley said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Especially in this past year, which has been marred with hate  
crimes such as the deaths of James Byrd in Texas and Matthew 
Shepherd in Wyoming, the elimination of this language is an 
outrage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is likely to veto the measure anyway because of disputes  
over hiring police officers and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	In his campaign, Bradley has proposed expanding the 1964 Civil  
Rights Act's protections to gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gary Bauer expressed his support Tuesday for  
Republican presidential rival John McCain's effort to ban soft 
money contributions as part of campaign finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those unlimited special interest funds distort the legislative  
process and they have been egregiously abused during recent 
election cycles,'' Bauer wrote in a letter to McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain is cosponsor of campaign finance legislation being  
debated on the Senate floor. Supporters of the measure, which 
contains a ban on money that flows to political parties from 
unions, corporations and individuals in unlimited amounts, twice 
fell short of the 60 votes needed to break a Republican-led 
filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer told McCain that he supports the bill because he believes  
soft money ``pollutes the political process,'' but that he would 
favor a ``stronger worker paycheck provision'' governing the use of 
union dues for political or other purposes unrelated to the 
collective bargaining process.

<HEADLINE> Retirees Plan How To Spend 2000 COLA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Faye Miller knows she won't see the  
cost-of-living adjustment in her Social Security check until next 
year. But she already knows how she plans to use it. 
</P>
<P>
	The 73-year-old Tampa resident, struggling on a fixed income,  
will use the 2.4 percent increase to ease her costly prescription 
drug bill, which stands at $272 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every little bit helps,'' she said. ``If my children didn't  
help me out, I couldn't make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 increase will be nearly twice the size of this year's  
1.3 percent raise, mainly because of a recent upward creep in 
consumer prices. 
</P>
<P>
	It means the average monthly check for retirees will rise by  
$19, from $785 to $804. The increases will begin showing up in 
benefit payments for January. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the biggest increase in three years. In 1998, the raise was  
2.1 percent and in January 1987, it was 1.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Each month, Ms. Miller's Social Security check is $487. It is  
supplemented by a small alimony check. Ms. Miller lives at Baptist 
Manor, a 250-unit complex subsidized by the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development where rents range from $235 to $382. 
</P>
<P>
	Her medication is more than half her Social Security check. Ms.  
Miller takes medication monthly for Lupus, an autoimmune disorder, 
and protein C deficiency. The medication is an out-of-pocket 
expense; insurance doesn't cover it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't eat out. I don't go to movies unless my children take  
me. There are a lot of things I can't do,'' said Ms. Miller, a 
former gift shop manager. ``If I didn't have to pay for 
prescriptions, I could make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of low inflation, the yearly benefit boosts have been  
below 3.0 percent since 1994. The 1999 increase matched a record 
low of 1.3 percent set in 1987 -- not counting six months in 1983 
when the update was skipped to help Social Security out of a cash 
crunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, the 2000 increase is still one of the lowest jumps in the  
past 25 years. Double-digit inflation in the late 1970s drove the 
cost-of-living increase up to a record 14.3 percent in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	The adjustment has been automatic since 1975, requiring no vote  
by Congress. Calculations are based on changes in the Consumer 
Price Index -- the government's inflation yardstick -- from the third 
quarter of one year to the corresponding quarter of the next. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cost of living adjustment is a centrally important feature  
of Social Security that insures that beneficiaries, no matter how 
long they live, will retain their purchasing power as costs rise,'' 
said Social Security Commissioner Kenneth S. Apfel. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides retirement checks, Social Security benefits affected  
include those paid to disabled workers and families whose 
breadwinners have died. 
</P>
<P>
	The maximum monthly payment for 6.6 million low-income  
individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income, known as SSI, 
also will rise 2.4 percent. That will boost the maximum monthly SSI 
check by $12 to $512. For a couple, the SSI maximum goes up $18 to 
$769. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, monthly Medicare premium deducted from most elderly and  
disabled Americans' Social Security checks for insurance coverage 
of doctors' office visits will stay unchanged at $45.50 in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathy Grant, who retired from the banking industry in 1989, was  
elated to learn that she is among the 44.2 million Americans to get 
a raise. It means the 75-year-old Tampa woman can continue knee 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	She is slowed by lost vision in one eye from a fast  
deteriorating condition. Then in February she underwent knee 
replacement surgery. Ms. Grant said the extra money means she can 
continue the $26-a-month therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfreda Benge, who at 91 is spunky and in good health, will get  
an extra $19 to her $804. She said with the extra cash, she might 
eat out. 
</P>
<P>
	Benge figures it's was about time for a cost of living  
adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything else is going up, why shouldn't Social Security go  
up?'' she asked. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the interim, the retiree, who spent 40 years as a fashion  
buyer, has learned to adjust financially. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sold my car and I found out I could walk. I learned to ride  
a bus. I bought a cart and walked to the grocery store. And I 
manage beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is what you make of it,'' the widow added. ``Age is a  
state of mind. I have a son 70 who is older than me.''

<HEADLINE> Yankees, Braves Have Rematch of '96 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- At stake, the World Series crown and this title:  
Team of the Decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The defending champion New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves,  
already plenty familiar with each other, meet again in Game 1 
Saturday night at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a rematch of the 1996 Series, in which Derek Jeter, Andy  
Pettitte and the Yankees rallied to beat Greg Maddux, Chipper Jones 
and the Braves in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got another shot at them,'' Jones said Tuesday night  
after the Braves derailed any chance of a Subway Series, beating 
the New York Mets 10-9 in 11 innings to win the NL Championship 
Series 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll try to be team of the decade if that's what we're  
playing for,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said. ``It will be a lot of 
fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it includes this twist -- for the first time, the World  
Series features teams that played during the regular season. Right 
after the All-Star break, Tom Glavine, Brian Jordan and Atlanta won 
two of three interleague games at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that would take away anything,'' said Gene  
Michael, the Yankees' director of major league scouting. ``They're 
both great clubs, and this is what matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael was at Turner Field on Tuesday night, a day after the  
Yankees wrapped up their record 36th pennant with a 6-1 victory at 
Boston to take the ALCS in five games. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Joe Torre, once fired by the Braves, is taking New York  
on its third trip to the Series in four years. The Yankees will try 
to win their record 25th title and become the first club to win two 
in a row since Toronto in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees and Braves both posted the best record in their  
leagues this season, and they did it the same way -- strong 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
	ALCS MVP Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, David Cone, Roger  
Clemens and Pettitte lead New York's rotation, and closer Mariano 
Rivera has been dominant, especially during his postseason career. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine, John Smoltz, Maddux and Kevin Millwood lead the Braves,  
with excitable John Rocker in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	In three years of interleague play, the Braves and Yankees have  
split 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, Andruw Jones and Ryan Klesko each hit two homers  
and Jordan, who nearly signed with the Yankees in the offseason, 
drove in five runs against New York. Rivera and Hernandez were hit 
hard for New York. 
</P>
<P>
	For Atlanta, this is one last chance to win that elusive second  
Series title. The Braves reached the final eight NLCS of the decade 
and lead the majors with an 860-532 regular-season record since 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've persevered through so much this year. Everybody's kind  
of drained,'' Chipper Jones said. ``Luckily we've got a couple of 
days off here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Yankees, whose 784-607 record since 1991 is second-best  
in the majors, this is an opportunity to win their third Series 
title. New York reached the playoffs in the last five years of the 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Several key players have come and gone from both teams since the  
'96 Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Among others, the Braves have added Jordan, Rocker, Millwood,  
Bret Boone and lost Marquis Grissom, Mark Lemke, Fred McGriff and 
Mark Wohlers, who served up the pivotal home run to Jim Leyritz in 
Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is the best team we've ever had,'' Atlanta owner  
Ted Turner said after the Braves outlasted the Mets. ``We've got to 
go through both New York teams. Nobody has ever done that.''

<HEADLINE> 15 Kansas H.S. Players Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLATHE, Kan. (AP) -- Fifteen members of the Olathe East High  
School football team were suspended for one game for taking a 
dietary supplement that was blamed for one player's collapse last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The over-the-counter supplement, Ripped Fuel, can be bought  
legally at nutrition stores and is ``supposed to stimulate 
performance,'' Olathe East principal Karl Krawitz said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But while its use does not violate the school district's  
substance abuse policy, ``we felt that was beyond what we would 
contend is an expectation of this school and our program, and we 
felt we had to take action,'' Krawitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Olathe East football coach Jeff Meyers, whose team is 1-6 with  
two games remaining, suspended the 15 players for Thursday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	During a closed meeting with coaches, teammates and parents, the  
suspended players were ``very apologetic, not only to their 
teammates but to their coaches and the school,'' Krawitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplement is not recommended for use by people younger than  
18. Its label says the recommended dosage is two capsules three 
times a day, to a maximum of six capsules daily. 
</P>
<P>
	The player who fainted immediately following Friday night's 35-6  
loss to Olathe South took four capsules during the 2 1/2-hour game, 
according to Meyers. Meyers said the player was having breathing 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	A call was made to 911, he said, but once medical personnel  
arrived, they felt no need to take the player to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The player's name was not released because he is a minor.  
</P>
<P>
	Olathe East canceled its junior varsity game Saturday, Meyers  
said, because the team doctor said no player should compete within 
48 hours of taking the supplement.

<HEADLINE> Study: Menstrual Drugs The Same </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *AP Business News    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Merck &AMP; Co.-financed study on the  
effectiveness of its new pill in helping ease the discomfort of 
menstrual pain might have backfired on the world's largest drug 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The study showed Merck's pain pill Vioxx worked as well in  
relieving menstrual pain as the most widely ordered drug -- naproxen 
sodium-- which is about half the price of Vioxx. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts and a rival company on Tuesday said the study would  
make it difficult for Merck to justify its higher price. 
</P>
<P>
	``Merck needs to prove its product is superior, not  
comparable,'' said Hemant Shah, an analyst with HKS &AMP; Co. in 
Warren, N.J. ``Why should anyone use a more expensive drug that 
does the same thing?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Merck spokeswoman said its head-to-head study comparing Vioxx  
against the prescription dose of naproxen sodium (sold by Roche 
Pharmaceuticals under the brand name Anaprox DS) was not meant to 
compare cost-effectiveness. It was only meant to prove Vioxx works 
safely, said spokeswoman Mary Elizabeth Basaman. 
</P>
<P>
	The study evaluated 127 women across four menstrual cycles. Pain  
was compared eight and twelve hours after treatment was started. 
The research, conducted and financed by Merck, was reported in this 
month's issue of Obstetrics and Gynecology. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA approved Vioxx in May for the treatment of  
osteoarthritis, acute pain in adults, and treatment of menstrual 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Vioxx, one of the hottest-selling new drugs this year, is locked  
in a major battle with another new arthritis pain drug, Celebrex, 
sold by both Pfizer and Monsanto. 
</P>
<P>
	Though arthritis treatments will account for most Vioxx and  
Celebrex sales, the companies are making considerable efforts to 
win federal approval for additional uses. Celebrex does not have 
the menstrual pain indication. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA said Vioxx and Celebrex reduce arthritis pain with  
significantly less risk of stomach side-effects such as ulcers 
compared with other prescription arthritis drugs as well as 
aspirin. 
</P>
<P>
	But those stomach side-effects are more likely to effect people  
who take pain medications every day, not women who might use a drug 
to treat their menstrual pain a couple of days a month. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, it might be difficult for Merck to claim that Vioxx  
is worth a premium price compared to naproxen sodium. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50 milligram Vioxx used in the study sells for $4.04 per  
day. The 550 milligram naproxen sodium sell for $2.18 per day. 
</P>
<P>
	A Merck spokeswoman said for some doctors and patients, cost may  
not be a consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, increasingly health insurers are using cost as a factor in  
deciding which new drugs to cover. 
</P>
<P>
	David Tantillo, a director of new product planning for Roche  
Pharmaceuticals, said the Merck study-- when price is considered-- 
validates his own company's pain pill. He said the side-effect 
advantage that Vioxx has with arthritis pain, ``goes by the 
wayside'' when it come to menstrual pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they've done is introduced a new type of therapy that  
offers some of the same pain relieving benefits as existing 
therapies,'' Tantillo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Charles Debrovner, a New York City  
obstetrician-gynecologist, said menstruating women who use 
traditional pain medications can still get gastrointestinal 
side-effects, though the probability is less than arthritis 
patients using such drugs every day. 
</P>
<P>
	He said in his practice he is more likely to use the ``less  
expensive, equally effective drugs'' such as naproxen sodium, 
unless a problem develops.

	No Need to Quit Your Day Job -- Job hunters don't care if their  
current bosses find out they're looking for a new place to work. A 
new survey by research firm Cyber Dialogue found job seekers are 
comfortable advertising their skills on the Internet. Out of nearly 
400 people who sought a job online in the past year, 80 percent had 
no qualms about posting their resume for prying eyes. Nearly nine 
out of 10 respondents reported being satisfied with online job 
search sites. Among the most wanted features: job listings 
containing detailed information (93 percent), and relevant results 
to job searches (92 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	And while cybersurfing primarily takes place at home (93  
percent) 59 percent of the respondents also access the Web, 
including job sites, while at work. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was sponsored by online employment site CareerMosaic.

	Good Boss? Bad Boss? -- When it comes to ranking the boss,  
Americans say it's all in the attitude. A national survey of 1,000 
people chosen at random by Personnel Decisions International, a 
global management and human resources consulting firm, found 37 
percent of people surveyed identified ``communication skills or 
interpersonal skills'' as the most important quality in a good 
boss. Ability to understand employees' needs and help in developing 
skills came in second, with 19 percent. And 18 percent said good 
day-to-day decisions mattered most.

	To Have and to Hold? -- The steep falls and rises in mutual funds  
leave investors searching for yellow warning flags as to when to 
sell and when to hang on to their investments. Mutual Funds 
magazine suggests you do your homework before cashing in. The 
investment magazine says in order to measure performance you have 
to understand its workings. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not enough to track performance, you have to understand the  
behavior. Look at annual or semiannual reports as a benchmark. Be 
weary of changes in management and shifts in company philosophies. 
If you decide to sell, timing is key. A fund that has performed 
well raises capital-gains-taxes; unless you're in a tax deferred 
account. To lower tax impact, try to offset gains by selling other 
funds that aren't performing as well.

<HEADLINE> GOP, Clinton Battle Over Nukes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP)-- Congressional Republicans are threatening to  
take the government's nuclear weapons programs out of the Energy 
Department if the Clinton administration undermines creation of a 
partially autonomous nuclear agency within the department. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson was expected to face sharp  
questioning today from senators who charge that the administration 
is sidestepping a law enacted earlier this month that creates the 
new internal DOE agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute over the new National Nuclear Security  
Administration has the Clinton administration locked in a bitter 
dispute with Republican lawmakers over the future management of 
nuclear weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans argue that security at the labs won't  
be improved until the nuclear weapons programs, including the labs, 
are put under a new agency that is insulated from the rest of the 
Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, senior administration officials are miffed that those  
same Republican lawmakers refused to provide $35 million that 
Richardson had wanted to beef up computer security at the weapons 
labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress also refused to give Richardson money he had sought to  
improve the monitoring of foreign visitors to the weapons labs. 
This, they complain, after GOP lawmakers were the loudest in 
complaining about lax computer security and how visitors posed a 
potential espionage threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted better security but won't give me the tools,''  
Richardson said angrily, referring to the budget shortfall during a 
recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's the administration's response to the creation of a new  
agency within the DOE to insulate nuclear weapons programs that has 
prompted the loudest GOP criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Creating the agency was Congress' most significant response to  
the charges of alleged spying and security lapses at the nuclear 
weapons labs. Many lawmakers thought the agency was badly needed to 
bring greater accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton signed the measure on Oct. 5, Sen. Pete Dominic  
R-N.M., said it ushers in ``a new era where security and 
accountability are the rule, not turf-squabbles and 
finger-pointing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton had no choice to sign the popular defense  
authorization bill, which contained pay raises and spending 
increases for the military, the president said he was troubled by 
the DOE reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson insists he is not opposed to a new semiautonomous  
nuclear agency. But he argued that Congress gave too much 
independence to the agency, made it unaccountable to other DOE 
offices responsible for environmental, health and security matters, 
and blocked the secretary from deciding how agency money was spent 
or what personnel were hired. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that stunned GOP lawmakers, Clinton ordered Richardson  
to assume the job as head of the new agency, and then directed that 
Richardson fill key jobs, such as counterintelligence, 
environmental and health protection and security posts, by 
officials already holding those posts within the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an absolute frontal attack on Congress,'' complained  
Domenici at a recent Armed Service Committee hearing where 
Richardson was testifying. 
</P>
<P>
	When Richardson said the president directed him to follow the  
law, and that he would do so, Domenici called the explanation 
``pious'' and cut the secretary off. ``I don't want any comments 
from you. I'm fed up,'' Domenici snapped and then left the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of the House Armed Services  
Committee, warned that ``continuing to engage in this battle'' 
would prompt Congress to take the nuclear programs entirely out of 
the Energy Department. He said creation of an independent agency 
like NASA to manage America's nuclear warheads and do weapons 
research ``already has substantial support'' especially in the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republicans talked of retaliating by withholding funds for  
DOE senior staff or department programs, but administration 
officials noted that Congress already has passed the Energy 
Department's key spending bills for fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson was to appear today before a joint hearing of the  
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Governmental 
Affairs Committee.

<HEADLINE> Storms Wreck U.S. Liberty Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- The last of the liberty trees -- where  
American colonists once incited rebellion against the British -- 
will be cut down because of extensive damage from storms and decay. 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's College, where the 400-year-old tulip poplar is  
located, accepted the recommendation of a tree expert that it is 
unsafe and must come down. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds from Hurricane Floyd last month fractured the trunk and  
the tree now endangers anything near it, arborist Russell Carlson 
said in a report to the state and St. John's College. 
</P>
<P>
	The college has not yet set a date for cutting down the tree,  
spokeswoman Barbara Goyette said in a statement Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty trees where the Sons of Liberty met and plotted the  
American Revolution existed in most if not all of the 13 colonies 
and were a potent Revolutionary War symbol. Maryland's is the last 
surviving Liberty Tree. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two were destroyed by British forces, said Edward  
Papenfuse, Maryland state archivist. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Boston, they chopped the tree into 14 cords of wood and  
used it as firewood for the soldiers. In Charleston, they were so 
intent on eradicating the tree that they burned the stump,'' 
Papenfuse said. Others were cut down or lost to disease or old age, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report submitted Oct. 9, Carlson said ``despite a  
monumental effort'' to protect Maryland's tree, it ``is now 
structurally weakened to a degree that it poses a hazard to any 
person or object within reach of its branches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the great care given by St. John's College, including  
preservation efforts as far back as 1907, the tree suffered many 
hardships over the years, including lightning strikes and damage 
from earlier hurricanes, Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is largely held together with concrete and metal cables. Any  
more elaborate artificial support, Carlson said, ``would be an 
obtrusive and ignominious life support system for this grand old 
champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, it is time to say goodbye to our old friend,''  
Carlson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Morrill, spokesman for Gov. Parris Glendening, said the  
governor was ``extraordinarily sad that the arborist did not have 
better news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tree has at least one offspring growing nearby. And this  
spring, state officials arranged for cuttings to be taken from the 
tree so clones could be produced as part of a millennium 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	Louise Hayman, director of the commission that handled the  
procedure, said Monday the cloning appears to be going well, but 
scientists won't know until the end of the year if it will succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	If it does, a new tree will be planted in Annapolis and  
seedlings will be presented to the 49 other states.

<HEADLINE> Gore Wants Clinton To Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite earlier comments that he was  
considering declining the president's help, Vice President Al Gore 
on Tuesday told Congressional Progressive Caucus members that 
President Clinton will campaign on behalf of his White House bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore ``made clear that the president is a friend who has been  
campaigning for him and will continue to campaign for him, but that 
every election is about the future and that it will be about his 
ideas and his vision for the 21st Century,'' said spokesman Chris 
Lehane. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore told the Washington Post last week he considered the  
campaign a ``very personal quest'' and indicated that he hadn't 
decided what role Clinton would play. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Clinton himself said: ``No one can help anyone else  
in a campaign beyond a certain point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, however, made it clear Tuesday that Clinton would be  
involved in the campaign -- but also that he needs to maintain his 
own identity to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``He explained the difference between being vice president and  
being a candidate for president,'' said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., 
who was at the meeting. ``He was explaining that he is more and 
more becoming his own man without contradicting or repudiating the 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Democrat at the meeting, Rep. James McGovern of  
Massachusetts, said Gore was careful not to distance himself too 
much from Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't try to distance himself from the president,''  
McGovern said. ``He said what he needs to do is make a direct 
connection with the American people, that people will vote for him 
on whether they think he will be a good president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, former  
Sen. Bill Bradley, plans to meet with the group on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides his relationship with Clinton, Gore also discussed a  
proposed minimum wage increase, the earned income tax credit, the 
administration's plan to encourage investment in poor and rural 
areas and Bradley's health care plan.

<HEADLINE> IBM Pulls PCs Out of U.S. Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Big Blue is giving itself the Big Boot.  
</P>
<P>
	IBM, whose name has been synonymous with personal computers for  
two decades, said Tuesday it is pulling its money-losing line of 
PCs from retail stores in the United States and will sell them 
exclusively over the Internet in a drastic move to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Aptiva PCs will disappear from shelves starting Jan. 1. IBM's  
ThinkPad laptops, which are profitable, will continue to be 
available in stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The retreat underscores the enormous pressure facing the  
nation's third-largest PC maker. IBM's Personal Systems Group, 
which sells PCs to both consumers and businesses, lost about $150 
million in the second quarter and nearly $1 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	By withdrawing its PCs from about 70 U.S. retail chains, IBM  
saves on the fees stores typically charge to display and stock 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to restore this business to profitability,'' IBM  
spokeswoman Trink Guarino said. Moving out of stores ``will save us 
a lot of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To buoy awareness of the Aptiva brand and encourage people to  
visit its ShopIBM Web site, which it is redesigning, IBM plans to 
launch a $20 million advertising campaign early next year that will 
include television and direct mail. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, a one-time PC pioneer, is the latest technology company to  
be squeezed by price wars and a surge in component costs. Dell 
Computer Corp. warned on Monday its third-quarter profits will be 
hurt by rising chip prices stemming from the Taiwan earthquake last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM is expected to report its third-quarter financial results on  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's move comes two weeks after it started cutting 500 to 1,000  
employees from its PC business as it consolidates several brands 
under one marketing umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
	The retreat by IBM is a stunning reversal from its launch of the  
first home computer in the early 1980s, when it started selling an 
affordable box-like device that sat on people's desks. Even though 
IBM was overtaken by sellers of cheaper PCs, such as Compaq 
Computer Corp., home machines became widely known as ``IBM 
clones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To differentiate its products, IBM introduced the Aptiva in  
1994. But IBM reacted sluggishly in 1997 to a profound shift in 
consumer buying behavior -- PCs that cost less than $1,000. After 
finally tagging on, IBM subsequently shied away from this year's 
hot budget item: home PCs under $600, which accounted for nearly 
half of all store sales this past August. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say IBM, which makes many of its own computer parts,  
has difficulty keeping down costs in contrast to rivals that buy 
more heavily from cheaper outside suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	``IBM has always wanted to stay away from the low end,'' said  
Matt Sargent, an analyst with the ZD InfoBeads research firm, based 
in La Jolla, Calif. ``They just aren't as low cost a producer'' as 
some rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's move to eliminate store sales takes its cue from Dell and  
Gateway Inc., the two largest direct sellers of PCs to customers. 
By eliminating wholesalers and retailers, the companies have shaved 
costs, created customer loyalty and prompted competitors to become 
copycats. 
</P>
<P>
	But IBM has a tough task ahead of it.  
</P>
<P>
	Dell sells mostly business PCs to corporate customers, a more  
tech-savvy group that generally knows what type of computers to 
buy. Home computer users are more of a ``kick-the-tire'' crowd, 
preferring to try out a PC before buying it. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Gateway sells most of its computers to home users, it  
operates its own ``Country Store'' outlets to help walk consumers 
through the buying process. A survey early this year by ZD 
InfoBeads found that 41 percent of consumers who bought an IBM 
Aptiva would consider buying a Gateway as their next computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, IBM's Web destination is considered harder to navigate  
than online sites from Dell and Gateway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think IBM's move to direct is a mistake,'' Sargent  
said. ``I just don't think IBM is going to make the transition (to 
online sales) well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's stock was up 12 1/2 cents a share at $107.12 1/2 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Dockworkers Terminating Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Dock workers are moving toward calling a strike  
that would cripple the islands. 
</P>
<P>
	The union representing Hawaii's dockworkers terminated its  
contract with four shipping companies Monday night, creating 
uncertainty for island residents almost totally dependent on ships 
to deliver food and other goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 142 gave  
notice Friday to the Hawaii Employers Council that it would 
terminate the current contract at 6 p.m. Monday, a move union 
leaders hoped would bring a sense of urgency to negotiations with 
four shipping companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-one union stevedores on Maui voted unanimously Monday to  
authorize a strike, following the lead of 17 workers on Kauai who 
voted Sunday night. A vote is set for today for dock workers on the 
island of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the earliest there could be a strike would be this  
weekend, after votes for the islands Oahu and Hawaii are tallied. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all dockworkers are on Oahu, and they are set to vote on  
Friday night. The union represents about 500 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	A dock strike could be very damaging to Hawaii, which depends on  
ships to deliver 90 percent of it goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The current contract expired June 30, but was extended by both  
sides and could be terminated with 72 hours notice. 
</P>
<P>
	The ILWU chose to terminate the contract after a federal judge  
last week ordered the union to end a work slowdown that had nearly 
crippled unloading of freight and creating delays for distributors 
and suppliers of everything from fresh foods to cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The council represents four shipping companies -- Matson  
Terminals Inc., Hawaii Stevedores Inc., McCabe Hamilton &AMP; Renney 
Co., and HT&AMP;T Co.

<HEADLINE> Bear Cub Rabbies Scare Disproved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- A third test has shown rabies is not the  
likely cause of death of a bear cub that came into contact with as 
many as 400 tourists this summer, health officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial tests at Iowa State University had shown the 5-month-old  
bear died of rabies on Aug. 27, prompting health officials to urge 
vaccinations for those who could have come into contact with the 
potentially fatal disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Days later, however, tests at two other laboratories were unable  
to reproduce the positive rabies test. A third test -- considered 
more definitive -- has also led veterinarians to believe there was 
no rabies danger from the bear. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weight of the evidence (indicates) there's a pretty low  
probability it was rabies,'' said Gary Osweiler, director of the 
Veterinary Diagnostics Laboratory in Ames told The Des Moines 
Register in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Although saliva from the animal must penetrate the skin to  
transmit the disease, doctors warned that no chances should be 
taken. Dozens of people chose to have the shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why was this mistake made?'' said Robin Martin who was exposed  
to the cub along with her 9-year-old daughter at the Wild Midwest 
Petting Zoo in Clermont and went through a series of rabies 
vaccinations. 
</P>
<P>
	Tammy Stadtler of Spring Grove, Minn., said it cost almost  
$4,000 to vaccinate her children, Brittany, 10, and Jeffrey, 8. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just got a denial from my insurance in the mail,'' Stadtler  
said. ``My insurance claims that rabies (shots) are preventive and 
they don't cover preventive measures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Osweiler said he couldn't explain the initial positive test.  
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is that science is never clear,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Encyclopaedia Britannica, the longtime leader in  
information that has lost its way in the Internet era, is giving 
away its knowledge for free in a desperate bid to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	As of today, the publisher's 32-volume set is available to  
anyone who surfs the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The only catch: You have to wade through advertisements --  
Britannica's source of revenue for the risky move -- to get your 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire Britannica -- from a-ak (an ancient East Asian music)  
to Zoroastrianism (a Persian religion) -- can be found at the 
Chicago company's retooled site, www.britannica.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to emulate the success of Amazon, Yahoo and others, the  
site also offers current information from newspapers, news agencies 
and 70 magazines as well as community services such as e-mail, 
weather forecasts and financial market reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the new company, split off by the publishing company  
to house its digital properties, Britannica.com Inc., tried to put 
the best spin on the venture, calling this ``a momentous day for 
knowledge seekers everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Purchasing the Encyclopaedia Britannica was once a major  
milestone in a family's life, but today we are fulfilling our 
promise to make it more accessible to more people worldwide,'' said 
Don Yannias, the new company's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	But giving up its prime asset for free -- bound volumes still go  
for about $1,250 a set -- shows the straits into which the 
231-year-old company has fallen. 
</P>
<P>
	Encyclopaedia Britannica had revenue of $650 million and a sales  
force of 2,300 at its peak in 1989. Revenue estimates are no longer 
available from the privately held company, where the work force is 
thought to number about 350. 
</P>
<P>
	The company lost ground badly when Microsoft Corp., after being  
spurned by Britannica, teamed with discount-market encyclopedia 
publisher Funk &AMP; Wagnalls to produce a colorful, multimedia 
encyclopedia on CD-ROM in 1993. Britannica's own CD-ROM version, 
released a year later, was low on graphics and did not fare well. 
</P>
<P>
	It also became the first encyclopedia available on the Web in  
1994, but the reception was muted by the $85-a-year subscription 
fee. 
</P>
<P>
	House calls by salesmen, once a company trademark, were dropped  
in 1996.

</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's legislature appeared ready  
to grant East Timor independence today and debated who they will 
choose to be the country's next president in a vote scheduled for 
tomorrow. Outside the legislature, thousands of supporters of 
President B.J. Habibie and his rival, Megawati Sukarnoputri, 
clogged the streets of Jakarta. Legislators spoke today in favor of 
ending Indonesia's 24-year occupation of East Timor and accepting 
the results of an independence referendum there six weeks ago.

	GOP, Clinton Battle Over Nuclear Weapons  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP)-- Congressional Republicans are threatening to  
take the government's nuclear weapons programs out of the Energy 
Department if the Clinton administration undermines creation of a 
partially autonomous nuclear agency within the department. Energy 
Secretary Bill Richardson was expected to face sharp questioning 
today from senators who charge that the administration is 
sidestepping a law enacted earlier this month that creates the new 
internal DOE agency. The dispute over the new National Nuclear 
Security Administration has the Clinton administration locked in a 
bitter dispute with Republican lawmakers over the future management 
of nuclear weapons programs.

	Social Security Checks To Increase  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 44.2 million Americans getting Social  
Security checks will see them grow by 2.4 percent next year, the 
biggest cost of living increase in three years. The 2000 increase 
will be nearly twice the size of this year's 1.3 percent raise, 
mainly because of a recent upward creep in consumer prices. Social 
Security Commissioner Kenneth S. Apfel said today that the 
cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, means the average monthly check 
for retirees will rise by $19, from $785 to $804.

	Jewish Settlers Resist Dismantling

<P>
	SHVUT RACHEL, West Bank (AP) -- Despite promises to go quietly,  
Jewish settlers resisted the government's first attempt to 
dismantle an illegal settlement outpost in the West Bank today. 
Several dozen settlers sat on a makeshift barricade of boulders, 
rusty tin barrels and old tires, blocking the path of a flatbed 
truck that was to cart away a large storage container they had 
planted to claim a hilltop. The protest came despite a compromise 
worked out last week between Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the 
Jewish Settlers' Council.

Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stood under a cloudless sky 
in an open field today to acknowledge one of them. Several hundred 
Malian soldiers wearing green berets were gathered on the field and 
heard Albright praise them for their role in peacekeeping efforts 
in several African countries. Three years ago, Mali was the first 
country on the continent to agree to take part in a U.S.-sponsored

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP Set To Meet on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House set a combative tone for  
budget talks with Republicans, telling GOP congressional leaders to 
``put aside their talking points and their attack ads'' when they 
meet with President Clinton this evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, meanwhile, said they would put Clinton on notice  
that they will not raise taxes or use Social Security surpluses to 
pay for the extra spending that the president wants. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton hoped to  
reach a ``framework'' for a wider budget agreement but ``has no 
particular mechanism in mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides are meeting nearly three weeks into the new fiscal  
year with only five of the 13 annual spending bills approved. Five 
others have either been vetoed or face veto threats over issues 
including hiring teachers and police officers and blocking tougher 
environmental requirements for some oil and mining companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president hopes to find a way to get to agreement where we  
can maintain our fiscal discipline and our priorities,'' Lockhart 
told reporters. ``I think he hopes Republicans can put aside their 
talking points and their attack ads, come down and be honest and 
straightforward and work through these problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But with neither party ready to go to the brink, Congress  
planned as early as today to approve an eight-day extension of the 
temporary measure that has kept federal agencies open since fiscal 
2000 started on Oct. 1. The first stopgap bill expires Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to reach out a hand of friendship and hope that  
we can work together,'' Clinton said Monday night in Newark, N.J., 
where he attended a Democratic fund-raising event. 
</P>
<P>
	That hand is being extended as relations between the White House  
and Congress, already soured by Clinton's impeachment trial, have 
worsened. Last week's Senate rejection of the nuclear test ban 
treaty, a top administration foreign policy goal, has sparked 
bitter accusations of partisanship from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand about public discourse in this town. Sometimes it  
gets colorful,'' acknowledged Armey, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget  
office, the White House says even without meeting all of Clinton's 
budget demands, GOP spending plans would spend billions in Social 
Security surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's budget wouldn't spend the Social Security  
surplus,'' said White House budget director Jack Lew. ``Congress 
has said they want to do the same thing. We don't believe they 
have. We need to work out our differences in a fiscally responsible 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed paying for additional spending by raising  
tobacco taxes, levies charged industry to cover toxic waste 
cleanups and other revenues -- proposals Republicans have turned 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their differences, the two sides' differences pale  
compared with the clashes of 1995 and 1996, when GOP efforts to 
abolish entire agencies like the Education Department helped prompt 
two federal shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the five bills in the center of this year's spending fight,  
Clinton wants less than $10 billion over what Republicans have 
offered, a tiny portion of the nearly $600 billion that the annual 
spending bills control. 
</P>
<P>
	And in recent weeks, Republicans have added billions of dollars  
to move closer to Clinton's proposals. Those bills cover the 
departments of Interior, Commerce, Justice, State, Labor, 
Education, Health and Human Services, and foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	But the two sides have philosophical differences, such as how  
extensive state control over federal education aid should be. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Clinton vetoed a $12.7 billion foreign aid bill that  
fell $2 billion below his request. It omitted any of the $500 
million he wants for Israel and the Palestinians to implement the 
accord they struck last year at Wye River, Md. It also provided 
less than he wanted for international debt relief and efforts to 
reduce the nuclear threat from Russia, North Korea and other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Though both sides stood to gain by holding a meeting that would  
let them appear reasonable, it was unclear what the session would 
achieve. There were some hopes on both sides that it would lead to 
a series of lower-level meetings where remaining differences could 
be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, House and Senate Republicans agreed Monday to a  
compromise $37 billion measure financing the Commerce, Justice and 
State departments. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans added about $1.5 billion to it, but Democrats said  
Clinton would probably veto it anyway. It still contains about $2 
billion less than he wants, including less than half his $1.3 
billion request for hiring local police officers.

<HEADLINE> FDA Goes Public With Biotech Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration will hold  
unusual meetings around the country this fall to hear what 
Americans think about bioengineered food. 
</P>
<P>
	Buoyed by a backlash in Europe and elsewhere, U.S. critics have  
increased demands that bioengineered foods be labeled here. Two 
U.S. baby-food makers even announced they no longer would use 
biotech ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
	Health experts insist biotech foods now sold are safe. They  
already are used widely, from the soybeans and corn of tortilla 
chips and soft drinks to tomatoes stewed into spaghetti sauce. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although people have enthusiastically accepted new drugs made  
from biotechnology, some consumers have concerns about the use of 
this technology in foods,'' said Health and Human Services 
Secretary Donna Shalala. ``We need to ask why those concerns exist, 
and how we can address them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So the FDA begins unusual public meetings next month to explain  
how it determines a genetically engineered food is safe, and to get 
the public's reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Meetings will be in Chicago on Nov. 18, Washington on Nov. 30  
and in Oakland, Calif., on Dec. 13.

<HEADLINE> Subject of 'A Love Divided' Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEXFORD, Ireland (AP) -- Sean Cloney, a Catholic farmer whose  
marriage to his Protestant childhood sweetheart engulfed a rural 
community in sectarianism, died Tuesday. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Cloney died in Wexford Hospital from pneumonia.  
</P>
<P>
	The story of Cloney and his wife, the former Sheila Kelly, was  
made into an Irish film last year called ``A Love Divided,'' which 
reflected deep-rooted religious divides and the sway of the 
Catholic clergy in rural Ireland in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Cloney's decision to educate her daughters at home instead  
of a Catholic school in the village of Fethard-on-Sea, in County 
Wexford, prompted a parish priest to orchestrate a 1957 boycott of 
Protestant businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The boycott ended when the Kelly family and the local lawmaker,  
a Catholic, made a joint appeal and a priest bought a pack of 
cigarettes from a Protestant-owned shop. Mrs. Cloney continued to 
educate her children at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Catholic Bishop Brendan Comiskey, whose diocese covers much of  
County Wexford, apologized publicly for the boycott at a 1998 
ecumenical service in Wexford and promised ``to do whatever I can 
to make amends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cloney, who had been paralyzed from the neck down since a 1995  
operation that went wrong, had expressed delight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a difficult thing to apologize, though it is a source of  
regret that it has taken 41 years,'' he said at the time. 
``Nevertheless, I am glad to have lived to see this day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cloney is survived by his wife, and their daughters Eileen and  
Hazel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cloney's funeral Mass will be held Thursday in Wexford's  
Templeton Catholic Church.

<HEADLINE> Pilots May Buy Stake in American </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines' pilots union, bruised in a  
yearlong fight with management, is considering buying a stake in 
the nation's No. 2 carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Three union locals have petitioned the Allied Pilots Association  
to consider turning American's parent, AMR Corp., into an 
employee-owned company. The issue will be on the agenda when 
directors of the union, which represents 9,800 American pilots, 
meets next week near Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The locals asked the board to create an exploratory committee  
including outside airline-industry analysts to study the 
possibility of creating an employee stock-ownership plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is an outgrowth of the frustration we're  
experiencing in our relations with management of American 
Airlines,'' said union spokesman Drew Engelke. 
</P>
<P>
	Angered over Fort Worth-based American's plans to absorb tiny  
Reno Air and its lower-paid pilots, about one-fourth of American's 
pilots called in sick during a 10-day stretch in February. The 
company said the sickout cost it $225 million, and a federal judge 
fined the union $45.5 million for disobeying a back-to-work order. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates for union office have previously raised the issue of  
creating an employee stock-ownership plan to buy part of AMR, but 
the issue has never come close to fruition, Engelke said. He said 
there is at least some opposition now. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were people who spoke on both sides of the issue''  
before the three locals, he said, ``and I don't believe any of the 
resolutions passed unanimously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for American said the airline would not comment on  
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, pilots, machinists and nonunion employees bought 55  
percent of United Airlines in return for accepting $4.9 billion in 
pay and benefit cuts over six years. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the United employee buyout occurred when United was in  
financial difficulty. American is profitable, which analysts 
suggested made the possibility of a takeover much less likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't regard this as very serious,'' said Glenn Engel, an  
analyst with Goldman Sachs. ``The union leadership is politically 
wounded from their miscues earlier this year. This is as much an 
internal political move as anything else.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Honors Hank Aaron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House joined the Senate on Tuesday in  
honoring baseball great Hank Aaron, who made baseball history a 
quarter-century ago by breaking Babe Ruth's career home run record. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one day I know I'll never forget,'' the former Braves  
slugger said after the House unanimously approved a resolution 
recognizing him as one of the sport's greatest players. The Senate 
approved a similar resolution last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no one more deserving than Hank Aaron to receive  
recognition from the people's House,'' said Rep. Saxby Chambliss, 
R-Ga., who with Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., sponsored the resolution. 
``He captivated baseball fans in Georgia and across America and 
taught us to follow our dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron hit his 715th home run on April 4, 1974, to break Ruth's  
long-standing record of 714. By the time he retired in 1976, Aaron 
had 755 home runs, 2,297 RBIs -- also a major league record -- and a 
.305 lifetime batting average. He was elected to the Baseball Hall 
of Fame in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	During a brief discussion on the House floor, lawmakers praised  
Aaron not only for his baseball exploits but for his work since 
leaving baseball with the Chasing the Dream Foundation, which he 
founded to help children aged 9 to 12 achieve their goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sanford Bishop, D-Ga., who grew up in the same Mobile,  
Ala., community as Aaron, said the record-breaking home run was 
``just one of many shining moments in a lifetime of truly 
extraordinary accomplishments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., praised Aaron for his ``level  
temperament'' during the home run chase when he was faced daily 
with death threats and racial harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	``He diligently and quietly and professionally, day in and day  
out, pursued and finally caught the Babe,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron said the congressional resolution capped a ``truly  
wonderful year'' for him, which also included a visit to Atlanta by 
President Clinton in February to help raise $1 million for his 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we can take Chasing a Dream not only into Atlanta, but  
we can take it all around the world,'' Aaron said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my dream, because I felt and I still feel that if it  
had not been for some people in Mobile, Ala., who helped me when I 
was a youngster growing up, that my dream would never have been 
fulfilled.''

<HEADLINE> Auburn Suspends Two Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Auburn kicker Rob Bironas and linebacker  
Shawn Shaw were suspended for the rest of the season Tuesday for 
violating team rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have rules that our team must abide by and when they don't,  
we must take disciplinary action,'' Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bironas and Shaw will miss Auburn's (3-4, 1-4 Southeastern  
Conference) final four games. 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't Bironas' first run-in with Tuberville. A preseason  
All-SEC selection, Bironas was criticized by Tuberville for most of 
August for what the coach called ``atrocious kicking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The junior was 1-for-4 on field-goal attempts this season before  
he lost his starting job to Damon Duval. Against Mississippi State, 
Duval was not supposed to play because of disciplinary action 
against him, but had to when Tuberville suspended Bironas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bironas was reinstated, but Tuberville again suspended him  
before last week's game against Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the rest of Auburn's kickers, snappers and holders, Bironas  
had his hair dyed platinum blonde. Tuberville reportedly told him 
to change it and Bironas showed up the next day with it dyed bright 
orange.

	Shaw, a sophomore inside linebacker, had 19 tackles in six  
games.

<HEADLINE> Germans Protest Austerity Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Tens of thousands of public workers marched  
through Berlin on Tuesday in the first major protest against the 
German government's austerity budget, demanding an end to the pay 
gap between workers in the west and former communist east and 
bigger raises for all. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 60,000 protesters rallied outside Chancellor Gerhard  
Schroeder's offices and at City Hall in central Berlin to vent 
their anger at government plans to limit salary increases for civil 
servants to the rate of inflation over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bureaucrats, garbage collectors, railway workers, teachers and  
others blew shrill whistles and hoisted placards reading ``We're 
being cheated.'' The civil service employees delivered a petition 
at the chancellery. 
</P>
<P>
	The pay squeeze for Germany's 2 million civil servants is part  
of spending cuts Schroeder proposed last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor unions, which organized the protest, charged the  
government is pre-empting the next round of contract negotiations 
for public employees and was trying to set the tone for wage talks 
in other parts of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Erhard Geyer, head of a civil servants' association, accused the  
government of arrogance. ``This is a deep affront,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers from eastern Germany also were angry that their pay  
continues to lag western levels, 10 years after the collapse of the 
Berlin Wall. Firefighters from eastern Berlin hung a banner on a 
rescue ladder that said: ``Rescue 100 percent, earn 86.5 percent -- 
that stinks to high heaven!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The opposition Christian Democrats also called on Schroeder's  
Social Democratic government to act more quickly to equalize pay 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The government ``should develop a bit more sensitivity for  
east-west feelings and, ultimately, for the nation's growing 
together,'' opposition lawmaker Erwin Marschewski said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the government said all Germans must help it cut spending.  
</P>
<P>
	``Implementing the ambitious austerity program also requires a  
contribution by public employees,'' deputy interior minister 
Brigitte Zypries said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	She noted that government workers' pay would actually rise --  
just less than in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder's unpopular proposals to cut cherished social programs  
next year have triggered election losses for his Social Democrats 
in six states over the last two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Many union officials and other supporters of the traditionally  
leftist party have turned against Schroeder because of his 
austerity plans.

<HEADLINE> Ryan White Foundation To Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) --The Ryan White Foundation, which bears the  
name of one America's earliest and youngest public faces of AIDS, 
is closing because of dwindling donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeanne White-Ginder, White's mother, said she will close the  
organization and join forces with another advocacy group, AIDS 
Action, at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't be up to me to bring in all the money now,'' she said  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	White-Ginder will lead the Washington-based group's Ryan White  
Project, a new effort to bolster AIDS education among young people 
and to lobby for continued federal funding for AIDS programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are combining our efforts to make sure that Ryan's legacy  
continues,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	White, a hemophiliac, contracted the virus through tainted  
blood-clotting products. His court battle to be allowed to attend 
school drew widespread attention. Celebrities such as Michael 
Jackson and Elton John befriended him and he was the subject of a 
television movie. 
</P>
<P>
	He died in 1990 at age 18. Later that year, White-Ginder started  
the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	At its height, the Indianapolis-based organization had four paid  
employees and an annual budget of about $250,000. But dwindling 
donations forced the layoff of full-time staff this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Its leaders attributed the drop in funds to beliefs that the  
AIDS crisis is over. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, ``the AIDS epidemic is in the midst of one of its worst  
crises yet -- the crisis of complacency,'' said Mark Maddox, the 
foundation's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug advances have prolonged the life of many AIDS patients, but  
the rate of new AIDS infections has remained constant at about 
40,000 a year for the past decade. About half of new infections are 
believed to be among Americans under 25, according to the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention.

<HEADLINE> Maryland Man Convicted of Killing Girl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- A convicted killer was found guilty of  
second-degree murder in the disappearance 13 years ago of a 
6-year-old girl whose body has never been found. 
</P>
<P>
	A Montgomery County jury Monday found Hadden Clark, 47,  
responsible for the death of Michele Dorr. Authorities now hope 
Clark will lead them to the little girl's remains. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel absolutely wonderful,'' said Dee Applebee, the girl's  
mother, after the three-week trial. Sentencing was scheduled for 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark already is serving a 30-year sentence for the 1992 murder  
of 23-year-old Laura Houghteling. He eventually led police to her 
body, not far from the Houghteling home. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark had been the chief suspect in Michele's disappearance for  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl was last seen playing in a wading pool at her father's  
home in May 1986. Prosecutors contended that on that day, Michele 
went to the home of a playmate, a niece of Clark's who lived near 
her, but that the only one at the home was the defendant. 
Prosecutors said Clark stabbed her to death, cleaned up as much of 
the blood as he could and put her body in a plastic bag. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA tests found blood on the floorboards in the house, according  
to arrest reports. Several of Clark's fellow prisoners also told 
authorities that he told them about killing a little girl, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark denied any part in the girl's disappearance. The defense  
alleged that the girl's father, Carl Dorr, killed her, a tactic 
State's Attorney Douglas Gansler called ``an outrageous 
distraction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dorr had tears in his eyes after the verdict and hugged his  
former wife, Mrs. Applebee. ``I was scared to death,'' Dorr said, 
explaining he feared the jury wouldn't convict. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors had the option of convicting Clark on the more serious  
charge of first-degree murder, but several said they did not think 
prosecutors had proved premeditation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Second degree was a compromise,'' juror Jerry Tulen said.  
</P>
<P>
	The trial featured the testimony of 60 witnesses and nearly 150  
pieces of evidence. Clark's murder conviction was not revealed to 
jurors during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no body. We have no weapon. We have no motive,''  
Gansler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for her remains has included digging at sites in  
Maryland and in New Jersey, where Clark's mother once lived. 
Officials also have looked in Wellfleet, Mass., where the Clark 
family once owned property, and in a storage locker Clark rented in 
Warwick, R.I.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Teens Oppose Legalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ESPANOLA, N.M. (AP) -- Teens in this city, known for its high  
rates of heroin addiction, have a message for the first sitting 
governor to advocate legalized narcotics: Come walk our 
drug-infested streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he's never had a family member or neighbor that has  
overdosed,'' David Medina, 17-year-old high school senior, said 
Monday. ``We've just grown up with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Gary Johnson, a Republican in his second term, drew strong  
criticism earlier this year when he voiced support for the 
legalization of cocaine, heroin and marijuana under strict controls 
and taxation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Control it. Regulate it. Tax it. If we legalize it, we just  
might have a better society,'' the governor told the libertarian 
Cato Institute, adding that the war on drugs has been a 
multibillion-dollar failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Espanola High School students in this middle-class, mostly  
Hispanic community along the Rio Grande said they want to take the 
governor on an in-depth tour of town. 
</P>
<P>
	``He should go trekking for trash on the back streets of our  
community to see how many syringes he can find,'' said Milena 
Archuleta, 16, a junior. 
</P>
<P>
	Archuleta said no one who has seen what goes on in her city  
could possibly want to legalize drugs. ``He has to be more aware of 
the problem. He doesn't bother to come and see. If he legalizes 
drugs it's only going to get worse,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1995, more than 90 people have died of heroin or cocaine  
overdoses in Rio Arriba County. 
</P>
<P>
	While New Mexico led the nation in drug-induced deaths last  
year, the county recorded the highest death rate in the state. In 
August, the U.S. Justice Department said the county's greatest 
health threats were drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	Davina Romero says the governor would be throwing in the towel  
if he legalized drugs. ``It seems like he's giving up on 
everything,'' said Romero, 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to explain his position to a teen-ager in Espanola, the  
governor said: ``I would be looking to improve on that situation 
... My motivation here is to actually reduce drug abuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he believes there's a place for anti-drug programs  
like DARE -- Drug Abuse Resistance Education -- and drug counselors 
in schools, but doesn't support the entire anti-drug message. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think so much of the drug war is based on untruth, and  
that's one of the problems when it comes to kids. They've been told 
that drugs fry your brain, drugs make you go crazy, drugs make you 
do crime, and of course marijuana's lumped in there,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Suffers Through 3rd Hurricane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Eastern North Carolina residents are  
struggling to raise their spirits after suffering through three 
straight hurricanes that have deluged the state with 4 feet of 
rain, damaged thousands of homes and turned lives upside down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope that it gets better soon,'' said Casheila Draughn,  
43. 
</P>
<P>
	She spoke Monday from a Red Cross center, a day after Hurricane  
Irene dropped up to 11 inches of rain onto the region. The storm 
veered out into the Atlantic late Sunday without making landfall in 
North Carolina, but it still brought heavy rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it can't be as bad as it was the last time, but I'm  
just hoping for life to get close to normal,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Normal may still be months away: Hundreds of people already live  
in camping trailers because their homes were damaged in floodwaters 
from Hurricane Floyd in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rains overwhelmed rivers and promised to produce more  
serious flooding later this week as runoff drains into the Tar, 
Neuse and Cape Fear rivers -- the last with crests 8 feet above 
flood stage expected. 
</P>
<P>
	To make matters worse, Tropical Storm Jose was swirling in the  
Caribbean and could reach hurricane strength later today. By this 
morning, its maximum sustained winds had increased to near 65 mph. 
Forecasters were uncertain of its track but said it could threaten 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	State transportation officials said Irene was responsible for  
156 road closings as of late Monday. That was on top of 75 roads 
that still remain closed in the aftermath of Floyd. Still, inland 
rainfall amounts in most areas were below more grave predictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were fortunate,'' Gov. Jim Hunt said Monday. ``It didn't  
turn out to be a great big thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people living in a government camper trailer park in  
Rocky Mount returned to their trailers Monday after spending Sunday 
night in a shelter. Schools in the area returned to a normal 
schedule today. 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Farrar, a Red Cross mental health counselor in Tarboro,  
said many people have become ``hypervigilant'' -- nervously mindful 
of every change of weather, every rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just demoralized,'' she said. ``They just want no more  
of this. The last one was more than they could handle, and now 
people are saying, `No way, Jose.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Irene was blamed for one death in North Carolina, a motorist  
whose vehicle hydroplaned into a tree Sunday in Granville County. 
Eight other people died as a result of the storm elsewhere, 
including five in Florida. A pair of Irene-spawned tornadoes were 
blamed for two injuries in North Carolina on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Cross has dispatched 244 mental health workers to  
eastern North Carolina to help flood victims cope. That is more 
than for any other disaster except the Oklahoma City bombing, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are overwhelmed right now by the fact that they have to  
clean up after the storms and be a mom and a dad and an employee,'' 
said Red Cross spokeswoman Gina Giarronardo. 
</P>
<P>
	First North Carolinians suffered through Hurricane Dennis, which  
battered the coast for a week and dumped up to 8 inches of rain. 
Two weeks later, Floyd poured 20 inches of rain, causing record 
flooding and 49 deaths. An additional 8 inches fell less than two 
weeks after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Irene arrived.  
</P>
<P>
	``You get lifted up and the next thing you know, something else  
happens,'' said Karen Mabry, who was flooded by Floyd and then 
watched Irene's floodwaters creep into Tarboro, 65 miles east of 
Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	The story was the same along South Carolina's coast.  
</P>
<P>
	A day after Irene swelled the Waccamaw River to almost 9 feet  
Monday -- or nearly 2 feet above flood stage -- Mary Roberts returned 
to her riverside home to find 8 inches of water sloshing in her 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lived here 42 years, and I've never had water in my  
house,'' said Roberts, who has no insurance. ``It's been 
heartbreaking. My floor just bulged up. My ceiling's cracked. My 
furniture's molded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Savannah Bluff, islands of craggy sand mounds protruded from  
bluish-black waters coursing across the road. Cars splashed 
single-file through the murky streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had carpet everywhere. It's in the Dumpster,'' said Dorothy  
Paul, pointing to a wobbly metal block in the sea of floating 
debris. She and her husband had planned to start repairs on their 
home this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think we'll wait till next week,'' said Paul, who is  
retired. ``Until those floors dry, we don't know what's going to 
happen. No one can predict this kind of weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pauls built in Savannah Bluff five years ago. Despite the  
flooding, they have no plans to leave the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you tell me where it's more likely there will be no  
earthquakes, no tornadoes, no hurricanes, no flooding -- you tell me 
where, and I'll move,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges End to 'Old Hatreds' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six months after the shooting at Columbine  
High School, President Clinton asked 350 students Tuesday to help 
rid society of ``old hatreds and old fears'' that spur violent kids 
and adults. 
</P>
<P>
	``You live in the most modern of all worlds, and yet the biggest  
problem we've got is the oldest problem of human society: people 
being scared of people who are different from them. And you can 
help that,'' Clinton told the students, who were selected for the 
two-day conference by 130 members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to live in the new world of the 21st century,  
you've got to help people get rid of their old hatreds and old 
fears,'' the president added. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also asked the students to ``speak up'' in support new  
civil rights protections for homosexuals. Sponsored by House 
Democrats, the ``Voices Against Violence'' conference was timed to 
coincide with the six-month anniversary of the Columbine massacre 
near Denver, in which two boys killed 12 fellow students and one 
teacher before killing themselves in the school library. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurred by those killings, the House and Senate passed competing  
versions of a bill designed to keep guns out of the hands of 
children and criminals, but a panel of lawmakers from both chambers 
has yet to strike a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Three GOP lawmakers sent students to the events -- Reps. Jennifer  
Dunn of Washington, Sue Kelly of New York and Connie Morella of 
Maryland -- but Republicans said that they had not been invited. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might have been better to put the politics of party  
division aside on this solemn day'' and invited Republicans to the 
conference, the chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary 
committees, Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois and Sen. Orrin Hatch of 
Utah, said in joint statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunn, for example, found out about the conference when a student  
from her district, Paul Kim of Lindberg High School near Seattle, 
asked the congresswoman if he could take part after hearing about 
the events from friends in a neighboring Democratic district, her 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim and his fellow conference members, selected by their  
representatives from essays they wrote about the causes of youth 
violence, climbed onto their chairs in the soaring caucus room and 
welcomed Clinton with whoops and cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	Katie Krummeck, 18, who attends Whitman College in Walla Walla,  
Wash., said Congress should ``get guns away, off the streets, out 
of accessibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she and other students said Congress and Clinton can only do  
so much. ``It's important to talk about the media, and causes, but 
when kids pick up the gun it's their choice -- they need to be 
responsible,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The students will have a chance during the conference to offer  
their views on why young people become violent and how to prevent 
school shooting sprees like those that have occurred in Colorado, 
Oregon, Arkansas, Georgia and Kentucky. They will present their 
findings to congressional leaders on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The school shootings intensified an already heated debate from  
Capitol Hill to Hollywood over gun control and violence in the 
media. The House and Senate this year passed competing versions of 
a juvenile justice bill that include new gun restrictions. A 
committee of lawmakers from those chambers has yet to strike a 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say Republicans are ``held hostage'' to the gun lobby  
-- part of which, the National Rifle Association, poured $850,000 
into its lobbying effort the first six months of the year. That's 
an increase of $100,000 over the same period the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP lawmakers say the restrictions pushed by Democrats would put  
gun shows and others dependent on the firearms industry out of 
business. Handgun Control Inc., the largest gun control 
organization, spent $340,000 on lobbying during the first half of 
the year, compared with $60,000 in 1998, according to federal 
records.

<HEADLINE> Braves, Mets Have Done This Before </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Game 5 of the NL Championship Series was an  
instant classic: two teams battling through 15 innings and nearly 
six hours in a driving rain before Robin Ventura's grand 
slam-single gave the Mets a 4-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have to be in another profession to put it into words,''  
New York manager Bobby Valentine said. ``I can't put it into 
words.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hmmm, that sounds familiar.  
</P>
<P>
	Before their 5-hour, 46-minute epic Sunday, both the Mets and  
Braves were involved in two of the greatest games in the 
three-decade-long history of the NLCS. 
</P>
<P>
	By most accounts, the granddaddy of them all is New York's 7-6  
victory over Houston in the deciding Game 6 of the 1986 series, a 
16-inning marathon filled with incredible twists and subplots. 
</P>
<P>
	Not far behind is Game 7 of the 1992 NLCS, when the Braves  
rallied from a 2-0 deficit in the ninth inning to beat the Pirates 
3-2 on pinch-hitter Francisco Cabrera's two-out, two-run single. 
The enduring memory was Sid Bream chugging around third on two 
aching knees, sliding into home just ahead of the tag, then getting 
buried under a pile of teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Add to the list: Ventura's bases-loaded shot over the  
right-field wall, which turned into a game-winning single when his 
teammates mobbed him before he reached second base. 
</P>
<P>
	``An unbelievable ballgame,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said.  
</P>
<P>
	Almost 13 years earlier, New York led the Astros 3-2 in the NLCS  
when the best-of-7 series returned to Houston with both teams 
facing must-win situations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros, obviously, couldn't afford another loss, while the  
Mets knew Mike Scott was ready to pitch for Houston if the series 
went the distance. He had been virtually unhittable: allowing just 
one run in two complete-game victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Knepper surrendered two hits through eight innings and the  
Astros, leading 3-0, were on the verge of playing another day. But 
what had been just another postseason game was about to become 
something special. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets rallied for three runs, capped by Ray Knight's  
sacrifice fly. In the 14th, New York was three outs from the 
pennant after Wally Backman's RBI single, but Billy Hatcher tied it 
up in the Astros' half with a one-out homer off the left-field foul 
pole. 
</P>
<P>
	New York seemed to put the game away by scoring three runs in  
the top of the 16th, but the Astros would not go quietly. They 
scored twice and had two runners on base with two outs when Kevin 
Bass came to bat against Jesse Orosco. After working the count to 
3-2, Bass swung at a low slider ... and missed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets had their pennant. Finally.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm emotionally drained,'' Knight said afterward. ``My legs  
are still shaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The record time of 4 hours, 42 minutes has since been eclipsed --  
heck, the Mets and Braves played more than an hour longer -- but the 
Astrodome thriller is still longest postseason game in history by 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a fan's standpoint, I don't see how you could have asked  
for much more,'' Astros pitcher Nolan Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Six years later, that theory was severely tested in an NLCS  
rematch between the Braves and Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta, having demonstrated that its worst-to-first of 1991 was  
no fluke, built a 3-1 lead over Pittsburgh in the series. But the 
Pirates routed the Braves 7-1 and 13-4 to set up a Game 7 at 
Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	In a reprise of Knepper's performance, Doug Drabek blanked the  
Braves through eight innings while the Pirates built a 2-0 lead. 
Three more outs, and Pittsburgh was heading to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	But Terry Pendleton led off the ninth with a double and second  
baseman Jose Lind bobbled David Justice's routine grounder for an 
error. The tomahawk-chopping crowd, resigned to defeat a few 
minutes earlier, could sense a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
	Drabek walked Bream to load the bases and Pirates manager Jim  
Leyland was forced to go to a bullpen that had been unreliable all 
year. Stan Belinda allowed a sacrifice fly to Ron Gant, cutting the 
lead to 2-1, then walked Damon Berryhill to load the bases again. 
</P>
<P>
	Belinda was on the verge of escaping when Brian Hunter popped  
out behind second. The Braves, their bench almost empty, sent up 
Cabrera, who had batted only 10 times all season. 
</P>
<P>
	Cabrera lined a shot into left field. Justice scored the tying  
run and Bream barely beat Barry Bonds' throw to the plate. It was 
the first time a team had won a decisive postseason game while 
trailing before the final pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been part of something that went from down there to  
up here so quick,'' Gant said. ``I was hyperventilating. I thought 
I was going to have a heart attack. I never dreamed of anything 
like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hmmm, that sounds familiar.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Agrees on 6 More Debates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Sen. Bill Bradley agreed Tuesday to six  
additional debates with Al Gore beginning in December. The vice 
president's rival campaign, which wanted more face-offs sooner, 
accused Bradley of stalling. 
</P>
<P>
	Their first debate will be Oct. 27 in Hanover, N.H.  
</P>
<P>
	The two Democratic presidential candidates mutually agreed upon  
three January forums: The Des Moines Register debate on Jan. 8 and 
the Jan. 17 Brown and Black Forum, in Des Moines, Iowa; and a 
debate sponsored by New Hampshire's WMUR-TV in Manchester on Jan. 
27. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa's Jan. 24 caucuses and the Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary are  
the first nominating contests of the presidential election season. 
</P>
<P>
	Other forums and dates remained in dispute between the two  
campaigns. The first debate Bradley offered to participate in is an 
ABC ``Nightline'' town hall meeting on Dec. 17 in Manchester. 
Others are a Dec. 19 forum on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' and one on 
Jan. 4 sponsored by The Union Leader of Manchester, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, painting himself as the underdog, had pushed for these and  
additional debates to be held much earlier -- including holding the 
Union Leader forum in the first week of November. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sen. Bradley has timidly accepted a few last-minute debate  
forums in order to dodge Al Gore's challenge to a series of debates 
to fully address the issues,'' Gore press secretary Kiki Moore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both campaigns have been offered more than 40 debate and forum  
opportunities,'' Moore added. ``The fact that the senator can't 
even find one acceptable debate in the next two months is an insult 
to the voters of New Hampshire and Iowa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley campaign chairman Douglas Berman said Bradley is  
sticking to his own timeline in laying out policy proposals for 
voters and will not begin debates until he's finished outlining his 
agenda.

<HEADLINE> CompUSA To Hire Black Ad Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a 10-week campaign by black consumers to  
compel CompUSA to advertise with black-oriented media, the 
president of the computer retailer is promising to hire a 
black-owned advertising agency and offer 10 percent discounts to 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell you I wish it hadn't taken so long,'' CompUSA chief  
executive Jim Halpin said today in an appearance on the syndicated 
black radio program ``The Tom Joyner Morning Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Show co-hosts Tom Joyner and Black Entertainment Television  
commentator Tavis Smiley galvanized the drive, which included 
listeners sending the company cash register receipts to graphically 
illustrate black buyers' impact on CompUSA's bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	The two said they targeted CompUSA after an advertising firm  
identified the company as one that gives short shrift to black 
media. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the campaign, CompUSA refused to publicly discuss the  
situation, but responded after scores of listeners called the 
company last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got bad advice but it wasn't intended,'' Halpin said. ``It's  
a shame this took us off track for a while. I want to sell 
computers to anyone who walks in the door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Halpin said the company never intended to neglect minority  
consumers. ``We're using urban radio. Just not to the extent we 
should be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts were under way to advertise in black and Hispanic media,  
and the company plans to enlist the help of a black-owned 
advertising firm, Halpin added. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, listeners who mailed in receipts will get a 10  
percent discount on their next purchase, Halpin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The drive came at a time when the Dallas-based retailer is  
trying to recover from a difficult year. For the quarter that ended 
June 26, the company posted a loss of $14.9 million or 16 cents a 
share. The company said in August it was laying off 1,800 
salespeople and reassigning many of those who remain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a tough year last year,'' Halpin acknowledged in  
today's broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the first time Smiley and Joyner have used the  
program to speak out about concerns of their black listeners. They 
were pivotal in the recent awarding of a Congressional Gold Medal 
to civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks and a decision to remove slave 
memorabilia from a scheduled auction at Christie's in New York.

<HEADLINE> Nissan Plan Worries Japan Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese leaders today expressed concern about a  
restructuring plan announced by Nissan Motor and its potential 
impact on the country's fledgling economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's second-largest carmaker announced plans Monday to cut  
21,000 jobs and close several plants in a restructuring effort 
generally recognized as a crucial step toward reviving the troubled 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	But Trade Minister Takashi Fukaya, while acknowledging Nissan's  
dilemma, said he wanted the company to study more ``natural'' ways 
of cutting its work force. He suggested one way would be to reduce 
the number of new hires rather than direct layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am also very worried about the affiliated subcontractors,''  
Fukaya said. ``While it is necessary for these companies to study 
ways to survive on their own, the government would like to extend 
as much help as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi expressed similar concerns during a  
regular Cabinet meeting today, according to Japanese media. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the restructuring plan drawn up with Renault, Nissan will  
cut its work force to 127,000 by the fiscal year beginning April 1, 
2002. About 16,500 jobs will be cut in Japan, 2,400 in Europe and 
1,400 in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The talk of job cuts is of particular concern to the government  
because it comes as officials had just begun to express optimism 
that Japan is finally emerging from its worst economic downturn in 
decades.

<HEADLINE> TV Stations Discuss Columbine H.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- When the three executives responsible for  
what most Americans saw on TV in the horrifying hours after the 
Columbine High School massacre share their stories, what's most 
striking is what they leave out. 
</P>
<P>
	There's little boasting, no talk about who had the best camera  
angles, whose news helicopter was first on the scene or who was 
quickest to divulge the names of the two boys who killed 13 people 
and themselves this spring in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they're more apt to talk about what didn't make the  
air. Or why a psychologist was secretly sent to speak to reporters. 
Or why three people who live to beat each other on stories actually 
met to plan coverage together when Columbine reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	The lessons that news directors of KCNC-TV, KMGH-TV and KUSA-TV  
in Denver offer today have more to do with sensitivity than speed 
in telling the story. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the most part, we sort of put the competitive situation  
behind because we all wanted to see this come out the right way,'' 
said Angie Kucharski of KCNC at a recent panel run by the Radio and 
Television News Directors Association in Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the stations covered the developing story live on April  
20, and their reports were fed to the world via cable news stations 
and broadcast networks. 
</P>
<P>
	By no means was the coverage perfect. KUSA goofed by putting on  
the air in a live feed a young man who said he was a student 
calling on a cell phone from within Columbine. He turned out to be 
an impostor, but if it had been real, it was a situation that could 
have put him or others in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	Stations aired helicopter footage of SWAT teams moving in and  
students fleeing in panic -- risky pictures if the gunmen were still 
alive and had access to television. 
</P>
<P>
	But two experts who went back and reviewed the coverage praised  
how the local stations handled it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they did a remarkably good job, considering the  
situation, considering the stress and the kind of pressure they 
were under with live television,'' said Alicia Shepard of American 
Journalism Review, who is devoting a chapter to Columbine in a 
journalism textbook she is writing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were tremendously sensitive to the culture and the  
audience,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Steele, an ethics group leader at the Poynter Institute in  
Florida, said that despite some mistakes, the coverage held up well 
compared to similar major breaking stories. The local journalists 
were appropriately aggressive and thorough, yet were respectful to 
people caught up in the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the stations held back reporting the names of victims  
and assailants, in some cases for hours, until they were confirmed 
by authorities. Some reporters who interviewed students urged them 
not to identify who they saw in school. Cameras were often left 
behind when students were approached for interviews, or they 
weren't approached at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The news directors said it was important not to fill air time  
with speculation for fear of terrifying parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The magnitude of the story forces you to take that step back  
and say, `We don't need to be wrong on this,''' Kucharski said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the first day, the news directors -- aware of community  
resentment against national reporters -- met to plan coverage for 
when Columbine students returned. The news executives also watched 
the emotional health of their employees; Diane Mulligan of KMGH-TV 
brought cookies and coffee to the scene and arranged for 
post-trauma counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question I have is what would have happened in Los Angeles  
or New York City?'' Shepard said. ``Would the same thing have 
happened or would the competitiveness have gotten in the way of 
sensitivity?'' 
</P>
<P>
	What's also striking when watching the three news directors  
discuss their coverage is that each of them -- Kucharski, Mulligan 
and Patti Ann Dennis -- is a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussing whether that has anything to do with their story  
coverage is, in itself, a sensitive issue. Kucharski's back seemed 
to stiffen when she was asked about it, as if guarding against an 
oncoming professional slight. Her decisions were in the service of 
journalism, not gender, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	To Shepard, the question is not out of line.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think that they were very solid journalistically and the  
fact that they were women may have enhanced their sensitivity,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele noted that there has been some academic research into the  
question of a masculine and feminine approach to decision-making 
and moral reasoning. Neither approach is always connected to 
gender, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that these were three women news directors may have  
had something to do with the quality of the coverage and the 
sensitivity that the stations brought to it,'' he said. ``They were 
good leaders and decision-makers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, how a television station performs when tested by a  
breaking story of this magnitude has much to do with the staff's 
experiences and grounding as journalists, and the direction set 
from the top. There's only so much that can be done in advance, 
Kucharski said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the scanner goes off,'' she said, ``I have yet to see a  
newsroom where they open up their drawers and get their binders out 
to look at a plan.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP Make Headway on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House officials and congressional budget  
writers are beginning an intensive one-week effort to resolve their 
fight over overdue spending bills without using Social Security 
surpluses to pay for new programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty days into fiscal 2000, White House budget chief Jack Lew  
was expected on Capitol Hill today to begin sorting through 
differences ranging from foreign aid to hiring teachers and buying 
park lands. 
</P>
<P>
	At an 80-minute White House meeting Tuesday evening, the two  
sides agreed to try resolving their differences in a week. If they 
haven't, White House officials say Clinton may veto the $268 
billion defense bill -- a step that could increase his leverage by 
adding it to the measures from which savings could be extracted to 
pay for increases elsewhere in the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll hopefully get this thing wound up in a reasonable  
time,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a sense of urgency about getting this done and  
getting it done by next Tuesday when the president would have to 
start vetoing bills if it's not done,'' House Minority Leader Dick 
Gephardt, D-Mo., said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, disputes have blocked the enactment of eight of the 13  
annual spending bills for fiscal 2000, now 20 days old. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told the lawmakers that today he would sign a sixth bill  
covering veterans, housing and environmental programs. But five of 
the bills either have been vetoed or face veto threats, and it is 
those measures that bargainers would focus on. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have been adding billions of dollars to those bills,  
narrowing their differences with Clinton to less than $10 billion -- 
out of a total of about $145 billion in annual spending that 
lawmakers control. The measures cover the departments of Health and 
Human Services, Labor, Education, Interior, State, Justice, 
Commerce and other agencies, plus foreign aid and the District of 
Columbia budget. 
</P>
<P>
	But arguments remain over policy -- for example, whether to give  
states more leeway over money Clinton wants to use to hire 
additional teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Republicans have made leaving Social Security  
surpluses alone a major goal of their budget fight with Clinton. 
The president has agreed, though at one point he also proposed 
using the surpluses if Republicans would agree to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Democrats have insisted that even without the  
president's spending demands, Republicans rely heavily on budget 
gimmicks and are on track to spend Social Security surpluses -- 
which Republicans deny. 
</P>
<P>
	But participants left the White House meeting saying they would  
look for non-Social Security savings to pay for extra spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their key goal is to not spend the Social Security surplus,''  
White House budget chief John Podesta said. ``We've said that we 
share that, notwithstanding the fact that we question whether their 
gimmicks and numbers add up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties have used Social Security's surpluses to cover  
spending for decades, without affecting the system's ability to pay 
benefits. The pension system trades its excess cash for Treasury 
bills, and if the cash is then spent it has no effect on Social 
Security itself. 
</P>
<P>
	But looking ahead to next year's elections, each party is eager  
to cast itself as a defender of the massive pension program for the 
elderly and disabled. And growing surpluses in the non-Social 
Security part of the budget -- along with an increased use of ideas 
like delaying some spending until fiscal 2001 -- have made it 
possible to stay away from the Social Security money. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans told reporters that Clinton also had agreed to  
abandon his effort to pay for extra spending for schools and other 
programs by raising taxes, including a 55-cent-a-pack increase in 
the federal cigarette tax. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats said that while Clinton conceded that Congress  
would not approve the full 55-cent boost, he believes a lesser 
increase remains politically viable. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a long way from 1 cent to 55 cents,'' said Senate  
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	The discussions will include proposals -- largely supported by  
both sides -- to extend expired tax breaks for corporate research 
and development and other purposes. The two sides also said they 
will discuss rolling back some reductions in Medicare 
reimbursements to hospitals and nursing homes that were enacted as 
part of the 1997 budget-balancing deal between Clinton and 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite recent sharp clashes over the Senate's rejection of a  
nuclear weapons test ban treaty and some of Clinton's judicial 
nominations, participants said the mood during the Cabinet Room 
meeting was cordial. Before getting down to business, they briefly 
discussed football and cowboy boots, which Vice President Al Gore 
was said to be wearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their differences over spending for hiring teachers,  
purchasing park lands and other issues, neither side was ready to 
let the dispute escalate into an attention-grabbing government 
shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
	With a stopgap bill keeping agencies open set to expire Thursday  
night, Congress sent Clinton a measure extending that deadline 
through Oct. 29 while lawmakers work through budget differences. 
The president was considered certain to sign it.

<HEADLINE> Citadel Sex Bias Suit To Go Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A federal judge ruled on Tuesday that The  
Citadel can be tried for sexual discrimination and five cadets can 
be tried for sexual harassment of a former female cadet. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joseph Anderson threw out about half the 34  
charges brought by former cadet Jeanie Mentavlos, and ordered that 
the cadets and the once all-male military academy should be tried 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
	Mentavlos, one of four women admitted to the state-run school in  
1996, alleges she was hazed and harassed before she dropped out 
after one semester. She claims Citadel officials violated her civil 
rights by failing to act against male upperclassmen who were 
hostile about the admission of women to the once all-male school. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said there was evidence the school may have covered up  
allegations of harassment, but did not say what that evidence was. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawes Cooke, who represents The Citadel, said Mentavlos must  
prove a continuous course of misconduct. Instead, she has presented 
``a shotgun blast of numerous types of things,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mentavlos' attorney, Dick Harpootlian, said he can prove a  
pattern of harassment based on gender that the school did nothing 
to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the cadets set fire to Mentavlos' shirt to expose her  
bra and refused to let her put out the fire. She also was permitted 
just 30 seconds to shower despite telling an upperclassman she was 
menstruating and needed to tend to personal hygiene matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Citadel cadets prey on those who are different,''  
Harpootlian said at a hearing Tuesday. ``Everything that was done 
was not because she couldn't cut it, it's because she was a 
woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cadets are set to go to trial on Nov. 12. Anderson said he  
will make a written decision on whether to toss out the remaining 
claims against the school pending the outcome of the cadets' trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Mentavlos, who graduated from Queens College in Charlotte, N.C.,  
and is teaching sixth grade, did not comment after Tuesday's 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon Faulkner became the first female cadet when she entered  
The Citadel under a court order in 1995. She dropped out after less 
than a week, citing the stress of the court fight and her isolation 
in the corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Messer, another female cadet admitted with Mentavlos in  
1996, settled her lawsuit last year for $33,750. 
</P>
<P>
	A 13-month investigation by the Justice Department supported the  
women's allegations of physical and verbal abuse, but concluded 
that many of the male cadets faced the same harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Nancy Mace became The Citadel's first female graduate.  
She entered in the fall of 1996 with Mentavlos and Messer. The 
fourth woman, Petra Lovetinska, is expected to graduate next year.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Drop Balls, Lose Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A routine throw ticked off first baseman Mike  
Stanley's mitt. A potential double-play grounder rolled to the 
wrong spot, second baseman Jose Offerman's glove. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Boston Red Sox season trickled away in a record-breaking  
display of fielding futility. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a situation where they weren't mental mistakes,'' Boston  
center fielder Darren Lewis said. ``They're just physical mistakes. 
Nobody tries to do that. They just happened at the wrong time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox might have been eliminated anyway Monday night. New  
York pitcher Orlando Hernandez was that strong. But the Yankees got 
help from Boston's weak fielding for the second straight night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox committed four errors in Sunday night's 9-2 loss and  
two in Monday night's 6-1 setback that gave the Yankees a 4-1 
victory in the best-of-7 AL Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you start giving a team three or four extra outs a game,  
it can come back to bite you and it did,'' Red Sox reliever Derek 
Lowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's 10 errors set a record for an LCS of any length. Nomar  
Garciaparra, who committed two errors on Sunday, ended the series 
one short of the ALCS record for shortstops of five errors set by 
Boston's Spike Owen in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Boston had a decent shot at a comeback in the finale  
as it trailed 2-0 through six innings. But the Red Sox had the AL's 
third worst fielding team this season and it was easy to see why in 
the seventh inning when two errors led to two runs. 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed the parka-clad fans made better use of their gloves on  
a chilly October night at windy Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	With one out in the seventh, Garciaparra cleanly fielded Derek  
Jeter's grounder. The throw was on target, but Stanley muffed it. 
Instead of two outs and no runners, Jeter was on second with one 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul O'Neill's single sent Jeter to third and a walk to Bernie  
Williams loaded the bases. Chili Davis then hit the grounder to 
Offerman. 
</P>
<P>
	Had there been two outs, he could have thrown to Stanley to end  
the inning. With only one out, he still could have ended the threat 
by throwing to Garciaparra to start a double play. But Offerman 
never caught the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter scored on that play and O'Neill scored on Tino Martinez's  
single that made it 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
	It was just one inning of ineptitude, but it was costly. Just  
like Boston's fielding problems in the ninth inning of Game 4 
allowed New York to pull away. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees led 3-2 going into that inning. But errors by  
Offerman and Lewis, one of baseball's best fielding outfielders, 
contributed to a sixth-run ninth in which pinch-hitter Ricky Ledee 
capitalized with a grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't take credit away from them for coming up with the  
big hits,'' Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees scored two other runs in the fourth when  
Garciaparra, who had a career-low 17 errors this season, and 
starting pitcher Bret Saberhagen made errors. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last two games, New York scored 13 runs but only three in  
innings in which the Red Sox made no errors. The Yankees committed 
five errors but they weren't nearly as costly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed when they made a few errors they got out of the  
situation,'' Saberhagen said. ``When we made a few errors, we 
didn't.''

<HEADLINE> Penn State Ready for Purdue's Brees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Maybe Penn State has Purdue's Drew  
Brees all figured out: Give him his astronomical passing stats -- 
just don't let his receivers dash for the end zone after the catch. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy worked for the Nittany Lions in 1998, when they  
didn't allow Brees to complete a pass for more than 19 yards on the 
way to a 31-13 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	It worked for Michigan and Ohio State this month. And it could  
work again Saturday when the No. 2 Lions (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten) visit 
the No. 16 Boilermakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did complete a lot of passes and he did have a lot of  
yards, but they were a lot of passes that didn't really contribute 
to the game. That's the big key: Shutting down the big play,'' said 
linebacker Mac Morrison, who sustained a concussion during 
Saturday's victory over Ohio State 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year we also had a great pass rush, and I think we're  
going to have to do that again,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brees finished 39-of-58 for 361 yards in that defeat at Penn  
State, but threw an interception, was sacked six times and only 
threw one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Same story this month against the Wolverines and the Buckeyes:  
Brees threw one TD in two games. Purdue lost both. 
</P>
<P>
	But the junior is coming off yet another spectacular showing,  
completing 40 passes for 506 yards and five TDs in the 
Boilermakers' (5-2, 2-2 Big Ten) 52-28 upset of No. 11 Michigan 
State Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	And Penn State's Joe Paterno thinks this is a different Purdue  
offense from the one he saw last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's better because Drew Brees is better,'' Paterno said.  
``They did not play well against Michigan ... and then they hurt 
themselves against Ohio State with a couple of bad plays. But they 
were scary against Michigan State, which is a very good defensive 
football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What with Brees' quick throws, teams have managed only five  
sacks. He has four targets averaging 50 yards a game. Chris Daniels 
had 21 catches for 301 yards Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I've seen, they have the same type of firepower,  
just more experience,'' Lions defensive end Justin Kurpeikis said. 
``They do a lot of three-step drops, get rid of the ball quickly. 
What you have to do is put pressure on and hope to get some hits on 
the quarterback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State took some hits in its 23-10 victory over No. 22 Ohio  
State. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Kevin Thompson has a separated shoulder, and Paterno  
doesn't know if he can play Saturday. Thompson was slammed by 
Buckeyes linebacker Na'il Diggs in the second quarter and did not 
return. Rashard Casey would get his first start if Thompson doesn't 
go. 
</P>
<P>
	The offensive line is also banged up, with John Blick (ankle)  
questionable and Eric Cole (shoulder) ailing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions insist they aren't worried about a letdown, similar to  
the ones they've had in the past after beating the Buckeyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think this is the type of team that's going to be flat  
after Ohio State,'' Morrison said. ``I think this Purdue team is 
better than Ohio State was, anyway, so this is a big game for us.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Says Reno Plot Has No Merit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- After spending 19 months in jail, a  
Palestinanian man suspected of plotting to kill U.S. Attorney 
General Janet Reno is one step closer to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	An immigration appeals court has found no merit to secret  
evidence implicating Hany Mahmoud Kiareldeen in such a scheme, his 
lawyers said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiareldeen remains in custody, however, pending a ruling on a  
request by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service to keep 
him behind bars while it decides whether to ask Reno to review the 
decision, the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line here is that every judge in the immigration  
service who has looked at this evidence has found that it does not 
support the charges that he is a threat to national security,'' 
said one of the lawyers, David Cole. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-0 decision Friday by a panel of the U.S. Board of  
Immigration Appeals granted Kiareldeen permanent resident status, 
Cole said. The INS has asked for a stay of that ruling until Oct. 
29 so it can consider whether to petition Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left after business hours Monday for INS  
representatives in Washington and Newark were not immediately 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiareldeen, 31, was arrested by the INS in March 1998 and  
accused of overstaying his student visa, the only charge against 
him. He has maintained his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	Summaries of secret FBI evidence given to the judge said  
Kiareldeen plotted to kill Reno because of her role in prosecuting 
the terrorists responsible for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, 
that he was a suspected member of an unnamed terrorist organization 
and that he made a threat against Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiareldeen lawyers blamed the allegations on a ``disgruntled''  
ex-wife, who testified against Kiareldeen last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's ruling upheld a decision in April by an immigration  
judge who saw the secret evidence and said it was not convincing. 
That judge said Kiareldeen should be released on $1,500 bail, but 
the INS obtained a stay from the appeals board and he stayed in 
federal custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the INS and five immigration judges have seen the evidence,  
compiled by the FBI. The use of secret evidence is permitted in 
immigration proceedings.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bishops Offer Voter Guide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The nation's Roman Catholic bishops are urging America's 60  
million Catholics to think about the rights of the poor and of 
``innocent unborn children'' before they pull the lever in the 
voting booth next year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a guide due next month in parishes throughout country, the  
bishops call on Catholics to consider voting a moral obligation. 
</P>
<P>
	The guide, ``Faithful Citizenship: Civic Responsibility for a  
New Millennium,'' includes 10 questions to help Catholics assess 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	They include ``How will we protect ... innocent, unborn  
children?'' and ``How will we address the 35,000 children dying 
every day of the consequences of hunger, debt and lack of 
development around the world?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a voting guide,'' said Cardinal Roger Mahony of  
Los Angeles. ``There are no lists of candidates.'' The document, he 
said, is intended to help Catholics ``look at issues through the 
lens that reflects our belief in God's revelation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. bishops have issued such guides during every  
presidential election year since the mid-1970s. The guides 
summarize Catholic teachings on public life and various moral 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The main topics include abortion, euthanasia and capital  
punishment. This guide is the first to focus on such contemporary 
issues as debt reduction, school violence and land mines. 
</P>
<P>
	Deal Hudson, editor of the conservative Catholic magazine  
Crisis, called the approach evenhanded, noting ``a very conscious 
attempt on the bishops' part that this document should not be 
politicized in a partisan way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Roberts, editor of the liberal Catholic weekly, National  
Catholic Reporter, agreed: ``It's an extremely valuable rundown on 
what American Catholics should be concerned about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bishops also address affordable health care, religious  
liberty, foreign aid, a more liberal immigration and refugee 
policy, and resolving regional conflicts from the Balkans to East 
Timor. They call for ratification of the nuclear test ban treaty 
and for government aid to parents who cannot afford private and 
religious schools.

<HEADLINE> Breast Feeding May Shield Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Breast-fed infants may have up to a 30 percent  
lower risk of developing some forms of childhood leukemia when 
compared to babies who are bottle-fed, according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings, to be published Wednesday in the Journal of the  
National Cancer Institute, differ from some earlier, smaller 
studies that found no statistically significant support for the 
idea that breast feeding protected against leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study, by researchers at the University of Minnesota  
Cancer Center, found that the longer babies were breast-fed, the 
more they were protected. 
</P>
<P>
	For babies breast-fed for at least one month, the leukemia risk  
was reduced by 21 percent, while the risk was reduced by up to 30 
percent for infants breast-fed for six months or longer, the study 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	The conclusions are based on interviews with 2,200 mothers whose  
children had been diagnosed with acute leukemia. Matching 
interviews were conducted with mothers of other children of similar 
age, race and geographic location. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have long known of breast feeding's health benefits in  
terms of protecting children from infection,'' said Dr. Les 
Robison, the principal researcher in the University of Minnesota 
study. ``Now we have evidence to suggest its immune-stimulating 
effects may provide another significant advantage--protection 
against cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robison acknowledged in a statement that further studies are  
needed before the conclusions can be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	His study in JNCI noted that ``other large and more detailed  
investigations'' are needed ``to eliminate the possibility that the 
findings are due to potential forms of bias or chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also noted that a 1988 German study involving 1,000 leukemia  
cases and a Dutch study this year involving 492 cases found that 
breast feeding for six months gave a ``nonsignificantly reduced 
risk of leukemia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Academy of Pediatrics has long recommended breast  
feeding as way of protecting infants from infection because breast 
milk contains substances that combat disease. A recent study also 
suggested that the nutrition in breast milk can increase the IQ of 
babies by about five percent.

<HEADLINE> Colo Springs Benefits From Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- When Terry Pierce was ready to  
retire from the Army, he didn't have to look far to find work. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce, a radar specialist, headed across the city and hired on  
with XonTech, a radar engineering company. ``When I knew these guys 
wanted me, I put in my retirement papers,'' said Pierce, a retired 
master sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Sharon, a recently retired Army master sergeant who  
specialized in journalism, doesn't expect to have a problem finding 
a job, either. ``We're sort of a high-tech family,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since 1981, I've seen the place really grow,'' Terry Pierce  
said of his adopted hometown of Colorado Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of it is attributable to the military. People get out  
and go to work for companies doing work for the military. But now 
it has developed a life of its own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pierces picked the city as their last post before retirement  
because of its bustling high-tech job market, which was spawned in 
part by a high concentration of military bases and defense 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	The city has ``the highest concentrations of high-end military  
in the nation with the possible exception of the Washington area,'' 
said Ross C. DeVol, director of regional and demographic studies 
for Milken Institute of Santa Monica, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Space Command, Space Warfare Center, North American Air  
Defense Command and other units have made Colorado Springs a magnet 
for defense contractors, and that gave it ``the critical mass of 
high-tech workers to prosper,'' said DeVol. 
</P>
<P>
	DeVol has charted the growth of high tech, also called  
information technology, the fastest-growing industry in the nation. 
Colorado Springs ranks as the 14th-fastest growing city in high 
tech industries. 
</P>
<P>
	DeVol said the city has begun ``to incubate some of its own  
companies. If you pulled the military out, Colorado Springs 
probably would retain some of it, but I would argue it wouldn't be 
there in the first place (without the military),'' said DeVol. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprawled across the prairie at the foot of Pikes Peak, Colorado  
Springs is home to four major military facilities, including a base 
that tracks military satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than five years ago, city and business leaders feared  
post-Cold War defense cutbacks would cost the area thousands of 
jobs. Instead, the government and private contractors have spent 
billions of dollars on improvements at military facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Mayor Marylou Makepeace likes to call the city ``Silicon  
Mountain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's true that it started with the military,'' she says.  
</P>
<P>
	High-tech industry accounts for 27 percent of the city's  
economy, said Tom Daschback, vice president of business and 
industrial development for the Colorado Springs Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 50 defense contractors with offices here and the  
number of other high tech employers continues to climb. 
</P>
<P>
	Oracle Corp., the world's second-largest software firm, is  
moving its technical support center to Colorado Springs. Hewlett 
Packard operates a plant in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Oracle, now with 950 employees in Colorado Springs, chose the  
city partly because it found 75 percent of its workers right here, 
said Gary Mustian, staffing specialist for the company's Rocky 
Mountain Support Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``This local area is very rich in talent,'' Mustian said.  
</P>
<P>
	Aerospace Corp., a nonprofit company that develops and tests  
satellites for the Air Force, is building a space-debris warning 
system in Colorado Springs. The Los Angeles-based company would 
take information from the Air Force, which has a base nearby, 
remove anything classified and then sell it to companies operating 
satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	There are more than 40,000 uniformed and civilian military jobs  
in the area, producing a payroll of nearly $800 million and 
accounting for 38 percent of the economy. DeVol said there are more 
than 43,000 high-tech jobs, which includes some of the military 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past some may have thought the military a problem for  
the community. Now the caliber is very high. I don't care what job 
you are talking about (in the military), it is seriously 
professional,'' said the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We love it when they bring those talents and stay.''

<HEADLINE> Nature Group Issues Climate Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Cities including New York and Tokyo may face  
flooding; large swathes of Latin America will suffer from drought 
and Australia's Great Barrier Reef may be destroyed unless more is 
done to stop global warming, the World Wildlife Fund for Nature 
warned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The environmental group urged governments meeting in Germany  
next week to honor earlier pledges to cut emissions of carbon 
dioxide -- one of the main greenhouse gases -- by implementing tough 
energy-saving policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Evidence for the warming of our planet over the last 200 years  
is now overwhelming,'' said a WWF statement. ``With no action to 
curb emissions, the climate on earth over the next century could 
become warmer than any the human species has lived through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It said China's Giant Panda and the Arctic polar bear were among  
the species at risk of extinction from global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	WWF commissioned the Climatic Research Unit at Britain's  
University of East Anglia to conduct research into various climate 
change scenarios over the next few decades. 
</P>
<P>
	It projected that sea levels would rise between three-quarters  
of an inch to four inches per decade. This would threaten low-lying 
U.S. coastal cities such as New York, Boston, Baltimore and Miami 
with flooding. The Japanese cities of Tokyo and Osaka -- among 
others -- would also be at risk, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Large areas of the Amazon would become more susceptible to  
forest fires. Drought would also likely affect Argentina, southern 
Mexico and Central America. Rising sea temperatures by 2010 
threatened the very survival of the Australian Great Barrier Reef. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists generally agree that temperatures are rising -- with  
1998 being the warmest year on record. But there is no consensus on 
how much man is to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the precise contribution of human activities to  
global warming cannot yet be stated with confidence, it is clear 
the planet would not be warming as rapidly if humans were not 
currently emitting about 6.8 billion tons of carbon into the 
atmosphere each year,'' said the WWF report. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1997 agreement reached in the Japanese city of Kyoto,  
industrialized nations agreed to reduce their carbon dioxide 
emissions by five percent between 2008 and 2012. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives from 150 countries meet later this month in Bonn  
to work on ways of implementing the Kyoto deal prior to a November 
2000 meeting in the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	While President Clinton signed the Kyoto agreement, he has not  
sought its ratification because of widespread opposition in the 
Senate. Critics say it will cost too much to implement while 
developing countries will be allowed to let greenhouse emissions 
grow.

<HEADLINE> Knee Injury Plagues Hornets' Davis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Charlotte Hornets reserve guard Ricky  
Davis, a first-round draft choice in 1998, could miss up to four 
months with torn cartilage in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury occurred in Charlotte's exhibition game at Minnesota  
on Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets said Tuesday that surgery was scheduled for  
Thursday, when the tear is to either be repaired or cut out, 
depending on the severity of the injury. The team said Davis is 
expected to be sidelined for 6-to-16 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-6 Davis was the 21st overall pick in last year's  
draft after playing just one season at Iowa. He appeared in 46 of 
the Hornets' 50 games last season, averaging 4.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was targeted for a reserve role again this season.

<HEADLINE>  Tanzanians Pay Tribute to Nyerere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) -- Politicians, close friends and  
family attended a Roman Catholic funeral Mass today for former 
President Julius Nyerere and tens of thousands of citizens gathered 
outside to pay their respects. 
</P>
<P>
	The mourners later followed the cortege to the national stadium  
in Dar es Salaam, where the man revered as Tanzania's founding 
father will lie in state until a state funeral on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	President Benjamin Mkapa and his predecessor Ali Hassan Mwinyi,  
who took office when Nyerere stepped down in 1985, were among the 
thousands of senior government and foreign dignitaries, close 
friends and family who attended the mass in St. Patrick's 
Cathedral, where Nyerere worshipped. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands more stood outside, watching the proceedings  
on video screens. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinal Polycarp Opengo, who led scores of bishops and priests  
in the service, praised Nyerere for his honesty and integrity on a 
continent where so many leaders succumb to corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Fondly known throughout Africa as ``Mwalimu,'' or teacher in the  
national language Kiswahili, Nyerere is remembered at home as the 
man who led the drive for Tanzania's independence from Britain in 
1961 and later forged a nation from the union of then Tanganyika 
and the Indian Ocean islands of Zanzibar. 
</P>
<P>
	He is credited with peacefully uniting the 120 ethnic groups in  
Tanzania under a national flag and bringing education to even the 
poorest Tanzanians during his 23 years as president. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his failed policy of socialism that impoverished this  
East African nation, many ordinary Tanzanians received news of his 
death last week as the death of a family member and the mass drew 
people from all denominations and religions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nyerere genuinely cared for the welfare of the common man like  
myself during his time in office and even after retirement,'' said 
Abedi Sulum, 50, a sculptor. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his death in a London hospital on Oct. 14, messages of  
praise have poured in from world leaders paying tribute to Nyerere, 
who championed struggles for independence across the continent. He 
led the drive to oust dictator Milton Obote from Uganda, and 
spearheaded international efforts to dismantle South Africa's 
apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
	Nyerere was suffering from leukemia after a massive stroke.  
</P>
<P>
	World figures, including Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,  
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and Britain's Princess Anne are to 
attend the state funeral on Thursday.

	Douglas, who led the team with 12 1/2 sacks last season, will have  
surgery Wednesday, agent Drew Rosenhaus said. The Eagles didn't 
remove Douglas from the 53-man roster and gave no details about the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Andy Reid said Monday that Douglas would be out for the  
year if he needed surgery. Reid wasn't available Tuesday, the 
team's day off. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a strong chance he's going to need surgery on that,''  
Reid said during his weekly press briefing. ``If he does, he'll be 
out for the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas ruptured his left biceps as he fought off a blocker  
while chasing running back Curtis Enis in the Eagles' 20-16 victory 
over Chicago on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenhaus held out hope that Douglas could return this season,  
but the Eagles (2-4) would have to keep him on the active roster. 
New England linebacker Ted Johnson had the same injury in the 
preseason and wasn't placed on injured reserve. The Patriots said 
he'd be out four months. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that was up to Hugh, I'm certain he would want to come back  
and contribute,'' Rosenhaus said. ``We do know he's a fast 
healer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas just came back from a partially torn knee ligament in  
two weeks after doctors expected him to miss six weeks. Losing him 
again is a huge blow to the Eagles' defense, which leads the NFL 
with 17 forced turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very frustrating, because I only got to play about two  
games and then this happens,'' said Douglas, who does not want to 
play at less than full strength. ``I'm not the biggest defensive 
lineman to begin with. To play at half my strength, that wouldn't 
be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles are prepared to go with a rotation including Mike  
Mamula, Brandon Whiting and Ike Reese to replace Douglas.

<HEADLINE> Three Cos. in Belgium Steel Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The steelmaker Arbed SA of Luxembourg  
said today its Belgian unit ALZ has formed a joint venture with 
Germany's Stahlwerke Bremen and Italy's Group Marcegaglia Spa to 
produce hot-rolled steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Stahlwerke Bremen will contribute its hot-rolling mill to the  
joint venture, in which ALZ will have a 10 percent to 15 percent 
stake and Marcegaglia 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The hot-rolled steel production unit has capacity of about 4  
million metric tons a year, and the new partners hope to boost the 
plant's capacity to 5 million tons. A metric ton is about 2,205 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	ALZ hopes to increase the production of stainless steel slabs.  
In the past, the plant produced 300,000 tons of stainless steel for 
ALZ. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcegaglia plans to use the plant to obtain up to 500,000 tons  
of hot-rolled coils a year for its cold-rolling mill and pipeworks.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Jump 0.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices jumped 0.4 percent, the  
biggest increase in five months, as energy and tobacco costs rose 
sharply. But outside of a few troublesome areas, prices remained 
generally well-behaved in September, the government reported 
Tuesday, helping spur a relief rally on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said September's increase in the Consumer  
Price Index was the biggest price surge since a 0.7 percent rise in 
April. But much of the increase reflected rising energy prices and 
another big jump in tobacco prices pushed through to pay for court 
settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding energy and food, the core rate of inflation is up just  
2 percent over the past 12 months, which Clinton administration 
chief economist Martin Baily noted is the best showing in more than 
three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no widespread inflationary pressure, even as our  
economy grows and employment remains strong,'' Baily said. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report, the Commerce Department said that housing  
construction tumbled 3.2 percent in September, the second 
consecutive monthly decline, as housing felt the pinch of rising 
mortgage rates and Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street, which has been buffeted on fears of rising  
inflation, staged a relief rally Tuesday, with the Dow Jones 
industrial average up 100 points in late afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks suffered their worst week in a decade last week, as  
inflation worries increased. The government reported Friday that 
wholesale prices jumped 1.1 percent in August, the biggest gain in 
nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	Many private economists said Tuesday's economic reports showed  
that overall inflation is still under control while 
interest-sensitive sectors such as housing are beginning to slow to 
a more sustainable pace just as the Fed desired when it pushed 
interest rates up in June and August. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many analysts looked for the central bank to raise rates  
for a third time when policy-makers meet on Nov. 16 because the 
economy continues to grow more rapidly than the Fed would like, 
given how tight labor markets are at present. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still think the Fed will tighten in November,'' said First  
Union economist Mark Vitner. ``Their motivation is curbing 
excessive demand growth, not combating a sudden burst of 
inflation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, consumer prices have been rising at an annual  
rate of 2.8 percent. While that is sharply higher than last year's 
1.6 percent increase, which had been the slowest pace in 12 years, 
all of the acceleration has come from a rebound in energy prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher inflation will mean a bigger cost-of-living increase  
for the 44.2 million Americans getting Social Security checks. The 
government announced Tuesday their benefits will rise by 2.4 
percent starting in January, nearly double the 1.3 percent increase 
they received this year. That will mean an average increase of $19 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline in housing in September pushed starts down to an  
annual rate of 1.62 million single-family homes and apartments, 
still a high level that keeps the industry on track for a strong 
year even though mortgage rates are up more than a full percentage 
point since January. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, housing construction was down in all parts of the  
country except the Midwest, with declines of 3.2 percent in the 
South and 25.7 percent in the Northeast blamed in part on the 
impact of Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy prices jumped 2.7 percent in September, the third  
straight big monthly gain. Gasoline prices climbed 2.6 percent last 
month while home heating oil shot up 6.2 percent, the biggest 
increase in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Through September, energy costs are rising at an annual rate of  
16.1 percent after having fallen 8.8 percent in 1998 as American 
consumers benefited from a worldwide glut of crude oil caused by 
steep recessions in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Food costs rose a modest 0.2 percent in September as a big drop  
in fruit prices helped offset increases for dairy products, beef 
and pork. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco prices shot up 6.5 percent, the biggest increase since  
last December, as the industry continues to increase prices to 
cover court settlement costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clothing prices, which had fallen for four straight months, were  
up 1.2 percent in September, reflecting higher prices on new fall 
lines. But airline fares dropped a sharp 1.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Arizona Wildcats Climbing Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Despite all that's gone wrong, Arizona  
finds itself in the thick of the Pac-10 football race. The Wildcats 
(5-2) have the best overall record of any team in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	If Pac-10 leader Stanford stumbles, Arizona could find itself  
with its first Rose Bowl berth in the school's history. Such a goal 
seemed far out of reach after the Wildcats opened their season by 
being routed 41-7 by Penn State, then lost their Pac-10 opener at 
home, 50-22, to Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Arizona has won three straight, including two  
conference games. None of the wins was all that impressive, but in 
the down-and-out Pac-10, with no team ranked in the Top 25, it's 
enough to move Arizona back into a contender's role. 
</P>
<P>
	While Stanford leads the league at 4-0, four teams are 2-1 --  
Arizona, Arizona State, California and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford has consecutive road games the next three weeks against  
Southern California, Washington and Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got a tough, tough road coming up,'' Arizona coach  
Dick Tomey said Tuesday. ``If they can go through that, then more 
power to them. But I would suspect that all of the bullets have not 
been shot at this point. I think it's going to get crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In order to stay in contention, the Wildcats probably can't  
afford another loss. Arizona is home against Oregon on Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most important game I've ever played,'' Wildcats  
center Bruce Wiggins said. ``If we're talking about going to the 
Rose Bowl, we need to win this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As well as the following games against UCLA, Washington, Oregon  
State and Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomey said his team's performance in its last Pac-10 game, a  
31-24 victory over USC two weeks ago, won't be good enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I said to them the other day, if we play like we did  
against USC we'll probably be about 2-3 in our last five,'' Tomey 
said. ``We need to play better, because you have to assume that 
everybody is going to get better. If we're not getting better, 
we're not competitive. The focus is on making an enormous 
improvement this week. The team that wins this whole thing will be 
the team that improves the most from today to the end of the 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Improved play from the offensive line has helped Arizona finally  
get its running game in gear. The Wildcats rushed for 396 yards in 
last week's 34-21 nonconference victory over UTEP, its highest 
total since 1981. Trung Canidate was named Pac-10 offensive player 
of the week after rushing for 202 yards in 27 carries, including a 
60-yard touchdown run. It was the eighth time in his career that 
he's had a scoring run of 60 yards or more. 
</P>
<P>
	The improved ground game has helped all aspects of the team's  
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're out there running the ball, the defensive line is  
sitting down drinking water and getting some rest,'' Wiggins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomey wasn't tipping his hand on who would get the most playing  
time at quarterback. Keith Smith, who had edged out Ortege Jenkins 
going into last week, went out with bruised ribs on the fifth play 
of the UTEP game. Jenkins rallied the team from a 14-0 deficit. He 
had a 52-yard run to set up one touchdown and was 10-of-17 for 113 
yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll just see what happens this week,'' Tomey said. ``We have  
all the options in the world, and we'd just like to keep it that 
way. That's not the biggest decision we have.''

<HEADLINE> Reynolds Report $45M 3Q Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Reynolds Metals Co. reported its  
third-quarter profit fell 26 percent as aluminum shipments 
declined, but the results beat the expectations of Wall Street 
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 3 aluminum maker said its earnings from operations,  
which exclude charges and other one-time items, came to $45 
million, or 71 cents per share, and compared with $61 million, or 
89 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat Wall Street analysts' expectations of 68 cents  
per share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	When one-time items are included, Reynolds had net income of $36  
million, or 56 cents per share, compared with $202 million, or 
$2.92 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest quarter, the company had $9 million in merger  
costs, while in the year-earlier period, Reynolds had a gain of 
$201 million, primarily from the sale of Reynolds North American 
can business to Ball Corp., and a loss of $60 million, for the 
early repayment of debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the just-ended quarter totaled $1.21 billion,  
compared to $1.37 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported its aluminum shipments fell 5 percent in  
terms of tons. But chairman and CEO Jeremiah J. Sheehan said 
increased volume and lower costs in some units mitigated 
disappointing results, including those from the transportation 
unit, which lost $15 million in the latest quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Base Materials Division was the company's biggest  
moneymaker, with income rising to $78 million from $65 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds, the No. 3 aluminum maker, is in the process of being  
acquired by No. 1 Alcoa of Pittsburgh. The deal would create a 
company with about $21 billion in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, Reynolds had income from operations  
of $61 million, or 95 cents per share, compared with $111 million, 
or $1.55 per share, in the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported year-to-date net income of $70 million, or  
$1.10 per share, compared to $192 million, or $2.69 per share, in 
the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue came to $3.44 billion, compared to $4.48 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds shares fell 37 1/2 cents to $60.56 1/4 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Mannesmann Interested in Orange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- Germany's Mannesmann AG is  
discussing a possible purchase of the British mobile telephone 
company Orange PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after France Telecom bid for Germany's E-Plus mobile phone  
operator, Mannesmann said today it is in talks with Orange's 
largest shareholder, Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa, that could lead 
to a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Mannesmann would not comment, however, on how much it was  
offering. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal Europe, citing unidentified sources,  
reported today the bid was about $26.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Mannesmann, Germany's second-largest telecoms operator, had  
expressed interest in expanding into Britain after rival Deutsche 
Telekom announced in August it was buying One2One for $11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	One2One is the smallest of Britain's four mobile phone  
companies, and Orange is the third-largest. 
</P>
<P>
	Mannesmann stock dropped more than 3 percent in early trading  
today on the news. Traders said the reported price of the bid -- 
twice what Deutsche Telekom paid for One2One -- had scared 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in Orange rallied in London, up about 10 percent from the  
opening bell. 
</P>
<P>
	The liberalization of Europe's telecommuinications market has  
sparked a spate of cross-border competition. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, France Telecom announced plans to buy a majority  
stake in E-Plus, Germany's third-largest mobile phone network, for 
$7.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Deutsche Telekom's chief for western Europe, Paul Grosse,  
said a deal to increase Telekom's presence in France is expected 
``very shortly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom have been feuding since  
their plan to form a global partnership was dealt a severe blow in 
May when the German company pursued an ill-fated attempt to merge 
with Telecom Italia.

<HEADLINE> GOP, Clinton Battle Over Nukes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP)-- Congressional Republicans are threatening to  
take the government's nuclear weapons programs out of the Energy 
Department if the Clinton administration undermines creation of a 
partially autonomous nuclear agency within the department. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson was expected to face sharp  
questioning today from senators who charge that the administration 
is sidestepping a law enacted earlier this month that creates the 
new internal DOE agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute over the new National Nuclear Security  
Administration has the Clinton administration locked in a bitter 
dispute with Republican lawmakers over the future management of 
nuclear weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans argue that security at the labs won't  
be improved until the nuclear weapons programs, including the labs, 
are put under a new agency that is insulated from the rest of the 
Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, senior administration officials are miffed that those  
same Republican lawmakers refused to provide $35 million that 
Richardson had wanted to beef up computer security at the weapons 
labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress also refused to give Richardson money he had sought to  
improve the monitoring of foreign visitors to the weapons labs. 
This, they complain, after GOP lawmakers were the loudest in 
complaining about lax computer security and how visitors posed a 
potential espionage threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted better security but won't give me the tools,''  
Richardson said angrily, referring to the budget shortfall during a 
recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's the administration's response to the creation of a new  
agency within the DOE to insulate nuclear weapons programs that has 
prompted the loudest GOP criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Creating the agency was Congress' most significant response to  
the charges of alleged spying and security lapses at the nuclear 
weapons labs. Many lawmakers thought the agency was badly needed to 
bring greater accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton signed the measure on Oct. 5, Sen. Pete Dominic  
R-N.M., said it ushers in ``a new era where security and 
accountability are the rule, not turf-squabbles and 
finger-pointing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton had no choice to sign the popular defense  
authorization bill, which contained pay raises and spending 
increases for the military, the president said he was troubled by 
the DOE reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson insists he is not opposed to a new semiautonomous  
nuclear agency. But he argued that Congress gave too much 
independence to the agency, made it unaccountable to other DOE 
offices responsible for environmental, health and security matters, 
and blocked the secretary from deciding how agency money was spent 
or what personnel were hired. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that stunned GOP lawmakers, Clinton ordered Richardson  
to assume the job as head of the new agency, and then directed that 
Richardson fill key jobs, such as counterintelligence, 
environmental and health protection and security posts, by 
officials already holding those posts within the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an absolute frontal attack on Congress,'' complained  
Domenici at a recent Armed Service Committee hearing where 
Richardson was testifying. 
</P>
<P>
	When Richardson said the president directed him to follow the  
law, and that he would do so, Domenici called the explanation 
``pious'' and cut the secretary off. ``I don't want any comments 
from you. I'm fed up,'' Domenici snapped and then left the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of the House Armed Services  
Committee, warned that ``continuing to engage in this battle'' 
would prompt Congress to take the nuclear programs entirely out of 
the Energy Department. He said creation of an independent agency 
like NASA to manage America's nuclear warheads and do weapons 
research ``already has substantial support'' especially in the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republicans talked of retaliating by withholding funds for  
DOE senior staff or department programs, but administration 
officials noted that Congress already has passed the Energy 
Department's key spending bills for fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson was to appear today before a joint hearing of the  
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Governmental 
Affairs Committee.

<HEADLINE> ABC, Disney Settling Radio Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Faced with threats of a national boycott, the  
Walt Disney Co. and ABC are trying to smooth over a flap about a 
radio promotion that offended several groups and triggered two 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of disc jockeys for ABC's KLOS-FM distributed gardening  
tools called ``Black Hoes'' as gag prizes to listeners last year. 
``Ho'' is a derogatory term for a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC at first balked at demands to apologize for the promotion.  
In August, however, the company apologized after black groups asked 
the Federal Communications Commission to revoke the Los Angeles 
station's license and threatened to boycott Disney, which owns ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC Chairman Robert Iger met three weeks ago with civil rights  
leaders at the Los Angeles headquarters of the Congress of Racial 
Equality. On Monday, ABC executives met at CORE headquarters to 
talk with civil rights leaders about the company's diversity and 
sensitivity training programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agreed to start a dialogue,'' ABC spokeswoman Julie Hoover  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLOS promotion was broadcast nationwide on the syndicated  
``Mark &AMP; Brian Show.'' Two black KLOS employees later sued ABC, 
claiming they were harassed by managers and co-workers after 
complaining about it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anti-Defamation League has been filing complaints for 10  
years about the way Mark Thompson and Brian Phelps of the ``Mark &AMP; 
Brian Show'' portray racial and ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hoover said the men will stay on the air.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Says Environment a Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley  
challenged his rival Tuesday night by telling environmentalists 
that he hopes to lead an administration that actually cleans up the 
atmosphere rather than one that talks about doing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm betting that the American public is prepared for some  
straight talk about the challenges that we face, whether it's why 
there's a legitimate public interest in building cleaner cars, or 
cleaning up the older, dirtier power plants that have gone 
unregulated,'' Bradley said at a Manhattan dinner for the League of 
Conservation Voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's time to be prudent and stop talking about taking  
tons (of pollution) out of the atmosphere, and start actually 
taking tons out of the atmosphere,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks won the former U.S. senator from New Jersey strong  
applause. And although the league ordinarily does not endorse a 
presidential candidate during the primaries, its members are 
considering doing so next year because both Bradley and Vice 
President Al Gore are viewed as friends of the environmental 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, a former senator who wrote ``Earth in the Balance,'' a  
book about ecology that earned him a reputation as a strong 
environmentalist, actually lags behind Bradley on the League of 
Conservation Voters' lifetime score card. 
</P>
<P>
	When considering the percentage of time each candidate voted  
with environmentalists on critical issues, league spokeswoman Lisa 
Ward said Gore supported their causes 65 percent of the time during 
his tenure in the House and Senate, while Bradley was on their side 
84 percent of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``That shows a very strong commitment,'' Ms. Ward said. ``That's  
what makes it tough right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the league would wait until Gore and Bradley announce  
more detailed environmental agendas before deciding whether to make 
an endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone message left with the Gore campaign late Tuesday was  
not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to targeting air pollution, Bradley said he supports  
protecting fragile coastal areas and finding a way to help poorer 
countries preserve the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he believes an environmental leader has three jobs: to  
clean up contaminated areas, to prevent pollution of pristine 
wilderness and to think globally. 
</P>
<P>
	``A leader today should think about the planet as a whole, and  
how we can set international standards and how we can help other 
countries who don't have the resources to clean up their 
environments,'' Bradley said.

<HEADLINE> United Technologies Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- United Technologies Corp. said its  
third-quarter earnings rose 25 percent on increased profits in all 
its manufacturing operations. 
</P>
<P>
	UTC reported today it had income of $436 million, or 83 cents  
per share, before a restructuring charge and costs, compared to 
earnings of $348 million, or 70 cents per share, in the third 
quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	When the after-tax charge of $346 million for the restructuring  
is included, net income totaled $90 million, or 16 cents per share, 
the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were 2 cents over the expectations of Wall Street  
analysts, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Investors bid 
UTC's stock up $1.94 to $54.25 in midday New York Stock Exchange 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said revenues totaled $6.1 billion, up 7 percent  
from sales of $5.7 billion in the same quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	UTC said it expected the restructuring charges to be largely  
offset by the $650 million, after-tax gain on the sale of its 
automotive unit earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	UTC chairman George David has told investors the company will  
eliminate 14,500 jobs worldwide over the next three years because 
of a downturn in the aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's Pratt &AMP; Whitney jet engines division and Sikorsky  
helicopter division have both announced major realignments of work 
among plants and will move thousands of both white- and blue-collar 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	David said in a news release Tuesday that the company's  
performance remains strong despite the slump in the aerospace and 
defense industries and economic problems in Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profit at the company's Carrier heating and air  
conditioning unit rose 18 percent to $223 million, Otis elevator's 
operating profit rose 20.4 percent to $177 million in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt &AMP; Whitney's operating profit was $261 million, up 12.5  
percent, while its flight businesses' operating profit nearly 
doubled to $132 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of this year, UTC reported net income  
of $1.5 billion, or $2.92 per share, up 55 percent from earnings of 
$968 million, or $1.94 per share, in the first nine months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month revenues for 1999 totaled $17.6 billion, up 5 percent  
from $16.8 billion in the same period in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Rocker Unhurt in Car Wreck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta reliever John Rocker was involved in a  
traffic accident that totaled his 1998 Chevrolet Corvette, but he 
was uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker said he swerved to miss a truck while driving on one of  
Atlanta's busiest highways when he hit another car Monday, an off 
day in the NLCS. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Rocker nor the driver of the other car was hurt.  
</P>
<P>
	No one was charged in the crash, which occurred the day after  
the Braves lost Game 5 to the New York Mets in the longest 
postseason game in baseball history. Game 6 was scheduled for 
Tuesday night in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-handed closer has made headlines throughout the series,  
calling New York fans ``stupid,'' and ``a tired act,'' before the 
Braves arrived in New York. That made him a target of Mets fans in 
the three games played at Shea Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Georgia native came into the dugout after striking out  
Mike Piazza to end the 13th inning on Sunday, nearby fans heckled 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just struck out your best hitter,'' he said, yelling back.  
</P>
<P>
	He stayed in the game and retired Robin Ventura leading off the  
14th, gesturing that the fly ball didn't scare him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say the majority of Mets fans aren't even human,''  
Rocker said. ``I've said how brutal the fans were and how 
disgusting they were. They were worse than I ever suspected.''

<HEADLINE> Rockies, Bell Discuss Opening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Buddy Bell probably will be offered the Colorado  
Rockies' managing job today and an announcement could come 
Wednesday, the Rocky Mountain News and The Denver Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies confirmed that Bell was at the team's offices and  
speaking with the owners and general manager Dan O'Dowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time, that's as far as it's gone,'' team spokesman Jay  
Alves said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, the former manager of the Detroit Tigers, would replace  
Jim Leyland, who retired after the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, the No. 1 candidate on O'Dowd's list, met with team owners  
and executives Monday at Coors Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very impressed,'' Bell said. ``I'm anxious to get into  
specifics. Today was just kind of getting acquainted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell has two years left on an annual $550,000 contract with  
Detroit, where he managed from 1996 to 1998. Bell played for the 
Cincinnati Reds and is their minor league director. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies want Bell to move to Denver. They don't want a  
repeat of last season in which Leyland lived in the clubhouse and 
kept his home in another state. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said he and his wife grew up in Cincinnati, ``but you've  
got to move sometime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other candidates for the Rockies' job include New York Yankees  
coach Willie Randolph, Arizona Diamondbacks coach Carlos Tosca, 
coach Ken Griffey Sr. of the Reds and Florida Marlins minor league 
manager Lynn Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell would be the third manager in the team's seven-year  
history. The Rockies hired Leyland last winter in hopes he would 
turn around a team that finished 77-85 in 1998. He won a World 
Series with the Florida Marlins in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Rockies finished in last place this season for the first  
time in franchise history. Leyland said in September he would not 
return for the final two years of a three-year, $6 million 
contract. Leyland replaced Don Baylor, the Rockies' first manager.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Verdict To Be Issued Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first phase of the judge's verdict in the  
Microsoft Corp. antitrust trial will be issued on an upcoming 
Friday evening, court officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But they didn't indicate which Friday, suggesting a decision  
might still not be announced for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said  
his factual findings will be issued at 6:30 p.m. on a Friday, 
adding that lawyers in the case will be notified two hours earlier 
that a decision is ready. 
</P>
<P>
	But even lawyers won't know the outcome until it's publicly  
disclosed that evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing suggests that the judge may be concerned about the  
impact of his ruling on the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the trial, Jackson commented that America Online  
Inc.'s $10 billion purchase of the former Netscape Communications 
Corp. was possibly a ``very significant change in the playing 
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within minutes of the judge's remarks, Microsoft's stock jumped  
sharply as investors interpreted them as favorable toward the 
company in the trial's outcome.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Real Closes Below 2.00 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's currency, the real, slid  
below the psychologically important 2.00 to the dollar mark closing 
at its lowest point in six months Tuesday, fueled by fears of an 
interest rate hike in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	The real closed at 2.0020 per dollar just below Monday's close  
of 1.9980. Tuesday marked the first time since March 4 the local 
currency closed above 2.00 to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The real dipped below 2.00 shortly after opening, but then  
bounced back after the release of U.S. consumer price index data 
for September, which came in within market expectations at 0.4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is really nervous,'' said one Rio de Janeiro based  
trader. ``The Dow (Jones industrial average) was up, the consumer 
price index was nothing to get excited about, but we still saw a 
selloff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the positive news was not enough to dispel  
continuing fears that the U.S. Federal Reserve's Open Market 
Committee will raise U.S. interest rates when it meets Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Others said several banks were aggressively speculating against  
the real. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than intervene directly by selling dollars, Brazil's  
Central bank auctioned off 500 million reals in dollar-linked 
notes, something they have done in the past to dampen the demand 
for dollars, but on Tuesday it did little to stabilize the ailing 
real. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil let it's currency float in January after instability in  
Asia and Russia forced the country to abandon its fixed-exchange 
rate. At the time, authorities said they expected the real to trade 
near 1.70 to the dollar by the end of the year, a figure that now 
seems overly optimistic.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP Set To Meet on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House set a combative tone for  
budget talks with Republicans, telling GOP congressional leaders to 
``put aside their talking points and their attack ads'' when they 
meet with President Clinton this evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, meanwhile, said they would put Clinton on notice  
that they will not raise taxes or use Social Security surpluses to 
pay for the extra spending that the president wants. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton hoped to  
reach a ``framework'' for a wider budget agreement but ``has no 
particular mechanism in mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides are meeting nearly three weeks into the new fiscal  
year with only five of the 13 annual spending bills approved. Five 
others have either been vetoed or face veto threats over issues 
including hiring teachers and police officers and blocking tougher 
environmental requirements for some oil and mining companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president hopes to find a way to get to agreement where we  
can maintain our fiscal discipline and our priorities,'' Lockhart 
told reporters. ``I think he hopes Republicans can put aside their 
talking points and their attack ads, come down and be honest and 
straightforward and work through these problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But with neither party ready to go to the brink, Congress  
planned as early as today to approve an eight-day extension of the 
temporary measure that has kept federal agencies open since fiscal 
2000 started on Oct. 1. The first stopgap bill expires Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to reach out a hand of friendship and hope that  
we can work together,'' Clinton said Monday night in Newark, N.J., 
where he attended a Democratic fund-raising event. 
</P>
<P>
	That hand is being extended as relations between the White House  
and Congress, already soured by Clinton's impeachment trial, have 
worsened. Last week's Senate rejection of the nuclear test ban 
treaty, a top administration foreign policy goal, has sparked 
bitter accusations of partisanship from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand about public discourse in this town. Sometimes it  
gets colorful,'' acknowledged Armey, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget  
office, the White House says even without meeting all of Clinton's 
budget demands, GOP spending plans would spend billions in Social 
Security surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's budget wouldn't spend the Social Security  
surplus,'' said White House budget director Jack Lew. ``Congress 
has said they want to do the same thing. We don't believe they 
have. We need to work out our differences in a fiscally responsible 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed paying for additional spending by raising  
tobacco taxes, levies charged industry to cover toxic waste 
cleanups and other revenues -- proposals Republicans have turned 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their differences, the two sides' differences pale  
compared with the clashes of 1995 and 1996, when GOP efforts to 
abolish entire agencies like the Education Department helped prompt 
two federal shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the five bills in the center of this year's spending fight,  
Clinton wants less than $10 billion over what Republicans have 
offered, a tiny portion of the nearly $600 billion that the annual 
spending bills control. 
</P>
<P>
	And in recent weeks, Republicans have added billions of dollars  
to move closer to Clinton's proposals. Those bills cover the 
departments of Interior, Commerce, Justice, State, Labor, 
Education, Health and Human Services, and foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	But the two sides have philosophical differences, such as how  
extensive state control over federal education aid should be. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Clinton vetoed a $12.7 billion foreign aid bill that  
fell $2 billion below his request. It omitted any of the $500 
million he wants for Israel and the Palestinians to implement the 
accord they struck last year at Wye River, Md. It also provided 
less than he wanted for international debt relief and efforts to 
reduce the nuclear threat from Russia, North Korea and other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Though both sides stood to gain by holding a meeting that would  
let them appear reasonable, it was unclear what the session would 
achieve. There were some hopes on both sides that it would lead to 
a series of lower-level meetings where remaining differences could 
be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, House and Senate Republicans agreed Monday to a  
compromise $37 billion measure financing the Commerce, Justice and 
State departments. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans added about $1.5 billion to it, but Democrats said  
Clinton would probably veto it anyway. It still contains about $2 
billion less than he wants, including less than half his $1.3 
billion request for hiring local police officers.

	NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) -- A police officer fired for allegedly  
chasing a former girlfriend down the street in his cruiser with the 
emergency lights flashing and siren blaring got his job back after 
an appeal.

he did not ``use his authority as a police officer to force a

	Chor was fired in January after he confronted an ex-girlfriend  
at a hospital where she worked as a nurse. After a conversation 
about money he owed her, he chased her car for more than half a

<HEADLINE> George Brett Contacted by Indians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- George Brett is getting a lot of  
attention for managerial vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett told The Kansas City Star he was contacted last week by  
former Kansas City Royals teammate Buddy Black, now an assistant to 
Cleveland Indians general manager John Hart. The Indians fired 
manager Mike Hargrove on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The call from Cleveland came about the same time as Brett's  
conversation last week with the Colorado Rockies, who fired Don 
Baylor and now appear to favor Buddy Bell as a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett, a 1999 Hall of Fame inductee and Kansas City Royals vice  
president, hasn't given details of either conversation and said he 
hasn't discussed the Cleveland possibility with his wife, Leslie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what's going on,'' he said. ``I'm overwhelmed by  
all the attention all of a sudden.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he believes he knows why clubs might be interested in him.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I played, I played hard and I wouldn't tolerate a lack of  
effort,'' he said. ``There is a lack of effort in some places, and 
I think they know I wouldn't tolerate that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indians batting coach Charlie Manuel is considered the leading  
candidate for the Cleveland job. Others mentioned include Davey 
Lopes, Chris Chambliss, Willie Randolph, Don Baylor and Ted 
Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians have said Hargrove's successor need not have  
managerial experience. Brett has none, and realizes he would have 
to rely on experienced coaches on his staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I ever did that, obviously, I'd have to have a lot of  
help,'' he said. ``But whatever city I'd be in, they know I'd give 
it 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett played his entire career with the Royals but has not ruled  
out leaving the club.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Among the celebrities out for Game 6 of the  
National League championship series was comic Jerry Seinfeld, seen 
chatting with New York Mets pitcher John Franco during batting 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	After failing to sell out Games 1 and 2 of the series against  
the New York Mets at Turner Field, Atlanta Braves fans finally came 
out Tuesday night for the potential clincher. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was a sellout, but maybe it was helped by Seinfeld and  
other Mets fans, who had watched their team lose the first three 
games of the best-of-7 series before winning Games 4 and 5 at Shea 
Stadium in front of sellout crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	With reasonable fares, the airlines reported flights from the  
New York area to Atlanta Tuesday were filled with Mets fans. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them was Efren Coello, 35, from just across the river in  
Closer, N.J., who had been to all three games in New York and has 
tickets for Game 7, too, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Coello was positive there would be a Game 7.  
</P>
<P>
	``I came because I know they can do it. I wouldn't have come  
otherwise,'' the retailer said as he stood behind the Mets dugout 
two hours before the game alongside several hundred other Mets 
fanatics, holding banners and hand-made signs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's Go Mets,'' he chanted along with the others.  
</P>
<P>
	``We Love Piazza,'' read one sign. ``Ya Gotta Believe,'' and  
``Nuttin' Like Da N.Y. Fans!'' were among the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantans weren't as enthusiastic for Games 1 and 2 -- 44,172  
came out for the first game and 44,624 for Game 2, both Braves 
victories at the stadium which seats more than 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 9,000 seats available before the Mets won Game 5, 4-3  
in 15 innings, but the remaining seats were gobbled up by Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FIGHTING METS:* The Mets were down 0-3, now its 2-3, and with  
the momentum changed, one Mets beat writer even wrote ``The Mets 
now lead the best-of-7 series, two victories to three. Sounds 
far-fetched. But you had to be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was referring to the lengthy Game 5 victory by the Mets.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know we were down 0-3, but we fought back,'' said Rick Reed,  
who will pitch Game 7, if there is one, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fought back and we've got a chance. We've had our backs  
against the wall for so long, I guess we're getting used to it,'' 
Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets had to sweep the last four games of the regular season  
just to make it into a wild-card playoff, then beat Cincinnati in 
that one game, before winning the division series 3-1 against 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is fun compared to those last three regular season games  
against Pittsburgh,'' Reed said. ``That was pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DEFICIT 0-3:* No team in the postseason has ever come back from  
a 3-0 deficit to win the series. In all of the seven-game series in 
baseball, the NBA and NHL, only two teams have ever come from that 
far back: the 1975 New York Islanders beat Pittsburgh in the 
Stanley Cup quarterfinals and the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs won four 
straight over Detroit to win the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what Mets reliever John Franco is counting on.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is impossible. We'll just fight and scratch and claw  
and see what happens. There's always a first time for something,'' 
he said. ``We'll just keep doing what we've been doing. The last 
week of the season, just when everybody counted us out, we found a 
way to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GAME 7:* If there is a Game 7 on Wednesday night, the pitchers  
will be Rick Reed for the Mets against Atlanta's Tom Glavine. Reed 
was the starter in Game 4 on Saturday. He went seven innings and 
didn't get the decision, giving up two runs -- home runs to Brian 
Jordan and Ryan Klesko -- but the Mets won 3-2, scoring twice in the 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine was the 1-0 winner in Game 3. He went seven innings,  
gave up seven hits and struck out eight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to approach it just like it's a regular season game,  
just as I did Game 4,'' Reed said. ``It's what you work so hard for 
in the offseason and in spring training, to get in this situation. 
It's a dream come true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine is hoping the Braves wrap it up Tuesday night.  
</P>
<P>
	``You're in an awkward situation, hoping you win Game 6 and  
don't have to go to Game 7, so I'm going to be rooting like heck 
that we win so I don't have to pitch. But if we don't win, I'll be 
ready,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Jose Threatens Caribbean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POINTE-A-PITRE, Guadeloupe (AP) -- Hurricane Jose, the 10th named  
storm of a relentless hurricane season, was on a collision course 
today with the line of islands that make up the Eastern Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's getting stronger, and it looks like it's going to go  
through a lot of islands,'' said Krissy Williams, a meteorologist 
at the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents on the French island of Martinique began stockpiling  
water and food while Red Cross officials went on alert in Puerto 
Rico, where the storm could strike Thursday. Forecasters said it 
was too early to say whether Jose might threaten the U.S. East 
Coast. At 11 a.m. EDT, Jose was about 200 miles east-southeast of 
the island of Dominica. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pointe-a-Pitre, the capital of French Guadeloupe, residents  
lined up at supermarkets before 8 a.m. and some stores ran out of 
bottled water and rice by midmorning. The island has not been hit 
by a hurricane since Hugo 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``My parents lost their roof in Hugo because they didn't take  
the warning seriously -- I'm going to prepare myself for all 
eventualities,'' said a young man buying nails in a hardware store. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose's winds strengthened to 75 mph today and it was moving  
west-northwest at 13 mph. Hurricane-force winds of 74 mph or more 
extended 25 miles to the northeast of the center. Tropical storm 
force winds stretched another 115 miles, mainly to the northeast 
and east. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane warnings were in effect for Dominica, Montserrat,  
Antigua, Barbuda, Nevis, St. Kitts, St. Eustatius, Saba, St. 
Maarten and Anguilla. France issued hurricane watches for 
Martinique, Guadeloupe, St. Martin and St. Barthelemy.

<HEADLINE> GOP Kills Campaign Finance Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to overhaul the nation's campaign  
finance laws fell to a Republican filibuster for the fourth 
straight year on Tuesday, despite concessions by supporters 
designed to build fresh momentum for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will persevere,'' vowed Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., whose  
call to reduce the role of money in campaigns is a cornerstone of 
his bid for the GOP presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate did the country a favor'' by keeping the bill  
bottled up, countered Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who contends the 
measure's ban on unlimited ``soft money'' contributions would 
violate the constitutional's free speech protections. Soft money 
contributions are unlimited donations that unions, corporations and 
some individuals give to the Republican and Democratic parties. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's fate was sealed when the Senate twice fell short of  
the 60-vote majority needed to overcome the filibuster. All 45 
Senate Democrats supported both efforts to free the measure, joined 
by a shifting group of Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after the second vote, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott  
sought to remove the bill from Senate debate. ``It's dead for the 
year,'' the Mississippi Republican later told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats objected to Lott's decision to terminate debate on the  
bill, and McCain said he would look for opportunities in unrelated 
legislation to demand a vote on a soft money ban before year's end. 
Still, Lott appeared certain to prevail when the roll was called 
Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again, a minority in the Senate has blocked bipartisan  
campaign finance reform,'' President Clinton said in a written 
statement. He said the Senate's action was ``a victory for the 
politics of cynicism, and it leaves unchecked the influence of 
moneyed special interests.'' Filibusters killed campaign finance 
legislation in 1996, 1997 and last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans customarily raise more campaign funds than  
Democrats. But ironically, Clinton lamented the Senate's action 
shortly before his scheduled appearance at fund-raising events for 
congressional Democrats, including one at the home of Sen. Jay 
Rockefeller, D-W.Va. Senate Democrats also have a fund-raising 
event scheduled Wednesday night, at which they hope to raise $2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The day's first vote, 52-48, came on legislation patterned after  
a bill the House approved earlier this year, and that McCain and 
Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., supported in last year's debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The second vote, 53-47, came on a slimmed down bill that McCain  
and Feingold decided to push this year in an attempt to thwart 
McConnell's annual filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	That bill would have banned soft money and would have allowed  
nonunion members to stop labor unions from spending their mandatory 
dues on political activities. 
</P>
<P>
	But it had been stripped of one key element of last year's bill:  
a provision to restrict so-called ``issue ads,'' thinly veiled 
attacks on candidates paid for with soft money. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's decision prompted a sharp attack from Senate Minority  
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., who argued that majority Republicans 
had not followed through on commitments related to the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	But McCain cast blame on both parties.  
</P>
<P>
	``The opponents of comprehensive reform oppose even the most  
elemental reform,'' he said. ``...Those opponents abide on both 
sides of the aisle, if not in equal numbers, then in sufficient 
numbers to render any attempt to clean up the system a very 
difficult challenge indeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's presidential ambitions have hovered in the background  
of the debate in recent days -- McConnell and other Republicans 
complained at length about statements on his campaign Web site that 
soft money was corrupting. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Arizona Republican told reporters he believes his  
advocacy of the campaign finance measure was in part responsible 
for his emergence as Texas Gov. George Bush's principal rival in 
the polls in the nation's first presidential primary state. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm at 21 (percent) in New Hampshire and what am I campaigning  
on? I'm campaigning on reform.'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain and Feingold decided in advance of debate to offer a  
slimmed down bill in hopes they could surmount the threatened 
filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	They also hoped they had won a Lott's agreement to permit a  
traditional style of debate in which amendments were debated and 
voted on. That way, they said, Republicans who previously have 
opposed the measure might be brought on board if their own 
provisions won approval. 
</P>
<P>
	That strategy quickly started to unravel, though.  
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the measure consumed considerable time by demanding  
that McCain name the names of senators corrupted by soft money, as 
his campaign Web site appeared to claim. 
</P>
<P>
	For their part, Democrats sought to force a vote on the broader  
campaign overhaul measure that McCain and Feingold had discarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Feingold insisted he and McCain had made progress.  
</P>
<P>
	``Three senators, who in the past have stuck with the chief  
opponent of reform (McConnell) have finally had it with this 
corrupting soft money system,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That was a reference to the shifting group of Republicans who  
sided with McCain and Feingold on the two votes earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	On the first, the Democrats were joined by McCain as well as  
Republicans John Chafee of Rhode Island; Susan Collins and Olympia 
Snowe of Maine; James Jeffords of Vermont; Arlen Specter of 
Pennsylvania and Fred Thompson of Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	On the second vote, Republican Sens. Sam Brownback of Kansas;  
Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas and William Roth of Delaware voted with 
McCain and all 45 Democrats. But Specter and Chafee sided with GOP 
opponents on that vote, leaving advocates of the legislation only 
one vote better off than when they started.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Push Ahead; Dow Up 130.44 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were sharply higher in early trading  
today after a key report on inflation showed that prices at the 
consumer level have increased no more steeply than analysts had 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 130.44 at 10,246.72, extending its gain of 96.57 on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 12.68 at 1,266.81, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was up 11.01 at 2,700.16. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks soared after the Labor Department said today its Consumer  
Price Index, the government's most closely watched inflation gauge, 
jumped 0.4 percent in September. That was the biggest increase in 
five months, but it was in line with Wall Street's expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	A persistent fear that inflation is on the rise has hampered  
stocks in recent weeks, driving the Dow 10.7 percent below its Aug. 
25 record close. Investors fear that rising inflation will prompt 
the Federal Reserve to raise interest rate for the third time this 
year in a bid to slow economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	While today's report is unlikely to prevent the Fed from raising  
rates, analysts were heartened by components of the report that 
suggested inflation remains under control. Outside of the volatile 
food and energy sectors, prices were up 0.3 percent, leaving the 
so-called core rate of inflation rising at a much more moderate 1.9 
percent so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	A wide range of Dow stocks rose today. American Express gained 3  
5/16 to 141 3/16, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 3 to 97 1/2 after 
reporting earnings that beat analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell provided one blemish on the market today, falling 3 1/4 to 38  
1/16. The nation's largest direct seller of computers said late 
Monday a surge in the price of computer memory chips will likely 
hurt its third-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-6 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 117.49 million 
shares, ahead of Monday's early pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.75 to 412.65.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.1 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.6 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
1.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Kissinger Visits Middle School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Henry Kissinger, on a visit to a school in his  
old neighborhood, told students the idea of becoming secretary of 
state was ``out of the question'' when he was growing up. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone had said to me, `In 30 years, you're going to have  
an office next to the president of the United States,' I would've 
said he's nuts,'' Kissinger, 76, told sixth-grade students Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger, a German refugee, told the students at the Eleanor  
Roosevelt Middle School about the Holocaust, his life in a 
three-room apartment, baseball and political life in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	As a teen-ager in Manhattan's Washington Heights neighborhood,  
Kissinger worked in a shaving brush factory for $10.89 a week while 
attending high school at night. So when a student asked him if he 
always wanted to be secretary of state, he laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I gave $8 to my parents; I kept $2.89 for myself,'' he said.  
``The idea to become secretary of state -- out of the question.''

<HEADLINE> Teacher Web Site Hit by Prank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- An Internet site used by teachers across  
the country recently included what looked like a note from a 
teacher admitting he molested children and dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	But it turned out to be a prank by a student at the teacher's  
high school in East Greenwich, police say. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-year-old student was charged on Oct. 6 with the use of  
false computer information, a misdemeanor, and could be expelled. 
He was released to the custody of his parents and is due to appear 
before the East Greenwich juvenile hearing board this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The prank has the owners of SchoolNotes.com wondering how they  
can increase security on the Web site, which is used by about 
25,000 teachers to post curriculum information and homework 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricardo Valencia, a spokesman for Copernicus Interactive, which  
owns SchoolNotes.com, said the company is ``appalled'' by the boy's 
act and ``very concerned about students being able to access or to 
hack their way onto the Web site.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers must subscribe to the service to post information.  
Posing as the teacher, the student created an account in the 
teacher's name and posted the note, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither was identified.  
</P>
<P>
	Another teacher at the school discovered the note and informed  
school authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The student has admitted to the crime, said East Greenwich  
police Det. Lt. William Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thought it would be a funny prank for him and his friends  
to view,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Barcelona Reaches Champions League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Barcelona became the first team to qualify for the  
final 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday, while Lazio virtually 
wrapped up a spot. 
</P>
<P>
	But defending champion Manchester United was beaten by Olympique  
Marseille, ending its 17-match undefeated streak in Europe's top 
club competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Barcelona defeated Arsenal 4-2 and Lazio beat Slovenia's Maribor  
4-0. Barcelona took control in Group B with 10 points, the same as 
Lazio has atop Group A. 
</P>
<P>
	In Group D, Williams Gallas scored in the 69th minute for  
Olympique Marseille as Manchester United 1-0 fell one match shy of 
tying Ajax's record of 18 straight games undefeated in Europe's top 
competition. Marseille leads the group with nine points. 
</P>
<P>
	There was another major upset in Group C as Borussia Dortmund  
was stunned 3-0 by Norwegian champions Rosenborg. Rosenborg took 
control of the group with eight points. 
</P>
<P>
	Barcelona guaranteed itself a place in the next stage as Rivaldo  
and Luis Enrique Martinez scored in a one-minute span early in the 
first half and Luis Figo and Philip Cocu added clinchers early in 
the second. 
</P>
<P>
	The top two clubs in each of the eight groups move on to the  
second stage. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Group A    	
</P>
<P>
                         *Lazio 4, Maribor 0    	
</P>
<P>
	At Maribor, Slovenia, Lazio, which is virtually through with two  
games remaining, opened the scoring in the 36th minute on a free 
kick by Sinisa Mihajlovic. Maribor has three points. 
</P>
<P>
                   *Dynamo Kiev 4, Bayer Leverkusen 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Kiev, Ukraine, Dynamo Kiev, semifinalists a year ago, staved  
off elimination on goals from Vitalii Kossovski, Maksim Shatskikh, 
Olexander Holovko and Vladyslav Vaschuk. Dynamo has four points, 
Leverkusen five. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Group B    	
</P>
<P>
                       *Barcelona 4, Arsenal 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Wembley, England, the victory got Barcelona through and left  
Arsenal on the cusp with five points, tied with Fiorentina. 
</P>
<P>
                      *Fiorentina 3, AIK Solna 0    	
</P>
<P>
	At Florence, Italy, Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta's early  
free kick went in off a defender and countryman Abel Balbo scored 
an insurance goal. The loss virtually eliminated AIK Solna. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Group C    	
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Man vs. Woman in Kickboxing Bout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- A man and woman plan to fight in a near  
anything-goes kickboxing match Thursday, and the mayor wants to 
stop it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like kickboxing in the first place -- and kickboxing  
between a man and a woman, I really don't like that,'' Mayor Wayne 
Brown told The Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Proctor, who helped arrange the fight, said the city won't  
be able to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing they can do. They're not illegal,'' the owner  
of Absolute Martial Arts in Mesa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill FitzGerald, a spokesman for the Maricopa County Attorney's  
Office, agreed. He thinks the bout does not appear to violate state 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	The match between 24-year-old Sunshine Fettkether and  
39-year-old Randy Pittman is to be the main event of Cage Wars II, 
an 11-card show featuring amateurs in boxing, karate, wrestling and 
street fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	The kickboxers will wear gloves similar to boxing gloves and  
fight in accordance to Muay Thai rules, which permit punches and 
kicks to the head and body. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight is scheduled for three two-minute rounds or until one  
fighter is knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
	This would be the second man vs. woman bout this month. On Oct.  
10 in Seattle, Margaret McGregor dominated Loi Chow for four 
rounds. That was believed to be the first time a man fought a woman 
in a sanctioned boxing match.

<HEADLINE> Northwest, America West Earnings Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Northwest Airlines reported its third-quarter earnings were hurt  
by higher fuel prices while Southwest Airlines said its profits 
dropped because of rising fuel costs and due to flight 
cancellations from Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, America West, which also reported earnings today,  
said its profits rose 1.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Here is a look at the companies' results:  
</P>
<P>
	 *
</P>
<P>
                      *Northwest Airlines Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	Northwest reported profits of $180 million, or $1.96 per share,  
compared with a $224 million, or $2.91 per share, strike-related 
loss last year, but said high fuel prices and excess capacity 
throughout the industry cut into earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	A 15-day pilots' strike and related labor problems forced  
Northwest to cancel flights in the 1998 quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest quarter's results fell 2 cents short of the  
expectations of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 47 percent to $2.84 billion, from $1.93 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Operating income came to $370 million for the quarter, and  
compared with an operating loss of $275 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	President and chief executive John Dasburg said high fuel prices  
continue to affect earnings throughout the industry, which has also 
been hurt by overcapacity, which means available space on airplanes 
is greater than demand. Eagan, Minn.-based Northwest filled 77.7 
percent of its seats in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	If those trends continue, Dasburg warned that Northwest's fourth  
quarter financial performance could also be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest shares rose 56 cents to $26.31 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, Northwest earned $271 million, or  
$2.95 a share, compared with a loss of $104 million, or $1.25 a 
share, in the first nine months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues increased to $7.72 billion from $6.83 billion.  

</P>
<P>
                       *Southwest Airlines Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	Southwest reported a 2.3 percent drop in net earnings to $127  
million, or 24 cents a share, from $130 million, or 24 cents a 
share, for the same quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported third-quarter revenues of $1.24 billion, up  
from 1.1 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas-based carrier said profit was hurt by higher jet fuel  
prices and flight cancellations caused by Hurricane Floyd, which 
hit the southeastern United States in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Southwest met the 24 cent-a-share expectations of  
analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Southwest's stock rose 19 cents to $16.94 a share on the New  
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported its fuel costs rose 48 percent above last  
year's prices, to nearly $143 million, while average jet fuel 
prices rose 32.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline chairman and CEO Herb Kelleher said bookings for the  
remainder of the year are good but the airline expects modest 
non-fuel cost increases in the fourth quarter. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Poll: No Dominant Campaign Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The absence of one dominant issue so far in  
the 2000 presidential campaign could make Americans' perception of 
the personal and leadership qualities of the candidates more 
important, a new poll suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	The issues people most want to hear discussed are health  
insurance, the proper use of U.S. troops and the future of Social 
Security and Medicare, according to the survey released Monday by 
the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The increased emphasis on perceptions of personal and leadership  
qualities appear to have hampered Al Gore in head-to-head matchups 
with GOP front-runner George W. Bush, who had been running 11 to 15 
points ahead of the vice president. Gore narrowed the gap to 7 
points, 51-44, in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore benefits from increased support among women; 50 percent of  
women would vote for Gore today compared to 40 percent in 
September, while 45 percent of women in this poll said they back 
Bush. Support for Gore remains unchanged among men at 37 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center, noted ``how  
steady the Bush lead is among men and how variable it is among 
women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Women seem to be less focused on Gore's personal  
shortcomings,'' Kohut said, ``but men seem more focused on his 
personal qualities as negatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several polls this year have shown the public thinks Gore has  
integrity and intelligence, but is seen by many people as boring 
and not a leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those who opposed Gore, about half cited his close ties to  
President Clinton as a reason, while more than a third said it was 
his personality and leadership abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,032 adults was taken Oct. 7-11 and has an error  
margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, plus or minus 4 
percentage points for registered voters, and slightly larger for 
subgroups such as Democratic or Republican primary voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and Gore had substantial leads in the race for their own  
parties' nominations in this poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Though their interest was spread over a wide range of issues,  
those surveyed were most likely, 62 percent, to show a high level 
of interest in discussion of how the poor and uninsured can get 
health insurance. Those most inclined to say they wanted to hear 
about health insurance were female, black and had incomes under 
$30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost a fourth of the public have closely followed proposals by  
presidential candidates to expand health coverage for the poor, 
more than the 17 percent who follow campaign news in general. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and his Democratic presidential rival, former New Jersey  
Sen. Bill Bradley, have offered comprehensive proposals on 
expanding health care for the uninsured. Gore's plan focuses on 
children while Bradley would ensure access to affordable coverage 
for children and adults in low- and middle-income families. 
Republican candidates, including Bush, suggest various combinations 
of expanded medical savings accounts and tax incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority in the poll, 56 percent, said they're very interested  
in hearing about whether U.S. troops should be sent into countries 
to stop the killing of innocent civilians in a civil war. Those 
most likely to want to hear more about that issue were men and 
those with some college education. 
</P>
<P>
	Half said their top priority for campaign discussion was keeping  
Medicare financially sound, and almost that many, 46 percent, said 
they wanted to hear discussion of investing Social Security funds 
in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Those most likely to want to hear about Medicare were women,  
those with at least a high school education, those making less than 
$30,000 a year and older Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	While the poll ``does show a little progress for Gore, there's  
still a lot of uncertainty here,'' said Kohut, noting the election 
was more than a year away. ``We will see a lot of ups and downs. 
People don't have a lot of conviction about this.''

<HEADLINE> Cleveland Browns Aquire Abdul-Jabbar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Desperate for some help with their running  
game, the Cleveland Browns acquired running back Karim Abdul-Jabbar 
from the Miami Dolphins on Tuesday for a future draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion Browns, who dropped to 0-6 with a loss at  
Jacksonville last Sunday, traded their sixth-round pick in next 
year's draft for Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Browns extend Jabbar's contract before the last day of  
the NFL's 1999 fiscal year -- an undetermined date in February -- the 
Dolphins would also acquire Cleveland's fifth-round pick in the 
2001 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are excited to have Karim join us,'' said Dwight Clark,  
Cleveland's director of football operations. ``He is a good young 
back and will be given the opportunity to contribute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar, 25, started three of Miami's games this season,  
rushing for 95 yards and one touchdown in 28 attempts. He also had 
four receptions for 25 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was benched in favor of rookies Cecil Collins and J.J.  
Johnson and was inactive for Miami's past two games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Karim has done a great job for us in the past,'' Dolphins  
coach-general manager Jimmy Johnson said. ``However, with the 
emergence of our young running backs, playing with the Browns will 
be a good situation for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following a season-high 113-yard performance against the  
Jaguars, Cleveland's rushing offense improved its ranking to 26th 
in the league. But the Browns' inability to run the ball 
consistently has allowed defenses to play close to the line of 
scrimmage and put more pressure on rookie quarterback Tim Couch. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Kirby, primarily a third-down back throughout his career,  
has been the Browns' featured back, with George Jones and recently 
acquired Rashaan Salaam as backups. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby has rushed for 300 yards on 85 carries and one TD through  
six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark said Browns president Carmen Policy personally handled the  
negotiations with Johnson, and was able to finalize the trade 
before Tuesday's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Carmen) shook off the rust, got on the phone directly with  
Jimmy Johnson, and closed the deal for us,'' Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins selected Abdul-Jabbar in the third round of the  
1996 draft out of UCLA. He is ranked second to Larry Csonka (53) in 
Dolphins history with 33 career touchdowns, and his 3,063 yards 
rushing place him fifth on Miami's career list. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Jabbar was expected to be in Cleveland on Wednesday  
morning for a physical.

<HEADLINE> Boston Beset by Blown Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- So these are baseball's best umpires, huh?  
</P>
<P>
	Hard to believe it, especially after seeing yet another blown  
call go against the Boston Red Sox in a key spot of the AL 
Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than shouting ``Out!'' or ``Stee-rike!'' this is what  
umps are now sputtering too often: ``I blew it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Reed admitted his error on a dropped throw in Game 1. It  
was Tim Tschida's turn on a missed tag in Game 4 Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't make the right call,'' Tschida said. ``That's a  
frustrating thing for an umpire, because we like to call everything 
properly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And when a third close play went against the Red Sox, fans at  
Fenway Park littered the field with debris, forcing the New York 
Yankees to flee for safety in their 9-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``They made mistakes that umpires make and they're man enough to  
admit it,'' said Marty Springstead, the AL's executive director of 
umpiring. ``They missed a couple calls. It doesn't mean that you're 
a bad umpire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said commissioner Bud Selig on Monday: ``I think the umpires  
themselves have made the appropriate comments. I don't want to say 
anything other than we have some of our finest umpires involved in 
this series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the timing could not have been worse.  
</P>
<P>
	Not after all the acrimony this year that resulted in 22 umpires  
losing their jobs. Not after veteran NL umpire Frank Pulli was 
chastised for using a television replay -- a big no-no in the majors 
-- to get a call correct. Not after baseball stressed it uses a 
merit system to pick the postseason crews. 
</P>
<P>
	``The postseason is a harsh historian and some of these are not  
easily forgotten,'' said Sandy Alderson, the majors' executive vice 
president of baseball operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very good group of umpires,'' he said. ``Tim Tschida  
and Rick Reed are very highly rated. Their rotation doesn't come 
into play. These guys are quality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	True, Tschida rated eighth and Reed ranked 14th among 32 AL  
umpires in an offseason survey done by players. But after problems 
in last year's ALCS -- a couple of missed calls, plus Jim McKean 
being hit by a catcher's throw on a steal attempt -- this has not 
looked pretty. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel it's being taken away from us, but we don't know  
why,'' Boston outfielder Darren Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees won the best-of-7 series with a 6-1 victory Monday  
night. Umpires were booed, one-by-one, as they were introduced 
before Game 5 but there weren't any more blown calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The NLCS umpires, meanwhile, have mostly stayed out of trouble.  
They had trouble figuring out the final score in the New York Mets' 
4-3 win Sunday in 15 innings, but the wild ending against Atlanta 
left a lot of people wondering. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's contract with umpires says, ``League presidents shall  
have full discretion in the assignment of umpires to special 
events.'' Those are defined as postseason games and the All-Star 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	There are two other factors in the selection process: Umpires  
cannot work the World Series in consecutive years, and they can do 
only one ``special event'' per season. There's one exception -- an 
umpire can work the first round of the playoffs and the World 
Series in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to that 1991 contract, umpires got to work those big games  
on a rotating basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderson said baseball might try to get rid of all restrictions  
during negotiations this winter. He did not see a future for 
instant replay in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a consideration at this time,'' he said. ``It's being  
used in other sports, but we're more of a traditional sport and we 
move a little slower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the umpires' union office in Philadelphia was flooded  
with phone calls from angry fans, many of them Red Sox rooters. 
</P>
<P>
	A banner headline in the Boston Herald read: ``Robbed Again.''  
Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino issued a statement apologizing for 
the ``inappropriate behavior'' by the Fenway fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd went crazy after Boston manager Jimy Williams threw  
his hat and was ejected while arguing with first-base umpire Dale 
Scott in the bottom of the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Bottles came flying out of the stands, and umpires waved the  
Yankees off the field during an eight-minute delay. Yankees owner 
George Steinbrenner blamed Williams for the bedlam, charging, ``He 
incited it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never worried about Georgie Porgie,'' Williams responded  
Monday. ``I didn't incite it. The calls on the field incited it, 
not me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston players were frustrated, too, but did not take it out on  
the umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very sure the umpires don't want to play a part in the  
outcome of the ballgame,'' third baseman John Valentin said. ``It's 
just too bad it turned out that way.''

<HEADLINE> House GOP To Pursue Voucher Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Facing certain opposition from the Clinton  
administration, House Republicans promised Tuesday to push for more 
state control over federal education spending and a five-year 
experiment to give poor or abused children vouchers for private 
schooling. 
</P>
<P>
	The voucher plan, which would offer elementary students in  
low-performing schools up to $3,500 in tuition for alternatives, is 
among several proposals being considered Wednesday as the House 
debates renewal the $8 billion Title I program for disadvantaged 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	``This initiative puts parents in the driver's seat,'' said  
House Majority Leader Dick Armey, main sponsor of the voucher idea, 
which includes a provision to allow pupils through grade 12 to 
leave violent schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats already at loggerheads with Republicans over spending  
issues promised Tuesday to keep private-school vouchers out of the 
renewal of Title I, which includes federal education aid targeted 
to 11 million of the nation's poorest children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any voucher proposal is going to get signed into  
law,'' said David Frank, spokesman for Education Secretary Richard 
Riley. ``This represents fresh evidence of the Republican 
leadership's hostility to public education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Armey plan, which would work largely like a governor  
declares natural disasters, would allow governors to proclaim 
``academic emergencies'' in schools with chronically low test 
scores and other signs of failure. They could use federal funds to 
give those schools' students ``academic relief'' -- up to $3,500 a 
year to cover tuition and fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, student victims of a violent criminal act at  
school could apply for the vouchers to transfer to other public, 
private or parochial schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Voucher opponents argue the certificates would drain money from  
the public system if spent on private schooling. Supporters argue 
all schools would improve from the competition that vouchers would 
foster. 
</P>
<P>
	Two voucher plans were defeated in committee last week.  
</P>
<P>
	Title I and other federal education programs in the Elementary  
and Secondary Education Act must be reauthorized by Congress every 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since its inception in 1965 to close the  
achievement gap between rich and poor students, Republicans control 
Congress -- and with it the process of rewriting the law. 
</P>
<P>
	There are few changes from 1994, when it was overhauled from a  
remedial program to a high-standards program. However, changes 
House lawmakers will consider include new limits on hiring 
teachers' aides instead of teachers, new formulas for determining a 
school's poverty status and elimination of programs aimed at girls 
and native Hawaiians. 
</P>
<P>
	Also this week, the House is expected to debate the Academic  
Achievement for All Act, which would let states combine program 
funding in exchange for demonstrable student progress. 
</P>
<P>
	That measure -- part of a long-running debate over the extent of  
state control of federal education spending -- also is opposed by 
the president.

<HEADLINE> Tide's Samuels Enjoying Recognition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- When John Hannah runs out the ceremonial  
game ball before Alabama plays Tennessee this Saturday, the former 
Crimson Tide lineman plans to stick around to see just how 
threatened his legacy really is. 
</P>
<P>
	Hannah, an NFL Hall of Famer long regarded as the best offensive  
lineman Alabama has sent to the pros, is in danger of losing that 
title to current Tide tackle Chris Samuels. 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-6, 300-pound senior, Samuels has started 36 straight  
games for No. 10 Alabama and is a semifinalist for the Lombardi 
Award, given annually to the top college lineman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris Samuels, in our opinion, is maybe the best offensive  
lineman in college football,'' said coach Mike DuBose, who often 
draws the comparisons between Hannah and Samuels. ``We have yet to 
see anyone better than him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Samuels, the recognition is long overdue.  
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I thought I should've been up in the top five, but  
it didn't work out,'' he said. ``This year, a lot of people have me 
number one, others have me second or third. I'm just glad to be up 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samuels anchors the left side of Alabama's line. Through the  
Tide's six games this season (5-1, 4-0 Southeastern Conference), 
Samuels has yet to give up a sack or quarterback pressure from the 
left side. He also has 33 knockdown blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love him,'' quarterback Andrew Zow said. ``To have him  
protecting my blind side, I know I don't even have to worry about 
defenders getting through to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his size, Samuels has surprising speed, agility and  
endurance. He played 732 of a possible 744 snaps last season and 
refuses to come out of a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He runs like a linebacker and he blocks like one, too,'' left  
guard Griff Redmill said. ``He was a good player the last two 
years, but he's taken it to a whole new level now. He covers my 
mistakes and he makes the entire line raise our level of play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he's also helped tailback Shaun Alexander raise his numbers.  
In last week's 214-yard performance against Mississippi, Alexander 
gained most of his yards running off left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose said Alabama's play-calling grew predictable as the game  
went on, but play-caller Charlie Stubbs said he couldn't go away 
from something that was working so well. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we need a crucial few yards, Chris will come to me and say,  
`I can dominate this defender, I will open this hole for you,' '' 
Stubbs said. ``And he's telling the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samuels, who said the Ole Miss game was his best this season  
because he had eight pancake blocks, wants the play-calling to be 
predictable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm kind of selfish because I want them all to be run behind  
me,'' he said. ``But Shaun helps by putting up the numbers he does. 
I can't take all the credit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who has 934 yards and 17 touchdowns this season, is  
willing to give Samuels all the credit. He said by the time he gets 
to the line, Samuels has already cleared a five-yard lane for him 
to run through. 
</P>
<P>
	``You run behind him, and he might block one, two or even three  
guys himself,'' Alexander said. ``By the time I get to the line, 
there's one dead body on the ground and maybe two or three badly 
bruised guys depending on what kind of mood he's in.''

<HEADLINE> Psychologists Join Teachers Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Trying to regain the clout they have lost to  
managed care, New York psychologists are forming an alliance with 
unionized teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance between the 3,200-member New York State  
Psychological Association and the American Federation of Teachers 
was touted Tuesday as the first such agreement in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Psychologists have complained that health maintenance  
organizations have eroded their decision-making authority by 
limiting visits, cutting reimbursement rates and reducing coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Association leaders said affiliating with the AFT and its state  
affiliate, the 400,000-member New York State United Teachers, will 
give psychologists new political power. 
</P>
<P>
	``It brings our members a new kind of strength,'' Association  
chief executive Diane Brenner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like private physicians, psychologists in private practice  
cannot form a union on their own because of antitrust laws. Joining 
the teachers will not allow the teachers union to bargain for the 
psychologists, since most of them are considered ``independent 
contractors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Psychologists, unlike psychiatrists, are not medical doctors.  
But their move comes amid growing resentment among health care 
practitioners toward HMOs. This summer, the American Medical 
Association endorsed unions for doctors.

<HEADLINE> Seau Never Rests on Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Say Ow. Say Wow. Then say this: Junior Seau and  
his buddies are having another sensational season. 
</P>
<P>
	The excitable San Diego Chargers linebacker and his teammates  
gained attention last year when they finished with the NFL's 
top-ranked defense. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was one problem. Their work was constantly undermined  
by all those blunders by inexperienced quarterbacks Ryan Leaf and 
Craig Whelihan. 
</P>
<P>
	The offense is still taking baby steps, even behind veterans Jim  
Harbaugh and Erik Kramer. While it improves, it's getting a free 
ride. That's how good San Diego's defense is. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprising Chargers are 4-1 and leading the AFC West  
following their 13-10 win over the Seattle Seahawks in which the 
defense again starred. Another big game is coming up Sunday, at 
home against the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers were knocked off the No. 1 perch by allowing the  
Colts' Peyton Manning to throw for a franchise-record 404 yards in 
their only loss. But they stuff the run like no other team, 
allowing just 2.57 yards a carry, and no 100-yard runner in 24 
games. They've forced 14 turnovers, leading to 55 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers are a force because of coordinator Joe Pascale's  
attacking, harassing, scheme; Pro Bowlers Seau and strong safety 
Rodney Harrison; and free agent acquisitions such as linebacker 
Eric Hill and cornerback Darryll Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	But it all starts with Seau, whose motor runs the same whether  
it's a Friday practice or a Sunday encounter with Ricky Watters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having a great time with a great group of guys, and I'm  
enjoying it more this year than ever before,'' said Seau, a 10-year 
veteran who's played in the last eight Pro Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Seau won't say it, but his teammates will: He might be playing  
as well as anyone in the NFL right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my opinion, he's playing the best football of any  
linebacker in the game, any defensive player period,'' said fellow 
linebacker Lew Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt,'' said backup safety Greg Jackson, a former teammate  
of Lawrence Taylor's with the New York Giants. ``I mean, he's 
incredible, the things that he sees on the field as far as the run 
defense. He makes everyone else around him better with the things 
that he does. 
</P>
<P>
	``Junior's not a real vocal guy in the huddle, but when we line  
up to play, he's another person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the second of Kramer's four interceptions in the second  
half Sunday, Seau squashed a Seahawks drive by throwing Watters for 
a 5-yard loss on a third-and-8 draw play. Plays like that limited 
Seattle to just seven points off those four turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer, who spent his previous 10 seasons with Detroit and  
Chicago, has only had to face Seau in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, there's very few guys you come across you have to  
account for where they are all the time,'' said Kramer, who's 
directed three straight wins in relief of the injured Harbaugh. 
``And every time you come to the line of scrimmage you figure out 
where this guy is and how he might hurt you. Junior's one of those 
guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Seau is the leader, the Chargers have spread the  
wealth. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Lewis, picked up after Tennessee released him at the  
final cutdown, has a team-high three interceptions. He scored on a 
blocked punt and on a fumble caused by a hard hit by Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
	In the season opener, linebacker Gerald Dixon scored on a fumble  
forced by you know who -- Seau. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a great defense because we play together, not because we  
have individuals who are running around crazy doing a great job,'' 
Seau said. ``If you broke us up separately, who knows what would 
happen. When we're together and we're playing as a unit, it's hard 
to beat us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Again, it all goes back to Seau, who had double-digits in  
tackles the last three games to lead the team with 42. He also has 
a team-high three sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Junior used to take a lot of risks, a lot of chances, and now  
they're calculated and they equal results,'' Bush said. ``I just 
think this organization has surrounded him with guys that are 
thinking the same way. His intensity is contagious. It carries the 
team, his energy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seau was Bobby Beathard's first draft pick after he took over as  
general manager in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the neat thing about Junior is his enthusiasm has  
never done anything but continue to go up,'' Beathard said. ``After 
this many years and that many years of being a Pro Bowler, some 
guys go into cruise control. Not with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's because of the defense that the Chargers, so awful the last  
two years, can dare think about getting back to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of being unemployed in January,'' Seau said. ``Those  
were probably the hardest months the past two years, in my life, 
just watching the game go on without me. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels as if everyone is going to recess and we're in  
detention. We've been in detention for two years. We want to get to 
the posteason.''

<HEADLINE> New Reform Chair Mum on Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The list of potential Reform Party  
presidential candidates is heavy with big names and big bucks: 
Donald Trump and Ross Perot. Warren Beatty and Cybil Shepherd. 
Ex-wrestler-turned-Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura. Still-Republican 
Pat Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	So who does the party's incoming chairman think ultimately will  
win the nomination in 2000? 
</P>
<P>
	None of the above.  
</P>
<P>
	Jack Gargan, a retired financial planner from Cedar Key who will  
take over the fragmented party in January, said Tuesday he believes 
there's someone in the wings waiting to seize the candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know who it is. But I think when he or she steps  
forward, we'll say `Why didn't we think of that person?''' Gargan 
said after addressing the Forum Club, a nonpartisan group that 
hosts monthly speakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Whoever the candidate, Gargan said, the person will have to have  
money or organization. ``I don't see someone coming in who is an 
unknown,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gargan, a gregarious personality who admits he suffers a ``foot-  
in-mouth problem'' like his pal Ventura, would not reveal his 
personal choice. As chairman-elect, that wouldn't be appropriate, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He did note with some intrigue, however, that Trump has acted to  
place his name on the California ballot as a Reform Party 
presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't figure out whether he's just looking for publicity,''  
Gargan said. ``I think he's keeping his options open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Buchanan, who reportedly will announce next week that  
he's bolting the GOP to seek the Reform Party nomination, Gargan 
said: ``He's certainly made a lot of noises (as if) he's going to 
come on board. But I'll believe it when I see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reform Party nominee would qualify for $13 million in  
federal money, a nest egg that has attracted the attention of 
several potential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	That worries Gargan, who had hoped to change the way the party's  
candidate is selected to keep it within the party rather than on a 
general ballot. He lacks support of the current party leadership to 
do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our problem runs from the fact that anyone can say they're our  
candidate,'' Gargan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The party has been divided for years by splinter groups. It  
suffered further division recently in its response to comments made 
by its highest-elected member, Ventura. In this month's Playboy, 
Ventura criticized fat people for having a lack of willpower, said 
some organized religions are ``a sham'' and said he understood how 
the sailors in the Navy's Tailhook scandal would believe touching a 
woman's breast or buttocks was ``much ado about nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current chairman, Russell Verney, demanded that Ventura to  
quit the party. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Gargan said he believes Ventura's comments hurt the  
party, but only temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe we should have his head on a platter,'' Gargan  
said. ``Even with his foot-in-mouth faux pas, he still carries an 
approval rating many governors would envy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of the factional battles, Gargan called the Reform  
Party ``the hot ticket right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in it to win,'' he said. ``The key to remember is you  
don't have to have the majority to run this country. You just need 
the swing vote. And we're going for the swing vote.''

<HEADLINE> New Award Offers $250,000 Extra  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Winning a World Golf Championship event  
is worth $1 million. Playing well in all three of the events could 
be worth a little bit extra. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Federation of PGA Tours announced a new award  
Wednesday called the ``Andersen Consulting Medal,'' which will 
provide $250,000 to the player who earns the most money from the 
WGC tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Andersen Consulting, title sponsor of the Match Play  
Championship, also will present $250,000 to The First Tee in the 
winner's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Match Play champion Jeff Maggert is leading the race with  
$1,154,000. Tiger Woods, who won the NEC Invitational at Firestone 
two months ago, is second with $1,150,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The final WGC event is the American Express Championship in  
Spain in two weeks, a stroke-play event for the top 50 in the world 
ranking and top players from the five tours' money lists.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Cathedral Getting Reinforced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The city's newest pillars of faith will stand  
on rubber. 
</P>
<P>
	Our Lady of the Angels, the Roman Catholic archdiocese's new  
$163 million cathedral, will have 200 base isolators, giant rubber 
and steel devices designed to allow the structure to move slowly 
and safely during an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3,000-seat cathedral, scheduled to open in mid-2001,  
replaces St. Vibiana's Cathedral, a tiny church built more than 120 
years ago and closed after being badly damaged by the 1994 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	``Earthquakes are not an act of God, they are an act of  
nature,'' Cardinal Roger Mahony said Tuesday on a tour of the 
construction site a few days after a magnitude-7.1 earthquake shook 
Southern California. ``I think if were going to make God's house 
beautiful we might as well make it safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Structural engineer Nabih Youssef said the isolators will allow  
the cathedral to withstand ``the big one,'' a quake of a projected 
magnitude of 8.3, without damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Like shock absorbers for buildings, the key piece of each  
isolator is a rubber structure 40 inches in diameter and 19 inches 
tall. An isolator will be placed under every load-bearing column 
and wall below the basement level. 
</P>
<P>
	Base isolation systems are increasingly being used in the design  
of new buildings in earthquake country. Some old structures, such 
as City Hall, are being retrofitted with them. 
</P>
<P>
	The base isolation system added $3 million to $4 million to the  
cathedral's cost.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Jose Threatens Caribbean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POINTE-A-PITRE, Guadeloupe (AP) -- Hurricane Jose on Tuesday  
veered onto a collision course with the line of islands strung 
along the Eastern Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents on the French island of Martinique, where the storm is  
projected to pass overnight, began stockpiling water and food while 
Red Cross officials went on alert in Puerto Rico, where Jose could 
strike Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's getting stronger, and it looks like it's going to go  
through a lot of islands,'' said meteorologist Krissy Williams at 
the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. Forecasters said it 
was too early to say whether Jose might threaten the U.S. East 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10th named storm of the season was about 110 miles east of  
the island of Dominica late Tuesday night. Its winds had 
strengthened to 75 mph and it was moving west-northwest at 13 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane-force winds extended 25 miles to the northeast of the  
center, with tropical storm force winds stretching another 115 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pointe-a-Pitre, the capital of French Guadeloupe, residents  
lined up at supermarkets before 8 a.m. Tuesday and some stores ran 
out of bottled water and rice by midmorning. The island has not 
been hit by a hurricane since Hugo 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools broadcast messages asking parents to pick up their  
children. Homeowners boarded up windows and clambered onto roofs to 
remove satellite dishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``My parents lost their roof in Hugo because they didn't take  
the warning seriously -- I'm going to prepare myself for all 
eventualities,'' said a young man buying nails in a hardware store. 
</P>
<P>
	France posted hurricane alerts for Martinique, Guadeloupe, St.  
Martin and St. Barthelemy. Warnings also were in effect for 
Dominica, Montserrat, Antigua, Barbuda, Nevis, St. Kitts, St. 
Eustatius, Saba, St. Maarten and Anguilla, Puerto Rico, and the 
U.S. and British Virgin Islands. Barbados and St. Lucia were 
downgraded to tropical storm warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnival Cruise Lines said it was diverting one ship to the  
Cayman Islands and Jamaica to escape the storm. American Airlines 
canceled flights to Antigua from its hub in San Juan, Puerto Rico, 
and warned of further cancellations Wednesday. Tourists in the U.S. 
Virgin Islands were heading home, hoteliers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in British Montserrat, struggling to rebuild from a  
volcanic eruption, warned that heavy rains could create mudslides 
on the ash-covered flanks of the Soufriere Hills volcano. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricane Center warned people in the Dominican Republic to  
watch Jose carefully. Williams said the storm should be there by 
Friday, possibly headed for the storm-battered Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping a cold front through south Florida will push it  
back out to the ocean, but it's pretty early to tell,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Hurricane Georges churned through a dozen northeast  
Caribbean islands then ripped through the more populated Greater 
Antilles, killing more than 500 people and causing billions of 
dollars of damage.

<HEADLINE> Robert Ray Formally Replaces Starr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a young attorney not long out of law  
school, Robert Ray once went all the way to the highest court in 
the state of New York in an eight-year legal battle to save his 
family's mountainside cottage. Now he is taking on an even more 
grueling challenge -- to bring closure to the Whitewater probe. 
</P>
<P>
	The saga of the Ray family cottage in Fishkill, N.Y., shows that  
``there are a few attorneys smarter than Bobby is, maybe some more 
eloquent,'' but ``I don't know of any who make more of a habit of 
winning,'' says his brother, Russell, a lawyer who now has his own 
firm in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray's arguments in a trial before a local court were so  
compelling that the judge drove out to the mountain in a blizzard 
and went up in a four-wheel-drive vehicle to take a look at the 
Rays' cottage for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best trial attorneys are good storytellers'' and ``Bobby  
has a knack of ... making you identify with his point of view; you 
trust him,'' said Russell Ray. ``We wouldn't have won that case 
unless Bobby let that judge become almost part of the family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of an idyllic 154-acre tract of woods on the side of  
Mount Beacon terminated the leases of the 21 families who owned 
summer residences there, including the Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	``The owner didn't pay us a dime'' for the modest four-bedroom  
wooden frame dwelling the Rays had built, so ``we decided to stay 
and fight,'' Ray's mother, Margaret, recalled in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The cottage had been in the family for four generations and  
young Ray's father, an Army colonel with two tours of duty in the 
Vietnam War, had spent every summer of his boyhood there. The Ray 
brothers eventually won the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray's parents and his brother were among the family members on  
hand at the federal courthouse Monday for his private swearing-in 
ceremony before the three federal appeals court judges who selected 
him as Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courthouse, Ray promised his prosecutors would  
operate in ``a prompt, responsible and cost-effective manner,'' 
while being ``thorough and fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray has two investigative matters remaining that the Justice  
Department declined to accept because of potential conflicts of 
interest: 
</P>
<P>
	--An alleged attempt by Maryland developer and Democratic Party  
supporter Nathan Landow to influence the testimony of presidential 
accuser Kathleen Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	--Possible false statements regarding Hillary Rodham Clinton's  
role in the purge of the White House travel office just after the 
start of her husband's term. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray's biggest task could turn out to be the requirement that he  
write a final report on the wide-ranging Starr investigation that 
has delved into fraudulent land deals in Arkansas, including a 
development south of Little Rock called Castle Grande on which Mrs. 
Clinton engaged in legal work. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray was part of the legal team that obtained a felony plea from  
Webster Hubbell, the former law partner of Mrs. Clinton and at one 
time the No. 3 official in the Justice Department, on a charge of 
concealing his and Mrs. Clinton's work on Castle Grande. Hubbell 
says he knows of no wrongdoing by Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The contents of any final report would deal in part with Castle  
Grande, which could cause political trouble for the first lady in 
her run for the U.S. Senate from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In saving the family cottage, Ray showed the same tenacity he  
displayed in his first independent counsel investigation -- pursuing 
a lobbyist and a Tyson Foods executive involved in the probe of 
allegedly illegal gifts to Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Espy case in which the former Clinton Cabinet official was  
acquitted is one of the few losses Ray has been associated with. 
Ray persevered in the cases against the lobbyist and the company 
executive, eventually prevailing. The judge set aside guilty 
verdicts against the lobbyist and overturned guilty verdicts 
against the company executive. The lobbyist was convicted in a 
retrial and one of the Tyson executive's convictions was reinstated 
on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on his work in the Espy probe, Clinton supporters began  
questioning Ray's impartiality as soon as word leaked out last week 
that he was to finish up Starr's five-year probe of the president 
and his wife and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats may have trouble using the same argument that they  
used with Starr -- that he is a right-wing zealot out to get the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Until January 1998, Ray was a registered Democrat in New York  
City. He ran twice for the school board in New York City in 
nonpartisan elections, losing both times. He now is a registered 
voter in New Jersey unaffiliated with any political party. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray in recent years made four donations totaling $90 in support  
of Republicans -- three to then-Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and one to the 
Republican National Committee.

<HEADLINE> Finance Unit Probes Rights Pioneer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A civil rights pioneer and friend of President  
Clinton is being investigated by the Justice Department's campaign 
finance task force over allegations he may have been reimbursed for 
part of a $50,000 1996 contribution to the Democratic party, 
lawyers and officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernest G. Green, one of nine black youths who integrated Central  
High School in Little Rock, Ark., after the Supreme Court's 1954 
school desegregation ruling, is the subject of the probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Green is now Washington director of the Lehman Brothers  
investment banking firm. Green, who has been a guest of Clinton's 
here and in Little Rock, has denied any impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
	Last March, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House  
Committee on Government Reform, wrote Attorney General Janet Reno 
seeking a probe of whether Green was illegally reimbursed for a 
$50,000 donation he made to the Democratic National Committee on 
Feb. 6, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	That is also the date on which a Chinese arms dealer, whose  
visit was sponsored by Green, met Clinton at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang Jun, chairman of Poly Group, an arms trading company owned  
by the Chinese military, met the president at a February 1996 
coffee klatch for Democratic donors. The firm was under 
investigation for smuggling 200 AK-47 assault rifles into this 
country. Clinton later called the meeting inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	Green's attorney, E. Lawrence Barcella, said he had been  
contacted about the allegations by the Justice Department task 
force. ``This was clearly a partisan referral by Rep. Burton,'' 
Barcella said. ``We will work with the Justice Department to make 
sure it ends with a recognition there was nothing wrong done.''

<P>
	Burton also asked that the department investigate whether Green  
committed perjury before either his committee or a Senate committee 
in discussing his relations with former Little Rock restaurateur 
Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie, who has pleaded guilty in the 
investigation of 1996 campaign finances. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton pointed out that Green told a Senate committee he had not  
received any money from Trie, who raised hundreds of thousands of 
dollars for the Clinton campaign that were later returned amid 
suspicions the true donors might be foreigners barred from giving 
to U.S. campaigns. Later, Green told Burton's committee he received 
$2,000 in travelers checks from Trie to pay off a basketball bet.

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists Rap Bush Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN (AP) -- A coalition of environmental groups said Tuesday  
that ``intentional acts and conscious indifference'' by Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush, his appointees and the Legislature are responsible 
for the state's air pollution problems. They proposed a 12-step 
program to clean up the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Their criticism follows high ozone readings on Oct. 7 that  
pushed Houston ahead of Los Angeles as the U.S. metropolitan area 
with the most days when ozone exceeded the national health 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our air is less safe to breathe, affecting the health of our  
families and the economy,'' said Meg Haenn of the Texas Air Crisis 
Campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the air crisis is due to the intentional acts and  
conscious indifference of Governor Bush, his appointees to the 
Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and the 
Legislature,'' she said. ``There are both sins of omission and sins 
of emission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mindy Tucker, spokeswoman for Bush's Republican presidential  
campaign, said the governor's record shows a ``reasonable and 
balanced approach toward protecting our environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Bush became governor in 1995, Texas has experienced a 10  
percent reduction in industrial pollution and leads the nation in 
reducing release and disposal of toxics, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Bush was the first Texas governor to seek emission  
reductions from older plants that are ``grandfathered'' out of 
pollution regulations, and at Bush's urging more than 100 plants 
had voluntarily pledged to reduce emissions by more than 100,000 
tons a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Campaign year tactics like this only poison the spirit of  
cooperation that is resulting in significant progress toward 
cleaner air in Texas,'' Ms. Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
	State and local officials have said they suspect an unreported  
chemical release, possibly from an industrial plant, caused the 
Oct. 7 smog spike. The indicator that registered the pollution 
level is in the heavily industrial ship channel area. 
</P>
<P>
	But the coalition of 44 environmental and health groups said  
Houston's smog is only one measure of Texas' growing air pollution 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and  
the TNRCC, they said the highest 25 one-hour measurements of ozone 
in the nation this year all were in Texas, and 46 of the 51 
measurements of ``very unhealthy air'' that occurred in the United 
States were in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Air quality has worsened in the San Antonio, Austin and  
Longview-Tyler areas, which could fall under federal controls, the 
groups said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyrus Reed of the Texas Center for Policy Studies likened Texas'  
pollution problem to an addiction, and said a 12-step program is 
needed to clean it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 12-step programs, be it for overeating or overdrinking, the  
first thing you have to do is admit you have a problem. What we're 
really talking about here is a change in attitude -- stop denying 
the problem and admit it, and that will be a good first step toward 
cleaning up the air in Texas,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The environmentalists denied that they were speaking out because  
of Bush's front-running bid for the Republican presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they are focusing on the Legislature's ``sunset''  
review process now underway for the TNRCC and on a state Senate 
committee that's studying pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Democratic Party called on Bush to shake up the  
environmental agency and get tougher on polluters. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic chair Molly Beth Malcolm recalled that Bush's father  
used Boston Harbor pollution to attack his 1988 presidential 
opponent, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, and said: ``The air 
over Houston is going to be Governor Bush's Boston Harbor. But Bush 
seems to think it's much ado about nothing.''

<HEADLINE> Harding Ends Second in Pro Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Second place and a crowd on her side  
meant victory to Tonya Harding in her return to competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Making up for a rocky start, Harding skated a near-perfect  
routine Tuesday night to finish as the runner-up to Surya Bonaly at 
the Pro Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd forgotten how it felt to step on the ice,'' the  
28-year-old skater said. ``I will never forget this day. I will 
never forget this competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five years since her implication in the knee-whacking of rival  
Nancy Kerrigan and her last competition at the 1994 Lillehammer 
Olympics, Harding received the loudest ovation of the competition 
after her performance. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, she didn't beg for a do-over. Unlike Lillehammer, her  
skates were properly laced. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was definitely easier tonight,'' Harding said. ``Yesterday  
was an emotional day, being back with all my friends and seeing 
everyone and seeing how the crowd reacted to me. I was really 
excited to go out this evening and just skate and have fun. I was 
more relaxed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fourth place out of five skaters after Monday's technical  
program in which she fell twice on jumps, Harding entered the ice 
for warmups with a blank, emotionless stare. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to have my blinders on, just to concentrate on  
getting a very good warmup because yesterday my warmup wasn't 
exactly good,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a conservative white-and-black dress, Harding started  
her artistic program with a slow violin-and-guitar ballad and built 
to a techno-dance number titled ``Fired Up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She brought the Huntington Civic Arena crowd to its feet by  
nailing all three triple jumps and performing a variety of spins. 
After her third triple jump, she was beaming. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end she clasped her hands to her face in exhilaration and  
received a standing ovation. She blew kisses to the audience, and 
several people responded with ``We Love You Tonya.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the final results were announced, Harding and the other  
competitors exchanged hugs -- including Tonia Kwiatkowski, who like 
others had said she would never skate again with Harding. 
</P>
<P>
	She did, and got beat.  
</P>
<P>
	Harding had the second-best score of the night to finish tied  
with Rory Burghart. But Harding was awarded second place based on a 
tiebreaker. Kwiatkowski was fourth and Liz Manley fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, the event marked the first time Harding truly reaped  
the financial benefits of a skating boom she helped create. 
</P>
<P>
	Figure skating's popularity skyrocketed following the attack of  
Kerrigan which led to Harding's banishment from amateur competition 
by the sport's governing body. 
</P>
<P>
	``1994 was a down period in my career. Tonight's a new beginning  
for me,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her agent, Michael Rosenberg, would not say how much Harding was  
paid for her debut, other than the amount has five figures, or 
between $10,000 and $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``To her, it's a lot of money because she doesn't have any.  
She's trying to work her way back,'' he said. He said he advises 
his clients not to reveal what they are paid so they do not become 
crime victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenberg put other top clients in this event and assured them  
there would be no repercussions because of their presence alongside 
Harding. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've all been friends for a really long time,'' Harding said.  
``I missed them all so much. It's all just been terrific.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But only Bonaly and men's winner Alexei Urmanov, the 1994  
Olympic champion, accompanied Harding to a post-skate news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard maybe some rumors or some people say, `I don't want  
to skate with her,''' Bonaly said. ``I don't know why. It's their 
choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harding's presence did not sway skating fans to pack the show.  
The 5,780-seat arena was about half-full. Only a few hundred more 
fans were in attendance compared with Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just came to see the whole thing. I am truly not a fan of  
hers,'' said Sandra Ruggles of Chesapeake, Ohio. '' She's a very 
good skater. But I didn't think that overall it was a big deal.''

<HEADLINE> Colo. Gov. Mulls Ramsey Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Gov. Bill Owens says it may be some time before he  
makes a decision on whether to appoint a special prosecutor to 
investigate the JonBenet Ramsey slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor met with Boulder County prosecutor Alex Hunter and  
a special task force for four hours Monday at the state Capitol to 
take a second look at the case after a grand jury failed to issue 
any indictments following a 13-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side would comment before the session began. Owens'  
chief of staff said the group may meet again. 
</P>
<P>
	After the grand jury was dismissed last week, police said that  
JonBenet's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, remain under an 
``umbrella of suspicion'' in the slaying of JonBenet, 6, at their 
Boulder home. Hunter said Thursday they have not been eliminated 
from the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramseys have insisted they are innocent.  
</P>
<P>
	Early on Dec. 26, 1996, Patsy Ramsey told police she found a  
ransom note demanding $118,000 for her daughter's safe return. 
Eight hours later, JonBenet's father said he found his daughter's 
body in the basement. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Ramseys have hired prominent Atlanta libel lawyer  
L. Lin Wood to pursue possible lawsuits over stories written about 
them and their son. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood is best known for winning more than $500,000 from NBC for  
Richard Jewell, the security guard who was once identified, then 
cleared, as a suspect in the 1996 Olympic bombing in Atlanta. Wood 
also won a settlement for Jewell in a suit against CNN and is 
representing him in a case against The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution.

<HEADLINE> Sentence in Ex-Eagle's Dad Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) -- A woman was sentenced to 30 years in  
prison for stabbing the father of former Philadelphia Eagles wide 
receiver Kenny Jackson to death after he refused to give her money. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawn Wilson, 28, of South River, N.J., will not be eligible for  
parole during her sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	She pleaded guilty in August to felony murder for stabbing  
Robert McBride, 69, of South River on March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson's grandmother is Sarah Jackson, Kenny Jackson's mother  
and McBride's former companion. Her mother, Glenda Jackson, asked 
Superior Court Judge Barnett Hoffman to forgive her daughter on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``God is forgiving and loving. If he can forgive, we can too,''  
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said that Wilson stabbed McBride 54 times in his  
bedroom, then stole hundreds of dollars to buy drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny Jackson was the Eagles' top draft pick in 1984 out of Penn  
State. He also played for the Houston Oilers before retiring from 
professional football in 1991. He is now a football coach at Penn 
State.

<HEADLINE> Education Dept. Recalls Aid Forms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Two errors in college financial aid forms forced a massive  
recall by the U.S. Department of Education that could cause 
headaches and delays for students and their prospective colleges 
and universities. 
</P>
<P>
	While most of the 3.5 million bad forms were recovered, 100,000  
were distributed. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of students who have the forms is unknown.  
</P>
<P>
	Filled out by some 10 million students each year, the  
application forms are the standard by which federal and state 
governments as well as schools decide on loans, scholarships grants 
and other forms of student aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a situation where we literally stopped the presses,  
when the mistake was discovered,'' said Karen Freeman, spokeswoman 
for the agency's office of Student Financial Assistance in 
Washington, which produces the eight-page form. ``There were trucks 
en route when we caught this mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They weren't fast enough. Despite the recall, the forms were  
never retrieved from 61 schools. They landed at vocational and 
community colleges as well as universities, from the University of 
Hawaii at Hilo to Florida Metropolitan University 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Freeman said the whole mess will cost $480,000 to fix,  
including destroying the recalled forms, printing and expediting 
delivery of the new ones. 
</P>
<P>
	The mistakes refer to information applicants must cull from  
previous IRS filings. The first mistake, reported to the agency on 
Oct. 7, pertains to students or families who file tax returns by 
telephone. The second was uncovered Friday -- while the agency was 
deciding how to fix the first error. That one seeks information 
about Keogh pension plan for the self-employed. In each case, the 
applicant was directed to get information from the wrong line on 
the IRS form. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Fitzgerald, staff director for the Advisory Committee on  
Student Financial Assistance, an independent panel Congress set up 
to oversee the student aid program, described a cascade of problems 
from the two mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the season,'' he said, ``when parents and students  
begin to connect with colleges. They're visiting colleges. They 
begin to think seriously about applying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most schools set a Jan. 15 or Feb. 1 application deadline.  
Schools traditionally accept students by April 1, telling who will 
get aid as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``This can produce some serious delays and put a real crunch on  
institutions,'' Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to alerting the effected schools Monday on a special  
Web site, the corrected forms will be sent to a new post office 
box. Any of the erroneous forms that arrive at the old post office 
box will be checked and the applicant alerted if they filed out the 
lines with the mistakes.

<HEADLINE> Gore Gets Steelworkers Endorsement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore has picked up another  
labor union endorsement, this one from the United Steelworkers of 
America, which says it was backing him because he understands the 
human costs of free trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Union President George Becker, who as a delegate to the AFL-CIO  
convention last week also voted to endorse Gore, announced the 
decision of the Steelworkers' executive board at a news conference 
Tuesday in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker said Gore voted in favor of labor's positions when he was  
a senator and has been ``a champion of the rights of workers to 
organize into unions and a strong supporter of labor law reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Becker said Gore has supported the inclusion of labor rights in  
international trade treaties. He said the vice president is 
sensitive to labor issues and helped reduce steel imports from 
Russia.

<HEADLINE> ATM Surcharge Ban at US Bases Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon, seeking to help military  
personnel who are financially strapped, has proposed banning ATM 
surcharges on all U.S. military bases in this country and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department issued the proposal for public comment in  
August. The comment period ended last Tuesday and the department is 
expected to make a decision in 60 to 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal ``is a nuclear bomb that spells the beginning of  
the end of the ATM fee rip off,'' Jon Golinger, consumer program 
director for California Public Interest Research Group, said in a 
statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	His group is one of several organizing a Nov. 2 ballot  
proposition banning all ATM surcharges in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The highly unpopular surcharges are levied by banks on people  
who use their automated teller machines if they are not customers 
of that bank. They come on top of charges by customers' own banks 
for using an ATM operated by another bank. The surcharges now 
average $1.20 at banks and $1.15 at savings and loans, according to 
a report to Congress this summer by the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups oppose the surcharges, and they have been banned  
by Connecticut and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking industry generally defends them, insisting that ATM  
fees are clearly disclosed and consumers enjoy having the 24-hour 
convenience.

<HEADLINE> Gore Targets Deadbeat Dads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is proposing a  
crackdown on fathers who refuse to pay child support and government 
help for those who can't afford to. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our nation will continue to suffer social and economic  
consequences unless all fathers do more to help share the 
responsibilities of parenthood, and America does more to support 
them in this role,'' Gore said in remarks prepared for today. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Congress Heights Methodist Church here, Gore was laying  
out his ``responsible fatherhood'' package 24 hours before Bill 
Bradley, his sole rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, 
is due to unveil his plan to eradicate child poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said the vice president's plan also was designed to attack  
child poverty by remedying one of its biggest causes: financial and 
emotional abandonment by fathers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore proposed giving federal child-support funds only to states  
that require all non-custodial parents -- mainly fathers -- who owe 
child support to get a job and pay up, or go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	If elected president, Gore said he also would require fathers to  
sign ``personal responsibility contracts,'' in which they would 
acknowledge paternity and pledge to work to pay child support, as a 
condition of getting aid from the Welfare to Work program. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Gore's plan, the government would provide credit card  
companies with data on ``deadbeat dads'' who have not paid child 
support and urge lenders to deny them credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	For the lesser-spoken-of group of ``dead broke'' fathers who  
don't pay because they can't afford to, Gore would broaden 
regulations allowing states to use federal welfare money to help 
them find and keep jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 welfare reform law moved millions of families off  
welfare, Gore said. ``We must again call on states, communities and 
employers to help move unemployed fathers who owe child support 
into the workforce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Jones is president of Center for Fathers, Families and  
Workforce Development, a Baltimore program of ``tough love, 
in-your-face job training and readiness,'' he said -- and which Gore 
would like to see replicated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at ways to make the distinction between deadbeat  
and dead broke. If you're a low-income parent with little education 
and no job, we've got to take that into account as we put together 
these child support orders,'' said Jones, who was joining Gore 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also offered measures to help ensure children grow up in  
two-parent homes, including new grants to community and religious 
groups to ``help couples prepare for and strengthen their marriage, 
become better parents and reduce domestic violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president is making a habit of pre-empting Bradley's  
speeches. Days before the former New Jersey senator unveiled an 
ambitious and expensive plan last month to provide near-universal 
health insurance, Gore rushed together a more limited health plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``This certainly suggests that the vice president agrees with  
our agenda,'' Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said. ``But in the end 
the depth and significance of our proposals to solve big problems 
is far greater than his.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Chris Lehane fired back with a reference to  
Bradley's vote in the Senate in favor of President Reagan's 1981 
spending cuts. ``Al Gore's interest and commitment to strengthening 
families dates back long before he became interested in running for 
president, back to 1981 when he stayed and fought against the 
Reagan budget cuts that devastated programs for working families 
and the poor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a poll released Tuesday showed Gore and Bradley in a  
close race in Iowa, which holds the first presidential nominating 
contest in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was favored by 43 percent of the voters questioned, to  
Bradley's 40 percent, with 17 percent undecided. The survey of 617 
people who said they regularly vote in state elections was 
commissioned by KCCI, a Des Moines, Iowa, television station. It 
claimed a margin of error of plus or minus 6 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's campaign has gained ground in polls across the  
country, including in Iowa. A survey last month had him within 12 
points of the vice president in the state, where Gore generally had 
been given an edge because of his backing from the party 
establishment.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOMA LINDA, Calif. (AP) -- It was happy trails back home for Dale  
Evans, who left a hospital with a new pacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
	The 86-year-old entertainer and widow of cowboy star Roy Rogers  
was released from Loma Linda University Medical Center on Monday, 
almost a week after undergoing surgery to replace her pacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Evans was hospitalized Oct. 11 at Desert Valley Medical  
Center after suffering respiratory problems. Tests revealed she may 
have suffered a mild heart attack and she underwent surgery Oct. 12 
at Loma Linda. 
</P>
<P>
	She had been listed in serious condition for several days, but  
was upgraded to fair condition and then released on Monday, said 
Zarina Baqai, a hospital nursing supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Evans, known as ``The Queen of the West,'' starred in 35  
movies and a 1950s television series with her husband. She also 
co-wrote the couple's theme song, ``Happy Trails to You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, she has authored a number of inspirational books  
and is the host of a Trinity Broadcast Network talk show. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband died last year at age 86.

	The Prairie View Panthers were a weekly trivia question last  
season when they were blazing toward the nation's longest college 
football losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers ended the streak at 80 with a 14-12 victory over  
Langston on Sept. 26, 1998. Now they've returned to the anonymity 
of being weekly underdogs in the Division I-AA Southwestern 
Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``People always ask me, `How do you get them up?''' interim  
coach Clifton Gilliard said. ``We never have a down practice. They 
come back week after week and they see the vision that one day it 
will happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers won for only the second time this decade on Sept.  
11, a 21-7 victory over Howard Payne. They will take a 1-5 record 
into Saturday's game against Panhandle State. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt great to win that game,'' Gilliard said. ``It gave  
them an attitude that they could win. Even though we've just won 
one game they still have that belief. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going for 5-5 now. That's the best we can do and that's  
their goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until their victory last season, Prairie View hadn't won a game  
since Oct. 28, 1989, when they beat Mississippi Valley 21-12. 
Langston defeated the Panthers 19-18 the following week to begin 
the long losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Talent and numbers keep the Panthers down. The school awards  
only 15 scholarships. Most of their opponents in the Division I-AA 
SWAC play with 65 scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers start games with fresh legs but by the fourth  
quarter they're worn down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been that and it's still that,'' Gilliard said. ``That's  
what's haunting us right now. The only thing that will bring about 
change is a few more scholarships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers have scored 43 points this season but only 13 in  
the second half. Alabama A&AMP;M scored late for a 27-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had our chances this season,'' Gilliard said. ``With  
nine minutes to go in the fourth quarter, it's still 14-0 against 
Alabama A&AMP;M. I felt we could have beaten Southern but we ran out of 
gas, had too many turnovers and couldn't put points on the board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Southern won 42-0, one of three shutouts against the Panthers  
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Deontay Wilson is the Panthers' leading receiver  
and ranks No. 6 in the SWAC with 21 catches for 334 yards and three 
touchdowns. He scored all three of Prairie View's touchdowns in the 
victory over Howard Payne. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year, we expect to win,'' Wilson said. ``We feel  
hungrier, but we have had more injuries than last year and without 
scholarships that's keeping us down. We play well for a half and 
then we aren't as explosive in the second half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interim athletic director Walter Redd, who has been at the  
school for almost 50 years, wants his beloved Panthers to be known 
for something other than losing. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, the Panthers were big winners in the 1950s, winning a  
national title in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had one of the best records anywhere during the glory years  
of Prairie View,'' Redd said. ``That was an era where football and 
basketball were the main sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, the university sponsors 17 sports so I'd say that now  
we have a better overall program that serves the needs of the 
students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A national championship couldn't have drawn a more heartfelt  
celebration than the one that took place before dawn on the Prairie 
View campus after the Panthers ended their record streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilliard was a member of the 1958 championship team and was  
assistant athletic director until July 11. He replaced Greg 
Johnson, who is on administrative leave following unspecified 
accusations of irregularities in the football program. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts me so bad when we lose one and can't get it  
together,'' Gilliard said. ``They always have good practices. They 
go out every week and are never down. It makes me feel bad for them 
that we can't get back to winning.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Open Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged lower against the yen early  
Wednesday ahead of the release of U.S. trade data. Japanese stocks 
opened moderately higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency bought 105.22 yen, down 0.14 yen from late  
Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 105.28 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 169.18 points,  
or 0.98 percent, to 17,423.35 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
On Tuesday, the average closed down 21.16 points, or 0.12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar largely carried through on its  
listless trend in New York, where traders reacted little to a 
report showing U.S. consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in September. 
It was their biggest increase in five months, but still in line 
with expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Currency traders avoided making any significant moves Wednesday  
as they awaited the release of U.S. international trade data for 
August due out later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has been under pressure as the U.S. trade deficit has  
been at record levels in recent months and dollars have been 
flooding onto the world market. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was trading at 114.30 yen, up from  
114.06 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, the Nikkei average opened higher Wednesday as  
high-technology blue chips moved higher after gains in U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose  
88.65 points, or 0.9 percent, to 10,204.93 as the consumer price 
data was unsurprising and amid robust earnings announcements. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 24.78 points, or 1.68 percent, to 1,496.58. 
The TOPIX closed up 11.57 points, or 0.79 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was  
unquoted in early trading. On Tuesday, it settled at 1.7750 percent 
and its price stood at 99.35 yen.

<HEADLINE> 49ers McMillian Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Cornerback Mark McMillian's stay with  
the San Francisco 49ers was cut short Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	McMillian, the NFL's smallest player at 5-foot-7, was released  
by the 49ers in the aftermath of Sunday's 31-29 loss to Carolina in 
which Panthers receivers caught three scores over him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't working out and we felt we just needed to change  
gears here in midstream,'' coach Steve Mariucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	The discouraging part to the 49ers was McMillian usually had his  
receivers well covered but they kept outjumping him to make 
catches. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has won some snaps and lost some snaps, and that's going to  
happen,'' Mariucci said. ``He got challenged several times by 
taller receivers. He knocked some of them out of there and they're 
going to get some as well. We gave it every chance that we could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco's secondary, which has given up an NFL-high 15  
touchdown passes, has been beset by size mismatches this season. 
San Francisco's other top two cornerbacks, Darnell Walker and R.W. 
McQuarters, are 5-8 and 5-9, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers filled the roster vacancy by re-signing quarterback  
Pat Barnes for the third time in a month. Barnes was the third, or 
emergency quarterback, for two of the three games Steve Young has 
missed while sidelined from the effects of a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Young remains out indefinitely because of his fourth concussion  
in three years and there is no telling when or if he'll be cleared 
by doctors to play again. Young was expected to seek additional 
medical opinions this week and a decision could be made by next 
week on his future with the club. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Steve's uncertain status, we know we don't want to have  
just two quarterbacks active for a prolonged period of time. That's 
really taking a chance,'' Mariucci said. ``Pat was available. He 
had some other options to go elsewhere. We needed to act or he was 
going to be gone, so we decided to grab him and just play it 
safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no word yet on who would replace McMillian. The  
possibilities include Craig Newsome, San Francisco's tallest 
cornerback at 6-0, and Walker, who returned an interception for a 
touchdown Sunday as a nickel back after being demoted from the 
starting lineup last week for ineffectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	McMillian had started all six games at right cornerback and  
almost certainly would have been a target again Sunday, when the 
49ers play at Minnesota, which has wide receivers in Randy Moss, 
Cris Carter and Jake Reed who are 6-3 or taller. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't make the change because Randy Moss is going to line  
up against us. It happened because we felt we needed to make a 
decision on it,'' Mariucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	An eight-year veteran, McMillian was signed as a free agent this  
season and had one interception in six games. He has 22 career 
interceptions, including an NFL-best eight in 1997 while with 
Kansas City.

	Habibie's Party May Seek Replacement  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Leaders of Indonesian President  
Habibie's Golkar Party met privately to decide whether to replace 
him with another candidate after Habibie withdrew as a presidential 
candidate Wednesday. Habibie's decision to quit came hours after 
lawmakers rejected a speech in which he defended his 16 months in 
office. In a session that dragged from Tuesday into the early hours 
of Wednesday morning, the 700-member People's Consultative Assembly 
also voted to recognize East Timor's vote for independence, paving 
the way for the half-island territory to become the world's newest 
nation.

	Social Security Surpluses Safe in Budget  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and congressional leaders  
agreed tonight not to use Social Security surpluses to pay for 
federal spending, participants said. ``Now we just have to roll up 
our sleeves,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., 
following an 80-minute meeting at the White House. In recent weeks, 
Republicans have made leaving Social Security surpluses alone a 
major goal of their budget fight with Clinton. The president has 
agreed, though at one point he also proposed using the surpluses if 
Republicans would agree to do so.

	SHVUT RACHEL, West Bank (AP) -- Jewish settlers dismantled a  
water tower at a West Bank outpost late Tuesday, hours after 
hard-line demonstrators prevented them from complying with an order 
to evacuate 12 illegal settlements. The removal of the tower was 
the first step toward carrying out the government's order to take 
down 12 illegal settlements. Settler leaders have agreed to honor 
the order, but young settler activists had blocked them.

	GOP Kills Campaign Finance Overhaul

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to overhaul the nation's campaign  
finance laws fell to a Republican filibuster for the fourth 
straight year today, despite concessions by supporters designed to 
build fresh momentum for the measure. ``We will persevere,'' vowed 
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., whose call to reduce the role of money 
in campaigns is a cornerstone of his bid for the GOP presidential 
nomination. The bill's fate was sealed when the Senate twice fell 
short of the 60-vote majority needed to overcome the filibuster.

	Citadel Sex Bias Suit To Go Forward

	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A federal judge ruled today that The  
Citadel can be tried for sexual discrimination and five cadets can 
be tried for sexual harassment of a former female cadet. U.S. 
District Judge Joseph Anderson threw out about half the 34 charges 
brought by former cadet Jeanie Mentavlos, and ordered that the 
cadets and the once all-male military academy should be tried 
separately. Mentavlos, one of four women admitted to the state-run 
school in 1996, alleges she was hazed and harassed before she 
dropped out after one semester.

Cuba during the 1962 missile crisis with the Soviet Union. The

negotiators reached earlier with Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler

today, the NFL trading deadline. A first-round choice by the Bucs 
in 1996, Upshaw started 47 games in his first three seasons, making 
18 1/2 sacks and 104 tackles. But he never quite lived up to 
expectations, and with the Buccaneers deep on the defensive line, 
they demoted him to backup this year.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines Attendant Deal OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Flight attendants have approved a four-year  
agreement with Alaska Airlines that boosts wages and benefits and 
improves the retirement savings plan, a union official said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The favorable vote moves the airline one step closer to  
completing deals with the four major employee groups whose 
contracts were up for discussion this year -- flight attendants, 
mechanics, customer service agents and ramp service workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Lent, Association of Flight Attendants, AFL-CIO Master  
Executive Council president, did not release specifics of the deal, 
which covers nearly 2,000 attendants at the regional carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company agreed to improve the 401(k) retirement  
savings plan. Earlier, Lent had noted improvements in work rules 
and scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline president Bill Ayer said negotiators deserve credit for  
sticking to an ``interest-based bargaining process,'' a 
problem-solving method that produced agreement in little more than 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a model for how agreements can and should be reached --  
collaboratively and within a reasonable time frame,'' he said. 
``That benefits both parties and, in turn, allows all of us to 
focus 100 percent on service to our customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cordiality contrasted with a bitter situation four years  
ago, when the flight attendants union carried out a rolling strike 
as talks dragged on for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska Airlines chairman John Kelly had told shareholders in May  
that labor peace was his top priority this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than a week later, Alaska reached agreement on a 42-month  
contract with Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association Local 14, 
which represents more than 1,000 mechanics. That pact came after 
weeks of flight cancellations, the firing of six employees accused 
of instigating sickouts and the filing of a federal lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The mechanics ratified the deal in June.  
</P>
<P>
	A group of 3,270 customer service agents and accounting clerks  
represented by the International Association of Machinists and 
Aerospace Workers reached a tentative agreement with Alaska last 
month, airline spokesman Lou Cancelmi said. He added a final vote 
is expected by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Still in dispute is a contract for 975 ramp service agents and  
stock clerks represented by the Machinists union. Cancelmi said a 
federal mediator is involved in those talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska Airlines, part of Alaska Air Group, serves more than 40  
cities in Alaska, Canada, Mexico and five Western states.

<HEADLINE> IBM Pulls PCs Out of U.S. Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Big Blue is giving itself the Big Boot.  
</P>
<P>
	IBM, whose name has been synonymous with personal computers for  
two decades, said Tuesday it is pulling its money-losing line of 
PCs from retail stores in the United States and will sell them 
exclusively over the Internet in a drastic move to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Aptiva PCs will disappear from shelves starting Jan. 1. IBM's  
ThinkPad laptops, which are profitable, will continue to be 
available in stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The retreat underscores the enormous pressure facing the  
nation's third-largest PC maker. IBM's Personal Systems Group, 
which sells PCs to both consumers and businesses, lost about $150 
million in the second quarter and nearly $1 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	By withdrawing its PCs from about 70 U.S. retail chains, IBM  
saves on the fees stores typically charge to display and stock 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to restore this business to profitability,'' IBM  
spokeswoman Trink Guarino said. Moving out of stores ``will save us 
a lot of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To buoy awareness of the Aptiva brand and encourage people to  
visit its ShopIBM Web site, which it is redesigning, IBM plans to 
launch a $20 million advertising campaign early next year that will 
include television and direct mail. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, a one-time PC pioneer, is the latest technology company to  
be squeezed by price wars and a surge in component costs. Dell 
Computer Corp. warned on Monday its third-quarter profits will be 
hurt by rising chip prices stemming from the Taiwan earthquake last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM is expected to report its third-quarter financial results on  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's move comes two weeks after it started cutting 500 to 1,000  
employees from its PC business as it consolidates several brands 
under one marketing umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
	The retreat by IBM is a stunning reversal from its launch of the  
first home computer in the early 1980s, when it started selling an 
affordable box-like device that sat on people's desks. Even though 
IBM was overtaken by sellers of cheaper PCs, such as Compaq 
Computer Corp., home machines became widely known as ``IBM 
clones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To differentiate its products, IBM introduced the Aptiva in  
1994. But IBM reacted sluggishly in 1997 to a profound shift in 
consumer buying behavior -- PCs that cost less than $1,000. After 
finally tagging on, IBM subsequently shied away from this year's 
hot budget item: home PCs under $600, which accounted for nearly 
half of all store sales this past August. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say IBM, which makes many of its own computer parts,  
has difficulty keeping down costs in contrast to rivals that buy 
more heavily from cheaper outside suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	``IBM has always wanted to stay away from the low end,'' said  
Matt Sargent, an analyst with the ZD InfoBeads research firm, based 
in La Jolla, Calif. ``They just aren't as low cost a producer'' as 
some rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's move to eliminate store sales takes its cue from Dell and  
Gateway Inc., the two largest direct sellers of PCs to customers. 
By eliminating wholesalers and retailers, the companies have shaved 
costs, created customer loyalty and prompted competitors to become 
copycats. 
</P>
<P>
	But IBM has a tough task ahead of it.  
</P>
<P>
	Dell sells mostly business PCs to corporate customers, a more  
tech-savvy group that generally knows what type of computers to 
buy. Home computer users are more of a ``kick-the-tire'' crowd, 
preferring to try out a PC before buying it. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Gateway sells most of its computers to home users, it  
operates its own ``Country Store'' outlets to help walk consumers 
through the buying process. A survey early this year by ZD 
InfoBeads found that 41 percent of consumers who bought an IBM 
Aptiva would consider buying a Gateway as their next computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, IBM's Web destination is considered harder to navigate  
than online sites from Dell and Gateway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think IBM's move to direct is a mistake,'' Sargent  
said. ``I just don't think IBM is going to make the transition (to 
online sales) well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's stock was up 12 1/2 cents a share at $107.12 1/2 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Martha Stewart Stock Soars on Day 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Martha Stewart got a warm welcome today as  
shares in her company nearly tripled in value in debut trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc., which  
specializes in how-to information for consumers, opened at $37.25. 
They quickly shot to $52 a share before dropping back to the 
mid-$40 range by late morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, a paragon of genteel living, was competing for investor  
attention with the World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc., 
which was also expected to begin selling stock today. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial public offerings of stock, or IPOs, were eagerly  
awaited because both companies have heavy media involvement and 
have been making inroads in online marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Martha Stewart Living shares were priced late yesterday at $18,  
at the top of the revised $16-to-$18 range announced earlier in the 
day. The shares initially had been expected to sell in a range of 
$13 to $15. 
</P>
<P>
	The IPO involves 7.2 million shares of common stock, which are  
trading under the symbol MSO. Martha Stewart Living granted its 
underwriters options to buy 1.1 million additional shares to cover 
over-allotments. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the initial public offering of 10 million common  
shares of World Wrestling common stock was priced at $17 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	World Wrestling shares, using the code WWFE, were expected to  
begin trading later in the day on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
Underwriters for World Wrestling were led by Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The Martha Stewart Living offering is being managed by Morgan  
Stanley Dean Witter, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Bear Stearns, Donaldson, 
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette and Banc of America Securities LLC. 
</P>
<P>
	In its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in  
July, Martha Stewart Living said it planned to use proceeds from 
the offering to repurchase shares held by Time Publishing Ventures 
Inc. and for business development.

<HEADLINE> Babbitt Opposes Utah Bill Provision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A proposal covering close to 1.1 million acres  
of wilderness in Utah's western desert would give the Air Force too 
much control over areas used for training flights, Interior 
Secretary Bruce Babbitt told a House panel Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt said he supports the proposed boundaries of 31 new  
wilderness areas in the bill sponsored by Rep. Jim Hansen, R-Utah. 
But he said he could not support the overall bill because of the 
military flights language and several other provisions that Babbitt 
said would allow too much human intrusion on wild areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen's bill would permit unlimited military training flights  
above wilderness areas at altitudes as low as 10 feet and allow the 
Air Force to close areas to the public ``when required by national 
security or public safety.'' Hansen and other supporters said Air 
Force officials requested the provisions to safeguard activities at 
Hill Air Force Base and the Utah Test and Training Range. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how we're going to train'' without such rules,  
Hansen said. ``This has got to have as few restrictions (on 
military flights) as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt said the Interior Department currently manages the areas  
as if they were wilderness, without the closure provisions, and the 
Air Force has not objected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It goes way beyond anything the Air Force has ever demanded,''  
Babbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said, however, he does not want Hansen's bill killed.  
</P>
<P>
	Some environmental and natural resources groups oppose the plan,  
which Hansen said is ``a work in progress.'' He said he plans to 
work on its language to try and accommodate Babbitt and other 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
	The wilderness designation bans logging, mining, vehicle use and  
new construction. Wilderness areas are thus among the federal lands 
with the most restrictions on their use. 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen's bill also would preclude that wilderness designation  
for hundreds of thousands of acres in Utah that had been considered 
for protection.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Offer Anti-Poverty Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore wants to make better  
fathers out of men with a series of campaign proposals, including a 
measure urging credit card companies to deny credit to those he 
calls ``dead-broke dads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's ``responsible fatherhood'' package will be unveiled at a  
Washington church Wednesday, the day before Bill Bradley, his sole 
rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, delivers a major 
address on child poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president is making a habit of pre-empting Bradley's  
speeches. Days before the former New Jersey senator unveiled an 
ambitious and expensive plan to provide universal health care, Gore 
rushed together a more limited health care plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``This certainly suggests that the vice president agrees with  
our agenda,'' Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said. ``But in the end 
the depth and significance of our proposals to solve big problems 
is far greater than his.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Chris Lehane fired back with a reference to  
Bradley's vote in the Senate in favor of President Reagan's 1981 
spending cuts. ``Al Gore's interest and commitment to strengthening 
families dates back long before he became interested in running for 
president, back to 1981 when he stayed and fought against the 
Reagan budget cuts that devastated programs for working families 
and the poor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a poll released Tuesday showed Gore and Bradley in a  
close race in Iowa, where precinct caucuses launch the presidential 
nominating season in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was favored by 43 percent of the voters questioned, to  
Bradley's 40 percent, with 17 percent undecided. The survey of 617 
people who said they regularly vote in state elections was 
commissioned by KCCI, a Des Moines, Iowa, television station. It 
claimed a margin of error of plus or minus 6 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's campaign has gained ground in polls across the  
country, including in Iowa. A survey last month had him within 12 
points of the vice president in the state, where Gore generally had 
been given an edge because of his backing from the party 
establishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore planned to address the poverty problem with a series of  
proposals focused on fathers who can't afford to pay child support. 
They are aimed primarily at men on welfare and offer incentives for 
them to find work, said a supporter who had been briefed on the 
package. 
</P>
<P>
	The supporter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the  
package includes measures to: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Provide credit card companies with government data on fathers  
who have not paid child support. The companies would be urged to 
deny credit to anyone on the lists. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Promote marriage by reducing the tax penalty paid by married  
couples. Gore wants to raise the standard deduction for married 
couples by $1,400 and allow married couples earning up to $29,000 
to receive the Earned Income Tax Credit. The supporter said the 
E.I.T.C. threshold currently is lower, forcing couples to accept a 
tax increase or avoid marriage. Gore proposed a similar measure in 
July as part of his middle-class tax package. 
</P>
<P>
	The supporter said Gore will cite government data showing that  
more than one-third of American children live apart from their 
biological fathers, a growing trend that tends to perpetuate child 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Jones, president of Baltimore's Center for Fathers, Families  
and Workforce Development, described the services as ``tough love, 
in-your-face job training and readiness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at ways to make the distinction between deadbeat  
and dead broke. If you're a low-income parent with little education 
and no job, we've got to take that into account as we put together 
these child support orders,'' said Jones, who is scheduled to 
participate in the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, one of the many people consulted by Gore to prepare for  
the announcement, said of the credit card proposal: ``If somebody 
doesn't pay, you need to do things to bring them to the table in 
terms of their accountability and responsibility. We need to make 
sure there are mechanisms in place to get the resources to the 
children.''

	Stocks End Mixed; Dow Up 88.65  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks rose today after a report of  
moderate inflation calmed investor fears about higher interest 
rates, but the renewed optimism failed to lift technology stocks, 
which slumped following a profit warning from Dell. At the close of 
trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 
88.65 at 10,204.93, extending its gain of 96.57 on Monday. The 
index had fallen back from an earlier gain of 219 points. Broader 
stock indicators were mixed. The technology-dominated Nasdaq 
composite index finished with a slight loss -- down 0.89 to 
2,688.26.

	Consumer Prices Jump 0.4 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inflation at the consumer level jumped 0.4  
percent in September, the biggest increase in five months, 
reflecting sharply higher prices for gasoline, cigarettes and 
clothing. The Labor Department said last month's increase in the 
Consumer Price Index, the government's most closely watched 
inflation gauge, followed a 0.3 percent rise in August. The rise 
was in line with expectations. But rising worries about inflation 
have set off alarm bells on Wall Street with investors concerned 
that the Federal Reserve will be forced to raise interest rates 
again at their Nov. 16 meeting. 

</P>
<P>
	Housing Starts Fall 3.2 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In another report today, the Commerce  
Department said that construction on new homes and apartments fell 
by 3.2 percent in September, the second monthly decline, as the 
impact of rising mortgage rates and Hurricane Floyd dampened 
activity. The decline announced by the Commerce Department was 
bigger than had been expected. Housing construction fell to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.62 million units following a 
revised 0.5 percent drop in August.

	Drug Companies Report Big Earnings

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three drug companies today reported double-digit  
earnings growth for the third quarter as demand for pharmaceuticals 
increased around the world. Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Pfizer beat 
analysts' forecasts, while Bristol-Myers Squibb matched 
expectations. Johnson &AMP; Johnson's earnings rose 14.4 percent with 
profit of $1.1 billion or 80 cents per share, up from $961 million, 
or 70 cents per share, a year ago. Pfizer Inc., excluding one-time 
events, had third quarter earnings up 36 percent to $906 million, 
or 23 cents per share. Bristol-Myers Squibb's earnings rose 14 
percent to $1.10 billion, or 54 cents per share.

	Wells Fargo Posts Record Profits  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Wells Fargo &AMP; Company today reported a 30  
percent increase in third-quarter profits as the banking and 
investment company continued to combine systems following its 
merger with Norwest Corp. Wells Fargo, the nation's seventh-largest 
bank, posted net income of $962 million, or 57 cents a share, 
matching analysts' estimate. The San Francisco-based bank earned 
$742 million or 45 cents a share. 

</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Profits Rise 30 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Continued strong demand for Microsoft Corp.'s  
Office 2000 and other business software helped the company to a 30 
percent increase in profits for the first quarter. Microsoft 
reported net earnings of $2.19 billion or 40 cents a share for the 
quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with profits of $1.68 billion or 
31 cents a share a year earlier. Revenues rose 28 percent, from 
$4.19 billion to $5.38 billion, the company said today. The figures 
easily outpaced analysts estimate of 34 cents a share. Microsoft 
stock was down 1 9/16 at 86 5/16.

	IBM Changes Aptiva PC Sale Strategy  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM, whose name has been synonymous with  
personal computers for nearly two decades, is pulling its 
money-losing line of PCs from retail stores in the United States 
and will sell them exclusively over the Internet, in a drastic move 
to cut costs. Aptiva PCs will disappear from stores starting Jan. 
1, an IBM spokeswoman said today. IBM, the nation's third-largest 
PC maker, is the latest technology company to get squeezed by 
intense price wars and a surge in component costs. 

</P>
<P>
	Northwest, America West Earnings Up  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Northwest Airlines reported its third-quarter  
earnings were hurt by higher fuel prices while Southwest Airlines 
said its profits dropped because of rising fuel costs and due to 
flight cancellations from Hurricane Floyd. Meanwhile, America West, 
which also reported earnings today, said its profits rose 1.5 
percent. Northwest reported profits of $180 million, or $1.96 per 
share, compared with a $224 million, or $2.91 per share, 
strike-related loss last year, but said high fuel prices and excess 
capacity throughout the industry cut into earnings. Southwest 
reported a 2.3 percent drop in net earnings to $127 million, or 24 
cents a share. America West Holdings Corp., parent of America West, 
announced third-quarter earnings of $22.2 million, or 57 cents per 
share, a 1.5 percent increase over last year.

the public for the first time. Shares in Martha Stewart Living 
Omnimedia Inc., which specializes in how-to information for

Exchange before giving up a little of its gains. Also making a 
strong debut was World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc., 
known for its outrageous ring theatrics, which more than doubled on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market before slipping back a bit. Martha Stewart 
Living shares were priced late yesterday at $18. It rose 20 1/2 to 38 1/2

shares of World Wrestling common stock was priced at $17 a share. 
It was up 8 1/4 to 25 1/4 today.

<HEADLINE> Yanks Mum on World Series Opponent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- To a man, they swear it doesn't matter.  
</P>
<P>
	And to a man, the New York Yankees are lying.  
</P>
<P>
	If they really had any say over the draw for this weekend's  
World Series, you know which team that would be? 
</P>
<P>
	Not the Mets or the Braves, but the Bad News Bears -- and even  
better if it happened to be the week Walter Matthau was laid up 
with gout and Tatum O'Neal was under house arrest for trying to set 
the family pet on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	But since the Bears aren't an option, ask any of the  
just-crowned American League champs to choose their NL counterparts 
and watch their brains lock on autopilot. 
</P>
<P>
	After beating Boston 6-1 Monday night, the Yankees are headed  
for their third World Series in four seasons. And apparently the 
fear of saying something that could wind up on an opponent's 
bulletin board has become so great that everybody in the 
organization has learned to say nothing instead. Just broaching the 
subject is like asking to be dropped into the middle of a video of 
``The Stepford Wives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owner George Steinbrenner: ``A New York series would be great,  
but I don't want to offend any of my friends in Atlanta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Joe Torre: ``Whatever way it goes, it goes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher Andy Pettitte: ``Once you get there, it doesn't matter  
who you play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First baseman Tino Martinez: ``The best team will get there  
either way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre: ``I could care less.''  
</P>
<P>
	Batting coach Chris Chambliss: ``Put me down for the same  
answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But scratch the surface and there is no doubt who New York is  
pulling for: 
</P>
<P>
	New York.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah,'' Steinbrenner allowed, ``if the owners of the team we  
wind up playing just happen to be (New Yorkers Fred) Wilpon and 
(Nelson) Doubleday, I wouldn't be mad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What the Mets have done the last couple of weeks,'' Torre said  
admiringly, ``has enabled them to walk with pride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd go all the way to Japan to play in the World Series,''  
Martinez said, ``but sure, sleeping in my own bed for the whole 
Series would be a nice touch. And I got some close pals on the 
Mets. Playing them would be a kick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, a Subway Series would be great, perhaps more than anybody  
who doesn't live there can appreciate. And so just in case it comes 
to pass, here is a primer to help tell one New York team from the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Yankees, it's the manager who doesn't like to talk and  
the owner who won't shut up. 
</P>
<P>
	Over at the Mets, it's the other way around.  
</P>
<P>
	Yankee Stadium has been called baseball's temple, with good  
reason. Behind the left-field wall, there's Monument Park, a shrine 
to some of the greatest players (all Yankees) the game has known. 
On any night, former opera star Robert Merrill might show up and 
sing the national anthem. Public address announcer Bob Sheppard's 
dulcet tones have been described as ``the voice of God'' -- only a 
slight exaggeration. The best seat in the house for a 
regular-season game will set you back $197.53. 
</P>
<P>
	Shea Stadium sits atop a landfill off Flushing Bay. Jets roar  
overhead with numbing regularity. And if you bring an empty Pepsi 
can along, admission to the bleachers is free some nights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees attract the glamorous, hip and powerful. They  
schmooze, they pose, they've never met a photo-op they didn't have 
time for. They are not above cementing business and political 
relationships in the middle of the most furious rallies. Mayor Rudy 
Guiliani is a Yankees fan. So are First Lady Rodham Clinton, 
comedians Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld, filmmaker Spike Lee and 
Donald Trump. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher, on the other hand, is a Mets fan.  
</P>
<P>
	The unkindest cut ever made by the Yankees was Steinbrenner's  
ban on facial hair. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Mets, it was pitcher Bob Ojeda, who lopped off part of a  
finger on his pitching hand while trimming the hedges around his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees made pinstripes in sports famous. They continue to  
protect the brand by only wearing the uniforms for home games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets have no idea which of their four different uniform  
shirts they'll be wearing -- white, gray, black or pinstripes -- 
until the clubhouse attendants lay them out. After being thrown out 
of a game, manager Bobby Valentine confused matters further this 
past June by changing his shirt, then donning glasses and a fake 
mustache so he could return to the Mets dugout incognito. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't work. Valentine was found out, fined $5,000 and  
suspended for two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Only in New York, New York.

<HEADLINE> FCC Proposes Fine Against Qwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission proposed  
$2 million in fines Tuesday against Qwest Communications 
International Inc., accusing the company of switching long-distance 
service without subscribers' consent. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC charged the Denver-based Qwest with illegally switching  
telephone service for 30 consumers without their authorization -- a 
practice known as ``slamming.'' The proposed fines are based on 
customer complaints, 22 of them in cases involving apparent forgery 
or falsified letters of authorization to switch service. 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, according to the FCC, a man reported having his  
long-distance service switched with a ``signed'' authorization by 
his dog. For privacy reasons, the phone was listed in the local 
telephone directory under the dog's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, after Alda Hodgson learned from AT&AMP;T, her  
long-distance carrier, that she had been switched to another 
company, she received a letter addressed to her husband from Qwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodgson called Qwest to inform the company her husband could not  
have authorized the service to be switched: He had been dead for 7 1/2 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how all this happened,'' Hodgson said from her  
home near Riverside, Calif. She eventually had the charges removed, 
and her subscription was returned to AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission found in the other eight complaints that Qwest  
apparently had switched subscribers' long-distance carriers without 
proper authorization, in some cases failing to verify that consent 
was given. 
</P>
<P>
	Under commission rules, a carrier must have authorization to  
switch a subscriber's phone service. This can be given by a signed 
written form or orally if verified by an independent third party. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest has 30 days to pay the fines or show why it should not  
have to. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said in a statement it would work with the FCC to  
evaluate each complaint and would contact each of the customers who 
are part of the filing. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we conclude that there was any wrongdoing, the agents  
responsible will be terminated,'' Qwest said. The company also said 
it has implemented new technologies to help track and verify 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaints involve slamming allegations against both Qwest  
and LCI International Telecom Corp., acquired by Qwest a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC has received almost 1,200 written complaints alleging  
slamming by the two companies between Sept. 1, 1998, and Aug. 31, 
1999. During the same time, the commission received 1,360 calls 
from telephone customers with similar complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Slamming represents the largest area of telephone-related  
complaints at the FCC. The commission has proposed $13 million in 
fines in the past year in connection with the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the FCC adopted rules that give telephone customers  
broader remedies for slamming, including a 30-day period in which 
they can avoid paying long-distance charges to allow time to 
resolve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  
indefinitely halted enforcement of the rules at the request of 
long-distance companies, who want the FCC to consider an industry 
plan.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Push Forward; Dow Up 165.27 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were sharply higher today after a key  
inflation report showed prices at the consumer level aren't rising 
any faster than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 165.27 at 10,281.55, extending its gain of 96.57 on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 18.69 at 1,272.82, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was up 28.12 at 2,717.27. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks soared after the Labor Department said its Consumer Price  
Index, the government's most closely watched inflation gauge, 
jumped 0.4 percent in September. That was the biggest increase in 
five months, but it was in line with Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	A persistent fear that inflation is on the rise has sent stocks  
plunging in recent weeks, driving the Dow 10.7 percent below its 
Aug. 25 record close. Investors fear rising inflation will prompt 
the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the third time this 
year in a bid to slow economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	While the report is unlikely to prevent the Fed from raising  
rates, analysts were heartened by components of the report that 
suggested inflation remains under control. Outside of the volatile 
food and energy sectors, prices were up 0.3 percent, leaving the 
so-called core rate of inflation rising at a much more moderate 1.9 
percent so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also reassured by a report from the Commerce  
Department that showed construction on new homes and apartments 
fell by 3.2 percent in September, the second monthly decline. 
Analysts said rising mortgage rates and Hurricane Floyd slowed 
building activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank and financial stocks rose today, benefiting from the calmer  
interest-rate environment. American Express gained 3 13/16 to 141 
11/16, and Bank of America rose 4 1/4 to 53 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong corporate earnings reports added to the market's  
strength. Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 4 5/8 to 99 1/8 after reporting earnings 
that beat analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The market's rise provided a welcoming environment for two  
initial public offerings. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, which 
includes Stewart's media ventures as well as the consumer products 
sold under her name, were priced at 18 and opened at 37 1/4, then rose 
to 39 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc. made a more muted  
debut. Its shares were priced at 17 and opened at 30 1/2, then settled 
back to 25 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell provided one blemish on the market today, falling 3 1/4 to 38  
1/16. The nation's largest direct seller of computers said late 
Monday a surge in the price of computer memory chips will likely 
hurt its third-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 9-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 616.79 million 
shares, ahead of Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.60 to 413.50.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Endorses U.S. Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Prime Minister Hun Sen endorsed a  
U.S. initiative today meant to salvage U.N. involvement in a 
genocide trial of Cambodia's former Khmer Rouge leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. proposal is for a tribunal with three Cambodian judges  
and two U.N.-appointed judges. At least one of the U.N.-appointed 
judges would have to agree with any verdict passed by the tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have agreed to this proposal, so the trial of the Khmer  
Rouge is no longer a concern for us, nor for the United Nations, 
nor anybody else,'' Hun Sen said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. diplomats welcomed the prime minister's decision, but it  
was not clear if it has been officially presented to U.N. 
negotiators in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident an agreement can be reached which would lead to  
a tribunal in which international standards of justice, fairness 
and due process of law are guaranteed,'' said Thomas Hammarberg, 
the U.N. special envoy for human rights to Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
	The apparent breakthrough comes after months of stalled  
negotiations on a tribunal to judge Khmer Rouge leaders in the 
deaths of 1.7 million Cambodians in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire Cambodian population was forced into farming  
collectives by the Khmer Rouge in a radical attempt to create an 
agrarian utopia. About one in five Cambodians perished from 
starvation, disease and bloody purges of suspected political 
enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations had wanted a majority of international judges  
because of concerns that the Cambodian judiciary was open to 
political interference. Cambodia had objected to a loss of 
sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the National Assembly, Prince Norodom  
Ranariddh, said today that Hun Sen agreed to three of four points 
in the U.S. memo during a meeting with U.S. Ambassador Kent 
Weidemann last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems there will be five judges; two foreign and three  
Cambodian. But a ruling can only be passed by four judges,'' the 
prince said. 
</P>
<P>
	Diplomats say the U.S. memo also suggested that a special  
chamber could be created within Cambodia's judicial system, giving 
the tribunal its own appellate system, as desired by the United 
Nations, while technically remaining a Cambodian court. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurisdiction could be narrowed to only the top leadership of the  
Khmer Rouge during the guerrillas' 1975-79 rule of Cambodia, 
diplomats said.

<HEADLINE> EgyptAir Plane Hijacked in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- A hijacker commandeered an EgyptAir  
plane with at least 47 people aboard shortly after takeoff from 
Istanbul's Ataturk airport Tuesday, according to news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anatolia news agency said the plane, which had been destined  
for Cairo, was diverted to London. 
</P>
<P>
	A lone man armed with a knife seized control of the plane  
shortly after it took off at 6:16 p.m, Anatolia and NTV television 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The motive for the hijacking was not known.  
</P>
<P>
	The NTV television report said the man first demanded to be  
taken to Hamburg, Germany, then ordered the plane diverted to 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	Anatolia said there were 47 passengers aboard the Boeing  
737-500; NTV put the number of passengers at 48 and said there were 
six crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	Three planes have been hijacked in Turkey over the past year.  
Authorities claimed security was beefed up at airports as a result.

<HEADLINE> Women Accused of Torturing Housemate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRMONT, W.Va. (AP) -- Two women who took in a homeless man are  
accused of beating him and scalding him with water. 
</P>
<P>
	Juanita Allen, 42, and Shirley Cecil, 52, were arrested Monday  
on charges of kidnapping and malicious wounding. Both were in jail 
Tuesday in lieu of $150,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
	Their alleged victim, Robert Brenneman, was hospitalized in fair  
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Brenneman, 32, had previously lived in the house Allen and Cecil  
were renting and went there asking to move back in about six weeks 
ago, said police Det. Lt. Steve Cain. 
</P>
<P>
	``They allowed him to come back and stay, and at some point,  
they got mad at him,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The women tied Brenneman up in the basement about three weeks  
ago, then spent 10 days beating and scalding him, Cain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, they drove him to Morgantown and dumped him on  
the street, where a passer-by found him Saturday and called an 
ambulance.

<HEADLINE> EU Cautious on Anti-Doping Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union expressed cautious  
support Tuesday for the proposed world anti-doping agency, but 
insisted the International Olympic Committee must not be allowed to 
dominate the new body. 
</P>
<P>
	Viviane Reding, the EU's new sports commissioner, said she will  
meet soon with IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and sports 
ministers from the 15 EU nations to discuss the project. 
</P>
<P>
	``Important questions remain to be settled regarding (the  
agency's) status and its rules of operation,'' Reding said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said it plans to set up the agency by the end of the  
month and have it fully operational by the end of the year. The 
agency will coordinate drug testing around the world, including 
out-of-competition controls. 
</P>
<P>
	But the plan has run into criticism, notably from U.S.  
government drug policy adviser Barry McCaffrey, who wants the 
agency fully independent from the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Reding said the European Commission had ``a clear willingness''  
to accept Samaranch's invitation to participate in the new agency, 
but added the EU executive arm insisted the IOC should not take a 
lead role in the new body. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want an agency that does not depend on the IOC,'' she told  
a news conference at EU headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is allocating $25 million to set up the agency.  
</P>
<P>
	Reding said the anti-doping agency would top the agenda at an  
Oct. 25 meeting of EU sports ministers in Helsinki, Finland, and a 
meeting she planned Nov. 2 with Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU wants the board of the agency to be composed equally of  
representatives from sports federations and public authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agency should be genuinely transparent and independent,''  
the EU Commission said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey, the White House drug czar, attacked the IOC's project  
as lacking openness, accountability and independence, and 
maintaining ``the Byzantine elements of the current IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reding acknowledged that U.S. opposition would be the ``biggest  
problem'' in setting up the world agency and she blasted American 
attitudes toward doping. 
</P>
<P>
	``The perception is different in the U.S. where you can buy  
doping products in the supermarket,'' she said, adding, ``I'm 
exaggerating a little, but it's almost like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reding said the IOC's plan to locate the agency near its  
headquarters in the Swiss city of Lausanne could only be a 
temporary solution. A number of EU nations including Spain, 
Portugal, Austria and Sweden have offered to host the new body.

<HEADLINE> Jets' Williams in Intensive Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kevin Williams of the New York Jets is  
hospitalized in an intensive care unit and on a respirator for an 
ailment originally diagnosed as strep throat. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old defensive back has an unspecified infection of  
the throat and lungs. He has been sedated for most of this week and 
has undergone three surgical procedures to clear fluid from his 
throat and around his lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	Lenox Hill Hospital has honored a family request to withhold  
information on Williams' condition. The Jets will not elaborate 
until coach Bill Parcells meets with the media Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' mother and other family members traveled from Arkansas  
last week to be with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe he's listed in guarded condition, but I have not  
been able to speak to him in four days,'' said Jerome Stanley, 
Williams' agent. ``He's in a sedated state and not able to talk or 
communicate. He's not conscious more than 10 minutes at a time and 
has been on a heart monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doctors are concerned about a virus penetrating the organs,  
the heart, then they wouldn't know what to do. That was what caused 
the red alert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams had been in and out of the hospital for two weeks. Jets  
team doctor Elliott Pellman has been updated daily by the hospital. 
Williams also has been examined by a heart specialist and an 
infectious disease physician. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very, very sick young man,'' Parcells said.  
</P>
<P>
	The team advised Williams' teammates not to visit.  
</P>
<P>
	``They told us it wouldn't be wise to go see him,'' Aaron Glenn  
said. ``He's having trouble breathing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley said he is upset the organization has not contacted  
Williams' family. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not a job or business in America that would treat an  
employee like this. Nobody offered the family any communication or 
anything,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley also said the Jets placed Williams on the reserve,  
nonfootball injury list so they wouldn't be required to continue 
paying him. 
</P>
<P>
	The agent believes Williams' condition was exacerbated by his  
returning to the lineup for a game in Denver on Oct. 3 and should 
be on injured reserve. On that list, teams must pay a player's full 
salary when he is sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have talked to medical people,'' Stanley said, ``and the  
fact it had become so difficult to diagnose was a direct result of 
playing in the high altitude in Denver. This is not a nonfootball 
related situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the team, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said the Jets still were paying Williams, although the source was 
not certain if it was his full salary. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets are known as an organization that does not abandon its  
players. When Dennis Byrd was partially paralyzed in 1992, the team 
paid his medical bills even after he retired.

<HEADLINE> Accords, Camrys Big With Thieves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- High-end light trucks joined Honda Accords and  
Toyota Camrys as the most common vehicles disappearing from owners' 
clutches last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Insurance Crime Bureau's latest list Monday showed  
that Accords and Camrys remained thieves' most popular targets, 
followed by the Chevrolet C/K pickup truck, Jeep Cherokee/Grand 
Cherokee sport utility vehicles, Honda Civic, Oldsmobile Cutlass, 
Ford F-series pickup, Ford Mustang, Dodge Caravan and Toyota 
Corolla. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chevrolet C/K jumped four spots in the list to third,  
Cherokee/Grand Cherokees five places to fourth, and Ford F-series 
pickups three notches to seventh in rankings mirroring the shifts 
in taste on America's highways. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vehicle thieves follow market trends and target the most  
popular vehicles because they provide the best market for stolen 
vehicle parts,'' the bureau's Ed Sparkman said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Wes Brown of the Nextrend market research firm agreed,  
but pointed to something perhaps simpler: vanity among both 
motorists and those stealing from them. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at SUVs and some pickup models, we're a society  
much more concerned about self-image. How you look in a vehicle is 
much more important in our daily lives,'' he said. ``There's a 
general vainness in society, so theoretically why would criminals 
be any less likely to have it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The list is based on more than 400,000 stolen vehicle reports  
submitted to the nonprofit bureau by its member insurance companies 
nationwide. The figure represents roughly one-third of all vehicles 
reported stolen last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau combines theft reports for all model years of a  
particular make and model, unlike a similar annual list issued by 
CCC Information Services Inc. That company, which also tracks 
vehicle thefts for the insurance industry, lists the most-stolen 
vehicles by model year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the two lists feature some of the same cars. In February,  
CCC reported that the top three stolen cars in 1998 all were Camrys 
from various years, followed by the 1994 Accord EX, tops among 13 
Accords in that list's top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The lists of most-stolen vehicles usually lag sales trends by  
several years. As a popular model ages and demand for its parts 
rises, it moves up on the theft lists. The high ranking of the Olds 
Cutlass, for example, reflects the car's immense popularity in the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Buying habits in different parts of the country also are  
reflected in theft trends. American vehicles are the top targets of 
thieves in Detroit and Chicago, pickups in Houston and Phoenix. 
Japanese cars lead the list in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the FBI reported Sunday that the estimated 1.2 million  
vehicles reported stolen nationwide last year were 8 percent less 
than the previous year -- and the lowest number since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimated total value of vehicles stolen nationwide in 1998  
was nearly $7.5 billion, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NICB, based in Palos Hills, Ill., is supported by more than  
1,000 insurance companies.

<HEADLINE> Panel Wants Puerto Rico Alternative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite Navy objections, members of a  
presidential panel said today that the service should look harder 
for an alternative to its main Atlantic bombing range on the Puerto 
Rican island of Vieques. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services  
Committee said he regretted that the island had become so 
politicized. Sen. John Warner, R-Va., cited Hillary Rodham 
Clinton's comments calling for an immediate and permanent end to 
the use of the island as a target range. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that many Americans live close to military practice  
ranges, Warner said: ``I wonder what the first lady would have to 
say about the rest of the portions of the United States of America 
that do accept this as their contribution towards national 
security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francis Rush, the chairman of the presidential panel, defended  
the group's conclusion that bombing should be allowed to resume on 
the island, but at a reduced level -- and that the range should be 
closed entirely within five years. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Rush conceded that as of now ``there are no  
potential sites'' that appear to meet the Navy's requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy's five-decade long use of the island for live bombing  
practice came under new political scrutiny after a security guard 
was killed and four others injured April 19 when an F-18 fighter 
accidentally dropped two 500-pound bombs on the wrong target. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has continued to be bombs away, day after day,'' Puerto  
Rican Gov. Pedro Rosselo told the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
``The death of a young Vieques resident last April brought the 
situation to a point of no return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He accused the Navy of being ``supremely callous, condescending  
and ultimately inhumane'' in its conduct on the small island of 
9,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy has said it will search anew for alternatives, but that  
for the next five years the range is irreplaceable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Vieques Training Range ... is the best, and for several  
important activities the only suitable training site for naval 
forces deploying from the East Coast of the United States,'' Navy 
Secretary Richard Danzig said in prepared testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Danzig insisted that the range had a good safety record. ``The  
very regrettable death of a Navy employee on the range six months 
ago does not demonstrate otherwise,'' Danzig said. ``This is the 
only civilian death on the range in more than 55 years of 
training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Marine Gen. Richard Neal, a member of the presidential  
panel, said the Navy had done ``a lousy job of communication'' with 
residents of the Vieques and in dealing with Puerto Rico in 
general. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought this (report) would get the Navy off its butt,  
quite frankly,'' Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration imposed a temporary moratorium on  
live-fire training at Vieques as it searches for middle ground in 
the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. territory's government is adamant that the Navy abandon  
the range, but the Navy says U.S. national security is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidential panel issued its report Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Ricans raise a host of environmental, health and other  
objections to bombing on Vieques, a 20-mile-long island off the 
eastern end of Puerto Rico. The island's approximately 9,300 people 
are separated from the bombing range at its eastern tip by a buffer 
zone of about 10 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also faulted the Navy for failing to meet earlier  
commitments to boost Vieques' economic development. It accused the 
Navy of being insensitive to local complaints about noise and other 
inconveniences, which have been a sore point among Puerto Ricans 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
	After release of the presidential panel's report, Defense  
Secretary William Cohen said he would withhold his recommendation 
to President Clinton until the panel held more discussions on a 
Vieques solution. Until Cohen acts, the Navy apparently will 
continue its moratorium on live-fire training on the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's report drew immediate protests in Puerto Rico, where  
sentiment against the Navy has been growing since a civilian 
security guard was killed in an April bombing accident. Protesters 
have camped out on the bombing range since then to prevent the Navy 
from using the range. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a way to give the Navy time to find allies,''  
said Carlos Ventura, president of the Fishermen's Association of 
Southern Vieques, which has set up a protest camp on the range. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, it is unacceptable that the Navy start exercises  
again,'' Ventura said. ``We are going to stay there and continue 
our civil disobedience. They will have to arrest us, and when that 
happens there will be many more people who will come out and join 
us.''

Tennessee in four years, the Crimson Tide's longest drought in the 
81 years since the series started. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama, ranked 10th, couldn't care less what kind of streaks  
are on the line when it plays No. 5 Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of us worry about the records or streaks, this is about  
Alabama red versus Tennessee orange,'' tailback Shaun Alexander 
said Monday. ``And hopefully at the end, Alabama is standing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preseason predictions said it was unlikely Alabama (5-1, 4-0  
Southeastern Conference) would beat Tennessee this year. But the 
predictions also said a win over Florida was out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, the Tide has already knocked off Florida. Now, beating  
Tennessee doesn't sound so farfetched. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone believed we could beat the big teams,''  
quarterback Andrew Zow said. ``People seemed to think we could win 
nine games this year, but they assumed we'd lose to Florida and 
Tennessee. Well, we beat Florida and people are now starting to 
take us seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trick to proving the critics wrong was simply not listening  
to them, coach Mike DuBose said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had enough to do with just trying to keep the football team  
focused that we didn't get caught up in all that,'' DuBose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Alabama plugged away at its schedule. There have been  
three straight wins over ranked teams, the first three-game winning 
streak under DuBose, and Alabama cracked the Top Ten for the first 
time since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we feel like we can play with anyone in the  
nation,'' guard Griff Redmill said. ``We have such a high 
confidence level right now, we feel like we can win out our 
schedule and play with anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tide gets a shot at the defending national champions this  
week, in a game played in Tuscaloosa for the first time in 60 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for three previous games, Alabama always played the Vols  
at Legion Field in Birmingham. The school spent more than $1 
million this winter to move all its SEC games on campus, giving the 
Tide true home field advantage, Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a whole different atmosphere here, with Bear Bryant  
talking on the Jumbotron and the students all coming to the game,'' 
he said. ``It's going to be a fun game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atmosphere won't be enough against Tennessee, though. For  
Alabama to have a shot at beating Tennessee, the Tide's defense 
will have to get better in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this season, the Tide has managed to win despite a  
defense ranked last in the SEC. Alabama allows opponents 354.2 
yards a game and is no better stopping the run then it is the pass. 
The Tide also is ranked dead last in interceptions, with two. 
</P>
<P>
	That led DuBose to shake up his secondary last week, demoting  
strong safety Marcus Spencer -- the team's leading tackler. Tony 
Dixon was moved into Spencer's spot and Reggie Myles switched from 
cornerback into Dixon's free safety spot. 
</P>
<P>
	The shakeup had some success -- Alabama held its opponent under  
300 passing yards for the first time in four games. But it won't be 
good enough against Tennessee, which has finally found an offensive 
groove. 
</P>
<P>
	After struggling offensively in games against Florida, Memphis  
and Auburn, the Vols rolled up 458 total yards in a 37-20 win over 
Georgia two weeks ago. Quarterback Tee Martin accounted for 332 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe they're the most talented team in the country,  
and they may be playing as well as any team in the country,'' 
DuBose said. ``I think they are peaking at just the right time, so 
it will be a tremendous challenge and also a tremendous 
opportunity.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Has Good Week / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Television viewers clearly enjoy seeing Alan  
Alda back beside an operating table: his appearance on ``ER'' 
boosted the medical drama's ratings and led NBC to its best week 
since Michael Jordan's final jumpshot. 
</P>
<P>
	Alda, the former M A S H surgeon, began a brief stint working in  
the emergency room of Chicago's mythical Cook County General 
Hospital on Thursday. The well-publicized appearance increased the 
``ER'' audience by 2 million people over the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	``ER'' was easily last week's most-watched show, with nearly 9  
million more viewers than its closest competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's 11.0 rating and 18 share won Nielsen Media Research's  
weekly ratings race. It was the network's biggest weekly audience 
since June 1998, when NBC covered Jordan's last games in the NBA 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Another sport -- baseball -- helped NBC last week. The New York  
Mets' 15-inning victory over the Atlanta Braves Sunday in the 
National League Championship Series was the highest-rated league 
championship game with an afternoon start since 1987, perhaps 
because it stretched to nearly 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	It enabled NBC to do well on a night that CBS normally wins, and  
postpone a TV movie on disc jockey Alan Freed that had received 
poor reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS finished second for the week with a 9.2 rating and 15 share.  
Fox, also buoyed by baseball coverage, finished third with a 7.6 
rating and 13 share and ABC had a 7.2 rating and 12 share. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB had a 3.1 rating and 5 share, improving UPN had a 2.8  
rating and 5 share and Pax TV had a 0.8 rating and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won the evening news ratings race  
with a 7.5 rating and 16 share. The ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 7.4 
rating and 16 share, while the ``CBS Evening News'' had a 6.4 
rating and 14 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Oct. 11-17, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: 
</P>
<P>
	``ER,'' NBC, 20.4; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 13.8; ``Friends,'' NBC,  
13.8; ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 12.3; ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' CBS, 12.2; ``National League Championship Series: Atlanta 
vs. N.Y. Mets,'' NBC, 12.0; ``Law and Order,'' NBC, 11.7; ``Judging 
Amy,'' CBS, 11.7; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 11.7; ``CBS Sunday Movie: 
Silk Hope,'' CBS, 11.4.

<HEADLINE> Nets Scramble To Produce Game Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For that shiny new car -- and let's throw in a  
few thousand dollars to make it interesting -- here's our final 
jackpot question: 
</P>
<P>
	Which game show will show up on prime-time network television  
within the next year? 
</P>
<P>
	a) a ``survival of the fittest'' competition with 16 people  
dumped on a tropical island in the South China Sea for weeks to see 
who can best adapt. The winner takes home $1 million -- if not a few 
exotic diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	b) a high-stakes trivia game where contestants team up to win  
prizes, only to turn against each other when the money gets really 
big -- potentially $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	c) a remake of ``Twenty-One,'' the high-stakes quiz notorious  
for puncturing a previous game show craze 31 years ago when it was 
revealed a player was fed correct answers. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news is you can't lose. Each answer is correct.  
</P>
<P>
	But with Hollywood producers in a mad rush to make game shows  
following this summer's success of ``Who Wants to Be a 
Millionaire,'' the real question is whether the craze will pay off 
for TV networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Millionaire'' will be back next month, again with Regis  
Philbin as host. It was a sensation during its late-summer run at 
ABC, captivating viewers hungry for excitement after months of 
reruns and newsmagazines. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are just so many situation comedies on the air,'' said  
Rick Ludwin, NBC senior vice president. ``I think the audience is 
sending us a signal that they are becoming a little bored with 
comedies that don't measure up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game shows are ideal for television executives: they're cheap to  
produce, can quickly fill any hole in the schedule and are new to 
many viewers, while still being a format with proven success in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	Small wonder, then, that the networks have heard dozens of  
pitches for game shows in the past two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Television is the ultimate derivative medium,'' said Nancy  
Tellem, CBS entertainment president. ``If something's working, 
you're going to have 10 like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's partly why Fox is pushing ``Greed'' on the air so quickly  
-- perhaps as soon as two weeks. Its executives worry that viewers 
will lose interest when they are inundated with game shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greed'' has the $2 million payout in a test of human nature,  
1990s style: will you fatten your own wallet at the expense of 
friends? 
</P>
<P>
	NBC is bringing back the disgraced ``Twenty-One,'' canceled in  
1958 for the scandal depicted in the movie, ``Quiz Show.'' CBS has 
an option on that show's old competitor, ``The $64,000 Question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC is also combing the archives and considering other old  
favorites, like ``Concentration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's flattering to be copied,'' said Andrea Wong, ABC's vice  
president for alternative series and specials. 
</P>
<P>
	Happy to be first, ABC is cautious about other game shows. In  
development is ``Have I Got News For You'' with Norm McDonald, 
although Wong said it's more a comedy than a game. 
</P>
<P>
	In an era of extreme sports, many of the proposals being pitched  
are extreme: variations on the idea of the lengths people will go 
to humiliate or even hurt themselves for money, executives say. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's ``Survivor'' has an element of danger, with people  
marooned on an island. A losing contestant on a Swedish show based 
on the same idea committed suicide after returning home two years 
ago. Although the show said it wasn't responsible, the player's 
widow blamed it for the death. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one other American network passed on the idea, worried  
about the potential for bad publicity if something went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Tellem concedes ``Survivor'' is riskier than putting someone on  
stage to answer questions. But she said CBS is taking particular 
care in how it selects participants and in hiring a producer 
experienced in environmental challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	Networks face the danger of repeating history if they become  
embroiled in their own game of can-you-top-this, NBC's Ludwin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This sort of escalation is one of the things that killed game  
shows in the 1950s,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The legacy of ``Millionaire'' may also convince networks that  
there's a payoff in cheaply-produced, limited-run series that can 
be aired in the summer as an alternative to reruns. For instance, 
ABC is developing its own short series for next year on how a ``boy 
band'' gets its start in the music business. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interim, though, prepare to be quizzed -- at least until  
the inevitable backlash sets in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is room for two, maybe three of this form in  
prime-time,'' Ludwin said. ``You won't see 19.''

<HEADLINE> Tonya Harding Unfazed By Rough Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) -- The boo birds were absent, replaced by  
well-wishes and hugs for Tonya Harding at her debut in professional 
skating. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite falling twice and placing fourth among five women  
entering tonight's final round of the Pro Skating Championship, 
Harding emerged with a smile and a sense of accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very glad to see everyone was supporting me,'' Harding  
said. ``It made me feel welcome. It helped me carry it through the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very nervous and my legs were shaking. I went out and  
did the best that I could after being off the ice for so long. I 
just had a great time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harding's debut came after several months of trying to persuade  
promoters to sign her. She announced her intentions to return to 
the ice in February, five years after her implication in the attack 
on rival Nancy Kerrigan, which resulted in Harding's banishment 
from amateur competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Some pros were leery of appearing on the same ice as her. Others  
came to her defense Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a friend of mine before, and I'm so glad she's back  
skating with us,'' said first-round leader Surya Bonaly, who then 
exchanged hugs with Harding. 
</P>
<P>
	Harding's only other performance since the 1994 Lillehammer  
Olympics was between periods of a 1997 hockey game in Reno, Nev. 
There, she was booed and a few batons resembling the one used in 
the attack on Kerrigan hit the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, her audience in a half-empty arena was figure skating  
fans, some from as far away as Tokyo, Japan. None who were asked 
were willing to admit that they came specifically for Harding. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the crowd was loud and supportive, many giving the  
28-year-old Harding a standing ovation before and after her skate. 
</P>
<P>
	As she stepped to the ice, a spectator flashed a sign that read  
``Good luck, Tonya.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When she came out, she had tears in her eyes,'' said her  
adviser, Michael Rosenberg. ``Then some little girl yelled, `We 
love you, Tonya.' She perked right up. I think she handled herself 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a turquoise-and-purple outfit, Harding performed to a  
saxophone-and-guitar medley. She fell on her first and final jumps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight she proved she's a fine athlete,'' former Olympic  
champion Dick Button said. ``She had a very structured program. If 
she had packaged it better and not been so nervous, it would've 
turned out better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harding said she's not ready to predict whether her future as a  
pro is secure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take things day by day. If things come up from this, that  
will be absolutely wonderful,'' she said. ``If it doesn't, that's 
OK, because I got to come out and skate for all my fans and see all 
my friends. It's just been great.''

<HEADLINE> Martin On Verge of PGA Tour Card  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	By Sunday, the most remarkable comeback in golf this year may no  
longer belong to the U.S. Ryder Cup team. Casey Martin is four 
rounds away from becoming a card-carrying member of the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	While everyone was either debating Ryder Cup revenue, salivating  
over that shot by Sergio Garcia or still wondering what Jean Van de 
Velde was thinking, Martin quietly put together four top-10 
finishes on the Nike Tour to climb to No. 12 on the money list. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 15 after the Nike Tour Championship this week are  
automatically exempt on the PGA Tour next year. Commissioner Tim 
Finchem will be on hand in Dothan, Ala., to hand out the working 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
	For once, the cards are stacked in Martin's favor.  
</P>
<P>
	Martin declined interviews leading to the Nike Tour Championship  
but told Golfweek magazine last week: ``It would be a lifelong 
dream becoming a reality, especially with the kind of obstacles 
I've been up against.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin has a rare circulatory disorder in his right leg known as  
Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome, which causes severe pain and 
makes it virtually impossible for him to walk 18 holes. 
</P>
<P>
	For that reason, he sued the PGA Tour and won the right to use a  
cart in February 1998. The tour, which argued that walking is an 
integral part of the game, filed an appeal that could be ruled upon 
by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's talent has never been in question. A teammate of Tiger  
Woods at Stanford, he won on the Nike Tour last year, qualified for 
the U.S. Open and nearly played well enough at Olympic Club to get 
into the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Timing, however, is critical.  
</P>
<P>
	Martin's leg isn't getting any better. His best chance to make  
the big leagues could also be his last chance. 
</P>
<P>
	It is mathematically possible that at least four players from  
No. 16 on down could play well enough this week and earn just 
enough money to bump Martin out of the top 15 and relegate him to 
another year on the Nike Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	But that wouldn't be the greatest tragedy.  
</P>
<P>
	Imagine Finchem handing Martin his diploma Sunday along with the  
rest of the Nike Tour graduating class. Then imagine the 9th U.S. 
Circuit Court handing down a verdict in favor of the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	What good is a card if Martin doesn't have a cart?  
</P>
<P>
	A popular solution is for the tour to ban carts from its  
tournaments, as it should, and then grant an exception to Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Nicklaus, who testified on behalf of the tour in Martin's  
lawsuit and adamantly opposes carts on the PGA Tour, said that's 
what he would suggest if the tour won the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd grandfather it in,'' he said. ``I think that's the right  
thing to do in his case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Finchem indicated Monday that would not be an option.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the same posture we've always been,'' he said. ``At  
this point, the policy board has been very clear that we will try 
to maintain our rules, subject only to what the courts say. If we 
were to prevail in court, we would implement the rule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the moment, however, Finchem is more interested in  
celebration than speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	As the commissioner, his role is to protect the integrity of the  
game. Still, Finchem can't help but cheer Martin around the track 
for his final lap. 
</P>
<P>
	``For anybody to get through the Nike Tour and get their card is  
a stellar accomplishment,'' Finchem said. ``It means you're one of 
the best players anywhere. To do it with the adversity he's 
undergone -- not just physical adversity, but with all the 
distractions -- is, well, incredible. 
</P>
<P>
	``He must be admired and is admired by everyone in the game for  
what he's done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It might not seem that way to Martin. He could see Finchem on  
the course Sunday, then see him in court down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	But Martin and everyone else divided by the cart controversy  
would do well to keep the issues separate. This isn't the PGA Tour 
against Martin, but the tour against the use of carts at the 
highest level of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``He probably feels the world is against him,'' Nicklaus said.  
``He probably feels more people are against him than really are. I 
think everybody is rooting for this kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That includes Nicklaus.  
</P>
<P>
	And in spite of a sticky situation it could create for the PGA  
Tour, that includes Finchem. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just unfortunate that we have a rule that negatively  
affects him,'' Finchem said. ``But that aside, you can't help but 
admire his accomplishments -- even if he falls short.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The time now is not to worry about a cart but to cheer on a  
courageous rider.

<HEADLINE> McDonnell Douglas Corp. Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- McDonnell Douglas Corp. and a Chinese  
government-owned company were indicted Tuesday on charges they 
tried to circumvent U.S. export controls and ship sophisticated 
machine tools to China for use in military production. 
</P>
<P>
	The China National Aero-Technology Import Export Corp., or  
CATIC, was the first Chinese government entity ever charged with 
violating U.S. export controls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese Foreign Ministry, in a statement, denied wrongdoing  
and asked ``the American side ... to seek truth through facts in 
dealing with this problem and resolve this case appropriately so as 
not to impact the improvement and development of China-U.S. 
relations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment comes during a sensitive period in U.S.-Chinese  
relations. The FBI is redoing its investigation of alleged Chinese 
nuclear espionage. And while China seeks admission to the World 
Trade Organization, Customs Service agents are conducting several 
major investigations of other potential export violations involving 
China and aerospace equipment, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involved McDonnell Douglas' sale in 1994 of 19 surplus  
machine tools to the Chinese company for $5 million. The U.S 
government licensed the export of the tools only for use in a joint 
Chinese-McDonnell Douglas program to build 40 McDonnell Douglas 
civilian airliners in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the sophisticated machine tools were diverted, in  
violation of license restrictions, to the Nanchang Aircraft Corp., 
where China makes Silkworm cruise missiles and A-5 attack aircraft. 
The diversion was discovered before the tools were misused in 
China, according to U.S. Attorney Wilma Lewis and a 1996 report by 
Congress' General Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Lewis told a news conference, ``this criminal  
conspiracy was a serious attempt to circumvent the export control 
laws designed to protect the national security of the United 
States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said the machine tools  
were secondhand, made in 1983, ``not at all technologically 
advanced and can be bought on the international market without 
limitations.'' And it vigorously denied that the tools' end user 
was a factory that makes Silkworm missiles, saying such reports 
were ``fabrications with ulterior motives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement criticizes what it called ``anti-China forces in  
the United States'' that have tried to ``raise an anti-China wave'' 
in America through what it called ``groundless accusations and 
attacks, seriously poisoning the atmosphere of China-U.S. 
relations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Customs Commissioner Bonni Tischler said the charges  
demonstrate that ``firms that sacrifice American security for their 
profit will pay a price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Boeing Co., which acquired McDonnell Douglas in 1997 and was  
not indicted, said that ``McDonnell Douglas did not commit any 
criminal violations in regard to the sale of the machine tools to 
the People's Republic of China and intends to vigorously defend 
against the charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-count indictment also named a McDonnell Douglas division,  
Douglas Aircraft Co., and Robert Hitt, who was director of Douglas' 
China program office. Also indicted were three CATIC affiliates, 
CATIC/Supply, located in Beijing, and CATIC (USA) Inc. and TAL 
Industries Inc., both located in El Monte, Calif., and two Chinese 
citizens employed by CATIC, Hu Boru and Yan Liren. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to conspiracy, the defendants were charged with  
false statements to the U.S. government about the intended use for 
the machine tools that McDonnell Douglas sold CATIC after its 
Columbus, Ohio, plant closed. In Columbus, the tools had been used 
to bend and shape steel for the U.S. B1 bomber and the Peacekeeper 
and Titan missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``U.S. Customs agents, with the assistance of Commerce  
Department investigators, found clear and convincing evidence that 
CATIC and McDonnell Douglas knowingly diverted sensitive technology 
for Chinese military use,'' Customs Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Boeing said, ``Douglas Aircraft Co. ... discovered the  
machine tools were not in the proper location and promptly notified 
the U.S. government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Douglas was ... responsible for retrieving the machine tools  
and making sure they were moved to an appropriate location,'' 
which, Boeing said, ``prevented the possibility of their being used 
for any improper purpose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said, however, that McDonnell Douglas' April 1995 report  
of the diversion came in response to a Commerce Department inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury charged that McDonnell Douglas failed to inform  
U.S. officials that CATIC had initially sought to buy 19 surplus 
machine tools to produce parts for C-17 military transports and 
that the U.S. company had told the Chinese no export licenses could 
be obtained for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment also alleged that CATIC sold some of the machines  
to Nanchang even before the export license application was filed 
listing civilian aircraft production as the end use. McDonnell 
Douglas also failed to tell U.S. officials that Nanchang officials 
had inspected the machines at the Columbus plant and that McDonnell 
Douglas' contract for joint civilian airliner production was in 
jeopardy, the indictment charged. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. House report this year said McDonnell Douglas sought to  
have the six machines left at the unauthorized location, but the 
Commerce Department rejected that. With the approval of the U.S. 
government, the tools have since been consolidated at a factory in 
Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, the companies could face fines of up to $10  
million apiece. The individuals could be imprisoned for up to five 
years and fined up to $250,000.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Suffers Through 3rd Hurricane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Eastern North Carolina residents are  
struggling to raise their spirits after suffering through three 
straight hurricanes that have deluged the state with 4 feet of 
rain, damaged thousands of homes and turned lives upside down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope that it gets better soon,'' said Casheila Draughn,  
43. 
</P>
<P>
	She spoke Monday from a Red Cross center, a day after Hurricane  
Irene dropped up to 11 inches of rain onto the region. The storm 
veered out into the Atlantic late Sunday without making landfall in 
North Carolina, but it still brought heavy rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it can't be as bad as it was the last time, but I'm  
just hoping for life to get close to normal,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Normal may still be months away: Hundreds of people already live  
in camping trailers because their homes were damaged in floodwaters 
from Hurricane Floyd in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rains overwhelmed rivers and promised to produce more  
serious flooding later this week as runoff drains into the Tar, 
Neuse and Cape Fear rivers -- the last with crests 8 feet above 
flood stage expected. 
</P>
<P>
	To make matters worse, the next storm, Jose, was swirling in the  
Caribbean and reached hurricane strength today with maximum 
sustained winds topping 75 mph. Forecasters were uncertain of 
Hurricane Jose's track but said it could threaten the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	State transportation officials said Irene was responsible for  
156 road closings as of late Monday. That was on top of 75 roads 
that still remain closed in the aftermath of Floyd. Still, inland 
rainfall amounts in most areas were below more grave predictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were fortunate,'' Gov. Jim Hunt said Monday. ``It didn't  
turn out to be a great big thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people living in a government camper trailer park in  
Rocky Mount returned to their trailers Monday after spending Sunday 
night in a shelter. Schools in the area returned to a normal 
schedule today. 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Farrar, a Red Cross mental health counselor in Tarboro,  
said many people have become ``hypervigilant'' -- nervously mindful 
of every change of weather, every rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just demoralized,'' she said. ``They just want no more  
of this. The last one was more than they could handle, and now 
people are saying, `No way, Jose.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Irene was blamed for one death in North Carolina, a motorist  
whose vehicle hydroplaned into a tree Sunday in Granville County. 
Eight other people died as a result of the storm elsewhere, 
including five in Florida. A pair of Irene-spawned tornadoes were 
blamed for two injuries in North Carolina on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Cross has dispatched 244 mental health workers to  
eastern North Carolina to help flood victims cope. That is more 
than for any other disaster except the Oklahoma City bombing, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are overwhelmed right now by the fact that they have to  
clean up after the storms and be a mom and a dad and an employee,'' 
said Red Cross spokeswoman Gina Giarronardo. 
</P>
<P>
	First North Carolinians suffered through Hurricane Dennis, which  
battered the coast for a week and dumped up to 8 inches of rain. 
Two weeks later, Floyd poured 20 inches of rain, causing record 
flooding and 49 deaths. An additional 8 inches fell less than two 
weeks after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Irene arrived.  
</P>
<P>
	``You get lifted up and the next thing you know, something else  
happens,'' said Karen Mabry, who was flooded by Floyd and then 
watched Irene's floodwaters creep into Tarboro, 65 miles east of 
Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	The story was the same along South Carolina's coast.  
</P>
<P>
	A day after Irene swelled the Waccamaw River to almost 9 feet  
Monday -- or nearly 2 feet above flood stage -- Mary Roberts returned 
to her riverside home to find 8 inches of water sloshing in her 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lived here 42 years, and I've never had water in my  
house,'' said Roberts, who has no insurance. ``It's been 
heartbreaking. My floor just bulged up. My ceiling's cracked. My 
furniture's molded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Savannah Bluff, islands of craggy sand mounds protruded from  
bluish-black waters coursing across the road. Cars splashed 
single-file through the murky streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had carpet everywhere. It's in the Dumpster,'' said Dorothy  
Paul, pointing to a wobbly metal block in the sea of floating 
debris. She and her husband had planned to start repairs on their 
home this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think we'll wait till next week,'' said Paul, who is  
retired. ``Until those floors dry, we don't know what's going to 
happen. No one can predict this kind of weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pauls built in Savannah Bluff five years ago. Despite the  
flooding, they have no plans to leave the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you tell me where it's more likely there will be no  
earthquakes, no tornadoes, no hurricanes, no flooding -- you tell me 
where, and I'll move,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Tries Working on Offense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- One week they can't pass, the next week  
they can't run. At least the Dallas Cowboys are running out of 
things that can go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised at our inefficiency, regardless of the area,''  
said quarterback Troy Aikman, who has led Dallas to two touchdowns 
over the last 10 quarters. ``We have a good group of players. To 
have the outings we've had the last couple of weeks is 
disappointing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Dallas will have to figure out how a running game  
that was the best in the NFL could be limited to 24 yards on 25 
carries by the New York Giants. The result: a 13-10 loss Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Cowboys were scratching their heads over how a  
passing attack that had been full of big plays could complete just 
one pass for more than nine yards against winless Philadelphia. The 
result: a 13-10 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Chan Gailey sees the pattern and doesn't like it. But he  
doesn't think the big picture is as bad as the short-term view. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're five games into the season,'' Gailey said Tuesday. ``I'd  
rather be 5-0, but we're not. We're 3-2. I've been with teams that 
have been a lot worse off and went to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know we're not that far away. We've got to keep working,  
keep fighting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas has gone from undefeated and in position to pull away in  
the NFL East to struggling and needing a victory Sunday against 
Washington to tie the Redskins for the division lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys only have themselves to blame.  
</P>
<P>
	In Philadelphia, Aikman threw an end zone interception and Smith  
fumbled at the Eagles' 1. Against New York, Dallas got only three 
points out of drives that had first downs at the Giants' 29, 28 and 
14 -- all in the first half. The Cowboys also missed two field goals 
and had a punt returned for a touchdown against them for the first 
time since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we execute in just some of those situations, we don't lose  
those two games,'' Gailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	After seeing Aikman struggle against the Eagles, the Giants had  
to be tempted to let their secondary shine. Instead, New York 
decided to go after Emmitt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Using eight and often nine defenders at the line of scrimmage,  
the Giants held Smith to zero or negative yards on 10 of his 22 
carries. His longest run was five yards and finished with just 26, 
despite the starting offensive line being intact for the first time 
since the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman wasn't able to go deep and burn New York for its  
aggressiveness because he didn't have the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The waves of linemen and linebackers charging at him produced  
three sacks, one interception, one intentional grounding that was 
flagged and several more that weren't. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had one-on-one matchups underneath and we tried to take  
advantage of that,'' Aikman said. ``We just weren't able to get the 
ball downfield.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The root of the problem was blocking -- or a lack of it. Guys  
either missed assignments or the Cowboys had fewer blockers than 
the Giants had blitzers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of mental mistakes,'' Gailey said. ``It  
wasn't just the offensive line. There were other positions, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kicker Richie Cunningham's dwindling accuracy also hurts. He's  
just 3-for-7 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey said it will be up to kicking coach Steve Hoffman to  
straighten out Cunningham. There are no plans to bring in a free 
agent to put some heat on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Richie and Steve have gone back and looked at the last couple  
of years on tape and looked for technical flaws,'' Gailey said. 
``They can't find any difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just going through a slump. People get into those things.  
He's got to get out of it. He has shown he can do it. We'd like him 
to get back into that mode as quick as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey said rookie receiver Wane McGarity, who was supposed to  
get some of Michael Irvin's snaps, will be out at least two or 
three weeks after dislocating his shoulder in the Giants game.

<HEADLINE> Glickman: Ag To Dictate Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Agriculture issues will determine whether  
the upcoming round of World Trade Organization talks succeed, U.S. 
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman says. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing a trade and agriculture forum of agriculture  
interests, Glickman said the risks for farmers are huge in the 
three-year negotiating round that begins with a ministerial meeting 
next month in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agriculture is probably the most sensitive issue in the  
talks,'' Glickman said Tuesday. ``But it will determine whether the 
next trade round is successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the WTO will launch a new round of free trade talks,  
covering areas including agriculture and services, Nov. 30-Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stakes for agriculture are enormous. Production from one  
of every three acres in this country is exported,'' Glickman said. 
``Agriculture is twice as reliant on exports than any other 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With farm cash receipts of $5.2 billion in 1998, Washington  
state has a very large stake in the talks, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Producer of half the nation's apple crop, Washington is  
responsible for 85 percent of apple exports. Record world 
production and weakening Asian currencies hurt the state's apple 
growers in recent years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening markets and trade liberalization will be major goals in  
the talks, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agricultural tariffs, which average 50 percent worldwide, are 10  
percent in the United States, putting this country at a big 
disadvantage, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks also will target ``trade barriers erected in the name  
of flawed science,'' such as bans of genetically modified crops, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And U.S. trade representatives will work to eliminate export  
subsidies and open state-sponsored trading boards ``so they face 
the same risks as private companies,'' Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several dozen lawmakers last week urged U.S. negotiators to seek  
better trade conditions for farmers at the Seattle talks. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton already has promised to seek new export  
opportunities for America's farmers and make agriculture a priority 
at the WTO negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- California cotton growers have plenty of  
reasons to be optimistic, despite cotton prices hovering near 
20-year lows, industry analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad news elsewhere -- including rising oil prices, which makes  
polyester more expensive, and hurricanes pounding the East Coast, 
which hurts cotton production there -- translates to good news here. 
</P>
<P>
	That's long overdue. Growers, who need 80 cents a pound to break  
even, are looking at December cotton futures trading at 54 cents a 
pound this week, just a few cents higher than the 13-year-low set 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying that we're going to zip right out here and only  
go up and up like stock markets do,'' said Jack Scoville, an 
analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. But, he said, he sees no 
reason for prices to continue to drop. ``We're down near the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California farmers are enjoying a dry, albeit late, harvest.  
Reports from the fields are encouraging, said Gene Lundquist, vice 
president of Calcot Ltd., a Bakersfield cotton marketing 
cooperative. Yields are exceeding the 1,195 pounds-per-acre 
government estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's hurricanes prompted the U.S. Department of  
Agriculture to cut its estimate for total U.S. cotton production by 
more than 1 million bales. 
</P>
<P>
	Other factors that also could push the price up: The Asian  
economy is rebounding; Congress has approved -- and President 
Clinton is expected to sign -- legislation that brings back 
subsidies to help U.S. cotton growers earn higher prices and still 
compete on the world market; and China may join the World Trade 
Organization, a move expected to increase U.S. cotton exports to 
China by an estimated 68 percent.

<HEADLINE> Study: Exercise Combats Diabetes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A study of more than 70,000 women found that  
exercise can reduce the risk of developing adult-onset diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	The study of women participating in the Nurses Health Study  
found that the most vigorous exercise was associated with a 46 
percent lower risk. But even brisk walking lessened the chances of 
diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers were led by Dr. Frank B. Hu of the Harvard  
School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the American  
Medical Association, is in line with previous research on both men 
and women. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National  
Institutes of Health recommend Americans to get at least 30 minutes 
of moderate exercise a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Diabetes occurs when the body is insulin-deficient, becomes  
impaired in its capacity to use insulin, or both.

<HEADLINE> Gains in U.S. Equities Help Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A key U.S. economic report helped European stocks  
close higher Tuesday, with pharmaceutical and technology shares 
leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
	The equities were buoyed by the release of U.S. September  
consumer prices, which eased concern that inflation is rising 
faster than expected. But analysts said the U.S. Federal Reserve's 
monetary policy meeting in November would continue to cast a shadow 
over equity markets worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 614 European companies jumped 6.10  
points, or 2.1 percent, to close at 302.01. The biggest gainers 
were pharmaceuticals, up 3.2 percent, and technology stocks, up 2.9

<HEADLINE> Keaton Talks About Being Single </HEADLINE>

<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Michael Keaton, the star of ``Beetlejuice''  
and ``Batman,'' said finding love is one role he just can't seem to 
master. 
</P>
<P>
	``You ask me why I'm single?'' Keaton said while in town to  
serve as chairman at the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's wine auction. 
``I would honestly tell you, man, it is a total mystery to me. I 
would never have bet it in a thousand years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said part of the problem could be his celebrity, although he  
still tries to be the normal guy he always was while handling new 
demands on his time. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding somebody to connect with is hard enough, he said, but  
adding in Hollywood and fame really throws off the equation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get to meet a lot of amazing people,'' Keaton said Monday.  
``The problem is the circumstances always seem off. I can't put my 
finger on it. There's something that happens that doesn't make it 
easy.''
