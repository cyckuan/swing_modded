<HEADLINE> Iraq to Grant Crude Oil to Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi government has decided to
grant a quantity of crude oil worth 10 million U.S. dollars to
help Vietnam overcome the aftermath of the tragic floods which hit
the country's central provinces in November and December 1999, the
Press and Information Department of Vietnamese Foreign Ministry
announced in a press release Thursday.
</P>
<P>
according to the press release, the aid is outside of the
quantity of oil that the United Nations permitted Iraq to export
under the program on oil for food.
</P>
<P>
The press release also said that relevant Vietnamese agencies
are discussing with the related 7 countries the necessary
procedures to receive the aid.

<HEADLINE> S'pore FM Calls for Political Will on Malaysia Side for Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Minister for Foreign
Affairs S. Jayakumar told the parliament Thursday that political
will is needed on Malaysia side in promoting economic cooperation
with Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on suggestions by a MP for an economic union or
Suzhou-type Industrial Park between Singapore and Malaysia to
strengthen economic cooperation, Jayakumar said "there are endless
opportunities for both countries to cooperate for mutual benefit,
but there must be political will on the other side to respond to
Singapore's efforts."
</P>
<P>
"if there is any perceived lack of progress on economic
cooperation, let me say it is not due to any lack of effort on our
part," he added.
</P>
<P>
Responding to reports that Malaysia have proposed to construct
a bridge between Singapore and Johor, the southernmost state of
Malaysia across the Johor Strait, to replace the current causeway,
Jayakumar said that the Singapore government has not received any
official proposal from the Malaysian government and Singapore
government can only consider a formal proposal from its
counterpart as this is an important issue involving two sovereign
countries.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a suggestion for more resources to be made
available to the civic societies for the promotion of people-to-
people cooperation between Singapore and Malaysia, the minister
agreed that the fostering of good relations is not the sole
prerogative of governments and the private sector and mass
organisations all play a role in promoting good relations with
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Singapore parliament is sitting for 10 days from Tuesday on to
debate the national budget.

<P>
PARIS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Women's World Cup runners-up China
beat hosts France 1-0 in a soccer frienly in Orleans, France, on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women looked cautious and were pressed hard in the
first half by the active French side, which was widely believed a
second-rate team in Europe.
</P>
<P>
But the hosts failed to convert quiet a few chances into goals
and the two sides were deadlocked at 0-0 after the first half.
</P>
<P>
China's World Cup heroines Sun Wen, Wen Lirong and Zhao Lihong
were substituted into the field after the interval and finally
turned the tide around.
</P>
<P>
Chinese captain Sun lobbed a rebound from the French keeper
into the net eight minutes into the second half to give the
visitors a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
France, who were forced to step up its defence before the more
experienced rivals, could never pose any threat.

<HEADLINE> Four Fifths of Business Software in Cyprus Believed Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- There are some four fifths of
business software in Cyprus believed to be unauthorized, according
to Friday's Cyprus Weekly newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Citing the figures provided by Business Software Alliance (BSA)
Cyprus, the local branch of a worldwide anti-piracy body, the
newspaper said that unauthorized use of business software in Cyprus
cost legitimate software developers 18 million Cyprus pounds (36
million U.S. dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that about 80-85 percent of business software in
Cyprus is obtained illegally.
</P>
<P>
BSA Cyprus said that it has been using persuasion and the law to
put things right.
</P>
<P>
The local BSA said that in the last 14 months, it had organized
a seminar on managing computer software and eight training sessions
at the Police Academy attended by 250 policemen.
</P>
<P>
One civil action for copyright infringement against an
architect's studio was recently settled, with the firm in question
undertaking to buy original software and to pay damages and costs.
</P>
<P>
Another civil action for copyright infringement against a
retailer is still pending.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Ready for Arab FM Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese capital of Beirut has
got ready for a two-day Arab Foreign Ministers Conference that
opens on Saturday to display Arab solidarity and support to
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Outside the prime minister's office, which will be the venue of
the conference, are flying the national flags of 22 Arab countries
and the Arab League. Banners and slogans are also seen along the
major streets in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Although it has not received any threats to sabotage the
conference, the Lebanese government has stepped up security
measures in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers with rifles have been deployed and roadblocks erected
around the prime minister's office. Helicopters were hovering above
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The Arab foreign ministers conference is the first of its kind
to be held in Lebanon since 1975 when the civil war erupted in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Al Hoss described the gathering
as "a message to Israel that any further attacks on Lebanon would
be viewed as directed against the entire Arab world", the An Nahar
newspaper quoted him as saying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
All Arab countries will attend the landmark meeting except
Somalia that will be represented by its permanent ambassador to
Arab League in Cairo because of the civil war in the Horn of Africa
nation.
</P>
<P>
Qatar is sending a delegation headed by its crown prince, having
the highest-ranking representation.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) will also send
a delegate as an observer "as a show of their support" to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League decided to transfer the venue of the conference
from Cairo to Beirut to show Arab solidarity and support to Lebanon
after Israel launched raids on February 8 on Lebanese
infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Rejects Ties With Israel Unless Arab Lands Returned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Kuwaiti official on
Friday ruled out any relations between Kuwait and Israel before the
latter returns all occupied Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait will not normalize ties with Israel as long as it
occupies Arab territories," said Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad
Al-Sabah before departing for the Lebanese capital of Beirut to
attend the 113th Arab League foreign ministers' meeting due on
Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured a large part of the Arab territories in four
wars with its Arab neighbors during the past half century. Only
part of the occupied lands have been returned so far.
</P>
<P>
Israel's government of Prime Minister Ehud Barak last week
promised a unilateral withdrawal from south Lebanon by July 7 after
22 years of occupation.
</P>
<P>
On the Arab foreign ministers' gathering, Sabah, who is also
Kuwait's first deputy prime minister, said the meeting is a clear
message to Lebanon that the "whole Arab world is supporting it in
all issues."
</P>
<P>
The meeting in Beirut is an "expression of solidarity with
Lebanon and will be a clear message to Israel and the whole world
that Lebanon is not alone," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about halting Arab normalization of ties with Israel,
Sabah said that he did not think the meeting would discuss this
issue as it was discussed in previous meetings and a decision was
already made.
</P>
<P>
Arab sources expected Arab foreign ministers would throw weight
behind Lebanon in its resistance to repeated Israeli attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some of the sources also expressed belief that the
meeting would pave the way for holding an Arab summit aimed to
regain the lost Arab solidarity, which was caused by the 1991 Gulf
war triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Envisages Renewed Arab Solidarity in Beirut Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary General
Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid said Thursday that he expected the
upcoming Arab Foreign Ministers Conference would show Arab
solidarity and stress the sovereignty of the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid, upon arriving here Thursday from the Egyptian
capital of Cairo, said the meeting would be a "historic show of
solidarity with Lebanon" to deter Israel from large-scale attacks,
local media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
He came to examine the final arrangements for the conference to
be held in the Lebanese capital on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid announced in a statement upon arrival that holding
the conference in Beirut, instead of in Cairo where the AL is
headquartered, is a message to Israel that Lebanon will not be
alone against Israeli aggression.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, Israeli warplanes bombed three Lebanese power
stations as a retaliation to Lebanon's Hezbollah guerrillas'
attacks.
</P>
<P>
AL spokesman Talaat Hamed said in Cairo that the forthcoming
Beirut conference would "adopt a united stance and chart a
collective program" to support Lebanon against Israeli attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hamed also declared that the conference is expected to forge a "
common Arab strategy" on other issues, including a plan to convene
regular Arab summits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saudi Ambassador to Lebanon Sadek Al Mufti said the
conference would probably declare support for Lebanon's resistance
against Israel's occupation and freeze the normalization of
relations with Israel pending a breakthrough on the Syrian and
Lebanese tracks of peace talks, the local Al Hayat newspaper quoted
him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied parts of south Lebanon in 1978 and set up a
self-styled "security zone" in the region in 1985. The zone covers
about 1/10 of Lebanese land, allegely to protect its north from
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese guerrillas, spearheaded by the Iranian and Syrian-
backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, have since been fighting to oust
the Israeli troops and the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army out of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Amid fightings between Israeli troops and Hezbollah guerrillas
in south Lebanon, which have led to the death of seven Israeli
soldiers since the beginning of this year, the Israeli government
has announced to withdraw troops from south Lebanon by next July.

<HEADLINE> Papantoniou Orders Extensive Inquiry in Falling ASE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Capital Market Committee
would launch an in-depth investigation in the stock market to
determine if there were stock manipulation phenomena, Greek
Economy Minister Yiannos Papantoniou announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The order by Papantoniou for an extensive inquiry on the way
stock prices are being formed in the Athens Stock Exchange (ASE)
came after the stock prices dropped dramatically Thursday when
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis made a speech concerning
Athens's formal application for the European Union's economic and
monetary union(EMU) membership.
</P>
<P>
Papantoniou said that the conclusions would be made public
within next week and if there was evidence the necessary actions
would be taken.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Greek equity prices have seen a sharp decline
with the general index on the ASE ending at 4.863,55 points, down
0.04 percent Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government and the opposition parties have clashed
over the country's stock market moves.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Greece's economy was on the right track,
premier Simitis said Friday that the bourse would move to higher
levels in the long term.
</P>
<P>
He urged political parties and the government not to intervene

EU Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid Poul
Nielson made the pledges in Kigali, capital of Rwanda. The
commissioner inaugurated the General Prosecutor's Office and
visited the Supreme court, according Rwandan News Agency report.
</P>
<P>
Nielson said: "the European Commission's commitment to this
sector marks a response to the genocide and the consequent need to
end impunity. With a judicial system and infrastructure that were
looted and destroyed, the Commission became rapidly involved in
areas of essential need."
</P>
<P>
The European Union Commission is helping Rwanda to improve its
judicial sector in areas of human resources, infrastructure,
genocide trials, prisons and non-genocide justice.
</P>
<P>
The 1994 genocide in the tiny central African country left a
legacy of crowded prisons with genocide suspects of over 125,000
awaiting trial.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Sugar Companies Hit By Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Almost all of Mozambique's
operational sugar companies have been badly affected by the
devastating flood that hit the southern and central regions last
month.
</P>
<P>
This has severely compromised the government's target of
producing 310, 000 tons of sugar by 2005, Mozambique News Agency
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Director of the National Sugar Institute, Arnaldo Ribeiro, said
that the Mafambisse sugar company, in Dondo district of the
central Sofala province, hit by Cyclone Eline on February 22, will
suffer an output decline of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ribeiro added that the Xinavane sugar company in southern
Maputo province was affected by the flood on the Incomati river
and will also have a production loss of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The most serious situation happened at the Maragra sugar
company where all the agricultural work done in the last two and a
half years was completely lost," he said.
</P>
<P>
This plantation is located near the mouth of the Incomati. The
Maragra sugar company was only re-inaugurated in late 1999 after
years of paralysis.
</P>
<P>
The company will have to start afresh, from the replanting of
the cane to the reconstruction of the irrigation system and the
road network. Ribeiro fears that the company will not produce any
sugar for two years.
</P>
<P>
As for the Marromeu sugar company in Sofala, Ribeiro said that
"the company was practically unaffected. There was some high wind
but it didn't cause any problems".
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the country's sugar sector has been producing
45,000 tons of sugar annually.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian FM, Palestinian Official Meet on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel
Ilah al-Khatib met on Friday with visiting Palestinian chief
negotiator for the interim phase, Saeb Erekat, who conveyed a
letter from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to King Abdullah Bin
Hussein on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Arafat briefed Abdullah on the latest
developments on the Palestinian track following his three meetings
in the past few days with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
Jordan's official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
Khatib told Erekat that Jordan hoped the new understandings
between Israel and the Palestinians would lead to a favorable
climate and tangible progress in the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks by implementing agreements already signed between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also reaffirmed his country's persistent
support for the rights of the Palestinians, including the
establishment of an independent state on their own soil.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Erekat, also minister of local government of the
Palestinian National Authority, thanked Jordan for its intensive
contacts with all parties concerned to push forward the peace
process after it signed a peace treaty with the Jewish state in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat agreed earlier this week to renew the peace
talks in Washington late this month after the Eid al-Adha, or the
Feast of Sacrifice, to pave the way for the conclusion of a
framework agreement and a final peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Under an apparent compromise package, the Israeli side will
carry out a long overdue 6.1 percent troop withdrawal from the West
Bank within days, and a framework agreement on the status of
Jerusalem, borders, Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements
will be hammered out by May.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat also agreed to honor a September 13 deadline to
strike a final peace agreement between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Former PM Sentenced to One-year Imprisonment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Necmettin Erbakan, former prime
minister of Turkey and leader of the banned Welfare Party (RP), was
sentenced on Friday to one-year imprisonment on a charge of
arousing hatred.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan didn't attend the court hearing held at No.1 Diyarbakir
State Security Court (DGM), but his lawyers Mehmet Ener and Yasar
Gurkan were present, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The court accused Erbakan of issuing a speech in eastern Bingol
province in 1994 to sabotage peace, unity and solidarity among
people.
</P>
<P>
But Erbakan's lawyers said it was not correct to accuse Erbakan
client who defended unitary state. The video tapes the court showed
were not original, requesting Erbakan to be acquitted.
</P>
<P>
They claimed that the term of filing a suit is three months, but
this suit was filed against Erbakan after three and half years.
</P>
<P>
In June 1996, Erbakan-led pro-Islamic Welfare Party and True
Path Party formed a coalition government, which stepped down less
than one year due to implementation of a series of Islamization
policies in internal and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the Turkish Constitutional Court banned Welfare Party
on a charge of violating a law of secular Turkey and forbade
Erbakan to serve in politics within five years.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Gold Prices Dive on British Decision to Sell Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Gold prices dropped drastically in
Jordan after the British government announced last week to sell 150
tons of its gold reserve to the international market, dealers in
Amman said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The price of 24-karat gold declined from 7.5 Jordanian dinars
(10.36 U.S. dollars) to 6.8 dinars (9.52 dollars) per gram, while
the price for 21-karat gold fell to 5.8 dinars (8.12 dollars) from
7.25 dinars (10.15 dollars) per gram.
</P>
<P>
The drop in gold prices is mainly attributed to the announcement
of the British treasury last Friday to hold six 25-ton auctions to
reduce its gold reserve by another 150 tons, as part of its plan to
cut its gold reserve from 715 tons to 300 tons.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian dealers said they expect the gold prices in Amman to
sink further for a short period of time before stabilizing.
</P>
<P>
"The British decision was a major reason for the decline. It did
not affect our market alone, but international market as well,"
said one dealer in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Other dealers said the weak demand in the local market in the
past weeks also contributed to the fall in gold prices.
</P>
<P>
Gold is mainly used for making rings, necklaces and other
decorations in the desert kingdom while women in some part of the
country also asked for gold from their lovers as dowries for
marriage.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Special Envoy Favors Face-To-Face Talks On Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Alvaro De Soto, U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan's special envoy to Cyprus, stated here Friday
that meaningful talks regarding Cyprus should be staged and one
method is face-to-face talks.
</P>
<P>
De Soto made the remarks following his meeting with Turkish
Minister of State Sukru Sina Gerel, reported the Anatolia News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. special envoy, who arrived in Ankara Thursday on a
fact-finding mission, also met with Foreign Minister Ismail Cem.
</P>
<P>
During his previous leg of tour, De Soto met with leaders of the
Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus and exchanged views with
them on their indirect, or so-called proximity, talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the Mediterranean
island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
In response to Annan's renewed call late last year, leaders of
the two communities have held two rounds of U.N.-brokered proximity
talks in New York and Geneva respectively. No tangible results were
reported during the talks. They are due to hold a third round of
such talks in the U.N. headquarters in New York on May 23.
</P>
<P>
De Soto said that he had a very "beneficial" meeting with Gerel,
but declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
He said Turkey and Greece play important roles in the efforts to
find a solution to the Cyprus issue and the roles were defined in
the agreements that had been signed.
</P>
<P>
Since 1998, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has demanded
that northern Cyprus, which declared statehood in 1983 and was
recognized only by Turkey, be recognized internationally as a
prelude to reunification in the form of a two-state confederation.
</P>
<P>
But the request was rejected by the United Nations, which stands
for a bizonal and bicommunal federation as the way out of the
decades-long crisis.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President to Visit Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
will pay an official visit to Israel by the end of March, Cyprus
News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, a cooperation agreement will be signed between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus ruling Democratic Rally party leader Nicos Anastasiades
Friday had a meeting with Israeli Ambassador to Cyprus Shemi Tzur.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Tzur said they discussed bilateral relations
and Clerides' visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Tzur described Clerides' visit to Israel as "very important."
</P>
<P>
He said that he also discussed with Anastasiades the Cyprus
issue and the Middle East peace process, and that he expressed
Israel's policy of supporting all international efforts to reach a
workable solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-six years is too long and it is about time a solution
was found to the benefit of the Cypriots and for the region," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the Mediterranean
island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
A third round of the United Nations-sponsored indirect talks is
scheduled to take place in May in New York between the leaders of
the two communities, in an effort to promote progress toward direct
talks aimed at a solution on the island.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the peace process in the Middle East, he said the
peace process is going on and there have been very positive
developments in the past few days between the Palestinians and the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat agreed early this week to resume the stalled Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks later this month in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Over 300 Toronto Kids Doubted to Suffer Food Poisoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 300 kids in Toronto are
missing school as a result of a food-linked "outbreak", the
Toronto Sun newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 of 550 students at John Wanless Public School in north
Toronto were absent Thursday, with many suffering from vomiting
and diarrhea, medical officer Barbara Yaffe of Toronto Public
Health was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Parent Claire Reed said her son Alex, 6, had the pizza and
vomited nine times beginning just before midnight Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
About 100 of Willowdale Middle School's 570 students were
absent, too because of syndromes of vomiting, nausea, dizziness
and cramps. Several staff members at both schools also called in
sick, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Health inspectors were doing tests at both schools Thursday,
collecting food samples from the cafeteria at the Willowdale
School and a local Pizza outlet.
</P>
<P>
"We're treating them as outbreaks that may be food poisoning,"
Yaffe said.
</P>
<P>
But Paul Methot, a vie-president at Pizza said the fact many
kids were ill who didn't eat the pizza casts doubt on the food-
poisoning theory.
</P>
<P>
Toronto is in the middle of a 14-week health inspection blitz,
which was launched last month after 11 people became ill and
complained about a dinner at a seafood restaurant.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen restaurants have been ordered to close as they
were found to have immediate health risks.

<HEADLINE> Angolans Determined to Neutralize Every Hostile Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Angolans are determined to
"neutralize and annul" every campaign orchestrated against their
country.
</P>
<P>
This statement was made by Norberto dos Santos, political
secretary of the People's Liberation Movement of Angola (MPLA), on
behalf of Joao Lourenco, secretary general of its ruling party
MPLA.
</P>
<P>
According to informed sources here on Friday, the statement
alluded to the insult levelled against Angola by Mario Soares,
former Portuguese President and member of the European Parliament,
who had issued a statement hostile to Angola, describing the
country as a corrupt dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
Every hostile campaign organized abroad will clash, said
Norberto dos Santos, adding that he believes in the capacity of
the Angolan people to turn around negative situations into
resounding victories.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, the Socialist Group in the European
Parliament has demanded that "the Angolan government retract the
grave accusations levied against the former Portuguese President",
 calling the charges an "unacceptable attack".
</P>
<P>
In a communique released by the group, the European socialists
"reject the defamation campaign waged by the Angolan Information
Minister Vaal Neto and strongly urge the Angolan government to
immediately retract the slander against Soares and formally
apologize for the damages it may have caused".
</P>
<P>
The position was approved unanimously by the Parliamentary
group of the European socialists, with 180 seats as the second
largest group in the Strasbourg legislature.
</P>
<P>
According to Norberto dos Santos, after the government clearly
defined its goals to bring peace to Angola, along with the
military victories in a time shorter than expected, many sectors
outside Angola are hurt, he said, adding that "in this way we have
seen a series of accusations against the government growing."

<HEADLINE> Malawian President Calls for Quicker Response to Flooding in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Malawian President Bakili
Muluzi Friday called for neighboring countries to make quicker
response to help the flood-hit Mozambique where tens of thousands
of people have been left homeless and starving.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Lusaka international airport, Muluzi described
the floods affecting Mozambique as unfortunate and devastating.
</P>
<P>
Most African neighboring states were shocked and overtaken by
the extent of the floods, hence their slow response to
Mozambique's request for help, said the Malawian president who is
on a two-day official visit to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent elections and his second-term of
office, Muluzi said the constitution provides for a specific term
of office for each and every leader and it must be respected.
</P>
<P>
He further said the people are the ones who are the
"constitution", hence their desire must be respected too.
</P>
<P>
The agenda of Muluzi's Zambia tour is not known yet.

Tanzanian town of Arusha under the new mediator, former South
African President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said that he was happy that all groups involved in the
conflict were engaged in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Arusha peace talks may take long because it was aimed at
solving a very serious problem. The process was moving smoothly
and consensus would be achieved eventually, Museveni said.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya, who held talks with Museveni at Paara Safari Lodge in
western Ugandan district of Masindi, said that Museveni has been
playing a very important role in pushing for the Burundi peace
process.

<P>
Burundi's seven-year civil war between Tutsi-led government and
ethnic Hutu rebels has claimed more than 200,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Belgians Call for Equal Rights Between White, Blue Collars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 100 university professors,
managers and other labor experts called for equal rights between
white-collar and blue-collar workers, local media said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The protesters jointly signed a declaration demanding an end to
discrimination against blue-collar workers and a uniform job
statute for white-collar and blue collar workers.
</P>
<P>
Belgium is one of the few countries which still observes
different social laws that apply to white- and blue-collar workers.
</P>
<P>
Blue-collar workers have less job security and income
protection than white-collar workers. The average notice of
unemployment Belgian employers give blue-collar workers is the
shortest in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Belgian white-collar workers, on the other hand, are one of the
luckiest groups in the world, and enjoy the longest notice period.

PRAGUE, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Slovakia's national economy grew
at a snail's pace of 1.9 percent while unemployment soared to a
new high over 1999, the Czech news media quoted the Slovak
National Statistics Service as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Gross Domestic Product of Slovakia in 1999 totaled 779.3

<P>
Other economic figures for Slovakia were not optimistic either.
The total number of jobless reached 535,000 persons by the end of

The investment and foreign exchange reserve decreased 16.7
percent and 74 percent respectively from the levels of the

<HEADLINE> China's WTO Entry to Better Safeguard Developing Countries' Interests: Supachai (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Supachai Panitchpakdi, Thai
deputy prime minister and commerce minister, and awaiting director-
general of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2002, said here
today in an interview with Xinhua that China's entry into the WTO
will promote understanding in this global trade organization,
balance the interests among its members, and better safeguard the
interests of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The economist-turned future WTO chief said he will aim at
narrowing the gap between developing countries and developed
countries and promote trust and understanding between them, in
which he will "seek support" from China.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, he views China's entry into the WTO as a
significant move that is auspicious for the world's less developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
Supachai, who will take over Michael Moore in 2002, will be the
first in the position from a developing country. He, on behalf of
the Thai government, struck a bilateral deal with the Chinese side
concerning China's entry into the WTO this morning.
</P>
<P>
Noticing the accelerated momentum in China's bid into the WTO,
Supachai expressed his confidence that China will become a WTO
member before a new round of multi-lateral talks kicks off.
</P>
<P>
He urged China to play a more constructive and active role in
the world economy, asserting that China's experiences in the
course of its development are very valuable to other developing
countries. In his view, China should assume "the role of a bridge"
between developing countries and the world's major economies.
</P>
<P>
Supachai was among the first few people to advocate China's
rightful role in the WTO some five years ago. "It appears to me
that we cannot have complete global trade relations when a sizable
economy like China is left out," he insisted.

<HEADLINE> China's WTO Entry to Better Safeguard Developing Countries' Interests: Supachai (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looking over the economic globalization and global trade
expansion, Supachai said that developing countries haven't
benefited as much from it, that developing countries never got
enough attention, and that "they gave approval because they had to.
"
</P>
<P>
One problem infesting the post-Uruguay world-trade regime, he
pointed out, is that a certain number of countries, especially
Western countries, have "drifted back to protectionism" in the
form of non-tariff barriers such as excessive product standards.
</P>
<P>
It still remains unclear whether trade expansion and
globalization are beneficial to the less- or least-developed
countries, he said, pointing to the example of the heavy burdens
imposed by intellectual property laws on underdeveloped countries.
</P>
<P>
Having noticed the phenomena, Supachai decided that one
priority for his future WTO work lies with the 48 least- developed
countries. "I want to set up programs to help them specially", he
pledged.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called for strengthening cooperation between
major developing countries. China, as a major global economic
entity, will set an example for the rest developing countries, if
only it will be more opener, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to inform developed countries of problems
facing developing countries right now. He said he does not mind
much their promotion of economic liberalization, but he will let
them know the bad effects of economic liberalization to less
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"What I want to inject into the WTO is a sense that we are in
one global village, one same world," the future WTO chief stressed.

<HEADLINE> hke031076 --Philippine Govt, MILF to Resume Talks on May 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) have agreed to
open their 4th round of formal talks on May 2-3, the Philippine
News Agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The PNA said peace negotiators from the government and the MILF
signed an agreement on Thursday as they wound up their 3rd round
of formal talks in Cotabato city in the southern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, some 60 MILF peace panel members
have the full access to the negotiating table without fear of
being harassed or arrested by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the security and safety guarantee, both peace panels
have earlier inked the general ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
Both panels exuded confidence that in their 4th round of talks
the peace process would yield more fruits after the government
panel agreed to touch on the identities of the 39 MILF camps
submitted to them on November 6, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed on four talking points including the
creation of the technical working groups and the clustering of the
nine agenda items to six, said the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has been fighting for an independent state in Mindanao
during the past two decades. However, the separatist group began
to negotiate with the government last October, hoping to resolve
their disputes peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada said earlier that he is
giving the peace process up to June this year to come up with
substantial results.

<P>
HANOI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has set 2000 targets to
virtually wipe out addiction among school students and root out
the cultivation of opium poppy in the country, Vietnam News Agency
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Three mountainous provinces of Son La and Lai Chau in the
northwestern region and Nghe An in the central were singled out as
the major targets for crackdown on opium planting.
</P>
<P>
A conference on summing up the situation on drug-related crimes
control in the country was held here Friday. Prime Minister Phan
Van Khai attended the conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference also urged to further crack-down on drug
trafficking from outside into the country as well as on drug-
related crimes, and effective control over the spread of addiction.
</P>
<P>
Mass media of the country will be mobilized to launch a nation-
wide campaign among people of all walks of life to raise public
awareness of the drug addiction problem and how to stay away from
it.
</P>
<P>
The ministry of health will introduce more traditional
medicines into detoxification and rehabilitation services.
</P>
<P>
Last year, narcotics squads of the country discovered 11,768
drug-related cases and arrested 22,835 offenders, an increase of
29.2 percent and 22 percent, respectively, over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Detoxification and rehabilitation services benefited nearly 24,
000 drug addicts, a year-on-year increase of 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, there are 104,547 people in Vietnam still in addiction,
according to the conference.

<HEADLINE> Information Stressed for Management of SADC Water Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) have been urged to pay more
attention to information on water in a bid to manage the resources
in an effective, efficient and sustainable way.
</P>
<P>
The non-availability and accessibility of information strongly
affects the management of water resources at national, regional or
international level, David Saviye, Zambian Minister of Energy and
Water Development, said in Lusaka Friday.
</P>
<P>
When launching the SADC Global Water Partnership in Zambia, the
minister said that there has been no mechanism to coordinate water
management activities at national or regional levels.
</P>
<P>
It is only through networking that information would be
obtained easily, Saviye said, adding that information is now not
sufficiently and readily available to interested parties to enable
them to make good decisions and take beneficial actions on water
resources management.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that since the world is increasingly becoming
inter- dependent, there is need for Zambia to strategize on
sharing and knowing what information should be shared with other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Saviye said the launch of the SADC Global Water Partnership in
Zambia has come at the right time when his ministry is about to
start implementing the water resources action program in the
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The successful implementation of the program would largely
depend on the active participation of all stakeholders, the
minister added.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Main Opposition Leader to Step Down for New Alliance Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada's biggest opposition party
leader Preston Manning has expressed a willingness to step down in
search of the more powerful reins of a new political coalition,
the Canadian Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Manning, head of the official opposition Reform Party, told
Toronto's Empire Club Thursday that he would turn over his
responsibility to his deputy Deborah Grey if his party members
agreed to form a coalition with the provincial Conservatives in
the final referendum on March 25.
</P>
<P>
Once approved, the 57-year-old Reform leader said, he wanted to
focus on the run-up to the broader-based leadership of the
Alliance to be unveiled on June 24.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I can do justice to both jobs for three months,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Manning's statement came after the Reform Party convention last
month adopted his strategy for the coalition to attract more
support in vote-rich Ontario and unseat the Liberal Party, which
has been ruling since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Alberta Treasurer Stockwell Day announced in
Edmonton his bid to run for the leadership of the Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Manning welcomed Day to the race saying, "I don't think of him
as a threat. If one of our missions is to get the taxes down, we
need all the expertise from Alberta and Ontario," he added.
</P>
<P>
Before Day's announcement, Manning's only challenger was former
Reform candidate Joe Peschisolido from Toronto.

<HEADLINE> Putin Calls for Joint CIS Anti-Terrorist Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia's acting President Vladimir
Putin urged members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
to make a joint effort to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"The events in the North Caucasus and Central Asia have
confirmed the need for the pooling of efforts by CIS countries to
counteract terrorism and extremism," Putin told an extraordinary
meeting of the CIS Council of Interior Ministers here.
</P>
<P>
"Only by gathering national security forces and special
services into one fist can we effectively crack down on
international terrorists and extremism on CIS territory," said
Putin.
</P>
<P>
He said a major front on anti-terrorist activities is "the
creation of a CIS database on terrorists and terrorist
organizations, as well as on sources of their financing."
</P>
<P>
This requires an exchange of information and its careful and
professional analysis, said Putin, expressing hope that "the CIS
Council of Interior Ministers will conduct work in a positive key"
and this work will get into a practical stage.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Chechnya, he said that Russia's anti-
terrorist operation in the North Caucasus had entered its final
stage.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of this operation "was achieved by means of
the mobilization of all law enforcement structures and their close
cooperation," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"However, the unity of Russian society, the heroism of soldiers
and officers became the main factors ensuring the success of the
anti-terrorist operation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This struggle is in the interest of all our peoples," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo also stated at the
meeting that CIS states should jointly take "adequate resolute
measures" to oppose international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting participants discussed a program to combat
international terrorism and extremism. This program is ever more
necessary as "terrorism spreads over CIS countries; this evil must
be curbed by joint efforts," he emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Agassi, Sampras Crash out of Franklin Templeton Classic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- For the second time in four
days, fans left the Scottsdale Princess Resort disappointed.
</P>
<P>
After rain wiped out a women's final that would have pitted the
top two players in the world on Monday, the top two seeds in the
Franklin Templeton Tennis Classic Thursday were forced out of the
men's tournament as Americans Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras failed
to get out of the second round.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who entered last night's encounter with Francisco
Clavet unbeaten in 10 matches this season, was humiliated by the
Spaniard 6-1, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who was named along with Agassi to the U.S. Davis Cup
team earlier this month, suffered strained ligaments in his back
during his first-round win on Tuesday night. Continued stiffness
over the last two days forced him to withdraw from the match with
Alex Corretja of Spain.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who played a night match on Wednesday, never got
untracked in his match with Clavet, falling in 49 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"The ball was jumping off my racket," said Agassi, a three-time
champion at this event. "I never felt good from the beginning. It'
s been a long time since I had a match like this. I'm in shock and
I haven't had a loss like that in a while."
</P>
<P>
The reigning French, U.S. Open and Australian Open champion,
Agassi suffered his worst loss in a hardcourt event since April
1987, when Andres Gomez handed Agassi a 6-2, 6-0 loss in the
quarterfinals of the Japan Open.

MACAO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief executive
of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), said here on
Friday that the SAR government will take effective measures to
prevent arson and local police are making all-out efforts to seize
arsonists.
</P>
<P>
"The SAR government will by no means tolerate the crime of
arson," the chief executive said in response to a series of
serious arsons which occurred early Thursday morning. As many as
41 motorcycles and one truck caught on fire.
</P>
<P>
Police sources suspect that the vehicles were set on fire by
problem youngsters who usually idle away their time at night.
Local residents have been urged to assist police in investigations,
for such crimes are hard to crack merely with the efforts of
police.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho said that schools, families and the entire society
should work together to ensure that young people grow up healthily
and do not go astray.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the SAR government will reconsider lowering
the age of juvenile who must shoulder legal responsibility for
their criminal actions, Edmund Ho said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Providing adequate food for the 1.
2-billion-strong people remains China's top priority, said Vice-
President Hu Jintao here this afternoon during a panel discussion
of the Anhui provincial delegation to the ongoing 3rd Session of
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
"Without sustained and steady growth of agriculture and rural
economy, there would be no sustained, steady growth of the entire
national economy, and without a well-to-do life and affluence for
rural farmers, there would be a contented life for all the people
throughout China," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Great importance should be attached to agriculture sector in
order to fulfill the trans-century objectives China has laid down.
"We should take more steps to guard against and check on the
tendency of ignoring and relaxing efforts for agricultural growth
and further strengthen agriculture as the basic foundation of
national economy, especially at a time when we have had
consecutive years of good harvest," he said.

<P>
The focus should be placed on restructuring rural economy with
endeavors to be made to adapt to and open up markets, promote agro-
sciences, beef up agricultural industrialization, and facilitate
the distribution of farm produce, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreovewr, he said, "We should always care for the farmers'
basic interests, and prioritizing the increase in their incomes,
ease their burdens, and giving scope to their initiative," Hu
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The basic organizations of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
are the foundation of the Party's entire work in rural areas, Hu
said, and the Party officials in rural areas are the backbones and
mainstay for implementing the CPC's agricultural policies, and
pioneers in uniting and leading farmers in their effort to
overcome poverty and build a socialist new countryside with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
These Party officials, sound politically, hard-working and
competent, should be selected. "We should help them raise
theoretical level and legal awareness in order that they could
contribute more still and take the lead in restructuring and
developing rural economy," the vice-chairman said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang on Economic Restructuring, Poverty Relief (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin called for
speeding up economic restructuring amid economic development and
promoting economic development amid economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The president, also general secretary of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee, made the remark at a group
discussion of Shanxi deputies to the National People's Congress (
NPC), in session here since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Economic restructuring is an inevitable requirement of
economic development at the present stage, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized the following in economic restructuring:
</P>
<P>
-- To strengthen agriculture by building more agriculture-
related infrastructure facilities and protecting farmland;
</P>
<P>
-- To readjust the industrial structure and the industrial
product mix; to stop making unsalable products and close factories
that are outdated and cause pollution;
</P>
<P>
-- To push for the allying, merging and regrouping of
enterprises for economies of scale;
</P>
<P>
-- To upgrade traditional industries and restructure old
industrial bases;
</P>
<P>
-- To speed up the development of hi-tech industries;
</P>
<P>
-- To exert greater efforts to develop the tertiary industry,
especially information, banking, tourism and services; and
</P>
<P>
-- To promote a rational distribution and coordinated
development of regional economies, and rural and urban economies.
</P>
<P>
To do a better job of economic restructuring, Jiang emphasized
the following: to work out well-coordinated good plans; to bring
into play the regulatory functions of the market; to attach
importance to the role of science and technology; to combine
restructuring of the state-owned economic sector with an upgrading
of industries and a readjustment of the ownership structure; and
to help workers affected by economic restructuring overcome
difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Jiang on Economic Restructuring, Poverty Relief (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang talked about the strategy of developing the country's
west in a big way and about poverty relief at a group discussion
attended by Guizhou deputies to the NPC.
</P>
<P>
The president said the central authorities have worked out the
strategy to speed up the development of the central and western
regions for a coordinated development of regional economies. He
expressed the hope that these regions would seize the historic
opportunity by bringing into full display their own advantages.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the seven-year national poverty-relief program has
entered a crucial stage, Jiang urged local CPC committees and
governments to strengthen their sense of responsibility and
urgency, sum up their experience and work harder to basically
realize the goal of providing enough food and clothing for the
poverty-afflicted population. Jiang went on to say that since the
large-scale poverty-eradication program was launched in the mid-
1980s, impressive progresses have been made. But, he said the
phenomenon of poverty will remain in China for a long period as
the country will remain at a primary stage of socialism for a long
period of time.
</P>
<P>
The development of different areas is unbalanced due to
objective conditions and historical factors, he noted. Jiang
described the primary stage of socialism as a historical period
when people's living standard gradually goes from a relatively low
level to relative affluence.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the poverty-relief program will not mean an
end to efforts to eliminate poverty but represent the start of a
new period, Jiang said. During the 10th Five-Year Plan period (
2001-2005) and in an even longer period, China will continue to
implement a vigorous poverty-relief campaign, he said.

<HEADLINE> Arab Investments in Jordan's Stock Market Nose-dive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Arab investments in Jordan's Amman
Stock Exchange Market fell drastically during the first two months
of 2000 partly due to the pressure of over-selling in the market,
board sources said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Non-Jordanian Arab investments in the tiny market stood at 3.7
million Jordanian dinars (5.18 million U.S. dollars) by the end of
February, as against 9.9 million dinars (13.86 million dollars) for
the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign investments in the market during the first two
months amounted to 12.2 million dinars (17.08 million dollars),
accounting for 20. 3 percent of total purchases for the same
period.
</P>
<P>
However, the total amount of sales by foreign investors hit 48.5
million dinars (67.9 million dollars) by the end of February,
bringing down the market index to under 160 points on every
business day, as compared to 180 points on daily basis for the same
period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Selling orders from non-Jordanian Arab investors totalled 3.7
million dinars (5.18 million dollars) by the end of February, which
was virtually the same as their buying orders, accounted for 43.5
percent of the total amount of selling transactions by foreign
investors for the same period.
</P>
<P>
The stagnant stock market activities reflected that foreign and
Arab investors still lacked confidence in Jordan's economy, though
the kingdom managed to achieve a 1.5 percent economic growth rate
in 1999, rare and amazing since the 1990 Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom has been isolated by Arab countries for its sympathy
with Iraq during the Gulf crisis, which was triggered by Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Kuwait had normalized their ties which broke off
during the crisis, but the emirate and other Gulf states have not
opened their lucrative labor markets to Jordan, once a major source
of remittances for the kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israeli government concluded its first global
bond offering on Thursday, raising 500 million U.S. dollars through
the country's first debt-issue.
</P>
<P>
The positive issue reflected that the international business
community has stronger belief in Israel's economic policy and in
its intent on achieving peace, said Finance Minister Avraham
Shochat.
</P>
<P>
The treasury said that over 90 institutional investors from
around the world, primarily insurance companies, pension funds and
fund managers, purchased the 10-year notes at a 7.819 percent
yield. Roughly 65 percent were sold to U.S. investors.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Bank of Israel Governor David Klein proposed
Thursday to eliminate the diagonal exchange rate mechanism which
limits the extent of volatility in Israeli currency shekel's
exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Following Klein's comments, the U.S. dollar lost 0.56 percent
against the shekel and was fixed at 3.99 shekels to one dollar. On
Thursday afternoon, trading U.S. currency continued to decline to
3.985 to one dollar.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Several Israeli cabinet ministers have already
submitted proposals to Prime Minister Ehud Barak over what to do
with the apparent tax surplus that Israel will enjoy this year,
Finance Minister Avraham Shochat said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he is opposed to redoing the state budget,
since it is still unclear if this is a temporary or permanent
upsurge.
</P>
<P>
Finance Ministry figures showed that revenues thus far this year
have reached 24 billion shekels (6 billion U.S. dollars), a real
increase of 17 percent much higher than the government had
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Swissair said Thursday the number of flights
between Israel and Switzerland will increase to 25 per week this
summer from the current 19. The carrier will operate twenty flights
between Zurich and Tel Aviv and five from Geneva. Swissair will
operate 16 flights on the Zurich route, with Israel's national flag
carrier El Al handling the remaining six. El Al will also operate
the five flights to Geneva.
</P>
<P>
TUNISIA -- Fruit growers in Tunis produced 225,200 tons of
citrus in the 1999-2000 season, up by 6.5 percent from 210,500 tons
in the previous season.
</P>
<P>
A total of 30,000 tons of citrus will be exported abroad this
year while the exports volume stood at 21,500 tons during the last
season, said officials from the Citrus and Fruit Farmer Union.
</P>
<P>
Tunisian citrus mainly go to France and some other European and
Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
DUBAI -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) was planning to allow
foreign banks to open branches in the country, said Central Bank
Governor Sultan Nasir al-Swedi.
</P>
<P>
UAE is willing to permit banks of the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) members to open branches in the country pending a consensus
on a common GCC mechanism in this regard, said the bank chief.

<P>
ANKARA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- The number of signatures, supporting the proposal for a
constitutional amendment which will ensure the election of
President Suleyman Demirel for an additional five-year term, stood
at 324 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The number failed to meet the minimum of 367 votes required for
passing the proposal at the parliament, so the Turkish ruling
coalition still has to garner more signatures from deputies.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Abdullah Ocalan, leader of Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party, and his brother Osman Ocalan were reportedly getting rich by
collecting money from drug and arms smuggling and foreign agents.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan deposited his money in Syrian and Swiss banks in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Auto makers in Turkey produced 51,516 cars in the first two
months of this year, up by 63 percent from 31,561 in the same
period of 1999.

2.2 pesos (0.055 U.S. dollar) per liter on average.

<P>
The increases will take effect midnight of Friday.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 1.5 million South
African children will lose their mothers in five years due to the
scourge of HIV/ AIDS, Welfare and Population Development Minister
Zola Skweyiya said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing delegates at the second National Conference for
People Living with HIV/AIDS in South Africa's port city of Durban,
Skweyiya said the deadly disease has prompted the government to
develop a national integrated plan for children infected and
affected by the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
So far 65 million rand (about 10 million U.S. dollars) has been
 allocated to start projects over the next three years, which
include a comprehensive child care legislation that is being
developed by the South African Law Commission to address the needs
of orphans.
</P>
<P>
Deputy President Jacob Zuma said at the conference the scourge
of HIV/ AIDS is breaking down what South Africa has achieved so
far.
</P>
<P>
"We have been worried about the extent that this particular
scourge has affected our community. We recognize that HIV/AIDS is
like an invading enemy in our nation," Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 12 percent of the South African
population is HIV positive.

<HEADLINE> Faction Leaders' Libya Tour Dims Djibouti Initiative for Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Major faction leaders in
Somalia have gone to Libyan capital Tripoli, overshadowing the
forthcoming Djibouti reconciliation meeting for the country which
has had no central government since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The presence of Hussein Mohamed Aidid of Mogadishu, Mohamed
Hajji Ibrahim Egal of Somaliland and Abdullahi Yussuf Ahmed of
Puntland in Tripoli showed their stern opposition to the Djibouti
peace plan for Somalia, political analysts here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The faction leaders said that they were officially invited by
Colonel Muammar Qaddafi, the leader of Libya which maintains a
diplomatic mission in south Mogadishu for monitoring all political
movements throughout the Horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
Some observers said that Libya is organizing and encouraging
another meeting in a bid to make reconciliation among the three
factions first, while some others said it is trying to put
pressure on those leaders to accept the Djibouti initiative.
</P>
<P>
According to the peace plan announced by Djiboutian President
Ismail Omar Ghelleh late last year, a full Somali national
government is to be formulated by June this year.  And
Djibouti has made it clear that all politicians will be invited on
personal capacity to the reconciliation talks on April 20.
</P>
<P>
Clan politicians, intellectuals including 45 diaspora from
North America and Europe, have been separately invited to Djibouti
for consultations.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright discussed the situation in the Balkan region,
particularly the renewed tensions in Kosovo, with European
Commission President Romano Prodi on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Albright told reporters that she talked with Prodi about her 9-
day European trip that focused on the Balkan situation. She said
they talked about the U.S. role in Kosovo and peacekeeping
missions in the future.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said the one-hour meeting was not a negotiation and that
they only exchanged views on the regional situation. He said
cooperation between the United States and the European Union "is
growing more and more everyday."
</P>
<P>
Asked about their views on Germany's Horst Kohler as the new
European candidate for the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
Prodi said the European Commission supported the German as
Europe's IMF candidate, but Albright did not comment, saying it
needs to have a strong and qualified candidate to head the very
important international financial institution.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the U.S. Secretary of State also held talks
with senior NATO officials on recent tensions in Kosovo. She also
discussed with the EU and NATO officials, Europe's plans to build
a new rapid reaction force that would work alongside NATO and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The new force is due to be operational by 2003 and will have
between 50,000 to 60,000 troops. But the U.S. and NATO officials
said they believe the European plan for a separate military force
may be a riskier proposition than it seemed three months ago, when
the 15 EU countries decided to go ahead with the project.
</P>
<P>
During her trip, Albright gave no indication of how the U.S.
would act if tensions escalated in the Kosovo area.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Overseas Telecom Giants Promote Low-price Mobile Phone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Ericsson (China) Co., Ltd. and
Panda Electronic Group, famous producers of electronic devices in
China, will soon jointly promote a top-quality, low-cost mobile
phone in the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
According to the information released by the Ericsson Beijing
office today, the strategy behind the 999 yuan (about 120 US
dollars) phone is to get an even bigger slice of the Chinese
market for the world's leading mobile phone makers.
</P>
<P>
The new product, Panda GM518, based on the Ericsson technology,
attracted many local consumers when it debuted last week in
Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
Ericsson and Panda are reportedly discussing the timetable of
the new product's appearance market-wide.
</P>
<P>
Ericsson, Nokia, Motorola mobile phones still dominate the
Chinese market, with prices ranging from 1,500 yuan (180 US
dollars) to 3,000 yuan (360 US dollars). However, the mobile
phones made by Chinese companies, such as TCL, Konka, Panda,
Kejian, Bird, have had some impact, with high quality and
considerably low price, even though they are latecomers on the
domestic scene.
</P>
<P>
Officials with Ministry of Information Industry (MII) recently
announced that the government will cut mobile phone fees.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from MII show that China has more than 43
million mobile phone users, and the figure is likely to hit 200
million by 2010.

<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China's major cities are busily
carrying out the "Smooth Traffic Project" launched on February 26
to solve worsening traffic problems that have long annoyed urban
motorists.
</P>
<P>
The State Council's General Office recently approved the plan
for the project, initiated by the Ministry of Public Security and
the Ministry of Construction, and ordered departments concerned to
work together to tackle the overburdened traffic systems in cities
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>

growing at an alarming 18 percent a year, while new road
construction is increasing by only 8.78 percent yearly.
</P>

China has fewer than one million parking spaces, or one spot
for every 50 vehicles. And drivers in big cities often complain
about traffic jams and low speed limits.
</P>
<P>
The country is now working to ensure that its national roads
and expressways, and its urban traffic remain in good order in
anticipation of future economic growth which will require improved
traffic management.

<P>
Moreover, in the draft legislation law, people's congresses in
autonomous regions are authorized to make laws with distinct
regional characteristics.
</P>
<P>
"This has contributed tremendously to stability and development
of ethnic minority regions," said Wang Yushun, a deputy from Aba
Prefecture of southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The draft legislation law to be deliberated at the current NPC
session underlines the embodiment of the wishes of the masses of
people and enables them to participate in law-making through all
means.
</P>
<P>
In drafting a certain law to increase people's awareness
against crimes, some 6,000 pieces of advice have been collected
and sorted out in Beijing alone from the general public through
internet.
</P>
<P>
China's constitution has specifications pertaining to the work
of local legislation. And provinces, autonomous regions and
centrally-administered municipalities were first of all authorized
to enact laws back in 1979, thus a set of legislation came into
being.
</P>
<P>
Legislative bodies in the above-mentioned areas have since
extended the scope of law-making power, and succeeded in drafting
approximately 7,000 local laws.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a NPC deputy from Shanghai municipality, named
Zheng Jianling, acknowledged that local legislation should be
regulated to prevent the drafting of laws in contravention with
the Constitution and related national laws, and a set of unified
inspection and checking procedures be introduced to help
facilitate law-making in localities throughout the country.

<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Local legislative bodies should
continue to play a vital role in law-making in China, according to
deputies to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), who are
here for an ongoing annual session of the nation's legislature.
</P>
<P>
Law experts favor local legislation, which they regard as
indispensable and irreplaceable in view of economic differences
and cultural diversity in China with a population of 1.3 billion
with 56 ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
At the ongoing session of the Ninth NPC, a draft legislation
law is expected to be discussed and deliberated so as to
standardize the nation's law-making, which is expected to define
the scope of authorities in the law-making of legislative bodies
at different levels.
</P>
<P>
The legislative body in Beijing plans to enact a law on
promotion of courage for combating crimes, an issue of public
concern. This law is in urgent need, as it is necessitated by
residents' indifference in face of public crimes as revealed in
some media reports, according to Liu Zhuquan, a Standing Committee
member of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Local legislation deals with new problems in society and cover
new areas, which national laws often fail to cover, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Some laws, after being enforced for some time in localities,
have been turned into national laws, in case of two laws first
initiated only in Beijing area for protecting the rights of the
elderly and youngsters or children.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the draft legislation law, people's congresses in
autonomous regions are authorized to make laws with distinct
regional characteristics.

MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-seven persons were hurt,
four of them seriously, when the bleacher of the Basista Municipal
Gymnasium in the northern Philippines collapsed Friday morning,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Basista Mayor Jesus Perez said in a report that the east-side
bleacher of the gymnasium collapsed at 9:25 a.m. due to big number
of spectators watching field demonstration during the opening of
the town fiesta.
</P>
<P>
"The bleacher gave way due to the big number of people, adults
and children that packed in it," said Perez, who was among those
watching the field demonstration.
</P>
<P>
the witness said the injured were rushed to the Bayambang
District Hospital and various private hospitals. As of 3:00 p.m.,
53 of the injured had already been discharged from the hospital,

Perez said the bleacher, made of wood with concrete posts, was
newly constructed. He said the bleacher was quite strong but had
to collapse because of the big weight that it carried.

<HEADLINE> Indian Govt Shelves Sale of Equity in Oil Giant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
decided to shelve the proposed disinvestment of 10 percent of the
public equity in the country's oil giant, the Indian Oil
Corporation (IOC), due to adverse market conditions, sources with
the Ministry of Petroleum and Department of Disinvestment said
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government-owned equity of the IOC, whose disinvestment
process was scheduled to begin this Saturday, will not hit the
market during the current 1999-2000 financial year, which
concludes at the end of this month, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The IOC share price, which once hit a yearly high of 325 rupees
(7.56 U.S. dollars), has now dropped to 176 rupees (4.09 dollars),
leading to the government's decision against an immediate
divestment.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum Minister Ram Naik had said earlier that the
government would only sell its equity in the IOC when it could get
a "good price."
</P>
<P>
However, financial experts here predicted that with a postponed
IOC disinvestment, the government might have difficulty to attain
its target of collecting some 26 billion rupees (604.65 million
dollars) in the 1999-2000 financial year through the privatization
of Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs).
</P>
<P>
According to the pre-budget Economic Survey released at the end
of last month, the Indian government only mopped up less than 15

<HEADLINE> Feature: The Elephant Dilemma of Thailand  by Yuan Li </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 10 (Xinhua) -- As the national symbol of
Thailand, elephants used to be a guarantee of the country's
independence. But now they are banned from roaming the streets of
the capital and there is no place for them to live as their home.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) Friday starts its
crackdown on elephants roaming the streets of the capital, and
warned mahouts not to defy the ban otherwise they will face
serious penalties.
</P>
<P>
According to the ban, elephants found roaming and foraging for
food in the city will be apprehended and their mahouts charged.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the ban has been planned for a long time
but faced stiff resistance from the mahouts.
</P>
<P>
A group of 13 elephants and their angry mahouts held a rare
street protest against the ban in Bangkok Monday.
</P>
<P>
The mahouts blamed the metropolitan government for turning a
deaf ear to their problems. The leaflets they distributed urged
people to be sympathetic with the elephants that would die if
driven out of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the government and the BMA to solve the
problems in a sustainable manner instead of looking for quick
fixes.
</P>
<P>
The mahouts and elephants are mainly from the country's poor
northeastern province of Surin, where the mahouts can usually find
work only half the year as rice growers. There are about 200-plus
elephants in Surin, and feeding an elephant is quite a burden.
</P>
<P>
The mahouts said they wouldn't have come to Bangkok if they had
had a good living at home.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that up to 150 mahouts and their elephants will
repeat their protest in Bangkok next Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, BMA officials insisted bringing elephants to Bangkok
is dangerous for man and beast.
</P>
<P>
Last month, an elephant broke loose from its mahout and charged
down one of Bangkok's busiest street before a veterinarian used a
tranquilizer gun to bring it down.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend an elephant was electrocuted by high-voltage
electricity while trying to enter a pineapple plantation in
western province of Prachuap Khirikhan.
</P>
<P>
Reports of elephants being hit by cars or falling into ditches
and canals are also nothing strange for Thais.
</P>
<P>
But as their natural food sources dwindle due to deforestation,
and their usefulness as menial labor and a means of transportation
have virtually been eliminated by technology, the elephants,
having no way to go, entered the cities where they are essentially
reduced to begging.
</P>
<P>
Typically, mahouts in Bangkok sell bananas and sugarcanes to
tourists, who feed them to elephants for about 50 cents a handful.
</P>
<P>
The mahouts and their elephants usually rest during the day and
roam the city at night. Their income is quite good compared with
that at home.
</P>
<P>
They can earn 1,000 to 2,000 baht (26.7 to 53.3 U.S. dollars)
per night. It takes about 20 dollars to feed an elephant, so the
mahouts can have enough leftover to feed themselves.
</P>
<P>
After leaving Bangkok, the mahouts said they can hardly find
enough food to feed their elephants.
</P>
<P>
Some experts suggested the government set up a budget to
restore the forest in Surin by growing crops to increase the food
sources and hiring mahouts as government's employees to help take
care of the crops and the elephants.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from Friends of the Asian Elephant, a
conservation group, there were 10,000 domesticated elephants in
Thailand at the turn of the last century, and many times that
number in the wild. Now, there are fewer than 5,000 in all, with
more than 300 roaming the streets of Bangkok and other major
cities of the country.
</P>
<P>
The group urged the Thai government to find effective ways to
protect elephants, otherwise the pachyderm will be extinct.

<P>
NEW DELHI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Nitish Kumar, chief minister of
northeast India's Bihar state, announced his resignation on Friday,
only one week after he was sworn in, the Press Trust of India (PTI)

Kumar decided to resign without seeking a vote on a confidence
motion he moved earlier in the Bihar state assembly, the PTI said.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a debate on his motion in the assembly, Kumar
conceded that he did not enjoy majority and would therefore choose
to resign, the PTI reported.

Kumar, a leading figure in the ruling National Democratic
Alliance, resigned from his office as Minister of Agriculture in
the Indian cabinet last Friday after receiving an invitation from
Bihar Governor V.C. Pande to form the new government in Bihar.

<HEADLINE> Canada Concerned Over Peacekeeper Deployment in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada is seriously
concerned whether the deployment of a robust peacekeeping force
will actually take place, visiting Canadian Secretary of State for
Africa Davida Kilgour said in Cape Town on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the South
African National Assembly, Kilgour said Canada has voted in favour
of the United Nations Resolution 1291 of sending 300 military
observers and 5000 soldiers for peacekeeping mission in the
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
But, he noted that the United States has very little political
will to launch a proper peacekeeping mission in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. does not want to commit "the resources or the people
to a robust mission as peacekeeper or even peacemaker in the DRC",
Kilgour said.
</P>
<P>
"We need a strong peace enforcement mission capable of
disarming the rebel factions in the DRC," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Kilgour urged South Africa to use its influence to push for a
more robust commitment to resume peace in the DRC.

<P>
Moscow, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The main Chechen rebel leaders are
still staying in Chechnya and making attempts to flee the region,
a top Russian intelligence official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, main rebel field commanders
Shamil Basayev and Khattab are in Chechnya, but are still making
attempts to break out of the republic," Director of Russia's
Federal Security Service (FSB) Nikolai Patrushev told press.
</P>
<P>
The FSB is taking measures to prevent the rebel leaders from
escaping, he said, noting that "the possibility of terrorist acts
still exists," although "the terrorists' opportunities have been
reduced."
</P>
<P>
Patrushev said that the Chechen terrorists are preparing
terrorist acts not only in Chechnya and its neighboring republics,
but also in other Russian regions. "We have obtained information
as to this," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Russian Security Council denied plans for
creating a "super KGB."

MACAO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR) government will soon adopt a new policy which
safeguards the employment of local workers and restricts the use
of foreign labors.
</P>
<P>
The policy will enable companies and factories to recruit new
labors from outside Macao or extend the employment term of the
current foreign labors as long as the enterprises promise that
they employ a certain percentage of local labors.
</P>
<P>
The policy is expected to be put into effect at the end of
March or early April, according to officials with the Labor and
Employment Services of the Macao SAR government.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said that the percentage may vary with
regard to different economic sectors as the jobless rates in these
sectors are not the same. The industries which suffer severe
unemployment should use more local labors.
</P>
<P>
At present, unemployment rate in Macao is 6.5 percent. Official
sources said that the rate can be reduced to a reasonable level in
one or two years.

care centers, three multi-services centers, four social centers,
and three support teams for the elderly.

<HEADLINE> Application for Living Buddha's Reincarnation Approved in Gansu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The application for the
reincarnation of the sixth Kungtangcang Danbawangqu living Buddha,
who died on March 1 at the age of 75 in northwest China's Gansu
Province, was approved on March 4, official sources disclosed
today.
</P>
<P>
The application was made by the provincial Buddhism association
and others in Tibetan Buddhism circles.
</P>
<P>
Disciples of Tibetan Buddhism expressed their support and
thanks for the approval, saying that it reflects the Party and
government's care for them and respect for the religious rituals
of Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the reincarnation will be made in accordance
with Tibetan Buddhism rituals and traditional methods.
</P>
<P>
Danbawangqu was born in Sichuan Province in 1926 and became the
six Kungtangcang living Buddha in 1931.
</P>
<P>
He was a member of the Standing Committee of the Seventh,
Eighth, and Ninth Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, vice-chairman of the Eighth
Gansu Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, and a member of the
standing committee of the Buddhist Association of China.

<TEXT>
<P>
So, effective supervision systems should be sought for to curb
a growing number of criminal cases that involve surprisingly
amounts of money, seemingly indicating that criminals have no
sense of law at all, NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee
members said.
</P>
<P>
It's far from adequate to strengthen supervision only within
the Party, greater efforts are also needed to encourage the masses,
special organizations, public opinion, and non-Party personages to
have a more active role in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"We should promote government institutional reform and further
improve government functions in a bid to build up a highly
efficient, coordinated, standardized administrative system and
working mechanism," said Chen Chunlong, deputy president of the
Beijing Higher People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more endeavors should be made to implement
independent accounts for revenue and expenditure, government
purchasing, and public bidding for projects in an attempt to
prevent corruption from the sources, he suggested.

<P>
Many NPC deputies and CPPCC members urged that a nationwide
anti-corruption campaign be pushed forward to combat corruption
right to the end.
</P>
<P>
The Wednesday execution of Hu Changqing, former deputy governor
of Jiangxi province, once again shows the determination of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and the central government to weed
out corruption.
</P>
<P>
However, NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members also
voiced their concern that Hu Changqing-alikes would turn up as the
anti-corruption drive is a long and arduous process.
</P>
<P>
"We have to start with effecting a permanent cure for this
problem, taking harsher measures to plug up loopholes existing in
our system that corrupt officials might take advantage of," said
Wu Xiuping, a CPPCC National Committee member.
</P>
<P>
China has been making headway in building up its legal system,
with the NPC Standing Committee having passed 370 laws and related
resolutions and local people's congresses having passed far more
laws and regulations over the past two decades, to basically form
a socialist legal framework with Chinese characteristics.

<HEADLINE> Software Piracy Rampant in Cyprus: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Unauthorized use of business
software in Cyprus cost legitimate software developers 18 million
Cyprus pounds (36 million U.S. dollars) in 1998, said a newspaper
report on Friday.
</P>
<P>
About 80-85 percent of the business software used in Cyprus is
believed to have entered the markets illegally, according to the
latest figures by Business Software Alliance (BSA) Cyprus, the
local branch of a worldwide anti-piracy body.
</P>
<P>
BSA Cyprus said that it resorted to persuasion and law to put
things right.
</P>
<P>
In the last 14 months, it has organized a seminar on managing
computer software and eight training sessions on anti-piracy at the
Police Academy attended by 250 policemen.
</P>
<P>
One civil action for copyright infringement against an
architect's studio was recently settled, with the firm in question
pledging to buy genuine software and pay damages and legal costs.
</P>
<P>
Another case against a retailer is still pending, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Copyright violations in Cyprus carry a fine of up to 1,500
pounds (3,000 dollars) and/or three years in jail.
</P>
<P>
All offenders are also exposed to the possibility of a civil
action which demands damages.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- After returning from the Sharm el Sheikh summit with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak spoke by telephone Thursday night
with Jordan's King Abdullah Bin Hussein to update him on the
negotiations. Israel Radio reported that Abdullah was pleased with
the progress made.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister David Levy quoted Mubarak as saying
that he believed progress was about to be made on both tracks and
that the Syrian-Israeli talks will start up again within a month.
</P>
<P>
In Damascus, European Union (EU) Middle East envoy Miguel
Moratinos told reporters after meeting Syrian Foreign Minister
Faruk Shareh Thursday that EU is working very hard in order to help
the parties resume their talks.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- As negotiations with the Palestinians resume, Barak is
working toward a new plan for a limited agreement, under which
Israel would recognize a Palestinian state on part of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, and in return the Palestinians would consent to
Israeli annexation of some 10 percent of the West Bank areas.
</P>
<P>
The new proposal does not address the future of some 40 percent
of the West Bank, the status of Jerusalem or the right of return
for Palestinian refugees. The plan is intended to skirt a
confrontation between the two sides, which is likely to occur if
they fail to reach a settlement by the deadline and then resort to
unilateral steps.
</P>
<P>
Barak came up with this idea after concluding that it would be
impossible to resolve all the issues on the table by September,
which is the current deadline for a permanent status agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Six out of 10 Jewish Israelis would favor giving up the Golan
Heights and accept the evacuation of all Jewish settlements there
in return for full peace with Syria and a withdrawal from Lebanon,
according to a recent poll by the Jaffee Center for Strategic
Studies at Tel Aviv University.
</P>
<P>
The poll also said that nine out of 10 Jewish Israelis
questioned believe that a referendum for a peace treaty would be
accepted by a majority of the Jewish population.
</P>
<P>
The pollsters said their findings are remarkable, because in the
past the Golan Heights had been considered non-negotiable property
by most respondents.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The fate of the Abu Dis area, to the east of Jerusalem, is
still "an open question," Barak's tope adviser Danny Yatom said
Thursday, signaling a readiness to discuss Palestinian demands for
Israel to relinquish control of the area.
</P>
<P>
Yatom's remarks, made in an interview with Israel Radio,
immediately led the Likud party to accuse Barak of having decided
to divide Jerusalem, which Israel claims as its "eternal and
indivisible capital."
</P>
<P>
Barak made it clear Thursday night in a statement that villages
in the Jerusalem area would be handed over to the Palestinians as
part of the upcoming 6.1 percent West Bank withdrawal. However, the
statement added, all land transfers in any future agreement will be
discussed at the appropriate time.

<HEADLINE> Feature: The Elephant Dilemma of Thailand  by Yuan Li </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 10 (Xinhua) -- As the national symbol of
Thailand, elephants used to be a guarantee of the country's
independence. But now they are banned from roaming the streets of
the capital and there is no place for them to live as their home.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) Friday starts its
crackdown on elephants roaming the streets of the capital, and
warned mahouts not to defy the ban otherwise they will face
serious penalties.
</P>
<P>
According to the ban, elephants found roaming and foraging for
food in the city will be apprehended and their mahouts charged.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the ban has been planned for a long time
but faced stiff resistance from the mahouts.
</P>
<P>
A group of 13 elephants and their angry mahouts held a rare
street protest against the ban in Bangkok Monday.
</P>
<P>
The mahouts blamed the metropolitan government for turning a
deaf ear to their problems. The leaflets they distributed urged
people to be sympathetic with the elephants that would die if
driven out of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the government and the BMA to solve the
problems in a sustainable manner instead of looking for quick
fixes.
</P>
<P>
The mahouts and elephants are mainly from the country's poor
northeastern province of Surin, where the mahouts can usually find
work only half the year as rice growers. There are about 200-plus
elephants in Surin, and feeding an elephant is quite a burden.
</P>
<P>
The mahouts said they wouldn't have come to Bangkok if they had
had a good living at home.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that up to 150 mahouts and their elephants will
repeat their protest in Bangkok next Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, BMA officials insisted bringing elephants to Bangkok
is dangerous for man and beast.
</P>
<P>
Last month, an elephant broke loose from its mahout and charged
down one of Bangkok's busiest street before a veterinarian used a
tranquilizer gun to bring it down.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend an elephant was electrocuted by high-voltage
electricity while trying to enter a pineapple plantation in
western province of Prachuap Khirikhan.
</P>
<P>
Reports of elephants being hit by cars or falling into ditches
and canals are also nothing strange for Thais.
</P>
<P>
But as their natural food sources dwindle due to deforestation,
and their usefulness as menial labor and a means of transportation
has virtually been eliminated by technology. Elephants, having no
way to go, entered the cities where they are essentially reduced
to begging.
</P>
<P>
Typically, mahouts in Bangkok sell bananas and sugarcanes to
tourists, who feed them to elephants for about 50 cents a handful.
</P>
<P>
The mahouts and their elephants usually rest during the day and
roam the city at night. Their income is quite good compared with
that at home.
</P>
<P>
They can earn 1,000 to 2,000 baht (26.7 to 53.3 U.S. dollars)
per night. It takes about 20 dollars to feed an elephant, so the
mahouts can have enough leftover to feed themselves.
</P>
<P>
After leaving Bangkok, the mahouts said they can hardly find
enough food to feed their elephants.
</P>
<P>
Some experts suggested the government set up a budget to
restore the forest in Surin by growing crops to increase the food
sources and hiring mahouts as government's employees to help take
care of the crops and the elephants.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from Friends of the Asian Elephant, a
conservation group, there were 10,000 domesticated elephants in
Thailand at the turn of the last century, and many times that
number in the wild. Now, there are fewer than 5,000 in all, with
more than 300 roaming the streets of Bangkok and other major
cities of the country.
</P>
<P>
The group urged the Thai government to find effective ways to
protect elephants, otherwise the pachyderm will be extinct.

<HEADLINE> India's Industrial Production Up 9.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- India's industrial production
recorded an impressive growth rate of 9.4 percent in January 2000
as against 5.2 percent in the same period last year, the Central
Statistical Organization said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The hike of the industrial production in January was powered by
a double digit growth in the crucial manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector, accounting for more than two-thirds
of the total industrial production, rose by 11.4 percent in
January as against 5.9 percent in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the index of industrial production during April 1999
- January 2000 period was nearly double at 7.2 percent as against
3.8 percent during the same period recorded a year ago.

LAGOS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo has urged banks in the country to reduce their too high
interest rate, The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper,
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the president as saying in the capital Abuja
on Thursday that "no farmer or small-scale industrialist could
take a bank loan at the current interest rates, successfully repay
and remain afloat in business."
</P>
<P>
The current interest rate, which is often as high as some 30
percent, is harmful to the recovery of Nigeria's economy, he said
at a meeting with the leadership of the Union Bank of Nigeria, a
major bank in the most populous African nation.
</P>
<P>
"Bankers should adopt policies and programs that would help the
ordinary citizens to benefit from the macro-economic activities of
the government," he said.

He urged the banks to assist rural dwellers cultivate banking
habit by opening and sustaining more rural branches.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Tanzania to Guarantee Fish Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
advised Tanzanian stakeholders in Lake Victoria to assign
competent personnel to certify the quality of fish fillets
destined for export, Tanzanian media reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Wednesday while visiting projects supported by the
EU in the Lake Victoria zone in Tanzania, EU Commissioner for
Development Poul Nielson said the move will ensure that the
quality standards required by foreign markets supported by the
European bloc are adhered to.
</P>
<P>
The certification process requires, among other things,
chemical and biological analysis carried out by credible
institutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the setting up of credible, independent laboratory
facilities will ensure that the 11-month fish export ban from the
lake imposed on Tanzania by the EU last year will not occur in
future.
</P>
<P>
Nielson also stressed the importance of sustainability of fish
industry in the lake, saying the fragile ecological balance of the
lake should be maintained.
</P>
<P>
The EU is Tanzania's single largest market of fish from Lake
Victoria.
</P>
<P>
One year ago, the EU suspended imports of fresh fish fillets
produced from Lake Victoria, the largest in Africa, following
reports that fishermen of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda had used
cotton pesticides to poison fish.
</P>
<P>
The three countries incurred great loss in foreign exchange
earnings following the trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
The ban on Tanzania was lifted in January this year after the
country made great efforts to persuade the EU to believe that its
lake fish products met the required safety standards.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Clean up Niger Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government Thursday
inaugurated an 87-member committee in Abuja to clean up the
environmental degradation in the country's oil-producing Niger
Delta.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Friday quoted
Minister of State on Environment Ime Okopido as saying at the
launching ceremony of the committee that the foreign oil firms
operating in the delta area had offered to help fulfill the
clean-up task.
</P>
<P>
Okopido, also head of the committee, told the major
multinational oil companies operating in the country that "future
drilling permits will be closely determined by each company's
level of environmental compliance as well as the production of
acceptable environmental impact assessment reports."
</P>
<P>
The Niger Delta, originally a rain forest covered area, has
been seriously polluted since oil was found there in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Industrial discharge, gas flares, crude oil spill and poverty
were among the causes threatening both the ecological system and
health of residents in the delta.

<HEADLINE> Number of Displaced Angolans Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of displaced persons in
the Angolan capital Luanda has dropped by 17 percent in the past
three months as many displaced people have begun returning to
their home towns, a government minister said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Social Welfare Minister Albino Malungo did not give the
figures of the displaced persons in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
But observers here estimated that there are still some 514,000
displaced persons staying in Luanda where they can get more means
of subsistence and better living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Malungo noted that there has been a movement towards the areas
of origin, especially to the war-torn central cities of Andulo and
Malange.
</P>
<P>
According to local analysts, some 3,000 displaced persons have
so far returned to Malange since last December.
</P>
<P>
By December 1999, there were 620,000 displaced persons in
Luanda, 400, 000 in the central coast Benguela Province, and
200,000 in the southern Huila Province.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are 3.6 million displaced persons in
the southern African country which has suffered over 25 years of
civil conflicts between the government troops and the National
Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) rebels.

<HEADLINE> Chiba out of Nagoya Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Former world 10,000-meter bronze
medalist Masako Chiba of Japan will miss Sunday's Nagoya
International Women's Marathon due to a groin injury, organizers
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Takeshi So, manager of the Asahi Chemical athletics team, said
that Chiba complained of pain in her right groin area Thursday and
decided to withdraw from Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal also means that Chiba will not be able to
qualify for the Olympic marathon since the race doubles as Japan's
final selection meet for the Sydney Olympic women's marathon.
</P>
<P>
"I still hope that she'll be able to qualify for the 10,000
meters. I want to believe she will recover quickly and give it a
try as long as there is a chance for an Olympic berth out there,"
So said.
</P>
<P>
Chiba, fifth finisher in the 10,000-meter race at the 1996
Atlanta Olympics, began training for the marathon after winning
the 10,000-meter bronze at the 1997 world championships in Athens.

<HEADLINE> Private Economy Playing More Important Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Local officials in China are
pleased to find that revenue from private businesses has accounted
for a bigger portion of city income in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Private businesses in Shanghai, China's leading industrial and
commercial city, reported over 4.878 billion yuan (about 576
million U.S. dollars) in revenue in 1999. East China's Shandong
Province, the country's third-largest economic giant, received 13.
7 percent of its local revenue coming from private businesses.
</P>
<P>
Even in Jiangxi, a comparatively poor province in east China,
taxes paid by private businesses made up 18.1 percent of the
province's total.
</P>
<P>
Insiders pointed out that the country's comprehensive reforms
of the State-owned enterprises (SOEs) have caused many of them to
close, which has made more room for private businesses to flourish.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the flexibility of private companies allows them
to be more competitive in the market.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from various provinces show that the rate of
increase in private businesses in all the country's provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities exceeded China's overall
economic growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Private businesses in Shandong Province realized a 20.1 percent
increase in added value last year, 10 percentage points higher
than the average.
</P>
<P>
China's private individual businessmen and enterprises were
granted legal status in the 1980s, and both groups have developed
rapidly in the years since.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November last year, the number of registered
private individual businessmen and private enterprises of the
country exceeded 33 million, employing 100 million people,
according to statistics provided by the State Administration for
Industry and Commerce (SAIC).
</P>
<P>
In tandem with the expansion of their business scale and
improvement of management, China's private businesses have
actively participated in the reform of the State economy. In
Shandong Province alone, 1,819 State-owned enterprises were bought,
acquired, leased or part of their shares were bought by the
private businesses in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Statistics of the SAIC show that some 4,000 laid-off workers
from the SOEs are employed by the private sector everyday across
China.

<HEADLINE> ADB Predicts Faster Growth for Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine economy is poised
to grow at a faster rate in 2000 as the country continues its
recovery back from the regional crisis, the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) said Friday in its Asia Recovery Report.
</P>
<P>
"The impetus for growth must come from private investment and
consumption, since high debt levels and the government's
commitment to fiscal consolidation leave limited scope for fiscal
pump priming in 2000," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The country suffered fewer economic and social upheavals than
some regional neighbors but the impact has still been significant,
the report added.
</P>
<P>
Among the country's key economic indicators for 1999, gross
domestic product (GDP) grew by 3.2 percent while inflation rate
averaged 6.6 percent for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine peso was broadly stable during the year but has
lost about 35 percent of its value against the U.S. dollars since
July 1997 when the crisis began, the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The stock market gained slightly in 1999, but lagged behind the
stellar performances of some other Asian countries and investor
confidence has suffered significantly following an alleged
financial scandal in February, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the government's fiscal deficit rose to
about 3.7 percent of GDP in 1999, puffed up by enlarged
expenditure, revenue collection shortfalls and deterioration of
the financial position of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
A relatively strong banking system prevented a crisis in the
sector, but structural weaknesses have to be addressed, including
strengthening supervision and enhancing prudential standards, said
the report.

CANBERRA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
higher for the third consecutive day by trading at 61.54 U.S.
cents from 61.22 in the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Australia Bureau of Statistics showed
an unexpectedly rise in new jobs in February and a decade-low in
unemployment rate. The data reinforced expectations that the
Reserve Bank of Australia would raise official interest rates
before July.
</P>
<P>
The market worried that any increase in the Australian and U.S.
interest rate differential would discourage overseas investment in
Australian dollar bonds and deposits.
</P>

the Australian dollar closed at 0.6365 euro from 0.6367

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Navy to Get 1st Offshore Patrol Vessel by 2004 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Malaysian Navy (
RMN) expects to take delivery of the first of its six offshore
patrol vessels from a local privatized dockyard in four years'
time, Defense Minister Najib Tun Razak said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Penang Shipping Corporation-Naval Dockyard Sdn Bhd (PSC-
NDSB), which was awarded the contract for the vessels, is
finalizing the preliminary design by the end of the month, he told
reporters after visiting the RMN base and the PSC-NDSB complex in
Lumut, some 290 kilometers northwest from here, according to
Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
The PSC-NDSB is working with a German consortium to undertake
the project.
</P>
<P>
The design would be sent to an international body based in
Germany for certification by the end of April and upon securing
the international certification, the construction of the first
vessel would take place in Germany, Najib said.
</P>
<P>
Najib said the second vessel would be built in Germany while
the other four at the PSC-NDSB dockyard in Lumut.
</P>
<P>
The PSC-NDSB would send 174 staff to Germany for training in
order to get technical expertise to build the third and the rest
of the vessels locally using five modules to be brought to
Malaysia under a technology transfer arrangement, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
The PSC-NDSB was expected to deliver all the sixth vessels to
the RMN by 2007.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government awarded the PSC-NDSB the contract
worth 5.35-billion ringgit (about 1.407 billion U.S. dollars) in
September 1998 over seven-and-a-half years.
</P>
<P>
Najib said replacing decommissioned vessels was part of the
proposed upgrading of the RMN under the Eighth Malaysia Plan (2001-
2005).

<HEADLINE> China's Youth Organization Wins ESCAP Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The All-China Youth Federation
won the 1999 ESCAP Human Resources Development (HRD) Award for
Youth Empowerment, an award given annually by the United Nations
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP),
an ESCAP press release said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Each year, ESCAP's HRD Award focuses on a different theme,
which in 1999 was youth empowerment.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Youth Federation was selected as the winner
because of "its wide range of human resources development
activities for youth, covering many diverse areas of youth
development, and the impact of those activities on young people at
both the national and local levels," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The Federation was also commended for the high level of youth
participation in its programs, the release added.
</P>
<P>
Youth, defined by the United Nations as the age range of 15 to
24 years, make up about 20 percent of the population of Asian and
Pacific countries.
</P>
<P>
"They bear a disproportionate burden of unemployment, with
young women, school leavers and drop-outs being particularly
vulnerable. Millions of young people still lack access to basic
education and other skills," the release said.
</P>
<P>
"Empowering young people means creating and supporting
conditions under which young people can contribute to the economic,
social and cultural advancement of their societies and gain self-
fulfillment," it said.
</P>
<P>
ESCAP received applications and nominations for the 1999 Award
from 83 individuals and organizations in 24 countries throughout
Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The Award will be presented to the All-China Youth Federation
during the 56th ESCAP Commission Session to be held in Bangkok in
June.

<HEADLINE> China's First Securities Firm Expected to Go Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Hongyuan Trust and Investment
Company, Ltd., a publicly listed business in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, may become China's first listed
securities firm.
</P>
<P>
The company's board of directors announced that the China
Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has approved, in principle,
its plan to restructure itself as a securities firm.
</P>
<P>
The firm, controlled by the China Xinda Trust and Investment
Company, was listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 1994 as one
of the few listed financial firms in China.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 interim report of the company showed that income from
its securities business accounted for 78 percent of its operating
income.
</P>
<P>
Starting early last year, the CSRC has given approval to some
15 securities companies to increase their equity capital, but
securities firms want to go a step further and list themselves on
the country's stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, the Chinese Ministry of Finance issued a
regulation on the financial management of securities firms, which
provides that they can issue stocks, thus removing the legal
barriers to their listings.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 900 firms listed on the stock exchanges
in Shanghai and Shenzhen, but none of them are securities firms.
Analysts say that allowing securities firms to go public will not
only make them financially stronger, but will also attract
diversified capital into the stock market, hence promoting the
development of China's stock market and financial market.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, Zhang Kejian, who is attending the
ongoing Third Session of the Ninth National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the country's
top advisory body, has made a proposal to the conference on the
listing of securities firms.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that some of these firms have begun preparations
for their listing.

the exhibition, according to organizers.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government said
Friday that it will operate the Jakarta Futures Trading Bourse (
BBJ) that will engage in agriculture products trading starting in
July.
</P>
<P>
"The bourse will also engage in forestry and mining products,
services as well as goods produced by upper stream industries,"
Head of the Commodity Future Trading Supervisory Board (Bappebti)
Arifin Lumban Gaol said.
</P>
<P>
The bourse is very useful not only to protect the interest of
local farmers and small-scale entrepreneurs, but also to protect
the prices of the country's commodities which are now traded in
international market, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of free trade will entail great price risks
since the government will no longer intervene in any efforts to
stabilize price," Lumban Gaol added.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1998 reform package, all the commodity trading system
has been left to the market mechanism, with the exception of rice
based on the agreements of the World Trade Organization (WTO),
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and ASEAN Free Trade Area
(AFTA) in which Indonesia is a member.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila Strives to Stabilize Local Bourse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- After the Philippine Stock
Exchange (PSE) narrowly avoided the trading-stop fate on Wednesday,
the Philippine government began to take measures to stabilize the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was triggered by mass resignation of members of the
exchange's Compliance and Surveillance Group (CSG) Tuesday in
protest against a "cover-up" in the PSE investigation of the
alleged price manipulation and insider trading of BW Resources
Corp.
</P>
<P>
The mass resignation prompted Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) Chairman Perfecto Yasay to order the suspension
of trading for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the four associate commissioners of the SEC went
against Yasay Wednesday morning, declaring his Tuesday order
suspending trading at the PSE "null and void" since the order was
not approved and signed by a majority of its commissioners.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Jose Pardo, Trade and Industry Secretary Mar
Roxas and Central Bank Governor Rafael Benaventura rang the bell
Wednesday morning signaling the start of trading.
</P>
<P>
"The opening of the stock exchange sends a strong signal to
investors that the government is committed to fostering a stable
and predictable business policy environment," Roxas said.
</P>
<P>
Investor confidence, analysts said, has been seriously hurt by
the episode although the stock exchange opened as usual. Share
prices fell to a 15-month low on Wednesday, with the PSE composite
index ending with a 2.78 percent loss from the day before.
</P>
<P>
Since Wednesday, the Philippine government has taken a series
of measures to rebuild investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
First, Philippine President Joseph Estrada formally accepted
Thursday the resignation of SEC Chairmen Yasay in a bid to settle
the controversy between the president and the chairman.
</P>
<P>
Yasay claimed before a Senate hearing that Estrada has
pressured him to clear Dante Tan, head of BW Resources Corp., of
any wrongdoing in the stock market scandal.
</P>
<P>
"Please be informed that the president has accepted your
resignation effective March 2, 2000," said a letter to Yasay
signed by Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora.
</P>
<P>
Before formally accepting Yasay's resignation, Estrada has
already named Trade Undersecretary Lilia Bautista as Yasay's
replacement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Estrada urged Congress to speed up the
passage of a new securities act aimed at promoting a more
transparent and stronger stock exchange in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The PSE remains a membership club controlled by stockbrokers in
the Philippines. To restructure the PSE, the president called on
lawmakers to adopt models in Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia
where the public has majority ownership of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
"We should emulate the Singapore or Hong Kong or Australian
model. There will be less chances of manipulation by brokers since
70 percent of the stock market would be publicly owned," he said.
</P>
<P>
Congress leaders assured Estrada that the proposed Securities
Regulation and Enforcement Act will be passed before the start of
the Holy Week break on April 1. They also promised to accommodate
lessons learned from this week's controversy.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Justice Undersecretary Regis Puno said the
Department of Justice (DOJ) is geared up to investigate the
alleged insider trading and price manipulation involving
presidential associate Dante Tan and gaming firm BW resources Corp.
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, the DOJ is already considering the
composition of a prosecution team that will handle the probe.
</P>
<P>
Puno assured the public there will be no whitewash, and all
parties will be given the opportunity to prove and refute charges
of violating the Philippine law.
</P>
<P>
Another DOJ source said the DOJ is already looking at the
possibility of investigating respondents for economic sabotage.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, fraud involving more than 50 million pesos (1.25
million U.S. dollars) could be considered economic sabotage.
</P>
<P>
Based on the earlier findings of the CSG, Tan allegedly amassed
a "whopping 820 million pesos (21 million dollars)" in the buying
and selling shares of the gaming firm.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has taken the said measures to build
investor confidence, the negative mood in the local bourse still
persisted in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the 33-share main index drifted 12.84 points down
to 1,629.95 points, the lowest level since October, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The main index shed another 5.33 points on Friday to close at
1621.62 points. The index is now 24 percent down from its end-1999
level, with a market capitalization loss of about 6 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
As some analysts pointed out, it will take more time for the
local bourse to recover from the crisis.

<HEADLINE> 2nd Global Knowledge Conference closes in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The second Global Knowledge
Conference (GKII) in Malaysia Friday launched a Global Action Plan
at the end of its four-day conference.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 people from 120 countries and regions
representing the public and private sectors participated in the
GKII conference hosted by the Malaysian government and the Global
Knowledge Partnership (GKP).
</P>
<P>
Presenting the Action Plan at the end of the conference, GKP
official Marlee Norton, said: "Everyone who participated in this
process played an important, valuable role in helping refine the
Global Knowledge Partnership's vision and immediate future
activities."
</P>
<P>
"The Action Plan is the result of a process of interaction and
learning by GKP Partners and a consensus on the priorities for
action over the next two to three years, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Actions fall into two main categories -- one is GKP
Strategic Corporate Initiatives, generally projects of the
partnership as a whole, the other is regular GKP initiatives which
involve a group of partners interested in specific issues.
</P>
<P>
The input for the Action Plan came from a variety of sources
including three working groups on access, empowerment and
governance respectively, cross-cutting issues groups on gender,
youth, media and local knowledge, the Global Knowledge Forum, and
the Action Summit, she said.
</P>
<P>
"The GKP is committed to ensuring that the Action Plan is a
flexible and living instrument and that we have mechanisms for
continuously updating it and monitoring progress," she said.
</P>
<P>
She outlined 17 action items around which there is consensus
and significant interest on many of the people who gathered here
Friday. Over a dozen organizations and individuals have signed on
to pursue each of these action items.
</P>
<P>
They included: an initiative to develop global and regional
portals for sharing local content to counterbalance the heavy
influence of the 'North' currently on the Internet;
</P>
<P>
Creating innovative financing such as venture capital funds so
that local innovators can drive the ICT marketplace in their
countries;
</P>
<P>
An initiative to integrate technology skills into schools and
informal education systems to build skills needed to compete in
today's high tech economies;
</P>
<P>
To provide a permanent home and resources to continue the Youth
Building Knowledge Societies (YBKS) discussion list.
</P>
<P>
This electronic youth discussion was set up to provide input
from youth from around the globe to the GKII conference. It has
proven to be a powerful tool, as over 350 young people have
already been able to share their ideas and experience on using
ICTs to promote change in their communities.
</P>
<P>
The Action Plan will help guide the Partnership's actions over
the next several years and the actions selected will represent
areas where the participants believe that they can have an impact,
she said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Launches Anti-Crime Elite Squad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian police Thursday launched a
new elite anti-crime team in the country's economic capital Lagos.
</P>
<P>
The team, named the Dragon Squad and with an outfit of 30 new
Toyota Hilux patrol jeeps in Lagos, will operate in support of
the state government-sponsored police rapid response squad, The
Guardian newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The squad will also be launched in the country's capital Abuja
soon, the report quoted head of the new force Samuel Okanla as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"This project is for Lagos and Abuja. We shall focus on these
two cities and spread it to other states depending on the
availability of funds," said police spokesman Young Arabamen here
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We are expecting more sophisticated equipment which would soon
be in use," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Security is the responsibility of the Nigeria police force and
we are doing our best to achieve results although we need the
cooperation of every Nigerian to be virile and more effective," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Since taking over power from the military regime last May,
Nigeria's new civil administration has been taking measures to
strengthen the police force so that it can shoulder up
responsibilities traditionally undertaken by the armed forces.

<HEADLINE> China, Thailand Sign WTO Accord (Details Added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China and Thailand signed an
agreement here today on China's accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, China's minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, inked the agreement with visiting Thai Deputy Prime
Minister and Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi.
</P>
<P>
With China completing bilateral negotiations with Colombia and
Thailand in the last few days, Shi noted, the process of entry
into the WTO has been noticeably accelerated.
</P>
<P>
There now remain some ten WTO members who have yet to sign
bilateral deals with China, and a handful of these countries have
already closed or are about to close talks with China, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
"China's WTO accession has entered the final stage, and it won'
t be long before China becomes a member of the world trade body,"
according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Supachai Panitchpakdi reiterated Thailand's support for China's
bid to enter the WTO, saying that the agreement signifies that the
Chinese economy is part of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Supachai Panitchpakdi, who will succeed Michael Moore as
director-general of the WTO in 2002, said he expects China to
become a WTO member before the next round of multilateral trade
talks starts.
</P>
<P>
China is making rapid headway by concluding most of the
bilateral agreements with interested parties needed to qualify
China for WTO membership before the new round can be launched, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
China's future role in the WTO will help create more
understanding between member states and bring about more equality
in the allocation of benefits, as well as promote the causes of "
less privileged countries," said the future WTO chief.

<HEADLINE> Northern China Cities Report Worse Air This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The quality of air in most major
northern China cities worsened this week due to a massive invasion
of airborne dust into the cities from the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region and Shanxi Province earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
In its weekly Air Quality Report issued today, the China
Environmental Monitoring Center said stronger winds brought about
by cold air currents late this week helped disperse air pollutants
over those cities.
</P>
<P>
From March 3 to 9, 16 cities, including Zhengzhou, Urumqi,
Hohhot, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, and Xi'an, reported slight air
pollution, while Beijing reported unhealthy air quality, and
Yinchuan in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
reported hazardous air quality.
</P>
<P>
Six cities in southeastern and southern China, including
Shenzhen, Beihai, Guilin, Haikou, Zhanjiang, and Xiamen enjoyed
excellent air.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan, Guangzhou, Harbin, Kunming, Shanghai, and 17 other
cities reported fairly good air.
</P>
<P>
Yinchuan, Beijing, Zhengzhou, and 33 other cities listed
suspended particles as the major pollutant. Sulfur dioxide was the
major pollutant in Changsha, Chongqing, Guiyang and Qingdao.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Minister on Settlement of Taiwan Issue (Writhru) (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When asked about a possible Lee Teng-hui visit to Japan, Tang
Jiaxuan said that the visit would fundamentally undermine friendly
and cooperative relations between China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Tang said he has noticed that some important political figures
in Japan including some ruling party members have been planning a
visit to Japan by Lee Teng-hui and that a so-called preparatory
committee for Lee's visit has been set up.
</P>
<P>
Saying Lee's advocating of Taiwan independence has fully
exposed his true nature of splitting China, Tang said if Lee
visits Japan, under whatever name or title, it would fundamentally
undermine Sino-Japanese relations and would not bring any benefit
to Japan. He urged the Japanese side to see clearly the ulterior
motives of Lee and recognize the severity and political
harmfulness of such a visit.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue has an important bearing on Sino-Japanese
relations, and the two countries have already reached a consensus
on the issue, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped Japan would develop Sino-Japan bilateral relations by
strictly following the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement,
the Sino-Japanese Treaty on Peace and Friendship, and the Sino-
Japanese Joint Statement issued during President Jiang Zemin's
visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Tang also said that Sino-French relations should not be
affected by the Taiwan issue, adding that it is impossible for
China to make any compromise and concession on matters of
principle such as the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that the Taiwan issue once caused troubles to
relations between the two countries, he said France should handle
the issue of selling a military satellite to Taiwan cautiously and
properly.
</P>
<P>
Urging an early settlement of the Taiwan issue, Tang said the
Chinese mainland may consider restarting talks with Taiwan if the
leader to be elected soon in the island has no coloring of Taiwan
independence and accepts the one-China principle.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the upcoming election in Taiwan, Tang said any
outcome of the election should not lead to Taiwan independence and
separation, but should be conducive to the development of cross-
Straits relations and the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"The election in Taiwan is a local election. Whatever the
outcome of the election is and whoever wins the election, it
cannot change the fact that Taiwan is an integral part of China,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"If the new leader in Taiwan indeed has no coloring of Taiwan
independence, and is willing to restart negotiations with the
mainland under the one-China principle, cross-Straits talks could
be taken into consideration," he said.

<HEADLINE> Wrap-up: Foreign Minister on China's Diplomatic Achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua)--- China has gone through a series
of challenges and made major achievements in the diplomatic field
last year, said Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference sponsored by the 3rd Session of the 9th
National People's Congress (NPC), saying that China has full
confidence in bringing about a new situation in diplomacy in 2000,
Tang said the Chinese government resolutely safeguarded the
country's sovereignty and territorial integrity and its national
dignity in 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has waged a forceful struggle against the acts of the
NATO that infringed upon its sovereignty, thoroughly exposed the
fallacy of the "two-state theory" fabricated by Lee Teng-hui, and
firmly adhered to the "one China" principle by defeating the pro-
independence and separatist activities in Taiwan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the friendly cooperation with other countries in
the world has enjoyed further development over the past year, Tang
said: "At the same time, China has also enjoyed a relatively-
stable surrounding situation," and a series of major events
occurred over the past year. Facing these events, China has
adhered to principles and upheld justice, which has won wide
acclaims from the international community."
</P>
<P>
China's international status has been further enhanced and its
impact in the world been expanded, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he outlined China's diplomatic work in the year 2000
in five major aspects, which are as follows:
</P>
<P>
First, China will work hard to safeguard world peace and oppose
hegemonism, and resolutely defend its sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
Second, it will further increase its mutual-trust and good-
neighborly relations with its neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Third, China will continue to enhance unity and cooperation
with other developing countries across the world and,
</P>
<P>
Fourth, it will uphold and maintain framework relations with
major world powers.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, the people of China will continue to work together with
the people of other countries to safeguard the objectives and
principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and other
generally-recognized norms and principles governing international
relations.
</P>
<P>
About 500 Chinese and foreign reporters attended the press
conference in the Great Hall of the People, which was televised
live by the Central People's Radio Station, China Central
Television and China Radio International.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Minister on Settlement of Taiwan Issue (Writhru) (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan urged here for an early settlement of the Taiwan issue,
saying "China's stance on the Taiwan issue is consistent, clear
and resolute."
</P>
<P>
"China's principles concerning the Taiwan question have
remained unchanged under the current circumstances," he said at a
press conference here sponsored by the ongoing session of the
Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Tang added the purpose for China to release the White Paper on
the Taiwan Issue is positive and is meant to announce to the world
that China's principles on the Taiwan issue including the eight-
point proposal made by President Jiang Zemin in that regard have
remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
It is very clear that the "three ifs" in the White Paper -- if
a grave turn of events occurs leading to the separation of Taiwan
from China in any name, or if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by
foreign countries, or if the Taiwan authorities refuse,
indefinitely, the peaceful settlement of cross-Strait
reunification through negotiations -- is consistent with the late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's idea about resolving the Taiwan
issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
In reviewing China's diplomatic achievements in 1999, Tang said
the Chinese government thoroughly exposed the fallacy of the "two-
state theory" proposed by Lee Teng-hui and resolutely adhered to
the "one China" principle by exposing and denouncing pro-
independence and separatism activities in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said if the Seventh Fleet of the United
States had not got involved in activities at the Taiwan Straits in
the early 1950s, the Taiwan issue would have already been settled.
"Why the Taiwan issue hasn't been resolved for so long is due to
foreign interference and obstacles from Taiwan separatist forces,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"What the United States has done toward Taiwan has fomented
separatist forces in Taiwan and the United States has unshirkable
responsibilities for this," he added.
</P>
<P>
The quantity and quality of the U.S.arms sales to Taiwan have
gone up, he said, adding the United States is also preparing to
provide a Theater Missile Defense (TMD) System to Taiwan and it is
to pass a Taiwan Security Enhancement Act.
</P>
<P>
"All these violate the three Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques and
have broken its commitment to 'Three-Nos'," he said.
</P>
<P>
Saying the Sino-U.S. relations and cross-Straits relations are
at an important and crucial stage, Tang urged the United States to
understand that what it is doing and saying on the Taiwan issue
directly concerns the development of Sino-U.S. relations, peace
and stability in Taiwan and the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Tang said China strongly demands that U.S. implement the three
Sino-U.S. joint communiques and the "Three-Nos" and not to provide
any TMD system or related technology, equipment, and coordinating
system to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. should prevent the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act
from being passed by its Congress and stop interfering in China's
internal affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also urged the U.S. government to honor
its "series of serious commitments" on the Taiwan issue and do
things to facilitate peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
"The 'One China' principle is a basic foundation and
prerequisite for the reunification of China and China will not
allow any separatist forces to split Taiwan from it in any form,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated that the settlement of the Taiwan issue
falls within China's internal affairs, pure and simple.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Releases Draft Plan on Poverty Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
released a preliminary report on its Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper aimed to put the country's economy on a growth track, the
East African Standard newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The policy paper contains such proposals as combating
corruption, allocating land for squatters, speeding up
privatization process, said the preliminary report released on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It also covers proposals for meeting the conditions set by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank earlier this
year for resumption of loans to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's economy has been in doldrums since 1997 when the IMF
suspended a 205-million-U.S. dollar loan to Kenya in protest
against poor governance and corruption in the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, corruption, one of the major causes of
poverty, has blocked efficient allocation of resources, undermined
investor confidence and increased the cost of doing business in
Kenya. To reduce corruption in public office, the draft paper
proposes a code of conduct for all civil servants to be in
operation by next year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government will settle 30,000 slum squatters in
30,000 plots with security of tenure, the report said, adding that
about one million people in the Kenyan capital Nairobi now live in
slums with a threat of being evicted any time.
</P>
<P>
The government will also hasten its privatization process by
selling off 26 strategic state corporations, including Kenya
Railway Corporation and Kenya Ports Authority, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Roughly 15 million Kenyans, or over half of the population, are
now living below the poverty line.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Belgian Firms to Develop All-Digital Cinema Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Texas Instruments (TI)
Thursday announced that it had signed an agreement with Belgium's
BARCO to develop, manufacture and market all-digital cinema
projection technology.
</P>
<P>
"This is an exciting announcement," said Bob England, senior
vice president and manager of TI's Digital Imaging division, "
because it adds another world class company to the list of
projector manufacturers, with whom we will be working to develop
digital cinema solutions based on our digital light processing (
DLP) cinema technology."
</P>
<P>
Terms of the agreement were not announced. However, TI will
make available to BARCO DLP cinema technology which will form the
heart of a new generation of all-digital cinema projectors,
according to a news release from the Dallas-based company.
</P>
<P>
The agreement opens a multi-billion-dollar market for BARCO as
more than 100,000 cinema screens around the world convert from
traditional film to digitally based projection systems over the
course of the next 10 to 20 years, said Sjoerd De Clerck, BARCO's
Digital cinema managing director.
</P>
<P>
TI signed a similar agreement with Christie Systems Inc. on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
TI's DLP cinema projection technology has already been exposed
to almost half a million movie-goers throughout the world. The
extensive field demonstrations began on June 18th, 1999 with all-
digital showings at two North American locations of "Star Wars:
Episode I -- The Phantom Menace".

<HEADLINE> China Speeds Up Development of Nationwide Power Grid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Three major power grids in
northern, southern, and central China will be set up and connected
with each other over the next ten years, and a nationwide power
grid will be created by 2020, according to the State Power
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
With the Three Gorges Power Station operational, 9,100
kilometers of transmission lines will be completed to connect the
power station with power grids in central and northern China, as
well as Sichuan Province, forming the Central China Power Grid
spanning 2,000 km from east to west, said Jiang Shaojun, director
in charge of the corporation's strategic studies and planning.
</P>
<P>
The power grid will serve as a link to grids in northern,
northwestern and southern China, and will be the center of the
nationwide power grid.
</P>
<P>
A 500-kv transmission line from Hebei to Liaoning provinces is
now under construction to connect grids in northeastern and
northern China. The two provinces, together with Shanxi, Shaanxi,
Jiangxi, Beijing and Tianjin, will finally be covered by the
Northern China Power Grid.
</P>
<P>
A southern power grid has now basically taken shape, based on
power grids in Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces
and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, the framework of various inter-
provincial power grids will take shape as part of the initial step
in building a nationwide power grid by 2020.

<HEADLINE> Food Poisoning Kills 10 in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Food poisoning has killed ten
people and sickened some 400 others across China since the
beginning of this year, according to the Ministry of Health (MOH).
</P>
<P>
Most cases were the result of mistakenly eating inedible
materials or toxins, such as nitrite and globefish. Intentional
poisoning was also responsible in some cases, said a MOH report.
</P>
<P>
Usually three grams of nitrite, a chemical material similar in
same appearance to table salt, is fatal, and when nitrite was
mistakenly used in cooking, four died and 220 others were affected
this year.
</P>
<P>
Three other people were killed and 11 were sickened after
eating globefish, a toxic fish in some rivers in China.
</P>
<P>
A MOH official said today the ministry has urged local health
departments to increase efforts to raise public awareness of the
risks of food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
"We'll co-operate with relevant departments to tighten the
control of the production and sales of nitrite, while taking
measures to make nitrite and table salt more clearly
distinguishable," said Zhao Tonggang of the ministry's department
of health law and supervision.
</P>
<P>
The MOH also published the results of a nationwide sample test
of the quality of meat products, including ham and bacon, which
indicated that about 94 percent of these products meet national
standards.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui's Possible Visit to Japan Would Undermine Sino- Japanese Relations: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The foreign minister made the remark when he was questioned by
a Japanese reporter at a press conference held by the on-going
Third Session of the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Tang said he noticed that some important political figures in
Japan including some ruling party members have been planning a
visit to Japan by Lee Teng-hui and that a so-called preparatory
committee for Lee's visit has been set up.
</P>
<P>
He said Lee has been advocating Taiwan independence and his
true nature of splitting China has already been exposed.
</P>
<P>
If Lee visits Japan, under whatever name or title, it would
fundamentally undermine Sino-Japanese relations and would not
bring any benefit to Japan, Tang said, stressing that the Japanese
side should see clearly the ulterior motives of Lee and recognize
the severity and political harmfulness of such a visit.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue has an important bearing on Sino-Japanese
relations, and the two countries have already reached a consensus
on the issue, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped Japan would develop Sino-Japan bilateral relations by
strictly following the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Joint
Declaration, the Sino-Japanese Treaty on Peace and Friendship, and
the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement issued during President Jiang
Zemin's visit to Japan.

"The election in Taiwan is a local election. Whatever the
outcome of the election and whoever wins the election, it cannot

"If the new leader in Taiwan indeed has no coloring of Taiwan
independence, and is willing to restart negotiations with the

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-led NATO should reflect
deeply on and draw lessons from what has happened in Kosovo so as
to avoid the reoccurrence of anything like it, Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a press conference sponsored by the on-
going Third Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC)
here today.
</P>
<P>
Nato's interference in Kosovo goes against the trend of peace
and development of the times, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the past 12 months since NATO began
interfering in Kosovo, the situation in the region has been
characterized by tensions and continuous conflicts. This has
proved that using force to interfere in a sovereign country under
the excuse of human rights has not only failed to protect human
rights in Kosovo, but also failed to resolve ethnic and religious
conflicts that have troubled the region for many years.
</P>
<P>
This has also proved that such principles of the United
Nations Charter as non-interference in other country's internal
affairs are far from being outdated, he said. On the contrary,
these principles still have great practical significance now.

BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China is still awaiting the

attack against the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last year, and to

The four requirements Tang put forward to the U.S.-led NATO

<HEADLINE> S.Korea, Malaysia Make Progress in Banking Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Malaysia are
making fastest progress in bank and corporate restructuring in the
wake of the regional financial crisis, but Indonesia remains
problematic, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"A government-led approach to restructuring the banking sector
has paid dividends in the two countries (South Korea and Malaysia)
as the proportion of non-performing loans (NPLs) to total loans
fell by late 1999," the bank said in its Asia Recovery Report 2000
which was released here Friday.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, NPLs in the two countries fell to around 10
percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Manila-based bank said that Thailand's more market-oriented
approach initially created uncertainty but now seems to be
delivering results, with NPLs falling from almost 50 percent to
about 38 percent in the space of six months in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Further reductions can be expected as growth consolidates in
Thailand in 2000, it said.
</P>
<P>
But the bank sad that Indonesia, which suffered worst in the
crisis, remains problematic, with most banks insolvent.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines was comparatively little affected by the crisis,
warranting no widespread bank reconstruction, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, there are some signs of stress in the banking
sector, with NPLs having risen until recently, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said that many of the factors that caused the crisis had
still to be addressed in the region, including lax prudential
standards, flouting of legal lending limits, excessive leveraging
by corporations abuses by majority shareholders, and political
interference in business decision-making.
</P>
<P>
In all the five countries most-affected by the crisis --
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and South Korea --
resolution of corporate debt is proceeding slower than bank
restructuring, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Further resources for bank re-capitalizations will be needed
in Indonesia and possibly also in Thailand," it said. "The fiscal
deficits in the Republic of Korea and Malaysia are of a more
modest scale and an economic recovery should help heal bank
balance."
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the private sector is being left to address
additional capital needs, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Over the longer term, the future safety of financial sectors
in the affected economies will depend on further strengthening
regulatory and supervisory systems, and improving banking and
corporate governance," it said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Tea Brokers Eye Pakistani Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka should reach a fast
track agreement for its tea trade with Pakistan despite the Indo-
Lanka free trade deal, tea brokers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
While the Pakistani market appears the most favorable for Sri
Lanka to make a breakthrough, "the one obstacle facing Sri Lanka
is heavy import duty," Asia Siyaka Commodities, a tea broker
organization, said in its weekly market report.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan annually imports directly and indirectly around 150
million kg of tea and could well absorb a further 15 million kg of
Sri Lankan tea displacing a component of its African intake, said
the brokers.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the Sri Lanka Tea Board has been trying to
penetrate the Pakistani market where there is no hostile producer
lobby as in India.
</P>
<P>
Indian tea traders had objected to import Sri Lanka tea in fear
of its performance which could be hit by a flood of imports from
Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Under the Indo-Lanka Free Trade Agreement which came into
effect on March 1, Sri Lanka can export 15 million kg of tea every
year to India at half the prevailing duty.
</P>
<P>
However, India remains unfamiliar territory and new entrants
could expect a hostile reception, said the brokers.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is the third largest importer of tea, second only to
Britain and Russia, and is expected to become the world's largest
consumer of tea within a decade.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka exported 30 million kg of tea to Pakistan in 1980 and
became the largest single exporter to that market then.
</P>
<P>
But in recent years Pakistan retail stores are flooded with
Kenyan tea which accounts for 45 percent of the market while Sri
Lanka's share has dwindled to about three percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year Pakistan imported 4.8 million kg of tea from Sri
Lanka, up from 3.2 million kg the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Take Safety Measures to Protect Foreign  Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To boost the country's image abroad as a safe and tourist-
friendly place to visit, TAT and other agencies concerned have
worked out a three-point action plan, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The plan includes giving tourists detailed advice and clear
instructions on how to protect themselves and avoid falling into
dangerous situation, encouraging private organizations and
government agencies to join hands in protecting tourists' lives
and valuables, and setting up a tourist rescue center and a
tourist service center.
</P>
<P>
Paveena Hongsakul, minister of Prime Minister's Office in
charge of TAT, said that TAT's instruction brochures will be
provided to tourists at Bangkok's Don Muang International Airport
soon.
</P>
<P>
Contents in the brochures will include how to travel safely,
how to use taxi and other transport services, how and where to go
camping, shopping and sightseeing and how to access to agencies
and authorities when help is needed.
</P>
<P>
TAT's measures came after a spate of vicious attacks on foreign
tourists recently.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, an Australian traveler was killed when
camping in the northern part of Thailand, while a British
freelance cameraman was mugged later by the driver of a taxi he
caught at the Don Muang Airport.

WELLINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-three New Zealanders

"This allows the chance to reduce the risk of spread to her
child," Dr. Nigel Dickson of the AIDs Epidemiology Group said.
</P>

"It also allows the opportunity for the mother to have
treatments that can prolong her life," he added.

<HEADLINE> Asia Recovers Faster Than Expected, But Reform Must  Continue: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
said Friday that Asia's economic recovery from a regional
financial crisis is proceeding faster than expected, but reforms
must continue to keep the momentum.
</P>
<P>
In its Asia Recovery Report 2000 which was released here, the
Manila-based bank said the countries most affected by the crisis
that hit the region in July 1997 have been recovering at different
paces since late 1998 or early 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The republic of Korea has fared the best, posting a gross
domestic product (GDP) growth of 10.2 percent for 1999. The figure
for Malaysia is 5.4 percent, while Thailand grew by 4 percent and
the Philippines by 3.2 percent. Indonesia's growth was positive
but slow," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said that by end-1999, South Korea's GDP per capita exceeded
its previous peak, and the Philippines, which had the least ground
to make up, may regain or exceed its most recent peak by the end
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia may take another two years, with full recovery of lost
income taking even longer in Thailand and Indonesia, it said.
</P>
<P>
"What has consistently set the economies of the region apart
from others is their capacity for recovery," the bank said. "In no
small part, this has been due to the resilience of their economic
structures and the pragmatic policies of their governments. These
factors also play a part in explaining the ongoing recovery."
</P>
<P>
The ADB said that Asia's recovery is expected to be
consolidated and strengthened in 2000, driven mainly by domestic
demand and favorable conditions in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
Growth is expected to accelerate in Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines and Thailand, though South Korea could slow slightly
to 6-7 percent, after its pronounced recovery in 1999, the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the asset markets spearheaded the recovery, with
exchange rates and equity valuations leading the way, but property
markets remain depressed.
</P>
<P>
"Contagion and financial volatility in the global economy seem
to have faded through 1999, and the affected countries of Asia are
now in a much better position to withstand any future shocks," the
bank said.
</P>
<P>
But it warned that calls for a slower pace of reform should be
resisted because a "growth first" approach is risky and may
invited a recurrence of problems.
</P>
<P>
If reforms are continued, in the longer term, the crisis may
indeed appear to be a relatively moderate disturbance in Asia's
rise and dynamism, it said.

KUALA LUMPUR, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian and Indonesian
leaders will meet every six months for bilateral talks to further

Indonesians and the main political parties in the republic.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Rising Population Threatens Temples in Kathmandu Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The growing population and
increasing vehicles are having a tremendous impact on the
monuments and temples in the Kathmandu valley, the Kathmandu Post
Friday quoted an environmentalist as saying.
</P>
<P>
"With 1.2 million people now living in the valley and around
130,500 vehicles clogging narrow lanes, the impact on temples and
monuments are tremendous," said Anil Chitrakar of the Nepal
Heritage Society at a slide show of heritage sites Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Many of these temples were built during the Malla period (13th-
18th centuries) and were not designed to withstand such impact,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Many of the temples and monuments related to Buddhism and
Hinduism in the Kathmandu valley were listed as World Heritage
Sites by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, but some sites were de-listed from the list due to
poor conservation.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the de-listing, Chitrakar said, "the problem is
not with the main sites themselves but with surrounding buildings
which were being constructed in a modern way."
</P>
<P>
The Nepal Heritage Society has been working for the last 12
years to preserve some 2,200 heritage sites in the Hinduism
kingdom that was the origin of Buddhism and enjoys a harmonious co-
existence of the two religions.

LOS ANGELES, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Co., the world's
largest aircraft maker, will shed more workers this year as it
continues its plan to downsize, the company said in a news release
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Boeing should wind up with 180,000 to 190,000 employees at the
end of the year, compared with an earlier target of 185,000 to 195,
000 announced six months ago, the Seattle-based company said in
its annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a revised projection, and doesn't necessarily mean
that we will be laying off 5,000 people," said Boeing spokesman
Peter Conte, adding that the additional job cuts were not related
to the strike by engineers and technical workers of the Society of
Professional Engineering Employees of Aerospace (SPEEA).
</P>
<P>
Boeing has reduced its work force from about 228,000 to 194,100
workers over the past year. Conte said the company's annual
attrition rate is around 9,000 to 10,000 positions annually, which
will likely make up most of the additional cuts.
</P>
<P>
Most of the jobs will be trimmed through attrition and
reorganization, the company said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The aerospace giant, however, did say that an ongoing strike
could hurt earnings and further delay jet deliveries of aircraft
during the first quarter of 2000, and deliveries in the second
quarter may also be affected.
</P>
<P>
The total effect of the strike on deliveries, the results of
operations and financial position is uncertain, but could be
material depending on the strike duration, the nature of post-
strike recovery plans and the performance of other segments,
according to Wednesday's report.
</P>
<P>
SPEEA's 17,000 engineers and technical workers went on strike
about three weeks ago after management and the union failed to
agree on a new contract because of differences over pay and
benefits.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the company acknowledged that it had delayed
delivery of 15 of 42 commercial jets planned for February and was
considering shifting work to plants not affected by the labor
dispute.
</P>
<P>
SPEEA Executive Director Charles Bofferding said he hoped the
impact on the company's profits would spur Boeing to resolve the
conflicts.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Bodies Support PNTR for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Associations of U.S.
manufacturers and electronics have voiced their strong support for
the Clinton administration's proposed legislation for granting
China permanent normal trade relations (PNTR), and pressed the
Capitol Hill to act swiftly on the bill.
</P>
<P>
"The president himself has said this vote should be a no-
brainer and he is absolutely right," said Mike Baroody, senior
vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers,
immediately after President Bill Clinton sent the legislation to
Congress on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have to realize what this vote is all about -- whether the
U.S. is going to take advantage of the excellent commercial
agreement the administration struck with the Chinese government
last November," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that China will join the WTO no matter what we
do," he said. "The question is whether we choose to sit out the
race to enter the world's largest consumer market."
</P>
<P>
Baroody also quoted Leonard Woodcock, former president of the
United Auto Workers and U.S. envoy to China in the Carter
administration, as saying that "American labor has a tremendous
interest in China's trading on fair terms with the United States."
</P>
<P>
William T. Archey, president and CEO of the American
Electronics Association, said that his organization applauded
Clinton's call for speedy enactment of legislation granting China
PNTR, and "we strongly urge congress to act now on this critical
legislation."
</P>
<P>
"PNTR legislation will induce the greater opening of a market
of one billion people to American high-tech industry -- providing
potent new fuel for the very industry that has been the prime
engine of America's current unprecedented prosperity," Archey said
in a statement released on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He urged members of both political parties "to act in a
bipartisan spirit and serve the national interest by joining
together to approve PNTR status for China."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership
Council (DLC), the major think tank for the Democratic Party, also
issued a statement on Wednesday, praising the legislation for
China PNTR as good news for the American economy.
</P>
<P>
From said that "creating new markets for our goods and services
is essential if we are to continue to the economic boom of the
1990s," and "no market is potentially as large as China's."
</P>
<P>
"Rejecting or delaying PNTR would punish no one but the farmers,
workers and businesses that will benefit from major new access to
China's economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
From pledged DLC's "strongest efforts" to work with both
Democrats and Republicans in Congress "to secure passage of this
important piece of legislation."

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Develop Crops as Raw Materials for Industrial Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists from private
and public sectors have formed a research alliance to develop
options for soybeans and other agricultural crops to be used as
raw materials for producing plastics, chemicals and other
industrial products.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Chemical Company, a science and technology based firm,
said Thursday that the Oilseed Engineering Alliance is joining
scientists from the company, Michigan State University, Miami
University, Washington State University and the U.S. Department of
Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
"Researchers are pooling their expertise to improve traits of
special oils and fatty acids in soybeans, sunflower and other
crops," said the Down Chemical Company. Dow commits more than 10
million U.S. dollars to the alliance over a five-year period to
hire additional researchers and fund new initiative.
</P>
<P>
"Substituting raw materials based on crop-based oils for those
based on fossil fuels would mean not only more sustainable
alternative materials for manufacturing, but also better
environmental profiles for some industrial process," the company
said. "The research may also enhance the nutritional content of
the oils and uncover additional, innovative uses for them."
</P>
<P>
According to the company, the key to the research is the idea
that plants can easily perform chemistry that is difficult for
chemists with traditional processes. The research will aim to coax
plants to produce more fatty acids and oils that are more stable
and better suited to manufacturing needs. It could also make the
oils easier to extract, reducing the cost of plant oils as
compared to petroleum-based products.
</P>
<P>
It's a matter of combining nature's effectiveness with
technology's efficiency to encourage sustainability, said the
company.
</P>
<P>
Each individual researcher involved in the alliance will bring
specific expertise and skills to the project, while Dow adds a
better understanding of marketplace needs and expertise in
processing and commercialization to bring about competitively
priced products on renewable resources.

<HEADLINE> Lu Predicts Tough Olympics for Chinese Women Gymnasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lu Shanzhen, head coach of the women's team, said on Friday
that fierce competition is expected for China who may be laid open
to attack from front and rear.
</P>
<P>
Lu held Romania and Russia as the two obstacles China have to
overcome for the team title.
</P>
<P>
"Romania and Russia are both traditional powerhouses which have
consistently turned out world champions. They will block the
Chinese bid for the team title," said Lu at a Friday's winter
training quiz.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile other teams are piling pressure on China who needs to
underscore its reputation of finishing third at the team's
competition of the Tianjin World Championship last year.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and Ukraine often play the role of lucky
dogs in the Olympics, which have been evidenced by their results
in the past Games.
</P>
<P>
"The hosts Australia is taking on an aggressive look, they
ended up fifth while China third at the World Championship. This
time they will take full advantage of being hosts and regard China
as the main opponent," said Lu.
</P>
<P>
But the outside threat is not only what Lu is concerned about.
</P>
<P>
"As you know, we are always strong in uneven bars, but the
number of the first-rate gymnasts in the event is too small.
</P>
<P>
"Beam is another event we dominate, but win or loss is often
hard to forsee. We have a large number of gymnasts who have the
strength to win golds, but our advantage have been yoked for the
rule only allows two players from each country to enter the finals.
"
</P>
<P>
What comforts the head coach is the progress her charges have
made in vault, a sore spot for the Chinese female gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
"Judging from the performances in the winter training quiz, the
girls have done better, at least than what they did in the Tianjin
World Championships," said Lu.
</P>
<P>
Another good news for Lu is the comeback of veteran Kui
Yuanyuan, who may make up China's weakness in vault and floor.
</P>
<P>
Kui also offers a tonic for the Chinese team which featured a
mostly inexperienced girls to the World Championship last year.
</P>
<P>
"Her comeback maybe a good signal to the Olympic campaign," Lu
said of her charge. "And her form is on the rise."
</P>
<P>
Kui, who was sidelined from the World Championship last year for
injury, won a beam title in the Australian International Challenge
in Sydney last month.
</P>
<P>
"Considering her strength in the event, it is a normal thing for
her to win, but she has not restored her best form in the event,"
said Lu.

<HEADLINE> Schumacher Clockes Fastest in Practice Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Former world champion Michael
Schumacher topped the opening practice session on Friday for
Sunday's season-opening Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Despite an accident which tore a wheel off his Ferrari, the 31-
year-old German clocked the quickest time of one minute 32.130
seconds, bidding to end Ferrari's 21-year drought for its first
drivers' world title after South African Jody Scheckter triumphed
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Shumacher slidded off the track and into the barriers midway
through the afternoon, and was unable to resume, but his time,
after only 15 laps of the track, was good enough to keep him on
top as his rivals battled to improve.
</P>
<P>
Defending world champion Mika Hakkinen of Finland, in a McLaren,
was unable to improve on fourth place and spun on his last lap as
he attempted to clock a faster time.
</P>
<P>
His McLaren team-mate David Coulthard of Britain was second
fastest with Brazilian Rubens Barrichello in the second Ferrari
third on his first day of official action with the team.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Beats Poland in Olympic Field Hockey Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korea defeated Poland 4-1 for
its second straight victory in the Olympic field hockey qualifiers
in Osaka on Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, its coach Kim Sang-Ryul showed no mood of cheering,
lamenting that "we played stupidly" after his team missed several
scoring chances in the group A match.
</P>
<P>
"The quality of play was very poor. All the top teams in the
world make use of the slightest chance to score goals. The South
Koreans must do the same if we are to become a good team," Kim
said.
</P>
<P>
Kim further predicted that South Korea who struggled to beat
Belgium on Thursday, would face a tough time in Sunday's game
against Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Koreans led 2-0 at half-time through Hwang Jong-Hyun and
Yeo Woon-Kon in the 11th and 21st minutes.
</P>
<P>
After Eugeniusz Gaczkowski slammed in a penalty corner for
Poland in the second half, the Koreans dominated in the late
stages of the match, scoring two late goals after missing at least
four good chances.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, the former Asian champions, are among the favoured
teams in the 12-nation tournament which will send six qualifiers
to the Sydney Olympics in September.

<HEADLINE> Rising Population Threatens Temples in Kathmandu Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Growing population and
increasing vehicles are having a tremendous impact on the
monuments and temples in the Kathmandu valley, the Kathmandu Post
quoted environmentalists as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
"With 1.2 million people now living in the valley and around
130,500 vehicles clogging narrow lanes, the impact on temples and
monuments are tremendous," said Anil Chitrakar of Nepal Heritage
Society at a slide show of heritage sites Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Many of these temples were built during the Malla period (13th-
18th centuries) and were not designed to withstand such impact,"
he said, "the life of these temples and monuments are being
shortened."
</P>
<P>
Many of the temples and monuments related to Buddhism and
Hinduism in the Kathmandu valley were listed as World Heritage
Sites by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization. But some sites were de-listed from the list due to
poor conservation.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the de-listing, Chitrakar said "the problem is
not with the main sites themselves but with surrounding buildings
which were being constructed in a modern way."
</P>
<P>
Chitrakar was all praise for Bhakatpur municipality, 12 km east
of Kathmandu municipality, which was recognized as the World
Heritage City.
</P>
<P>
"There is at least one renovation taking place in the city at
any given time and this is because there is unity among the people
there for conservation," said Chitrakar.
</P>
<P>
Nepal Heritage Society is making efforts to change the
situation, such as offering subsidies to house owners to build the
facade in a traditional manner, according to Chitrakar.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal Heritage Society has been working for the last 12
years to preserve some 2,200 heritage sites in the Hinduism
kingdom that was the origin of Buddhism and enjoys a harmonious co-
existence of the two religions.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Launch Massive Phone Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will soon launch a massive
144-million-U.S.-dollar mobile phone project, one of the biggest
investments in the country since the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Global System for Mobiles (GSM) is expected to be
introduced in May, said the first issue of the Myanmar Times, the
country's newly-published international weekly journal.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Sky-Link Company, linked to Sky-Link Communications
Ltd, a British Virgins Islands entity, will handle installation of
the system before transferring to the state-run Myanmar Posts and
Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
According to the journal, altogether 70,000 phones and 30,000
phones will be respectively made available in Yangon and Mandalay,
the two major cities of Myanmar under the first phase.
</P>
<P>
The second phase, to take place within six months after the
completion of the first, is to make the system operational in 11
small towns where a total of 33,000 more mobiles can then be put
into the system and will enable people travelling between Yangon
and Mandalay to use their phones in any location.
</P>
<P>
With more than 225,000 fixed-line telephones and about 10,000
cellular mobiles at present, the introduction of the GSM system
will, in three years' times, increase by 50 percent phones in use
in Myanmar, currently estimated to stand at 0.44 to 0.66 per
hundred people, it said.
</P>
<P>
GSM phones offer better sound quality, provide new and improved
data transmission and has a sophisticated billing system.

<HEADLINE> Elephants Banished from Streets in Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bangkok Metropolitan
Administration (BMA) starts its crackdown on elephants roaming the
streets of the capital Friday, warning mahouts not to defy the ban
otherwise they will face serious penalties.
</P>
<P>
According to the ban, elephants found roaming and foraging for
food in the city would be apprehended and their mahouts charged.
In cases where a mahout escapes, his elephants will be considered
state property.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the ban has been planned for a long time
but faced stiff resistance from the mahouts.
</P>
<P>
About 13 elephants and their mahouts held a protest march
against the ban Monday. It was reported that up to 150 mahouts
with their elephants will repeat their protest in Bangkok next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, BMA officials insisted bringing elephants to Bangkok
is dangerous for men and beasts.
</P>
<P>
Last month, an elephant broke loose from its mahout and charged
down one of Bangkok's busiest street before a veterinarian used a
tranquilizer gun bringing it down.
</P>
<P>
Reports of elephants struck by cars are also nothing strange
for Bangkokians.
</P>
<P>
As natural food sources of elephants dwindle due to
deforestation, and their usefulness as menial labor and a means of
transportation has virtually been eliminated by technology,
elephants have been forced to enter the cities, where they are
essentially reduced to begging.
</P>
<P>
Typically, mahouts in Bangkok sell bananas and sugarcanes to
tourists who in return to feed elephants.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from Friends of the Asian Elephant, a
conservation group, there were 10,000 domesticated elephants in
Thailand at the turn of the last century, and many times that
number in the wild. Now, there are fewer than 5,000 in all, with
more than 300 roaming the streets of Bangkok and other major
cities of the country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. National Reports Better-Than-Expected Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Excluding one-time gains of 228 million dollars, National
Semiconductor earned 99.8 million dollars, or 51 cents per share,
according to reports from the chip maker.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expected the California chip maker to post an
operating profit of 45 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
Including the one-time gain, National reported a net income of
327.8 million dollars, or 1.68 dollars per share. That's compared
with a net loss of 27.2 million dollars, or 16 cents per share,
during last year's fiscal third-quarter.
</P>
<P>
Revenue during the quarter rose to 548.9 million dollars from
500.1 million dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Brian Halla, chief executive of National Semiconductor,
attributed the results to the company's focus on the market for
analog semiconductors, which are used for things such as
converting real-world signals such as images and sound into a
digital format and managing battery life on portable electronic
devices.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, Halla said he was enthusiastic about the
potential for the company's growth, considering the rising
forecasts for semiconductor demand.
</P>
<P>
In September, the industry had forecast a growth rate of a
little more than 20 percent. "Now, a lot of people are saying
better than 25 percent or better than 30 percent, and we certainly
feel as bullish as anybody right now," Halla said.
</P>
<P>
National Semiconductor, which last summer withdrew from the
highly-competitive market for PC microprocessors by selling its
Cyrix subsidiary, said its worldwide bookings during the most
recent quarter increased more than 30 percent over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Booking in its analog segment increased more than 40 percent
over the corresponding quarter a year ago, National Semiconductor
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves One-Dollar Hike in Minimum Wage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives voted Thursday for a one-U.S. dollar hike in the
minimum wage over two years and a 10-year Republican tax cut of
122 billion dollars intended to soften the impact on business.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton is threatening to veto the tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
The vote was 246-179 for a bipartisan amendment boosting the 5.
15-dollar-an-hour minimum wage by one dollar over two years. The
amendment replaced a Republican plan to increase the wage by one
dollar over three years. The rewritten bill then passed 282-143.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the House voted 257-169 for the Republican tax bill,
two-thirds of which consists of cuts in estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
The minimum wage and tax bills were to be melded together into
one package so House members could work out differences with the
Senate, which has passed its own version of a minimum wage
increase and tax package as part of a bill overhauling the nation'
s bankruptcy laws.
</P>
<P>
Many Democrats said the increase was long past due, noting that
average pay for corporate chief executive officers has risen some
750 percent since 1980, compared with only 68 percent for the
average worker. About 4 million workers are paid the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
Even if the bill meets Clinton's wish for a two-year wage boost,
the president Thursday reaffirmed that he would veto the measure
if it included large tax cuts. Clinton contends that the tax
relief disproportionately benefits the wealthy and would consume a
chunk of the projected budget surplus that could be used to shore
up Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
"Once again, the Republican leadership has derailed what should
be a simple vote on the minimum wage with a maximum of political
maneuvering," Clinton said. "Congress should send me a bill I can
sign, not one I have to veto."

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Police Hunts for Army Deserters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan military police
continued its islandwide operation to hunt for thousands of army
deserters still at large despite the expiry of a recent amnesty
for them to return, army sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the two-week amnesty between February 21 and March 5, a
total of 3,795 deserters had reported back for duty, said the
sources, adding that they have been absorbed back into the army
without any penalty.
</P>
<P>
The deserters still have chances to report for duty despite the
expiry of the amnesty, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday afternoon (March 8), another 574 deserters
reported back for duty as "absentees without leave." They would be
subjected to lesser punishment than the deserters apprehended by
the military police.
</P>
<P>
The government has conducted amnesties on many occasions since
1995. However, there are still thousands of deserters who failed
to respond to the amnesties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the army has also launched a new recruitment drive
which will continue till March 20. The number of new recruits has
been increased to 1,530 by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 100,000-strong army, plagued by desertion and manpower
shortage, is seeking to bolster its ranks to fight Tamil Tiger
rebels who are fighting a 17-year-old war for an independent
homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east.

<HEADLINE> Military Bodies Urged to Be Dissolved in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Following the decision of the
government to terminate the Coordinating Agency to Support the
Strengthening of National Stability (Bakorstanas), Speaker of the
House of Representatives (DPR) Akbar Tandjung urged other military
bodies to also be dissolved.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the termination of Bakorstanas, Tandjung said the
government should go one step further by excising Posko
Kewaspadaan (alert centers).
</P>
<P>
Alert centers were established in January 1997 under the
government of former president Soeharto to prevent possible riots.
The centers were set up in almost every military district.
</P>
<P>
He said that all extra constitutional bodies, such as
Bakorstanas, the Litsus (political screening procedures)
institution and alert centers, should be completely discarded.
</P>
<P>
"The alert centers have the same spirit as Bakorstanas, which
is to monitor people's activities," Tandjung was quoted by the
Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The presence of alert centers is contradictory to the nation's
democratic climate, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Tandjung, existing intelligence bodies such as the
State Intelligence Coordinating Board (Bakin) and the Military's
Strategic Intelligence Agency (BAIS) were sufficient.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday the government decided to disband Bakorstanas and
the Litsus institution which were set up by Soeharto when he was
in rule. Bakorstanas, which in past years was chaired by the
Indonesian Military chief, became infamous as part of the military
's vehicle to oppress outspoken political activists. The Litsus
institution is a government body which screens candidates for
government departments. The institution was used to prevent
Soeharto's critics from entering strategic positions.

<HEADLINE> China to Promote Emergency Contraception </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The State Family Planning
Commission will kick off a nationwide promotion of emergency
contraceptive options in April, according to a commission official.
</P>
<P>
The program will help make the public aware of the
contraceptive methods currently available, Fu Wei, an official
with the commission's technology department, was quoted by today's
China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
Fu expected Internet to play a role in the publicity effort
apart from newspaper and periodical advertisements.
</P>
<P>
Fu said, emergency contraceptives have been applied in China
for many years and the products have proven to be effective.
</P>
<P>
"A new emergency contraceptive product has been submitted to
the National Drug Administrative Bureau for a final approval,"
said Fu.
</P>
<P>
The new product can be taken within five days after unprotected
sex with an efficiency rate of 70 to 80 percent, whereas most
similar pills are only effective within 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
According to Fu, the State Family Planning Commission often
publishes articles on how to prevent pregnancy prior to Spring
Festival due to a rise in the number of abortions reported by
hospitals each year in the month following the holiday.
</P>
<P>
Many hospitals operate special hotlines offering instructions
and consultations at no charge. On January 28, China's first
emergency contraceptive center with a hotline was opened in
Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Director Wang Yiting of the center said they have an average of
30 call-ins every day and 50 percent come from people in other
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the calls showed that many callers knew little about
birth control methods and their bodies in general and some involve
people who are already pregnant.

<HEADLINE> Procurator-General Vows to Combat Crimes, Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING,March 10 (Xinhua) -- China's top prosecutor Han Zhubin
said here today that procuratorial bodies across the country will
intensify efforts in cracking down crimes, especially those
committed by officials, strengthen judicial supervision and
further streamline procuratorial mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Han, procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate (
SPP), defined the most important task for procuratorates in the
year 2000 as "to maintain social stability.
</P>
<P>
He made the pledge when delivering his annual report on the
work of the SPP to the ongoing Third Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Procuratorates will adhere to the "strike-hard" policy, which
means swift and harsh punishments, in dealing with criminal
offenses, he said, and enhance their capability in appropriately
tackling social conflicts.
</P>
<P>
In order to deal hard blows at the country's graft-busters,
procuratorial bodies will place crackdown on embezzlement and
neglecting of duties on the top of the agenda and focus on cases
involving high-level officials and large sum of money, according
to Han.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever involved shall be investigated to the very end and
brought to justice, with no exceptions, especially in the cases of
taking bribes and conniving at smugglers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Han went on to say that the SPP has promulgated several major
reforms in optimizing the work of procuratorates.
</P>
<P>
Under those reforms, prosecutors have to make public on their
progress in investigation and prosecution of "major and important"
cases, inform defendants, criminal suspects on their legal rights
before interrogation; individual prosecutors are entitled to more
power as well as given more responsibility for their performances;
and prosecutors and officials are subject to new competitive
mechanism; the SPP and many provincial procuratorates have invited
experts of various fields as counsels.
</P>
<P>
Han said that in the past two years, the SPP has launched
massive nationwide drives in educating prosecutors and enhancing
their political and proficiency levels.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to these efforts, 617 prosecutors were investigated for
violations of the law and discipline, 60.2 percent less than in
1998, Han said. Fifty-five of them were brought to court in new
capacity of defendants.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 1,886 unqualified prosecutors were transferred, 2,
156 officials in 1,062 local procuratorates removed and replaced

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Support "Grain-for-Trees" Plan (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Related farmers can receive compensation or grain allowances
when they return one hectare of farmland to woods or grassland.
The compensation or allowances will last until they find new means
in their living.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhibao, director of the State Forestry Administration,
said that this year about 343,000 ha of farmland in the western
areas will be turned back to forests and grassland. The state
will be responsible for grass seeds and seedlings.
</P>
<P>
The NPC deputies held that China's grain supply is sufficient
and there is ample grain reserves thanks to bumper harvests in
many consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Xu Youfang, secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee
of the Chinese Communist Party, said that the ecological project
will relieve the pressure of huge grain storage in China.
</P>
<P>
At present, the grain reserve in northeastern Heilongjiang
equals one year's grain output, he said, adding that his province
support the plan.
</P>
<P>
Yang Caishou, director of the Office of Poverty-Reduction in
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, said that the plan
is an effective way to alleviate poverty and better off local
farmers.
</P>
<P>
"When farmers turn their farmland into grassland and woodland,
they have no worry about their living and they will find other
ways to become rich," he said.
</P>
<P>
Involving nine provinces and municipalities and one
municipality, West China accounts for 56 percent of the country's
territory and half of the mineral resources.

<HEADLINE> NPC Session Holds Fourth Plenary Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing Third Session of the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature,
held its fourth plenary meeting here this morning to hear reports
on the work of the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's
Procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
Top Party and state leaders, including Jiang Zemin, Li Peng,
Zhu Rongji, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing were present at
the meeting, which was presided over by Wu Jieping, an executive
chairman of the session and an executive member of its Presidium.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Yang, president of the Supreme People's Court, delivered a
report on the work of the courts over the past year.
</P>
<P>
"The Supreme People's Court in 1999 focused on safeguarding
judicial justice, adhered to rigorous enforcement of the law, and
pushed ahead with reform of the court system," said the top
Chinese judge.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he said, the Supreme People's Court handled 5,768
second-instance, retrial and dealth penalty examination cases, of
which 5,544 have been concluded.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, local courts across China in 1999 handled a
total of 5.692 million first-instance cases, up 5.2 percent over
the previous year. Chinese courts concluded the trials of more
than 539,000 criminal cases, up 12.27 percent over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
More than 600,000 were given criminal penalties last year,
which represented an increase of 14.02 percent.
</P>
<P>
Courts across China in 1999 also handled a great number of
cases in which the involved parties applied for the enforcement of
court verdicts. More than 2.645 million such cases involving a
total of over 249.7 billion yuan were concluded according to law,
said Xiao, up 27.3 percent and 57.72 percent over 1998
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Chinese courts have uncovered 1,450 judicial personnel who
violated the law or disciplines, down 42.28 percent from 1998, of
whom 73 have been formally prosecuted, Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
Xiao said that among many reform measures to be taken this year,
the Supreme People's Court will start posting its verdicts online
or having them published by the media.
</P>
<P>
Courts will also make efforts to promote open trial in a bid to
guarantee judicial justice, reform its judge selection mechanism
to allow more talented legal professionals compete for positions
in courts.
</P>
<P>
In his report on procuratorial work to the NPC session, Han
Zhubin, procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate,
said that the past year has seen procuratorial bodies across the
country earnestly fulfill their duties and achieve new progress in
their work.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, China's procuratorial bodies issued warrants for
arresting 663,518 criminal suspects, and prosecuted 672,367, up 10.
9 percent and 15 percent over 1998 respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Last year procuratorial bodies across China investigated 38,
382 cases of embezzlement, bribery and dereliction of duty, up 9.4
percent from 1998," said the top Chinese prosecutor, adding that
through these investigations, the procuratorial bodies helped
retrieve direct economic losses worth 4.09 billion yuan for the
state.
</P>
<P>
As watchdogs for the judicial bodies, prosecutors across China
investigated 4,592 lawmen for abusing their power for personal
gains.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to raise the competence and quality of
procuratorates in the country, the Supreme People's Procuratorate
started a nationwide training program for all heads of county- and
prefecture- level procuratorates.
</P>
<P>
Six hundred and seventeen prosecutors were investigated for
violations of the law and discipline, down 60.2 percent from 1998,
Han said. Formal charges have been brought against 55 of them.
</P>
<P>
Han pledged that Chinese procuratorates will continue the fight
against criminal offenses for social stability and crack down upon
official corruption, strengthen supervision over law enforcement
and provide services for the overall economic development of the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said that individual prosecutors will be given more power as
well as be held more accountable for their prosecution decisions,
and prosecutors will be subject to qualification examinations and
competitions.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,722 NPC deputies attended today's plenary meeting.
Members of the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, China's top advisory body also
in session here since last week, attended the meeting as observers.

<HEADLINE> Procurator-General: China Intensifies Anti-Corruption Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua)-- Procurator-General Han Zhubin said
here this morning that China's procuratorates at all levels have
intensified an anti-corruption campaign and stepped up efforts to
deal with major cases in a bid to help build a clean and hard-
working government.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, procuratorates in the country dealt with graft,
bribery and malfeasance cases involving a large number of
officials, including three at the provincial level, 136 at the
prefecture-level and 2,200 at the county-level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another 7,725 graft, embezzlement cases each valued
at 50,000 yuan and more and 5,244 cases of misappropriation of
public funds each valued at 100,000 yuan and more have been
handled.
</P>
<P>
Han made the announcement in a work report of the Supreme
People's Procuratorate he delivered at the ongoing Third Session
of the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Last year, procuratorial bodies handled a total of 38,382 graft,
bribery and malfeasance cases, which recovered 4.09 billion yuan
in lost public money, Han said.
</P>
<P>
Procuratorates exercised the functions of approving arrests and
bringing charges according to law and cracking down on criminal
activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, procuratorial departments approved the arrest of 663,
518 suspects and filed formal charges against 672,367, with the
extra suspects being left over from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with law, procuratorates requested police
department to explain on 16,306 cases of failure to file for
investigation and notified the latter to file 7,705 cases, Han
said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, procuratorates also made efforts to prevent mistaken
arrests and prosecutions as well as failures to arrest and
prosecute, he said.
</P>
<P>
Procuratorates made decisions against the arrest of 104,199
people and the prosecution of 16,172 people; they also decided to
pursue for arrest 9,083 people and for prosecution 4,242 people.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Han said, procurators challenged 3,759 criminal
judgments which they believed to be incorrect, and challenged
court verdicts for 14,320 cases on civil, economic, administrative
judgments and rulings.
</P>
<P>
The procuratorates also raised views on 8,229 cases for the
correction of irregularities by relevant departments involving
matters including commutation, parole and temporary serving a
sentence outside prison under surveillance and have corrected 6,
262 cases, according to the Procurator-General.
</P>
<P>
The procuratorates also investigated 4,592 persons working in
judicial departments who were suspected of abusing their power.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices to Drop: Mexican Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices worldwide
will fall in April with a possible surge in the supply of
petroleum, Mexican Energy Minister Luis Tellez Kuenzler said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that once an agreement is reached on boosting oil
output by the oil-producing nations, the price of Mexico's mix,
which dipped Wednesday to 27 U.S. dollars a barrel from Tuesday's
29.27 dollars, is expected to fall two or three dollars to about
24 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Saudi Arabia also sent signals of stabilizing world
oil prices on Wednesday when their oil ministers met in Riyadh.
Experts believe that OPEC will agree on an output hike to reduce
soaring international petroleum prices during a March 27 OPEC
meeting in Vienna, Austria.
</P>
<P>
Tellez stressed Mexico needs price stability in crude, one of
its economic mainstream, while oil prices rocket worldwide, with
those in the U.S. climbing over 34 dollars a barrel this week, the
highest since November 1990.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela led an effort to streamline
supplies by about 5 million barrels a day beginning in March 1998
to salvage collapsing oil prices, the accord will expire on March
31. A new one may be worked out in Vienna, experts speculated.

<HEADLINE> Online Trading Continues to Catch On in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of U.S. online
traders has risen from 2.7 million in May 1999 to 3.5 million in
January this year, up 30 percent, according to a study released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The study conducted by U.S. marketing information firm J.D.
Power and Associates found that the new entrants into the online
trading market are primarily baby boomers with investment
portfolios of 100,000 U.S. dollars or more. The new online traders
are evenly divided between the full-service firms that offer
online trading service and firms whose primary business is online
trading.
</P>
<P>
Among all online traders, the firm said, the average portfolio
size increased 32 percent to 157,000 dollars during the eight-
month period between original and interim reports.
</P>
<P>
Another notable finding of the study is that one-stop shopping
service has not yet been in favor of online investors. Only 15
percent of study respondents use their online trading firm as a
source for virtually all their financial needs; and of the new
entrants into the market, only 12 percent use their firm in this
way.
</P>
<P>
The study is based on direct consumer feedback from a
representative sample of 6,700 online investors nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Online stock trading is also growing fast in Europe. According
to an earlier research by Datamonitor, a Europe-based market
analysis firm, in the average workday, 466 new online accounts are
opened in Sweden, 685 in Britain and 1,178 in Germany.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Secretary of Commerce Urges Quick Move on China PNTR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua)- U.S. Secretary of Commerce
William M. Daley said Thursday China is America's most important
relationship on all levels and that the Congress should move "as
quickly as possible" to grand it the Permanent Normal Trade
Relations (PNTR).
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely critical that we move quickly," Daley told a
breakfast of insurers sponsored by the American Council of Life
Insurance (ACLI) in Washington D.C. just after President Bill
Clinton presented to the Capitol Hill a piece of legislation
calling for giving China a permanent normal trade status on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The legislation "would make permanent what has already been in
effect for 20 years, normal trade ties with China," Daley said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that as the November elections are approaching and
the campaign is heating up, it would get tougher "with each
passing day" to get the PNTR legislation through the Capitol Hill,
where some Congressmen have stood up against the proposed trade
status with China due to a variety of reasons.
</P>
<P>
But Daley voiced his optimism about an early vote. "We are very
hopeful that Congress will move quickly on the legislation,
beginning with the Senate Finance Committee. We would expect a
final vote before the end of May, when Congress recesses for
Memorial Day," he said.
</P>
<P>
Daley said that it is "in everybody's interest" to move the
PNTR bill through Congress, and "to do so as quickly as possible."
</P>
<P>
"All of you are aware of the benefits of the China trade deal
our negotiators hammered out last fall. It smoothes the way for
China to join the WTO. It opens many markets, from agriculture to
telecommunications to insurance," he told the business leaders.
</P>
<P>
Daley said the U.S. needs to "think more about the big picture"
when considering the WTO and PNTR issue.
</P>
<P>
"China is our most important relationship on all levels,
strategic and economic. And, in my opinion, that will be the case
for many years to come. China is a rising world power not to be
ignored," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In today's new economy, in today's global economy, we cannot
neglect our role as a world leader," he added.
</P>
<P>
Daley said the failure to normalize trade ties with China would
send out "a very negative message" that "American no longer wants
to lead," and that "we fear a country that has an economy just one-
tenth the size of ours."
</P>
<P>
"That is why the President is investing so much time on this,
and why we absolutely must win this fight, as I believe we will,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Carroll A. Campbell, ACLI President and CEO, applauded the
administration's effort for China PNTR after President Clinton
delivered a speech on that issue at the Johns Hopkins School of
Advanced International Studies here in Washington on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Both U.S. and Chinese businesses and consumers can gain
enormous benefits through open and competitive trade relations,"
he said. He urged Congress "to enact, at the earliest possible
date, legislation to provide China with PNTR."
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five life insurance company CEOs are now in Washington
for high-level meetings at the White House and on Capitol Hill on
Thursday to press for China PNTR. Those meetings are scheduled to
take place after Commerce Secretary Daley addresses the CEOs at
the breakfast Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's White House and Congress meetings followed up a
February 29 letter to Congressional leaders signed by 18 life
insurance industry chief executives supporting China PNTR.
</P>
<P>
"Without PNTR, American businesses will be unable to enjoy the
benefits of China's WTO commitments, potentially placing the U.S.
in an inopportune trade position in comparison with other WTO
member countries such as the European Union and Japan," the
business tycoons said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
They also argued that not giving PNTR to China means fewer
business opportunities for American entrepreneurs, companies and
workers.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 ACLI member companies have representative offices
in China and have been working for years for a liberalized Chinese
market. If U.S. Congress approves PNTR for China, according to an
ACLI news release, American businesses would secure the benefits
of the U.S.-China WTO trade agreement signed last November, under
which China's insurance and pension markets could be open to the U.
S. as early as 2003.

<HEADLINE> Two Youth Hackers Caught in Hungary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian Police announced
Thursday that two young hackers who broke into the website of an
Internet service company in January has been caught.
</P>
<P>
Szabo Csaba, chief of the Anti-Organized Crime Department,
disclosed at a press conference that the two computer pirates,
aged 15 and 19 respectively, were tracked down through their e-
mail system by the police.
</P>
<P>
Csaba added that the young hackers had admitted their criminal
act. If found guilty, they could face imprisonment as high as 5
years.
</P>
<P>
In mid-January this year, the website of the second largest
Internet service company in Hungary was tapped into twice. The
hackers downloaded customers' information and files saved in the
company's computer system and posted the login numbers and
passwords of some two thousand people. The company was forced to
shut down its service for dozens of hours, suffering an economic
loss of 10 million Forints (about 40,000 dollars).

<HEADLINE> Bradley, McCain Quit U.S. Presidential Race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Former New Jersey Senator Bill
Bradley and Arizona Senator John McCain dropped out of the U.S.
presidential campaign Thursday, paving the way for Vice President
Al Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush to win their parties'
presidential nomination, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
"The vice president and I had a stiff competition and he won,"
Bradley said at a press conference in New Jersey. "I will support
him in his bid to win the White House."
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he had telephoned Gore to tell him the decision. "
Now it's the time for unity," he said, calling on Democrats to
unite around Gore to win the general election in November.
</P>
<P>
"This country needs Democratic leadership and I will work to
ensure a Democratic White House and Congress," he said, but he
made it clear that he would not join Gore as his vice presidential
running mate.
</P>
<P>
Bradley said that although he has decided to withdraw, he will
hold the 412 delegates he won to give them a voice at the
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles in August. Gore has
the support of 1,424 delegates.
</P>
<P>
"We have been defeated, but the cause for which I ran has not
been defeated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bradley made the decision to quit the White House race after he
was defeated in all the 18 primaries and caucuses the Democrats
have held so far, and one day after he received a final blow in
the sweeping Super Tuesday contests.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Bradley's withdrawal to endorse his rival Gore,
Republican Senator McCain did not pledge his endorsement to Bush.
</P>
<P>
"A majority of Republican voters made clear their preference
for president is Governor Bush. I respect their decision," McCain
said at a press conference in his home state of Arizona, shortly
after Bradley's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"I am no longer an active candidate for my party's nomination
for president. I congratulate Governor Bush and wish him and his
family well," he said. " He may very well become the next
president of the United States."
</P>
<P>
McCain was defeated in the Republican Super Tuesday primaries
and caucuses, setting the stage for an autumn showdown between
Republican Bush and Democratic Gore.
</P>
<P>
McCain has won seven states with 231 delegates, while Bush has
617 of the 1,034 delegates needed for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
McCain, who wants to push his political reform, quit the race
but did not shut down his campaign, keeping his options open.
</P>
<P>
He planned to take a week's vacation before determining what
leverage he has with Bush and what he might want to achieve with
it.
</P>
<P>
His aides said the tactic to suspend the campaign gives him
leverage against Bush as he urges the Republican nominee to adopt
his political reform agenda, especially the campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
Advisers have said McCain's options include barnstorming the
country to promote campaign finance reform, leading a platform
fight at the Republican National Convention and even running for
president as a third-party candidate.
</P>
<P>
His tactic to suspend his campaign may allow him to collect his
full allotment of federal campaign funds.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputy Urges for Excavating Imperial Mausoleum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Han Wei, who is here attending the Third Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC) as a deputy, said approval from
the central government is needed to launch the excavation project,
and the province is ready to set up a special research institution
in that regard which will be joined by the best archeologists and
experts on cultural relics preservation in the province.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 72 imperial tombs in Shaanxi Province,
including the mausoleum of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of Qin
Dynasty (AD 221-206 BC). All these imperial tombs were intact.
</P>
<P>
Most of these mausoleums were located in mountains made up of
limestone, which generates acid that calcifies the cultural relics
and makes them very brittle, according to the archeologist.
</P>
<P>
Han added that the successful excavation and restoration of the
mausoleum of Qin Shi Huang also indicated that Shaanxi is capable
of carrying out the project with its sophisticated techniques and
outstanding expertise in areas of tomb excavation, and
preservation and restoration of cultural relics.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Support "Grain-for-Trees" Plan (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The plan, known as "grain for trees and grass," marked a
fundamental change in the pattern of economic growth, which will
not only accelerate ecological recovery in China's western areas,
but also produce far-reaching impact on sustained economic growth
in this most populous nation, they said.
</P>
<P>
West China is the source of the Yangtze and the Yellow, China's
two longest rivers. In the past decades, excessive logging, land
reclamation and cattle herding resulted in serious soil erosion
and desertification.
</P>
<P>
Specialists held that worsening eco-environment was a major
factor contributing to ravaging floods in the Yangtze River Valley
and other rivers in China in 1998.
</P>
<P>
To prevent further deterioration of the eco-environment, China
kick-started an ambitious program to protect its natural forests.
In some areas farmers were encouraged to turn farmlands back to
forests and grassland.
</P>
<P>
But a weak economic basis and limited financial resources in
China's west threatened to hamper the initiative, because local
governments were unable to fully solve the problem of feeding and
clothing the farmers after they give up farming their land. It was
against this backdrop that the central authorities launched the "
grain-for-trees-and-grassland" plan.

<HEADLINE> Top Judge Briefs NPC Session on Court Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- "Chinese court dutifully
fulfilled its tasks enshrined by the Constitution and laws,
strengthened their trial work to help maintain social stability
and promote economic progress in 1999," China's top judge said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Xiang Yang, president of the Supreme People's Court, made the
remarks at the ongoing Third Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC), the country's top legislature, when
delivering the work report of the Supreme People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Supreme People's Court handled 5,768 cases of
second-instance, retrial and death penalty examination, among
which 5,544 were concluded.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, local courts across China in 1999 handled a
total of 5.692 million first-instance cases, 5.2 percent more than
in the previous year. Chinese courts concluded the trials of more
than 539,000 criminal cases, 12.27 percent more than the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
More than 600,000 people were given criminal penalties last
year, which represented an increase of 14.02 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Courts intensified crackdowns on crimes endangering the
market economic order, he said, noting that criminal penalties
were handed down to 22,657 people, and over 2.24 billion yuan of
direct economic losses were retrieved for the state last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, crimes of graft, bribery and misappropriation of
public funds were severely dealt with in accordance with law.
Courts across the country meted out sentences to 15,748 offenders.
Two officials at the ministerial level, 65 people holding posts at
the prefecture or department-level government and 367 people
holding posts at the county or division level received sentences
for their misconduct, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese courts have been working for the establishment of a
fair, clean, and highly-efficient operation system, Xiao said,
listing that the Supreme People's Court promulgated numerous
measures to reform trial methods strengthen internal checks and
balances, readjust the setup of collegiate bench and improve other
working mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
According to the top judge, to promote open trials, the Supreme
Court has ordered to open all trials of the first instance to the
public, except those defined by law as not appropriate for public
hearing, and no Chinese citizen should be refused to a court
hearing if he or she has a valid ID.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court has made separate divisions and personnel
responsible for different stages and aspects of a case, namely
filing case in file, trial, supervision and enforcement of the
court order. Xiao said this move would help ensure checks and
balances among judges and further promote the justice and
efficiency.

<HEADLINE> Top Judge Pledges to Have Court Orders Enforced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Courts across China enforced 2.
645 million verdicts as requested by litigants last year, which
involved a total of more than 249.7 billion yuan (30.1 billion US
dollars), top judge Xiao Yang said here today.
</P>
<P>
The number of cases and money involved in the past year
represented sharp increases of 27.3 percent and 57.72 percent
respectively over 1998, thanks to efforts to campaigns against
local interference in the enforcement of court verdicts, said Xiao
in his work report to the NPC plenary meeting. Because of economic
interests, local and departmental protectionism has long plagued
Chinese courts in the enforcement of court orders, and has
resulted in "law enforcement difficulties," now well-known among
legal professionals.
</P>
<P>
As a result, interests of related litigants have failed to be
protected by law, the authority of law has been violated, which
resulted in many serious social consequences, Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he added, the Supreme Court launched large-scale
campaigns for effective execution of long-delayed court verdicts
in addition to restructure of the country law enforcement system.
</P>
<P>
According to the new scheme, provincial higher people's courts
have been entitled to command law-enforcement departments and
equipment in the whole areas under their jurisdiction, which "
constitutes a major breakthrough in the restructuring of the
people's courts," Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
Media campaigns and other educational methods have been adopted
to persuade the related parties to pay their due compensations;
compulsory measures would be taken if they refused to listen; some
have been ordered to use their labor or other assets to pay debts.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the leadership of Party committees at various levels,
supervision of people's congresses and support from the government
bodies, a great number of long-delayed court verdicts have finally
been implemented last year, Xiao said.

<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China dismissed more than 540
unqualified court workers last year and meted out penalties to 1,
450 others who violated laws and discipline, top Chinese judge
Xiao Yang said here today.
</P>
<P>
Another 1,000 judges, who still could not qualify for their
posts, were transferred in 1999, said Xiao, president of the
Supreme People's Court, when delivering work report to the current
session of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
He told the nation's 3000 some lawmakers that court work in the
year 2000 will continue to focus on judicial corruption among a
small number of court workers and improve the professional levels
of the nation's judges.
</P>
<P>
The role of collegiate benches and independent judges shall be
strengthened, the current judge selection system shall be improved
so as to absorb more high-level legal professionals, and more
training programs be launched for better qualifications and
performances of judges, Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he pledged that in two years' time, judicial
corruption among the small number of judges should be effectively
curbed and outstanding public complaints among the masses of
people be substantively alleviated.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala: Belizean Military Movement on Border A Provocation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Guatemalan Defense Minister
General Juan de Dios Estrada warned Belize on Thursday that his
country considers as a provocation the constant movement of its
troops beginning this year near the Guatemalan border.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he has received reports that Belizean troops
have carried out maneuvers in the area bordering Guatemala since
the beginning of this year, which, at an international level,
should be considered a provocation.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Guatemala will maintain a peaceful stance and
not increase its military forces in that region.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring central American countries have suffered
tension due to a territorial dispute. On February 24, Guatemala
detained three Belizean soldiers and a policeman in the border
area. In protest, Belize canceled the February 25-26 bilateral
talks in Miami, the United States, on their land row.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala is claiming rights over about 12,000 square
kilometers, or one half of  Belize's current territory.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor
Yushchenko vowed on Thursday that Ukraine will try to become
sufficient in nuclear fuel to end its complete reliance on imports
from Russia.
</P>
<P>
At a government meeting on the development of the country's
nuclear energy, Yushchenko stressed the importance of nuclear
energy to the Ukrainian economy and urged government measures to
guarantee the development of nuclear fuel production line in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Ukraine is rich in uranium resources and equipped with the
technology of producing nuclear fuel," he said, "But up to now, it
has not established its own nuclear fuel production lines."
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko pointed out at
the meeting that establishing nuclear fuel enterprises is a
primary task for the former Soviet republic to develop nuclear
energy.
</P>
<P>
He said the government should increase investment in the energy
sector and reform the energy market in order to secure steady
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear power has made up more than 40 percent of Ukraine's
power supplies for years and Russia has been the country's main
supplier of nuclear fuel since the disintegration of the former
Soviet Union in 1991.

BUENOS AIRES, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Argentine government
Thursday alerted Brazil, its main Southern Common Market (Mercosur)
partner, that a possible subsidy war between the two countries
would possibly break out.
</P>

Argentine Minster of Economy Jose Luis Machinea said it is "

while the neighboring Argentine provinces threaten to do the same.
</P>
<P>
He said, "we will halt this or else we're headed for a subsidy
war with Brazil, as certain entrepreneur sectors propose, because
it is an absolutely wrong recipe for Mercosur members to declare a
subsidy war."
</P>
<P>
Before this situation, Mercosur must be strengthened, not
weakened, he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that in order to resolve the conflict, trading
restrictions and subsidies to exports within the block must be
eliminated.

CARACAS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela will continue to
prohibit Colombia's trucks from entering the Venezuelan territory,
an official source said Thursday.

The Venezuelan government adopted this measure in May 1999 to

In 1998, trade between Venezuela and Colombia reached 2.5

among the Andean countries. But the bilateral trade fell to 1.76
billion dollars last year due to the transport problems and the

<HEADLINE> Anhui Kicks Off Water Supply, Sanitation Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province has
kicked off a rural water supply and sanitation project in a bid to
improve farmers' living conditions.
</P>
<P>
The project involves a total investment of 28 million US
dollars, half of which will be in loan from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the province has made significant gains in
water supply to rural areas, ranging from basic water source
protection to piped water supply to households.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the progress, local farmers continue to draw
water from unsafe sources or endure insufficient supplies,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The project calls for the construction of 149 waterworks in
eight counties including Lujiang, Wuwei and Wuhe, which will
benefit 1.13 million people, and also the building of more than 2,
000 public toilets.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Stefan Lindemann of Germany won the
men's title at the World Junior Figure Skating Championships in
Oberstdorf Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lindemann had only the second-best free skate but his first in
qualifying and second in the short were good enough to give him
the overall victory.
</P>
<P>
Second was France's Vincent Restencourt, who actually won the
free skating portion but was only in fourth entering the final
part.
</P>
<P>
American Matt Savoie, who led after the short but had several
mistakes in his routine, came to the third.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Ilya Klimkin of Russia was fourth with an
erratic routine. He had a quadruple salchow-triple toe loop
combination but fell four times.
</P>
<P>
Lindemann's victory was the first time a skater outside of the
United States or Russia captured the men's title since 1993 when
Yevgeny Pliuta won for Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The ice dance was led by Russia's Natasha Romaniuta and Danil
Barantsev led after the original dance. American couples Emilie
Nussear and Brandon Forsyth and Tanhith Belbin and Benjamin Agosto
followed with the free dance on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Request Promised Aid in the Coming Arab Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon is expected to request more
aid from Arab countries at the forthcoming Arab Foreign Ministers'
Conference to be held in Beirut on Saturday and Sunday, local media
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League's assistant secretary-general Ahmed Bin Helli
said in a statement in Cairo Thursday that the Beirut conference
would take financial and political measures of support for Lebanon,
the report quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait had so
far extended aid to Lebanon for its post-civil war reconstruction
drive. "We shall table a draft resolution at the conference to
coordinate collective Arab efforts in this field," he added.
</P>
<P>
Some media saw the remarks as a signal of the Arab resolve to
extend regular financial assistance to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
An Nahar newspaper reported Friday that Syria, Lebanon's main
power broker, had tabled on the conference's agenda a draft
resolution that calls on AL member states to offer Lebanon 2
billion U.S. dollars pledged by previous Arab summits.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that only 425 million dollars have been extended
so far.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution also proposed that the 2 billion dollars be
paid over four years and an immediate assistance of 500 million
dollars be offered to help Lebanon in reconstruction after recent
Israeli attacks on its civilian infrastructure, including the
February 8 air blitz that destroyed three major power relay
stations.
</P>
<P>
A similar Arab foreign ministerial session held in the Syrian
capital of Damascus in 1993 had promised 500 million dollars to
relieve Lebanon's economic havoc caused by a three-week Israeli
artillery offensive in July that year.
</P>
<P>
But the war-wrecked country only got slightly more than 100
million dollars, An Nahar reported.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has already offered 100 million dollars in soft
loans and a donation of 30 million dollars to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Kuwait signed an agreement with Lebanon to grant 8.
5 million dollars to Lebanon for its rehabilitation of the damaged
power stations.
</P>
<P>
The AL decided to hold its 113th foreign ministerial meeting in
Beirut instead of the bloc's headquarter in the Egyptian city of
Cairo to show Arab solidarity and the organization's support to
Lebanon against the February 8 Israeli attacks.

<HEADLINE> Things on Cyprus Moving in Right Direction: U.S. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- United States Presidential
Emissary for Cyprus Alfred Moses on Friday expressed hopefullness
that there will be some movement toward a solution on Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after three days of talks on the
island, Moses said things are "moving in the right direction."
However, he refrained from making further disclosure.
</P>
<P>
He said he discussed "some new ideas" with the Greek and Turkish
Cypriot sides, which took into account their concerns and would
hopefully help them bridge their differences.
</P>
<P>
"I did discuss some new ideas, we are still in the early stages,
to expose them to the sun would kill them," Moses told the press.
</P>
<P>
He said he was encouraged by the "commitment of both sides" to
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have to have the two parties engaging intensely on the
issues that divided them to see if we can move toward a
comprehensive settlement later this year," Moses said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island after a
failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
United Nations-sponsored indirect talks were held in New York on
December 3-14, 1999 and in Geneva from January 31 to February 8, to
pave the way for direct talks aimed at a solution to the Cyprus
issue. The indirect talks are due to resume in New York, where the
U.N. headquarters is seated, on May 23.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the economic disparity between the northern
Turkish Cypriot area and southern Greek Cypriot area, Moses said
this is a "manifestation of the division of the island" and should
this division disappear and the island re-unified, the problem will
disappear too.

WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. federal regulators on
Friday conditionally approved the 50-billion-U.S.-dollar merger of
Qwest Communications Inc. and regional Bell company U S West Inc.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) gave conditional
approval on a 5-0 vote. Qwest will have to divest itself of its
customers in the U S West territory of 14 Western states.
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes after Deutsche Telekom AG abruptly ended
talks to acquire the two Denver-based telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
The FCC said Qwest must give up about 6 percent of its long-
distance customers, all of whom live in areas served by U S West.
Commissioners said they want full details of Qwest's plans to turn
over those customers to another company before they finally
approve the merger.
</P>
<P>
"Qwest's divestiture and the commission's approval must be
completed prior to closing the merger," the FCC said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, some states are reviewing the merger for approval.

<HEADLINE> Canada Maintains Lowest Jobless Rates in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada maintained a jobless rate
of 6.8 percent in February, the fourth consecutive month for
lowest unemployment in the past 24 years, Statistics Canada
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The first month of the year also saw a 6.8 percent rate for
unemployment, which was last set in April 1976.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 40,000 full-time jobs were created to bring the
total positions generated this year to about 80,000, as a result
of sustained strength in the economy.
</P>
<P>
There was, however, a similar increase in the number of job
seekers to offset the jobless rate in February.
</P>
<P>
Alberta and Saskatchewan in western Canada each recorded a
jobless rate below 5 percent last month, with Alberta, in
particular, seeing 10,000 new jobs to put unemployment down to 4.9
percent, the lowest since December 1981.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate could drop below 6 percent this year,
while economic growth may exceed 4 percent in the first quarter of
2000, according to Canadian economists.

<HEADLINE> British Airways Boss Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Bob Ayling, chief executive of
British Airways, resigned on Friday after four years in charge.
</P>
<P>
He said he planned to take a break with his family before
considering future career options.
</P>
<P>
The resignation surprised the City, although many analysts have
been calling for a new boss with fresh ideas to turn round the
airline's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
BA's chairman Lord Marshall will take over until a successor is
found.
</P>
<P>
BA shares initially surged on the news, as investors
disappointed with the airline's financial performance over the
past year breathed a sigh of relief. But the stock then eased as
the market wondered how long it will take to choose Ayling's
successor. The shares closed 2.1 percent up at 299-1/4 pence.
</P>
<P>
Ayling, 54, said the past four years had taken their toll and
that he would take a break with his family before considering
future career options.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, BA has been hit by rising fuel costs, price
cutting on the North Atlantic route and a growing challenge from
low cost airlines in Europe.
</P>
<P>
BA last month reported a third quarter operating loss of two
million pounds (3.16 million U.S. dollars), compared to a 92
million pound profit a year earlier. For the full year, analysts
expect BA to post a loss of around 250 million pounds.

<HEADLINE> OAS Satisfied With Juridical Principles in Pinochet's Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Organization of American States
(OAS) General Secretary Cesar Gaviria expressed Friday his
satisfaction with respect to the juridical principles in the case
of Chilean lifetime Senator Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Gaviria made this statement at his arrival at the international
airport of this city to attend Saturday the ceremony of changing
the presidential mandate in this country between Eduardo Frei and
Ricardo Lagos.
</P>
<P>
The OAS general secretary said that with the return of the
former Chilean ruler to the country, the juridical principles the
OAS had defended have been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
He said that Pinochet's return demonstrates that the juridical
principles defended by the Chilean government and supported by his
organization have been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet appointed Lawyer Ambrosio Rodriguea as his
representative in the cause he is subjected to, which is
investigated by Judge Juan Guzman, said Rodriguez himself.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said Thursday that the retired general signed the
documents that give him power of attorney to assume his defense,
so he will face the allegations before the Santiago Court of
Appeals to strip him of his congressional privileges.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Lagos's assumption as president of Chile, Gaviria
said, "Americans have big hopes because Chile has progressed to be
a country with a strong democracy, but also a nation that has
advanced a lot in social affairs ."
</P>
<P>
Inter-American Development Bank President Enrique Iglesias, who
also arrived Friday morning in Chile, said that there is a great
expectation at a world level about what Lagos's performance as
president will be at the Presidential Palace of La Moneda.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sends Envoys to Kosovo to Avoid "Hot Spring" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at a regular briefing at the State Department, Rubin
said he expected to meet U.N. officials, U.S. military officials,
Kosovo Albanian leaders Ibrahim Rugova, Hashim Thaqi and Rexhep
Qosja and Serbian Orthodox Bishop Artemije.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary has asked me to ... assess the situation
throughout the province and to urge the Kosovo Albanians to play a
more constructive role," he added.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day trip, Rubin said he would "express our
profound concern about extremist activity on all sides" in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Rubin's assignment last year began quietly in France, where
negotiations in Rambouillet to end the conflict in Kosovo were
faltering. His main task in the Serbian province was to cultivate
Hashim Thaci, political leader of the Kosovo rebels.
</P>
<P>
The tensions between Serbs and ethnic Albanians are on the rise
in Kosovo recently. In Brussels, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright discussed with European officials how to avoid
a "hot spring" -- the explosion of new violence.
</P>
<P>
"The spring has not always been good in the Balkans," Albright
said. "We have been consulting on ways to try to lower the
temperature and press extremists not to pursue activities that
complicate the situation."
</P>
<P>
Last spring, the conflict between the Serbs and Albanians in
Kosovo led to the 78-day air bombing of Yugoslavia by the U.S.-led
NATO.

<HEADLINE> Vancouver Goes High-Tech for Beer Bars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Vancouver is one of the three
cities in the world to have e-bars for beer drinkers, the Globe
and Mail newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Beer.com, a Web site owned by Belgium's Interbrew SA, is
offering a completely new way to say "Can I buy you a drink?" by
linking the Internet with Web cameras located in bars in Vancouver,
New York and Brussels.
</P>
<P>
If a Web surfer wants to buy someone a Stella Artois, they can
place the order on-line using their credit card.
</P>
<P>
The Stella Cam, which "personifies beer.com's attitude of
having fun on the Internet," lets people surfing the Web visit
bars "meet" people sitting on designated seats.
</P>
<P>
Rocco Rossi, beer.com's president, was quoted as saying that
the Stella Cam is an innovative way to meet new people around the
world -- even if it is just a virtual interaction.
</P>
<P>
The cost of a Stella Artois on-line is 10 Canadian dollars (
about 6.87 U.S. dollars), nearly double what it would cost to
purchase a bottle of the blond pilsener at a Canadian bar, the
newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Receives Food Aid for One Month Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has received food aid
from all over the world sufficient for one month consumption of
the flood displaced people living in temporary accommodation
centers, the National Disasters Management Institute (INGC) said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Silvano Langa, director of the institute, said that 2,000 tons
of food aid was now available, which could feed around 430,000
people for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
He said the food was distributing about 100 tons a day through
airlift and road, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The problem of food is not a problem of availability", Langa
added. "It has to do with how the centers are organized."
</P>
<P>
Langa said the institute was short of tents for the
accommodation. " over the last three days Maputo city alone
requested a further 150 tents, but we don't have that many", he
said.

<HEADLINE> Canada Criticizes U.S. Reluctance to Help End Congo Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Canadian Secretary
of State for Africa David Kilgour criticized on Friday the United
States for not doing enough to help bring an end to the conflict
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The Canadian official said Washington was not prepared to
commit " resources or the people to a robust mission as
peacekeeper or even peacemaker in the DRC."
</P>
<P>
Kilgour told members of the South African parliament's foreign
affairs committee that the international community need to
strengthen its political will to help end the DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
Kilgour said Canada backs the UN resolution to expand the UN
 Organization Mission in the Congo (MONUC) by 5,300 people, with
5,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
However, Canada believed the mission's mandate was not wide
enough and doubted phase three of its program -- the deployment of
a robust peacekeeping force to safeguard the ceasefire in the DRC
-- would take place.
</P>
<P>
He said the dangerous and costly mission would not be launched
for the lack of a political will.
</P>
<P>
He urged South Africa to push for greater commitment from the
international community.
</P>
<P>
"You can push very hard for phase three to go ahead, which
some people doubt will take place," said Kilgour, who is heading
a 16-strong Canadian delegation on an extended
information-gathering mission to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We need a strong peace enforcement mission capable of
disarming the rebel factions in the DRC," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Press Applauds Clinton's Trade Bill With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The New York Times and The
Journal of Commerce, two well-known newspapers in the United
States, published editorials respectively Friday, rendering strong
support for President Bill Clinton in his bid to win an early
congressional approval of permanent trading status with China.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress should "quickly approve legislation needed to
smooth China's admission to the World Trade Organization" (WTO)
and grant the country normal trading status "on a permanent basis,
" The New York Times' editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, entitled "A Good Deal With China," criticized
some Congressmen for having used the annual debates over China's
trade privileges to challenge Beijing's human rights record and
other offensive behavior in the past years.
</P>
<P>
"Linking these issues to trade made no obvious sense and
produced scant results," said the editorial, which came out just
after President Clinton sent to Congress Wednesday a piece of
legislation pleading for Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR)
with China.
</P>
<P>
"What President Clinton seeks from Congress is a change in
China's trade status under American law," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
It said that Senate approval of the needed changes in trade law
"seems likely," but the outlook in the House is "less promising,"
where "at least 20 more Democratic votes are needed."
</P>
<P>
But the editorial said neither the Taiwan issue nor labor's
misplaced opposition should hold up an early, positive vote, since
"the China trade bill serves broad American interests and deserves
strong bipartisan support."
</P>
<P>
The Journal of Commerce echoed the comment, describing in its
own editorial President Clinton's proposed legislation as "a
powerful case" which the Capitol Hill should heed attentively.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, entitled "Pass the China Bill," warned that
Congressional short-sightedness on the WTO and PNTR issue will
cost the United States an economic opportunity provided by an
agreement reached between Washington and Beijing last November,
under which China pledged to open its market to U.S. goods and
investments.
</P>
<P>
"China's accession to the WTO isn't up to Congress," the
editorial said. "If Congress fails to grant China permanent NTR
status, it won't stop China from becoming a member of the WTO.
What it will do is stop the United States from benefiting from
China's (WTO) membership.
</P>
<P>
"China won't be obligated to open its market to the United
States even as it opens up to other countries in the WTO. And that
will hurt the United States -- whose own market is already largely
open -- far more than it will hurt China," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
It advised Congress to "listen" to the president and "move
swiftly" to approve China PNTR so that the United States may
continue its trade with China and gain benefits from the process.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed After Big Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Friday after Thursday's big rally which pushed the technology
heavy Nasdaq composite above 5,000 and lifted the Dow industrials
back to the 10,000 mark.
</P>
<P>
At the close of the trading, the Nasdaq rose 1.76 at 5,048.62,
surpassing the record closing high of 5,046.86 points Thursday. In
the previous session, the composite closed above the 5,000 mark
for the first time, only 46 trading sessions after crossing 4,000.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Dow industrial
average fell 81.91 at 9,928.82 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
fell 6.62 at 1,395.07.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq rose as investors continued their favor with
technology stocks. The index scored a moderate rise at the close
session after fluctuation between gains and losses because some
investors took profits on the big gains of the index Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But the Dow suffered from a profit warning. Consumer products
company Dial Corp. said its earnings for the first half of this
year will be down at least 10 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Procter &AMP; Gamble, another consumer products maker,
warned that its current quarter earnings would miss its own
estimates and expectations by Wall Street analysts. The warning
dragged the Dow index 374.47 points lower.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 3.66 at 599.34 and the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies fell 2.31 at 603.81. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 14.58 at 1.033.33.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-8 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,714 down, 1,254 up and 518
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 1.13 billion shares from 1.12 billion
in the previous session, according to preliminary calculation.

s Deposits Guarantee Agency for banks vigilance and to expand from
one to three years the term for the capitalization of the
financial institutions that are in difficulties.
</P>

Franks said that the reforms requested by the IMF will give
strength to the Economic Transportation Law promulgated by the
presidency and that it foresees the eventual adoption of the
dollar as the Ecuadorian currency, instead of the sucre.

The IMF has foreseen disbursements for 300 million dollars for

<P>
MANAGUA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The agriculture ministers of
Central America, Mexico, Panama, the Dominican Republic and Belize,
criticized Friday the subsidies the developed countries grant to
their producers, which damage the productive sectors of the
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture ministers that make up the Regional Agriculture
Cooperation  Council (CORECA) concluded Friday the 19th ordinary
meeting of that regional agency in which they discussed the
development of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed during their two-day meeting the use of
transgenic products or genetically improved seeds in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica and Mexico, both members of the CORECA, have already
started to apply genetic engineering to some of their cultivations,
and are promoting its application in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Mexico is cultivating transgenic crops, such as cotton and
tomatoes, on some 100,000 hectares. Costa Rica cultivated 174
hectares for the production of transgenic seeds, especially of
cotton and in a lesser measure soy beans and corn.
</P>
<P>
The CORECA, founded in 1981, has as its purpose to search for
solutions to the problems of the agricultural and livestock
sectors of its member countries.
