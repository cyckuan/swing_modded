   Have you noticed that it's getting more crowded around here?
</P>
<P>
   Mini-mart gas stations and fast-food restaurants on every
corner. Malls popping up like mushrooms. Housing developments
gobbling up open spaces. And traffic, lots of traffic. Even the
carpool lanes are developing arterial sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   But we haven't become LA _ not yet, anyway. And that is part of
the allure. The sky is still clear, for the most part, the sunsets
are heavenly and snow shovels aren't a big seller.
</P>
<P>
   People from around the country and the world have discovered
what once was native Arizonans' secret: It's a great place to live.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the record, athletes are people, too.
</P>
<P>
   From the Diamondbacks' Randy Johnson and Matt Williams to golfer
Tom Lehman and dozens of other top-flight athletes, the Arizona
lifestyle, and Arizona's pro sports opportunities, have proved an
irresistible combination.
</P>
<P>
   Jyrki Lumme left Vancouver. The Suns' Rex Chapman and Danny
Manning migrated. Heck, even Mike Tyson wants to live here.
</P>
<P>
   That's a trend _ one that should keep Arizona's sports teams
competitive in all fields.
</P>
<P>
   What has led to this major league immigration of talent?
</P>
<P>
   It's different from sport to sport, and from player to player. A
competitive organization, a charismatic owner _ and, of course, top
money _ can be integral to attracting athletes as well. The
Republic's Sunday Special report looks at some of the factors that
have led the state to become a sports magnet.

LOVE THAT GREEN: MONEY, GRASS  
 CARDINALS ARE DRAWN TO PLAYING SURFACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic

<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Bob Ferguson would rather have great weather than
not have it, although he acknowledges an undying love for Buffalo,
N.Y., where he once worked.
</P>
<P>
   He figures that most free-agent pro football players he tries to
hire see it the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else being equal, the Valley's mild autumn and winter
weather offers one advantage: Grass. Green grass. Green, soft grass
that doesn't cause pounding on sensitive joints or create
three-inch carpet burns that take a month to heal.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals practice on, and play home games on, the real
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been used here over the years,'' said Ferguson, the
Cardinals vice president for player personnel. ``The climate is
more a factor in football than in a lot of other sports in this
city. No. 1 is, we play on grass. That's something guys think about
even if it's in Cleveland. It's more important in free agency in
our business than others.''
</P>
<P>
   The climate, which encourages those pristine playing fields, can
be a deal-closer but not a deal-maker, according to Ferguson. In
the NFL, and other professional sports, the bottom line for a
free-agent isn't the opportunity to get in a round of golf in
February in a light sweater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe money dictates all of it. No question,''
Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley is off-season home to many NFL players, but not all
of them are beating a path to the Cardinals. For example, safety
Mark Carrier, a Scottsdale resident, took a look at Arizona but
signed with Detroit because he got a better contract offer.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin concurs with Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most decisions are determined by the contract offer,'' Tobin
said. ``But when you get into intangibles, if a player has two or
three offers that are similar, it might make the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've heard players tell me playing on grass is important
to them, then they sign where you can't practice outside and where
you play on turf because they got more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said he was happy to see the Diamondbacks sign pitcher
Randy Johnson to a whopping free-agent contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited to see them get Randy,'' Ferguson said. ``I love
that kind of thing. I'd love to see the Diamondbacks succeed.
Success helps all the teams in the Valley. It attracts attention
for all of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``For baseball players, this city is an attractive place to
live. There are so many training camps in Arizona. Now they have a
beautiful stadium. Those things are important. When we have our
stadium, we'll have more to offer, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, I sell us, and the program, and the organization more
than the weather,'' Ferguson said. ``Players make those decisions
on their own. You don't want to oversell.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Eric Swann, for example, wanted to stay with
the club when he became a free agent last winter not only because
he saw a young defense with the potential to dominate. He also
wanted to play on natural grass because of his arthritic knees.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Chris Gedney said the climate was a factor in his
signing with the Cardinals after his contract in Chicago expired
two seasons ago. He moved his family to the Valley year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of the Cardinals still live elsewhere in the
off-season, but many NFL players live here, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the weather was a bonus but not the determining
factor, Gedney said. ``Obviously it is easier on your body to play
on grass in warm weather. That alone isn't enough to put it over
the top. I know a lot of players who live here, have houses here,
who play for other teams would like to stay here to play, too.''
</P>
<P>
   If the club gets its new stadium _ voters in May will help
determine that _ Ferguson said that will give the club additional
sources of revenue to make better offers. &QL;

FOR MANY SUNS, IT'S CO LANGELO  
 FIRST-CLASS OPERA TION ATTRACTS NBA PLAY ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Look around on the Valley's golf courses, and you're
likely to see any number of former or current NBA players,
especially in the winter of the NBA lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Former Suns such as Charles Barkley, Dan Majerle and Joe Kleine
make their homes here. So does former NBA great Bob Lanier, who now
works for the league. Former NBA Coach Dick Motta resides here, as
do current Suns, such as Danny Manning.
</P>
<P>
   But is it the Valley's warm weather, it's golf courses and low
taxes that attract athletes?
</P>
<P>
   Suns Coach Danny Ainge, who has been recruited and done the
recruiting, said those factors may be the reasons players decide to
make their permanent homes here, but it isn't why they come here to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge was signed by the Suns as a free agent in 1992 and played
three seasons in the Valley. He made his home in Gilbert and
remained there after his playing career ended while he worked as an
analyst for Turner Sports.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as a coach, Ainge is on the other end, trying to convince
free-agent players that this is the place to live and play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this sounds corny, but I came to Phoenix because I felt
like they had a good team, I felt they needed me and wanted me at
the time,'' Ainge said. ``Every athlete wants to be wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you want me to say it was the golf courses and the warm
weather and all that, but if Phoenix wasn't a good basketball
organization and didn't have a good team, none of that would have
meant anything. Ultimately, what got me here was Jerry Colangelo.''
</P>
<P>
   Players have cited the America West Arena facility, which
includes an on-site practice gym, top-of-the-line weight room,
saunas and a giant Jacuzzi whirlpool. The Valley's lifestyle also
is attractive because of the warm winters.
</P>
<P>
   But Ainge said it takes more. He said recent signings by the
Arizona Diamondbacks, which also are under Colangelo's umbrella,
prove that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of this (NBA) lockout, I've had an opportunity to talk
to Todd Stottlemyre and Steve Finley, and both of those guys told
me one of the main reasons they were coming here was Jerry
Colangelo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry's a powerful man, yet he's approachable and he wants to
win. That comes across in his conversations, and you have
confidence that he knows what he's doing. You can see in his eyes
and hear in his voice that he's going to do everything he can to
have a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had other opportunities to coach before Phoenix, and I went
in to talk with Jerry about this job knowing what he was going to
ask and thinking I wasn't going to do it. I had a great job at TNT,
a great lifestyle. He convinced me this was the time, and this was
the place. He has a passion for what he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, guys coming here to retire is a whole different scenario.
That's where the weather and golf courses are a factor. But I'll
maintain that players go where they think they'll have success,
where they feel wanted and where they'll be treated like
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not all about sun and golf. Los Angeles is very similar
in that way. There's plenty of great weather and golf courses, but
I don't see anybody dying to go play for the Clippers.''

FAMILY COMES FIRST  
 DOLLARS, FACILITIES ALSO IMPORTANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - One could almost feel the parched throat of Randy
Johnson, the Diamondbacks' tall drink of water, as he talked about
playing for the team and residing in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can make it through the summers here,'' he said, followed
by a pause, ``I'll probably live here the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Seattle Mariners for the bulk of his career,
Johnson hasn't had the opportunity to bake here. But $52.4 million
will buy a lot of thirst quenchers. Pitching in air-conditioned,
retractable-roof Bank One Ballpark also should help.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is family. That is one of the reasons why Johnson
moved here in 1996, long before he became a Diamondback. It is a
good place for families, he said, and when his wife and kids are
happy, he is, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look in the stands and see family, it motivates me,
makes me dig down a little bit deeper,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   It impressed him, Johnson said, to learn that third baseman Matt
Williams would ask to leave a World Series team in Cleveland to be
with his children in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   It would be naive to think that it's just about the living
conditions. In the case of the Diamondbacks and Suns, both operated
by Jerry Colangelo, it's about the working conditions and how much
the team is willing to pay the players to work in those conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound like we're patting ourselves on our
backs, but I think a lot of our success and the reason that people
want to play here is that we treat athletes the way they want to be
treated and not like a pound of flesh,'' Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   The tide began to turn, he said, when the Suns moved from
Veterans Memorial Coliseum to America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the practice court there, the locker area, all the
amenities. . . . We created something that is self-perpetuating,''
Colangelo said. ``We wanted the plan to be the same for the
ballpark, and that's what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams moved here in 1987 while playing for the San Francisco
Giants and their Triple-A affiliate, the Phoenix Firebirds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do anything at any time of year here,'' he said. ``You
really can't beat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other major-leaguers live here, as well as many
Firebirds alumni. Diamondback-turned-Dodger Devon White, Tony
Phillips, Terry Mulholland, Jeff Fassero, Mike Fetters, Bill Swift,
Cal Eldred and former major-leaguers such as Ryne Sandberg share
our freeways.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time that Williams moved here, catcher Kirt
Manwaring, his buddy with the Giants and Firebirds, made the move
from Horseheads, in west-central New York state. Williams and
Manwaring, a free agent who likely will return to the Colorado
Rockies next season, have the same agent. They still live near each
other in Scottsdale and hang out together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have moved to the Bay area, but it was hard not to
want to live here,'' Manwaring said. ``The cost of living is a
little better and it's a great place for families. You can do so
much.'' Eldred, the Milwaukee Brewers right-hander, moved from Iowa
to Chandler in 1995, near what was then the team's spring-training
site, to work on rehabilitating his injured elbow. He and his
family remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're Christians. Our faith is very important to us, and we
found a Christian fellowship here that is fantastic,'' Eldred said.
``The family atmosphere and the weather are important. Being away
from the kids most of the summer is difficult, but the weather is
so good here that the winter is like a second summer to us, going
out and doing all sorts of activities.''

A FRANCHISE ON THE RISE  
 FOR COYOTES, BIG DRAW IS SHOT AT CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   PHOENIX - Hockey players, by nature, seem to be excellent
golfers. They say it might have something to do with the
similarities of the swing of a driver to the slam of a slap shot.
</P>
<P>
   But golf, and the abundance of quality golf resorts in the
Valley, really has nothing to do with wooing potential National
Hockey League free agents to Phoenix to play for the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even have time for golf,'' said defenseman Jyrki
Lumme, one of the most coveted unrestricted free agents in the
league last summer, who chose to sign with the Coyotes over a
half-dozen other clubs. ``During the season, you don't really have
enough time to play, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in the summer, when I do have time, I'll probably go back
to Finland like I always do, or maybe go spend some time in
Vancouver.''
</P>
<P>
   Lumme, who played in Vancouver for the past nine seasons, had
never played for a team in the United States before. His first two
seasons in the NHL were spent in Montreal. He hemmed and hawed
about leaving Canada, but like many Coyotes players interviewed, he
said his first and foremost reason for coming to Phoenix was
because he felt the franchise was on the rise and capable of
challenging for the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up and down their roster and I really liked what I
saw,'' Lumme said. ``That was the biggest thing for me. I felt by
coming here, I had a real chance to win. Everything else, like the
weather, the good facilities, the quality of life, that was nice.
But it was kind of secondary.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto with veteran power forward Rick Tocchet, who won a Stanley
Cup in Pittsburgh and could have signed with just about any team
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, one of the factors actually ``was'' the weather,''
said Tocchet, who has said the cold and snow he encountered while
playing back East made his battle with minor back problems tougher.
``But I liked the way the roster looked, too. They had some good
young players here, some quality veterans, and a team that wants to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Lumme and Tocchet, and others, offered various reasons why
playing in the Valley has its advantages over other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The affordability,'' said center Jeremy Roenick, who didn't
really have a choice in coming to the Valley. He was traded to the
Coyotes two seasons ago by the Chicago Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying houses or buying land is excellent in Arizona. It's a
great place, financially, to live. You've still got your taxes, but
it's nothing like you pay in other places, like Canada, for
instance.''
</P>
<P>
   Lumme said hockey players don't live in a fishbowl here like
they do in the Great White North. That, to him, was also a plus,
especially after the disappointing season the Canucks had a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be a little healthier atmosphere in Phoenix,'' Lumme
said. ``The stuff I had to go through last year . . . every day it
was people in my face asking questions. I don't need that. The
pressure is still there. That never goes away. But now, when I go
to the grocery store, you don't have everyone asking you what is
going on if you lost one or two games.''
</P>
<P>
   Roenick and Tocchet said they plan to make Phoenix their
permanent homes, regardless of where their hockey careers take
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've consolidated, man. I moved everything here. I'm a Phoenix
guy now,'' Tocchet said. ``I've got no more properties back in
Pennsylvania like I used to have. I just really love it here.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the golf . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' said Roenick, who sports a 1 handicap, ``it doesn't
hurt.'' &QL;

<P>
   PHOENIX -For Hale Irwin, Arizona was not his first choice when
he decided to relocate from his longtime residence near St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, my wife (Sally) and I bought a piece of property in
Florida six years ago, but we never really knew what to do with
it,'' said the Senior PGA Tour star of the lot he bought in North
Palm Beach. ``Jack and Barb (Nicklaus) kept telling us that we
needed to live by the water, and so we just kept sitting on it (the
lot) trying to decide what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I said to Sally, we need to go out and look at
Phoenix one more time before we sink that much money into (a new
lot by the water). We took a trip to Arizona and really liked the
desert. The climate and the golf courses, plus future
considerations with my golf course business, just kind of dictated
us moving here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sally Irwin said there were a few other considerations to the
Irwins' move to Paradise Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Louis always gets a little chilly. Actually it's downright
cold this time of year,'' she said. ``And Hale needed a place
conducive to practice in the winter, and we'd always loved the
West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona and Florida have a similar climate, but it's less
windy in Arizona and it rains a lot more in Florida. Once our house
is done, everything will be perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Raising Arizona to the top of their list obviously works for
other pros, too. More than 40 LPGA players, five other seniors and
19 PGA Tour players called Arizona home during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Of those three tours, the PGA Tour might be the most
representative when it comes to the preference of professional
golfers. Only Florida (64 PGA Tour players), California (29) and
Texas (29) are called home by more pros than Arizona. And Florida
and Texas have a special allure _ no state income tax.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Calcavecchia is well aware of the Arizona-Florida debate
that faces many professional athletes. He owns a home in Ahwatukee,
but also keeps a second home in West Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's mainly a tax thing,'' said Calcavecchia, who
claims residency in Florida even though he spends most of his time
in his 90-door mansion nestled into the foothills of South
Mountain. ``I mean, there has to be a reason why Tiger and all of
those guys are living in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing I can come up with is the weather advantages.
Florida is just not as consistently nice as Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there's another reason Calcavecchia enjoys Arizona,
said his wife, Sheryl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really the one that loves Arizona, having grown up here in
the Valley and still having all of my family here,'' she said.
``But Mark has come to love it, too, now that we've got all the
professional sports covered and he can go to the games when he's
not playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, he's got some pretty good memories, having won the
Phoenix Open twice.''
</P>
<P>
   For Tom and Melissa Lehman, the choice was easy. Minnesota or
Arizona? OK, next question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great weather, a great city, great people, and it's
convenient for both of us with our parents and family,'' the
Scottsdale pro said. ``It's a nice big city, yet it has a little
bit of a small-city feel to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golf is great, and it's got a great airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Gee, the Chamber of Commerce could not have said it better. &QL;

better win than the 71-48 decision over Southwestern Louisiana at
Rutgers, ASU Coach Charli Turner Thorne said. And on paper St.
Joseph's is not as good as Rutgers although the Hawks beat the
Scarlet Knights, 67-54, last season.
</P>
<P>
   That adds up to a chance for the Sun Devils to capture their
holiday tournament for the first time since 1994, but only if they
can put a complete game together at Wells Fargo Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what it takes,'' said freshman forward Leah Combs, in
double-figure rebounds (12) for the fourth time of her brief
college career. ``We need to put the whole thing together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be ready,'' Turner Thorne said. ``If we do what we do
well, we'll be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Even coming off consecutive losses to Rutgers (67-48) and Texas
(77-75), ASU needed something of a wake-up call halfway through the
first half. Gonzaga (1-5) used an 8-1 run to pull within 21-16 at
9:07 and force an ASU timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ASU scored the next 10 points, four of those by backup forward
Aubrey McFadyen in what was her best game of the season, then
buried the Bulldogs, 52-27, by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's way too late (to break away),'' Combs said. ``We can't
come out slow.''
</P>
<P>
   Four Sun Devils reached double-figure scoring, including point
guard Natalie Tucker with a team-high 17, but the game was most
significant for the return of Ebony Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the first game of the Wells Fargo Classic last year
that Edwards, the two-time Arizona Player of the Year from Chandler
High School, blew out her right knee. Her return this season was
delayed because of arthroscopic surgery, her third such procedure
on the same knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about that (timing coincidence) the other day,''
Edwards said. ``I'm not worried about my knee. I just have to take
it little by little, and I have to make sure my legs are warmed up
before the game. I'm just looking forward to getting through a full
season. I can help the team out. My talent hasn't been seen yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards played three minutes per half against Gonzaga and hit a
pair of second-half jumpers. She also flashed the intense defense
that makes her a valuable addition to a guard lineup, which with
the uncertain availability of Georgie Lang, was at least one player
short.
</P>
<P>
   Three of those guards _ Tucker, Kitch Kitchen and Shelly Tom _
combined for 41 points as ASU shot 53.2 percent.

PLAYERS DENY TIFFS WITH STARS' COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, we told you things weren't looking so rosy down in
Dallas, where sources said the Stars were in danger of possibly
blowing up because of some apparent backbiting over their coach,
 &UR; Ken
 &UR; Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Dallas players responded by saying there are no
problems whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really hard to believe,'' Stars defenseman  &UR; Shawn
Chambers told ``The Dallas Morning News.'' ``To me, it's
humorous,'' ``Guys talk all the time, saying things like, `Hitch is
on a rampage.' But the next day, everything is fine. That's part of
the little stuff, and it happens all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman  &UR; Richard Matvichuk said the team has no beef with
Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect Hitch for what he's done for this team,'' he said.
``He's brought us to where we are, from not making the playoffs a
few years ago, to winning the President's Trophy last year.
Somebody's just trying to stir the pot. From the players to the
coaching staff, we've got a pretty good relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman  &UR; Darryl Sydor said, ``I think someone's fishing for
something, trying to get something stirred up here. Maybe it's the
playoffs starting a little early.'' &QL; 
Warning, Mr. Robinson &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They say things are dandy in Dallas, but it's definitely lousy
in Los Angeles, where the Kings have stumbled to 10 losses in an
11-game stretch and have scored just once in the first period in
their past nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Larry Robinson erupted after a recent loss, questioning
his players' hearts for their refusal to play in front of the net
and pay the price with gutsy efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can tell them to go there, and we can show them what they
can do,'' Robinson said, ``but we're not allowed to jump on the ice
and grab them by the scruff of the neck and place them in front of
the net and say, `Hey, you've got to be here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said the problem has nothing to do with personnel. It's
desire. His players aren't showing any, and he's fed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can't produce, it's going to up at the point where
(General Manager) Dave (Taylor) is going to come to me and say,
`Hey, you know, either you get these guys going or we'll try to
find someone else' or I'm out of here. And I'll be damned if I'm
going to give up that early. . . . I'll be (expletive) if I'm going
to be the fall guy here.'' &QL; 
Save the ice
</P>
<P>
   The NHL's new edict to eliminate skate arounds before the second
and third periods to preserve the quality of the ice surface goes
into effect on Monday. If anyone besides the goalie and the five
starting skaters take a few spins around the rink to warm up, the
team will be given a two-minute bench minor.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes defenseman  &UR; Gerald Diduck rolled his eyes when asked
about the new rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, in this age of environmentalism, it's save the whale,
save the fox, save the deer,'' Diduck quipped. ``You might as well
save the ice, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need any stinking skate around anyway. Just drop the
puck and let's go.'' &QL; 
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
</P>
<P>
   San Jose Sharks Coach  &UR; Darryl Sutter apparently isn't giving the
Coyotes, the Dallas Stars or anyone else, for that matter, much
chance of challenging the Detroit Red Wings for the Stanley Cup
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until somebody takes the Stanley Cup away from the Detroit Red
Wings, there's nobody else,'' Sutter said. ``They'e the best team
in the league by 10 miles. I mean, is there any other team in the
league that can play four lines and have their starting goaltender
out for a period of time and it doesn't bother them at all?'' &QL; 
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
</P>
<P>
   When the Mighty Ducks were in Chicago last week, Selanne used a
day off to go see a taping of the ``Jerry Springer Show.'' He
managed to get front-row seats for himself and Anaheim rookies
 &UR; Mike Crowley, Antti
 &UR; Aalto and  &UR; Johan Davidsson.
</P>
<P>
   The show had a Thanksgiving theme, featuring families squabbling
about the holiday season. Three tables full of food were on the
stage, and it wasn't long before it turned into a food fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got hit in the leg with a slice of cake,'' said Aalto, a big
fan of the show. ``I try to watch it every night. After the show,
we got to meet him. I guess I'll go to the movie next.''
</P>
<P>
   Several teammates wished they had been there.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least 12 guys said they wanted to go,'' Selanne said, ``but
I only had four tickets.'' &QL; 
The borrowers
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to many published reports, the Pittsburgh Penguins
haven't officially been awarded a $20 million loan from a French
bank to meet their upcoming payroll. A bankruptcy court judge won't
make the ruling until later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the loan,'' Penguins attorney  &UR; Robert G. Sable said.
``We'll run out of money in two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins, reportedly worth between $75 million and $105
million, are $127 million in debt already. According to court
documents, they owe everyone from  &UR; Mario Lemieux to, get this,
$4,000 to the March of Dimes and $7.43 to a Georgia-based
long-distance phone company. &QL;

SCHOENFELD: ALL WAITING FOR COYOTES TO FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ If it seems like all of Canada _ and the rest
of the NHL for that matter _ is waiting for the Coyotes to fall on
their face after such a hot start, it's probably because they are,
Coach Jim Schoenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'm sure that's what people out there are waiting for,''
Schoenfeld said before Saturday night's game against the Flames.
``That's just natural. When you're a new team and you're leading
the pack, people want to see if you're for real or not. All we can
do is maintain our winning edge and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach John Tortorella said the Coyotes should take
advantage of the perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a type of motivation you can use as a player, as
a coach, as an organization,'' he said. ``People still don't
believe in the Phoenix Coyotes and what they're trying to do as a
team. People have their opinions, but we know what we're trying to
accomplish. We're going to continue to strive and ... in June,
hoefully make people believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes captain keith Tkachuk said he could care less what
people are saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can say ... I don't care what they say,'' Tkachuk said.
``We deserve a little credit. I know it's early. We want to be
there at the end. That's when we want to stick it in everybody's
faces.'' &QL; 
GM meetings
</P>
<P>
   General managers from around the NHL will descend on the Valley
today for the start of two days of league meetings, which begin
Monday at the Phoenician Resort in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items on the agenda to be discussed include the
league's participation in the 2002 Winter Olympics at Salt Lake
City, the idea of adopting a shootout rule to end overtime ties,
and the financial burdens being felt by the six Canadian teams.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is expected to be resolved this week, however. The GMs
and the league's Board of Governors aren't expected to vote on any
sweeping changes until they meet again in February.
</P>
<P>
   As for the the Olympics, it is believed the NHL will once again
interrupt its season to allow its players to participate, but only
under the assurances that NBC televise the games in prime time. &QL; 
Slapshots
</P>
<P>
   Entering Saturday's game, the Coyotes had eight players who were
a plus-10 or better in the plus-minus rankings. Pittsburgh and
Toronto were the next closest with three. Detroit has only two, as
does Edmonton and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The eight Phoenix players and their rankings: Tkachuk (+14),
Rick Tocchet, Juha Ylonen and Jyrki Lumme (each +11), Jeremy
Roenick, Dallas Drake, Oleg Tverdovsky and Keith Carney (each +10).
</P>
<P>
   Goalie coach Benoit Allaire joined the team in Calgary before
Saturday 's game after spending the past three days working with
the Coyotes' two young goalies in Springfield of the American
Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might never let him leave again,'' joked Coach Jim
Schoenfeld, refer ring to Wednesday's 4-3 loss in Edmonton, which
Allaire didn't attend.
</P>
<P>
   During the Coyotes' 14-game unbeaten streak, the team went 42
days and nights without a loss. During their 17-game string of
allowing two goals or fewer, they went 53 days and nights between
giving up more than two.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Sean Gagnon, an eforcer who the Coyotes have playing
in Springfield this season, was given a four-game suspension for an
intent-to-injure misconduct during a game last week. &QL;

RANGERS WILLING TO SPEND TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers are preparing to lose some $18 million next
season, even if they manage to attract 3 million fans. Why? Because
the Rangers' new ownership is prepared to step up and play with the
big boys.
</P>
<P>
   Club President  &UR; Tom Schieffer, with the full backing of new
owner  &UR; Tom
 &UR; Hicks, plans to increase the club's payroll to somewhere near $75
million. He has decided to play with the heavyweights, no matter
the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``This market expects you to compete, and we think the price of
competing is is going to be in that range,'' Schieffer said. ``And
we do have a very good team without  &UR; Randy Johnson on it. We don't
want to tear it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Within one day of Johnson choosing to play for the Diamondbacks,
the Rangers started showing their commitment, signing first baseman
 &UR; Rafael
 &UR; Palmeiro and shortstop  &UR; Royce Clayton for a combined $63 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to do what it takes to get this club to the next
level,'' Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro represents a significant upgrade over  &UR; Will Clark, who
signed with Baltimore on Saturday, in several areas.
</P>
<P>
   In five seasons with Baltimore, Palmeiro hit .292 with 182
homers, 553 RBIs and &UR; a .545 &UR; slugging percentage. In five seasons
with Texas, Clark hit .308 with 77 homers, 397 RBIs and a .485
slugging percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Palmeiro is far more dependable. He missed six games in
five years with the Orioles. Clark missed 136 games, nearly a full
season, in his five years with Texas. &QL; 
Where's the game heading? &QL; 
If it seems like the money has gone wacko in baseball, well, maybe
it has. The game's highest-paid player (at least for the moment),
 &UR; Mo &UR; Vaughn, is being paid an average salary of $13.33 million. At
the beginning of the decade the game's five most expensive players
_  &UR; Robin
 &UR; Yount,  &UR; Kirby Puckett,  &UR; Roger Clemens,  &UR; Eddie Murray and  &UR; Don
Mattingly _ earned a combined $13.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yount was the game's highest-paid player in 1990, earning $3.2
million. Baseball's average salary has increased from $589,483 to
$1,377,196 (and that's without  &UR; Kevin Brown having signed).
</P>
<P>
   Only one club whose payroll was under $47 million managed to
have a winning record. That club? The Toronto Blue Jays. &QL; 
Road grays &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the Los Angeles Dodgers' uniform change may not be
as destructive as previously believed. The change in road uniforms
will actually be a throw back to the club's days in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' road gray uniforms will no longer read ``Dodgers''
across the chest but rather a scriped ``Los Angeles,'' much like
the days when the club's road uniforms read ``Brooklyn.'' In
addition, there will be a bit more blue stitching in the uniform. &QL; 
The hit list &QL; 
 &UR; Wonder if they still get their cut: Rafael Palmeiro's agents,  &UR; Bob
 &UR; Gilhooly and  &UR; Jim Bronner, has basically nothing to do in
negotiating the five-year $45 million contract the first baseman
reached with the Rangers last week. Palmeiro's financial adviser
hammered out the deal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback (to the very first free agent): Andy Messersmith.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Daddy Warbucks nearly stuck the big one: It turns out
Diamondbacks managing general partner Jerry Colangelo did offer
Bernie Williams an eight-year deal worth $100 million. At least,
that's what the owners' player relations committee is saying.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Another feather in his tarnished cap: As early as last spring,
Florida's former owner,  &UR; Wayne Huizenga, was aware that the 2000
All-Star Game could be taken away from the Marlins. Not once did he
mention that news during negotiations to sell the club. &QL; 
Extra bases &QL; 
One of Atlanta's biggest shortcomings, its bench, has been upgraded
in a major way. The Braves' bench, as of today, looks like this:
 &UR; Otis &UR; Nixon,  &UR; Ozzie Guillen,  &UR; Gerald Williams,  &UR; Keith Lockhart and
 &UR; Eddie Perez. Only one more spot is open.
</P>
<P>
   The large and intimidating presence of  &UR; Dave Parker will no
longer be visible on the St. Louis Cardinals' bench. The former MVP
will not return as the Cardinals hitting coach. Expect Manager
 &UR; Tony La Russa to try to coax  &UR; Doug Rader out of retirement. &QL; 
The rumor mill &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets are talking about bringing major league stolen
base king  &UR; Rickey Henderson to Queens to become their everyday left
fielder and leadoff hitter. Seattle has also shown an interest.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have received several inquiries about second baseman
 &UR; Eric Young, who will be paid $4.5 million each of the next three
years, practically a bargain these days. &QL;

PULL OUT YOUR TRUSTY CALCULATOR

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS - H'llo, you have reached the BCS 24-hour crisis
hotline. UCLA fans, press one. Kansas State fans, press two.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona fans, press any number.
</P>
<P>
   If the line is busy, please hold. A counselor will be with you
shortly.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second quarter, the TWA Dome announcer leaned into
the microphone and when he gave the score his deep voice sounded
like the voice of God delivering an answered prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Miami 49, UCLA 45.
</P>
<P>
   Lordy, you should have heard the cheers. Kansas State fans
hugged. They jumped up and down as if on pogo sticks. They shrieked
with joy. This town hasn't heard such noise since Mark McGwire hit
No. 70.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's late collapse which knocked Arizona out of the Rose Bowl
helped clarify a muddled title picture. There no longer were three
unbeaten teams. K-State would be returning to Tempe to play (fill
in the blank) in the Fiesta Bowl assuming the 11-0 Wildcats put
away underdog Texas A&AMP;M and the explosive 'Cats were in command,
leading 17-3. Purple-clad fans had cell phones pressed to their
ears, calling Valley hotels.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing is certain in college football this year _ not a
lead, or a BCS ranking.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M fought back, pushing K-State into overtime. Then Wildcat
faithful watched in horror as a young squire named Sirr Parker
caught a short pass _ oh no _ slipped a tackle, stiff-armed a
K-State defender _ stop him! _ and kept churning until he covered
32 yards and stretched his body across the goal line. Touchdown.
A&AMP;M, 36-33.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it was over. K-State's undefeated season. It's 19-game
winning streak. Its national championship dream.
</P>
<P>
   As stunned Wildcat players wandered off the field, their fans
glum to their shoelaces, the college football world scratched its
head and asked, ````Now'' what?''
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-back upsets created what what is akin to a national
crisis in which the president and vice president are unable to
serve. Who is next in line? The speaker-elect of the house? Who is
college football's Bob Livingston _ according to the Bowl
Championship Series?
</P>
<P>
   Florida State?
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, but we won't know for sure until the math whizzes
log on to the BCS computer and and begin crunching the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely. Probably. Maybe. The BCS is a hopelessly complex
formula that weighs a Heinz variety of factors and assesses a
numerical rating to each of the nation's top teams.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to figure it out one afternoon and got a nosebleed.
</P>
<P>
   If UCLA, K-State and Tennessee had won Saturday the situation
would have been similar to three unbeaten horses crossing the
finish line at Churchill Downs simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   If the NCAA ran horse racing, it would compare the animals'
blood lines, schedules, opponents' schedules, margins of victory,
jockey and thoroughbred writers polls, the ``Daily Racing Form''
power rating and then announce that War Admiral and Gallant Fox
qualify for a run-off with the winner being named the Tostitos
Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the third horse, Yougottabekiddin, is eliminated, the
victim of a low sperm count index.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee went into the final week of the season ranked No. 1 in
the BCS with a 4.99 rating. UCLA was at 5.03. K-State 6.31. We
accept these numbers without question just as we accept as fact the
calculated distance between Earth and Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the numbers will change again. Florida State may climb
from fourth to second in the ratings, perhaps by a fraction of a
point. The scoring is like Olympic rhythmic gymastics.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sagarin, whose power rating is one of the criteria used by
the BCS, predicted a ``huge bombshell is going to hit this
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   The MIT grad was right, although the bomb he spoke of wasn't the
one A&AMP;M dropped. Sagarin had done the math and announced that if
the Wildcats won they would move up from third to first in the BCS
rankings, for the first time, and qualify for the big game.
</P>
<P>
   But K-State never was a Fiesta Bowl team according to my pocket
calculator. The Wildcats' early season schedule was too easy. Bill
Snyder's team played Northeast Louisiana and Northern Illinois and
the Division I-AA Indiana State Sycamores. The Wildcats managed to
beat them, 201-14.
</P>
<P>
   K-State should have saved one of those touchdowns for the
overtime in the Big 12 championship game. But as they say around
the BCS, hindsight is 20.062/20.017. &QL;

   MIAMI - Even if they prevailed, even if their quarterback
provided another miracle and the winning streak continued to mask
the odor, any computer worth its gigabytes would've spit them out
like a cheap virus.
</P>
<P>
   When you reduce college football to decimal points, there is no
room for a team that gives up 689 yards to a second-tier outfit.
That surrenders a 38-21 lead with the Fiesta Bowl on the line. That
has two weeks to prepare and allows a running back named Edgerrin
to scamper for 299 yards.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA does not deserve to play for a national championship. Thank
the Bruins for ending the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't play good defense, you don't deserve to be a
national champion,'' UCLA Coach Bob Toledo said. ``You've got to
stop somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins couldn't cover or tackle or produce one defensive
stand. They couldn't provide one glimmer of competence, one reason
to believe they were worthy of the crown. In fact, UCLA's defense
accomplished only one thing on a stunning afternoon in the tropics:
</P>
<P>
   They stopped Arizona from going to the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for Pasadena and Wisconsin's Ron Dayne, the
Bruins will now practice in the middle of the Los Angeles freeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to beat Wisconsin,'' Bruins lineman Brad Melsby
promised.
</P>
<P>
   As Miami celebrated a truly wonderful victory, a game that
rekindled all the magic the Orange Bowl once held, the Bruins were
in ruins. Inside the loser's locker room, boxes of uneaten pizza
were stacked on tables. Heads were buried in hands. Numbness was
setting in.
</P>
<P>
   There is cruel irony in all of this. If not for the BCS, UCLA
never would have agreed to make up this game, a September match-up
canceled by hurricane. But to argue that Miami would've been more
vulnerable then is both futile and erroneous. The Hurricanes
already were locked into a bowl entering Saturday's skirmish, and
fresh off a 53-point loss to Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was David vs. Goliath,'' Miami's Derrick Hamm said. ``And
God came through for David again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, no slingshots necessary. There was no Goliath on this
field, and the Bruins knew it.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they knew they were stretching their destiny. They
had escaped once too often, their salvation tree plucked bare. And
when asked if he felt comfortable with a 17-point lead in the
second half, offensive lineman Andy Meyers was shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you watching the same game I was watching?'' he asked.
``The way our defense was playing, I wouldn't have been comfortable
if we were up 48.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly the stuff of champions.
</P>
<P>
   For too long, UCLA has been a one-trick pony, riding its
thrill-seeking quarterback on a 20-game odyssey. McNown was
brilliant as usual on Saturday, from the subtleties of his footwork
to passes that hit nearly every receiver in stride. He is as good
as it gets in college football, worthy of the Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   McNown deserved a lot more than what he got, which was no
support and a face full of pepper spray as he left the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great shot at the national title,'' McNown said. ``We
did everything we could, especially offensively. It hurts deeply. I
hate to see the guys in a somber mood.''
</P>
<P>
   John Junker, executive director of the Fiesta Bowl, was in the
air when this all happened. He left the Orange Bowl with UCLA ahead
and surging. He landed in Atlanta with only two unbeaten teams
vying for the big prize.
</P>
<P>
   This is good for Valley hotel owners, who wouldn't have seen a
dime from UCLA's commuter fan base. This is good for the Fiesta
Bowl, which can claim a national champion without a third party
screaming to the heavens. But this is not necessarily good for
college football.
</P>
<P>
   Every year the BCS works is another year removed from a
much-needed playoff format.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be worse things for college football than being on
the front page of the sports section every day for the past two
weeks,'' Junker said.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, at least the Fiesta Bowl will be spared the paper
tigers from UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if they can only import McNown as designated quarterback.

FASSEL FACTOR PLAYS HAVOC WITH CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Against the Cardinals, they look like the 1985
Chicago Bears, the Pittsburgh Steelers of the 1970s, Vince
Lombardi's Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Giants, coached by former Cardinals offensive
coordinator Jim Fassel, can do no wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In three victories over the Cardinals the past two years, the
Giants have been unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   They've outscored the Cardinals, 80-30.
</P>
<P>
   They have gained 1,189 yards to the Cardinals' 828.
</P>
<P>
   They have run for 581 yards to the Cardinals' 138.
</P>
<P>
   They are plus-3 in turnover ratio.
</P>
<P>
   They have 21 sacks to the Cardinals' 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of hearing about it,'' Cardinals quarterback Jake
Plummer said. ``I've been here two years, and they've beaten us
pretty good every time I've played against them. It's something I
want to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   A loss to the Giants (4-8) today at Sun Devil Stadium would mean
the Cardinals (6-6) were swept by a team under .500, one that has
lost four of five games, two by a combined score of 68-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like it what has happened with the Giants the last
couple of years,'' Cardinals center Aaron Graham said. ``It's up to
us to respond and find a way to beat them. He (Fassel) has had our
number. I think we'll dig down deep and figure him out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are trying to make the playoffs for the first time
in a non-strike year since 1975. The Giants are trying to finish
respectably.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many stakes on the table,'' Cardinals defensive
end Simeon Rice said. ``We've got to get it done. We're trying to
get our game together for postseason play. (The Giants) are trying
to get things together for memorable moments.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Giants beat the Cardinals, 34-7, at Giants Stadium,
Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin and his staff caught a lot of flak from
fans for being ``outcoached'' by Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, who hired Fassel three years ago and has remained friends
with him, thinks the Giants' players deserve credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's overblown,'' Cardinals defensive coordinator
Dave McGinnis said of Fassel's influence. ``They've just
executed.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said players win games; it's a coach's job to get players
in the best position to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't played well against the Giants,'' Tobin said. ``We
haven't controlled the line of scrimmage. We haven't been able to
run the ball or stop the run.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals players think that Fassel has an advantage in that he
is familiar with their talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has seen our players,'' Cardinals fullback Larry Centers
said. ``He has watched them in practice. He has a feel for what
certain players' weaknesses are.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cardinals quarterback Coach Geep Chryst points out that
Plummer, running backs Adrian Murrell and Mario Bates and guards
Chris Dishman and Lester Holmes weren't with the team when Fassel
was coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say Jim knows everything about this team, but we have a
lot of players Jim never was around,'' Chryst said.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel doesn't think he has the Cardinals figured out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time we played them, we played a very good game,''
Fassel said. ``We've been fortunate. We've played well against
them. I don't think there's anything (special).
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't know any more how to read (the Cardinals) than you
guys (reporters) would. From my standpoint, this is like any game.
We work hard to prepare, to put the game plan together and then the
bottom line is go out and execute it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel isn't the only former Cardinal coach on the Giants staff.
Offensive coordinator Jim Skipper was Arizona's running backs coach
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Giants starting quarterback Kent Graham was with the Cardinals
the past two years. But Cardinals backup quarterback Dave Brown
came from the Giants in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this team is more hung up about playing the Giants
because the Giants dominated in the past,'' Brown said. ``But to
the Giants, this is just another game. They play loose, and it
shows up. They go out and have fun and have won the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, I think this team gets so hyped up because we're
playing the Giants. Maybe it's paralysis by analysis, and we don't
play as well. We played our worst game of the year there this
season. So the Giants are a big hurdle for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' biggest problem in previous games is stopping New
York's rushing attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants ran for 239 yards at Sun Devil Stadium last season,
their most since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just knowing what they think about our defensive line is
enough motivation,'' strong safety Tommy Bennett said. ``The Giants
question our defensive line and whether we can play against the
run. I think our defensive line is going to play really well
(today).''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants will be going against a Cardinals defense that will
be minus three starters _ tackle Eric Swann (knee), middle
linebacker Ronald McKinnon (knee) and cornerback Tom Knight
(hamstring). It's the worst physical shape the defense has been in
all season.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals players say they won't use injuries as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is essential for us, regardless of who is out there,
regardless of who is hurt,'' Rice said. ``If we fall (today), we
fall hard. You always want your destiny in your hands. In order for
it to be in our hands, we have to take it. We want to run the table
to make the playoffs. We don't want to make the playoffs by it just
falling in our laps.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer thinks the Cardinals have to play one of their most
physical games in order to finally beat the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to come and be the physical team and make them react
to us,'' Plummer said. ``We have to fight force with force, be the
stronger team, the faster team, the hardest-hitting team. We have
to show them we're not going back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't worry about what's happened in the past. We're about
the future now. We're worried about this one.'' &QL;

McNOWN COULDN'T DO IT ALL 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Punt, pass, run, block, catch.
</P>
<P>
   Cade McNown has done whatever has been asked of him in his four
seasons at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe somebody should have asked him to play defense.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA quarterback had the best day of his career Saturday,
completing 26 of 35 passes for a school-record 513 yards, tying his
own record with five touchdown passes and running for the Bruins'
other touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   And, yet, it was also the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to two key fourth-quarter fumbles and a defense that
looked as if it would struggle to stop Poly High, McNown's
performance wasn't enough to prevent UCLA's national championship
hopes from evaporating in a 49-45 loss before 46,819 at the Orange
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   There were no tears or thrown helmets from McNown afterward. It
was hard, however, to mask the disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   McNown was polite, but feisty before a group of 20 reporters
outside the UCLA locker room. It was also clear that he wondered
why more of the Bruins weren't like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating,'' McNown said. ``I mean, we did everything
we could offensively. We made a lot of plays, we put up 45 points _
not off turnovers, but off driving the football and making plays. I
don't want to go out of a national championship race this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran up and down the field. We dictated the momentum on
offense. It wasn't even close. It was a joke. We rolled on 'em.
What more can I say?''
</P>
<P>
   McNown, who criticized his receivers after he passed poorly
against Arizona, was easier on Brad Melsby and Brian Poli-Dixon,
who lost fourth-quarter fumbles fighting for extra yardage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to remember to get down and really tuck the ball
away,'' said McNown. ``When you make moves, there's going to be a
backside trailer. (The fumbles) played a part in it, but we still
put up 45 points.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown had maintained all season that he only cared to win the
Heisman Trophy if it was a byproduct of the team's success. Indeed,
he played well mostly when the Bruins needed him and they happened
to need him all day Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played like a first-round draft choice,'' said offensive
coordinator Al Borges. ``It certainly wasn't his fault. I think he
threw one bad ball the whole day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He made plays just like he's made all year,'' guard Andy
Meyers said. ``He's a playmaker and a leader. He led us with pride
and with honor, but he finally lost a battle.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown threw touchdown passes of 77 yards to Danny Farmer, 7 and
61 yards to Poli-Dixon and a 59-yard score to Melsby. The Bruins,
facing third-and-goal at the 1-yard-line midway through the fourth
period, put the ball in McNown's hands again.
</P>
<P>
   He kept the ball on an option play and beat strong safety Edward
Reed to the corner flag for a touchdown that put the Bruins ahead
45-35 with 5:40 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew unless we scored every time we got the ball, it was
still going to be tight,'' McNown said. ``Every time they got the
ball, just about every time they scored a touchdown. We knew if the
ball was in their hands, they were going to score.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown, who led the Bruins to fourth-quarter comebacks against
Oregon State and Stanford, had a chance to do it again after
Cheyane Caldwell returned the kickoff 24 yards to the UCLA 45 with
50 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-yard swing pass to DeShaun Foster got the ball to the Miami
43 with 42 seconds left. A hook-and-lateral play with Melsby and
Foster moved it to the Miami 37 with 24 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   But McNown was forced to scramble for 3 yards, nearly had his
pass intercepted by linebacker Dan Morgan and then on the final
play, his Hail Mary pass into the end zone for backup quarterback
Drew Bennett was knocked away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had a pretty good chance,'' McNown said. ``We
almost got that last pass in the end zone. They got a lot of breaks
today and we suffered quite a bit. We didn't get so many.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami players, coaches and fans stormed the field as if they'd
won the national championship. McNown made his way through the maze
and said some Miami fans dumped pepper spray on him as he headed up
the tunnel to UCLA's locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to take this if you get real emotional,'' McNown
said. ``I don't get too high or too low. You have to stand back and
say we gave it a great shot but there's nothing we could do.''

FULMER PULLS VOLS TOGETHER FOR WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
Tennessee 24, Mississippi State 14 
COACH Coach pulls Tennessee together for win 
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - There is nothing like an autumn Saturday in the South
to prove that not all of America has relaxed its grip on what is
important, like the proper way to cook greens, or how to address
your elders, or the importance of college football.
</P>
<P>
   Down here, some coaches still wear ties on the sidelines. State
troopers still escort coaches on and off the field. Fans aren't
embarrassed to ring cow bells or sing corny songs whenever the mood
hits, which is often. And players can actually tackle.
</P>
<P>
   So it's fitting that of the three undefeated teams that played
Saturday, only one, Tennessee, remained that way. The No. 1-ranked
Volunteers didn't do anything flashy but they were good enough to
beat Mississippi State, 24-14, in the SEC Championship game in the
Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Volunteers talked about not following in
the footsteps of UCLA or Kansas State, which were upset Saturday.
``Like (linebacker Al Wilson) said before the game, we're not
Kansas State, we're not UCLA,'' said receiver Peerless Price. ``We
control our destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers (12-0) are assured a spot in the Fiesta Bowl,
Jan. 4, and will find out their opponent today when results of the
Bowl Championship Series standings are announced.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a dream season for the Volunteers, who weren't
expected to do much after the loss of quarterback Peyton Manning,
the NFL's top draft choice. And when the Volunteers lost their best
running back, Jamal Lewis, to a knee injury in the fourth game,
their chances of playing for their first national title since 1951
seemed dismal.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers credit their coach, Phillip Fulmer, for holding
them together. He is an unlikely hero. Rumpled, overweight and with
a terminal lack of glibness, Fulmer doesn't look the part. But he
leads. Sure, not the way Mississippi State coach Jackie Sherrill
does. Sherrill, after all, once had a bull castrated to get his
Bulldogs ready to play Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And after Mississippi State upset Arkansas late this season,
Sherrill sat in his office chair, rubbing two Razorbacks' tusks
together in his hand. Got them in Texas a few years back, Sherrill
said, after shooting a Razorback from behind.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer spins no such yarns. He's a regular guy, who, if he were
your neighbor, you wouldn't think twice about loaning him a power
tool.
</P>
<P>
   After last week's victory over Vanderbilt, Fulmer, his wife and
three daughters drove the three hours from Nashville to Knoxville.
They enjoyed the family time, stopping at a Cracker Barrel
restaurant along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer, ever the adventurer, had the meatloaf.
</P>
<P>
   Calmly, he has led this team week-by-week. Finally beating
Florida. Overcoming Lewis's injury. Nuturing quarterback Tee Martin
through growing pains. He never let the pressures of coaching at
Tennessee, where over 100,000 ``Rocky Top`` singing fans show up
for every home game, get to him.
</P>
<P>
   In his own way, Sherrill also did a remarkable job this season.
The Bulldogs have no stars, Sherrill is quick to point out, and he
claims not one of his defensive starters will ever be drafted.
</P>
<P>
   That's debatable. But what the Bulldogs, as well as the
Volunteers, will do is knock you into next week. Ball carriers who
cared to dance in Saturday's game paid a painful price.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if the SEC office had banned missed tackles, along
with the cowbells that Mississippi State fans love to clang.
</P>
<P>
   That's why SEC football is better than the Pac-10, where defense
has gone the way of the Anasazi.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 this year might as well of been the Big Sky
Conference. Scores were astronomical. Offenses gorged themselves.
At least now we know what happened to track and field. The season
was moved to the fall.
</P>
<P>
   When the league's best team, UCLA, gives up 49 points to
unranked Miami, there are problems.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC title game was a stark contrast. Tennessee's defense
gave up nothing. Mississippi State scored on a 70-yard interception
return and an 83-yard punt return.
</P>
<P>
   The mark of the best teams is how they react when they're down.
When the Bulldogs went ahead, 14-10, in the fourth quarter, the
Vols were tough enough to come back.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who struggled most of the night, found Price for a
41-yard touchdown. The defense forced a fumble and Martin tossed
another touchdown pass. In less than three minutes, the Volunteers
were ahead, 24-14, their trip to the Fiesta Bowl confirmed against
an as of yet faceless opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Only 35,000 or so their fans will follow. If you don't know the
words to ``Rocky Top,'' they won't be hard to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's like ``Boomer Sooner,'''' said John Junker,
Fiesta Bowl executive director. ``It just repeats itself. Although
I think there is a `Good ole` in there somewhere.''  &QL;

FLORIDA STATE SITTING PRETTY

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Now it's up to the computers. But not the way everyone
figured. After weeks of mashing of the Bowl Championship Series
rankings of undefeated Kansas State, UCLA, and Tennessee, a new set
of problems developed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   How to differentiate between one-loss teams.
</P>
<P>
   With No. 3 UCLA and No. 2 Kansas State each losing Saturday, the
BCS rankings that will determine who plays in the Fiesta Bowl for
the national championship now must produce a winner between
one-loss teams such as Florida State and Ohio State, each of whom
thought they needed a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   What happened Saturday was as bizarre as it was dramatic. UCLA
began the day with a stunning 49-45 loss to Miami in the Orange
Bowl in a game that was not decided until the final play.
</P>
<P>
   That effectively knocked the Bruins out of the Fiesta Bowl and
into the Rose Bowl, where they are likely to play Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Big 12 championship game in St. Louis. Knowing
that UCLA had lost, all Kansas State had to do was beat Texas A&AMP;M
to get to the Fiesta. With a 27-12 lead in the fourth quarter, it
seemed the Wildcats were doing that.
</P>
<P>
   But the Aggies came back, forcing the game into overtime and
winning with a controversial touchdown in the second OT, 36-33.
</P>
<P>
   That loss could and probably will be devastating to the
Wildcats, who are likely to fall behind Ohio State and Florida
State in the BCS rankings and now could be headed to the Sugar
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State now appears to be in the Fiesta to face Tennessee,
which hung on to defeat Mississippi State, 24-14, in the SEC title
game Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The other BCS bowl matchups were also in doubt. Texas A&AMP;M is in
the BCS and most likely will get a Sugar bid, possibly vs. Ohio
State, while Syracuse was most likely in the Orange, possibly vs.
Florida. But most everything was on hold until Sunday.

YES, SIRR, AGGIES STUN KANSAS STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Sirr Parker's headlong dive clipped the end-zone
pylon, touching off the deepest dogpile of maroon-clad football
players in the three-year history of the Big 12 conference.
</P>
<P>
   Parker's touchdown in the second overtime of yesterday's league
title game culminated a furious comeback that saw Texas A&AMP;M stun
Kansas State, 36-33, behind the 11th-hour magic of a backup
tailback and a backup quarterback who spent most of their senior
seasons in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   But Parker and Branndon Stewart were front and center during
crunch time in the Trans World Dome. They hooked up on the
game-tying touchdown and two-point conversion with 1:05 remaining
in regulation, as well as the game-winning, 32-yard strike in
overtime that allowed A&AMP;M (11-2) to win the Big 12 title and ended
the national championship dreams of Kansas State (11-1).
</P>
<P>
   With the triumph, the Aggies, ranked 10th in The Associated
Press poll, landed a berth in the Bowl Championship Series and will
play in either the Jan. 1 Sugar Bowl or the Jan. 2 Orange Bowl. A
likely scenario has A&AMP;M playing No. 5 Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl,
but the bowl pairings will not be finalized until today.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M players cared little about their postseason destination last
night as they mobbed Parker, who turned a short slant pattern into
a game-winning touchdown pass on a third-and-17 play that allowed
the Aggies to win as 14-point underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the best feelings in the world, until the guys
started yelling and taking away my oxygen,'' Parker said of the
postgame pile of happy, hugging humanity. ``This shows Aggies don't
ever give up fighting. When the clock says `zero,' we're still
fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, A&AMP;M never led yesterday's game until after the
fourth-quarter clock showed 0:00. A&AMP;M took a 30-27 lead on Russell
Bynum's 18-yard field goal in the first overtime, but watched
Kansas State kicker Martin Gramatica answer with a 22-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   Another Gramatica field goal opened the second overtime, but A&AMP;M
answered with the slant pattern heard 'round the BCS rankings.
Suddenly, a team that managed just 173 yards in last week's 26-24
loss to Texas had exploded for 452 yards (6.3 per play) and 25
first downs against the nation's No. 2 defense.
</P>
<P>
   A team that trailed, 27-12, at the start of the fourth quarter
had rallied behind Stewart, who threw for 235 yards, three
touchdowns and a pivotal two-point conversion in the fourth quarter
and overtime. Stewart, a Stephenville native who was replaced in
the starting lineup Oct. 3, threw for a season-high 324 yards as an
emergency replacement for the injured Randy McCown (broken
collarbone).
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M began its comeback with a 10-play, 78-yard touchdown drive
that ended with Stewart hitting Leroy Hodge for 13 yards to trim
the deficit to 27-19. With Kansas State attempting to run out the
clock, linebacker Warrick Holdman knocked the ball loose from
Wildcats quarterback Michael Bishop (442 yards total offense) with
2:26 remaining and Cornelius Anthony recovered at the Wildcats'
35-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Four plays later, Stewart hit Parker for a 9-yard scoring toss,
then followed with a two-point conversion pass to Parker to tie the
game, 27-27, and set up the duo's additional heroics in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there will be another Big 12 comeback to match
this one for a long time,'' Stewart said. ``All week, people were
saying, `The Aggies don't have the offense. The Aggies don't have
the passing game. The Aggies can't do this. The Aggies can't to
that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I got sick of hearing it. We're Big 12 champs.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they are. And, by beating a Kansas State team ranked No.
1 in the coaches' poll, A&AMP;M defeated a top-ranked opponent for the
first time in school history.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph was sweet, said A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum, but proved
even sweeter because of the prominent roles played by Stewart and
Parker (3 catches, 49 yards, 2 TDs).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fitting the two stars of this game are guys that have
been in the background most of the year but have had a lot to do
with this team's success,'' Slocum said. ``A lot of times, guys can
become disruptive if they don't play as much as they'd hoped,
especially in their senior year. But these guys have handled it
with class. I couldn't be more pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State players, on the other hand, could not have been
more disappointed. After the game, linebacker Jeff Kelly and
tailback Eric Hickson wept while sitting at the interview dais.
Kansas State coach Bill Snyder described it as the most painful
loss of his career, likening it to a death in the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendous setback,'' said Snyder, whose team would
have played No. 1 Tennessee in the Jan. 4 Fiesta Bowl for the
national championship if the Wildcats, No. 3 in the BCS rankings,
had won. ``A&AMP;M played extremely well in all facets. They didn't
miss a beat with Branndon Stewart in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Stewart miss an open receiver when the game was decided
during the fourth quarter and overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for Branndon and for me,'' Parker said. ``They say
it's not how you start, but how you finish. And we finished
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong enough to give A&AMP;M its first Big 12 championship.

NO SURPRISES HERE: TENNESSEE WINS

<P>
   ATLANTA _ It might have capped a nasty little trifecta that
would have produced shrieks of horror from wherever the minions of
the Bowl Championship Series are holed up at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   But irony, it seems, can travel only so far in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Top-ranked Tennessee (12-0) managed to avoid the fate of its
fellow front-runners in the BCS standings yesterday _ striking
suddenly in the fourth quarter to defeat Mississippi State, 24-14,
in the Southeastern Conference title game in front of the
second-largest crowd (74,795) in the history of the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't worried about what happened to those other two,''
said Vols receiver Peerless Price, who caught the game-winning
touchdown pass. ``We said in the locker room beforehand, we're not
UCLA, and we're not Kansas State. We've got our own job to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs (8-4) almost parlayed a gritty defense and two long
returns of a punt and an interception into the third upset of the
day. But in the end, the Vols scored twice within 28 seconds to win
the door prize.
</P>
<P>
   When Kevin Prentiss sailed 83 yards on a punt return for a 14-10
MSU lead with 8:43 remaining, the 'Dogs seemed to have fate on
their side.
</P>
<P>
   But the Vols, awakened, struck back quickly with a 75-yard drive
capped by a 41-yard scoring toss from Tee Martin to Price with 6:15
left.
</P>
<P>
   Living up to his name, Price caught the ball deep in the end
zone over backup cornerback Adesola Badon, just inserted into the
game in place of injured starter Kendall Roberson.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols then recovered a fumble at the MSU 26, and on the first
snap, Martin passed to a wide-open Cedrick Wilson in the end zone.
Finally, the 'Dogs were finished.
</P>
<P>
   The winning touchdown pass _ ``X-Takeoff'' _ was slightly
modified, Price said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the huddle,'' he said, ``Tee just said, `Peerless, I'm just
gonna throw it out there, and you've got to run out and get it. I'm
gonna throw early, because they're comin' in fast and hitting me,
so be ready.'''
</P>
<P>
   Vols coach Phillip Fullmer laughed about the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played a great defensive game against us, and we were
struggling,'' he said. ``Usually in that situation, our plan is to
just throw it out there somewhere around Peerless and see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the sudden swing, Bulldogs coach Jackie Sherrill said, ``I
didn't really feel like we had the momentum \Rafter the punt
return\S because we weren't executing our offense. No question, it
was a tough defensive game for both teams _ and our defense
probably played as well as it can. But we couldn't execute the
third down on offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come in here to spoil someone else's season. We came
here to win a championship, and we almost did.''
</P>
<P>
   The two teams sparred their way to within five seconds of a
scoreless first quarter, until an electrifying and confusing play
broke the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   From the Tennessee 18, Martin tried to go deep to Price, who was
shadowed by MSU's Robert Bean.
</P>
<P>
   As the ball descended, flags flew as the duo jostled for
possession. Bean slickly made the interception at the Bulldogs' 30
and turned back upfield as Price was both grounded and flagged for
interference.
</P>
<P>
   Bean eventually completed a meandering 70-yard scoring run as
the Vols gave halfhearted pursuit, some obviously thinking the play
had been blown dead.
</P>
<P>
   Another penalty at the goal line forced MSU's Brian Hazelwood to
kick a 35-yard extra point, but the 'Dogs were up, 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   The favor was returned in the second quarter when MSU
quarterback Wayne Madkin, pressured, lofted a weak pass that
Tennessee's Deon Grant picked off and returned 24 yards to the
'Dogs' 20. Travis Stephens dove over the stack to cap the short
drive, and the score was tied.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols then launched a drive from their 32 that reached the
MSU 7 before the Bulldogs pushed the attackers back to the 14. Jeff
Hall's 31-yard field goal gave UT a 10-7 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the third quarter, Tennessee's Al Wilson picked
off a Madkin pass and apparently took it 42 yards into the end
zone, but a penalty wiped out most of the return. Two plays later,
Travis Henry fumbled the ball back to the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols clung to the three-point lead until 8:43 remained in
the game _ when the 'Dogs suddenly struck again without snapping
the ball. Taking a punt at his 17, Prentiss moved quickly to the
sideline, turned upfield, and raced 83 yards untouched for a 14-10
MSU lead.
Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Former TCU coach Pat Sullivan was among the SEC Legends (one per
school) introduced at the start of the game. Richmond Flowers,
representing Tennessee, received a big cheer from Vols fans, but
they reserved their loudest ovation for onetime Ole Miss star
Archie Manning, father of Peyton.

FLORIDA STATE MAY GET WISH AS TWO OUT OF THREE GO BAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UCLA's loss was TCU's gain. Kansas State's loss was Florida
State's gain. And Mississippi State's loss was Tennessee's and the
Bowl Championship Series' gain.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most exciting, upsetting and bowl-shifting days in
college football history ended yesterday with the national
championship picture drawn, erased and redrawn. The results might
have vaulted TCU into the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But TCU's out-of-the-blue bowl hopes were just part of a day of
incredible mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA had the nation's longest winning streak at 20 games, but
couldn't hold a 17-point lead against Miami. Kansas State, which
inherited the longest winning streak (19 games), couldn't hold a
15-point lead against Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 Tennessee needed 14 fourth-quarter points to rally past
Mississippi State in the Southeastern Conference championship game,
24-14. The victory assured the Volunteers a place in the national
championship game, the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's opponent will be determined today when the Bowl
Championship Series announces its final computer-generated
rankings. The remaining bowl pairings also will be announced today.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State, No. 4 in last week's Bowl Championship Series
rankings, is expected to move up to No. 2 in both polls. If the
Seminoles have enough support in the BCS' computer programs, they
could wind up playing the Volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can mess it up now, can they?'' Florida State coach
Bobby Bowden told The Associated Press after the Aggies' upset of
Kansas State. ``I mean nobody behind us can go ahead of us,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   That can be answered only by the computers. Three teams with one
loss _ UCLA, Kansas State and Ohio State _ all will hope that the
numbers add up in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   The day started with three undefeated teams _ Tennessee, UCLA
and Kansas State _ atop the BCS computer standings. UCLA's 49-45
shootout loss at UCLA and Kansas State's 36-33 double-overtime loss
to Texas A&AMP;M in the Big 12 Conference championship game probably
ended the championship hopes of the Bruins and the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   Champions from the Big 12, Big Ten, Big East, Atlantic Coast,
Southeastern and Pacific-10 conferences are assured spots in the
four BCS bowls. The other two teams are at-large selections.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the probable matchups in the four BCS games: Fiesta _
Tennessee (SEC champ) vs. Florida State (ACC champ). Orange _ Texas
A&AMP;M (Big 12 champ) vs. Syracuse (Big East champ). Rose _ UCLA
(Pac-10 champ) vs. Wisconsin (Big Ten champ). Sugar _ Kansas State
(at large) vs. Ohio State (at large).
</P>
<P>
   BCS bowls pay out between $12 million to $14 million. Had UCLA
won, Arizona would have played in the Rose Bowl. That means the
Bruins' loss cost the Pac-10 a big BCS payday.
</P>
<P>
   If Kansas State and Ohio State earn at-large bids, the Big 12
and Big Ten will each earn double-their-pleasure paydays.

TURNOVERS KEY TO UCLA VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ They saw their football counterparts surrender
49 points to Miami, and vowed a UCLA team would not make the same
mistake twice Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball Bruins, drawing inspiration from the football
team's demise, decided that success comes only with reliable
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw them play and they didn't play much defense,'' Bruins
forward Travis Reed said of UCLA's football performance in its loss
to Miami. ``Through the season, they didn't play much defense and
it finally caught up with them. We decided that we've got to play
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The message, however devastating to the football team's national
championship aspirations, got through better than any lectures from
coach Steve Lavin.
</P>
<P>
   The 18th-ranked Bruins forced Oklahoma State into 25 turnovers
and defeated the 11th-ranked Cowboys 69-66 at the Wooden Classic
before an announced crowd of 14,237 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``To force an Eddie Sutton team into 25 turnovers is like
forcing a Vince Lombardi team into 12 turnovers,''' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   That's a little farfetched, but the Oklahoma State coach
conceded it was the most turnovers one of his Cowboy teams has
surrendered in eight-plus seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a lot of them were forced,'' Sutton said. ``It
seemed like we were nervous. It wasn't a good game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's defense really became a factor down the stretch, as point
guard Baron Davis made two of the biggest plays of the game. With
UCLA ahead, 67-63, Cowboys guard Adrian Peterson drove to the
basket, but Davis stole the ball and went for a layup at the other
end.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys cut the lead back to three points (69-66) and had
one final chance to send the game into overtime. But Davis blocked
Joe Adkins' 3-point attempt with four seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a top team, you have to put people away defensively,''
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he should be UCLA's defensive coordinator next season.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was his usual dominating presence despite playing in just
his second game after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his
left knee last March.
</P>
<P>
   He made his first start of the year, played a season-high 19
minutes, and had seven points and three steals, plus those two
influential defensive stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baron is probably farther along than I would have imagined,''
Lavin said. ``He's a very strong player mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis also deserved an assist for influencing the outcome of the
contest. He received an elbow from Oklahoma State point guard Doug
Gottleib at the end of the first half, which resulted in a
technical foul and Gottleib's ejection because he drew a technical
earlier in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   That left the Cowboys without their playmaker and leading
assist-man (9.4 per game) for the final 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baron ran up to me like he was going to run into me,''
Gottleib said. ``I did elbow him, but he flopped over. With about
eight minutes left before the second half, the ref came in (to the
locker room) and said I was ejected.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis admitted he took a dive, but said the elbow he received
was real.
</P>
<P>
   ``I scored a layup and ran back. I didn't say anything to
(Gottleib),'' Davis said. ``He hit me in the stomach. I saw it
coming. I flopped a little bit but it hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (4-2) also got some nice efforts from forward Jerome
Moiso (13 points, seven rebounds) and guard Earl Watson (14 points,
six assists, five rebounds).
</P>
<P>
   Although the final margin was close, the Bruins had a 64-49 lead
with 7:28 left, and also enjoyed a 14-point advantage in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   But each time it appeared UCLA would rout the Cowboys, Oklahoma
State (4-2) got back into the game with 3-point shooting. Half of
Oklahoma State's field goals (12) were 3-pointers. The Cowboys shot
45 percent from beyond the 3-point arc, but made just 36 percent of
their two-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Just another example of the Bruins' tight defense.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said UCLA had no problems remembering to improve its
defense, with the visual aid they received watching television
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you see it, it's easier to remember,'' he said.

RELY ON HEART, NOT THE ODDS

<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The computers were powerless yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Tears flowed. Hearts plummeted and soared.
</P>
<P>
   For the Kansas State Wildcats, one step away from the game of
their lifetimes, it proved to be a night that they would never
forget.
</P>
<P>
   In the horror of their 36-33 double-overtime defeat, the
heretofore unbeaten, unblemished Wildcats could offer no
explanation for what had just happened.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said he knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great hearts,'' Slocum said. ``This A&AMP;M team has character.
This team has great heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Overtime can be the cruelest word in college football. When
yesterday's second overtime was over, the Aggies rushed to swarm
the hero of the day, the all-but-once-forgotten Sirr Parker. They
hugged strangers. They hugged each other.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Dat Nguyen's eyes welled with tears as he said:
``This is one of the most special teams that I've ever been around.
We never give up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter of this Big 12 Championship Game, a mighty
roar had gone up in the Trans World Dome when it was announced that
Miami had upset UCLA. The largely purple throng of 60,798 didn't
need the convoluted Bowl Championship Series computers to tell them
what the upset meant.
</P>
<P>
   Finish off the Aggies, and the opportunity to play for No. 1
would be theirs. The Wildcats led, 17-3, when the UCLA score was
announced. From that minute on, the clock never seemed to move fast
enough for K-State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of opportunities,'' Wildcats linebacker Travis
Ochs said. ``But we just couldn't put them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, we held them all day. But we bent and
finally broke. When it got down near the end of the game, it seemed
we couldn't stop them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Overtime had been a new and chilling experience. In hindsight,
maybe the computers had been on to something. En route to 11-0, the
Wildcats had been downgraded for an allegedly undemanding schedule.
</P>
<P>
   When the Aggies did rise to challenge them in the fourth quarter
yesterday, the Wildcats appeared lost to respond _ especially their
acclaimed defense.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M, on the other hand, kept coming. Ignoring the pregame
predictions. Burying, for a day, the loss to Texas. And oblivious
to the widening shadow that Kansas State was playing under.
</P>
<P>
   How ironic was it that the forgotten quarterback found the
forgotten running back for the touchdown that would decide this
day?
</P>
<P>
   ``People were saying, `The Aggies don't have the offense. The
Aggies don't have the passing game. The Aggies don't have this. The
Aggies don't have that,''' said Branndon Stewart, whose days as an
A&AMP;M quarterback-hero were supposed to be behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick of hearing about it. We're Big 12 champs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love opportunities to prove people wrong. People say,
`Stewart can't do this. Stewart can't do that.' I love proving them
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Fate had placed Stewart, a senior from Stephenville, in this
game of games. After Randy McCown broke his collarbone, Slocum
called on Stewart, the better passer.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State was ahead by 15 points with 12 minutes left in
regulation. From that point on, Stewart faced seven third-down
situations _ he converted six, gaining 81 yards and scoring two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a story,'' Slocum said of Stewart's day.
</P>
<P>
   Around him on the field, Aggie players still hugged and danced.
At one point, Slocum himself joined a big group that was bouncing
up and down, chanting, ``Gimme some sugar! Whoop! Whoop!''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies, indeed, should expect a phone call from the Sugar
Bowl today.
</P>
<P>
   For Kansas State, the consolation prize didn't seem to matter.
</P>
<P>
   The scene in the formal interview room, with Snyder and four of
his players at the microphones, made even hardened media members
squirm.
</P>
<P>
   Swallowing back tears, Snyder said: ``I have so much pride in
these players. This may be, in their young lives, the most
difficult thing they have had to handle. The pain that comes from
this is because such an emotional investment was made by all these
young people.''
</P>
<P>
   To the coach's left, two players hung their heads and openly
sobbed.
</P>
<P>
   The dream was dashed. No slights that the bowl-system computers
had ever spit out could compare with this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told some of the young guys after the game to remember what
this feels like,'' said ebullient A&AMP;M tight end Dan Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   But no reminders were necessary, of course.
</P>
<P>
   They'll remember. Both sides will.

!head! Tennessee 
figures out 
destination !dlim! !by1! By  Paul Newberry  
!by2! Associated Press !dlim!
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; !text! &LR; ATLANTA _ Let everyone else worry about polls, quartiles
and strength of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 Tennessee knows it will be playing for the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   After No. 2 Kansas State and No. 3 UCLA fell by the wayside
Saturday, Tee Martin and the Volunteers brought a semblance of
order to the Bowl Championship Series with a 24-14 victory over No.
23 Mississippi State in the Southeastern Conference title game.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols won't know until today who their opponent will be in
the Fiesta Bowl. But they've accomplished the most important thing
_ getting there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one more big one to play,'' coach Phillip Fulmer said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy. Tennessee (12-0) needed a fourth-quarter
comeback worthy of a champion to assure itself of a chance to play
for the national title in the Jan. 4 Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, harassed most of the night by incessant blitzing, threw
two touchdown passes 28 seconds apart to erase Mississippi State's
14-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chance to play for a national championship comes around
once in a lifetime,'' said Peerless Price, who caught a 41-yard
touchdown pass that put the Vols ahead with 6:15 remaining. ``We
knew we had to pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State (8-4) went ahead 14-10 on Kevin Prentiss'
83-yard punt return with 8:43 remaining, but the Vols weren't about
to suffer the same fate as the Jayhawks and Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who was 15 of 32 for 208 yards, directed Tennessee's
struggling offense right down the field, throwing the touchdown
pass to Price to complete a five-play, 75-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after Wayne Madkin fumbled on State's next play from
scrimmage, Tennessee needed only one play to score again. Martin
stood in the pocket under heavy pressure, lofting a perfect 26-yard
pass to Cedrick Wilson for the clinching touchdown with 5:47 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``This football team showed an incredible amount of character,''
Fulmer said. ``That fourth-quarter finish was typical of what this
team was about this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee won its second straight SEC title largely because of
its defense, which limited the Bulldogs to 145 yards and didn't
allow their offense to score a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense played great,'' said Price, who had 97 yards on
six receptions and was named the game's MVP. ``They kept us in the
game. They gave us a chance to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State, a 14-point underdog, put up a tougher fight
than expected. Tennessee was held under 200 yards until the fourth
quarter, and the Bulldogs had a chance to win because of two long
returns.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bean went 70 yards for a touchdown after intercepting a
Martin pass before Prentiss stunned the largely orange-clad crowd
at the Georgia Dome with his punt return. He seemed to mesmerize
the Tennessee defenders with a stutter step, then burst down the
sideline without being touched.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin lofted a pass into the end zone just ahead of another
blitz. Price got a step on Adesola Badon and managed to cradle the
ball and get one foot down for the go-ahead touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Martin) said he was going to throw it early, because he had
been getting hit all night,'' Price said. ``Tee threw a great ball.
He gave me the opportunity to make the play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept going to the well and finally got water,'' said
Mississippi State coach Jackie Sherrill.
</P>
<P>
   Prentiss had 152 yards on six punt returns, more than
Mississippi State's offense could manage even with James Johnson,
the SEC's leading rusher, back in the lineup after being hobbled by
ankle and shoulder injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs had only 149 yards, including 38 yards on 14
carries by Johnson. Madkin completed only 10 of 22 passes for 84
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not throw and catch the ball to help out running
game,'' Sherrill said. ``But the biggest thing we didn't do was not
converting third downs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs managed only one first down in 12 third-down
situations.
</P>
<P>
   After Tennessee built a 10-7 lead at the half, defense dominated
the third quarter. The two teams combined for only 52 yards, but
that only set the stage for a thrilling final period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew Kansas State and UCLA has lost,'' Price said. ``We
knew we controlled our own destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis Henry had 120 yards rushing, 79 coming in the final
period when the State defenders finally tired.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs surprised Tennessee by jumping ahead just before
the end of the first quarter on Bean's spectacular interception
return. When Martin overthrew Price on a deep pass, Bean managed to
make a juggling catch off his knees even when bumped by the
Tennessee receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Going back the other way, Bean almost ran out of bounds along
the right sideline before cutting straight back across the field,
picking up a block from safety Ashley Cooper and tiptoeing the
final five yards to stick the ball across the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Until Saturday, Tennessee has not given up a touchdown on a
return of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols evened the score in the second period after an
interception return of its own. Madkin, under heavy pressure, made
a freshman mistake by heaving the all into coverage, and Tennessee
safety Deon Grant drifted in front of the receiver to pick off the
pass.
</P>
<P>
   Grant showed some nifty running on a 24-yard return to the
Mississippi State 20, and the Vols quickly moved into position for
Travis Stephens' 2-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols took a lead to the half when Jeff Hall connected on a
31-yard field goal after a couple of big completions by Martin. He
hooked up with Jeremaine Copeland on a 35-yard pass and Price on a
19-yarder.!end!

SLOCUM'S DECISION PAYS OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ In a game filled with monumental decisions, Texas
A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum's biggest came during the first of two
overtimes in the 36-33 victory over Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   With the first possession after the Wildcats won the coin flip
and chose to play defense, A&AMP;M neared the goal line when Branndon
Stewart connected with tight end Dan Spiller for 18 yards to the
Wildcats' 7.
</P>
<P>
   Three plunges by Dante Hall left the Aggies facing
fourth-and-one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sorely tempted to try and get the thing in,'' Slocum
said. ``But I knew if we did miss it, they had a great kicker
\RMartin Gramatica\S and would just line up and kick it. I decided
we had to take the three and take the chance we could hold them to
three.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum's decision was correct. Kansas State ended up with the
same decision on fourth-and-goal from the 1 and made the same
choice, sending Gramatica in to tie the game at 30-30 and set up
the final dramatics.
No change from 'Canes
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State coach Bill Snyder and his players said news of
Miami's 49-45 victory over UCLA that could have thrust the Wildcats
into the national championship game did not cause them to play any
differently.
</P>
<P>
   News spread from a fan behind the Wildcats' bench who was
watching on a portable television shortly after quarteback Michael
Bishop threw a 66-yard touchdown pass to Darnell McDonald for a
17-3 Kansas State lead. Moments later, the Trans World Dome
scoreboard flashed the final and Wilcats fans cheered wildly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they announced the score, it didn't have an effect on the
game,'' offensive guard Jeremy Martin said. ``If anything, it gave
us a boost. But we knew we had to come out and take care of
business. We just didn't get it done.''
Loss means much pain
</P>
<P>
   Snyder and his players were tearful during postgame interviews,
talking of national championship dreams likely gone by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pain that comes from this comes from emotional
investment,'' Snyder said. ``The greater the investment, the
greater the pain.''
No repeats for Nguyen
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M linebacker and Lombardi Award finalist Dat Nguyen said
that when the game went into overtime, memories of last week's
failed last stand in the 26-24 loss to Texas flashed through his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were in overtime,'' Nguyen recalled, ``I said to the
other guys, `Don't let this one slip away.' We let the game against
Texas slip away, but we did not let it happen again.''
Back to San Antonio?
</P>
<P>
   The Trans World Dome crowd of 60,798 was more than 5,000 shy of
a sellout _ marking the second time the game has failed to sell out
the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's match between A&AMP;M and Nebraska filled the Alamodome
to a capacity crowd of 64,824. That likely means the Big 12 will
vote to comply with an athletic directors' recommendation that the
game return to San Antonio next year.
A $50,000 catch
</P>
<P>
   Marlene Barnes Hoffman, a divorced mother of three who works at
a supermarket in Georgetown, left the Big 12 championship game with
a check that should buy a lot of groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman could have won $1 million in the ``Pepper Punt Payoff''
promotion had she caught three punts. She caught only one, but that
was worth $50,000 and more than enough salve to soothe the numerous
bruises tatooing her arms from a month of catching punts from her
boyfriend _ who was a backup punter on his high school team.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman won her shot at becoming a millionaire by filling out a
form for the Dr Pepper sweepstakes contest.

BRUINS GET BY AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Pat Burns had watched his club struggle through 65
minutes Tuesday night, the result a tie with Vancouver. Saturday
night, in a nip-and-tuck 2-1 thriller over the Pittsburgh Penguins,
the Bruins coach again watched his club, after taking a 2-0
first-period lead, hang on for dear life.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins sport an impressive seven-game unbeaten streak
(5-0-2), but the fact is, they haven't played all that well at
times. The problem isn't Boston's effort. It's partly the schedule,
which calls for the Bruins to play just three games in 13 days.
After a matinee against Montreal the day after Thanksgiving, the
Bruins had three days off until the Vancouver game. They had three
more days off until Saturday night's game, and now have four days
off before facing the Hurricanes in Carolina Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Burns believes that was a big factor in his club's trouble
containing the Penguins, who poured 34 shots on Byron Dafoe. The
goalie turned in a remarkable performance, making 17 saves in the
middle period alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saved us there,'' said Burns. ``We weren't very sharp. This
is going to sound funny, but we played like we practiced all week,
with no competition. That's exactly the way we played. A lot of
idle time. I could see when we were attacking with the puck, it was
like we were doing it in practice. Nobody's going to hit you,
nobody's going to whack you, you think it's going to be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not much comes easy, Burns added, against the Penguins. ``They
can probably throw the most talent down below the blue lines,
around the net, than anybody in the league,'' he said. ``But we
found a way to win, and that's the most important thing. When your
goaltender is sharp, you're going to win hockey games. We could
have easily lost the game, very easily. But we hung on, and that's
what counts.''
</P>
<P>
   In their last 12 games, the Bruins are 7-1-4. They went into
Saturday night with a tall order, facing the second-highest-scoring
team in the Eastern Conference and the league's top point-getter,
Jaromir Jagr. Boston countered with the best combined special teams
_ the third-best power play and second-best penalty-killing
percentage _ as well as the second-best goalie tandem in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   When all was said and done, Boston won on the strength of two
first-period goals and outstanding goaltending by Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:48, the Bruins found the net first, as Shawn Bates scored
his first goal of the season. Bates, centering Steve Heinze and
Anson Carter, was in the lineup for the first time since Nov. 19,
when he played against Florida. (He had been scratched for four
games after that and had missed Tuesday's game because of the flu.)
He made his presence known, figuring in both of the Bruins' scores.
Later in the game, however, Bates was used sparingly, because Burns
felt Joe Thornton had more experience.
</P>
<P>
   On the first goal, Dmitri Khristich, positioned behind the net
to the right of goalie Tom Barrasso, dished the puck through the
crease and it bounced off Barrasso's stick. Bates charged into the
crease after the puck, and it caromed off his right skate and into
the cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just going hard to the net,'' said Bates. ``I'll take
them any way they come.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston made it 2-0 at 17:58 on a nice individual effort by
Heinze. After Bates took a hit at center ice to advance the puck
forward, Heinze took it in on a two-on-one break. He blasted a shot
from the left circle that Barrasso stopped. But Heinze picked up
the rebound and chipped it past the netminder for his eighth goal.
Dafoe earned the second assist on the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heinzie gave the puck up to me,'' said Bates. ``I saw the
defense-man coming down, and Heinzie was yelling for the puck, so I
just tried to sideswipe the guy and just lead him and fortunately
it got through.''
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins began unleashing their barrage in the middle
period, outshooting the home team by a whopping 18-6 and pulling
within a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe was peppered by Pittsburgh and came up big, save after
save. The only one he didn't stop was Jagr's shot from the slot
that cut the lead in half at 10:55.
</P>
<P>
   From there, as they have so often this year, the Bruins
weathered the storm and walked away gratefully with the win, after
Dafoe made 10 saves in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Thursday, the schedule heats up and the Bruins will
play seven games in 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been tough mentally to get up,'' said Burns, referring
to the layoffs. ``We feel like we're in good physical condition,
which we are because we practiced all week. We're rested; the
injuries aren't there. All of sudden you get into games and you're
flat. That's the tough part.''
</P>
<P>
   When the team gets into the heat of the schedule later in the
month, Burns said he'll likely have the opposite reaction to the
one he has now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then,'' he said, ``I'll say we played too much.''

DAFOE STANDS UP TO NONSTOP ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Skill is in short supply in today's NHL. Once were the
days when we talked about the Flying Frenchmen of the '50s and
'60s, the great Euro-Oilers of the '80s. Even the Broad Street
Bullies had a few diamonds embedded in their knuckles, as did our
darlings, the Big, Bad Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   For decades the game was full of skate and shoot, great
up-and-down action that kept the crowd engaged, with no need for
high-tech jumboboards or blaring rock music to whip everyone into a
frenzy (the NBA's gift to hockey _ and look where the NBA is this
morning).
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Penguins of '98-99 likely won't win the Stanley
Cup, but they are one of the few teams in the Original 27 that can
do a little something with the puck. They are more than just
Jaromir Jagr, and there are some teams that can't cobble together
the talent of 20 guys to equal his abundance of riches.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins also attack with the likes of Martin Straka and
Alexei Kovalev, Robert Lang and Alexei Morozov. German Titov, once
Dmitri Kvartalnov's running buddy in Russia, also is no slouch in
the attacking zone. All that talent was on display for 60 minutes
Saturday night at the FleetCenter, and it all added up to a 2-1
loss to the Bruins, principally because Boston's greatest skill
level, once again, was embodied in the stick and blocker of
netminder Byron Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a lot of huge saves,'' said Hal Gill, who did what is
becoming his customary job of bailing up the dangerous Jagr, though
Jagr did strike for Pittsburgh's only goal. ``He kept us in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Once beyond the first period, which found the Penguins slow to
warm up their legs, the Bruins spent the better part of 40 minutes
in uptempo, firewagon retreat. There were times when Jagr set up
behind Dafoe's net, the puck seemingly tethered to his long stick,
with not one of Boston's five skaters daring to go after him.
Respect in this game is often measured in inches. When Jagr
controls the puck, the standard is stretched to feet, sometimes
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jagr was behind the net, I don't know how many minutes
tonight,'' said Dafoe, who turned away 33 of 34 shots _ 10 of those
saves at the combined expense of Kovalev (6) and Jagr (4). ``That
second period was a little hairy, no question.''
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins rolled up an 18-6 shot lead in the second, by far
the hardest Dafoe had to work all eve-ning. He blocked a steaming
Kovalev slapper in the early minutes, cut down a difficult,
long-range Jeff Serowik wrister at 6:53. Just before Jagr popped in
the only Pittsburgh goal at 10:55, even Bobby Dollas forced Dafoe
to come up with a sparkling stop. Before the period ended, Jagr
would have another excellent opportunity, nearly connecting for a
shorthanded strike when he turned Darren Van Impe into a
6-foot-1-inch pretzel deep in Boston territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jagr makes every player around him pretty scary,'' said Dafoe.
``And they've got the kind of team that does a lot of passing.
Kovalev (recently acquired from the Rangers in the Peter Nedved
swap) is a strong addition. That's not a dump-and-chase team.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what made Dafoe's eighth win of the year all
the more impressive, and the play of the Penguins so distinct, so
distinguishable. At least 20 teams in the league, including the
Bruins, attack with the puck as if they are connected to the
push-and-pull rods of a hockey board game. If they can break
through the morass of their opponent's neutral zone trap, they'll
do their best to funnel the puck to the middle and hope for an
honest whack or two between the circles. Boston's lone exception to
this, of course, is the Sergei Samsonov-Dmitri Khristich-Jason
Allison combination. But that line faded into anonymity against the
mighty Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably throw the most talented players at you, down
low, around the net, as any team in the league,'' reflected Bruins
head coach Pat Burns. ``They can scare you. You're looking at the
big guy (Jagr) all the time, the way he runs around, but you forget
about Kovalev ... you forget about Titov ... you forget about
Straka ... There are some pretty good hockey players there, and
they can get you into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   But only Jagr's wrister would beat Dafoe. The Bruins' surehanded
goalie dropped his goals-against average to a miniscule 1.72 and
boosted his save percentage to a dazzling .940. He is the hottest
hand this town has seen since Pete Peeters was rolling to the
Vezina 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Skill comes in many packages, many styles. Sometimes it is
embodied in the ferocious speed and agility of a powerful forward
like Jagr. Other times it can be found in the rather stationary
posture of a goalie, his lightning reflexes always at the ready.
Saturday night, Dafoe's more subtle science proved the greater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, he's got a job to do,'' said Boston captain Ray Bourque,
a wry smile crossing his face. ``He came up great, again.''

STEWART RESURRECTS AGGIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ After Vickie Stewart finally braved the delirious
celebration of Texas A&AMP;M players and coaches to embrace her son
Branndon in the immediate afterglow of the Aggies' overtime victory
against Kansas State, she reflected on a phone call Branndon made
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that day, Branndon Stewart had learned that he would
start the Big 12 championship game after it was discovered that
Randy McCown had suffered a broken collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Branndon is so low-key,'' Vickie Stewart said. ``He just said
he was going to start on Saturday and that it was all in the Lord's
hands. After all he has been through, he deserves this. I'm so
proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Some may point to divine guidance of the passes Stewart threw
late in the 36-33 victory against the Wildcats. But there was no
question that the ball _ and in a sense the game _ was firmly in
the hands of the oft-scorned senior who yesterday may have had his
finest moment of a star-crossed collegiate career in which he twice
lost his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played with a great deal of character,'' Kansas State coach
Bill Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember ever being this excited after a football
game,'' Stewart said. ``Even after the \RClass 4A\S state
championship \Rat Stephenville in 1993\S. A lot of times in
college, you don't have the same camaraderie you do in high school.
But everyone kept fighting today. And to see the gratification on
everybody's face and to know we fought through it all was really
satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fortunate enough to win this game. And I think we
played better as the game went on.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that Stewart played his finest during crunch
time, when he helped the Aggies rally from a 27-12 deficit with 40
seconds remaining in the third quarter. He completed 11 of 20
passes for 235 yards, three touchdowns and a game-tying two-point
conversion during the fourth quarter and the two overtime periods.
</P>
<P>
   For the game, Stewart was 15-of-31 with one interception _ on a
tipped ball _ for 324 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough about Branndon,'' said Sirr Parker, who
scored the game-winning touchdown after taking a perfectly timed
pass from Stewart on a slant pattern. ``He is such a strong person.
We weren't surprised by his performance today at all. We've won a
lot of big games with him before.''
</P>
<P>
   None bigger than this one, conceded Stewart, who is now 20-10 as
a starter at A&AMP;M. And though Stewart may have been low-key during
his conversation with his mother last week, he was hiding a heart
that was beating strong again at the thought of the sudden
resurrection of a career he thought was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been so excited about playing a football game,''
Stewart said. ``The whole week, I couldn't wait until Saturday. I
really didn't feel like I'd be able to compete again because Randy
was doing such a good job. To be able to go out there and compete
again was so great, especially in a game like this.''
</P>
<P>
   His rebirth once appeared short-lived. Stewart hyperextended his
right knee on the Aggies' third offensive series. But after a few
anxious moments, he warmed up again as Kansas State drove to a 10-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard it pop and thought, `Oh no.' Then it popped again and
it was all right,'' he said. ``And in a game like this, you forget
about things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be many things about this game Stewart will chose to
remember.

Free-agent signings widen gap between haves, have-nots
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
It doesn't take a Harvard education to understand baseball
economics these days. If you have enough of the green stuff, a
ticket to the postseason can practically be bought. Otherwise, make
alternate plans for October.
</P>
<P>
   In a winter of free spending on the free-agent market, there has
been a widening disparity among baseball's haves and have-nots. And
some of baseball's top officials already have concluded that as
many as 18 of the 30 teams can already be counted out of contention
for the eight playoff spots next season, just because they can't
generate enough revenue to field competitive teams.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the World Series, deals involving big money
have seemed an every-day occurrence, and it doesn't appear that an
end is near any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   The bill so far has exceeded $850 million for more than 40 free
agents and potential free agents. Mike Piazza alone accounted for a
record $91 million, seven-year contract with the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an attempt to sort out the winners and losers in this
season's free-agent market:
</P>
<P>
   Winners &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; 1. Arizona: The Diamondbucks have been the most interesting
player during this winter's spending spree. What do you expect from
a club that plays at Bank One Ballpark?
</P>
<P>
   During the past month, they have been busier than an automated
teller machine, spending close to $100 million to upgrade their
pitching staff. The signings of Randy Johnson for $52.4 million,
Todd Stottlemyre for $32 million and Armando Reynoso for $5.5
million to go along with Andy Benes and either Brian Anderson or
Omar Daal gives the Diamondbacks one of the best rotations in
baseball this side of Atlanta. Suddenly it isn't quiet in the
desert, as a championship within four years is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an exhilarating opening season for us. But we got our
brains beat out too many times. We took a lot of losses,'' said
owner Jerry Colangelo, whose club finished with the third-worst
record in baseball at 65-97. ``I wondered what kind of honeymoon
with the fans we were going to have. I looked at the lay of the
land and decided that we had to go sooner rather than later make
more of an attempt.''
</P>
<P>
   Some baseball insiders believe Arizona is becoming nothing more
than a National League West version of the Florida Marlins, who
loaded up on high-priced free agents two years ago, won a World
Series title, then dismantled much of the roster in a series of
trades. The Diamondbacks' payroll will rise from $32.8 million in
1998 to the $53 million range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing what everybody is trying to do _ compete,''
Colangelo said. ``Why is it not OK for us to do something, and it's
OK for the Yankees, or anybody else for that matter?''
</P>
<P>
   2. Atlanta: The rap sheet on the Braves the past several seasons
has been that they don't have enough hitting to complement the
majors' best starting rotation. That should change next season as
they look to remedy a string of postseason disappointments that
have resulted in only one World Series title despite seven straight
divisional crowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves traded pitcher Denny Neagle to Cincinnati in a
five-player deal that brought All-Star second baseman Bret Boone
and then signed power-hitting outfielder Brian Jordan to a $40
million contract. Those moves give Atlanta a projected lineup of
six players who had at least 24 homers and 90 RBIs in 1998. The
Braves also brought back free agent Otis Nixon, giving them a true
leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``New linen, new china, new crystal,'' said Braves GM John
Schuerholz.
</P>
<P>
   3. New York Yankees: Even when they aren't playing on the field,
the Yankees keep winning. Think 125 wins sounds impressive? At this
rate, they may never lose a game. The World Series champions will
return intact after re-signing free agents Bernie Williams, the
American League's batting champion, and third baseman Scott
Brosius, Most Valuable Player in the Yankees' World Series sweep of
San Diego. They also picked up the renegotiated option of 20-game
winner David Cone.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible New York isn't through this offseason as owner
George Steinbrenner attempts to woo five-time Cy Young Award winner
Roger Clemens to the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   4. Anaheim: The Mouse has spending power. Thanks to Disney's
commitment _ not to mention thick wallet _ the Angels signed
slugger Mo Vaughn to an $80 million, six-year contract, giving him
the highest annual salary in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim lost out in the Randy Johnson sweepstakes, but so did
division rival Texas, so the race in the AL West should remain
competitive next season. With the distracted Vaughn out of Boston,
expect him to carry his weight in his new West Coast surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   5. Cleveland: A No. 1-caliber pitcher still remains a big
priority for the Indians, but offense and defense rank a close
second and third. They took care of the latter two areas with the
$32 million signing of free-agent second baseman Roberto Alomar,
thus putting an end to the ongoing shuffle at second that has
featured 16 different players since 1996. The addition reunites
Roberto with older brother Sandy, the Tribe's starting catcher.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians did upgrade their bullpen with the acquisition of
Ricardo Rincon from Pittsburgh and might be a sleeper in the race
to land Clemens. If Clemens goes elsewhere, GM John Hart is
comfortable with his club's chances in the weak AL Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Braves have three or four No. 1 starters and haven't made
it to the World Series in either of the last two years. We've been
to the World Series in two of the last four years,'' Hart said.
``There are a lot of ways to put together a championship club.''
</P>
<P>
   Losers
</P>
<P>
   1. Boston general manager Dan Duquette: Isn't this the same guy
who said Roger Clemens was in the twilight of his career? Since the
Red Sox parted ways with the popular Clemens, the Rocket has won
two straight Cy Young Awards and shows no signs of stopping any
time soon.
</P>
<P>
   And now, with Duquette unwilling to go beyond a five-year deal
with Vaughn, the power-hitting first baseman has packed his bags
for sunny California. But hey, they caused a stir by giving a
four-year, $26 million deal to Jose Offerman _ whose 22 career
homers are 18 fewer than Vaughn hit this past season _ and agreeing
to multi-year deals with Troy O'Leary, Reggie Jefferson and Jeff
Frye.
</P>
<P>
   2. Chicago White Sox: The White Sox have a gaping hole in their
lineup after the departures of outfielder Albert Belle and third
baseman Robin Ventura, who combined for 70 homers and 243 RBIs last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Belle, who signed with Baltimore, had 49 homers and 152 RBIs in
1998 and became a free agent because a clause in his $55 million,
five-year contract allowed him to if the White Sox did not keep him
among baseball's three highest-paid players. Meanwhile, Ventura
turned down the White Sox's final offer and signed with the New
York Mets for $32 million over four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the situation the last two years, October rolls
around, and you're out there working on your golf game. That just
didn't sit well with me,'' Belle said. ``It was a situation where I
weighed all my options, and I felt Baltimore was my best option.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox, pushing a youth movement, finished 80-82 last
season after a terrible start. They were 35-51 in the first half
and 45-31 in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   3. San Diego: For now, we'll classify the defending NL champion
Padres as losers, but that can change if they are able to re-sign
pitcher Kevin Brown, which becomes less and less of a possibility
as each day passes.
</P>
<P>
   The first to go was former NL Most Valuable Player Ken Caminiti,
who got his wish and signed a free-agent deal with the Astros.
Outfielder Steve Finley appears headed to Arizona, while the
Colorado Rockies are considered the front-runners to land Brown.
</P>
<P>
   4. The $48 Million Payroll-and-Below Club: The biggest losers in
an industry gone mad for the almighty dollar are the teams on a
budget.
</P>
<P>
   How wide is the gap? Only one team with a 1998 payroll above $48
million had a losing record _ Baltimore, whose player salaries
amounted to a major league-high $74 million. Conversely, only three
teams spending less than $48 million _ San Francisco ($47.9), St.
Louis ($47.6) and Toronto ($37.3) _ managed winning records.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't good news for clubs like the Montreal Expos and
Florida Marlins. Piazza, Williams and Belle will make more than the
Expos paid their entire team last season ($8.3 million).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible,'' Expos president Claude Brochu said. ``You
have to keep in mind the Expos have by far the lowest payroll and
by far the lowest revenues, so we are just between a rock and a
hard place.''

NBA players may issue deadline
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HOUSTON _ In his continuing war with the National Basketball
Players' Association, NBA commissioner David Stern has often
alluded to his biggest weapon, the so-called ``drop-dead'' date.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the point of no return is called, the date on which
the season will be canceled because there would be not sufficient
time to get in enough games to make up a competitive season.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the inability to get a new collective bargaining
agreement with the players' union, Stern has refused to actually
set a drop-dead date.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the players, tiring of the 160-day lockout, may just tell
the NBA to drop dead this week.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Dutt, a member of the agents' advisory committee to the
players' union, said he will urge union executive director Billy
Hunter to set a drop-dead date in an effort to pressure the owners
into more serious bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come to the conclusion that maybe we need a drop-dead
date to get things done,'' said Dutt, an agent who represents
Antonio McDyess, Shawn Kemp, Nick Van Exel and Avery Johnson, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (the committee) will take the next opportunity to urge
Billy to come out and announce a drop-dead date. Instead of
operating under the owners' terms (in negotiations) all the time, I
think the union should say, `We're giving you (the owners) an
ultimatum, and here it is.' Then you set the date.''
</P>
<P>
   What would that date be? Dutt said the committee hasn't really
discussed an absolute date yet, but he thinks it shouldn't be too
difficult to arrive at one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to go back to what people are discussing as to
when you could really have a season,'' Dutt said. ``Most agree that
it's right around Christmas. You say, `OK, it's going to be Dec. 21
or 23.' That gives everyone a couple of weeks to get something
done. But at least there's something at the end of the tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's bargaining session in New York, which consisted of
almost 11 hours of face-to-face meetings, was the first in almost
two weeks. No new talks are on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference after Thursday's session, Stern was
asked about the possibility of mediation to end the stalemate, but
included talk of killing the season in his response.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was suggested that we set a deadline and cancel the season
if we don't agree by the deadline,'' Stern said. ``That's something
I find sufficiently abhorrent. An artificial deadline for the
season is useless. In our view, the season will expire of its own
weight whenever that time is.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing I'm planning to do to push that ahead to an
artificial limitation. But I now recognize the possibility, if not
the likelihood, that the season will expire.''
</P>
<P>
   The players are tiring of the constant lags in discussions,
where they often go days or even weeks between sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to do the deal, let's do it right now,'' said
Utah's Karl Malone, who attended Thursday's meeting. ``If not,
cancel it. Stop teasing the fans. Stop stringing people along. I'm
willing to sit out the whole year to get what's fair. They can take
the season away, that's commissioner Stern's call.''
</P>
<P>
   Not if the agents' advisory committee has its way.
</P>
<P>
   The committee actually talked with Hunter about setting a
drop-dead date before last Thursday's negotiating session. Hunter
decided to hold back on setting any date, but mentioned in the
post-meeting news conference that it may be time to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an issue of time,'' Hunter said. ``I think they (the
owners) are just not quite ready to make a deal. They're hoping to
take us up to the 12th hour, in hope that when we're confronted by
some kind of end time, we'll be inclined to enter an agreement that
we're not inclined to do now.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a matter of fact, we've suggested that if that's how the
scenario evolves, and each of us are going to have guns to our
heads, maybe we should set a date now for cancellation. Then we can
negotiate under that pressure in hopes of getting the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The major obstacle to getting a deal remains the timing rules
change, which would force teams that sign another team's free agent
to forfeit the right to go over the salary cap to re-sign their own
Larry Bird exception free agents. Teams have been able to go over
the cap to re-sign their own free agents, the reason the Bulls were
able to pay Michael Jordan $33 million last year despite a salary
cap of $26 million.
</P>
<P>
   The owners tried to ease the shock of the timing rules change by
offering to phase it in over a period of time, but the players have
made it known that they will not accept any changes that impact
Bird free agency. The owners, who would like to close as many cap
loopholes and exceptions as possible, are holding firm on their
demand for the timing rules change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're within striking distance, but there are pretty
significant issues that separate us right now,'' Hunter said.
``Unless they soften their stances on those issues, we're not going
to have a season.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutt agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't get a deal in two weeks, then you're not going to
have a deal in a month,'' he said. ``If you have a (drop-dead)
date, it's going to stop this, `We'll meet once a week for the next
six months,' that's been going on. Once you get to that drop-dead
date, I think the owners can't afford to lose the season. Right
now, they're dictating to us everything that's going on. Why
operate on their terms all the time?
</P>
<P>
   I feel that as much as it hurts, I would rather lose the season
than agree to what they (the owners) have on the table.
Absolutely.''

A&AMP;M stuns Kansas State, wins Big 12 championship
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JEROME SOLOMON
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The Big 12 Championship Game was supposed to be a
mere formality.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State, a two-touchdown favorite coming into Saturday's
showdown with Texas A&AMP;M, was one half away from competing for the
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   But any Wildcats fans who left the Trans World Dome early
Saturday afternoon to make reservations for Tempe will have to call
back to cancel. The Aggies did not cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Matching the school's biggest come-from-behind win ever,
10th-rated A&AMP;M rallied from a 15-point fourth-quarter deficit to
surprise No. 2 K-State 36-33 in double overtime before a loud and
mostly purple-clad crowd of 60,798.
</P>
<P>
   Much-maligned quarterback Branndon Stewart, who learned Thursday
he would get the start because of an injury to Randy McCown, threw
a 32-yard touchdown pass to Sirr Parker in the second overtime to
give A&AMP;M (11-2) the win.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats were feeling pretty good upon entering the halftime
locker room with a 17-3 lead and learning No. 3 UCLA, ranked a
notch above the Wildcats in the Bowl Championship Series ratings at
No. 2, had lost to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But the second half made it a day of redemption for Stewart, who
completed 11 of 20 passes for 235 yards and three touchdowns in the
fourth quarter and overtime periods, proved to be the undoing of
the championship hopes of Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats, who were ranked No. 1 in the ESPN/USA Today
coaches poll and No. 2 in the Associated Press writers poll, were
also trying to win their first conference championship since 1934
but fell to 11-1 with the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very evident that this is a tremendously disappointed
and hurt football team _ players, coaches, fans,'' said a solemn
Kansas State coach Bill Snyder, as several players who joined him
in the postgame news conference cried in the background. ``I have
so much pride in these players. This may be, in their young lives,
the most difficult thing that they have had up to this point in
time to handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pain that comes from this is there because there was such
an emotional investment made by all these young people, far greater
than most can ever imagine. The greater the investment, the greater
the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no such pain for Stewart and the Aggies, who had their
slim hopes of a national championship taken away by an upset loss
at the hands of Texas last week. A&AMP;M rebounded with a spirited
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't recall ever being this excited about a football game
prior to the football game,'' said Stewart, who started five games
this season. ``I felt fortunate to have the opportunity to play
again. To be honest I didn't think feel like I was going to get to
play again, because Randy was doing a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart got his chance and made the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   In the final 10 minutes of regulation, he threw two touchdown
passes and converted a game-tying two-point conversion throw. After
the teams traded field goals in the first extra period, he answered
a second Kansas State three-pointer with a quick slant to Parker,
who stiff-armed a defender before diving at the right pylon for the
winning score.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart also made it a point to jokingly apologize to his
critics in the media for not allowing them to ``copy'' prior
stories of his poor play to use for this game.
</P>
<P>
   Those stories were indeed ready to run, as Stewart struggled to
hit receivers through three quarters. The senior from Stephenville
was 4-for-11 for just 89 yards with an interception when the Aggies
found themselves in a 27-12 hole entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   His counterpart, Michael Bishop, a first-team All-Big 12 choice
from Willis, was having a stellar game. Bishop finished the day
19-for-28 passing for 341 yards and two touchdowns to go with 101
yards rushing and another score.
</P>
<P>
   But A&AMP;M's defense began the final period by forcing Kansas State
to do something it had not done the entire game _ punt.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M took over at its 22 after that kick and quickly drove 78
yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart hit his stride in the march, connecting with Chris
Taylor for 35 yards down the left sideline after Kansas State
cornerback Gerald Neasman fell down to start the drive, and hitting
Chris Cole for 14 yards, Derrick Spiller for 12 and finally Leroy
Hodge for the score from 13 yards out.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart had Spiller wide-open in the middle of the field but
drilled a pass to Hodge on the right side instead, pulling the
Aggies within a touchdown and two-point conversion at 27-19 with
9:20 to play.
</P>
<P>
   After A&AMP;M safety Rich Coady nearly recovered a fumble on the
ensuing kickoff, the Aggies defense rose to the occasion a second
consecutive time, with Roylin Bradley chasing down the elusive
Bishop from behind to force another punt.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart continued his roll, connecting with Spiller, who had all
four of his catches (for 92 yards) in the fourth quarter and
overtimes, on passes of 26 and 36 yards to move the Aggies inside
the Kansas State 20-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   But the drive stalled and ended on downs with Stewart's pass
attempt to Taylor being batted down at the line of scrimmage by
Wildcats tackle Damion McIntosh with 3:26 to play.
</P>
<P>
   It was time for the Aggies' defense, which allowed 519 yards on
the day, to step up once again. Especially since A&AMP;M had only one
timeout remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went on the field right there, we knew we needed to
make something happen,'' said linebacker Dat Nguyen, who had a
game-high 17 tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Warrick Holdman made it happen on third down.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop scrambled on the third-and-six play from his own 28 and
would have had enough yardage for the first down. But Holdman
knocked the ball free, and Cornelius Anthony recovered for A&AMP;M at
the 35.
</P>
<P>
   Following a 15-yard penalty for offensive pass interference,
Stewart worked his magic once again, hitting Matt Bumgardner, who
made a spectacular over-the-shoulder grab for a 36-yard gain to the
14.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later, Parker went in motion to the right and
slipped inside safety Jarrod Cooper for a nine-yard touchdown grab
with 1:05 on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The same combination worked on the two-point conversion attempt
to tie the game, forcing the overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop did bring a little excitement by completing a 54-yard
Hail Mary pass on the final play of regulation, but Toya Jones
tackled Everett Burnett at the one-yard line as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sick feeling,'' said Bishop afterward. ``I feel
terrible about the situation.''

NBA MAY LOSE SEASON, BUT TOO FEW REALLY CARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ With the lockout in its sixth month, 230 games
canceled, $400 million in salaries lost and the drop-dead date
approaching faster than the Y2K meltdown, the NBA is staring
nervously at the guillotine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it's gotten to this point, but you're wearing
blinders if you don't think the season is in big jeopardy,''
Mavericks guard Erick Strickland said at last night's charity
exhibition game staged at Loos Field House. ``Not that we want to,
but I think we're all making plans to beout of work a year.''
</P>
<P>
   And on that cheerful point, on to the really bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody cares.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, 4,000 fans paid between $20-$100 to watch Cedric Ceballos
score, Robert Horry dunk and a late-arriving Shaquille O'Neal sign
autographs and suck on a lollipop in a goofy maroon football
jersey, but it has become clear that the NBA is missed about as
much as Pong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame them because I'm sure it doesn't make sense to
them,'' Mavericks guard Steve Nash said. ``I just don't want them
to blame us. We'd be playing if it was our choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans aren't debating the lockout at the water cooler, and
they're not particularly lamenting the loss with their remote
controls. ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' says ratings are up this year
despite the lack of nightly 15-minute NBA highlights.
</P>
<P>
   Why? The NBA has bred entertainment fans, not necessarily
basketball fans. And those fans, occupied by football through
January, were already turned off last year with players' off-court
transgressions and the ugly on-court style of play.
</P>
<P>
   Add this lengthy, nonsensical lockout of players already making
salaries comparable to the GNP of Bangladesh, and now it's NBA:
Nothing But Apathy.
</P>
<P>
   A charity game in Miami drew only 2,200 on Friday and one in
Houston attracted 6,000 last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We miss the players, but not really the games,'' said Joe
Caton, who drove his two children to last night's game from North
Richland Hills. ``They're like movie stars, and this was a good
chance to see them. But if you want to really see good basketball,
you can watch college or even high school.''
</P>
<P>
   While players and owners continue to haggle over the ``problem''
of dividing $2 billion, fans fight the out-of-sight, out-of-mind
dilemma for a league with a future about as bleak as the holy
matrimony of Dennis Rodman and Carmen Electra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the owners, these guys are just playground players,''
said Bonnie Hyatt of Dallas, who nonetheless shelled out $40 for
her and her son to watch last night's game. ``It's not like they
don't make enough money already. They're all greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, hard-core hoop fanatics experiencing NBA
withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame because we all miss them,'' said 28-year-old fan
Jerome Hawkins of Oak Cliff. ``This is the only game we may see all
season, so we had to be here. I think everybody's sick about this,
and I don't even understand what's going on?''
</P>
<P>
   While commissioner David Stern spreads holiday doom-and-gloom by
saying ``it's more unlikely than likely that we will have a
season,'' players and fans are learning to deal with their limited
options.
</P>
<P>
   There's talk of a Dec. 19 game in Atlantic City featuring
members of all four Dream Teams and similar exhibitions in the
coming weeks in Canada and Atlanta. Between cameos, players are at
least finding productive ways to spend their spare time.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Williams is turning into Bison Dele, Chris Webber is
weaseling out of jail again, Kenny Anderson is figuring out a way
to pay the insurance on his nine cars and Latrell Sprewell is
sitting quietly at his home in Milwaukee, under 90-day house arrest
with an ankle monitor for a reckless driving conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Last night's exhibition was fan-friendly with players signing
autographs, children allowed to participate in pregame layup lines
and the absence of those pesky traveling violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't care we wouldn't be here,'' said O'Neal, who
arrived for the supposed 7:30 tip-off at exactly 7:45 and didn't
play because organizers couldn't find shorts big enough. ``We do
care, we want to play and we want the fans to know that. Games like
this help.''

MIAMI LEAVES BRUINS IN RUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ They came off the field hearing chants of ``Rose Bowl,
Rose Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   In any other season, those would be words of comfort and joy for
the UCLA Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   But not Saturday. Saturday those words shouted by a jubilant
Orange Bowl crowd were taunts.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, UCLA is going to the Rose Bowl, but more importantly and
devastatingly, the Bruins are not going to play in the Fiesta Bowl
Jan. 4 for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   That became painfully and stunningly official following Miami's
remarkable 49-45 come-from-behind victory over the No. 3 Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Bruins (10-1) lose for the first time this
season, they lost for the first time in 21 games, ending the
longest winning streak in Division 1-A.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of upsets, as Kansas State lost to Texas A&AMP;M,
36-33, in Saturday's Big 12 championship game. No. 1 Tennessee beat
Mississippi State in Saturday night's SEC title game, and will be a
Fiesta Bowl participant, but which team it will face is the
question.
</P>
<P>
   Few people gave Miami (8-3) much of a chance to beat the Bruins.
The Hurricanes were banged up and embarrassed following last week's
66-13 pounding by Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Even Miami coach Butch Davis wondered about the health and
motivation of his club following the worst loss by a Miami team
since 1944.
</P>
<P>
   But people wondered about the Bruin defense, ranked a horrible
92d (of 112 Div. 1-A schools). Was it one that could win a national
championship?
</P>
<P>
   For 10 games, the Bruins and their supporters said yes. Sure the
Bruins had survived scares against Stanford and Oregon State, but
they had managed to win.
</P>
<P>
   But the Miami game raised some red flags. First of all, it was a
makeup game, orginally scheduled to be played in September, but
postponed because of the potential threat of Hurricane Georges,
which swept through the South Florida area that weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins pondered playing the game at all, eventually agreeing
to reschedule it in December, two weeks after their regular season
was over, but knowing, with the vagaries of the BCS formula of
computer rankings and strength of schedule, they might need it.
</P>
<P>
   Now the point is moot. UCLA lost, done in by the heat and
humidity of a south Florida day, overcome by a Miami team that
conjured up the ghosts of great Miami teams of the past for the
Orange Bowl crowd of 46,819 by staging one of the most remarkable
comebacks in the long and storied history of the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Edgerrin James set a tone for the day by breaking
loose on a 45-yard run that gave the Hurricanes a quick 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   For James, it was the start of a historic afternoon as he rushed
for a career- and school-record 299 yards in 39 carries, scoring
three touchdowns, including the winner from 1 yard out with 50
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The game unfolded like a regular-season-ending game in the
Orange Bowl 14 years ago when Boston College's Doug Flutie became
an instant college football legend by throwing a Hail Mary pass
that gave BC a 47-45 win over Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Miami scored, with James running behind an offensive line that
was dominating the UCLA defense.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, behind the brilliance of quarterback Cade McNown (25 of
36, 513 yards, 5 TD passes, 1 TD running) countered with its own
offensive weapons and skills. At the half Miami held a 21-17 lead,
which was hardly secure. And when the Hurricanes went three-and-out
on the first series of the third quarter and UCLA came back and
scored three quick touchdowns to take a 38-21 lead, the Bruins
looked OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never a doubt in my mind what we were going to do,''
said Miami quarterback Scott Covington. ``We just went right at
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had nothing to lose. They had everything to lose. We left
everything we had on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly and steadily the Hurricanes came back, cutting the lead
to 38-35 on a 71-yard pass from Covington to Santana Moss with
12:34 left in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   No problem, said McNown, who took the Bruins 83 yards, in which
he ran for a 1-yard touchdown that made it 45-35. The Bruins turned
the ball over, and suddenly the momentum, like the wind, shifted
towards Miami. A 29-yard pass from Covington to Mondriel Fulcher
made it 45-42 with 6:08 left.
</P>
<P>
   Again, UCLA drove, but a fumble by Brad Melsby at the Miami 26
killed another chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes, behind James's running and Covington's spot
passes, moved into the end zone with 50 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   McNown attempted a Hail Mary into the end zone from the Miami 29
on the last play, but it didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed for them, for the seniors,'' said UCLA coach
Bob Toledo. ``Now, we're going to represent the Pac-10 in the Rose
Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   But the words were spoken without a trace of joy or pride. That
would come later. Now there was only disappointment.

Resilient Aggies play role of purple people beaters
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
By DALE ROBERTSON
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ For those wearing the color purple, and there were
throngs of them, it seemed an epiphanous one-two punch.
</P>
<P>
   Only moments after Michael Bishop, that most celebrated of
Aggies rejects, rifled a 66-yard touchdown pass off his back foot
Saturday, word spread through the Trans World Dome that Miami, a
team coming off a 53-point loss, had ruined UCLA's unbeaten season.
</P>
<P>
   A throaty rumble swiftly turned into a sustained roar once the
formal announcement was made. After 105 seasons of intercollegiate
football participation, a huge majority of them served as fodder
for football factories with far grander aspirations than theirs,
Kansas State could dare think of a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   The hated Bowl Championship Series wasn't going to be allowed to
cruelly smite them after all. Manhattan, Kansas, was six quarters
from becoming the center of the amateur football universe. Bill
Snyder's 'Cats suddenly had both a 17-3 lead on Texas A&AMP;M and a
clear path to the Big Game, the Fiesta Bowl, in Tempe on January 4.
</P>
<P>
   The ill-conceived, badly flawed, oft-criticized BCS scheme had
been vindicated, albeit in spite of itself.
</P>
<P>
   Out of chaos there would be order.
</P>
<P>
   Uh ... no, Sirr!
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, this long day's gridiron journey into night
concluded with things more muddled and messier than ever. It ended
with UCLA and Kansas State in utter despair, having been rudely
detoured from the promised desertland of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   It also ended with the Texas Aggies and their fans making
hullabaloo and ca-necking with their significant others, locked in
joyous embraces following the 36-33 double-overtime shocker they
will someday tell their grand-Aggies about, a victory that ranks as
the school's most notable in more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Or, heck, maybe ever.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, it became the Aggies' most lucrative. Sirr
Parker's deciding touchdown catch-and-run off a third-and-17 will
result in an $11.5 million windfall to the Big 12 Conference, of
which Texas A&AMP;M is now the improbable 1998 champion and only
guaranteed representative in the four-bowl BCS pecking order. They
have Sugar Bowl written all over them.
</P>
<P>
   That's $10 million more than the Alamo Bowl, where A&AMP;M appeared
destined before Saturday's cataclysmic turnaround, pays out. If the
Aggies were ecstatic beyond belief, their conference brethren with
whom they must share should be no less so, assuming K-State can
still land a second BCS spot for the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it's not likely. The Orange Bowl, where the only at-large
berth exists, would have to rebuff 9-2 Florida in order to take the
Wildcats. Instead, they may fall all the way to the Alamo in the
Aggies' stead.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA can at least find solace in an extra ``home'' date at the
Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, who is, by nature, stubborn, gruff and irrascible, was
actually reduced to tears by the shattering reversal, admitting:
``It's very evident we are tremendously disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sick feeling,'' added K-State quarterback Bishop, whose
lost fumble late in regulation gave the Aggies their opportunity to
force overtime. ``I feel terrible about the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Aggies couldn't believe their good fortune.
Gracious, how quickly the ol' worm can turn.
</P>
<P>
   Sirr Parker, overshadowed by A&AMP;M's younger backs all season,
finally earned the knighthood his name implies. Fellow afterthought
Branndon Stewart finally earned his halo. R.C. Slocum, under some
fire despite a 10-2 record going in, finally earned respect as a
coach who could find an answer for a superior opponent.
</P>
<P>
   As devastating as last week's last-second loss to Texas was _
never mind subsequently losing his starting quarterback suddenly,
three days before kickoff _ Slocum kept the Aggies composed and
confident in the face of daunting odds. After all, K-State had won
19 games in a row, among them a 48-7 rout of the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   R.C.? Stands for Real Calm, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love an opportunity to prove people wrong,'' Stewart said,
referring to prognostications that the Aggies stood a snowball's
chance in the face of the Snyder juggernaut. In reality, Stewart
proved people right. Remember, when he transferred from Tennessee,
he was supposed to be the guy to carry the Aggies to a higher
place.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he only lost the starting job _ a couple times. He
might not have played a down against Kansas State if Randy McCown
hadn't been diagnosed with a broken collarbone Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, generally at his best when pressed into duty on short
notice, took a five-sack licking but passed for 324 yards and three
touchdowns, the last of which Parker pretty much got all on his
own.
</P>
<P>
   He stiff-armed cocky K-State safety Lamar Chapman at the seven,
then somehow managed to get a tiny piece of the pylon at the goal
line, thus capping the comeback from the 27-12 deficit that A&AMP;M
found itself confronting when the fourth quarter began.
</P>
<P>
   From Sirr, to Aggies everywhere, with love.

A TASK TOO TOUGH TO TACKLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The UCLA football team let a national championship slip
through its fingers Saturday. In the biggest Bruins football game
in 31 years, the defensive backs tackled as though they were
chasing lacquered sunbathers.
</P>
<P>
   The linebackers looked like they were trying to hail a passing
cab along Ocean Drive. The secondary's pass coverage was skimpier
than any bathing garment being paraded around South Beach. And two
receivers joined a notorious south Florida fraternity when they
were mugged in broad daylight.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how many wins the third-ranked Bruins string together,
they're never going to be considered more than a novelty east of
the Rockies until they can win a game that the very provincial East
Coast sporting establishment doesn't have to stay up past midnight
to watch on television.
</P>
<P>
   Five times in this decade UCLA has crossed into the Eastern time
zone seeking victories and validation. Every time they've lost
three hours, they've gone on to lose the game.
</P>
<P>
   The really horrible thing about the Bruins' 49-45 demoralizing
loss to Miami was that the Fiesta Bowl was beckoning the Bruins
like a tropical breeze right up until the Hurricanes' final gust.
UCLA hadn't played a perfect game by any stretch of the imagination
and yet the Bruins held a 17-point lead (38-21) with 16 minutes to
play.
</P>
<P>
   If anybody was going to knock UCLA out of the national
championship game, it appeared it was going to be the Bowl
Championship Series computers. Instead, the Bruins, playing in the
Eastern time zone for the first time since embarking on their
nation-leading 20-game winning streak, did nothing to squash the
generally accepted belief on this coast that their defense is a
rumor.
</P>
<P>
   Or as one New York-based sportscaster mused before the upset got
under way at the Orange Bowl, ``Can a team that is ranked 55th in
the nation in scoring defense play for a national championship?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer: apparently not. A bona fide national championship
contender does not give up 689 yards in total offense, 231 yards of
it in the fourth quarter alone. A defense determined to silence its
critics doesn't allow Miami to complete four first downs in as many
plays on its second-to-last scoring drive or to convert a
third-and-6 at its own 46 on its game-winning drive.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this was not the first time the Bruins' defense had
teetered and tottered. Last month it let Washington run wild on it
and the month before that Stanford had passed prodigiously on it.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had to make do without one of their two senior
starters on defense when linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo re-injured
his left knee on the first play from scrimmage. He would grace the
playing field for just one down more but that's hardly an excuse
for the fact UCLA made Miami running back Edgerrin James look as
armed and dangerous and elusive as Jesse James.
</P>
<P>
   James is good enough to have notched back-to-back 1,000-yard
seasons but he shouldn't have been able to burn the Bruins for a
Big East-record 299 yards on 39 carries. The only thing that slowed
him was his own lung capacity.
</P>
<P>
   In their first 10 games the Bruins always had managed to turn
their open palm of a defense into a tight fist when nothing less
than a knockout would do. They would let runners beat them to the
outside all day, then step up and make the big play to save the
game (remember their stand on Oregon's overtime drive?).
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday Anderson and Co. fell flat. Hey, you didn't need to
be learned in the language of logarithms to recognize the law of
averages was bound to catch up with them. We just assumed it would
take a little while longer, at least another game or two.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Bruins did, too. Perhaps they had been pulling magic
out of their helmets for so long they assumed the stardust would
never run out. Maybe that's why, when Ayanbadejo stared hard at his
teammates' faces before they took the field for one final defensive
stand, he saw... nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when I (encourage them) I get a response,'' he said,
``but I just got a blank look.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was left to senior Cade McNown to scramble and try to
make something out of nothing like he does so well. He drove UCLA
26 yards in the final 50 seconds before his 29-yard pass in the end
zone with no time left eluded backup quarterback Drew Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   McNown was second to McNone in his final regular-season game as
a collegian, passing for 513 yards and five touchdowns and carrying
the football for a sixth score. The Bruins' offense would have
bailed out the defense yet again if Brian Poli-Dixon and Brad
Melsby hadn't turned over the football in the final, frantic 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Poli-Dixon was stripped at the Miami 13 and the Hurricanes drove
87 yards on their ensuing possession to draw to within 10 points.
Then, with less than two minutes left, Melsby caught a pass at the
Miami 26 and lost the ball after it appeared he already was down.
It was ruled a fumble, the Hurricanes took over and marched 74
yards in 2 minutes, 34 seconds to send UCLA crying into the night.
Quite literally.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' tears sprang from their grief over losing a shot at
the national title and from the pepper spray that was squirted into
their faces by some obnoxious Miami fan (on this day that was a
redundancy). As if the game hadn't been humbling enough, the Bruins
were stopped in their paths on their way to the locker room by fans
who had streamed down from the bleachers so they could stand there
and make choking gestures and ones far more obscene than that.
</P>
<P>
   One heckler kept screaming ``Rose Bowl'' in a tone that aimed to
turn the grandfather of all postseason games into the mother of all
insults.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins should take it as an affront, that they came all this
way just to ice the right to play on their own field on Jan. 1.
Those who are satisfied with playing in the Rose Bowl will find out
soon enough how hard it is to get to where they stood Saturday
morning.

WATSON IS FULCRUM FOR YOUNG BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Coach Steve Lavin was asked Saturday evening
what he knows about his UCLA basketball team now, six games into
the 30 games season, that he didn't know before.
</P>
<P>
   He responded with the longest silence you might ever get from
Steve Lavin. Four, five, six seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good question,'' he finally said, warming up to an
answer that covered ``intensity'' and ``selflessness'' and
``progress'' but nothing more specific.
</P>
<P>
   Let me try to help.
</P>
<P>
   What Lavin and Bruins fans know now that they didn't know then
is that the team is going to revolve around sophomore point guard
Earl Watson, and that's a good thing. I said revolve around, not
rise and fall with.
</P>
<P>
   Given the youth of the 18th ranked Bruins _ who started two
freshmen and three sophomores in their 69-66 victory over 11th
ranked Oklahoma State in the Wooden Classic at the Pond _ a
playground metaphor is in order here.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is going to be a teeter-totter _ up one game (or one
minute) and down the next. Watson is going to be the fulcrum, the
base on which it rotates.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the Bruins so far.
</P>
<P>
   In six games, they've used five different starting lineups
including Saturday's, in which guard Baron Davis took the place of
forward Matt Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   In six games, they've had eight different players in the
starting lineup, four freshmen and four sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   In six games, they've been led in scoring by four different
players and in rebounding by five.
</P>
<P>
   Add the fact they've already worn three different uniforms, and
you get the idea the only certainty about these Bruins is the
uncertainty about these Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may never know what our starting lineup is going to be,''
Lavin admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Let alone their lineup from moment to moment. Lavin substituted
so frantically Saturday, meaning to take advantage of a shallower
Oklahoma State team, the Bruins on the bench might as well have
left their warm-ups off.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of this whirlwind stood Earl Watson, the only
Bruin to start every game, playing 37 of the 40 minutes this time,
leading the team with 14 points and six assists and a reassuringly
steady hand.
</P>
<P>
   Watson won't be the player who puts the Bruins over the top this
season, if over the top is where they're headed. That could be Dan
Gadzuric or Jerome Moiso, the big freshmen who have such big
potential, or Davis, the sophomore guard who is weeks away from 100
percent in his comeback from knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But take away Watson and see what will happen. Nothing good.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it was during Watson's last, short break Saturday
that a 15-point UCLA lead became a seven point UCLA lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the 40-minute man. Coach Lavin calls him our Cal Ripken
Jr.,'' forward Travis Reed said of Watson, a six-footer from Kansas
City who was the only Bruin to play in all 33 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our leader by example, the first to practice and the last
to leave. He's our general on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, in the first couple of games this season, he was
generally out of control, seemingly trying too hard to make up for
Davis' absence. Watson committed 10 turnovers (with two assists) in
a win over San Francisco and seven turnovers (with four assists) in
the loss to No.5 Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   But in the encouraging loss to No.4 Kentucky and the wins over
Delaware State and Oklahoma State, the turnovers came down to one,
four and three and the assists went up to five, six and six.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to learn to play with my (new) teammates and be a
leader,'' Watson said of his erratic start. ``It comes naturally to
me. But I'm only a sophomore, I'm not a senior.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to all the freshmen, it's easy to forget Watson isn't
exactly a grizzled veteran.
</P>
<P>
   He's modest enough to give credit to Davis for drawing defenders
and giving Watson more chances to score. And he sets a personal
goal that sounds modest _ ``I've got to be consistent'' _ but is
vital to the team.
</P>
<P>
   He's got to keep his head while everyone around him is trying to
figure this college game out.
</P>
<P>
   It's a team of unknown quantities, but after the past three
games, Lavin should know Watson can do it.

KINGS FALL TO RED WINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ It was pretty much what one would have expected, the
championship team finding a way to win, the downtrodden team
finding a way to lose.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had their moments Saturday night, rallying from a
three-goal deficit against the two-time Stanley Cup champion
Detroit Red Wings. In the end, though, a third-period goal by
Detroit winger Tomas Holmstrom was the difference as the Kings lost
4-3 before a sellout crowd of 16,005 at the Forum that included a
very vocal minority of Wings fans.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the 11th in the last 12 games for the Kings
(6-17-3).
</P>
<P>
   The first period was the latest chapter in the Kings' ongoing
saga of suffering, the perpetually dormant power play compounding
its ineptitude by allowing a shorthanded goal to Sergei Fedorov
followed by even-strength goals 25 seconds apart by Steve Yzerman
and Brendan Shanahan. By the end of the first 20 minutes, the Kings
trailed, 3-0, and had failed to score in the first period for the
10th time in the last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   There was little reason to expect a second-period turnaround,
but 5:53 into the second, the Kings cut the deficit to 3-1 with a
goal from Yanic Perreault. For Perreault, who scored 28 goals last
season, it was his first goal since Oct.18, a span of 22 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings weren't finished, and by the end of the second period,
the score was tied 3-3, their scoring outburst equaling their
offensive production for the previous four games combined.
</P>
<P>
   At 16:18, Luc Robitaille cut the deficit to one with his
team-high 12th goal, a goal that ended the Kings' 0-for-18 drought
on the power play. The Kings scored when a Detroit lapse _ and a
beautiful behind-the-back pass from Jozef Stumpel _ resulted in a
2-on-0 for Robitaille and Glen Murray.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings tied the score with 49 seconds left in the period and
referee Blaine Angus signaled a delayed penalty on Wings defenseman
Uwe Krupp. Sean O'Donnell scored the goal, his first of the season,
from the slot off a Stumpel centering feed.
</P>
<P>
   It would be for naught. Less than three minutes into the final
period, defenseman Doug Bodger and Detroit's Kris Draper tangled
for a puck to the right of goalie Stephane Fiset. Draper landed on
top of Bodger, and the puck ended up along the left boards, chased
by Steve Duchesne and Detroit's Doug Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Brown arrived first, centering the puck to Holmstrom who was all
alone in front of the net, a defensive lapse Fiset _ who made 41
saves _ was defenseless to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pulling Fiset for an extra skater in the last minute,
the Kings could not get the equalizer.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: In response to a reporter's question, general manager
Dave Taylor said a coaching change is not being contemplated and
has not been discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident in Larry as a coach,'' Taylor said. ``We offered
Larry an extension in training camp. He really hasn't responded to
it. We're worried about trying to get the team turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is in the final year of his contract. ESPN this week
reported that there are doubts whether Robinson, in his fourth year
as the Kings' coach, wants to return.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said, ``There's always doubt, not of whether I want to
return, but there's doubt of whether they want you back. Life is
full of doubts. Life is full of surprises. I'm the type of person
who lives day to day, not year to year.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson added that he would not feel comfortable signing an
extension while the Kings are so deeply mired in a slump....
Captain Rob Blake, sidelined five weeks with a broken foot, is
scheduled to undergo an MRI on Monday, and if results are negative,
he said he is hoping to start skating Tuesday and to play as soon
as Saturday at home against Vancouver. Winger Russ Courtnall,
however, is still on crutches, probably a month from returning from
his broken ankle.

DAVIS' DIATRIBE ENOUGH TO UPSET OKLAHOMA STATE'S GOTTLIEB
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The feud between UCLA point guard Baron Davis
and Oklahoma State's Doug Gottlieb was raised to public levels
during the Bruins' 69-66 victory over Oklahoma State at the Wooden
Classic on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb was ejected from the game after receiving his second
technical foul for throwing an elbow at Davis as the first half
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The elbow, Gottlieb admitted afterward, was wrong but only
highlighted the verbal war between the point guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baron was running his mouth,'' Gottlieb said. ``He wanted to
talk trash the whole game. I don't blame him but I don't take my
hat off to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of respect for him as a player but it's a shame
he needs to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis denied saying anything to Gottlieb during the game, but
admitted he was upset by comments that were relayed to him from
Gottlieb's father, Bob, a former coach at Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was saying Doug was better than me and Earl (Watson),''
Davis said. ``He said Doug was going to destroy me.''
</P>
<P>
   For Doug Gottlieb, the ejection ruined his homecoming at the
Pond. He went to high school at Tustin and had his family at the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst feeling in the whole world,'' he said. ``I
didn't think I deserved the (technical). Baron had been talking to
me the whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   Home away from home: UCLA forward Travis Reed had fond memories
of the Pond, where he played for A.B. Miller High School against
Long Beach Poly in the Southern Section Division I-AA championship
game two years ago and scored 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   He responded with one of his better games Saturday, with 12
points and five rebounds against Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the Pond. The Pond is like a second home,'' Reed said.
``I wish we played all our games here. I'd be automatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Perfect in Wooden: UCLA is 4-0 in the Wooden Classic, with three
victories against teams (Kentucky, New Mexico, Oklahoma State) that
were ranked higher than the Bruins. The only lower-ranked team to
play the Bruins was Maryland.

PAGE GOES TO MAT TO BEAT LOPEZ

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY _ Jose Luis Lopez is a bull, and bulls die hard in
the ring. But they die all the same.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night at the Atlantic City Convention Center, Lopez
died harder than most, twice knocking down World Boxing Association
welterweight champion James Page before losing a 12-round decision.
</P>
<P>
   Page actually hit the canvas six times, but four were slips on
the wet canvas and a fifth should have been but referee Tony Perez
called it a knockdown in the ninth round. To her credit, judge
Debra Barnes ignored the conventional requirement that a knockdown
result in a 10-8 round, but the other two judges did not. In the
end it didn't matter, because Page won a unanimous decision, with
Barnes giving him a 116-111 nod, while Guillermo Perez had it
115-112 and judge Cesar Ramos scored it 115-111. The Globe had Page
a 115-113 winner.
</P>
<P>
   Page started fast, his superior hand speed allowing him to beat
Lopez to the punch with a long jab and a right hand behind it.
Those punches repeatedly landed on the bridge of Lopez's nose.
</P>
<P>
   But in the third round, Lopez (42-4-2) showed what has made him
one of the most dangerous welterweights in the world when he landed
a counter right to the face of an off-balance Page and floored him.
When Page (23-3) got up, he was still in trouble, and Lopez
continued to pound him until the champion staggered back to his
corner in a fog at the bell.
</P>
<P>
   Still in trouble when the fourth round opened, Page kept
blinking as if peering into a foggy night, but by the end of the
round he was rallying and Lopez was again on the defensive. Lopez
stayed there until the fifth round, when he again hurt Page with a
straight right when the champion pulled out of a close exchange
with his right hand down while moving backward.
</P>
<P>
   Those mistakes were nearly fatal because Lopez leaped on them
and stunned Page with another right and the champion went limp. But
Lopez was unable to finish his work before the round ended.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the fight followed that pattern, with the champion
controlling long stretches with his jab and speed and some stinging
right hands that would have sent many a man out on his shield.
</P>
<P>
   But Lopez never buckled, despite taking severe abuse as his head
was repeatedly rocked straight back. But it was as if Page had
spent 12 rounds punching in vain for all the lasting damage it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt how strong he was when I hit him,'' Page said. ``I
thought he would at least bobble, but he never budged. I was trying
to stay focused and keep my jab going. He's a great fighter, but I
won the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   From time to time Lopez would stagger Page with powerful rights,
bloodying the champ's lip late in the fight and appearing twice to
have him out on his feet. After those brief explosions, Lopez would
mysteriously follow Page around, getting peppered in the process as
the champion build up his lead.
</P>
<P>
   At those times, the champion seemed to have Lopez baffled, and
in the end those long dry spells cost Lopez his second shot at the
WBA title because while he won his rounds in spectacular fashion he
lost more of them in silent fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good fight. Page deserved to win,'' Lopez said.
``Tonight I was just a bit off.''
</P>
<P>
   So was former two-time junior bantamweight champion Johnny Tapia
(45-0-2), but he managed to win a majority decision to take the WBA
bantamweight championship away from Nana Konadu (39-4-1). Judge
Uriel Aguilera scored it 116-111 and John Poturaj had it 115-112,
while judge Franco Priami saw it as a 114-114 draw.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 rounds the fighters mostly looked fiercely at one
another, although Konadu did cut Tapia's right eye in the third
round. Tapia won the last two rounds with some furious flurries
which, had they come earlier and more often, might have made things
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the evening, Richard Hall won the ``interim'' WBA
light heavyweight title that Roy Jones Jr. successfully defended
three weeks ago at Foxwoods.
</P>
<P>
   Hall (23-1, 22 KOs) stopped Anthony Bigeni (19-5) at 1:49 of the
third round, a decision made by referee Rudy Battle one second
after Bigeni landed one of the few punches he put on target in the
fight.

KINGS FALL TO RED WINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details)

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ A rarely-evident atmosphere enveloped the
Los Angeles Kings' locker room after the second period Saturday
night, exactly what one would expect from a struggling team that
had overcome a three-goal deficit to draw even with the two-time
defending champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was life,'' winger Glen Murray said later. ``Finally.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the game, the atmosphere was back to its deathly norm,
after Tomas Holmstrom's goal early in the third period lifted the
Detroit Red Wings to a 4-3 victory before a sellout crowd of 16,005
at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Holmstrom scored when left alone in front of the net by Kings
defenseman Steve Duchesne, who had chased the puck to the boards
even though his partner, Doug Bodger, was tangled on the ice with
Detroit's Kris Draper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cardinal sin for a defenseman,'' coach Larry Robinson
said of Duchesne's play. ``Some mistakes are from wanting to do too
much. Others, you learn as a pee-wee growing up. When your partner
is in trouble, as a defenseman, you stay in front of the net.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus did the Kings (6-17-3) lose for the 11th time in their last
12 games, though it wasn't as easy for Detroit (14-9-1) as it first
appeared it would be.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings grabbed a 3-0 lead after one period, the Kings'
defensive miscues contributing to goals by Sergei Fedorov
(shorthanded), Steve Yzerman and Brendan Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, however, rallied to tie in the second period, scoring
as many goals in a 13:18 span as they'd scored in their previous
four games combined. Yanic Perreault's first goal since Oct.18, Luc
Robitaille's power-play goal (snapping an 0-for-18 drought with the
man advantage) and Sean O'Donnell's first goal of the season
brought the Kings even.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' Robinson said of the atmosphere after the
second period. ``It was wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   But not for long, thanks to Holmstrom, who scored after a
centering pass from Doug Brown, who had beaten the ill-positioned
Duchesne to the puck. The Kings didn't come close to tying the
score in the game's final minutes, and were left to stew over their
latest mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys in here have to face the fact that we're losing
and if they don't bring more to the table, things are going to
change,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   A coaching change, however, does not appear to be imminent, even
though the Kings have the fewest points of any of the NHL's 27
teams. In response to a reporter's question, general manager Dave
Taylor said a change is not being contemplated and has not been
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident in Larry as a coach,'' Taylor said. ``We offered
Larry an extension in training camp. He really hasn't responded to
it. We're worried about trying to get the team turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a finalist for coach of the year honors last season,
is in the final year of his contract. ESPN this week reported that
there are doubts whether Robinson, in his fourth year as the Kings'
coach, wants to return.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said, ``There's always doubt, not of whether I want to
return, but there's doubt of whether they want you back. Life is
full of doubts. Life is full of surprises. I'm the type of person
who lives day to day, not year to year.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson added that he would not feel comfortable signing an
extension while the Kings are so deeply mired in a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Kings notes: Captain Rob Blake, sidelined five weeks with a
broken foot, is scheduled to undergo an MRI on Monday. If results
are negative, Blake said he is hoping to start skating Tuesday and
to play as soon as Saturday at home against Vancouver. Winger Russ
Courtnall, however, is still on crutches, probably a month from
returning from his broken ankle.

UPSETS ASSIST TCU'S HOPES FOR SUN BOWL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TCU's chances of playing in the Dec. 31 Sun Bowl were boosted by
UCLA's loss at Miami, Fla., and Texas A&AMP;M's upset of Kansas State
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at this point, it's in our best interest to have a
Texas team,'' said John Folmer, chairman of the Sun Bowl selection
committee. ``And there are a lot of TCU people here, as we found
out from all the letters and faxes.''
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly qualified that seeming endorsement of TCU, saying
``nothing is sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs' chief competition for a trip to El Paso
appears to be Central Florida. However, Central Florida, which
appeared to lose a spot in one of the two Hawaii bowls with UCLA's
loss, might have regained that berth thanks to A&AMP;M's victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Bowl has a contract to match teams from the Pac-10 and
Big Ten conferences. Here's how yesterday's results effected TCU:
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's loss opened a spot in the Bowl Championship Series for
Ohio State. The Big Ten Conference has only five bowl-eligible
teams but can't fill all them, opening a berth in the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's loss sends the Bruins to the Rose Bowl and moves the
Pac-10's five bowl teams down a notch. That means that the Oahu
Bowl, which also has an agreement with the Pac-10, gets a Pac-10
team, probably Southern Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M's victory means the Aggies get a spot in a BCS bowl,
probably the Orange. Kansas State is likely to get an at-large BCS
bid, probably in the Sugar. The Big 12 has seven bowl-eligible
teams and five other bowl spots.
</P>
<P>
   That means Colorado, instead of filling an at-large berth in the
Aloha Bowl, moves into one of the Big 12's bowl spots, probably the
Insight.com. That leaves an opening in the Aloha that could go to
Central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to think,'' TCU coach Dennis Franchione
said. ``I thought we were supposed to be cheering for UCLA; now I
don't know. We're just excited to be in this position and hope that
holds true.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Bowl's 11-person selection committee plans to meet at 9
a.m today to select a team to play against a Pacific-10 Conference
team, most likely Oregon, which is 8-3 and ranked 21st in The
Associated Press media poll. The committee's choice is expected to
be announced later today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had someone say: `I guess this means that Central Florida is
the favorite.' Not at all,'' Folmer said. ``Just because they're
9-2 doesn't mean they are the favorite.''

RANGERS LIKELY TO OFFER MATEO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Center fielder Ruben Mateo, the No. 1
prospect in the Rangers' minor-league system, likely will be the
centerpiece in any Texas trade proposal for Toronto right-hander
Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said yesterday that the
inclusion of catcher Ivan Rodriguez or left fielder Rusty Greer in
any trade proposal is ``very unlikely,'' leaving Mateo as the
likely core to any offer. Nevertheless, Melvin foresees the Rangers
being able to make a competitive offer for the five-time Cy Young
Award recipient.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo, a 20-year-old outfielder from the Dominican Republic, hit
.309 with 18 home runs and 75 runs batted in and stole 18 bases in
107 games this year for Double-A Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we didn't trade Ruben Mateo last summer, and we
won't,'' Rangers owner Tom Hicks said Tuesday after the Rangers
announced their acquisition of first baseman Rafael Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, though, made that statement before Clemens demanded to be
traded. Clemens, who resides in the Houston suburb of Katy,
informed the Blue Jays on Wednesday of his desire to be traded to
an organization closer to his home or to a playoff contender.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers inquired about acquiring Clemens before the July
trade deadline, but nothing materialized. Melvin and Blue Jays
general manager Gord Ash then discussed a trade that would have
sent Clemens to the Rangers in exchange for Greer, Mateo and
left-hander Darren Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is without a doubt the best Double-A player I saw this
year,'' said one American League scout who saw Mateo play numerous
times this past season. ``He's a five-tool player. He's going to
hit for average, and he's going to hit for power.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can run. He can throw. He's got great range. He can play
shallow and go get the ball. He can cut the ball off in the gap and
make the throw. He's just an exciting guy to watch.''
Orioles sign Clark
First baseman Will Clark signed a two-year, $11 million contract
with Baltimore yesterday, meaning the Rangers will receive two
draft selections as compensation for losing the free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, as it stands now, will receive the Orioles'
third-round selection and a sandwich pick between the first and
second rounds for losing Clark. The Chicago White Sox and Seattle
Mariners, as it stands now, will receive the Orioles' first- and
second-round selections, respectively, for losing left fielder
Albert Belle and right-hander Mike Timlin to Baltimore through free
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 34, could earn as much as $12.8 million with the Orioles
through incentives. He received a $1 million signing bonus with
base salaries of $4.5 and $5.5 million the next two seasons. He
also will earn bonuses of $200,000 for 115 and 120 games played and
$250,000 for 130 and 140 games played each of the next two seasons.

ILLEGAL SPORTS BETTING THRIVES AS BOOKIES HAVE LITTLE FEAR OF LAW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``B.H.'' is a lot like you and me.
</P>
<P>
   Lives in a tranquil Tarrant County neighborhood. Has an adoring
wife of 18 years, a 17-year-old son, a '91 Ford truck and passions
for sports and cold, hard, cash. He smokes too much, swears like a
sailor, is uncomfortable in ties, gives what he can to charity and
relishes his time on the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   But look closer _ where few are offered a view _ and B.H. is
nothing like you and me.
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of us were casually watching the Minnesota
Vikings-Green Bay Packers ``Monday Night Football'' game on Oct. 5,
he propped up his feet, popped open a cold one and illegally made
$17,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some people live ``for'' sports; others live ``on'' sports. You
betcha, B.H. is a big-time bookie, an independent member of a
thriving local underworld fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not claiming to be a saint by any means,'' he said
recently in the kitchen of his sneakily modest house. ``But I'm
making an honest living. Like it or not, I'm a public servant.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials disagree, but say they are handcuffed
by financial and manpower limitations to curtail neighborhood
high-stakes bookies who often take in as much as $50,000 a weekend
in bets on sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's safe to say it's pretty prevalent around our
area,'' said Steve Vega, Fort Worth Police Department vice division
officer, who nonetheless indicated his department had not made a
gambling arrest in the past year. ``We really don't have the
resources to make a commitment to shutting it down.''
</P>
<P>
   From $5 bets at the corner bar, to $500 wagers on Cowboys games,
to the point shaving scandal that has invaded the football and
basketball programs at Northwestern University, sports gambling _
legal and illegal _ has ballooned into a $100 billion industry that
authorities find difficult to harass, much less to harness.
</P>
<P>
   Final score: Bookies $$$, Arrests 0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plain and simple, it's just very hard to stop,'' said Ray Rike
of the Tarrant County District Attorney's office. ``We know it
exists _ there are bets made at every level on practically every
corner _ but we can't afford to go out and set up sting operations
to catch every bookie.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither does B.H. seem to need gadgets to attract customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see me advertising, do you?'' B.H. said. ``People
come to me because they want to, not because I beg or entice them.
The Texas Lottery doesn't give a damn if it's a family down to its
last $20, they'll take it and not even know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a businessman, but I've also got a heart. I won't let
people destroy themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't stop people from placing bets with bookies such as
B.H. In a recent study, the Texas Council on Problem and Compulsive
Gambling (TCPCG) estimated that 45 percent of Texans gambled on an
activity other than the lottery last year, and 34 percent placed a
sports bet with a friend or a bookie.
</P>
<P>
   Says B.H., ``If you don't bet, chances are you know a friend of
a friend who does.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't smirk. Your repair man, fast-food delivery boy, or even
your judge could be gambling on sports right under your naive nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howdy, Joe Bob. I'll take some milk, bread, a bag of those
pork rinds, and give me TCU plus the points for $25.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the Fort Worth-Dallas area on weekends, tens of thousands
of bettors phone-in illegal wagers ranging from $25 to $10,000 in
an attempt to predict the final score of football games. The
Cowboys, for example, are favored today over New Orleans by 6 1/2
points, referred to as the ``point spread.'' If the underdog Saints
win the game outright or lose by fewer than 6 1/2 points, those
betting on them will win and those betting on Dallas will lose.
</P>
<P>
   Bets also are commonly made on the total points scored in the
game, known as the over-under, and on multiple-game packages,
called ``parlays.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most estimates say $100 billion is bet legally and illegally
on sports each year,'' said John Avello, director of Bally's Sports
Book in Las Vegas. who ranks football ahead of basketball and then
baseball in volume. ``That's a pretty healthy industry.''
</P>
<P>
   With a backdrop of phones ringing in makeshift offices, payoffs
exchanged in restaurant parking lots and losers anguishing through
sleepless nights, a close-up look at the ever-growing industry of
illegal sports gambling from bookie, to bettor, and beyond: WHO'S
BOOKING? For every 40-ish B.H., who has owned what he calls a
``store'' for 23 years, there are thousands of fly-by-night,
20-something bookies who disappear owing a couple hundred bucks
here and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like any other profession, reputation is everything,''
said ``Goldie,'' a bookmaker in south Dallas who claims to stash as
much as $200,000 cash under his fish aquarium and to have 75
regular players, including a Tarrant County Junior College freshman
and a high-level executive at a major area business. ``There are
bookies who are in it to get rich quick, to steal your money.
Believe me, we hate them as much as anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   B.H. said he has been a professional gambler since his
grandfather taught him to pitch pennies at age 7. Watching the
Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs, a minor-league baseball team, at Turnpike
Stadium as a teen-ager in the late 1960s, he stumbled upon a gold
mine. After witnessing a pass-the-hat ``Guess Tonight's
Attendance'' game flourish, B.H. decided to take it a step further.
</P>
<P>
   After trolling each section and soliciting around 200 guesses at
$1 each, B.H. later found the patron with the closest guess and
awarded the winner's pot _ of $100.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the money, it was the right to stand up and brag
about how smart they were,'' said B.H., who pocketed the other $100
without a single inquiry. ``That's called running the numbers. The
mob did it. Today, the lotteries do it. You may be thrilled to win
$40 million, but what if they took in $50 million?''
</P>
<P>
   Like the lottery, B.H. assumes a position that practically
guarantees a profit. That position includes collecting a ``vig or
``juice,'' a 10 percent fee on losing bets that keeps bookies in
business and most bettors in the red.
</P>
<P>
   ``My lifeblood,'' says B.H. ``It's not that you can't beat me,''
B.H. said, grinning. ``It's that you can't beat the odds.
Eventually, they'll catch up to you. The only guys who have a
chance are the ones who only play big on one or two games here and
there. But they eventually lose, too.''
</P>
<P>
   B.H. knows the ups and downs of gambling _ he said he once won
an acre of land near Lake Whitney in a poker game, another time
sank a 10-foot par putt worth $64,000, lost $57,000 on Super Bowl
XXVI and routinely takes $5 bets on horse races from his
76-year-old mother. Despite the success, he isn't pushing his son
to enter the family business. He points more toward his two
siblings, who hold more socially acceptable jobs as a machinist and
an engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ashamed at all of what he does,'' said B.H.'s son, who
plans to attend college to become a math teacher. ``If my friends
say this or that, I just tell them how ignorant they are. He's
making a good life for me, better than the one he had.''
</P>
<P>
   B.H. said he owns only one credit card, for hotel reservations
only, carries a wad of $100s the size of the Taco Bell Chihuahua,
takes expensive weekend trips to Las Vegas, recently donated money
to help build a local high school baseball field, and last wore a
suit to a family funeral in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're good-hearted, old-fashioned dinosaurs,'' said his wife,
pouring B.H. a beer-and-tomato-juice concoction as his ``store''
employees are swarmed with a combined $10,000 action on the
Syracuse-Boston College football game and Game 2 of the National
League Championship Series. ``He's got the gift of knowing numbers,
and having a big heart.'' WHO'S BETTING? Cultivating consistent
clientele is never a problem for B.H., who says he turns away as
many as 10 prospective players a month to keep his number around
130. Nowadays, it's word-of-mouth that lead bettors his way.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, it was more sleight of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Needing to build a base of customers, B.H. hatched a simple
scheme in which he mailed 10,000 local letters to names he acquired
from the Las Vegas Business and Tourist Department. In half the
letters he predicted the Cowboys to cover the point spread. In the
other half, he predicted Washington would cover. Down to 5,000 the
next week, he again used the ploy on the next Cowboys game. Two
weeks later, B.H.'s system rewarded him with 1,250 bettors to whom
he had given _ free of charge _ three consecutive weeks of
point-spread winners on Cowboys games.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he built a ``bettor'' mousetrap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could've charged them $500 a month for my picks at that
point,'' he laughs, ``but it was only something like $75. Bettors
are gullible people, always looking for a shortcut. They don't
realize it's luck, pure and simple luck.''
</P>
<P>
   That same naivete led bettors to follow B.H.'s East Coast tout
phone service during the 1991 NCAA basketball tournament. And who
could blame them? After all, the $10-a-call recorded messages
picked winners 86 percent of the time during the month-long event.
</P>
<P>
   So what if he let his dog, ``Tippy,'' do the selecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hold up two pieces of paper with the two teams and he'd
bark at one,'' B.H. said. ``Damnedest thing I've ever seen. People
call those experts like crazy, but I can tell you from experience
that they're having smoke blown up their \Rbehinds\S. It's the
biggest waste of money on earth. If those guys really went 9-1
every weekend, why would they need some piddly telephone
business?''
</P>
<P>
   Added Goldie, ``We're here to sell a product, the opportunity to
make money. It's speculation, just like the stock market. It's very
appealing. Has been for centuries. Those who study and work hard
are better than others, but the next expert to come along will be
the first. If the coaches themselves aren't sure what's going to
happen, how can some slick-talking guy in an expensive suit be
sure?''
</P>
<P>
   So who are these bettors, flooding 1-900 numbers to hear
prognosticator Johnny DeMarco yell ``I am on fiiiire!'' even though
no such person even exists? Making nightly calls to wager their
hard-earned money on a bounce of the ball here or an blown coin
flip there? And using places like local sports bars and night clubs
as weekly drop-off points for envelopes containing as much as
$12,000 in cash?
</P>
<P>
   According to Gamblers Anonymous and the Texas Council on Problem
and Compulsive Gambling (TCPCG), they are predominantly young white
males from above-average income households.
</P>
<P>
   For local bookies B.H. and Goldie, Fort Worth/Dallas is a
betting hotbed because of what they call ``homers,'' fans who bet
on the Cowboys with their hearts instead of their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the \Rpoint spread\S in Vegas and then here,'' said
B.H., who tries to manipulate the line to persuade the same amount
of money to be bet on both teams so he can profit from the 10
percent juice regardless of the outcome. ``It'll always be 1 to 2
1/2 points more expensive on Dallas. I'm a Cowboys fan, but when
they don't cover on Sunday, I usually have a happy Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Those with a severe gambling problem usually have a less happy
Monday. According to the TCPCG, approximately 500,000 Texans are
spinning out of control chasing the elusive sure thing. ``Bob'' is
among them.
</P>
<P>
   What started out as social activity in his UT-Arlington
fraternity grew into a $1,000-a-day habit that cost him his job,
his family and, almost, his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won $5,000 one week, then eight days later had to steal from
my wife's family to pay off my debt. When I won I felt invincible.
But the lows were so much more drastic. I quit caring about things
like sleeping or eating. It's just like a powerful drug. You get
addicted to the rush.''
WHO'S BOTHERING? While neither Goldie nor B.H. admits to ever
physically harassing slow payers or no-payers _ ``There's a judge
who owes me so much he just finally put me in his will,'' jokes
B.H. _ both have their tricks to avoiding legal trouble.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Goldie said he has changed his phone numbers twice a
month, answered his phone ``Whataburger'' or ``Taco Bell'' and kept
records on rice paper, easily dissolved when flushed down a toilet.
To avoid Internal Revenue Service red-flagging, B.H. said he owns
several tax-paying businesses like an air-conditioner repair shop
and a delivery service. Nosy neighbors, he said, are kept quiet
with a surprise supply of firewood at their doorstep or an
impromptu painting of their house.
</P>
<P>
   While the FBI and IRS do have units assigned to monitor
organized crime and gambling in Fort Worth-Dallas, bookies have,
for the most part, avoided the long arm of local law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very rare that we prosecute a sports gambling
case,'' said Robert Hester, chief of the Tarrant County District
Attorney's intake division. ``The police just don't bring us
anything. In fact, I don't remember any in the last several
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Vega indicated the crackdowns were tougher and the arrests more
frequent in Dallas. He says each of the dozen Fort Worth gambling
arrests made in the past 12 months were for cockfighting and video
slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``To really catch bookies you have to get a foothold in their
network, and that takes time and money,'' Vega said. ``They run in
their own circles and are basically tight-lipped. It seemed like we
were spinning our wheels, spending $2,000 and a couple months' work
to get a guy on two years' probation.''
</P>
<P>
   B.H. only smiles when asked about his annual income and laughs.
He said his self-employed salary is ``unpredictable'' and his store
is ``profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   He does brag about having carte blanche in some of Fort Worth's
finest restaurants and on some of its best golf courses, where he
routinely +accessorizes his 14-club bag with a gun, ``just in
case.'' During a recent round, he said he paused from a birdie putt
long enough to introduce his foursome to a fellow bookie permitted
to play barefoot because of ``friendly connections'' with the club
pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sleep great at night,'' B.H. said. ``I don't owe anyone a
dollar I can't pay right here on the spot, and I got most
everything I need. As for the victims, show them to me. I consider
my players as business associates, and I've even become friends
with some of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bookies knowingly break the law, but say they prefer to remain
illegal eagles. Unlike proponents for prostitution or marijuana,
they aren't pushing to make their product legal, in part because
they would be forced to pay taxes on their income.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one reason it can't be legalized, but it's a good
one,'' B.H. said. ``If it were, we could never really trust the
athletes not to bet against themselves. It would ruin sports, and
sports is what it's really all about. Nobody knows what going to
happen in games, but the temptation is to thinking you do.''
</P>
<P>
   In case you run out of luck and money, at least you can take
that advice to the bank.

   Gamblers Anonymous is an organization designed to help
compulsive gamblers stop gambling. There are two locations and
three meetings in the Fort Worth-Dallas area _ two at 7 p.m. in
Dallas on Tuesday and Thursday night _ and one in North Richland
Hills on Thursday nights at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Gamanon is an organization for people who are affected by
gambling but don't gamble, the GA equivalent of Alcohol Anonymous'
Alanon. The Gamanon usually includes spouses, parents, children and
friends. The meetings are at the same time, places and nights as
the Gamblers Anonymous meetings, but in a different room. There is
also a mixed meeting involving both groups in Dallas on Saturday
mornings at 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Membership at the meetings, which include from seven to 20
members, requires only a desire to quit gambling. ``People just
want to take two aspirins and be cured by morning, but it isn't
quite that easy,'' says Herb E. of the Dallas branch. GA has 20
questions that it asks new members. Compulsive gamblers usually
answer ``yes'' to at least seven.
</P>
<P>
   1. Do you lose time from work due to gambling?
</P>
<P>
   2. Does gambling make your home life unhappy?
</P>
<P>
   3. Does gambling affect your reputation?
</P>
<P>
   4. Do you ever feel remorse after gambling?
</P>
<P>
   5. Do you ever gamble to get money with which to pay debts or to
otherwise solve financial difficulties?
</P>
<P>
   6. Does gambling cause a decrease in your ambition or
efficiency?
</P>
<P>
   7. After losing, do you feel you must return as soon as possible
to win back your losses?
</P>
<P>
   8. After a win, do you have a strong urge to return and win
more?
</P>
<P>
   9. Do you often gamble until your last dollar is gone?
</P>
<P>
   10. Do you ever borrow to finance your gambling?
</P>
<P>
   11. Do you ever sell anything to finance gambling?
</P>
<P>
   12. Are you reluctant to use ``gambling money'' for normal
expenditures?
</P>
<P>
   13. Does gambling make you careless about the welfare of your
family?
</P>
<P>
   14. Do you ever gamble longer than you planned?
</P>
<P>
   15. Do you ever gamble to escape worry or trouble?
</P>
<P>
   16. Do you ever commit, or consider committing, an illegal act
to finance your gambling?
</P>
<P>
   17. Does gambling cause you to have difficulty sleeping?
</P>
<P>
   18. Do arguments, disappointments, or frustrations create within
you an urge to gamble?
</P>
<P>
   19. Do you have an urge to celebrate good fortune by a few hours
of gambling?
</P>
<P>
   20. Do you ever consider self-destruction as a result of your
gambling?
</P>
<P>

TERMS OF ENDANGERMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
A look at some of the most commonly used terms and phrases by
bookies and bettors:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bookie: Person who accepts multiple bets from multiple people on
sporting events. Also called ``Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Store: Office _ sometimes home garages or even rented warehouses
_ in which bookies set up phones and operations.
</P>
<P>
   Player: Person who makes bets with bookies on sporting events.
Depending on outcome, he will either pay or be paid by bookie.
</P>
<P>
   Line: Number selected by bookie to entice half his players to
bet on one team and half on the other. Also called ``Point
spread,'' or ``Number,'' it is the key to establishing each game as
a money-making proposition for bookies.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite: Team that the betting public thinks will win the game.
The bookie makes his line based on public perception. For example,
the Cowboys were an 8-point favorite against the Giants on Nov. 8.
Since they won by 10, 16-6, those betting on Dallas won and those
on New York lost.
</P>
<P>
   Underdog: Team that the betting public thinks will lose the
game. Backers of these teams can ``win'' if losing by a total less
than the point spread. For example, Stanford lost to UCLA, 28-24.
However, since Stanford was an 18-point underdog and only lost by
four, the Stanford backers were winners in betting terms.
</P>
<P>
   Credit: Given to bettors at start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Settle: Discreet, cash-only transactions from either
bookie-to-player or vice-versa. Most of these occur in public
places.
</P>
<P>
   Action: Used by bookie or player to describe volume of betting
on a certain game. For example, a typical Cowboys game draws
approximately $15,000 worth of action to some stores.
</P>
<P>
   Juice: The 10-percent tax by the bookies on all losing wagers.
Most bookies charge bettors $11 for every $10 they risk. For
example, a player winning a $50 bet would win $50, but a loser
would lose $55. Also called ``Vigorish'' or ``Vig,'' it might not
seem like much. But if a bookie can take $10,000 action on one team
and also $10,000 on the other, he's guaranteed to make $1,000 in
juice no matter the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Totals: A bet on how many points will be scored in a game.
Bookies establish the number and players bet either over or under
the total.
</P>
<P>
   Parlay: Multiple-game bet in which the player tried to correctly
predict two or more games to increase his odds. For example, a
player winning a three-game parlay gets paid 6-to-1 ($300 on a $50
bet) for getting all three games right. He must get all three games
right, but there is no juice on parlays.
</P>
<P>
   Push: Used to describe tie bets. For example, if the Cowboys
were favored over the Giants by 8 and had won, 24-16, it would have
been a push. No money exchanges hands on pushes.
</P>
<P>
   Limit: Pre-determined amount established between bookie and
player on a particular game.
</P>
<P>
   Homer: Player who typically bets on one team regardless of the
point spread. Dallas is known as a hotbed of homers because of the
rabid loyalty to the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Solid: Player who has established a good reputation with his
bookie for paying his balance on time.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit: Player who is attempting to not pay his amount due the
bookie. They often attempt to avoid the bookies by changing their
phone numbers or even addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Expert: Person who claims to be able to correctly predict
outcomes of sporting events, especially football games. Also called
``Touts,'' they charge for giving out information on a recorded
message.

YOU BET YOUR LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The writer is a 48-year-old compulsive gambler in recovery,
who has worked in the communications field since he was 18. He
gambled from the time he was 20 until he was 40, stopping Dec. 8,
1990. Because he's a member of Gamblers Anonymous, his name cannot
be used.''
</P>
<P>
   There are mornings I wake up and think about making a bet.
</P>
<P>
   They're usually days when there's a big game _ a Super Bowl or
Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   And then I think about a few other things.
</P>
<P>
   I think about how much money I lost, making bets on ``sure
things.''
</P>
<P>
   I think about eight years ago, when I turned 40, and had no
savings, no possessions that were truly mine.
</P>
<P>
   I think about the look of terror and defeat on my wife's face
when she discovered by accident that ``we'' were more than four
years' salary in debt.
</P>
<P>
   I think about two friends who committed suicide, and several
others who could have died if fate hadn't intervened.
</P>
<P>
   I think about my father turning his back on me and sadly saying
eight years ago, ``I love you, but I've never respected you.''
</P>
<P>
   And I go another day without making that bet.
</P>
<P>
   I lied, broke laws and nearly drove my wife into a nervous
breakdown. I've hurt those who are close to me, financially and
emotionally. I've been awake at 5 a.m., my heart thumping, because
I knew I couldn't pay the bookie or the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two, the bookie was always more important. Because not
paying him meant I couldn't continue to bet.
</P>
<P>
   And that was unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   I'd wake up in the morning after losing several thousand dollars
the night before and swear to myself I'd never do it again. Then,
that afternoon, I'd make 20 or 30 more bets, knowing that I'd be on
the road to getting even.
</P>
<P>
   After the first couple of years, I wanted to stop, or at least
frequently told myself I wanted to. But I was unable to. Denial was
one reason, although there were other factors.
</P>
<P>
   If I were an alcoholic or a drug addict, my addiction would have
become obvious to the people close to me because of physical
reasons, if nothing else. But a compulsive gambler rarely shows any
physical effects, other than a lack of sleep or shortness of
temper.
</P>
<P>
   As with most addictions, however, accessibility and availability
creates the potential for problems. As I got older I had more
spending money.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 15 years, I went on a progressive downhill slide.
In my early 20s, I was making two or three bets a week, usually for
about $25 to $50.
</P>
<P>
   When we were living in San Francisco and the earthquake hit in
1989, the first thing I worried about was my wife. Second _ and it
was only minutes later _ I worried about the major bet I had on the
World Series, wondering if the games would be played. I didn't care
about the people who had suffered. My bet was my concern.
Truthfully, if the earthquake had happened a year later, my wife
would ``not'' have been my first concern.
</P>
<P>
   Then, about two years later, I got caught.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, in December 1990, I was betting every game on the
board. At that point, the bets ranged from $5 to thousands of
dollars. The action was what mattered, not the cost.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I went on vacation, and when we returned, she found
the bills I was usually able to hide. She started to call the
police, thinking that somebody had stolen our credit cards. When I
confessed, she broke down.
</P>
<P>
   She told me that she was probably going to divorce me and
possibly turn me into the police. She said she would ``definitely''
do that if I didn't start going to Gamblers Anonymous meetings. She
was determined to save herself, but wanted me to save myself as
well.
</P>
<P>
   With those threats hanging over my head, I attended my first
meeting. I was tired of the gambling, weary of the lying, depressed
by the losses. So for me, an alternative was welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, eight years later, it's a different life. The bills are
paid, the emotional fences are mended, we even bought a house a
year ago. I attend meetings at least once a week, which sometimes
is difficult since there are just three meetings in the entire Fort
Worth-Dallas area.
</P>
<P>
   I still think about making a bet from time to time, but the
consequences aren't something I want to deal with _ at least not at
this point in my life.
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing, is I now have piece of mind. The phone
rings and I don't scramble to answer it. The mail comes and I don't
run out the door to get it before my wife can. I sleep well _ and
so does the rest of my family.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been easy, but I've never gone back, not even for a $1
lottery ticket or a Pepsi on a baseball game. But I could. I could
tomorrow, and I know that if I do, normal life will end for me, and
the nightmare will begin again. And will probably get worse.
</P>
<P>
   My father died five years ago Christmas Eve. Shortly before his
death, he said to me, ``I love you. And now, I respect you.''
</P>
<P>
   I hope I never betray that trust.

CLEMENS DOESN'T GUARANTEE SUCCESS, MAY RESTRICT FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roger Clemens is 36, and he has pitched in one World Series
during his 15-year career.
</P>
<P>
   He's definitely a No. 1 pitcher in any rotation. But he will not
offer guaranteed success to the team that acquires him and anyone
that does will have to give up talent that's both equal and _
understand this carefully _ much younger.
</P>
<P>
   That has to be realized by the people who are mindlessly
screaming to go get Clemens, once again believing he will be the
Rangers' ``final piece of the puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring Clemens might get the Rangers to the World Series.
However there's a greater possibility it could turn the Rangers
into a mirror image of the Baltimore Orioles: a team with a
free-spending owner, great ballpark, a bloated payroll and a
hodge-podge of great talent, good enough to contend but not good
enough to win.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave them in the vicious never-ending cycle they've
been in since 1986, when manager Bobby Valentine interrupted a
major rebuilding program by winning 87 games and deluded the
franchise into thinking they were getting close.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rangers are going to trade Ivan Rodriguez, they ought to
trade him to a team that can give them two or three great young
pitching prospects in return. Then you go out and sign Terry
Steinbach and have done two things: kept yourself competitive and
still made the future look a whole lot brighter.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, in seven years this team could be loaded with
All-Star outfielders Ruben Mateo and Mike Zywica, second baseman
Kelly Dransfeldt and catcher Cesar King ... and still be looking
for starting pitching. RANDOM OBSERVATIONS The continued escalation
of salaries is final proof the devastating 1994 players strike that
forced cancellation of the World Series and ripped apart the
public's trust accomplished absolutely nothing. Zero. The rich
still get richer and the poor have absolutely no chance. And the
poor substantially outnumber the rich.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf admitted two years ago that
signing Albert Belle to a $55 million contract would spell death to
the small-market clubs. Little did he know that he would be signing
his own club's death warrant. Welcome to the poor side of town,
Jerry.
</P>
<P>
   Three keys to the Rangers having strong leadership in 1999:
Rusty Greer emerging out of Will Clark's shadow, Mark McLemore
being healthy and happy again, and Rafael Palmeiro building the
bridge that brings Ivan Rodriguez and Juan Gonzalez back to the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro was docked $4 million per year for not being perceived
as a leader. That's the difference in pay between him and Mo
Vaughn, who's considered the consummate leader. Responded Palmeiro,
``I'm a quiet leader. When it's time to take charge, I lead by
example.'' Cal Ripken Jr. is the only player in the Baltimore
Orioles lineup who was originally drafted by the club. Designated
hitters Chris Hoiles and Willie Greene, catcher Charles Johnson and
outfielder Brady Anderson were acquired in trades and outfielders
Albert Belle and B.J. Surhoff, shortstop Mike Bordick, second
baseman Delino DeShields and first baseman Will Clark were added as
free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will move on Clemens mainly out of fear that the
Indians will get him and have that long-needed No. 1 starter.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown is taking his sweet time on deciding where he'll
play next year. Agent Scott Boras is most likely waiting until the
winter meetings next weekend in Nashville, Tenn., when he has all
general managers assembled in one spot and can drive up the price.
Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash will probably take the same
approach with Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks owner Jerry Colangelo hired some of the best
front-office talent around, including Sandy Johnson, Roland Hemond
and Mel Didier. But he has now has apparently decided to take the
Wayne Huizenga route to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have quietly done a nice job of improving an 88-74 team
from last year. But this may be manager Bobby Valentine's last
chance. If he doesn't get into the playoffs after the money being
spent by the Mets owners, he could have a hard time keeping his
job. The pressure from the New York media is getting intense.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Johnson did not hit well last year, but he's still a
superb defensive catcher with some offensive potential. The Dodgers
are making a huge mistake if they think they're better off with
Todd Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Johnson, he won four consecutive Gold Gloves in the
National League. Being traded to Baltimore puts him in direct
competition with Rodriguez, who has won the last seven catching
awards in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Hall of Fame ballot includes not one but three
ex-Rangers pitchers on for the first time: Nolan Ryan, Charlie
Leibrandt and Frank Tanana. Bert Blyleven is on for a second time.

PLUS-MINUS DOESN'T ALWAYS ADD UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Plus-minus might be the most confusing statistic in the NHL.
Some players even call it inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   And, in truth, simply saying the Flyers' Eric Lindros is the
best player in the NHL because of his plus-18 rating through
Thursday's games is as wrong as saying the Tampa Bay Lightning's
Karl Dykhuis is the worst because of his minus-17 rating.
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem with plus-minus. When extremes are brought in
and then spread across the spectrum of the NHL, the statistic can
be misleading. But if studied properly, plus-minus can shed a good
deal of light onto the efforts of a player in the framework of his
team.
</P>
<P>
   The basic premise of plus-minus is to measure a player's value
by counting the times he is on the ice for a goal in a ``fair''
situation. For example, in all even-strength situations, goals for
and goals against are counted _ telling whether you are a positive
player or a negative player.
</P>
<P>
   If you're on the power play and score a goal, the goal doesn't
count toward your plus. If you're killing a penalty and an opponent
scores a goal, the goal doesn't count against your minus. It's not
fair to be rewarded when you have the man advantage, the NHL
reasons, or punished when you're a man down. However, if you score
a goal short-handed, you receive a plus and the opposing power play
players receive a minus. Again, it's fair to believe that with the
man advantage, a team shouldn't be scored upon.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the best way to study plus-minus is within a team.
For example, Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk is a plus-8, while
fellow defenseman Sergei Zubov and Darryl Sydor are minus-2 apiece.
Mike Modano is a plus-10, while Joe Nieuwendyk is a minus-3.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams have similar trends. In Anahiem, Stu Grimson is a
plus-3, while fellow tough guy Jim McKenzie is a minus-10. Both
have relatively the same job, so the comparison is easy.
</P>
<P>
   Or take, for example, the Blackhawks' Chris Chelios. On a team
that is literally all minuses, including a minus-9 for leading
scorer Tony Amonte, Chelios is a plus-4. He has to be doing
something right.
</P>
<P>
   Or look at the Flyers. Lindros is plus-18. John LeClair is
plus-16 and most of the team is on the positive side of the ledger.
But center Chris Gratton is a minus-7 and the Flyers are trying to
trade him. That's where the statistic can be really telling.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads us to the one player who probably deserves more
accolades than any other for plus-minus and yet isn't anywhere
among the league leaders. His Tampa Bay Lightning has six players
in double-digit minuses, including the aforementioned Dykhuis at
minus-17, and yet he has somehow posted a plus-2 rating.
</P>
<P>
   Take a bow Daymond Langkow, now that's an accomplishment. SLAP
SHOTS
KING RED WINGS Whatever problems the Detroit Red Wings have had
this season, Stars fans who hate the Wings shouldn't think the
two-time defending champs are going away easily. They recently went
on a 4-1 run with rookie goalie Norm Maracle leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until somebody takes the Stanley Cup away from the Red Wings,
there's nobody close,'' Sharks coach Darryl Sutter said. ``They're
the best team in the league by 10 miles. I mean, is there any team
in the league that can play four lines and have their starting
goalie out for a period of time and it doesn't bother them at
all?'' He's new at this Tampa Bay Lightning owner Art Williams, who
bought the team from a Japanese coglomerate last season, alreay is
disillusioned with the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Williams called his players ``pansies,'' last week and said, ``I
refuse to sit there and cater to a bunch of overpriced
cry-babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams added: ``This season has been a brutal lesson for me. I
was told we were a few players away from a competitive team, so I
willingly spent even more money than we had budgeted.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who told him that _ GM Phil Esposito _ has since been
fired.
NEW BLOOD
</P>
<P>
   Last week was the one-year anniversary of Canada getting shut
out in the quest for an Olympic hockey medal, and Team Canada GM
Bob Clarke made it clear he's not coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose like we did, I don't think I should get another
crack at it,'' the Flyers GM said. ``Someone else should come in as
a manager.''
</P>
<P>
   The leading candidate to be that someone else is Stars GM Bob
Gainey, who was Clarke's assistant.
TIGHT POCKETS The Penguins, who currently are trying to work out of
bankruptcy court, made their Nov. 30 payroll only because of the
infusion of $2.5 million in cash from trading Petr Nedved to the
Rangers. Now, they're seeking a $20 million loan from a French bank
to make the Dec. 15 payroll.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, the cash value of superstar Jaromir Jagr has to
become a very serious discussion, if NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman
would allow such a trade.
THE BUZZ
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Conference: John Vanbiesbrouck, who has a 2.03 goals
against average, is receiving credit as the man who could finally
help solve the Flyers' goaltending problems. But a quick look at
the stats reveals coach Roger Nielson might be the real hero. The
Flyers are yielding a league-least 20.3 shots per game under
Nielson's defense-first system. The Stars, who led the NHL last
season, are second in that category at 22.9 shots per game. ...
Sabres winger Rob Ray is the latest NHL player on a long list to
get a suspension, taking a four-game hiatus after slew-footing
Panthers winger Alex Hicks. Slew-footing is intentionally knocking
the legs out from underneath an opposing player, forcing him to
fall, often times on his head. ... The Caps continue to struggle as
Adam Oates and Peter Bondra are in and out of the lineup with
nagging groin injuries. ... The Lightning have talked about
waiving, trading or demoting former Stars winger Benoit Hogue. ...
The Rangers are trying to begin discussions with defenseman Bryan
Leetch on a contract extension. Leetch, who is making up for last
season's horrendous start by scoring 19 points in 24 games, could
become the highest paid defenseman in the league, surpassing Rob
Blake's $5.5 million per season. ... Wayne Gretzky's greatest
nemesis ever is _ Tommy Salo? That's right, the Islanders young
goalie had not yielded a goal to Gretzky in nine games, the longest
The Great One had been shut out by a goalie. But Gretzky ended that
streak last week, scoring in a 3-2 Rangers' win on Wednesday. ...
Former Stars defenseman Kevin Hatcher is supposedly next on the
trading block for the Penguins, who need to unload all the salary
they can. The older brother of Stars captain Derian Hatcher, Kevin
is actually having a decent season with 16 points and a plus-9
rating. The Kings and Mighty Ducks are said to be interested. ...
The Bruins get no slack at all from their fans. After a 1-1 tie in
Boston on Tuesday, the Fleet Center crowd booed their homeboys, who
dropped all the way to 6-1-4 in an 11-game span with the tie. ...
Just one more reason why the Maple Leafs are surprising everyone _
No. 2 center Igor Korolev has six goals among 20 points and is a
plus 10.
</P>
<P>
   Western Conference: If there was any debate that the Kings' Rob
Blake was the most valuable defenseman in the NHL last season, it's
been put to rest now that Blake is out with a broken right foot and
isn't expected back until the end of the month. The Kings have gone
1-9 in their past 10 games, and in seven of those games scored one
or fewer goals, leading one to believe that their injured goalies
are not the problem. ... After posting a league-best 11-game
point-scoring streak, Mighty Ducks winger Paul Kariya was held
without a point in three consecutive games. ... The Coyotes saw
their 14-game unbeaten streak end in a 4-3 loss to Edmonton, but
made the Oilers work for it. Oilers goalie Mikhail Shtalenkov had
45 saves in the win. ... The Coyotes also fell short of tying an
NHL record. They had allowed two goals or fewer in 18 consecutive
games before giving up four. The record for consecutive games of
two goals or fewer is 19 set by the Montreal Canadiens in 1958-59.
... Blues goalie Grant Fuhr is back on the ice practicing after
injuring his groin Nov. 7. His return date is up in the air, but
he's ahead of the original prognosis of six weeks. Fuhr was 3-1-2
with a 2.06 GAA and a .915 save percentage when he was injured. ...
Sharks winger Owen Nolan has scored two goals in his past 35
regular season games. ... Sharks goalie Steve Shields is getting no
help. Shields has a 2.00 GAA and a .924 save percentage, but is
just 1-2-2.
THE WEEK AHEAD
Tuesday: Flyers at Devils _ Two favorites to battle for East crown
give fans a juicy preview. Thursday: Devils at Flyers _ With a
little bad blood going after one meeting two days earlier, this one
could be even juicier. Saturday: Red Wings at Hurricanes _
Hurricanes owner Peter Karmanos still loves to beat Red Wings owner
Mike Ilitch at anything. Plus, this is about the only team that can
fill the Greensboro Coliseum.

 &HT;    A book policymakers can't ignore
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Emory University welcomed William Bowen to Atlanta
last week. Bowen, former president of Princeton University, is
co-author of the book, ``The Shape of the River,'' which documents
through meticulous research the positive impact of affirmative
action on college admissions. The book shows that numbers of black
students admitted to highly selective schools would be sliced in
half even today if race were not allowed to be used as one of many
factors in admission policies.
</P>
<P>
   Emory President William Chace said the book confirms what he's
always believed: that race-conscious college admissions have worked
to the good of America by producing black professionals and
community leaders and encouraged the growth of a healthy black
middle class. Emory, many of whose graduates were interviewed for
the study, was a private school pioneer _ suing successfully 36
years ago to overturn state legislation barring private schools
from receiving tax exemptions if it admitted blacks. Now the
school, blessed with Coca-Cola benefactors, has a higher percentage
of African-American students and faculty than any among the top 25
with which Emory ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there were no lawmakers at Bowen's lecture. I
wished privately that he had been invited to speak at the upcoming
orientation for state legislators at the University of Georgia.
They could do with some real facts to shoot down the myths spouted
year after year on the floor on the General Assembly:
</P>
<P>
   _ Affirmative action harms blacks by denigrating their ability
to compete.
</P>
<P>
   _ Affirmative action equals quotas (outlawed by the U.S. Supreme
Court years ago _ and not supported by Bowen or his co-author,
former Harvard President Derek Bok).
</P>
<P>
   _ Affirmative action is no longer needed and should be replaced
by economic disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   All of those arguments are dismissed with scholarly data that
can be dissected in a million ways and still hold. African-American
male graduates of Ivy League schools, with identical skills,
experience and positions, still make an average of $8,000 less per
year than white counterparts. The differential is, of course,
greater for less well-educated and less skilled.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue that caught my attention in the book and in
Bowen's talk is the examination of the meaning of ``merit,''
probably because I've heard so many politicians repeat the tired
line that all students should be judged on merit, as if that had
never happened. It's the standard rhetoric for Georgia Rep. Earl
Ehrhart who proposes a bill every year to abolish what few
affirmative action programs remain in Georgia schools and agencies.
His bill would do away with the minimal program at the University
of Georgia, which includes race as one of 16 criteria for 10
percent of incoming freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Surely merit was never meant to be limited to test scores,
though. It includes drive, achievement, determination, character, a
hundred other factors. Certainly African-American students (whose
scores met the minimum requirement for admission) were accepted
over some whites whose scores were higher. But so were some white
students with lower scores than whites who were rejected. There's
no way around subjectivity in competitive admissions decisions, and
there shouldn't be. Merit assessment is forward looking, predictive
of college and post-college performance. Admissions policies
consider how students individually and collectively will enhance
the educational experience and the institution.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowen-Bok book should be required reading for policymakers.
But I can say with certainty it won't be. Those who oppose
affirmative action, be they Californians or Georgians, aren't open
to real data. The excuse under the Georgia Gold Dome will be, it's
just a bunch of Yankee eggheads trying to lord it over us again.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Opposites attract when politicians label
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore recently touted his political philosophy,
which he called ``practical idealism.'' He is road-testing this
phrase for the 2000 presidential election when he might have to put
it up against the ``compassionate conservatism'' of Texas Gov.
George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a choice between practical idealism and compassionate
conservatism, an idealistically cynical voter could be clearly
flummoxed.
</P>
<P>
   This is not anything new. The tradition of politicians straining
language and credulity to advance logically opposed ideas is long
and distinguished.
</P>
<P>
   In Roman times, the Emperor Augustus wasn't a strongman, boss,
mack daddy or maximum head of human resources. He liked to describe
himself modestly as ``primus inter pares,'' first among equals.
</P>
<P>
   Whiners may have quietly asked how someone can be both first and
equal. In practice, this was decided easily enough. The equal who
ran the Roman army could be as equal as he wanted to be. Still, as
political fictions go, this one proved soothing and still sounds
just fine after 2,000 years of use.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, currently second among equals at the White House, says his
phrase is meant to convey a philosophy that ``applies the values of
the past to the amazing opportunities of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, the best of opposites. Like a telescope fitted with a
rearview mirror, it certainly would be versatile, but your eyes get
blurry imagining how it would work.
</P>
<P>
   Such an instrument could prove a hard sell against compassionate
conservatism, which means Republicans will no longer take pleasure
in what they have to do to folks so taxes can be low, people who
live wrong can be punished and profits maximized.
</P>
<P>
   A hard choice for voters here. Particularly voters who are
restlessly complacent, cautiously optimistic or raging moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Opposites are attractive in other labels as well.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is a practical idealist because he is a New Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   This means he's a member of the world's oldest continuously
operating political party, but in a new way. Being new means he's
not like '70s Democrats but more like the Democrats we remembered
before the last generation of Democrats. Not an Old Democrat, but
more like an Old, Old Democrat _ which now is new. Or was new until
it started to get old.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by contrast, is a Big-Tent Republican. This should not be
confused with the clowns of Big-Top Republicanism but it still
evokes images of elephants in a circus.
</P>
<P>
   Compassionate conservatives want a big tent but small
government. Grouchy, old-fashioned conservatives want a small tent
with the right kind of people, no tent taxes and the right to pitch
it in a wetland if they feel like it. And smoke as they do so.
</P>
<P>
   Many Small-Tent Republicans are young fogies, conservative
revolutionaries and new traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to be gullibly skeptical about these claims. But I
believe Bush can be compassionate and Gore both new and improved.
I'll trust but verify, as former President Reagan promised to do
when he was being tough but fair.
</P>
<P>
   I do this because I have taken to heart the words of former
Florida Gov. Bob Martinez when he promised, in his legislative
dealings, to be ``firm but flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   This phrase sowed confusion among a literal-minded capital press
corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean, like Gumby?'' asked one reporter, vainly trying to
recall any other exemplar of firm flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter was not trying to be helpful. He was being
playfully hostile. But he was on to something. Gumby is
demonstrably both flexible and firm _ you can bend any toy Gumby to
prove it. And he might be animal, mineral or vegetable. Who can
say? Surely, this is an apt but ambiguous political symbol for our
age.
</P>
<P>
   Whether anyone will have the foresight and copyright to run with
this remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, I look forward to the next election with
fearful anticipation. Any battle between practical idealism and
compassionate conservatism could prove seriously amusing.

 &HT;    Digesting the idea of a spagetti junction in Lufkin
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ The big news in my little hometown is that the
interstate highway system has finally found its way here, some 40
or 50 years after cementing together most everywhere else in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Folks in favor of the interstate say it's for the common good of
the common man. Of course, folks in favor of the Mobil-Exxon merger
are likely to say much the same.
</P>
<P>
   Lufkin's not exactly isolated, off here in the Pineywoods of
Deep East Texas. Granted, the nearest existing interstates are 100
miles in most any direction. Never mind that the airlines won't fly
here.
</P>
<P>
   If you're coming to Lufkin from afar, best bet is to fly to
Houston or Shreveport and then rent a car for the two-hour drive.
It's not that convenient for everybody. But in the past it's helped
to deter big-city corporate-baggers from giving us more attention
than we would appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   We've got highways, sure enough. Paved, too. Not counting the
pot holes, of course. I doubt if anybody could count the pot holes,
especially on U.S. 59 between here and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   That highway has a certain Third World charm. You'd almost think
you were in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   For a fact, U.S. 59 is on its way to Mexico. Thanks to NAFTA,
the traffic is something akin to wall-to-wall diesel trucks backed
up most all the way to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the purpose of the proposed interstate, dubbed I-69, a
major trade route for the NAFTA traffic that's taking our business
south.
</P>
<P>
   Lufkin's leaders have been all for it. Otherwise, the world
might pass us by, without so much as honking.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the preferred route will swing east of the city,
cutting a swath through farms, ranches and rural settlements. What
used to be out in the country is now going to be under an
underpass.
</P>
<P>
   I'm waiting for our first cloverleaf intersection to open up for
local traffic. That'll be something to see, especially in a town
where most drivers have yet to master the principle of four-way
stop signs.
</P>
<P>
   But I've seen it all before, to lesser degrees.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a young boy, the highway traffic came straight
through downtown on First Street. Back then, there was a service
station on every other corner.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays there's only one left along that same route.
</P>
<P>
   That's because of Timberland Drive, the four-lane bypass that
opened in 1950. The cafes and service stations followed in swift
pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Funny story that most everybody has forgotten, how Timberland
Drive got its name.
</P>
<P>
   Several names of prominent leaders had been put forth for the
honor. So it was that the powers that be decided to let the people
choose, in the form of an election, as to who among the prominent
was the most favored. The choice of Timberland Drive was added to
the ballot as an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what won by a wide majority. Timberland Drive, by any
other name, was None Of The Above Drive.
</P>
<P>
   A loop followed in the 1960s and '70s, and business stretched
itself accordingly. I expect much the same when the interstate
arrives.
</P>
<P>
   I have every hope of living to see that day, assuming that
between now and then I don't get run over at one of our four-way
stops.

 &HT;    Mental health officials try to get a hold on `basket' restraint
misuse
 &HT;    By William Cooper Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Unless national standards for training
and the use of physical restraint are developed, state and national
experts believe more people like 17-year-old Laura Hanson will die.
</P>
<P>
   Police are still investigating Hanson's death, which was ruled a
homicide by asphyxia. She died at on Nov. 19 after two employees
put her in the controversial ``basket hold,'' a restraint that has
lead to the deaths of mental health patients across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Child Welfare League of America, the nation's oldest child
advocacy organization, is pushing for national standards regarding
the use of restraint, said Lloyd Bullard, director of residential
care for the Washington-based nonprofit agency. Bullard said the
group wants federal legislation that will require training and
mandatory reporting of restraint deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to influence the legislation if we can,'' Bullard
said.
</P>
<P>
   Low pay and poor training are contributing factors to the
restraint deaths, he said. Typically, the workers who are in direct
contact with the patients and have to administer the restraint are
paid anywhere from $15,000 to $17,000, Bullard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find that some of these direct-care workers are competing
with the fast-food workers when it comes to salaries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the staff members who restrained Hanson have not
been released, nor has their training, experience and salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bullard believes the lack of national standards for the use of
restraint has left mental health officials to police themselves.
Without federal regulation, the oversight varies from state to
state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He and other advocates want a system that tracks restraint
deaths and specific training measures for mental health employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to ban restraint use. We can't allow clients to
endanger themselves or others,'' Bullard said. ``I think the real
focus has to be on national standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest drawback has been a lack of money. If the federal
government creates standards, there also should be money offered to
centers for staff training.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, states such as Florida look to experts such as Dr.
John Ward, the clinical director at the Florida Mental Health
Institute at the University of South Florida in Tampa. Ward and his
colleagues crafted a form of restraint called T.E.A.M. _ Techniques
for Effective Aggression Management.
</P>
<P>
   The concept was developed a decade ago in response to a boy who
died while being restrained at a state juvenile detention center
near Tampa, Ward said. The T.E.A.M. approach calls for the patient
to be restrained by more than one person, and places emphasis on
monitoring the patient's ability to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a person can talk, then they're breathing,'' Ward said.
``You leave room for the chest to expand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward estimates some 60,000 mental health professionals have been
trained nationally in the T.E.A.M. approach.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, the Department of Children and Families regulates
mental health centers and approves the types of restraint they can
use, Ward said. In the T.E.A.M. approach, staff members must
undergo 18 to 20 hours of training before they're eligible to
assist in the use of restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Trainers in the T.E.A.M. concept need another 18 to 20 hours of
training, along with teaching the technique while being observed by
panel of peers.
</P>
<P>
   The South County Mental Health Center in Delray Beach uses the
T.E.A.M. concept, said Jeffrey Lefton, an administrator at the
facility. The South County center has a special unit for youngsters
who need immediate stabilization because they've gone into a mental
health crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson was restrained by employees after she got into a fight
with her 15-year-old roommate. After refusing to calm down, two
employees placed her in the basket hold for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Those workers are on paid administrative leave until the
investigation is finished. The state and the National Alliance for
the Mentally Ill of Palm Beach County are reviewing if the
employees were properly trained in the use of restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from DCF's alcohol, drug abuse and mental health
division visited the center last week.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Suresh Rajpara, the center's medical director, said the
staff members have been trained in crisis prevention techniques,
but he would not elaborate on the training procedures or the amount
of training received by the employees involved in Hanson's death.
</P>
<P>
   The basket hold is a technique commonly used in mental health
centers, Bullard said. The hold becomes deadly when the patient is
placed face-down, pressure is placed on the backs and the patient's
arms are criss-crossed over the chest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the police nor the center have revealed Hanson's
position when she died.
</P>
<P>
   Any time someone dies while being restrained it affects the
entire mental health industry, said Linda Steiger, president of the
Crisis Prevention Institute in Wisconsin. The backlash can lead to
fear among the parents of patients to a chilling-affect among staff
members who must work with the clients.
</P>
<P>
   CPI, which is one of the nation's leaders in crisis management,
teaches nonviolent techniques as well as physical restraint. The
primary goal of the program is to certify employees to return to
their jobs and teach other staff members, Steiger said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees are taught to use as many methods as possible to bring
calm to a situation without having to use restraint. However, when
restraint is necessary, the events usually happen quickly, Steiger
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why using restraint must be the choice of last resort,
she said.
</P>

 &HT;    Two-strikes laws often lack intended impact
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Half-brothers Maurice Bentley and Anton Tukes were
convicted of raping their sisters. Under the mandatory state
sentencing law, they should have gotten 10-year prison sentences.
Instead, they got one year and have been free since February.
</P>
<P>
   And the man accused of the October slaying of five people,
including three downtown Hilton hotel guests, should have been in
jail, about one-third of his way through a 10-year term for
aggravated sodomy. Instead, he was on 10 years' probation. Faced
with a weak case because the victim didn't want to testify against
Timothy Carl Dawson, the state had to offer a probation term in
exhange for a plea, said former Fulton County Assisstant District
Attorney Charles Smegal.
</P>
<P>
   Since the state sentencing law took effect in 1995 in response
to public pressure to get tougher on crime, there have been at
least 130 cases _ about one in 20 _ in which violent felons have
escaped the mandatory minimum sentence for convictions under the
so-called ``two strikes'' law, said Deputy State Attorney General
Mary Beth Westmoreland.
</P>
<P>
   The lesser sentences go against Gov. Zell Miller's 1994 pledge
to make Georgia's sentencing laws the nation's toughest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply cannot understand why any judge, who is sworn to
uphold the law, won't follow it when it's plainly written in black
and white,'' said Miller. ``I continue to be alarmed.''
</P>
<P>
   And the lawyer who researched all the nation's two-strikes and
three-strikes laws found weaknesses in virtually every state,
including Georgia _ one of only two that actually enforced the law,
even on a limited basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence of the law seems to be irrelevant,'' said Walter
Dickey, special counsel to the nonprofit Campaign for an Effective
Crime Policy, which funded the research.
</P>
<P>
   But even as some prosecutors and judges are not enforcing the
mandatory minimum sentences for the crimes listed in the Georgia
Sentencing Reform Act, some policy-makers are talking about
limiting judges' discretion even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we need to get this one that we have on the
books now straight first,'' said Attorney General Thurbert Baker,
who, as a legislator, sponsored the two strikes law for Governor
Miller. ``I just wish people would follow the law.''
</P>
<P>
   What the law says
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 act says anyone convicted of armed robbery, kidnapping,
aggravated child molestation, aggravated sodomy, rape or aggravated
sexual battery must spend at least 10 years in prison and cannot be
paroled. A second conviction for any of those six felonies or for
murder _ known collectively as the seven deadly sins _ demands life
without parole.
</P>
<P>
   The language of the statute is precise: There must be prison
time, and probation is forbidden if any of those crimes were
committed after Jan. 1, 1995. The inmate cannot be pardoned or
paroled and the sentence cannot be commuted.
</P>
<P>
   But it often doesn't happen that way.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 16-year-old Johnathan Davis, who admitted to sexual
assault for fondling a 13-year-old girl, should have gotten a
10-year sentence. Instead, he received two years and will be free
late next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the president of the District Attorneys Association of
Georgia can explain why the law isn't being followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a prosecutor, I would hope _ particularly when it comes to
this type of legislation that makes us the toughest in the nation
on violent criminals _ that all prosecutors and judges would follow
the law,'' said Coweta Judicial Circuit District Attorney Pete
Skandalakis, the association president. ``It's surprising to me
that the mandatory-minimum sentences for the `seven deadly sins'
...are not being enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker says there is no excuse for giving a prison sentence that
does not at least meet the minimum that the law requires.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way that law was written, if they are charged with one of
those seven deadly sins, they must be sentenced to 10 years to
serve in prison for the first strike and life without parole for
the second,'' Baker said. ``There is no discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   But he admits that there is no way to force judges to follow
comply with the statute, though ``you would expect and hope that
the judges would follow the law. I'm sort of surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,375 inmates have been convicted of one of the seven
deadly sins since the law took effect in 1995. But judges did not
follow sentencing requirements in 130 cases. When the state
attorney general's office pointed out the illegal sentences, local
judges revised 10 of them. Yet, 70 of that 130 are still serving a
term less than the required life without parole for a second
offense. And another 50 _ like Tukes, Bentley and Davis _ have been
sentenced to fewer than 10 years for their first conviction. Seven
of those 50 so-called first-strikers are already out of prison.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say they have no way of knowing how many violent
felons on probation should be in prison under the ``two strikes
law.'' Their computer records only show the date the sentence was
returned, not when the crime was committed. The law is based on the
date of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections spokesman Scott Stallings said ``it would be
reasonable to assume that there is a small number of offenders who
received probation instead of the mandatory prison sentence called
for in the seven deadly sins legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   A response to pressure
</P>
<P>
   The sentencing problem became apparent soon after the law took
effect. In September 1996, Miller sternly wrote prosecutors and
judges, reminding them of the highly publicized and popular law.
Some sentences were corrected, either by resentencing the defendant
under the guidelines or downgrading the charges so the law did not
apply.
</P>
<P>
   Lowndes County District Attorney David Miller said prosecutors
and judges have no choice but to comply with the mandatory-minimums
that are now law, but he worried that more structured sentences
could present a problem. He expects the state's prosecutors to make
a make a joint statement later this month protesting more
mandatory-minimums
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us less discretion to deal with these folks,'' Miller
said. ``A lot of people would feel better about the criminal
justice system if there was more truth in setencing. The numbers
(of years sentenced and actual years served) should be closer. The
Georgia sentencing laws have been changed in such a hodgepodge way,
maybe it's just time to go back and look at the entire sentencing
schedule and redo it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some prosecutors, judges and criminal justice experts have
suggested that the range of prison time available might be reduced
so that the actual time served would more closely resemble the
court sentence. For example, a judge can sentence a burglar to one
year in prison or as much as 20 years in prison. Prosecutor Miller
says the range of 1 to 20 years in some case and five to 30 years
for other crimes may be too much and should be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   That might improve the public perception that criminals serve
only a portion of their sentences even though the time might be
more than what is doled out in other states for the same crime,
said Rep. Denny Dobbs (D-Covington), who has been working on a
sentencing reform proposal since last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Symbolism vs. substance
</P>
<P>
   ``Our criminal justice policy should not be based on symbolism,
but on substance,'' Northeastern Judicial Circuit Judge John
Giradeau told the Dobbs at a meeting this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs, chair of the House committee that oversees the state
prison system, plans to offer a report with substative
recommendations for reform to the General Assembly before his term
ends in January and he leaves the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is tired of all the publicity they have seen about
violent criminals being released on parole or getting probation,''
Dobbs said. ``The two-strikes law was a response to public pressure
to do something about violent offenders and habitual offenders.''
</P>
<P>
   In all the cases of illegal sentences, the punishment was part
of a negotiated plea. Prosecutors say it was the best alternative,
given that a jury most likely would have acquitted the defendant
because the case was weak. Judges _ like the one who gave Tukes and
Bentley invalid sentences _ said they ordered an invalid prison
sentence because the prosecutor recommended it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One size fits all laws'' are a problem, said Eastern Judicial
Circuit Superior Court Judge John E. Morse Jr., who sentenced
Bentley and Tukes to two years for rape instead of 10 in the
Savannah case. ``Mandatory-minimums can be helpful, and they can be
quite a hindrance. With them in place, you don't have discretion,
which tends to take the pressure off. But at the same time, when
discretion is needed, you don't have it. It's a double-edged sword.
''
</P>
<P>
   Invalid sentences not always clear
</P>
<P>
   When sentencing standards are not followed, the Department of
Corrections is supposed to refuse to pick up the inmates from the
county jails. But Westmoreland of the AG's office said the invalid
sentences are not always obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs said he has heard in his House hearings that prosecutors
and judges oppose structured sentencing, especially any system like
those in other states that reduce or eliminate prison time for the
less serious crimes. Perhaps, Dobbs said, more mandatory-minimum
sentences is not the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judges want to be judges. They want to weigh the merits of
a particular offense and assign punishment to a particular
criminal,'' Dobbs said.
</P>
<P>
   And some prosecutors agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence that my colleagues and judges will come up
with more appropriate decisions than a hard and fast rule,'' said
John Pridgen, the district attorney for Cordeale Judicial Circuit
in South Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed that leaving some discretion, with the possiblity that
the felon will serve only a portion of a sentence, might be better
than giving them shorter sentences with no parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather see them do three years on a 10-year sentence
than18 months on an 18-month sentence,'' he said.

 &HT;    Texas lawmakers reap plentiful reward for their work _ after
they retire
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ During his first eight years in office, Texas
paid state Rep. Charles Finnell $400 a month to make laws. For the
next 21 years, the state paid him a princely $600 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Finnell's constituents fired him.
</P>
<P>
   Come January, Texas will set him up with a retirement package
worth about $5,700 a month, or more than $68,500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Life in the below-minimum-wage Texas Legislature is not all that
lucrative. But ahhhh, the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leaving with no sour grapes whatsoever toward the
legislative process,'' said Finnell, who plans to meet with state
officials this week to craft his retirement package.
</P>
<P>
   Texas pays longtime lawmakers more to stop making laws than they
were paid to make laws. The lucrative retirement plan was created
by lawmakers in 1975, and next year it will be very, very good to
an unusually high number of longtime legislators who are leaving
office.
</P>
<P>
   The newly retired, as well as those already on the plan, also
will benefit from an increase approved this year by the Employees
Retirement System board.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is lucrative because lawmakers made it that way. In
1975 (Finnell likes to point out that he was not in the Legislature
that year), lawmakers voted to tie their retirement checks to state
district judges' salaries, which are set by the Legislature.
Lawmakers contribute 8 percent of their token-payment paychecks
(now $7,200 a year) into the retirement fund.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-legislators who served at least eight years _ those who
retired voluntarily and those retired by the voters _ qualify for
the pension plan at age 60. Lawmakers who hang on for 12 years
qualify at age 50.
</P>
<P>
   For each year of service, they get credit for 2.25 percent of
state district judges' salary _ currently $101,700 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sept. 1, the multiplier was 2 percent. The increase
amounts to a 12.5 percent raise for retirees. A retired lawmaker
who was getting $50,000 before Sept. 1, for example, now gets an
additional $6,250 a year. The Employees Retirement System, not the
Legislature, enacted the increase. The Retirement System increased
the multiplier to match an increase the Legislature approved last
year for the state employees retirement plan _ which is not keyed
to the high-dollar judicial salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Finnell, ousted last month in a 257-vote loss (out of 29,451
cast) to Republican Rick Hardcastle of Vernon, thinks the system he
is about to cash in on is a bad one. He believes lawmakers'
pensions should be keyed to teachers' salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many legislative pensioners, Finnell says he is going
home to his family's oil field business. Many ex-lawmakers hang
around Austin and become lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   And, for many of them, the legislative retirement money offers a
nice side income. That really grates on the government do-gooder
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary numbers from an upcoming report by Texans for Public
Justice show that 56 ex-lawmakers who lobbied during the 1997
legislative session pulled in more than $1.4 million in state
pension checks.
</P>
<P>
   That's an average of about $25,430. And that's above the state's
per capita income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because too many ex-legislators can't resist the premiums they
command as influence peddlers, the Texas Legislature suffers a
split personality,'' said Craig McDonald of Texans for Public
Justice. ``Formally, it is the body that sets the laws of the land.
Informally, it's the state's premier finishing school for
lobbyists.''
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Rep. Hugo Berlanga of Corpus Christi is among the recent
graduates of the finishing school. He resigned his House seat last
May after 21 years and joined the lobby corps.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on top of the money he earns lobbying, Berlanga, who hit
the magic 50 in August, is entitled to a retirement package worth
about $48,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   It's nuts, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had a system where legislators in Texas were compensated
adequately for their work we probably wouldn't have a retirement
system that is totally upside down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers' salaries aren't the only component in their
compensation package. Legislators also receive a per diem, now $95
a day during a legislative session. That could go up this week,
just in time for the 76th Legislature, which convenes Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Ethics Commission, at a meeting scheduled for Friday,
is expected to approve a staff proposal to increase the per diem to
$119, the new maximum allowed by the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   The system is screaming for scrutiny, says Tom Smith, Texas
director of Public Citizen, a government watchdog group that has
been barking for years about the state's low-pay Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to lawmaking, you get what you pay for, according
to Smith. You're better off paying them now _ the form of something
resembling a living wage _ than paying them later, he said, adding
that the current system encourages all manner of inappropriate
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives good members _ good members who should stay in the
Legislature _ the wrong incentive,'' Smith said. ``Sometimes they
retire because they can't afford not to. And it keeps bad ones in
because the retirement package is so sweet. You have members who
are bored with it, who don't want to be there, who will continue
for four or six years beyond the time they ought to be there just
so they can get the retirement package.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite consensus that the system is out of whack _ too skimpy
on salary, too generous on retirement benefits _ the public's lack
of interest in a pay hike probably guarantees it will persist.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to pushing for a pay raise, a concept rejected with
some regularity by voters, Smith is backing a concept that has even
less of a chance of passing. No pensions for
lawmakers-turned-lobbyists, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only have we trained them how to be great lobbyists at
state expense, but then we continue to give them an allowance after
they are gone and support them while they are raking in hundreds of
thousands of dollars from private interests for going back and
lobbying their old buddies,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald of Texans for Public Justice, has a simpler proposal:
Ban lobbying-for-pay by ex-elected officials. That would be a ban
that could hit close to home for several lawmakers leaving office
this year. A handful of longtime House members are about to make
the transition from low-priced lawmaker to high-dollar retiree.
Some will also be lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the top 10 House members on the longevity list will not
be back. Finnell was defeated. L.P. ``Pete'' Patterson,
D-Brookston, mounted an unsuccessful bid for state agriculture
commissioner. Berlanga and Al Price, D-Beaumont, resigned. Dan
Kubiak, D-Rockdale, died while seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Other senior members not coming back _ as least not as
legislators _ include 18-year veteran Jim Horn, R-Denton, and
16-year veterans Mark Stiles, D-Beaumont, and Allen Hightower,
D-Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   All, save the late Kubiak, are eligible to begin collecting
retirement money. Stiles just made it, turning 50 on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Also heading into legislative retirement is Lt. Gov. Bob
Bullock, whose state employment stretches back to his 1957 election
to the House.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, who as the state's No. 2 elected official gets the same
$600 a month that lawmakers receive, has selected a retirement plan
package that provides $58,597 a year, according to his office.
</P>
<P>
   For Bullock and other veteran legislative players, legislative
compensation has long been a tricky issue. The Legislature meets in
regular session every other year for only 140 days. A 1989 effort
to boost the salary to about $22,000 a year went down in flames at
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   So legislators still rely on the retirement plan to, eventually,
augment their salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Session after session,'' said Public Citizen's Smith, ``we
find special retirement packages buried in bills at the end of the
session.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Rep. Buzz Robnett, R-Lubbock, won late-night approval
for an amendment that lowered from 55 to 50 the age at which an
ex-lawmaker with eight years on the job can becomes eligible for
retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Robnett, now a lobbyist, retired after the session, at age 51.
</P>
<P>
   After taking some public heat for engineering the self-serving
change, Robnett declared, ``I'm at peace with myself because
legislators go through a lot and deserve it.''

 &HT;    Health officials make over-the-Web Viagra prescriptions
punishable
 &HT;    By Seth Mnookin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Concerned about the danger of Web sites that
offer Viagra prescriptions without any face-to-face doctor-patient
contact, the state's Board of Medicine said that doctors who
prescribe the drug online could face criminal prosecution or board
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have at least a basic history and physical and an
impotence workup,'' said Dr. Abraham Woods, a Lake Mary urologist
and member of the board. ``This is clearly not an issue you want to
treat lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   The area of Internet prescriptions is so new that the board had
never before discussed setting rules for the issue, but the board
made it clear that they frown upon online Viagra prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem, board members said, is that doctors who
prescribe over the Internet know very little about the patient.
Woods said some patients may be impotent as a result of diabetes or
elevated testosterone levels, and therefore Viagra would not be
appropriate. Also, taking Viagra in conjunction with heart medicine
can be extremely dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need follow-up and care, he said. ``You can't just put a
person on medication and leave them out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Prescribing medication without a license is illegal. However,
the board said Friday it is unclear whether a doctor practicing
outside the state needs to have a Florida license to prescribe
medication to a Florida patient.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to set some guidelines, board members said that
regardless of where a doctor practices, he must follow industry
standards when prescribing Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   ``It clearly is the standard of care at least for the initial
prescription that a physical is needed,'' said Dr. Gary Winchester,
a Tallahassee-based board member.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who fail to follow these standards face board
discipline, including suspension and revocation of license.
</P>
<P>
   A board task force will meet Friday to discuss telemedicine, and
the board directed them to specifically examine Internet
prescriptions at that meeting.

   STRIKES _ ATLANTA _ Despite a state law that demands mandatory
prison time for the type of crime probationer Timothy Carl Dawson
committed in 1995, a judge ordered probation. Dawson is now
suspected of killing five people _ four of them in hotel rooms. And
there are at least another 49 like him, probationers who would be
in jail but somehow have avoided the 10-year prison term demanded
by the Georgia Sentencing Reform Act, better known as the state's
``two-strikes-and-you're out'' law. ``I simply cannot understand
why any judge, who is sworn to uphold the law, won't follow it when
it's plainly written in black and white,'' said Gov. Zell Miller,
the architect of the law. (Cook, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

MICROSOFT'S CLEARTYPE SETS OFF DEBATE ON ORIGINALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One evening last month at an impromptu gathering of reporters at
the Comdex computer trade show, Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft
Corp., enthusiastically described a breakthrough technology for
improving the readability of text on the flat-panel color displays
used on laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
   The new technique, which he said would be added to Microsoft's
Windows operating system next year, is known as Cleartype, and it
makes text on a portable computer almost as readable as a newspaper
or a book, Gates asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Such an advance could be the key to shifting the balance from
text on paper to computer screens, he added, helping to popularize
electronic books and making online publications legible enough to
read directly from a computer screen for long periods without eye
strain.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that Cleartype represents a crucial step in the
evolution of the information age and could mean an economic bonanza
for the computer, Internet and publishing industries.
</P>
<P>
   But Gates' portrayal of the underlying technology as a Microsoft
innovation has set off an intense debate among some computer
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The company says Cleartype is the result of work done by Bill
Hill, a Microsoft researcher who joined Gates on stage for the Las
Vegas introduction of the technology last month. Hill, the company
says, discovered a fundamental new approach to rendering type by
inventing algorithms that draw upon the basic physics of human
vision.
</P>
<P>
   But within hours of the introduction, the Internet was buzzing
with claims that Cleartype was suspiciously similar to approaches
developed many years earlier by researchers at Apple Computer, IBM,
Xerox Corp. and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting that Microsoft intentionally violated the
patent rights of any other company or individual. The major reason
for the industry's fascination is that the issue speaks to a theme
that winds through the government's landmark antitrust case against
Microsoft now being tried in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony by executives of Netscape Communications Corp. and
Sun Microsystems Inc., Microsoft has been portrayed as a
high-technology opportunist that often copies and absorbs the
innovations of other, smaller companies but seldom invents much on
its own.
</P>
<P>
   That perception is not new. Despite spending almost $3 billion a
year on research and development, Microsoft is frequently portrayed
as a company distinguished by its ability to capitalize on the
ideas of others.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Microsoft became the giant of the industry by purchasing
another company's operating system and licensing it to IBM for its
first personal computer. And Gates once defended Microsoft from
accusations that his company borrowed the look and feel of the
Windows operating system from Apple's Macintosh by insisting that
both companies borrowed a graphical interface pioneered at Xerox's
legendary Palo Alto Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, Microsoft insists that ``the techniques
we've developed are significantly different than the claims for
prior art of which we're aware,'' said Dick Brass, a Microsoft vice
president for technology development who is leading the company's
electronic-book development.
</P>
<P>
   But John Seeley Brown, director of the Palo Alto Research
Center, is one of a group of researchers who do not see it that
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have found a minor twist,'' Brown said, ``but the
idea of how the eye perceives color based on the display of
sub-pixels is where we started this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has refused to disclose details about Cleartype,
saying it did not want to compromise the patent protection it
seeks.
</P>
<P>
   During his impromptu Comdex chat with reporters, though, Gates
divulged that Hill and a small group of Microsoft researchers had
been able to take advantage of the fact that on a liquid crystal
display, or LCD, each picture element, or pixel, consists of three
separate sub-pixels, of different colors. When all three are
switched on simultaneously, the viewer is tricked into seeing a
single white pixel because the individual sub-pixels are too tiny
for the eye to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   This means that LCDs should be able to render type fonts as much
as three times the actual screen resolution, making them far
sharper and easier to read.
</P>
<P>
   The stairstep edges of lines on a typical computer screen give
fonts a jagged appearance, so smoothing type has long been a quest
of software designers. Most settle for one of a variety of
techniques known as anti-aliasing or hinting. The most common
technique is to paint pixels along a character's edge in shades of
gray, which essentially smudges the characters' borders to make
them appear less jagged.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says its sub-pixel approach is ``an unprecedented
innovation in font display technology'' and Gates called it a
``leap forward'' in screen sharpness.
</P>
<P>
   Other industry researchers acknowledge that the Cleartype
technology will make screens sharper, but insist that the
underlying concepts have been known for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that I objected to is they made such a big deal out
of it,'' said Steve Gibson, a software developer who wrote programs
for the Apple II personal computer. ``I'm afraid they are going to
try to claim it as their own.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gibson decided to stake his own claim to history by creating a
Web page (http://grc.com/cleartype.htm) to document what he calls
the original pioneering work in sub-pixel technology by Steven
Wozniak, designer of the Apple II computer.
</P>
<P>
   Though Wozniak was designing for television screens rather than
for LCD displays, he used a sub-pixel technology to effectively
double the horizontal resolution of the Apple II by blending two
sub-pixels, purple and green.
</P>
<P>
   Wozniak, who now teaches school in Los Gatos, Calif., recalled
in an e-mail interview that the concept ``was actually quite
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my greatest contributions to the first low-cost
computers,'' he wrote, ``was to realize that these properties of
color equaling screen position allowed me to achieve color and
hi-res both, at very low cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Wozniak the only designer to explore color's
relationship with resolution. In 1989, Ronald Feigenblatt, an IBM
expert on LCDs, wrote a technical paper on using color to increase
the resolution of graphical objects, including fonts.
</P>
<P>
   Feigenblatt, who has since left IBM, said that at an academic
conference that year, IBM demonstrated a prototype flat-panel
display using software he had designed that used color sub-pixels
to enhance resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Brass said that neither the work of Feigenblatt nor that of
Wozniak had any bearing on Cleartype's development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wozniak patent deals with improving the display of a TV
set receiving an Apple II signal, and the Feigenblatt patent deals
with improving the rendition of color on an early LCD,'' he said.
``Neither of these technologies is about improving font resolution
on a display.''
</P>
<P>
   The most direct challenge to Microsoft's claim of originality,
however, comes from Dpix Inc., a Xerox subsidiary spun off from the
Palo Alto Research Center. Dpix makes a high-resolution, 7
million-pixel color flat-panel display using techniques that seem
to closely parallel Cleartype technology.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dpix display each pixel is composed of four sub-pixels _
two green and two red-and-blue _ to increase the readability of the
fonts above and beyond the resolution of the screen, which is
already twice that of today's standard flat panels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We address the green pixel separately with different
gray-scale data, which gives you a much finer resolution to the
font and a much finer curve,'' said Malcolm Thompson, president of
Dpix and a longtime flat-panel researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said his company had not sought a software patent
because such techniques had been used for many years in military
flat-panel displays for enhancing photographic imaging.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was not aware of the Xerox research, Brass said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's application for patent protection for its font
technology is one reason the announcement has stirred controversy.
Software was not routinely patented until the mid-to-late 1980s, so
the Patent Office does not have a rich database on which to draw
when assessing software claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built the whole industry around there not being patents,''
said Dan Bricklin, a developer who invented the spreadsheet. ``The
old-timers don't even think of patenting ideas new-timers think
they invented. It's a real mess.''

<P>
   A Watershed Year for Sex
</P>
<P>
   What with matters Lewinsky and the Viagra sensation, 1998 has
been a watershed year for sex, in the view of Rufus Griscom,
editor-in-chief of the online magazine Nerve (www.nerve.com).
Previously unutterable topics have infiltrated public discourse,
and this can only be good news to someone in the business of
offering readers ``literate smut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tom Brokaw says `erectile dysfunction' on the air, when
puritanism is pushed back, it's permanent,'' Griscom said.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, at the onset of a holiday season that many have
proclaimed an ``e-Christmas,'' Griscom feels that his magazine's
foray into electronic commerce is well timed. As with its stories
and essays, which have been contributed by established authors like
Erica Jong, Nerve's online store leaves much to the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone asks us, `Are you selling lotions and sex toys?'''
Griscom said. ``We clearly, very intentionally, decided not to do
that.'' Instead, there are provocative gifts like silk pajamas and
candles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps it should come as no surprise that apple pie is the
scent American males find most arousing. If you're not the sort to
bake your man a pie (or whisk your woman off to an ocean bluff),
put our aromatherapy candles to work for you,'' reads the
promotional copy for the ``Nerve Boutique: Supplies for the
Thoughtful Hedonist.''
</P>
<P>
   But pushing for a renaissance of the game Twister _ ``people
should get their limbs entwined with other people's limbs as often
as possible'' _ is just one facet of Griscom's efforts to extend
the 18-month-old Nerve brand.
</P>
<P>
   In raising money and signing deals, Griscom (who has a scholarly
demeanor and an Ivy League degree) has learned that perhaps even
more than love, sex is vastly misunderstood _ particularly when the
word ``intelligent'' is used to describe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is not to turn people on but to make people think
about it,'' he said. ``Erotica tends to follow the arc of the
sexual act and is more about arousal, whereas what we tend to
publish is more thoughtful and might make people feel decidedly
unaroused.''
</P>
<P>
   In this paradox, Griscom finds an intriguing challenge for the
new millennium, a time in which e-mail and chat rooms factor
increasingly into the romantic lives of a great number of people.
To accommodate the shift, the site will soon allow the creation of
personal home pages, the better to swap personal data and one's own
erotic writings.
</P>
<P>
   A television show is also possible, and a book _ ``Nerve:
Literate Smut'' _ is already on the stands.
</P>

<P>
   From the Electronic Innards to the Everyday Cash Register
</P>
<P>
   Is the Cisco brand moving to a store shelf near you?
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly the impression that John Chambers, chief
executive of Cisco Systems, gave last week. After speaking at the
president's electronic commerce news conference in Washington on
Monday, Chambers said his company, the No. 1 manufacturer of data
communications equipment, was seriously considering ways to move
into the retail consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking to the Panasonics and Sonys of the world,'' he
said.

   A vast majority of Cisco's business is selling products to other
businesses. But as high-speed data communications become available
to more people through cable modems and the telephone wire
technology known as DSL, a market opportunity may open to Cisco in
selling directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, most people who use an advanced data service get their
modem-like device directly from the company that provides the
service, with few choices _ similar to the way the cellular
telephone market operated years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in the wireless market, people can often choose their
phone first and their service provider second. And if a similar
evolution occurs in the high-speed data market, Cisco wants to be
there.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Panasonics and the Sonys, Chambers said, Cisco is
preparing itself for the day when advanced communications
capabilities are built into consumer electronics of all sorts.
Cisco would love the makers of VCRs and cameras, for instance, to
point out that their products include Cisco technology, just as
some PC makers boast of ``Intel inside.''

odyssey from New York to Hollywood. It is a testament not only to

   LAYOFFS-NEWSTYLE (Indianapolis) _ Plant closings and layoffs are
rising sharply again. The cutbacks announced recently at Bankers
Trust and Boeing are only the latest examples. But the outcries and
conflict that characterized the waves of downsizing in the 1980s

other jobs. By Louis Uchitelle. (With photo, graphic.)

Ovitz has returned to the job he knows so well: overseeing the

AMAZON REPORTED READY TO LINK TO OTHER MERCHANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the rapidly expanding online store, is about to
introduce a new service in which it will refer its customers to
other Internet merchants selling goods that it does not carry,
according to people briefed by the company on the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com plans to place links marked ``Shop the Web''
throughout its online store early next week, these people said.
This will allow consumers to search for items in a number of
categories including apparel, toys, computers and travel.
</P>
<P>
   Such a search would display items from a selection of
participating vendors. The vendors include some mainstream
merchants, like L.L. Bean, the Gap and F.A.O. Schwarz, as well as
some Internet-only merchants like Brainplay.com, a high-end
Internet toy store.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Amazon.com declined to comment on its specific
plans. But she said the company had made no secret of its intention
to introduce such a service since it bought a company called
Junglee in August. Junglee has created software enabling Internet
users to compare the prices and features of products for sale on
any number of sites spread across the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon has been moving at a breakneck pace to transform itself
from its original business as an online bookstore into something
closer to an electronic department store. It started selling music
last summer and then last month introduced videos and a gift
section with toys, consumer electronics and games.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Shop the Web'' service, using Junglee, is still
somewhat of a test, the people briefed on the plan said. At first
the link promoting the service will be placed in an unobtrusive
place on each page. After the initial bugs are worked out, Amazon
intends to create a button shaped like an index tab on the top of
all of its pages, referring shoppers to other sources of books,
music, movies and gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The intention is primarily to help consumers find items that
Amazon itself does not stock. But with the Junglee capabilities,
there may very well be instances of Amazon's steering customers to
other vendors or better prices of goods that the company has on
hand.
</P>
<P>
   But Amazon would still receive revenue in such cases. Initially,
the participating online merchants will pay Amazon a fee for each
customer who clicks on a link provided by the service to visit
their site. Eventually, they may be required to give Amazon a
percentage of each sale.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Amazon users who surf off to other online stores by
using the referral service may be able to buy things using Amazon's
one-click purchasing system, which stores customers' shipping
addresses and credit card information.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is quite a race on by a number of Internet
companies to combine shopping directories with services that make
buying items faster and easier. For example, the Excite search and
portal service has introduced a holiday gift shop with 300 items
drawn from about 20 online merchants. Excite offers to keep a
user's address and credit card information on file and send it to
each merchant that a customer buys goods from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like Excite creates a massive, searchable index of Web
sites, Excite will create a massive searchable database of products
available online,'' said Andrew Halliday, Excite's vice president
for electronic commerce.

FEAR AND LOATHING IN HOLLYWOOD: OVITZ IS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ He's back _ and not too many people here are happy
about it.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the talent agency business three years ago for a
troubled odyssey as a top executive in Walt Disney Co. and then as
a Broadway theatrical mogul, Michael Ovitz has returned to the job
he knows so well: overseeing the careers of movie stars.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz's return to Hollywood is expected to be announced in the
next few weeks with the start of a new company, Artists Management
Group, that will seek to manage movie stars, directors and writers.
Ovitz has said privately that the company, which has already lured
several young managers and agents from other companies, is part of
an overall plan involving sports franchises, entertainment, the
Internet and the computer business.
</P>
<P>
   But across Hollywood _ where memories of Ovitz's sometimes
abrasive tactics as chairman of Creative Artists Agency are
recalled with an undercurrent of nervousness and hostility among
even agents at his former company _ the return of one of
Hollywood's top power brokers has been greeted with an unmistakable
chill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is floundering a little, and he's using the clients and
clout of these young managers to get back into the mainstream,''
said Tom Ross, the former top music agent at Creative Artists who
worked for Ovitz for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is he coming back? He wants to be Michael Ovitz again,''
said Bernie Brillstein, a top talent manager who has tangled with
Ovitz over the years. ``He wants to reinvent himself.''
</P>
<P>
   No one underestimates the shrewdness and inventiveness of Ovitz,
whose severance package from Disney reached an extraordinary $100
million. But in returning to the Hollywood fray he may find a
somewhat altered landscape. His new firm represents one bona fide
star, Leonardo DiCaprio, and, perhaps, Cameron Diaz, but the young
managers and former agents who have joined Ovitz do not represent
the kind of A-list stars that bring in $15 million or $20 million a
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Few Hollywood moguls have left such a trail of enmity. Some of
the biggest names in town _ like David Geffen and Jeffrey
Katzenberg, two of the owners of Dreamworks, as well as Ron Meyer,
who runs Universal Studios for Seagram Co. _ barely speak to Ovitz.
Michael Eisner, the Disney chairman who dismissed Ovitz as his No.
2, has frosty relations with him. And the formerly warm
relationship between Ovitz and Edgar Bronfman Jr., chief executive
at Seagram, has chilled.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, several of Ovitz's former partners at Creative
Artists, like Meyer, as well as some of the top agents there and at
other big agencies, like International Creative Management and
William Morris, express mistrust and anger, albeit privately, at
what they view as his high-handed treatment of them in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Agents, movie executives and lawyers say Ovitz is coming into
the management field less from a position of strength and more on
the basis of his formidable reputation. Moreover, the degree of ill
will toward him among some agents and studio executives may
actually hurt Ovitz _ he will not be granted too many favors, said
several agents. On the other hand, even his foes at companies like
Dreamworks or Universal Studios would probably fall over themselves
to sign up DiCaprio to a new movie.
</P>
<P>
   Why Ovitz, who had ambitions to emerge as a player on Wall
Street and Madison Avenue, is returning to Hollywood, is a subject
of intense speculation here.
</P>
<P>
   A top entertainment industry lawyer, who has dealt with Ovitz
for years, said: ``Mike Ovitz has realized that his power emanates
from the world of Hollywood, the world of movie stars. If he
doesn't have this connection, he's just another guy with a lot of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz declined to comment, partly because legal issues involving
the signing of his top managers have not been fully sorted out.
</P>
<P>
   Across Hollywood, Ovitz remains not only a source of some
mystery and fear _ he is a masterful handler of the Hollywood press
_ but a figure with an extraordinary track record who transformed
the talent agency business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the representation business he built with some other
smart and talented executives at CAA, there's certainly every
reason to think he'll be equally successful in the management
business,'' said Brad Grey, whose management and production
company, Brillstein-Grey, representing television and film stars,
as well as writers, is one that Ovitz is probably seeking to
somewhat emulate.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz's move into the management field not only worries rival
managers but especially concerns top agents all over town.
Virtually every top agent interviewed expressed plenty of anxiety
about two issues: One is that Ovitz would seek to poach on their
agency _ and try to hire star agents for his new company. More
important, the agents worry that Ovitz will seek to lure movie
stars and directors from their talent agencies, including the one
he helped start, Creative Artists. In doing so, Ovitz, as a
manager, would essentially declare war on talent agents.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Ovitz's decision to launch Artists Management
Group _ as opposed to another talent agency _ underlines the
proliferation of managers in Hollywood in the last few years, a
relatively new phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Actors used to be represented solely by talent agents, but many
now retain managers as well (together with lawyers and public
relations representatives, too). Taking 10 percent to 15 percent of
a client's fees, a manager often works with an agent to shape
careers and oversee projects.
</P>
<P>
   But there are lines drawn between managers and agents. Managers
are, essentially, unregulated by law. They are often given producer
credits and films and television shows for their star clients,
sometimes earning hefty sums in the process. But they are
ostensibly barred from actually negotiating employment contracts
for clients. Agents, on the other hand, earn their fees negotiating
contracts. They are, however, barred from producing movies or
television shows.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In his venture, Ovitz will serve as a majority owner with his
prize hire, Rick Yorn, a fast-stepping, aggressively ambitious
30-year-old manager, whose clients include DiCaprio and Ms. Diaz.
But Yorn and his sister-in-law, Julie Silverman Yorn, also a
manager, have yet to work out their contracts from their current
employer, Industry Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, Ovitz's efforts to urge Yorn to break his
contract with Industry Entertainment, which is owned by Interpublic
Group of Cos., have outraged executives there. ``We've been
betrayed,'' said one top manager at Industry Entertainment, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. Yorn did not respond to phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   The Yorns bring in a generally youthful list of actors,
including Claire Danes, Matt Dillon, Geena Davis and Samuel L.
Jackson. Ovitz has also sought to enlist two former clients, the
directors Barry Levinson and Sydney Pollack. One rival agent said
Ovitz's efforts to bring in former clients like Dustin Hoffman and
Warren Beatty had failed so far.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Ovitz left the powerhouse Creative Artists
Agency, which he founded with several partners, to take the No. 2
job at Disney. At the time Ovitz made it clear that, after more
than two decades as an agent, he loathed the hand-holding,
late-night calls and temper tantrums of movie star clients. By all
accounts, Ovitz, who was already wealthy, also yearned to move into
the financial big leagues of corporate moguls.
</P>
<P>
   Only one year later, Eisner, Disney's chairman, ousted Ovitz
from a job whose severance reached an extraordinary $100 million.
Despite the financial bonanza, it was, for Ovitz, a humiliating
fall that left him shaken. His most high-profile deal since then
has been a $20 million investment in Livent Inc., the Broadway
theater company.
</P>
<P>
   That investment has almost disappeared. Six months after Ovitz
took over Livent, the company filed for bankruptcy-law protection.
Ovitz and his team filed a lawsuit against the company's founders,
Garth Drabinsky, and his partner, Myron Gottlieb.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit contended that the two men had misled Ovitz by
hiding the fact that the company was losing millions of dollars on
its expensive productions of musicals like ``Ragtime'' and
``Showboat.'' Drabinsky filed his own lawsuit against Ovitz and
other Livent executives charging that they had acted together ``in
a conspiracy to injure him.''
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Ovitz has formed a group aggressively pursuing
a National Football League franchise for the Los Angeles area in
the city of Carson. The proposal includes such glitzy backers as
his former clients, the actors Tom Cruise and Kevin Costner, and
the basketball figures Magic Johnson, Shaquille O'Neal and Jerry
West.
</P>
<P>
   But Ovitz's past is plainly haunting him as he embarks on
another chapter of his formidable show business career. ``Times
have changed,'' said Brillstein, the talent manager. ``But as far
as I know, Mike Ovitz hasn't won any popularity contests lately.''

`STOP KISS': COMIC IN SPIRIT, SERIOUS AT HEART 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS.: Production notes are at the end of the review.) 
(js) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Manhattan growls like an underfed pit bull in ``Stop
Kiss,'' a sweet, sad and enchantingly sincere play by the young
American writer Diana Son. The sirens, the horns, the tattoos beat
by unknown hands and feet on doors and floors: the sounds of the
city are edged in threats, signs of violence that has happened or
is waiting to happen. Yet it's all so irresistibly exciting, isn't
it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I love ... New York,'' says one character, newly arrived
there. The pause in her declaration suggests that she was intending
to finish the sentence with someone's name, but the substitution of
the city works nicely. In this delicately balanced comic drama,
which opened Sunday night at the Joseph Papp Public Theater,
falling in love with New York or in New York is risky. Only the
brave need apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop Kiss'' has probably generated the warmest advance word of
mouth of any downtown production this season. Only two days into
previews, it had sold 85 percent of the tickets for its five-week
run, which has been extended to Jan. 3, and it is easy to
understand why. As directed by Jo Bonney, with a fine cast led by
the wonderful Jessica Hecht, the production captures the heady
feelings of falling hard for a less than cuddly metropolis in ways
that musicals and plays like ``Wonderful Town'' and ``Barefoot in
the Park'' must have for other generations. But this particular
valentine comes equipped with warning lights. The problems of urban
living aren't just cute and eccentric here, though it might seem
that way when the evening begins. Cutting back and forth in time,
before and after a random act of violence that is the work's
center, the production generates an underlying ominousness in even
its lightest moments, so that toward its end, the clatter of
dropped silverware in a coffee shop generates disproportionate
unease.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. This story of a charmingly unfocused radio traffic
reporter named Callie (Ms. Hecht) and her friendship with Sara
(Sandra Oh), a schoolteacher from St. Louis, is also a gentle,
affectionate work, with a blithe sense of comedy that brings to
mind early episodes of ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show.'' Imagine Rhoda
and Mary slowly discovering that they are physically attracted to
each other, and you'll know what I mean.
</P>
<P>
   The breezy comic spirit doesn't trivialize the play's underlying
gravity. Only a few of the jokes or one-liners, such as a sideswipe
at Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, seem to exist for their own sake. Ms.
Son, who is 32, presumably grew up with television, like most
American children. To say that the impact shows is not an insult.
</P>
<P>
   She is able to transform sitcom situations, which were mostly
appropriated from boulevard plays to begin with, back into the
stuff of theater. The surface ease of ``Stop Kiss'' is belied by
its emotional and thematic continuity; images and ideas are linked
without calling didactic attention to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   You may have heard that ``Stop Kiss'' is about gay-bashing,
which isn't quite right. The signal event in the play is indeed the
brutal beating of a young woman after she is seen kissing another
woman. What Ms. Son does, however, is slyly place the occurrence in
the context of a larger consideration of the perils of living life
fully. Making choices and commitments is a scary business, ``Stop
Kiss'' suggests, but what is the alternative?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The play's heroine hasn't committed to anything when we meet
her. Callie, who is hovering around 30, came to New York as a
university student and has stayed on, fairly contentedly but
passively, showing initiative only in the selection of restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   She presents her job, surveying traffic patterns from a
helicopter for a radio station, as something to make fun of. She
and her longtime boyfriend, George (Kevin Carroll), sleep with
other people, but ``will probably get married,'' she says. The
rent-controlled apartment where she has lived for many years
(envisioned with pitch-perfect squalor by the set designer Narelle
Sissons) is still mostly unfurnished, with stacks of newspapers as
its most prominent decorative accent.
</P>
<P>
   This description, which brings to mind the perpetual adolescents
of television shows like ``Friends'' and ``Seinfeld,'' may make you
wish you could switch channels. But that only means you haven't
seen what Ms. Hecht can do with a part like this. As she
demonstrated in Christopher Kyle's ``Plunge'' last season, this
actress, who brings to mind the young Sandy Dennis without the
post-nasal drip, finds symphonic shadings in ambivalence and the
short attention span.
</P>
<P>
   Here, she creates a portrait of someone who has made a defense
system out of being easily distracted, the idea being that if you
don't focus, you won't want things too badly. Watch how Ms. Hecht's
eyes are suddenly arrested, in mid-conversation, by an article in a
newspaper, randomly spread on the floor, or the gentle bobbing of a
cat's wire toy. Listen to how her voice slides, like a virtuoso
skater, away from self-revelations. As someone else says of her,
she has a tendency, in all things, to ``swerve.''
</P>
<P>
   This observation is made, in a delightfully drunken moment, by
Sara, the Midwesterner who, against her parents' and boyfriend's
wishes, has come to New York to work with third-grade public school
students in the Bronx. Unlike Callie, Sara is strongly focused and
alarmingly unafraid, to the point that she feels compelled to
answer beggars and harassers on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the women meet, it's clear that they share a sense of
humor and a whimsy that borders on the precious and might be less
appealing in the hands of two other actresses. Ms. Oh's Sara mixes
wryness with enthusiasm, and she has a nifty way of dropping her
voice into a low register to punctuate the ends of her sentences.
Ms. Oh doesn't have Ms. Hecht's variety or fluidness, but the
actresses balance each other well.
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble is rounded out by four other performers, all
excellent. The magnetically casual Carroll and the deliberately
self-conscious Rick Holmes, as the respective men in Callie's and
Sara's lives, are perfect contrasts that further define these
women, and the play wisely doesn't dismiss the complexity or appeal
of these earlier romantic relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Saundra McClain is dead on as both a bourgeois witness to a
crime and a Caribbean hospital nurse. Saul Stein, in the evening's
only thankless part, does what he has to as the detective who
questions Callie after Sara is beaten senseless.
</P>
<P>
   These scenes of interrogation are spliced early into the
continuing narrative of Callie's and Sara's mutual sentimental
education, and they are initially a brutal contrast to the rest of
the play. Yet as staged by Ms. Bonney, with the enriching
assistance of James Vermeulen's lighting and especially David Van
Tieghem's sound effects and music, the production never loses its
sense of the connections between the lightness and the darkness,
which are weaved seamlessly in Ms. Son's script.
</P>
<P>
   It is also impossible to imagine a better tour guide through
this uncertain landscape than Ms. Hecht. Callie is asked throughout
the play, as it seesaws in time, to make the sort of whiplash
emotional transitions that could cause nosebleeds. Ms. Hecht never
strips gears and never seems less than fully committed to each
moment. Her ability to embrace unlikely extremes matches that of
the play, and it's what makes ``Stop Kiss'' considerably more than
a sitcom with a conscience.

 &HT;    Reporting minor crimes skews data outcome

<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Grand Junction Police Chief Gary Konzak
raised some eyebrows when he said last week that Grand Junction has
one of the highest crime rates in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Federal crime statistics prove him right.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Junction in 1996 had the third-highest crime rate in
Colorado among cities with more than 10,000 people, according to
the FBI's statistical abstract, Crime in the United States. In
1996, the latest year with available figures, Grand Junction had
100 crimes per 1,000 people. Commerce City, a Denver suburb with
18,500 people, had 105, and Montrose had 104.
</P>
<P>
   To tabulate the total number of crimes committed in a given
area, the FBI compiles the total number of crimes classified as
murder, manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault,
burglary, larceny and theft and motor vehicle theft.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Junction police Lt. Robert Knight said the way the police
department reports the crimes may give the city a bad rap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We encourage people to report all crimes, from petty theft to
murder,'' Knight said. ``The down side of that is it makes the
crime statistics look a little bit ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight said larger cities such as Denver often don't report
smaller thefts like shoplifting a pack of cigarettes, whereas a
smaller police force like Grand Junction includes such a theft in
its crime statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Cobley, a training instructor for the FBI in Denver,
said it's a problem that occurs in all areas of law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Cobley and Knight said much of Grand Junction's drug arrests
come because of its location on Interstate 70, a major
cross-country highway. Grand Junction's role as the commercial hub
for the Western Slope adds to the movement of people in and out of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Knight said the city aggressively targets suspected drug
runners, raising the number of arruri and Trinity County, Calif.,
as Y2K friendly.
</P>
<P>
   A Y2K-friendly area is described as being some distance from a
major metropolitan area, having milder winters and moderate summers
and ``safe'' from major known hazards, such as earthquakes and
nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Other pages focus on what a family needs to be prepared should a
computer catastrophe hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Noah's Ark Homesite, for instance, offers everything from
how to organize a 72-hour survival kit to details about long-term
storage and water purification.
</P>
<P>
   The storage of food and water is not new in Western culture.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has for at least
50 years encouraged church members to keep a supply of food and
water on hand to take care of the family for at least a year in
case of emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church has not taken a position relative to the year 2000
but has always suggested to members to provide at least one year's
supply of food and water,'' said Grand Junction LDS West Stake
President Jerry Chadwick. ``Not for a catastrophe but for
emergencies that may come along, if you lose a job. But if the
computers refuse to function after awhile, a year's supply of food
and water would be welcome. ... Members would certainly share with
the neighbors around us if that need should arise.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Heard the latest management mantra? Six Sigma.
</P>
<P>
   In consultant-speak, it denotes the path to a corporate nirvana
where everything _ from product design to manufacturing to billing
_ proceeds without a hitch. In engineer-speak, it means no more
than 3.4 defects per million widgets or procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, Six Sigma is a statistical quality-control method
that combines the art of the efficiency expert with the science of
the computer geek. And a growing group of big no-nonsense companies
like Allied Signal, Motorola and General Electric swear by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six Sigma has galvanized our company with an intensity the
likes of which I have never seen in my 40 years at GE,'' said John
Welch, chairman of General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   So fervent a proselytizer is Welch that GE has spent three years
and more than $1 billion to convert all of its divisions to the Six
Sigma faith. The GE Medical Systems unit recently introduced a
$1.25 million diagnostic scanner, the first product that GE
designed from start to finish using Six Sigma principles. Six Sigma
teamwork enabled GE Plastics to produce 1.1 billion pounds more
plastics without building one new plant. Over all, Welch credits
Six Sigma with raising the company's operating profit margins to
16.6 percent from 14.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly is this philosophy of flawlessness? First, the
name. Sigma is the Greek letter that statisticians use to define a
standard deviation from a bell curve. The higher the sigma, the
fewer the deviations from the norm _ or, in industry parlance, the
fewer the defects. At One Sigma, two-thirds of whatever is being
measured falls within the curve. Two Sigma encompasses about 95
percent. At Six Sigma you are about as close to flaw free as mere
mortals can get.
</P>
<P>
   No company can really achieve that kind of perfection, of
course. But as with any religion, Six Sigma presents an ideal state
toward which adherents continually strive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six Sigma gets people away from thinking that 96 percent is
good, to thinking that 40,000 failures per million is bad,'' said
James Morehouse, a vice president of the consulting firm of A.T.
Kearney Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Six Sigma was developed more than a decade ago at Motorola. But
since then, it has been embraced by numerous corporations and is
even included in courses on quality at the Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   As applied in industry, Six Sigma is a rigorous statistical
method of breaking a customer's requirements into tasks or steps,
and setting the optimum specification for each part of the process,
based on how the parts interact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six Sigma translates fuzzy customer requirements into
technically measurable responses,'' said Maurice Berryman, a Six
Sigma consultant in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Here is an example: Say a customer wants to be billed on the
same day each month. With Six Sigma, making that happen means
analyzing the interaction of everything involved in processing that
customer's order.
</P>
<P>
   When and how does the sales department send through paperwork,
and at what point does a difference in days, hours, even minutes,
have an impact on when the bill goes out? Does it make a difference
when shipping coordinates with billing? How long does mail sit in
the mail room, and at what point does it matter?
</P>
<P>
   Once everything is quantified, the what-if scenarios begin:
Would a stricter paperwork processing schedule in sales make mail
room bottlenecks irrelevant? Would adding a person in accounting
give the mail room an extra hour's leeway?
</P>
<P>
   In principle, Six Sigma is little different from the type of
analysis that Frederick Taylor, the industrial efficiency pioneer,
might have performed with stopwatch and notebook a century ago. But
in Six Sigma analyses, there are thousands of permutations and
combinations _ probably too many for the human mind to fathom,
although easy enough for even a moderately speedy computer. Thus,
modern information technology has made Six Sigma a practical way to
identify the optimum configuration of most products or processes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six Sigma gets people from all over the organization to work
together on improving the end product, not just their individual
piece of it,'' said Frank Jones, a Six Sigma specialist at the
management consulting firm Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the new GE Medical Systems product _ a superfast
diagnostic scanner called the Lightspeed _ 200 people spent nearly
three years and almost $50 million to run 250 separate Six Sigma
analyses. While one team was checking out the reliability of
measurement devices, another was figuring out which factors affect
the scanner's life, while yet another was dissecting image quality
into factors that could be massaged to filter out picture-blurring
electronic noise.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightspeed, like many diagnostic scanners, employs computed
tomography, or CT. CT scanners work by sending electromagnetic
waves through the body and recording the amount of energy that
comes out. Since various tissues and organs absorb energy
differently _ bones absorb more than flesh, for example _ the
emerging waves, in the form of light, yield a good picture of the
internal landscape they have passed through. The scanners let
doctors study wafer-thin cross sections of parts or all of a
patient's body without making any incision.
</P>
<P>
   GE Medical Systems, which already controls 39 percent of the
$1.6 billion global market for scanners, has high hopes for the
Lightspeed. The new scanner captures multiple images
simultaneously, requiring only 20 seconds to do full-body scans
that once took three minutes _ important because patients must
remain perfectly still during the scan. And unlike previous CT
scanners, the Lightspeed does not need to cool down for as long as
three minutes between uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speed is breathtaking, and it ran without downtime from
the start,'' said Dr. Carl Ravin, chairman of the department of
radiology at Duke Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightspeed is not perfect, of course. But Six Sigma enabled
GE Medical to anticipate which compromises doctors would accept.
For example, the Lightspeed takes slightly thicker scan slices than
doctors normally specify, but no one complained because the thicker
slices were virtually free of electronic noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six Sigma let us predict the amount of variability that
customers will tolerate before they perceive it as a defect,'' said
Marc Onetto, who oversees Six Sigma projects at Gems, as GE Medical
Systems is commonly known.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Six Sigma itself is not perfect, either, since it
cannot compensate for human error. Take what happened when Gems
tinkered with the computer that translates the data the scanner
collects into images an operator can read.
</P>
<P>
   CT scanners generate a lot of heat, and the heat often caused
the printed circuit boards to overload. A Six Sigma team figured
out that by perforating the metal box that holds the boards, they
could dissipate the heat. They were right _ except that they forgot
to check what other impact that change might have.
</P>
<P>
   Gems started sending out scanners with perforated computer
boxes. The holes compromised the structural integrity of the metal,
the metal warped outward and the circuit boards loosened _ causing
as many failures as the heat had.
</P>
<P>
   Gems technicians spotted the problem during field tests, and the
company corrected it by reinforcing the metal before any scanner
was running at a hospital or a clinic. But the mistake taught Gems
an important lesson about Six Sigma.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must take it step by step,'' said Charles Young, a Gems
spokesman who has been steeped in the process. ``You get into
trouble if you compromise the rigor of the process. You can't skip
steps and jump to premature conclusions.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Lightspeed project started, as so many new products do, with
customers clamoring for more, better, faster.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1995, Gems knew that Siemens, Toshiba and other
competitors were working on faster scanners. The company also knew
it could probably get its own faster version ready, approved by the
Food and Drug Administration and on the market before the 1998
Radiology Society of North America show, the annual December trade
exposition at which the medical equipment industry displays its
latest wares. But readying a scanner as radically different as the
Lightspeed was an iffier proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going for that quantum leap in technology in that time frame
was one of the toughest decisions of my career,'' said Vivek Paul,
general manager of the CT business at Gems. ``We shifted
development resources from existing products, and that left us very
vulnerable if Lightspeed couldn't be built in time.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, the race against the clock began.
</P>
<P>
   The most important parts of the scanner are the tubes, which
focus the waves, and the detector, which translates them into
pictures. So they received the heaviest attention.
</P>
<P>
   The old tubes, which cost $59,000 each to replace, had long been
a thorn in GE's side. Hospitals and clinics wanted them to operate
for at least 12 hours a day, for 6 months; typically, they lasted
only half that long. Moreover, Gems was scrapping some $20 million
in tubes each year because they failed preshipping performance
tests. Even so, a disturbing number of faulty tubes were slipping
past inspection, only to be pronounced dead-on-arrival _ Gems
really does call them DOAs _ at the customer's door.
</P>
<P>
   So the Gems Six Sigma teams deconstructed the tubes. They knew
that one problem involved the petroleum-based oil in the tube,
which prevents short circuits by isolating the anode, which has a
positive charge, from the negatively charged cathode. The oil often
deteriorated after a few months, but they did not know why. By
using statistical what-if scenarios on all parts of the tube,
however, the researchers learned that the lead-based paint on the
inside of the tube was adulterating the oil. By November 1996 they
had developed a paint that would preserve the oil and protect the
tube.
</P>
<P>
   CT scanners generate X-rays by bombarding metals with high-speed
electrons. Even a few air molecules can slow the electrons down, so
the tube needs a total vacuum. But too many tubes were reaching the
end of the production line with ``beads'' _ tiny openings, usually
where glass and metal are sealed, that let air leak in.
</P>
<P>
   So Gems engineers made a list of things that could cause a
vacuum leak. Through Six Sigma analysis, they ruled out type and
length of glass. But they did learn that the metal pin through
which current flows into the tube tended to tarnish, which would
loosen the seal. They also found other significant factors: the
type of gas used in processing the tube, and the speed with which
the glass cooled down after going through a heat-treating furnace.
</P>
<P>
   Thus informed, the engineers used computer modeling to test
numerous combinations of different temperatures, gases and such.
They wound up ``pre-oxidizing'' the metal pin, roughening its
surface and helping it adhere to the glass. They replaced the
hydrogen gas with nitrogen. And they changed the heating process
from one in which tubes move continuously through the furnace to
one in which they are processed in fixed batches, making the
heating and cooling periods easier to control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six Sigma gave us a methodical way to test how changes in one
factor would interact with changes in others,'' said Beth Hulse,
the engineer who led the project.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to eliminate all leaks would have put Gems way behind
deadline and way over budget. And it was now early 1997. So Gems
settled for a process that cut the pre-shipment scrap rate by 40
percent and that has eliminated DOAs so far. And while the new
tubes are priced at $85,000, or 40 percent more, they carry a
one-year warranty.
</P>
<P>
   Converting an electron beam to X-ray images is not an efficient
process. Only about 1 percent of the energy that hits human tissue
emerges as light, with the rest dissipated as heat. And that heat
can affect the quality of the image.
</P>
<P>
   Statistical analysis showed that adding a $100,000 resistor
would control the temperature. But the same tests also revealed
that changing a few inexpensive capacitors elsewhere in the tube,
and redesigning how the wires are padded, would yield a similar
result.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to cut down on fuzzy images and false readings _
detection of tumors that are not really there, for example _ would
have been to tighten the specifications for the focal point, the
accuracy with which the electron beam hits the target tissue. But
that would have involved a costly tube redesign.
</P>
<P>
   By April 1997, a Six Sigma team had learned that widening the
tungsten wires that cover many of the wave-receptor cells in the
detector plate would create a bigger target, thereby compensating
for any tiny inaccuracies in the beam's trajectory. Although this
change requires giving the patient a higher dose of X-rays during
the scan, the dose is still within the medically accepted margin of
safety. ``By making the data collection process less efficient, we
made the scanner as a whole more efficient,'' said Gary Strong, a
Lightspeed designer.
</P>
<P>
   But the image quality still needed improvement. The detector
surface in each scanner has thousands of ``pre-amp chips,''
semiconductor components that amplify the light signals so that a
computer can read them. But each chip emits some energy itself,
which in turn gets picked up by other chips, causing extraneous
rings or shadows in the image.
</P>
<P>
   Redesigning the chips, Gems concluded, would take at least eight
months, which could mean missing the target date for field tests:
April 1998. But Six Sigma analyses showed that Gems could get the
same result by relaxing specifications for the relationship between
the amount of energy that comes into and out of the pre-amps, and
by writing simple software that would allow the computer to control
the variation. The project was completed last March _ just before
the deadline for the field tests.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightspeed, which went on the market in September, costs 25
percent more than older scanners but seems to be a hit. Gems has
installed 12 Lightspeeds, and has orders for 50 more.
</P>
<P>
   But the Six Sigma work at Gems is far from over. The Gems chief
executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, is working on projects to find a
better way to position flexible tabs _ the items that keep
electrons in alignment as they travel across the detection panels.
And he will soon join a team that will apply Six Sigma methods to
reduce variances in customer service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six Sigma lets you approach problems with the assumption that
there's a data-oriented, tangible fix at the end,'' Immelt said.
``And that is a radical culture change.''

 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last week, the first lady came to town to light the
five and a half miles of lights stapled to the branches of the
Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, and while she was in Manhattan
she also electrified a clutch of the town's media executives. It
was a most worthwhile schmooze for all involved.
</P>
<P>
   During a week when she appeared on the cover of Vogue's December
issue _ the first time a first lady has done so _ Hillary Rodham
Clinton swept through the media world, having lunch with editors
from Time, Teen People and People magazine on Tuesday, greeting a
table of Vogue editors at breakfast on Wednesday, and delivering a
15-minute oration in praise of Harvey Weinstein and his media
company, Miramax Films, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   You will be reading more about Mrs. Clinton very soon: Newsweek
and Time magazines are working on profiles of the first lady for
the end of the year, and she is under consideration by Time to be
its Person of the Year, although that will depend on how the
impeachment proceedings of Bill Clinton are resolved. (If he is
impeached, she will not be considered; if he is not, she will be.)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's visit demonstrated the fact that magazine editors
need famous faces to generate a little heat and light for their
publications. They can feed off the prestige of the first lady
while she uses them as a vehicle to support her favorite causes.
And it also showed that at least in the case of Weinstein, a
generous campaign contributor, the principle of the favor bank is
alive and well in the world of media, as it is in the political
arena.
</P>
<P>
   She called him ``my friend Harvey.'' And he said she was ``the
first lady of all our hearts.'' (Gwyneth Paltrow, however, was the
first lady of Miramax, Weinstein said.)
</P>
<P>
   Carl Sferrazza Anthony, a biographer of first ladies, said Mrs.
Clinton had only recently begun to deal with the media in a way
that was both shrewd and yet comfortable for her. For example, the
Vogue cover article _ something coveted but never attained by Nancy
Reagan _ would not have been possible until this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As she has become more comfortable with the reality that she
has been made into a symbol upon which everyone can write all of
their frustrations and aspirations, and she has accepted this
creation of her as a symbol, she has become more comfortable with
the media,'' Anthony said. ``And thus more comfortable with the
lengthier and more in-depth kind of story that a magazine would
do.''
</P>
<P>
   By sitting for the cover of Vogue, Mrs. Clinton generated a
storm of international press so thick that the Vogue publicity
department sent it out in a binder. Anna Wintour, editor in chief
Vogue, said the magazine sold 900,000 newsstand copies of the
October issue, which featured Oprah Winfrey as its gamine cover
model; Ms. Wintour expects that Mrs. Clinton's cover will exceed
the Winfrey cover in newsstand sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press hit way before the issue was out, and now we can
only keep our fingers crossed,'' Ms. Wintour said.
</P>
<P>
   And Vogue, a Conde Nast publication, validated Mrs. Clinton in a
way that no other venue could: The article, written by the
historian Ann Douglas, scarcely touches on the Monica Lewinsky
debacle, choosing as its frame Mrs. Clinton's devotion to historic
preservation. Mrs. Clinton gets to appear on the cover of a fashion
magazine in a velvet dress, looking self-assured and _ perhaps most
important _ well-coiffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have seen it as a vindication for her, that being on
the cover of Vogue is beyond power and politics,'' Ms. Wintour
said. ``It proves in a way that she is a woman of stature and an
icon to American women.''
</P>
<P>
   Score: Vogue, one. Mrs. Clinton, one.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton spoke at a lunch given by Ann Moore,
president of the People division of Time Warner, and Patricia
Fili-Krushel, president of the ABC Television Network. Mrs. Clinton
sparked waves of murmurs as she walked into the room with her Vogue
makeover: She wore a slate-gray suit, a cluster of glittering red
beads twisted around her neck, and her hair was smooth and
straight, in the same sleek, I-will-survive hairstyle that Princess
Diana adopted in the pages of Harper's Bazaar after her divorce
from Prince Charles.
</P>
<P>
   The lunch was ostensibly to celebrate Mrs. Clinton's work with
the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, but Mrs. Clinton _
standing at a podium emblazoned with the bright blue Teen People
logo before a bank of news camera crews _ praised Teen People ``and
its 10 million readers'' for the magazine's articles on teen-age
celibacy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, in turn, got to gather a roomful of influential
people in broadcast news (like Lesley Stahl, Barbara Walters and
the entire cast of ABC's midmorning talk show for women, ``The
View'') and print (Time's managing editor, Walter Isaacson, and
editors from every major Time Inc. magazine and Hearst Magazines'
Ladies Home Journal) and ask them to send the message of teen-age
celibacy to readers. She also urged Ms. Fili-Krushel to infuse the
plots of ABC network shows with the same message. After lunch,
everyone was given a bag with a coffee mug, a reprinted article
about teen-age pregnancy from Teen People wrapped in a shot of a
dreamily gazing Leonardo DiCaprio, and a copy of Mrs. Clinton's
book ``It Takes a Village.''
</P>
<P>
   Score: Teen People, one. Mrs. Clinton, one.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Thursday evening, Mrs. Clinton walked into the Ziegfeld
theater for the premiere of the Miramax film ``Shakespeare in
Love'' on the arm of Weinstein, who is co-chairman of Miramax with
his brother, Bob, and is a generous contributor to the Democratic
Party and the Clinton Legal Expense Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton further earned the devotion of Weinstein. As the
first lady walked to the stage, a thousand folding movie theater
seats simultaneously flipped up for an ovation, with a noise that
sounded like a flock of large sea birds taking off. She delivered a
speech praising the 20-year history of Miramax, and spoke about how
much she and the president enjoy watching Miramax movies in the
White House screening room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvey and Bob have really given us a lot of pleasure,'' she
said. ``They've raised the bar for excellence.'' She spoke about
the ``buzz'' behind Miramax movies and media ventures, and said the
Miramax company ``has done a great service.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein blushed like a newlywed.
</P>
<P>
   Score: Mrs. Clinton, one. Miramax, one.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony, the biographer, said Mrs. Clinton had learned to be at
ease with the press over the last six years. When the couple first
arrived at the White House, he said it was not a personal priority
for her to get attention from the magazine world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's a matter of maybe acquiescing more, in rounding out
the picture of being first lady,'' he said. ``I think she's
realized that there is a halfway point.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Maybe the willingness to do a Vogue article is not
so much a compromise to some traditional role of first lady, but a
way of complying with the traditional expectations, yet still
managing to do it in her own way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Douglas, the author of the Vogue profile, said she was
surprised by the article's eventual status as the cover piece. Ms.
Wintour had not initially intended the article that way, and by
late summer, Ms. Douglas had assumed that Vogue would cancel the
piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the scandal heated up, I assumed it was dropped,'' Ms.
Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the opposite happened. Ms. Wintour thought the
Lewinsky affair made the article more important.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Douglas pointed out that the cover was especially successful
in light of the Democratic Party's gains in the November elections
.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just think how she would have looked on the cover of Vogue if
the Democrats had lost,'' Ms. Douglas said. ``My original title for
the piece was `The Triumph of Hillary Clinton.' And they didn't go
with that. But putting her on the cover said it anyway.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Years ago, when his media empire consisted of little more than
an Atlanta television station, Ted Turner was so widely considered
a self-promoting parvenu that critics called him the Mouth of the
South. So when Turner, now vice chairman of Time Warner Inc.,
announced late last year that he planned to donate $1 billion to
the United Nations over the next decade, many wondered if the
philanthropic gesture would turn out to be all talk.
</P>
<P>
   By Turner's own calculus, the contribution was to come in annual
gifts of $100 million for 10 years. And as 1998 nears its end, he
concedes that his contribution so far _ $75 million in the form of
roughly 1 million shares of Time Warner stock _ has fallen a bit
short of the target. But he said in a telephone interview last week
that setting up the money pipeline had taken longer than expected,
and that now that it was in place, he planned to increase the flow
rate and make up the difference by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the United Nations is not complaining, having already
committed $55 million from Turner's largess to projects that
include fighting polio around the world and helping to keep
HIV-infected pregnant women from transmitting the AIDS virus to
their unborn children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We announced our first round of grants in May and the second
in September,'' said Jennifer Lee DeLaurentis, head of the U.N.
office overseeing the gifts. ``We are very pleased with the volume
and quality of projects approved thus far.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, 60, has become increasingly active as a philanthropist
in recent years. ``Everybody gives,'' he said, ``except Rupert and
Sumner.'' He was referring, half in jest, to two titans of the
media industry, Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp., and Sumner
Redstone, chairman of Viacom &UR;  &LR; Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Redstone declined to comment. A Murdoch family spokesman said
the Murdochs regularly donated to all sorts of charities.
</P>
<P>
   The Turner U.N. gifts are administered by the U.N. Foundation,
which Turner set up after announcing his plan in September 1997.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Taylor Glover, Turner's financial adviser, said that it had been
fairly complicated to start giving away the money. Not only did
Turner have to set up the new foundation, but the United Nations
itself created an entity, the U.N. International Partnership Trust
Fund, to receive the gifts. The two foundations were not in place
until last February.
</P>
<P>
   David Harwood, chief of staff of the U.N. Foundation, said that
he, like Turner, expected the rate of giving to accelerate in the
coming year. And Glover noted that Turner already had placed an
additional 1.6 million shares of Time Warner stock, worth roughly
$100 million, into a charitable remainder trust, which can be used
as needed in coming years to meet the foundation's U.N. obligation.
Meanwhile, Turner can receive income from the trust.
</P>
<P>
   Already, both the foundation and the trust fund have sold their
Time Warner shares to lock in gains in the stock's price, which has
risen 67.8 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, since Turner announced his intention to give
to the United Nations, his ability to do so has sharply increased.
In September 1997, his 58 million shares of Time Warner stock were
trading at $55.375 each, giving him a net worth of $3.2 billion.
Although he now has 54 million shares, their value is about $5.72
billion. The stock closed Friday at $106.06
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Foundation remains separate from the Turner Foundation,
which is based in Atlanta and run by Turner; his wife, Jane Fonda,
and Turner's five children. That foundation gave away $26 million
this year. Turner also gave Ms. Fonda $10 million to establish a
foundation of her own.

<TEXT>
<P>
   One evening last month at an impromptu gathering of reporters at
the Comdex computer trade show, Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft
Corp., enthusiastically described a breakthrough technology for
improving the readability of text on the flat-panel color displays
used on laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
   The new technique, which he said would be added to Microsoft's
Windows operating system next year, is known as Cleartype, and it
makes text on a portable computer almost as readable as a newspaper
or a book, Gates asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Such an advance could be the key to shifting the balance from
text on paper to computer screens, he added, helping to popularize
electronic books and making online publications legible enough to
read directly from a computer screen for long periods without eye
strain.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that Cleartype represents a crucial step in the
evolution of the information age and could mean an economic bonanza
for the computer, Internet and publishing industries.
</P>
<P>
   But Gates' portrayal of the underlying technology as a Microsoft
innovation has set off an intense debate among some computer
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The company says Cleartype is the result of work done by Bill
Hill, a Microsoft researcher who joined Gates on stage for the Las
Vegas introduction of the technology last month. Hill, the company
says, discovered a fundamental new approach to rendering type by
inventing algorithms that draw upon the basic physics of human
vision.
</P>
<P>
   But within hours of the introduction, the Internet was buzzing
with claims that Cleartype was suspiciously similar to approaches
developed many years earlier by researchers at Apple Computer, IBM,
Xerox Corp. and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting that Microsoft intentionally violated the
patent rights of any other company or individual. The major reason
for the industry's fascination is that the issue speaks to a theme
that winds through the government's landmark antitrust case against
Microsoft now being tried in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony by executives of Netscape Communications Corp. and
Sun Microsystems Inc., Microsoft has been portrayed as a
high-technology opportunist that often copies and absorbs the
innovations of other, smaller companies but seldom invents much on
its own.
</P>
<P>
   That perception is not new. Despite spending almost $3 billion a
year on research and development, Microsoft is frequently portrayed
as a company distinguished by its ability to capitalize on the
ideas of others.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Microsoft became the giant of the industry by purchasing
another company's operating system and licensing it to IBM for its
first personal computer. And Gates once defended Microsoft from
accusations that his company borrowed the look and feel of the
Windows operating system from Apple's Macintosh by insisting that
both companies borrowed a graphical interface pioneered at Xerox's
legendary Palo Alto Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, Microsoft insists that ``the techniques
we've developed are significantly different than the claims for
prior art of which we're aware,'' said Dick Brass, a Microsoft vice
president for technology development who is leading the company's
electronic-book development.
</P>
<P>
   But John Seeley Brown, director of the Palo Alto Research
Center, is one of a group of researchers who do not see it that
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have found a minor twist,'' Brown said, ``but the
idea of how the eye perceives color based on the display of
sub-pixels is where we started this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has refused to disclose details about Cleartype,
saying it did not want to compromise the patent protection it
seeks.
</P>
<P>
   During his impromptu Comdex chat with reporters, though, Gates
divulged that Hill and a small group of Microsoft researchers had
been able to take advantage of the fact that on a liquid crystal
display, or LCD, each picture element, or pixel, consists of three
separate sub-pixels, of different colors. When all three are
switched on simultaneously, the viewer is tricked into seeing a
single white pixel because the individual sub-pixels are too tiny
for the eye to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   This means that LCDs should be able to render type fonts as much
as three times the actual screen resolution, making them far
sharper and easier to read.
</P>
<P>
   The stairstep edges of lines on a typical computer screen give
fonts a jagged appearance, so smoothing type has long been a quest
of software designers. Most settle for one of a variety of
techniques known as anti-aliasing or hinting. The most common
technique is to paint pixels along a character's edge in shades of
gray, which essentially smudges the characters' borders to make
them appear less jagged.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says its sub-pixel approach is ``an unprecedented
innovation in font display technology'' and Gates called it a
``leap forward'' in screen sharpness.
</P>
<P>
   Other industry researchers acknowledge that the Cleartype
technology will make screens sharper, but insist that the
underlying concepts have been known for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that I objected to is they made such a big deal out
of it,'' said Steve Gibson, a software developer who wrote programs
for the Apple II personal computer. ``I'm afraid they are going to
try to claim it as their own.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gibson decided to stake his own claim to history by creating a
Web page (http://grc.com/cleartype.htm) to document what he calls
the original pioneering work in sub-pixel technology by Steven
Wozniak, designer of the Apple II computer.
</P>
<P>
   Though Wozniak was designing for television screens rather than
for LCD displays, he used a sub-pixel technology to effectively
double the horizontal resolution of the Apple II by blending two
sub-pixels, purple and green.
</P>
<P>
   Wozniak, who now teaches school in Los Gatos, Calif., recalled
in an e-mail interview that the concept ``was actually quite
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my greatest contributions to the first low-cost
computers,'' he wrote, ``was to realize that these properties of
color equaling screen position allowed me to achieve color and
hi-res both, at very low cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Wozniak the only designer to explore color's
relationship with resolution. In 1989, Ronald Feigenblatt, an IBM
expert on LCDs, wrote a technical paper on using color to increase
the resolution of graphical objects, including fonts.
</P>
<P>
   Feigenblatt, who has since left IBM, said that at an academic
conference that year, IBM demonstrated a prototype flat-panel
display using software he had designed that used color sub-pixels
to enhance resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Brass said that neither the work of Feigenblatt nor that of
Wozniak had any bearing on Cleartype's development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wozniak patent deals with improving the display of a TV
set receiving an Apple II signal, and the Feigenblatt patent deals
with improving the rendition of color on an early LCD,'' he said.
``Neither of these technologies is about improving font resolution
on a display.''
</P>
<P>
   The most direct challenge to Microsoft's claim of originality,
however, comes from Dpix Inc., a Xerox subsidiary spun off from the
Palo Alto Research Center. Dpix makes a high-resolution, 7
million-pixel color flat-panel display using techniques that seem
to closely parallel Cleartype technology.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dpix display each pixel is composed of four sub-pixels _
two green and two red-and-blue _ to increase the readability of the
fonts above and beyond the resolution of the screen, which is
already twice that of today's standard flat panels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We address the green pixel separately with different
gray-scale data, which gives you a much finer resolution to the
font and a much finer curve,'' said Malcolm Thompson, president of
Dpix and a longtime flat-panel researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said his company had not sought a software patent
because such techniques had been used for many years in military
flat-panel displays for enhancing photographic imaging.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was not aware of the Xerox research, Brass said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's application for patent protection for its font
technology is one reason the announcement has stirred controversy.
Software was not routinely patented until the mid-to-late 1980s, so
the Patent Office does not have a rich database on which to draw
when assessing software claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built the whole industry around there not being patents,''
said Dan Bricklin, a developer who invented the spreadsheet. ``The
old-timers don't even think of patenting ideas new-timers think
they invented. It's a real mess.''

MICROSOFT SETS PUSH FOR CORPORATE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft Corp., put the matter
succinctly while speaking in New York last week. The next
battleground for the personal computer industry, he said, is
industrial-strength corporate computing _ the lucrative province of
hardware and software suppliers like IBM, Sun Microsystems and
Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of that battle, according to Gates, is not much in
doubt. He spoke of the supremacy of the ``PC model'' _ hardware and
software as separate businesses (Microsoft, of course, dominates
the software side). ``The PC model will take over the rest of the
industry,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   The personal computer forces, led by Microsoft, are already
moving up the computing food chain from their desktop stronghold.
In the last couple of years, Microsoft's hub software for feeding
information to and from many users at once _ called Windows NT
Server _ has captured the market for corporate networks that span a
few hundred desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Microsoft has not really cracked the sizable market for
heavy-duty computing chores, like securities trading or travel
reservations systems, in which workers typically use powerful work
stations running Unix software or terminals connected to mainframe
computers. The standards of performance, availability and
reliability for these systems, which must handle millions or
billions of transactions a day, have been regarded as beyond
Microsoft's reach.
</P>
<P>
   That assumption, however, may be challenged by an announcement
planned for Monday that the Nasdaq stock market intends to move one
of its key systems from a mainframe onto a cluster of powerful PC
server computers, running Windows NT. The system monitors trading
and feeds the data to Nasdaq's in-house regulators and, if
necessary, to the Securities and Exchange Commission. It tracks
trades as they occur and crunches the data to spot trades that
appear to be errors or suspicious _ and must recognize them within
90 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq has decided to move its market-monitoring system off its
Tandem Computers mainframe mainly because its proprietary software
tended to make the system inflexible, said Gregor Bailar, chief
information officer of the National Association of Securities
Dealers Inc. To analyze fast-moving markets and the proliferation
of new securities, he explained, Nasdaq felt it needed a more open
technology in which many third-party developers were making
software tools for the securities industry.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq took bids from both Unix and Windows NT suppliers, and
Bailar said he had some qualms whether Windows NT would be up to
the task. ``This is a mission-critical system for us, and I wanted
to be convinced,'' Bailar said. The leading Windows NT proposal was
put through 30 different benchmarking tests, including handling up
to 4 billion daily transactions. ``I was a bit surprised by NT's
performance,'' Bailar said.
</P>
<P>
   David Osborne, chief technology officer for Micro Modeling
Associates, the lead consultant on the project, predicts that
Nasdaq's move will attract a lot of attention on Wall Street. Many
Wall Street firms use Windows NT as a desktop operating system,
said Osborne, whose consultancy works for many investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the major Wall Street firms have been watching closely to
see if Windows NT is really going to work on the server side for
big, high-transaction systems,'' he said. ``The Nasdaq project is a
bellwether for NT.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, industry analysts note that winning a single showcase
project, like the one at Nasdaq, scarcely means that the markets
for large Unix systems and mainframes are facing an imminent threat
of Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a notable milestone for NT, but it has a long way to
go before it is widely deployed across the top tier of corporate
computing uses,'' observed Dwight Davis, an analyst for Summit
Strategies, a research firm.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even Microsoft, which has been criticized in the industry for
making inflated claims about Windows NT, which was introduced in
1993, is speaking carefully these days. ``We're not saying there
isn't a lot more work to be done at the high end, but we've come a
long way,'' said Edmund Muth, marketing manager for the Microsoft
group responsible for so-called enterprise, or corporatewide,
customer networks. ``In that context, the Nasdaq project is
directional.''
</P>
<P>
   In the server business, Microsoft is pursuing its tried-and-true
formula of focusing first on the high-volume, less-costly end of
the market as its launching pad. From there, it gathers a primary
community of users, software developers, resellers and consultants
_ and moves up toward higher tiers of the corporate computing
market.
</P>
<P>
   Last year for the first time, for example, computer systems
running Windows NT Server software passed Unix server systems in
terms of units sold worldwide, according to International Data
Corp., a market research firm. In the first half of this year, IDC
reported that sales of server machines running Windows NT reached
472,505, compared with 258,320 for all Unix suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   When measured by revenue, however, the Unix leadership in
heavy-duty corporate computing remains intact. In the first half of
1998, sales of Unix servers were $11.6 billion, compared with $3.3
billion for server machines running Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   At the upper end of corporate computing, a supplier's services
and skills often matter as much or more than the cost of hardware
and software. And increased competition has brought sharp declines
in the price of large Unix systems and mainframes. One result is
that even the mainframe, once seen as a technological dinosaur and
a corporate albatross for IBM, has made a comeback.

SCOTTISH POWER TO PURCHASE PACIFICORP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (js) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scottish Power PLC is expected to announce Monday that it is
buying Pacificorp, a major provider of power in the Northwest, for
$7.5 billion in stock, people close to the talks said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction, which must be approved by U.S. regulators,
would be the first purchase of an entire U.S. utility by a foreign
company and could lead to more acquisitions of U.S. companies by
foreign concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, whose final terms were being negotiated Sunday,
Pacificorp stockholders would receive one Scottish Power American
Depository Receipt worth $25.25 for every Pacificorp share, a
premium of 21.7 percent to Pacificorp's closing price of $20.75 a
share on Friday. Pacificorp stockholders will have about 36 percent
of the shares in the combined group.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will be based in Glasgow, Scotland, and will be
headed by Murray Stuart, chairman of Scottish Power, and Ian
Robinson, the company's chief executive. Pacificorp will be run as
a North American subsidiary of Scottish Power and is expected to be
run by the Pacificorp team currently in place, led by Keith
McKennon, the company's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The merged company would have almost 7 million customers in
Britain and the United States for its water, power, gas and
telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the talks said the deal came together quickly
and that the companies had been negotiating for a little more than
a month. The merger is a reversal of sorts for Pacificorp, which
was viewed as a potential buyer of a British utility earlier this
year but lost a bidding war for Energy Group PLC of Britain to
Texas Utilities Co. in August.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Fred Buckman resigned as chief executive of
Pacificorp and the company said it would abandon its global
expansion plans and sell almost all its assets aside from its
electric utility business in the West. Its subsidiaries, Pacific
Power and Light and Utah Power and Light, operate in nine Western
states. The company also owns an Australian utility, Powercor.
</P>
<P>
   Pacificorp's earnings have slid in recent years, partly because
of the costs of its failed takeover efforts and volatile power
prices, which hurt results in its energy-trading business. Its
stock has fallen 24 percent this year and the company became the
subject of considerable takeover speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish Power has been interested in expanding into the U.S.
electricity market, which is opening to competition. It was
reported to have discussed buying Florida Progress Corp. and
Cinergy Corp., a Midwest utility based in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish Power officials have said their expertise in
deregulation gained in Britain could be used in the United States,
where deregulation in the utility business is behind that in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   It is thought that Scottish Power is being advised by Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter and that Pacficorp is being advised by Salomon
Smith Barney. &QL;

 &HT;    Water stocking picks up as year 2000 draws nearer

<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Someone walked into Deep Rock Crystal
Drop Water in Grand Junction recently, plopped down a couple
hundred dollars and left with enough packaged water to last a year.
</P>
<P>
   Company secretary Carolyn Mitchell said she had a feeling the
man had bought the water in preparation for the year 2000. He was a
new customer she had never seen before. And he wanted the water in
five gallon bottles but had to settle for 2.5-gallon boxes. She
said he estimated he would need five gallons a week.
</P>
<P>
   To some, that isn't even enough water to brush teeth.
</P>
<P>
   To others, though, the coming of the new millennium has provoked
a need to prepare for anything that might come along so storing any
water at all is a step in the right direction.

 &HT;    Atlanta considers ban on drive-throughs
 &HT;    By Alfred Charles
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Drive through windows could become a thing of
Atlanta's past starting today when the Atlanta City Council
considers a controversial ordinance that would ban the construction
of new drive-through windows in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, an effort to make the congested city more
pedestrian-friendly and reduce pollution, was introduced by
Councilman Lee Morris and narrowly survived a close vote last week
to make it out of committee.
</P>
<P>
   It has ignited a firestorm of criticism from motorists and
business groups who argue that the legislation is misguided.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a key member of the council said she believes the
measure _ which would affect everything from banks, fast food
restaurants and dry cleaners _ has enough council support to be
approved. It would need eight votes, and then two additional ones
to override a mayoral veto.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, permits for the construction of new drive-through
windows would not be issued. Existing ones could remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't keep building our communities around automobiles,''
said Morris, the Buckhead representative who proposed the idea five
months ago. ``We could the be the first of many more cities to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The town of Carrboro, N.C., recently banned drive-through
windows from its downtown to preserve the area's character. Cities
in California like Santa Monica and Burbank have imposed some
restrictions, but largely for aesthetic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   If Atlanta followed suit, it would be the first major American
city to do so. Morris' legislation would have a profound affect on
Atlanta drivers who, according to experts and recent published
reports, spend more time in their cars than any other metro area in
America, logging an average of 34 miles a day per car and $1.5
billion a year in fuel and time.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, some motorists are opposed to the Morris plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inconvenience and hardship that a drive-through ban would
impose on the average citizen, especially mothers with young
children, senior citizens and people with disabilities, would far
outweigh any benefit to the environment,'' said Martha Hunt, an
Avondale Estates resident who drives into Atlanta often.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has also come under sharp attack from industries
that would be hit hard by the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will create havoc for a lot of businesses and the city will
lose revenue,'' said Robert King, president and chief executive
officer of the Georgia Hospitality &AMP; Travel Association, which
represents the Georgia Restaurant Association. ``The ordinance is
well-intentioned but misguided.''
</P>
<P>
   Some council members agreed, saying the move would stifle
business, especially in southwest Atlanta. ``I want more banks and
institutions that have drive-throughs in my area,'' Councilman Jim
Maddox said during last week's committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Debi Starnes, who usually votes against Morris on
most issues, said she supports his legislation because it would be
a significant step in cleaning up the city's polluted air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I encourage Mr. Morris to speak more passionately about it,''
she said. ``I believe it will pass.''
</P>
<P>
   In other matters, the council is expected to act on: legislation
that would impose a $1 surcharge on cellular phone use for Atlanta
customers, money that would be used for the 911 center; ask state
lawmakers to form a 2-year commission that would study allowing
pari-mutel betting and casino gambling, an effort to bring gaming
to Underground Atlanta; and new Civil Service policies for water
workers that will be affected by privatization.

NEW BASKETBALL LEAGUE IS THE ULTIMATE IN CORPORATE SPONSORSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fans who decry the creeping commercialization of sports, who
moan when they hear that the Micron PC Bowl will take place at Pro
Player Stadium, who shake their heads at brand logos on uniforms
have another reason to rant: a new men's basketball league has sold
team-naming rights to a company.
</P>
<P>
   The Collegiate Professional Basketball League, which plans to
begin play in November 1999 with eight teams in the Northeast and
Midwest, signed a three-year agreement with Lycos Inc., operator of
a popular Internet search engine (www.lycos.com), to sponsor a team
in Boston. The name says it all: Team Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   The league describes itself as the first professional American
sports league that will have all its teams named after corporate
sponsors. Heck, the league is even willing to name itself after a
company if one wants to buy those rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are becoming used to the idea that entertainment is
underwritten by sponsors, and sponsors put their names on things,''
said Paul McMann, president of the league in Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of our mission is being in the advertising business,'' he
added. ``We've always assumed that the CPBL will not make its money
at the gate, but from delivering eyeballs to advertisers who want
to get their messages in front of fans.'' The naming rights to a
second league team, in Chicago, will be sold soon, McMann said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lycos deal is worth about $1.2 million in cash and services
to the league. Lycos will help build a Web site (www.cpbl.com),
provide banner advertising and enable fans to send e-mail and buy
merchandise on line.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is emblematic of the growing presence of
interactive advertisers in mainstream marketing. The team naming
comes after Lycos began running its first national brand
advertising, created by Bozell Worldwide in New York, a unit of
True North Communications. The campaign includes commercials
likening the Web-searching abilities of Lycos to a Labrador
retriever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the power of having your name associated with a
team,'' said Jim Hoenscheid, promotion director at Lycos in
Waltham, Mass. ``We've had a tremendous amount of success with
building brand awareness through title sponsorships.'' Among
examples listed by Hoenscheid was a Team Lycos in a NASCAR auto
racing series.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball Team Lycos will be one of a handful of branded
team names in American sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leagues have to be cautious,'' said Sean Brenner, editor of
Team Marketing Report, a sports business publication in Chicago,
because ``fans can get upset.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the revenue potential becomes difficult to ignore,'' he
added, particularly as fans ``become anesthetized to the increasing
commercialization of sports, especially as it happens gradually.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Muller, president and chief executive at Muller Sports
Group in New York, said: ``Most teams are in need of money for
bigger stars, more stars,''. But, he added: ``I just don't see a
major sports league in America ever naming teams after sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the previous examples of teams selling naming rights
mostly involved sports outside the mainstream. They include the
Miami Hooters in arena football, named after the Hooters restaurant
chain; Team OP in beach volleyball, named after Ocean Pacific swim
wear, and the Detroit Neon in indoor soccer, named for the Neon
subcompact car sold by DaimlerChrysler AG.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most familiar example is the Colorado Silver
Bullets, a women's minor league baseball team sponsored by the
brewer of Coors Light beer, nicknamed ``the Silver Bullet.'' The
Coors Brewing Co., a unit of the Adolph Coors Co., sponsored the
team from 1993 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our contract came up, we made a decision not to renew our
sponsorship,'' said Lori A. Varsames, a spokeswoman for Coors
Brewing in Golden, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were proud of what we were able to do with the team,'' she
added, ``but it was a question of where our best sponsorship
opportunities were.'' For instance, Coors Brewing continues as the
naming sponsor of Coors Field, the home of the Colorado Rockies in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   After ending its sponsorship of the Silver Bullets, the brewer
allowed the team to retain the name.
</P>
<P>
   If Lycos decided to discontinue its sponsorship, would a Team
Lycos by any other name play as sweet?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have sponsors in a market changing every year, that
means the league would not be delivering good value,'' McMann said.
``I'm confident that won't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to help Lycos get to the point,'' he added, ``where
it has the same brand recognition as the New York Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   That was music to Hoenscheid's ears.
</P>
<P>
   ```The House that Lycos Built,''' he said, chuckling. ``There
you go.''

 ADRIEN BRODY WAITS ON STARDOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Nearly one year ago, Adrien Brody, a six-foot,
hazel-eyed actor, walked into Orso's restaurant in Los Angeles and
sat down at a table on the patio with his agent and a publicist to
talk about his budding career. He had just returned from six months
in Australia where he played one of the coveted roles in ``The Thin
Red Line,'' Terrence Malick's World War II epic that opens on Dec.
23 with an ensemble cast including Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, George
Clooney, Woody Harrelson and John Travolta.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen ninety-eight was shaping up as a pivotal year for
Brody, who would also have key roles in movies by Spike Lee and
Barry Levinson. By 1999 he would have a half-dozen movies in
release. Had Adrien Brody's moment arrived?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time to sit down and talk,'' said David Pollick, a
publicist whose agency also represents Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad
Pitt. ```The Thin Red Line' was going to be a big event picture.
Adrien's career was happening. Now was the time to focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Brody, 25, may or may not prove to be a star: His physical
appearance is hardly the conventional blond, blue-eyed Hollywood
handsome. He and his agents could make damaging decisions over the
next few years. And Malick recently called to tell him that he'd
had to trim back the actor's role during editing. But Brody's
odyssey from Queens to Hollywood is a testament not only to his raw
talent and persistence _ he aggressively pursued acting jobs from
the time he was 12 _ but also to the indefinable ways careers can
take shape in the movie business, sometimes in a flourish after
years of preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not surprise me if Adrien becomes a movie star,''
said Spike Lee, who cast him in ``Summer of Sam'' (due next year)
as a blond-mohawked punk rocker from an Italian neighborhood in the
Bronx who is accused of being the ``Son of Sam,'' who terrorized
New York City 20 years ago. (Leonardo DiCaprio originally agreed to
the role, then backed out). Levinson, who cast Brody as a Jewish
youth in 1950s Baltimore in ``Liberty Heights'' (also to be
released next year), said the actor ``had a sensibility and a
quality that's very interesting _ when he says the lines there's
something else going on all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily Variety, in a review three years ago of ``Ten Benny,'' an
independent film about a New Jersey shoe salesman, said the actor
``seems destined to become a star'' and that he ``displays the raw
instinctive talent of a young De Niro or Pacino.'' (Recently, the
trade paper compared him to European film stars like Jean-Louis
Barrault, Gerard Philippe and Vittorio Gassman.)
</P>
<P>
   Malick, who auditioned hundreds of actors for the role of Fife
in ``The Thin Red Line'' (a role based loosely on James Jones, who
wrote the autobiographical novel), told Dianne Crittenden, his
casting director, that Brody reminded him of Jean-Pierre Leaud, the
star of the Francois Truffaut classic ``The 400 Blows.''
</P>
<P>
   Like her peers, Ms. Crittenden first became aware of Brody in
Steven Soderbergh's ``King of the Hill'' (1993), a vivid
Depression-era drama in which he played a streetwise youth.
``Adrien has a wonderful face,'' said Ms. Crittenden. ``He just has
something _ you're mesmerized by him on the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, Pollick began sending magazine editors copies of
reviews for Brody in Daily Variety, hoping to boost his client's
image. He followed by talking up Brody's appearance in ``The Thin
Red Line,'' which has stirred considerable attention because it
marks the director's return to filmmaking after 20 years. The
result was a one-page photo layout on Brody in last month's Vanity
Fair, followed by a GQ magazine photo spread.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in Penn Station in Manhattan one recent Sunday, waiting
to board a Metroliner for Baltimore, where he is making ``Liberty
Heights,'' Brody could have been a graduate student en route to
Johns Hopkins. Removing his woolen cap, he revealed a 1950s style
crew cut. His backpack was filled with books. His narrow dark face,
all angles, was dominated by his nose. ``If I don't get parts,'' he
said with a grin, ``it's because they say I'm too ethnic-looking.''
On the train later, sipping bottled water, Brody was low key and a
bit nervous. ``It's like the quiet before the storm,'' he said.
``Like I have done this body of work, and I can do nothing now but
sit back and wait and see what the outcome is.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, by the end of 1999, Brody's life is sure
to be far different than it is today. His career has moved along
steadily, at times fitfully, like any other young actor able to
earn a relatively modest living at his craft. (Until this year, his
one windfall was $50,000 in residuals from the video sales of a
Disney movie, ``Angels in the Outfield.'') But what has set him
apart from other talented young actors is that casting agents in
New York and Los Angeles noticed him early on and kept him in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard 18 months ago that he was becoming flavor of the
month I was not at all surprised,'' said Todd Thaler, a New York
casting director who met Brody 10 years ago. ``Here was like this
beautiful kid with a big nose, this incredible face. He had a
wise-beyond-his-years quality. Like he seemed unself-conscious,
uninhibited. You meet some kids, and you just know.''
</P>
<P>
   Brody grew up in a blue-collar neighborhood in Woodhaven,
Queens, the only child of two arty parents. His mother, Sylvia
Plachy, is a well-known photographer who has worked for years for
The Village Voice. His father, Elliot Brody, a retired New York
City teacher, is a painter. At the age of five, he met a writer at
The Village Voice, Howard Smith, who showed him magic tricks. ``He
got feverishly interested in magic, and later he went to magic camp
in upstate New York,'' said Ms. Plachy. ``He loved performing at
birthday parties. Even if his tricks failed the kids loved him.''
</P>
<P>
   He started taking Saturday morning acting classes at the
American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Manhattan. An actress friend
who saw the 12-year-old perform suggested he try out for an agent,
Claudia Black, at the Harry Abrams Agency. He was promptly cast in
an Elizabeth Swados experimental work at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music, and then in an off-Broadway satire, ``Family Pride in the
50's,'' playing a working-class boy who wanted to be a ballet
dancer. ``There was no thinking about a career,'' said Brody's
father. ``It was a creative outlet for him. And he loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   At 13, he landed the starring role as an orphan in turn-of-the
century Nebraska in a PBS drama, ``Home at Last.'' The same year,
he was accepted as a drama major at the High School of Performing
Arts at Lincoln Center. At 15, he auditioned for Mary Tyler Moore
and was selected to play her step-son in the short-lived sitcom
``Annie McGuire.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was a turning point, and the family sat down to make a major
decision. The only way Adrien could take the job was if one of his
parents accompanied him to Los Angeles. His father took a leave
from his teaching job and found an apartment in Beverly Hills so
Adrien could attend Beverly Hills High School. It was the first
time he and his parents fully realized that he had the potential to
earn a living as an actor.
</P>
<P>
   But the show failed and Adrien returned to New York to graduate
from the La Guardia High School of Performing Arts. He enrolled at
the State University of New York at Stony Brook for a year but
switched to Queens College because it was too far to travel to New
York auditions. He dropped out after a semester to move to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Working in front of a camera, he said, came naturally to him.
``I grew up in front of a lens, my mother photographed me since I
was an infant, thousands of pictures,'' he said. ``So I feel very
comfortable in front of a camera, more comfortable than I am
onstage.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the physical changes of his teen years caused him career
problems for a while. He felt stymied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some painful discussions,'' said Deborah Aquila, now
senior vice president of features casting at Paramount and a
longtime casting director from New York. ``He was so young when he
started. He was a gangly teen-ager. It took time for him to fill
out and grow into the man he is now. I told him not to worry. What
mattered was his talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aquila had a major impact on Brody's career. She first cast
him as a mentally ill patient in a little-known 1991 film, ``The
Boy Who Cried Bitch.'' (Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times
that it was ``a more serious film than its terrible title
suggests''). Two years later Ms. Acquila urged Steven Soderbergh to
cast him in ``King of the Hill.'' ``Even as a teen-ager, Adrien had
an exceptional range of talent,'' said Ms. Aquila. ``And he's
extremely exciting to watch, very sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   Another major move, even before the Soderbergh film came out,
was to snag a Los Angeles agent with International Creative
Management, JoAnne Colonna, who has represented Jennifer Lopez,
Lukas Haas and Gena Rowlands. Ms. Colonna had met Brody at the
urging of her New York counterpart at a smaller talent agency when
she moved to Los Angeles. (Brody now speaks to Ms. Colonna every
day.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw in Adrien somebody who did not look like anybody else
out there,'' said Ms. Colonna, who recently joined a new management
company headed by Michael Ovitz. ``Here was this 18-year-old guy
from Queens who seemed like an old soul, who had a distinct
personality and had a lot of charisma.''
</P>
<P>
   By his early 20s Brody was living in a series of cheap Hollywood
apartments. But he was working steadily in independent films,
taking home about $900 a week, and beginning to catch the eye of
Hollywood executives. He played a Beat poet modeled after Allen
Ginsberg in ``The Last Time I Committed Suicide,'' a ``Jewish
homeboy who thinks he's black'' in ``Six Ways to Sunday.'' In
``Oxygen,'' he was a psychopath; in ``Restaurant,'' a struggling
playwright. (Several of the films are being released next year.)
</P>
<P>
   Pollick, senior vice president of the Baker Winokur Ryder
publicity firm, remembers being struck by Brody in ``Ten Benny''
(formerly called ``Nothing to Lose'') several years ago at the Los
Angeles Film Festival. He called Ms. Colonna, the agent. The young
actor could not yet afford a public relations man, but Pollick
offered to provide informal advice. In a sense, he was betting that
Brody's career would take off and he would soon need
representation. ``There's a point you've got to cultivate
relationships with young actors, and I saw something in Adrien that
I didn't see every day,'' said Pollick.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his progress, Brody was getting restless about his
career. ``It was steadily improving but there were no big movies or
big breaks,'' he said. ``I could never land a studio film because
they always went to the name actors. You know, `Get me Leonardo
DiCaprio or Matt Damon or somebody.' Or they wanted an all-American
type.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was picky, too, wanting to make independent films and
turning down television jobs, including the pilot of ``Northern
Exposure.'' Megan Branman, a top television casting director, said,
``I've been trying for several years to get him on every pilot that
calls for a guy in his 20s. He's not a pretty boy but he's got
enormous presence. You don't get tired looking at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Colonna, meanwhile, had read the script for ``The Thin Red
Line,'' and arranged a meeting with Malick. The conversation lasted
nearly two hours. ``We were at a hotel overlooking Central Park, we
were watching the skaters and the conversation just kind of flowed
_ about young people, about everything,'' recalled Brody.
``Finally, he said he'd like me in his movie, and I'm like, `Wow,
that's great!' But I've had other people tell me that and nothing
happened.'' Weeks later, Ms. Colonna called to say he had been cast
as Fife. ``I was blown away, I almost cried,'' said Brody.
</P>
<P>
   Then a New York agent at ICM, Aleen Keshishian, urged Spike Lee,
another client, to meet Brody after DiCaprio dropped out of
``Summer of Sam.'' The flamboyant role _ an Italian-American punk
rocker who strips in night clubs _ was eagerly sought by other
actors. Brody and the director met at a restaurant near Union
Square. Later he read for the director wearing spiked hair, jewelry
and a T-shirt depicting Robert DeNiro in a Mohawk.
</P>
<P>
   On the October night ``Summer of Sam'' completed filming in the
Bronx at 4 a.m., Brody returned to his hotel, slept till 10 a.m.,
caught a noon Metroliner for Baltimore, and started on ``Liberty
Heights.'' ``The part I play is a nice, sweet Jewish boy, very
normal, somewhat repressed _ I need some repression in my life at
this point.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor speaks to his parents every day. His father has
carefully invested his son's money. Brody plans to buy a sports car
since reluctantly giving up motorcycles after the frightening
accident on an East Hollywood street in 1993 that left him immobile
for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Brody, Ms. Colonna and Pollick say they're waiting
to see what happens. Colonna and Pollick are convinced their client
will soon emerge as a significant actor, if not a star. Brody says
he's nervous about the reaction to his three big studio films as
well as the smaller independent movies. But he has one priority,
once the money starts rolling in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to buy my mother a loft in SoHo and my father a big
stone house in upstate New York,'' he said.

   LAYOFFS ARE ON THE RISE, BUT WITHOUT PAST RANCOR
</P>
<P>
   Plant closings, layoffs and forced early retirements are rising
sharply again as evidenced by the cutbacks announced recently at
Bankers Trust, Boeing and Johnson &AMP; Johnson. But the outcries and
conflict that characterized the waves of downsizing in the 1980s
and early 1990s are largely gone. Rather than protest, unions are
more likely to help laid-off members make the transition to other
jobs. And corporate executives no longer call attention to
downsizing as healthy for profits and stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom, Europe's largest phone company, plans to cut
20,000 jobs, or 11 percent of its work force, by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   $7.5 BILLION DEAL SEEN FOR PACIFICORP
</P>
<P>
   Scottish Power PLC is expected to announce Monday that it is
buying Pacificorp, a major provider of power in the Northwest, for
$7.5 billion in stock, people close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. GIFT COMES UP SHORT FOR '98
</P>
<P>
   When Ted Turner, the vice chairman of Time Warner, announced
last year that he planned to donate $1 billion to the United
Nations over the next decade, he said the contribution was to come
in annual gifts of $100 million over 10 years. As 1998 nears its
end, he acknowledges that his contribution so far _ $75 million in
Time Warner stock _ has fallen short. But he said he planned to
make up the difference by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   WB EXECUTIVE CONSIDERS LEAVING
</P>
<P>
   Garth Ancier, the president for programming at WB, the growing
fifth network owned by Time Warner, said he would decide by the end
of this week whether to stay with the network or leave when his
contract ends in May.
</P>
<P>
   AMAZON.COM TO MAKE REFERRALS
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the online store, is about to introduce a service in
which it will refer its customers to other Internet merchants
selling goods that it does not carry, according to people briefed
by the company on the plan.
</P>
<P>
   NASDAQ TURNS TO POWER OF PCs
</P>
<P>
   The assumption that personal computers could not provide the
performance and reliability of mainframes may be challenged by an
announcement planned for Monday that the Nasdaq stock market
intends to move one of its key systems onto powerful PC server
computers running Microsoft's Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates' portrayal of technology for improving the
readability of text on flat-panel screens as a Microsoft innovation
has set off a debate among some researchers.
</P>
<P>
   PEDDLING `LITERATE SMUT' ON LINE
</P>
<P>
   The online magazine Nerve, which its editor says is in the
business of offering ``literate smut,'' is making a foray into
electronic commerce with gifts like silk pajamas and candles. The
magazine is also seeking to extend its brand name by pushing for a
renaissance of the game Twister.
</P>
<P>
   SPRINT EXPANDS INTEGRATED SERVICE

<P>
   Sprint intends to announce Monday that big-business customers

<P>
   So, in the interests &LR;  of creating a more perfect world for the
holidays, you want to whisper a sweet little something into your
honey's ear? Something, perhaps, in which you get across the
message that you don't like his nose hair, or that she ought to do

<P>
   Gentlehints.com ``stands ready to apprise these individuals in a

COMPANIES HESITANT TO SHARE YEAR 2000 INFORMATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ga., Ohio, Texas)  (rl) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal law aimed at encouraging businesses to share sensitive
information about year 2000 computer problems has produced scant
results in its first month and a half, according to corporate year
2000 specialists, consultants and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Congress rushed what it called a Good Samaritan law to President
Clinton this fall amid growing concerns that many computers and
software programs could malfunction if they interpret the two-digit
representation of the year _ 00 _ as 1900 or do not recognize it as
a valid year. Many trade groups, including those representing
electric utilities, airlines and the computer industry, have been
telling the government that fear of lawsuits has been stifling the
exchange of information that could help reduce the risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, collaboration is essential as time ticks away,'' said
Tim Morton, vice president at Electronic Data Systems Corp., who
oversees a Web site that his Dallas-based consulting and management
company has set up as a public forum where companies can report on
year 2000 issues.
</P>
<P>
   The new law is intended to make it much more difficult for
plaintiffs to attack companies, trade groups and other distributors
of year 2000 information, even if the information turns out to be
faulty or incomplete. Plaintiffs would have to prove that those
sharing the information knew it was wrong or were reckless about
whether it was truthful.
</P>
<P>
   The law does not bar fraud claims and does not cover sales
pitches to consumers. It also does not apply to pending lawsuits or
restrict the Securities and Exchange Commission's ability to ask
for year 2000 information and enforce its disclosure rules.
</P>
<P>
   The new law covers two types of information. The narrower
category, known as year 2000 readiness disclosures, deals only with
the year 2000 status of a company's own products and services. It
covers, for instance, any comments by the Boeing Corp. about its
aircraft and any advice from Citibank about whether consumers can
expect its automated teller machines to dispense cash.
</P>
<P>
   The other category, known as a year 2000 statement, is far
broader, including comments on other companies' products or
projections about the impact of possible year 2000 problems. A
utility trade group, for example, would have some protection if it
estimated how long power plants could operate on stockpiled coal if
railroads were unable to ship new supplies, as would a hospital
that reported to others that a particular medical device failed a
year 2000 readiness test.
</P>
<P>
   The experience so far with the new law raises questions, though,
about how much pent-up desire there is to share year 2000
information freely. At the very least, it suggests that while it is
popular to blame lawyers for discouraging such activities, many
other factors have also been involved. Some companies, for example,
fear use of the information by regulators or competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The new law's main impact has been to send businesses scurrying
to lawyers. Computer users are unsure how much shelter the law
provides and whether taking advantage of it in some cases is worth
the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our phones were ringing off the hook as soon as the law
passed,'' said Wynne Carvill, a partner in the large year 2000 team
at Thelen, Reid &AMP; Priest in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The rush for legal counsel stemmed in part from a provision
giving companies a 45-day window to bring some statements made as
far back as Jan. 1, 1996, under the umbrella of the law. That
window, which was opened when Clinton signed the bill into law on
Oct. 19, closed last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The retroactivity provision applied only to readiness
disclosures. Lawyers say there are several twists to the provision
that may undermine its value, including one requirement that
everyone who received the statement be informed that it is being
reclassified as a protected disclosure. Another provision gives any
customer who already relied on the statement 45 days to object to
its being reclassified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my clients think it's not worth the effort to go back
and dig up what they said in the past,'' said Mark Pomeroy, a
lawyer in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Many year 2000 project managers say information is beginning to
flow more freely. But both the managers and lawyers say pressure
from regulators and customers, not the new law, appears to be the
driving force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen people saying more because of the act,'' said
Michael Siavage, an Atlanta lawyer whose firm, the Red Hot Law
Group, has many software companies as clients.
</P>
<P>
   That could change, many experts say, as more industry groups
organize clearinghouses of information patterned after the group
set up by major automakers. John Koskinen, chairman of Clinton's
Year 2000 Council, has been encouraging the formation of such
groups. ``The critical thing is to exchange more technical
information, not readiness statements,'' he said. ``This is a way
to jump-start those who are late into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said he would like to see such information open to the
public but that the crucial thing was to make sure industry groups
made it freely available to everyone in their industries, including
companies that do not participate in trade groups.
</P>
<P>
   George Surdu, global coordinator of the Ford Motor Co.'s Year
2000 efforts, said the law would prove to be helpful in the long
run. ``The speed of enactment sent a strong message,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the law are already lobbying Congress to close what
they see as loopholes that limit its protections and to pass other
measures that might limit future lawsuits.

YET ANOTHER PROGRAMMER MUST DECIDE: STAY OR GO?  
 WITH CELEBRITIES IN TOW, PUBLISHERS GO A-COURTING  
 FREEDOM FORUM CHANGES FOCUS OF FELLOWSHIPS  
 IN NEW AUDIENCE SURVEY, CBS GETS A BIT YOUNGER 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two top network programmers have already left their networks in
the last month, and now a third is close to a decision to move on.
</P>
<P>
   Garth Ancier, the president for programming at WB, the growing
would-be fifth network owned by Time Warner, said he would decide
by the end of this week whether to stay with that network or to
leave when his contract ends in May.
</P>
<P>
   If he does not reach an agreement with WB, Ancier is widely
expected to join NBC as its chief program executive. Last month,
Warren Littlefield left that job and was replaced by Scott Sassa in
an interim move. Sassa is eventually to move up and replace Don
Ohlmeyer as president of NBC's West Coast operations.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Fox appointed Doug Herzog, the president of the
Comedy Central cable channel, to replace Peter Roth, its president
of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in negotiations,'' Ancier said. ``I have to make a
decision whether to stay or not. In the next week, we're going to
figure out whether I'm staying.''
</P>
<P>
   Ancier is among the most experienced programmers in the network
business, having previously worked both at NBC and at Fox, where he
was that network's first executive in charge of programming.
</P>
<P>
   Ancier is contractually obligated to negotiate only with WB
until February, when he can talk to other prospective employers.
But it is extremely unlikely that he will be able to join NBC or
any other company before his contract ends in May. Warner Brothers,
the studio that owns WB, has strictly enforced its contracts with
employees in the past, including its pact with Leslie Moonves, who
was in charge of television production for the studio before going
to CBS to be that network's top programmer.
</P>
<P>
   Ancier said: ``I agree with that. When you sign a contract, it's
the honorable way to see it to the end. If I leave, it won't be
because I don't love the company. I think an amazing tone has been
set here.''
</P>
<P>
   WB has advanced far faster than the other would-be fifth
network, UPN, which began at the same time. WB now has a core of
programs that are extremely popular with younger viewers,
especially teen-agers, including ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Buffy, The
Vampire Slayer'' and ``Seventh Heaven.''

   WITH CELEBRITIES IN TOW, PUBLISHERS GO A-COURTING
</P>
<P>
   After months of fits and starts, the trade association for
publishers is ready to do for books what milk producers
accomplished with celebrity milk mustaches: make reading hip.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Association of American Publishers is announcing
a monthlong campaign in May to court a younger generation of
readers with a catchy slogan (``Get Caught Reading''), fashion
magazine advertisements and celebrity volunteers (Rosie O'Donnell
and Whoopi Goldberg) to promote reading and, most important, book
buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just been very impressed with how receptive everyone has
been to the idea,'' said Patricia Schroeder, the former Colorado
congresswoman and the association's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   There were many hurdles before the association reached this
point of showing off photos of Rosie O'Donnell musing over a copy
of ``The Bean Trees'' by Barbara Kingsolver. At one point the
association considered a campaign, but backed away from a price tag
estimated in the millions of dollars. This newest campaign, which
is being subsidized with volunteer labor and seed money of about
$60,000, also had to appeal to all publishers, who naturally would
like celebrities to pose holding copies of their newest titles.
</P>
<P>
   But on this detail, the association achieved unity by declaring
that celebrities would promote only older, backlist titles of their
choosing. The notion was that magazine publishers would be more
willing to devote free advertising space if the campaign dealt with
titles of the past, Ms. Schroeder said. The publishers also were
striving for a campaign that tries without eat-your-peas
preachiness to reach their target group of 18-to-34-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is really needed,'' said Robert Miller, the
publisher of Hyperion, who is on the campaign's steering committee.
``We are in danger of losing the younger generation and we need to
show them that books aren't just something like a flu shot.''

   FREEDOM FORUM CHANGES FOCUS OF FELLOWSHIPS
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As fellowships go, the Freedom Forum's fellowships have a
Cadillac quality. Originally intended for writers working on books
or other in-depth projects about the press, they provide an office,
a half-time research assistant, a huge online data base of research
material, weekly seminars, and the close proximity of 9 or 10 other
fellows.
</P>
<P>
   It beats spending your time alone at home with writer's block,
even without the financial stipend that can reach $40,000 a
semester or $75,000 a year. Victor Navasky, the editorial director
of the magazine The Nation and a former fellow, said the
fellowships were ``the most valuable thing'' the Freedom Forum did.
</P>
<P>
   So when the foundation decided recently to disperse new fellows
around the country and preselect most of their research topics, the
news was greeted with dismay as it ricocheted around the book-party
circuit populated by former fellows like the authors Ken Auletta,
Sally Bedell Smith, Richard Reeves and Navasky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great program,'' said Auletta, who added, ``The
eminence of the big-shot names should not be allowed to obscure the
fact that a lot of junior and midlevel people came here and
produced a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Among projects that have attracted the past support of the
Freedom Forum have been: Auletta's book ``Three Blind Mice''; Ved
Mehta's book, ``Remembering Shawn's New Yorker''; Reeves' new book,
``What The People Know''; Lawrence K. Grossman's book ``The
Electronic Republic,'' and a study of Time Inc. founder Henry Luce
by the Columbia University history professor Alan Brinkley.
</P>
<P>
   Writing will continue, but most of it will be on subjects of the
Freedom Forum's choosing, according to the forum's chief executive,
Charles Overby. Barring disapproval by the foundation's trustees,
the fellowships in their current form end this spring. Next year,
the $500,000 budget that underwrote the New York program will be
spread around four centers _ at the Newseum in Washington, at its
New York City counterpart, at Vanderbilt University in Nashville
and in the San Francisco Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   Future fellows will focus on projects that have ``the highest
interest to the Freedom Forum's operating programs,'' Overby said.
As a hypothetical example, he said, a new fellow might base a
long-term study on the front pages of newspapers around the
country, which are assembled at the Newseum every day.

<P>
   IN NEW AUDIENCE SURVEY, CBS GETS A BIT YOUNGER
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is about to stop calling CBS the network for old folks,
but in what seems to be that network's never-ending quest to get a
little younger, the current television season is providing at least
some baby steps in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Namely, CBS' audience is getting younger. Or, perhaps more
accurately, it is getting a little less old.
</P>
<P>
   According to an annual median-age survey conducted by Steve
Sternberg, a senior partner of TN Media, a firm that advises
advertising clients on buying commercial time on television, the
median age for CBS' prime-time audience has dropped this season by
almost half a year. That is the good news because advertisers covet
a younger audience. The not-so-good news is that CBS still has the
oldest audience in television by almost a full decade.
</P>
<P>
   For the period from Sept. 21 through Nov. 22, the median age of
CBS viewers was 52.2 years, down from 52.6 for the corresponding
period last season. The next-oldest audience on television is
NBC's, with a median age of 42.7. But that is up 2.4 years from
last year.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, every network but CBS saw the age of its viewers
increase this season. For WB, which has gained a reputation as the
network for teen-agers, this qualifies as good news because
advertisers pay more to reach young adults than teen-agers. The
median age for WB grew from 24.2 to 26.7. The biggest age jump was
at UPN. It is up to 36.7 this season, from 31.7.
</P>
<P>
   The modest drop in age is not exactly cause for celebration yet
at CBS. The network is still dominated by shows whose viewers are
mostly over 50, the least valuable to most advertisers. CBS had no
show with a median age younger than 47.8 years. That show, the
youngest show on CBS, was ``Nash Bridges'' starring Don Johnson. _

20 YEARS LATER, SOME CHINESE PETITIONERS STILL SEEK REDRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The area around the Petitions and Appeals Office on
the south side of Beijing looks like any Skid Row. Loitering on
sidewalks, along the sides of a nearby canal and in the lobby of a
train station are hundreds of elderly men and women in frayed,
dirty clothes. In the icy weather they sleep in shoddy tents of
canvas or plastic, and they cook food scrounged from garbage over
open fires and use the streets or the canal for a toilet.
</P>
<P>
   But these are not ordinary derelicts, and the streets are not
littered with broken wine bottles. Carrying on an ancient Chinese
tradition, these sorry-looking people have come from the provinces
with little money but an all-consuming mission: to petition the
supreme rulers for redress of heartfelt grievances _ from alleged
thefts by corrupt local officials to pensions denied.
</P>
<P>
   So many of the street people are elderly because their
complaints, still unresolved, date back to the Cultural Revolution
of 1966 to 1976, when millions who were persecuted by Maoist mobs
lost property, jobs, even their lives. Some petitioners have hung
around the national Petitions and Appeals Office for 20 years,
repeatedly turned down by officials who cannot, at this point, see
how to help them.
</P>
<P>
   A typical petitioner is Dong Xiulan, a 78-year-old woman from
the northeast who appears neatly dressed for a person who has lived
under a bridge for 15 years. She started her quest in the late
1970s, first making trips to Beijing when officials in her home
county refused to help _ ``They acted like Lords, demanding that I
give them money'' _ then moving here for good in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   She says that because of bureaucratic mistakes her husband, a
Communist Party member and a fighter in the People's Liberation
Army in the war against Japanese invaders, was not awarded his
proper pension when he was discharged in the 1950s. Then in 1968,
Red Guards called her husband a ``capitalist roader'' and beat him
to death, she says, leaving her and their three children penniless
and tainted by association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not asking for another life in return for the life of my
husband,'' she said, clutching her husband's army discharge card
and a stack of tattered letters from a succession of offices that
denied they had jurisdiction in the case. ``I'm just asking for the
compensation my husband was entitled to.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she says, the appeals court is refusing to help because she
lacks proper personal documents and cannot afford to get them. But
she continues to make fruitless visits to the office every day and
survives by begging or eating discarded food.
</P>
<P>
   When China lacked a formal legal system, appealing directly to
higher authorities was the main means of seeking redress for
grievances. When the Communists took over in 1949, they continued
the tradition, with formal appeals offices in the provinces and,
for those who were still not satisfied, in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The practice reached a peak in the late 1970s, after Mao's death
and the end of the Cultural Revolution, when hundreds of thousands
of people each year appealed through these offices to have their
political condemnations reversed or to be compensated for lost
property.
</P>
<P>
   Many were successful. But some, for one reason or another,
failed to win their cases. And some, like the tenacious petitioners
living around the appeals office, have never given up trying.
</P>
<P>
   Clustered among the old people with 20-year-old cases, there are
several younger men who recently traveled from villages and keep
busy writing up their petitions. Some said they are here because
corrupt local officials had failed to give them disaster relief
payments they were due.
</P>
<P>
   But resort to this appeals office has dwindled as China has
begun to develop its legal system. More and more, people with any
money or bureaucratic savvy turn to other means _ lawsuits,
exposure in the news media or group demonstrations _ to fight
official mistakes or misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Petitions and Appeals Office, now something of a
backwater, remains besieged with the human flotsam from a period
that many Chinese would just as soon forget. The aging petitioners
persist with the burning quests that consume their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``My complaint is very deeply rooted,'' said Hao Chengyou, 63,
interviewed inside his tent of plastic sheeting under a bridge.
``But if they would even give me half of what I am asking, I would
be satisfied.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hao said he had worked at a petrochemical plant in the
northeast, in Heilongjiang province. But in the 1960s he was laid
off, and then supported his family by selling milk from their cow.
Because of that, in 1967 Red Guards labeled him a ``capitalist
roader,'' took the cow and sent him into the hinterlands.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, Hao has appealed in his home province and in Beijing
for a pension for his years as a state industrial worker, and for
payment for that cow. County officials now deny he ever owned a
cow, he said indignantly. ``The cow was pregnant when they took
it,'' Hao said. ``So they actually owe me for two cows.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun Yuying, 80, was a Communist army veteran, then ran a labor
camp. But he spent 10 years in jail during the Cultural Revolution
because, he says, he praised Deng Xiaoping, who was then in
disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his 20-year quest in Beijing for rehabilitation and
a pension _ which was denied, he says, because local officials lost
his all-important personal file _ he earned enough money selling
scraps picked out of garbage to rent a small room. But two years
ago, as rents jumped, he moved into a canvas lean-to along the
canal.
</P>
<P>
   Sun said he has finally given up. ``I am totally disappointed,''
he said, waving the blue rubber kitchen gloves he wore against the
frigid air. ``If I spend my time at that office, how can I make any
living?''
</P>
<P>
   Why Beijing officials have tolerated these unkempt street people
for so long is something of a mystery. Perhaps, some think, they
feel pity, or even a bit of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone does, though. In a street-side stall selling hats
and gloves near the appeals office, an exasperated vendor waved her
arm toward the petitioners strewn along the sidewalk with their
carts and bags of possessions and said, ``The police should just
get rid of them.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the reason they have been allowed to remain, the
petitioners themselves do not feel grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband fought for the revolution for many years,'' Ms.
Dong said. ``But now nobody has any sympathy for my misfortune.''

   STRIKES _ ATLANTA _ Despite a state law that demands mandatory
prison time for the type of crime probationer Timothy Carl Dawson
committed in 1995, a judge ordered probation. Dawson is now
suspected of killing five people _ four of them in hotel rooms. And
there are at least another 49 like him, probationers who would be
in jail but somehow have avoided the 10-year prison term demanded
by the Georgia Sentencing Reform Act, better known as the state's
``two-strikes-and-you're out'' law. ``I simply cannot understand

BOOKS OF THE TIMES: A TOP-10 SELECTION OF PICTURE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``In those days, as a little child,'' wrote the English poet
John Masefield, ``I was living in Paradise, and had no need of the
arts, that at best are only a shadow of Paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   A paradise childhood may well be, but occasionally grown-ups
must intrude, especially at bedtime, and one of the ways we do this
is with picture books, which, while mere shadows of paradise, are
good for easing the way to bed. The following are the 10 best I
found this year, arranged approximately from the most simple to the
most complex.
</P>
<P>
   FIRE TRUCK, by Peter Sis. (Greenwillow Books; $14.95.) A boy
named Matt loves firetrucks so much that one day when he wakes up,
he is one. ``He drove around his neighborhood with sirens blaring.
He raced down the road. He rescued a cat. He put out a fire. He
saved a teddy bear.'' Then when he smells pancakes he changes back
into a little boy and eats his breakfast. Peter Sis illustrates
Matt's obsession in colors that are mostly fire-engine red.
</P>
<P>
   SNOW, by Uri Shulevitz. (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux; $16.) In a
gray town, a single snowflake falls. The grown-ups say it means
nothing, but more snowflakes come. Gradually, as the town turns
white, you feel the child-eyed wonder of a snowfall and the
coooooold.
</P>
<P>
   BALLPARK, by Elisha Cooper. (Greenwillow Books; $15.) Baseball
may be a nine-inning game to you, but to the ballpark it's also a
red tractor mowing the outfield grass, a forklift moving boxes of
peanuts, a dryer spitting out hot uniforms and a furry animal
running out on the field. Cooper catches it all here in whimsical
watercolors.
</P>
<P>
   PETE'S A PIZZA, by William Steig. (Michaelo Di Capua
Books/HarperCollins Publishers; $13.95.) In which Pete is teased
out of the rainy-day grumps by being made into a pizza by his dad.
In the process the ``dough gets tickled'' and ``laughs like
crazy.'' When it's time to be sliced, the pizza runs away but gets
captured and hugged. ``Now the sun has come out. And so the pizza
decides to go look for his friends.'' Pete holding himself stiff as
a crust while being carried to the oven-couch is alone enough to
make you laugh.
</P>
<P>
   PAINTED DREAMS, by Karen Lynn Williams, pictures by Catherine
Stock. (Lothrop, Lee &AMP; Shepard Books/William Morrow &AMP; Co.; $16.)
Eight-year-old Ti Marie dreams of making pictures of ``huge green
trees that would wrap the whole village in cool shade,'' if only
she had paints like those of Msie Antoine, the local voodoo priest
and healer. When she eventually improvises a solution, she proves
that her art has commercial value as well as beauty. As does the
art of this appealing book.
</P>
<P>
   A BAD CASE OF STRIPES, by David Shannon. (Blue Sky
Press/Scholastic Inc.; $15.95.) Although Camilla Cream loves lima
beans, she won't ever eat them because all her friends hate them
and she longs to fit in. One morning she wakes up covered with
brightly colored stripes, which don't go away until she eats the
lima beans brought to her by a sweet old woman. ``I knew the real
you was in there somewhere,'' the woman tells Camilla at the end of
this delicious visual metaphor for the disease of caring too much
about what others think of you.
</P>
<P>
   OVER THE MOON, by Rachel Vail, illustrated by Scott Nash.
(Orchard Books; $15.95.) In her first three tries, the Mother Goose
cow jumps under, next to and through the moon. ``It's my nursery
rhyme,'' says the monkey-writer-director, Hiram Diddle Diddle.
``Can we please? Or do we need to bring in a stunt cow?'' ``No,
no,'' says the cow. ``I need this job! I got calves to feed. I can
do it. OVER the moon, right?'' And so it goes in this backstage
tale of heartbreak and triumph starring also a cat with a
Stradivarius, a dachshund that goes ``Ha!'' and a flighty dish and
spoon.
</P>
<P>
   THE ISLAND-BELOW-THE-STAR, by James Rumford. (Houghton Mifflin
Co.; $15.) Vibrant, engaging watercolors reveal how five brothers
set out from a tiny South Pacific island for a new island they
believe must lie under a brightly shining star. Surviving a vicious
five-day storm, they sight a bird that leads them to what a
concluding note explains are the Hawaiian Islands, lying below the
star Arcturus, which are believed to have been discovered more than
1,500 years ago by explorers from the Marquesas Island, 2,500 miles
to the south.
</P>
<P>
   BLACK COWBOY, WILD HORSES: A True Story, by Julius Lester and
Jerry Pinkney. (Dial Books/Penguin Putnam Inc.; $16.99.) In a land
``stretching as wide as love in every direction,'' the cowboy Bob
Lemmons picks up and follows the trail of a pack of mustangs, the
wild horses that live on the Western plains. With their poetic text
and theatrical watercolors, Lester and Pinkney bring to life a true
story based on the life of a black cowboy mentioned in ``The
Adventures of the Negro Cowboys,'' by Philip Durham, and ``The
Mustangs,'' by Everett Jones and J. Frank Dobie. The thunder of
hoofbeats pounds on the page.
</P>
<P>
   INTO THE ICE: The Story of Arctic Exploration, by Lynn Curlee.
(Houghton Mifflin Co.; $16.) A concise history of Arctic
exploration, from St. Brendan's encounter with an iceberg in the
North Atlantic about A.D. 550 to the flight a millennium later of
Joseph Fletcher, the U.S. Air Force pilot who landed at the North
Pole in 1952 and whose claim to have stood at the pole was the
first to go undisputed. The author's arctic landscapes are as clean
and cool and inviting as polar ice with a topping of azure.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One more day of record maximums are expected on Monday from
eastern New England through the Middle Atlantic States as balmy
breezes from the southwest precede a cold front. A few sunny
intervals along the East Coast will raise temperatures over 70
degrees in many locations, perhaps eclipsing monthly records set
during the past few days. A robust high pressure system over the
Southwest Atlantic will only slowly yield to clouds and scattered
showers. More record highs are expected along the Southeast coast
as temperatures rise more than 20 degrees above normal.
</P>
<P>
   The leading edge of more seasonable air will push to the crest
of the Appalachians by afternoon. However, a small disturbance
developing over northern Kentucky will cause the front to
temporarily stall just east of the Great Lakes. It will also
produce a swath of showers and embedded thunderstorms from West
Virginia to eastern Tennessee. As colder air seeps southeastward
across the central Lakes, a few snow showers will form over
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   A large ridge of high pressure stretching from Nevada to Lake
Superior will sponsor dry and seasonably cold weather over much of
the central and western United States. Light snow and flurries will
attend a disturbance as it weakens over New Mexico and the Texas
panhandle. Gusty winds will enhance the chilly air in the deserts
of the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Rain and gales will return to the Northwest Coast with snow
spreading into the Cascades as a cold front moves onshore. It will
stay rather cold across the interior.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: See-Saw Jet
</P>
<P>
   Like a giant see-saw, the jet stream tipped even further on
Saturday with all-time December warmth reaching into the Middle
West while a deepening chill in the Far West brought snow to low
elevations of California. Two inches of snow accumulated in Redding
in the northern Sacramento Valley. Even Daggett, in the Mojave
desert, had a sloppy mixture of rain and snow. Meanwhile, record
maximums were being eclipsed at the stroke of midnight in the East
with exceptional nocturnal warmth across the Great Lakes. The jet
stream will straighten out some this week leading to more
seasonable conditions.

RANGERS AND MAPLE LEAFS TAKE HOT STREAKS INTO MATCHUP
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA _ In recent seasons, the best features of the Rangers and
the Toronto Maple Leafs have been their classic uniforms and the
cachet that comes from being among the Original Six franchises of
the National Hockey League. Both teams missed the playoffs last
season, and their weakness in two major news media markets may have
contributed to a downturn in overall interest in hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed this season _ suddenly, if only temporarily. On
Monday night in Madison Square Garden, the meeting of the Leafs and
Rangers will pit two of the NHL's hottest teams. There will be a
buzz about it, and maybe even some snap, crackle and pop. The
Leafs, having moved from the Western to the Eastern Conference,
have 32 points, tied with the New Jersey Devils for most in the
East. The Rangers, with 25, are only a .500 team, but they have won
four in a row and have gone five games in succession without a
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels are many. Both teams are coached by veteran hockey
men who recently took charge after serving as general managers with
other teams. John Muckler of the Rangers ran the front office in
Buffalo; Pat Quinn of the Leafs served in Vancouver. Both teams
have star centers from Europe: Mats Sundin of Sweden for the Leafs;
Petr Nedved of the Czech Republic for the Rangers. Both have
veteran defensemen recently traded for each other: Mathieu
Schneider from Toronto to New York for Aleksandr Karpovtsev.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs also feature several players who used to be popular
Rangers. They are Tie Domi and Kris King, a couple of musclemen,
and goalie Glenn Healy, who is being recalled from the minor
leagues to replace Felix Potvin. Tired of serving as the backup to
Curtis Joseph, Potvin announced over the weekend that he would stay
home until he was traded.
</P>
<P>
   Domi played a major role in helping the Leafs win their seventh
game in their last 10 outings Saturday night, a 4-3 victory over
Montreal. With Toronto trailing by a goal late in the game, Domi
told Quinn on the bench that he and King should be used, along with
their linemate Darby Hendrickson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put us out there!'' Domi said, before scoring the tying goal
that sent the game into overtime. The winner was scored by Tomas
Kaberle, a rookie from the Czech Republic. Noting that the other
goals were scored by Daniil Markov and Dmitri Yushkevich, Domi
said: ``Look who else did the scoring _ two Russians and a Czech.''
</P>
<P>
   Domi was speaking of their enthusiasm for the ultra-Canadian
rivalry with Montreal, but his observation also applied to the
recent history of the Leafs. At one time, the Leafs tried not to
employ Russians. Under the new, progressive leadership of Ken
Dryden, the team's president, and Mike Smith, its associate general
manager, the Leafs are catching up with the world view of the sport
in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' latest victory, by 2-1 in Ottawa on Saturday night,
came with the help of goals by Niklas Sundstrom and Todd Harvey and
29 saves by goalie Mike Richter. The Rangers managed only 17 shots
on Damian Rhodes, but they played with a tenacity and patient poise
that seem to be growing as Muckler's philosophy takes root.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are getting into a situation where different people are
doing it on different nights, and that's what it takes,'' Muckler
said. `` I thought Sundstrom worked hard. I was very pleased.
Richter had his best game all year long. I thought he was
tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Richter, in the first year of longterm contract, said the
Rangers are a well-coached team and added: ``I'm enjoying playing.
It's such a good time when you are winning. Every time out there,
you expect good things to happen. Guys are buying into the system a
lot better than we used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Leetch, the captain, said the players feel comfortable
with their roles on the team, particularly since Nedved's arrival
almost two weeks ago that has helped to stabilize the forward
lines. ``Each line provides a little bit of everything,'' Leetch
said.

UNDER ATTACK, JUDGES SEEK SUPPORT FOR THEIR INDEPENDENCE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Two Supreme Court Justices joined 120 other
judges, bar leaders, and legal scholars here this weekend to
consider ways to bolster public support for judicial independence
at a time when judges are coming under frequent attack for their
rulings, their budgets, and perhaps most fundamentally, their
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe in judicial independence, you believe in
freedom,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy told an American Bar
Association symposium. He added: ``The bar must support the
judiciary in its cause when it is under attack. Judges do not have
political clout. They need the bar.''
</P>
<P>
   This conference, co-sponsored by the University of Pennsylvania
School of Law, was the first of three the bar association will have
on the subject over the next five months. The ongoing project will
include a national survey of public attitudes toward the judicial
system, to establish a baseline to measure the impact of those
proposals that are put into effect as the result of the project.
</P>
<P>
   In launching the program here, Philip S. Anderson, a Little
Rock, Ark., lawyer who is the bar association's current president,
cast a wide net. Thirty state court chief justices attended or sent
other judges or representatives of their court systems.
</P>
<P>
   While not everyone at the invitation-only conference agreed on
the dimensions of the problem, there was rueful assent to the
observation of one of the keynote speakers, Professor Steven Lubet
of the Northwestern University School of Law, that ``everyone loves
the concept of an independent judiciary, but only about half of us
really like independent judges, especially when we disagree with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also widespread agreement with a definition offered by
Justice Adolpho A. Birch Jr., a member and former chief justice of
the Supreme Court of Tennessee. ``Judicial independence is the
judge's right to do the right thing or, believing it to be the
right thing, to do the wrong thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The stars of the gathering were undoubtedly Kennedy and Justice
Stephen G. Breyer. Their decision to travel here, during a busy
period for the court, both underscored and validated the concerns
of the other judges, particularly those who ``are only an election
cycle, at most, away from unemployment,'' as Judge Wendell L.
Griffen of the Arkansas Court of Appeals described the
vulnerability felt by state judges who must face the voters either
for election or for retention in office.
</P>
<P>
   Most state judgeships are filled by election, and there was
considerable discussion about the threats to the image of an
independent judiciary posed by negative campaigns and by the
judicial candidates' need to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   One judge who described her own experience for the group was
Kate Ford Elliott of the Pennsylvania Superior Court, who lost a
race for the state supreme court last year after her opponent ran a
commercial in the last four days of the campaign accusing her of
having ``let criminals loose on technicalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Elliott remained on the Superior Court, an intermediate
appellate court. ``I don't decide Microsoft versus Netscape,'' she
said during a panel discussion of judicial elections. ``I decide
whether Joe Smith gets to have his child for the weekend'' and
similar cases ``very important for people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're allowed to do that because people trust us,'' she
continued, asking how a judge ``can you ever maintain that covenant
of trust'' after enduring a reputation-damaging political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Harold F. See of the Alabama Supreme Court held the
group spellbound with a videotape of the attack ads his opponent
ran against him in a 1996 race. Over the image of a skunk nosing
through the underbrush, the narration called See ``a slick Chicago
lawyer'' who never passed the Alabama bar exam. In fact, he had
taught for 20 years at the University of Alabama Law School and was
admitted to the Alabama bar without having to take the exam. He
spent $2.4 million and won the election.
</P>
<P>
   Because of such experiences, state judges rarely express much
sympathy for federal judges, protected as they are by life tenure.
Yet several of the scholars at the conference observed that life
tenure, a rare arrangement among the world's judicial systems, was
itself a source of political vulnerability for judges who are
easily portrayed as arrogant in their insularity and
unaccountability.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if there was one incident that galvanized the current
concern over judicial independence, it was the bipartisan attack,
early in the 1996 election year, on a federal district judge in New
York, Harold Baer Jr. In a decision questioning the credibility of
New York City police offices, Baer had ruled that the police lacked
an adequate basis to pull over and search a car in Washington
Heights and that the 80 pounds of cocaine and heroin they found
could not be used as evidence. After Republicans including Sen. Bob
Dole denounced Baer, a recent Clinton appointee, President
Clinton's spokesman suggested the President might seek the judge's
resignation. Within a few weeks, Baer reconsidered the case and
reversed his own ruling.
</P>
<P>
   That episode, as well as subsequent calls by several Republicans
in Congress for the impeachment of federal judges on the basis of
their rulings, led a number of groups, including the American
Judicature Society and the Century Foundation, formerly the
Twentieth Century Fund, to organize projects on judicial
independence. The Century Foundation's bipartisan group, Citizens
for Independent Courts, plans to issue a report in June on several
related issues, including how to define the line between legitimate
criticism and intimidation of judges.
</P>
<P>
   In brief remarks to the group here, Breyer stressed his view
that judicial independence exists not for the benefit of judges,
but of the people. He said that around the world, a realization was
growing ``that people's liberty and their prosperity depends in
part on their judicial institutions'' and that ``strong judicial
institutions depend on judicial independence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Judicial independence is in part a state of mind,'' he said,
`'a matter of expectation, habit and belief among not just judges,
lawyers, and legislators, but millions and millions of people.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, ``I don't think judges can help'' in their own
cause because judges' views are easily dismissed as ``institutional
self interest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes up to others to do the explaining,'' he told the
bar leaders and law professors, adding: ``That's why you're here.''

   RAFAH, Gaza Strip _ Cruising at 19,000 feet on Saturday in the
cockpit of the first Palestinian Airlines flight to depart from
Gaza's new international airport, Capt. Jamal Al-How from the
Jabaliya refugee camp could not restrain himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this historic moment, taking off for the first time in
history from a Palestinian airport, all the languages of the world
cannot express my pride and joy,'' he declared. ``I thank the
heroic Palestinian people, which sacrificed everything it had so
that we could reach this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, applause rang through the cabin as the 48-seat Fokker
50 propeller plane, painted with the Palestinian national colors of
red, green, black and white, took to the air. Mohammad Abdel Salam
from Bethlehem, the steward, greeted the passengers of Flight 152,
inaugurating regular service from the Gaza airport, which was
ceremonially opened last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome aboard the first flight from Yasser Arafat
International Airport, bound for Amman,'' Abdel Salam said over the
loudspeaker. ``Thank you for choosing Palestinian Airlines, and we
wish you all a pleasant flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed. In the not-too-distant past, the combination
of the words ``Palestinian'' and ``airplane'' evoked images of
gun-waving hijackers from the PLO. Now the Palestinians are running
their own airline from Gaza, with planes flown by former PLO
pilots, and Palestinian security men checking bags and passengers
for would-be terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1996, the tiny Palestinian airline was an
outgrowth of the accords with Israel on Palestinian self-rule. It
has two Fokker 50s received from the Netherlands, and a Boeing 727
donated by Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, which is still
being prepared for service.
</P>
<P>
   Starting operations in 1997 without a home airport, the
airline's first flights left from Port Said in Egypt, ferrying
Muslim pilgrims to Saudi Arabia. Regular service began a few months
later from the Egyptian town of El Arish to Amman and to the Saudi
Arabian city of Jeddah. Departing passengers had to make a
night-long trek by bus from Gaza to El Arish, moving slowly through
Palestinian, Israeli and Egyptian checkpoints to board flights that
took far less time than the ground journey.
</P>
<P>
   Flying from Gaza for the first time on Saturday, passengers
remarked on the simple convenience of going directly from home to
their local airport, avoiding Israeli interrogations and security
checks at border crossings and at Ben-Gurion airport near Tel Aviv,
Israel. It enhanced their sense that, while there was no
Palestinian state yet, something like one was emerging from the
often-troubled negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove here with my family, like anyone else in the world,''
said Ahmad al-Ghandour, a department head in the Palestinian
Authority. ``I'm leaving like people do everywhere else, on your
own plane, with your own passport.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahfouz Othman, a psychiatrist from Rafah, said that he was
relieved of the anxiety that often plagued his departures in the
past, when he was worried that he might be turned back or detained.
``I feel that I'm keeping my dignity; these are Palestinians like
us,'' he said as he handed his passport to a Palestinian police
officer. ``At a personal, human level, this is a changing point in
our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Not entirely. A short while after Othman spoke, Palestinian
security officers and Israeli counterparts keeping watch at the
airport got into a dispute about departure procedures, delaying
take-off for three-and-a-half hours.
</P>
<P>
   Fayez Zaidan, the airline chairman, came to the passenger lounge
to encourage his customers. ``We are with you facing the
Israelis,'' he told them. ``This is your airport.'' In the end, the
passengers were bused to the adjacent Rafah border terminal where
they went through passport control under Israeli supervision,
before returning to the plane. A few hours later, returning
passengers were delayed two hours at the same terminal for Israeli
security and document checks.
</P>
<P>
   But the first-day hitches did not mar the patriotic spirit on
the first flight from Gaza, and its passengers were greeted with
roses in Amman. Regular flights to Jeddah and Cairo, Egypt, are
scheduled to start in the next few days. The airline expects to
carry thousands to the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia in
March, and there are long-range plans to expand service to Cyprus,
Turkey and Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always imagined that it would come,'' said Zaidan, who is
also head of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority. ``There were
many obstacles and difficulties. I'm very happy that I could
achieve this goal of establishing a civil aviation authority from
zero, an airport from zero, an airline from zero. We did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has sent some of its 400 employees to train in
Morocco and Jordan, but the core of its crews and staff served in
what was once the air wing of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, or worked in airlines in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians also gained experience in the 1980s in Maldives
Airways, which was effectively owned by the PLO, and in Air Bissau,
a government-owned carrier in Africa in which the PLO was a major
partner.
</P>
<P>
   When it was still a guerrilla movement, the PLO sent volunteers
to flight academies in Pakistan and Yugoslavia, and in the 1980s,
Palestinian fighter pilots served in the air forces of Syria, Libya
and Yemen. The PLO air fleet consisted then of small transport
planes and helicopters, used mostly for travel between the
organization's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any revolution struggling for freedom, we were fighting
for the liberation of Palestine,'' said Yassin al-Hawamdi, a pilot.
``Now we're building up a state.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, Palestinians do not control their skies.
Take-offs and landings must be reported to the Israelis. Flights
from Gaza are barred from crossing Israel's southern air-space
because there are military installations en route, compelling
flights to Amman to detour over the Sinai peninsula, meaning that
they take about 90 minutes. Sophisticated landing equipment is
still being held in an Israeli port, and planes only land and take
off at the Gaza airport in daylight.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for the Palestinian Airlines staff, operating their national
carrier from their soil is a source of great satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have traveled everywhere, to 70 countries,'' said Abdel
Salam, the steward, who worked 15 years in Kuwait Airways. ``Now I
feel different. I'm taking care of my own people. We waited a long
time to realize our dream.''

   The New York Times' computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: Who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is not a very large
difference between Florida State (no. 1) and Tennessee (2), but the
difference between Tennessee (2) and Ohio State (3) is much larger.

PC MAKERS AND BELLS IN JOINT PETITION TO FCC 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoping to offer high-speed Internet access to more consumers,
the biggest personal computer company and local telephone companies
plan to petition the FCC Monday to relax regulations that they say
are impeding network modernization.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer and Gateway, together with Microsoft and Intel,
plan to join with the Bell local phone companies and GTE to
announce their allied effort Monday morning in Washington,
according to executives involved in the group.
</P>
<P>
   The communications and technology powerhouses intend to urge the
Federal Communications Commission to waive many of the rules
requiring the local phone giants to give would-be competitors
access to all parts of their networks. They also plan to ask for
exemptions from the rules barring the Bell companies from the
long-distance business, so they can offer wide-ranging data
services.
</P>
<P>
   The group contends that releasing the companies from such
regulations will give them the financial incentive to invest the
billions of dollars required to deliver corporate-caliber Internet
access to residential consumers at reasonable prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in the computer industry think we stand in the shoes of the
consumers here because we both want broadband deployment and
competition,'' Peter Pitsch, a former FCC official who is now
communications policy director for Intel Corp., said in a telephone
interview. ``Broadband'' is the industry term for high-speed
communications services that can include text, images and even
audio and video information.
</P>
<P>
   The group intends Monday to present the FCC with a statement of
10 principles that the companies say will promote the development
of advanced data systems for consumers. It also means to begin
lobbying members of Congress who have influence over communications
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If adopted, these principles would both promote competition
and strengthen the incentives of the incumbent local telephone
companies to promote broadband,'' Pitsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Under rules the FCC created in response to the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, the local phone incumbents are
required to sell access to different parts of their networks to
competitors. But the computer-communications alliance wants the
commission to let the phone companies reserve their advanced
Internet communications equipment for their own use. The Bells have
long said that the requirement to sell access to their systems
reduces their incentives to invest in and build advanced data
networks in the first place _ a point of view that the computer
giants have come to embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to undercut the incentives of the incumbent
companies,'' Pitsch said. ``Everyone is pretty much starting from
ground zero when it comes to these data services, and if they take
the risk, they ought to get the reward.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to competition, the group does intend to propose that
the local phone incumbents readily make space available in their
network-switching centers for competitors to install their own
equipment and that the incumbents be required to resell access to
the actual copper wires that run to homes.
</P>
<P>
   By proposing that the Bells be allowed into the long-distance
market for data services, the alliance will be seeking to at least
partly lift a long-distance ban that has been in place since the
breakup of the old AT&AMP;T Bell system in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three years ago, the Telecommunications Act opened a path
for the Bells to enter the long-distance arena. But Congress
stipulated that each Bell company would first need to convince the
FCC it had sufficiently opened its network to competitors _ a test
that no Bell has passed.
</P>
<P>
   The law, however, also directed the FCC to look into ways of
encouraging the development of more high-speed data options for
consumers. And for all of the hype that surrounded the passage of
the Telecommunications Act, most American consumers have no more
options for high-speed links to cyberspace than they did before
1996.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the FCC is under mounting political pressure to
encourage the mass-market availability of high-speed data systems.
So while the commission's chairman, William Kennard, is unlikely to
embrace the proposals wholeheartedly, he is also very likely to be
less hostile to them than his predecessor, Reed Hundt, would have
been. Hundt was seen in the communications industry as an
implacable foe of the Bells.
</P>
<P>
   In allying with the local phone carriers, the computer behemoths
are making their first significant foray into the political jungle
that is the world of telecommunications regulation. The proposals
are almost certain to draw harsh condemnation from the Bells'
archrivals, the long-distance companies, led by AT&AMP;T and MCI
Worldcom Inc.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, the formation of the alliance is a vivid sign of how the
computer industry has come to rely on the communications industry
to provide the Internet links that are driving the PC business. It
is a relationship that is almost certain to grow closer and more
complicated in the coming years, as Internet connections and
computers become perhaps as common as telephone dial tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time that the telephone industry has gotten
together with the computer industry and said, `Look, the capability
of the public network is really not keeping pace with consumer
needs for bandwidth, given the way the Internet is growing,''' said
Robert Blau, BellSouth Corp.'s vice president for executive and
regulatory affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Gruzen, Compaq Computer Corp.'s director for Internet
services, said connecting to the Internet is now the primary reason
that consumers buy computers. The problem for PC makers, though, is
that the speeds at which most home users link to the Internet from
home have not kept up with increases in processing power achievable
by the computers themselves. That means that users who already have
a powerful computer often have no compelling reason to buy a new,
more powerful one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deployment of broadband networks means you get multimedia
applications over the Internet,'' said Joseph Tasker, vice
president for government affairs for Compaq, the No. 1 maker of
personal computers. ``And computers and networks go together.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept of letting local phone companies avoid reselling
access to their data systems has gained currency at the No. 1 maker
of data networking equipment, Cisco Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cisco is apparently not a member of the new coalition,
John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive, said in an interview last
week that the resale requirements were standing in the way of the
phone companies' offering high-speed data services to consumers.
``If you build this infrastructure and you immediately have to sell
it to someone else,'' he said, ``the build-out is not going to take
place.''

CHOICES ARE PAINFUL AS CONFERENCE ON SOCIAL SECURITY SEEKS COMMON
GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The debate over how to prepare Social Security for
the next century has been cast all year as a philosophical clash
between those who would keep the system intact and those who would
rebuild it to allow individual investment in the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of which path Congress and the Clinton
administration choose, they will be forced to select from the same
unappetizing menu of benefit cuts, tax increases and tradeoffs
between risk and investment return to assure that Social Security
will be able to weather the baby boom generation's retirement.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton brings together members of Congress,
economists and public policy analysts on Tuesday and Wednesday for
a White House conference on Social Security, the focus will be as
much on those politically excruciating choices as on the sweeping
debate over the system's structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter which ideological side you're on, you still have to
make painful choices,'' said Ron Gebhardtsbauer, a senior pension
fellow at the American Academy of Actuaries, who will participate
in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials hope the conference will be a
springboard for legislative action to shore up the program, which
without any changes will run short of money starting in 2032. But
they said that the most they can hope for out of the conference is
to find some common ground as a first step toward bipartisan
legislation next year.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, the White House economic adviser, said that the
conference would be ``an opportunity to build some bipartisan trust
in an area that has often been typified by very partisan and very
harsh rhetoric in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Trust and bipartisanship will be essential because the options
that the conference will be examining are as explosive and subject
to demagoguery as any on the domestic political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Should the nation raise the retirement age, a step that would in
effect be a benefit cut for most people?
</P>
<P>
   Many economists say the answer is yes, since people are living
longer and healthier lives. Organized labor, however, is vociferous
in its opposition, saying it would be cruel to anyone doing
physical labor. Moreover, many people do not realize that the age
at which full retirement benefits can be claimed is already being
increased to 67 from 65 over the next 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   Should the relatively well off have to pay more in taxes to help
keep the system afloat?
</P>
<P>
   Social Security is financed by a 12.4 percent tax _ split
equally between employers and employees _ on earned income up to a
certain level, currently $68,400. Some proposals call for the
income cap to be substantially increased or even eliminated, steps
that would amount to a tax increase on middle- and upper-income
workers. Such an increase would help close much of the financial
gap facing Social Security, but would make the system a worse deal
for those paying the higher tax.
</P>
<P>
   Other ideas include reducing annual cost-of-living adjustments
and reducing benefits for wealthy recipients. Some are complicated,
like reducing the lifetime average earnings used in setting benefit
levels by increasing the number of years used in calculating the
average.
</P>
<P>
   Some seem relatively straightforward, such as requiring all new
state and local government employees _ many of whom are not covered
by Social Security _ to be brought into the system, helping to
increase payroll tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Some ideas have more or less been ruled out. There is no serious
discussion of an across-the-board benefit cut. And President
Clinton has all but promised not to raise the payroll tax rate,
although he has left open the option of increasing revenues through
other means, like raising the cap on taxable earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians on both sides of the aisle say the most likely
outcome is a compromise that includes some limited use of private
accounts, a variety of benefit cuts and tax increases, and use of
the projected federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is seriously considering support for some version of
individual accounts for Social Security, although his advisers
insist that he has made no decisions yet and that the most likely
outcome is a compromise between the competing visions. Clinton has
remained silent about which of the benefit cuts and tax increases
he might support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is wrestling with some of the difficult issues,''
Sperling said. ``I do not feel that he has locked in on one
specific proposal at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders all support some version of the individual
accounts plans, most of which call for diverting a portion of
payroll tax revenues into accounts that would be owned and
controlled by the worker.
</P>
<P>
   They have support from a number of prominent Democrats,
including Sens. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, John B. Breaux of Louisiana
and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. But most liberal
Democrats, especially those in the House, strongly oppose
individual accounts and say the current system, under which payroll
taxes go to pay benefits to current retirees, can and should be
maintained.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge underlying both approaches is to close a long-term
gap between Social Security's revenues and its promises to pay
benefits. Starting in 2032, unless changes are made, the system
will take in enough money from the payroll tax to pay only 75
percent of promised benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of individual accounts say the solution is to harness
the power of financial markets. Allowing a portion of their payroll
taxes to be invested through personal accounts will generate much
better returns for workers than the current system, they say, and
will give workers greater control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that when today's 30-somethings start to retire we
will not be able to pay the tab,'' said M. Anthony Burns, the
chairman of Ryder System Inc., who headed a study of the issue for
the Business Roundtable, an organization of large corporations.
``We must bolster our current social safety net by increasing
individuals' abilities to own and grow their retirement funds.''
</P>
<P>
   But shifting payroll taxes into private accounts creates a
problem. That money has already been earmarked to pay benefits to
current retirees. Current workers, therefore, would effectively be
called on to save for their own retirement and to support current
retirees simultaneously. As a result, individual account plans
require deeper cuts in guaranteed benefits for current workers than
those required by plans that would not establish individual
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of private accounts say the cuts in guaranteed
benefits will be more than offset by high returns on individual
investments. Opponents, however, say the result will be to leave
many retirees, especially those most vulnerable in old age, at he
mercy of the markets.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen an unprecedented level of outrage among working
families when they learn of the benefit cuts and tax increases
being proposed by those who would turn Social Security over to Wall
Street,'' said John Sweeney, the president of the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   Some liberals say the threat to Social Security is exaggerated
and that if the system assumes even moderate economic growth in
coming decades most of the problem will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Most liberals, though, are less sanguine, and the plans they are
advancing generally rely, just like those of conservatives, on Wall
Street. The difference is that liberals want the government rather
than individuals to do the investing, by putting as much as 40
percent of Social Security's reserves into stocks and bonds. They
say that such an approach allows the system to benefit from the
power of the markets without exposing individuals to the risks of
the Wall Street's ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, most plans advocated by liberals also call for benefit
cuts and tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   A plan developed by Henry J. Aaron and Robert D. Reischauer of
the Brookings Institution calls for accelerating the planned
increase in the retirement age to 67 and continuing to raise it
gradually as life expectancy increases; reducing spouses' benefits;
computing average lifetime earnings in a way that reduces benefits,
and subjecting a greater portion of benefits to income taxes.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Manhattan growls like an underfed pit bull in ``Stop
Kiss,'' a sweet, sad and enchantingly sincere play by the young
American writer Diana Son. The sirens, the horns, the tattoos beat
by unknown hands and feet on doors and floors: the sounds of the
city are edged in threats, signs of violence that has happened or
is waiting to happen. Yet it's all so irresistibly exciting, isn't
it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I love ... New York,'' says one character, newly arrived
there. The pause in her declaration suggests that she was intending
to finish the sentence with someone's name, but the substitution of
the city works nicely. In this delicately balanced comic drama,
which opened Sunday night at the Joseph Papp Public Theater,
falling in love with New York or in New York is risky. Only the
brave need apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop Kiss'' has probably generated the warmest advance word of
mouth of any downtown production this season. Only two days into
previews, it had sold 85 percent of the tickets for its five-week
run, which has been extended to Jan. 3, and it is easy to
understand why. As directed by Jo Bonney, with a fine cast led by
the wonderful Jessica Hecht, the production captures the heady
feelings of falling hard for a less than cuddly metropolis in ways
that musicals and plays like ``Wonderful Town'' and ``Barefoot in
the Park'' must have for other generations. But this particular
valentine comes equipped with warning lights. The problems of urban
living aren't just cute and eccentric here, though it might seem
that way when the evening begins. Cutting back and forth in time,
before and after a random act of violence that is the work's
center, the production generates an underlying ominousness in even
its lightest moments, so that toward its end, the clatter of
dropped silverware in a coffee shop generates disproportionate
unease.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. This story of a charmingly unfocused radio traffic
reporter named Callie (Ms. Hecht) and her friendship with Sara
(Sandra Oh), a schoolteacher from St. Louis, is also a gentle,
affectionate work, with a blithe sense of comedy that brings to
mind early episodes of ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show.'' Imagine Rhoda
and Mary slowly discovering that they are physically attracted to
each other, and you'll know what I mean.
</P>
<P>
   The breezy comic spirit doesn't trivialize the play's underlying
gravity. Only a few of the jokes or one-liners, such as a sideswipe
at Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, seem to exist for their own sake. Ms.
Son, who is 32, presumably grew up with television, like most
American children. To say that the impact shows is not an insult.
</P>
<P>
   She is able to transform sitcom situations, which were mostly
appropriated from boulevard plays to begin with, back into the
stuff of theater. The surface ease of ``Stop Kiss'' is belied by
its emotional and thematic continuity; images and ideas are linked
without calling didactic attention to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   You may have heard that ``Stop Kiss'' is about gay-bashing,
which isn't quite right. The signal event in the play is indeed the
brutal beating of a young woman after she is seen kissing another
woman. What Ms. Son does, however, is slyly place the occurrence in
the context of a larger consideration of the perils of living life
fully. Making choices and commitments is a scary business, ``Stop
Kiss'' suggests, but what is the alternative?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The play's heroine hasn't committed to anything when we meet
her. Callie, who is hovering around 30, came to New York as a
university student and has stayed on, fairly contentedly but
passively, showing initiative only in the selection of restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   She presents her job, surveying traffic patterns from a
helicopter for a radio station, as something to make fun of. She
and her longtime boyfriend, George (Kevin Carroll), sleep with
other people, but ``will probably get married,'' she says. The
rent-controlled apartment where she has lived for many years
(envisioned with pitch-perfect squalor by the set designer Narelle
Sissons) is still mostly unfurnished, with stacks of newspapers as
its most prominent decorative accent.
</P>
<P>
   This description, which brings to mind the perpetual adolescents
of television shows like ``Friends'' and ``Seinfeld,'' may make you
wish you could switch channels. But that only means you haven't
seen what Ms. Hecht can do with a part like this. As she
demonstrated in Christopher Kyle's ``Plunge'' last season, this
actress, who brings to mind the young Sandy Dennis without the
post-nasal drip, finds symphonic shadings in ambivalence and the
short attention span.
</P>
<P>
   Here, she creates a portrait of someone who has made a defense
system out of being easily distracted, the idea being that if you
don't focus, you won't want things too badly. Watch how Ms. Hecht's
eyes are suddenly arrested, in mid-conversation, by an article in a
newspaper, randomly spread on the floor, or the gentle bobbing of a
cat's wire toy. Listen to how her voice slides, like a virtuoso
skater, away from self-revelations. As someone else says of her,
she has a tendency, in all things, to ``swerve.''
</P>
<P>
   This observation is made, in a delightfully drunken moment, by
Sara, the Midwesterner who, against her parents' and boyfriend's
wishes, has come to New York to work with third-grade public school
students in the Bronx. Unlike Callie, Sara is strongly focused and
alarmingly unafraid, to the point that she feels compelled to
answer beggars and harassers on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the women meet, it's clear that they share a sense of
humor and a whimsy that borders on the precious and might be less
appealing in the hands of two other actresses. Ms. Oh's Sara mixes
wryness with enthusiasm, and she has a nifty way of dropping her
voice into a low register to punctuate the ends of her sentences.
Ms. Oh doesn't have Ms. Hecht's variety or fluidness, but the
actresses balance each other well.
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble is rounded out by four other performers, all
excellent. The magnetically casual Carroll and the deliberately
self-conscious Rick Holmes, as the respective men in Callie's and
Sara's lives, are perfect contrasts that further define these
women, and the play wisely doesn't dismiss the complexity or appeal
of these earlier romantic relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Saundra McClain is dead on as both a bourgeois witness to a
crime and a Caribbean hospital nurse. Saul Stein, in the evening's
only thankless part, does what he has to as the detective who
questions Callie after Sara is beaten senseless.
</P>
<P>
   These scenes of interrogation are spliced early into the
continuing narrative of Callie's and Sara's mutual sentimental
education, and they are initially a brutal contrast to the rest of
the play. Yet as staged by Ms. Bonney, with the enriching
assistance of James Vermeulen's lighting and especially David Van
Tieghem's sound effects and music, the production never loses its
sense of the connections between the lightness and the darkness,
which are weaved seamlessly in Ms. Son's script.
</P>
<P>
   It is also impossible to imagine a better tour guide through
this uncertain landscape than Ms. Hecht. Callie is asked throughout
the play, as it seesaws in time, to make the sort of whiplash
emotional transitions that could cause nosebleeds. Ms. Hecht never
strips gears and never seems less than fully committed to each
moment. Her ability to embrace unlikely extremes matches that of
the play, and it's what makes ``Stop Kiss'' considerably more than
a sitcom with a conscience.

NEWCOMER FLORIDA PLAYS IT SAFE TO DETHRONE NORTH CAROLINA
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DOUG HOOGERVORST   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Danielle Fotopoulos scored in the sixth
minute to lead upstart Florida to a 1-0 upset on Sunday over
two-time defending champion North Carolina in the National
Collegiate Athletic Association women's soccer championship.
Florida, which did not have a women's soccer program until four
years ago, became the youngest program this decade to win a title,
and Becky Burleigh became the first woman head coach to win an NCAA
soccer championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it,'' Burleigh said. ``I've been saying that
from the sound of the horn until now. I just can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fotopoulos, the nation's leading scorer this season and the
NCAA's career leader in goals, was fouled during a run about 20
yards from the goal. Fotopoulos took the ensuing free kick, and the
ball flew over four North Carolina defenders and hit the underside
of the cross bar before bouncing in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't ask for a better placed shot,'' said North
Carolina goal keeper Siri Mullinix. ``I got a finger of my glove on
it. I felt it, but I couldn't stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, in front of an NCAA record crowd of 10,583, Florida
packed its defense so tightly that North Carolina _ winner of 14 of
17 NCAA championships _ rarely had room to maneuver. Florida (26-1)
kept all 11 players on its end for 40 of the 45 minutes in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   By playing so many players back, the Gators _ whose only loss
this season was to North Carolina _ challenged every pass and every
player, earning 31 fouls. When Florida could not win the ball and
kick it far down field, the Gator defenders just looked to knock it
over the sideline in order to run time off the clock. The
start-and-stop pace suffocated a North Carolina offense that is
known for its free-flowing style.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Carolina's advantage, they got a number of free kicks, but
it really showed that we were there, doing whatever it took,''
Fotopoulos said. ``When you play hard like that, you get fouls.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, North Carolina (25-1) had a three-to-one
advantage in time of possession, and it became more one-sided in
the second half. The key, however, was that the Tar Heels took just
one shot from closer than 12 yards.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's best chances to tie came in the first half. On
a corner kick in the 37th minute, defender Lori Fair settled the
ball and fired from 18 yards, but it was right at Florida
goalkeeper Meredith Flaherty, who knocked it over the end line.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, North Carolina's Anne Remy took a 17-yard
shot from left to right and Flaherty dove to knock it away.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, North Carolina only saw one real scoring
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Just into the 58th minute, Florida cleared the ball to midfield,
but North Carolina's Laurie Schwoy immediately lofted it back to
the penalty area. Florida was caught with its defenders moving
forward as the ball floated back. North Carolina forward Cindy
Parlow was in the area and headed a shot toward the right post, but
Flaherty reacted and caught the shot.
</P>
<P>
   With eight saves in the championship games and shutouts in both
Final Four games, Flaherty was named the tournament's most valuable
defensive player. Only three goals were scored in the Final Four, a
record low.
</P>
<P>
   Fotopoulis was named the most valuable offensive player.

CONSERVATIVE'S SHIFT ANGERS BACKERS 
WHAT GOES AROUND, ETC. 
ANOTHER DOLE FOR PRESIDENT? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Nev., N.C., Kan.)  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since he said he might seek his party's nomination for
president in 2000, Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., has been angling hard
for the support of the religious right. Always solidly
conservative, he has become even more so in recent months,
repeatedly punching the buttons that most energize Christian
conservatives _ no more abortions, no more federal financing for
the arts, no more immorality in high office.
</P>
<P>
   The response from this powerful political group has been
encouraging, and the senator's friends say he is increasingly
inclined to jump into the 2000 contest.
</P>
<P>
   But a few days ago, Ashcroft suddenly made a major adjustment in
ideological course, one that turned heads and has left some members
of the religious right angry and others wondering just where the
senator stands on the causes dearest to them.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the Detroit Economic Club _ all serious
presidential aspirants drop in on this powerhouse collection of
business captains _ he veered back to the political center, taking
a swipe at the religious right on the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party, he warned, is fast approaching the point
where ``the things that are dividing us are defining us.'' Then he
added:
</P>
<P>
   ``We must never confuse politics and piety. For me, it is
against my religion to impose my religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, he talked only economics to the economics crowd. Not
once did he mention abortion, federal support for the arts or the
Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   His omission drew quick reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, the religious conservative who heads the Family
Research Council and who is also considering a run for the
Republican nomination, charged that Ashcroft was driving his own
divisive wedge into the party's ranks by ``ignoring the craving of
Republicans and conservatives for someone who will defend innocent
human life and the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Weyrich, an Ashcroft supporter who runs the Free Congress
Foundation, cautioned the senator to choose his words more
carefully in the future. ``You simply can't afford to have your
base in an uproar over speeches you give,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft aides insist that while the senator is in fact
beginning to change his political emphasis a bit, he has not
changed his core beliefs. They say that in the wake of the Nov. 3
Republican election debacle, he wants to focus less on emotional,
hot-button issues and more on the kinds of issues that proved to be
Republican winners that day, notably tax cuts, fiscal
responsibility and welfare and education reform.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to disappointed members of the religious right and to
many political pros, Ashcroft suddenly sounds like an echo of Gov.
George Bush of Texas. Bush has been talking a lot recently about
party unity and moderate, ``compassionate'' conservatism, and polls
indicate he leads the Republican presidential pack.
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada, Betting on a Vote Recount
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1974, when he came within 624 votes of winning a seat in
the U.S. Senate, Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, demanded a recount.
It cut his margin of defeat to 611 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years later, Reid finally made it to the Senate and last
month he won re-election to a third term _ by a margin of just 401
of the 415,000 votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   What goes around often comes around for those who stay in
politics long enough. So now Reid finds himself facing a demand for
a recount by his Republican challenger, Rep. John Ensign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad political move,'' argues the senator, citing personal
experience and noting for extra measure that no Nevada election
result has ever been reversed by a recount.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't change the outcome,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Ensign counters that since the initial ballot count had him
losing by just .09 percent of the vote, he would be ``letting a lot
of supporters down'' if he did not demand a second count. And he
has put his money where his mouth is, anteing up the $59,108 that
Nevada's secretary of state calculates a recount will cost.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, a partial recount has already been conducted in a
Nevada county in which 6,000 paper ballots were improperly aligned
in voting machines. But that count cut Reid's lead by only 58
votes, to the 401 figure.
</P>
<P>
   If the full, statewide recount leaves him still a loser, Ensign
says he may appeal to the Senate for a review.
</P>
<P>
   Reid professes not to be worried. He points out that if there
were any serious doubt among his Senate colleagues about his margin
of victory, he would not have been elected last week to the
second-ranking Democratic job in the Senate, minority whip.
</P>
<P>
   A footnote:
</P>
<P>
   If Ensign does manage to get the results reversed, his $59,108
will be refunded.
</P>
<P>
   A Draft Campaign for Elizabeth Dole
</P>
<P>
   Earl Cox, the Republican organizer who once led an effort to
draft Colin Powell for a presidential run, is at it again.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by his failure to dragoon the popular retired Army
general into running, he now wants to draft another popular
Republican, Elizabeth Dole, president of the American Red Cross and
wife of Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican candidate.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, Cox set up a ``Draft Elizabeth Dole''
headquarters in an old railroad depot in Salisbury, N.C., Ms.
Dole's hometown, and next he plans to open a second office in
Kansas, her husband's home state. With the help of a former
Salisbury mayor, Margaret Kluttz, he is also sending out letters
that seek support for a draft from members of Congress and
Republican chairmen around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth Dole has an impeccable reputation for being a person
of high moral character,'' the letter states. ``Her government and
corporate experience have earned her a reputation for being a
strong and honest leader. Untainted by politics, Elizabeth Dole is
well qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole, who has never run for elective office but has twice
been a presidential Cabinet officer and has often been mentioned as
a possible vice presidential choice as well as a presidential
choice, has offered multiple answers on whether she might run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to,'' she said flatly in one interview early
this year. But then, in a speech in September, she pulled back a
bit and said, ``I guess I've learned in this world never to say
never.'' Finally, in an interview last month with The Salisbury
Post _ at a time when some polls had her running second in a
theoretical race for the GOP nomination _ she said: ``I have
thought seriously about it, and I've learned never to say never and
then sort of leave it there.''
</P>
<P>
   So there.

MEXICO CONSIDERS EXTENDING PRESIDENTIAL VOTE TO IMMIGRANTS IN
U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Calif., Colo., Ga., Ill., N.Y., Texas)  (rl) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico _ It is the year 2000. Millions of Mexican
immigrants line up outside polling places, not only in Los Angeles,
Brooklyn and other major locations in the United States where
Mexicans have settled but in hundreds of towns across the country,
preparing to vote in Mexico's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Mexican election officials have fanned out across
the United States to supervise the balloting, which caps a campaign
in which candidates barnstormed through Mexican population centers
in dozens of American states. They lambasted U.S. policies,
unpopular in Mexico, on immigration, narcotics and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   Fiction? No, this is the scenario that emerges from a recent
Mexican government study, which, at the request of the Mexican
Congress, offers detailed logistical options and budgetary
estimates for extending the vote to the estimated 10 million
Mexicans living in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is viable,'' the report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of potential votes are at stake, perhaps 15 percent of
the Mexican electorate, and the Mexican Congress must decide in
coming months whether to approve any of the options the report
outlines.
</P>
<P>
   In the month since the report's publication, opposition leaders
have praised its proposals as a long-overdue attempt to extend
suffrage to migrant workers who have been disenfranchised both in
Mexico and the United States. But President Ernesto Zedillo's
allies in the governing Party of the Institutional Revolution,
known as the PRI, have lampooned them as too costly and
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   For whom would Mexicans north of the border vote? The
conventional wisdom holds that they would favor the opposition
because many migrants are thought to blame the PRI for the economic
problems that forced them to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The debate gained volume on Friday, as prominent American
academics joined Mexican leaders on both sides of the fray during a
conference at Tijuana's Colegio de la Frontera Norte, a
government-financed research organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implications of all this are frightening,'' said Rodolfo
O. de la Garza, a professor of government at the University of
Texas, contending that an extended display of Mexican politicking
on U.S. soil would provoke a nativist fury in the United States
directed not only at migrants but also at Mexican-Americans. ``When
the rocks start flying, xenophobic Americans are not going to ask
for an ID card,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio Zebadua Gonzalez, the counselor in the Federal Electoral
Institute who coordinated the study, shrugged off the criticisms.
``We have to decide whether Mexicans who live in the United States
have the rights of other Mexican citizens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's voting study was set in motion in July 1996 when
Mexico's Congress deleted a clause from the constitution requiring
Mexicans to vote in their home districts and mandated the electoral
institute to study ways of extending the presidential vote to
Mexicans abroad.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other countries allow their citizens living in the
United States to vote in their presidential elections, but none of
the operations are on the scale that would be needed for voting by
Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   The institute impaneled 13 demographers and other social
scientists, and on Nov. 12 they published a 14-volume study, one of
the most detailed ever produced about Mexicans in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 million potential Mexican voters live north of the
border, including 7.1 million Mexican-born immigrants and 2.7
million adult children of Mexican-born parents, who could also
exercise the right to vote under the Mexican Constitution, the
report said. In addition, about 100,000 Mexicans live in the other
countries, and voting rights could be extended to this group as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Three out of four Mexican immigrants live in 33 counties in
California, Arizona, Colorado, Texas, Illinois, Georgia and New
York, the report said. The other quarter are widely dispersed
throughout the rest of the country, including Alaska and Hawaii,
with only 11 American states having few or no Mexican residents,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The report lists procedures that would allow Mexicans in the
United States to receive credentials complying with the exacting
electoral standards that have allowed Mexico to largely eliminate
ballot fraud in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Six ways were suggested for Mexicans to cast ballots in the
United States. Most would involve establishing polling places in
consulates, churches, Mexican-owned businesses and immigrant homes.
The report also outlines the possibility of voting by mail or
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the registration and ballot procedure chosen,
extending Mexico's vote north would cost between $76 million and
$356 million, the report said. The latter figure is roughly
equivalent to the government's entire yearly anti-poverty budget.
</P>
<P>
   Considerable debate at Friday's conference centered on how much
interest Mexicans living in the United States might have in voting
in Mexican elections. Citing opinion samplings collected among
migrants passing through border cities and Mexican airports, the
study reported that 83 percent of Mexicans living north of the
border want to help choose the Mexican president, but that many
said they could spare little time to register or to cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Cornelius, a political science professor at the University
of California at San Diego, said an increasing number of migrants
live permanently in the United States but remain interested in
Mexican politics because they finance construction of churches and
other public works in their Mexican hometowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider these voting proposals to be of fundamental
importance for the democratic transition in Mexico,'' Cornelius
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Passel, a demographer at the Urban Institute in
Washington, D.C., also praised the report but questioned why Mexico
would consider allowing the 2.7 million children of Mexican parents
living in the United States to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many don't speak Spanish and have never been in Mexico,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Reynolds, an economics professor at Stanford University,
said the proposals would anger many Americans and undercut efforts
to involve Mexican immigrants more fully in U.S. politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will cause a political explosion, trust me,'' Reynolds
said. ``I know the United States, and we've not had a very happy 10
years in U.S.-Mexico relations. If you go forward with these plans,
there will be a huge conflict.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Much discussion centered on the 2.7 million potential voters who
live in the United States with no immigration documents. The report
suggests that Mexico might seek to negotiate guarantees from the
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service that undocumented
Mexicans would not be arrested while waiting to vote. But Roger
Diaz de Cossio, a Mexican diplomat who designed an array of foreign
ministry assistance programs for migrants, scoffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The INS has laws to obey, and they're going to obey them
regardless of whether Mexicans are going to the polls,'' Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
   Ernesto Ruffo Appel, whose 1989 to 1995 tenure in Baja
California made him Mexico's first non-PRI governor in the modern
era, accused the authorities of whipping up opposition to the
voting proposals out of fear that migrants will vote against the
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that fear is well-founded,'' Ruffo said. ``So for the
good of Mexico, it's important to get going on this now.''

ATHLETES TODAY HAVE BIG MONEY APPETITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``And I think we'll need some Rice,'' one of the shoppers
decides as the camera pans over to Jerry Rice, sitting inside the
meat counter at a supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly you have seen the ad on television, pitching a video
service that promises to deliver all the pro football games one
person can digest on an autumn Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Rice _ San Francisco's superb wide receiver _ the
video ad features quarterbacks Brett Favre, John Elway and Troy
Aikman. They agreed not only to climb inside a meat counter and sit
there like butterflied legs of lamb, they also allowed themselves
to be hauled out of the supermarket in shopping carts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, these players are all superb talents. They have already
achieved status as multimillionaires. But for a few extra bucks
they willingly contribute to the meat-on-the-hoof stereotype of
professional football players.
</P>
<P>
   Let me tell you how it was in my day.
</P>
<P>
   If Favre played for one of Vince Lombardi's Green Bay football
teams, he would learn upon reporting to the next practice session
that he had been traded to Albertson's for a case of pork and beans
and 30 pounds of ham hocks.
</P>
<P>
   Would boyhood heroes of an earlier era _ Joe DiMaggio, Ted
Williams, Bill Russell, Jim Brown, Dick Butkus or Y.A. Tittle _
have allowed themselves to be tossed around like a packing-plant
shipment of rump roasts, picnic hams and turkey hind quarters?
</P>
<P>
   They would not. For starters, Russell wouldn't fit inside a meat
case. They all had too much personal pride.
</P>
<P>
   Would Julius Erving or John Havlicek have signed on as pro
rasslers, like Karl Malone and Dennis Rodman did after the 1998 NBA
season?
</P>
<P>
   Would Lord Laurence Olivier accept the starring role in a remake
of ``Pee-wee's Big Adventure''? I think not.
</P>
<P>
   Shove a camera and a few bucks in front of today's pro athletes
and they'll not only ``say cheese'' they will recite 600 varieties
_ from Asiago to Zamorano _ while modeling tutus in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The problem seems to be that today's athletes are eating too
high on the hog and have appetites that cannot be appeased. In the
old days, athletes were happy just to come home to a hearty,
inexpensive dish like this one.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star Ziti
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dried basil
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon dried marjoram
</P>
<P>
   1 pound lean ground beef or ground turkey
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   10 ounces ziti or penne pasta
</P>
<P>
   2 and one-half cups of your favorite spaghetti sauce
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half cups shredded mozzarella cheese
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Dump the ground beef or turkey into a mixing bowl and add the
garlic, onion, basil and marjoram. Moosh everything around with
your hands. (If you have just been petting some friendly dog, don't
feed this dish to your guests. Give it to the critter.)
</P>
<P>
   Heat the olive oil in a skillet. Add the turkey mixture and
saute, busting it up with a wooden spoon as it browns. Stir in the
wine and vinegar and saute 3 minutes more. Dump in the spaghetti
sauce, salt, black pepper and red pepper flakes and slow cook
another 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile you should have been cooking the pasta tubes in
boiling, salted water.
</P>
<P>
   When the pasta is just done, drain and dump it into a casserole.
Add the turkey sauce and gloop everything around with that spoon.
Mix in the mozzarella, then sprinkle the top with Parmesan.
</P>
<P>
   Shove the casserole into a pre-heated, 400-degree oven until top
is beginning to brown, about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Serves six, followed by a light, healthy dessert like this one.
</P>
<P>
   All-Conference Compote
</P>
<P>
   2 cups orange juice
</P>
<P>
   Minced zest from one lemon
</P>
<P>
   Juice of one lemon
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds assorted fresh fruit
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup orange-flavored liqueur
</P>
<P>
   Use whatever fruit is in season. Thanks to air-freight shipping,
something good is always in season. Last time we prepared this
dessert, we used bite-size pieces of fruit from one papaya, two
peeled peaches, 1 cup blueberries, 2 unpeeled apricots, one-half
pound pitted cherries and two-thirds pound of fresh strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   Combine all ingredients except the strawberries, cover and
refrigerate. Just before serving, mix in the strawberries. Serves
eight wide receivers or four offensive linemen, with biscotti.

   RESTORED GLORY
</P>
<P>
   In the 16th and 17th centuries, emperors, kings, dukes and
cities across Europe commissioned his bronzes for palaces, gardens
and churches. But after his death, his name receded from
prominence. Perhaps it was because this artist worked outside his
native Netherlands or because his style was so individual that he
attracted no flock of imitators. Then, in 1989, he aroused fresh
interest when the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., paid more
than $10 million for one of his sculptures. On Saturday the artist,
Adriaen de Vries, will be the focus of a major retrospective at the
Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Continuing until March 14, this show,
``Adriaen de Vries, 1556-1626: Imperial Sculptor,'' assembles 50 de
Vries bronzes, 70 percent of his known work, from public and
private sources, ranging from the Louvre in Paris and the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan to the collection of Queen
Elizabeth II of Britain. In addition, some 25 works on paper will
be displayed. Information: 011-31-20-673-21-21.

foxes versus farmers will run at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for
seven performances through Dec. 22. Information: (213) 972-8001.

   For the second production of its 20th season at the Loeb Drama
Center in Cambridge, Mass., the American Repertory Theater will
present Shakespeare's ``Merchant of Venice,'' directed by Andrei
Serban, with original music by Elizabeth Swados. In repertory with
the season's first production, Racine's ``Phaedra,'' the show will
run from Friday through Jan. 22. Information: (617) 547-8300. ...
Having begun its Mainstage season with Charles L. Mee's ``Berlin
Circle,'' the Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago moves on this
week to a classic of American theater: Tennessee Williams'

 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alvin Ailey's imprint on his dance company is still
so strong that one often forgets how many works he commissioned
from experimental choreographers who worked in styles other than
his own. That is the context in which to view Judith Jamison's
``Echo: Far From Home,'' a new work that gives nonlinear narrative
an original twist.
</P>
<P>
   After Ailey's death in 1989, Ms. Jamison succeeded him as
artistic director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and
pursued a two-pronged policy. The classics of Ailey, Donald McKayle
and Talley Beatty, who emerged from the modern-dance mainstream of
the 1940s and '50s were preserved in the company repertory. These
works, more than others, are identified with the humanist strain
that defined Ailey as man and artist.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Jamison also continued a policy of reaching out to
choreographers who focused on new forms as much as emotional
expression. Ailey introduced into the company post-1960s rebels.
These included Rudy Perez, Louis Falco, Jennifer Muller, Ulysses
Dove, Kathryn Posin, Diane McIntyre, Elisa Monte and Bill T. Jones,
some of whom favored repetition, reductive vocabularies and
Minimalist music.
</P>
<P>
   These elements are part of Ms. Jamison's esthetic as a
choreographer, and as director she has favored post-modern
choreographers like Dove, Donald Byrd, Jawole Willa Jo Zollar and
herself as well as Lar Lubovitch in his Minimalist mood.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these choreographers are black and some are white, and
when a few touch upon the black heritage that is the company's
prime inspiration, they do so more obliquely than their
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   No easy definition, then, fits Ms. Jamison's ``Echo: Far From
Home,'' which was given its premiere by the company on Friday night
at City Center (131 West 55th Street, Manhattan). The images
onstage are of universal relationships: parents react to each other
and to their daughter, who also reacts to a lover and a ballet
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be coy to suggest that the black experience is
foreign to this piece. It even begins with a taped voice declaring
``No black children in this school,'' as the audience sees a photo
of a girl in a tutu. That ``Echo'' has an autobiographical tinge is
not to be excluded. Not every white ballet teacher in the 1950s (or
later) accepted black pupils.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jamison begins and ends with the photo of the girl in the
tutu. If one reads her narrative line correctly, the child triumphs
over discrimination by finding her true self. She becomes a dancer
without rejecting her identity, which is defined in two ways: Ms.
Jamison's dance idiom and Tom Feelings' paintings. These suspended
panels, with their forceful swirling strokes of paint, include
portraits and evocations of the slave ships of the past.
</P>
<P>
   The African heritage is part of Ms. Jamison's choreography. It
is not that she reproduces African dances, but what looks like
purely formal movement here incorporates elements of African dance
(rapidly moving bent knees, tilted torso and arms shooting upward).
</P>
<P>
   With a post-modern sensibility that draws from eclectic sources,
she creates her own fascinating idiom. When she stylizes African
dance, it becomes something new as in a solo for Edward Franklin, a
wonderfully imposing dancer who watches over the heroine as an
ancestral figure. He is called Mentor in ``Spirit Walker,'' the
second part of this nine-part suite.
</P>
<P>
   With its episodic structure, the work has admirable movement
quality but leaves its characters undeveloped. One can also wonder
on what level of irony Ms. Jamison is operating. Linda Caceres is
the daughter who wears a black halter and Romantic tutu over her
shorts; her solo is called ``Degas Me.'' Richard Witter as a
virtuosic seducer and Linda-Denise Evans as a leggy pinup of a
teacher, share the same cartoonish quality. The teacher even passes
down to her pupil a pair of red shoes, fairy-tale symbols of the
urge to dance.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the emotional imagery is more realistic for
Uri Sands as the carpenter-father who seems set against both his
daughter's career and her boyfriend. A duet, strongly danced by
Sands and Renee Robinson as the mother, expresses some conventional
angst. Robert Ruggieri's percussive Minimalist-style score adds a
trendy hard edge. ``Echo: Far From Home'' is anything but tidy in
its shifts of sensibility: an interesting but disjointed work.
</P>
<P>
   It was, however, extremely well danced as was everything else on
this program. Dwana Adiaha Smallwood's breathtaking delicacy and
perfect form lent new elegance to ``Cry,'' Ailey's great solo in
praise of ``black women everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   A beautifully rehearsed ensemble, bobbing dynamically through
changing angular shapes, gave the striking abstract design of Hans
van Manen's ``Polish Pieces'' clarity and wit. There was also time
for strong emotions in the work's duets with Ms. Evans and Franklin
and especially Mucuy Bolles and Bernard Gaddis. Ailey's
``Revelations,'' superbly performed, completed the program.

TURKS FEAR EUROPEAN INTEREST IN KURDS THREATENS UNITY OF TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ European leaders are focusing new attention
on the 14-year Kurdish insurgency in Turkey, and many Turks believe
their interest can be explained with a single word. It is a word
that burns in the Turkish psyche, even though few non-Turks have
ever heard it: Sevres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to say this, but some European countries are
longing for a revival of Sevres,'' Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
asserted recently. ``All these efforts are in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   Yilmaz is serving as a lame duck until a new government can be
formed, but his designated successor, Bulent Ecevit, holds the same
view. In a warning to European countries that they must not shield
Kurdish rebels, he said, ``Their ambition for a new Sevres will not
be fulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sevres Treaty of 1920, named after the French town where it
was signed, ordained that much of what is now Turkey be divided
among foreign powers. Its most valuable and productive regions were
apportioned to Greece, Italy, France and Armenia, with the
strategic Bosporus and Dardanelles straits put under international
control. Turkey was left only with Ankara and a swath of land
around it, much of it mountainous and inhospitable.
</P>
<P>
   That treaty, imposed on the dying Ottoman Empire, set off a
burst of patriotic outrage among Turks. Their empire had been
shrinking steadily for more than a century, and they considered
Sevres their final humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, they rose up in
rebellion and defeated foreign armies in a spectacular series of
battles. In 1923 a new treaty was signed in Lausanne recognizing
Turkey's new power and scrapping Sevres.
</P>
<P>
   With the Sevres treaty dead, most of the world forgot it. Turks,
though, did not. Many are convinced that the world is still
plotting to dismember Turkey. They see every claim for regional or
cultural autonomy, including those put forward by Kurdish
nationalists, as means to this end. Turkish historians and
sociologists call this belief ``the Sevres syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   This fear was revived again last month, when the principal
leader of Kurdish rebels, Abdullah Ocalan, was arrested in Italy.
Not only has Italy refused to extradite him, but some political
leaders there and in other countries are showing sympathy for his
cause. Many Turks believe that their hidden agenda is to create a
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, thereby ripping the country
apart as envisioned at Sevres.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan lived in Syria for years, obscure and all but friendless.
Turkish leaders thought they had won a great victory earlier this
year when they forced Syria to expel him. But suddenly they find
themselves on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   By turning up in Rome, Ocalan has become a European figure. His
cause is being debated more widely than it ever was while he was
living clandestinely in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do the same as the Basques and the Irish Republican
Army,'' he told an interviewer in Rome a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   This stance is unbearable to many Turks, who consider Ocalan a
terrorist guilty of heinous crimes. They are outraged that some
Europeans are treating him as a potential peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He calls himself a guerrilla, but what could he do when his
people were being systematically killed?'' said Danielle
Mitterrand, widow of the former French president and a longtime
supporter of the Kurdish cause. She said that if Ocalan is put on
trial, Turkish generals should be put on trial alongside him.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Achille Silvestrini of Rome said of Ocalan: ``If so
many Kurds are coming to support him, then it cannot be simply a
terrorism issue. It is a European issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the European Parliament have called for an
international conference on the Kurdish issue, a suggestion Turkey
rejects unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
   As a way of showing their fury at Italy for refusing to
extradite Ocalan, Turks have done everything from burning Italian
neckties to boycotting pizzerias. Signs raised at some of these
protests carry slogans like ``Turkey Will Never be Divided'' and
``No to Sevres!''
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators have begun warning that such protests may not
be the best way to persuade foreigners that Turkey is mature enough
to resolve its Kurdish problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if it would be useful for us to remember Ataturk's
style,'' Zulfu Livaneli, a columnist, wrote in an Istanbul
newspaper this week. ``Even in the worst days of the war, he did
not directly oppose Western powers even though they were trying to
divide Turkey. He did not curse anyone or trample on anyone's flag
or fall into the trap of anger or hysteria.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are afraid of Sevres,'' Livaneli wrote, ``but we don't
learn from the man who put Sevres in its grave.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ When Rhoda Wright learned that the television
assembly plant where she had worked for 27 years would close, she
did all the right things. She helped to counsel fellow workers
through their shock. She used her $13,000 in severance to pay off a
car loan. And once the plant shut in April, she enrolled as an
accounting student _ hoping to one day get back to her old wage of
$10.60 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   But for all her energy and determination, a bleakness creeps
into Mrs. Wright's story. Her unemployment insurance will run out
by next December, six months before she graduates. She expects to
land an accounting job quickly enough, even at age 49, but only at
$8 an hour. ``I don't have a clue anymore what our income is going
to be,'' she said, ``but we'll get by. We always have.''
</P>
<P>
   She has told her two grown daughters not to come to her for help
anymore. Her big concern is that her husband, Ronald, who is 53 and
just back at work as a metal worker after suffering a mild stroke,
will fall ill again. ``I would probably have to quit school and
take one of those $6-an-hour jobs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wright is hardly alone in the difficult choices she must
make after losing a job she had counted on to sustain her until
retirement. Plant closings, layoffs and forced early retirements
are rising sharply again. The cutbacks announced last week at
Bankers Trust, Boeing and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, and threatened at
Exxon and Mobil, are only the latest examples. But the outcries and
conflict that accompanied downsizing in the 1980s and early 1990s
are largely gone.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than protest, unions are more likely to help laid-off
members move on to other jobs, often working in tandem with the
very managers who did the laying off. For their part, corporate
executives no longer call attention to downsizing as healthy for
profits and stock prices. Much more often they express regrets,
blame global forces beyond their control, fatten severance packages
for workers and announce layoffs well in advance of the final day.
</P>
<P>
   The downsizing is coming just when a strong job market, mainly
in the service sector, offers new jobs more quickly than in the
past, and that softens the blow considerably. Unemployment has
fallen to 4.4 percent nationally and less than 3 percent in central
Indiana. The layoffs are concentrated in manufacturing, both
nationally (245,000 jobs have disappeared since March) and here in
central Indiana. More than three dozen companies have announced or
carried out layoffs here in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would see a more militant and adversarial relationship
come back if the unemployment rate were two or three percentage
points higher than it is today,'' said Larry Gigerich, president of
the Indianapolis Economic Development Corp. ``There are plenty of
unfilled jobs, and although they are at lower pay, people feel they
can take them and work back up to their old wage, or they feel that
another job will soon open up like the one they lost. Such
expectations are not necessarily realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Mrs. Wright is far from regaining her old wage, and
so are most of her former colleagues at Thomson Consumer
Electronics. Thomson gave 14 months' notice to 1,100 workers that
its television plant in nearby Bloomington would be closed in
April, and the operation moved to Mexico. Since then, only 100 have
matched or bettered their old pay _ at a General Electric Co. plant
in Bloomington that makes a popular double-door refrigerator and
has been adding staff at $10 to $12 an hour. Thomson had paid
$10.50 to $11 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Still, labor unions and workers seem more willing than in the
past to accept, as beyond anyone's control, the reasons offered by
corporate America for a plant closing or a layoff. Lately, the main
reason given is the Asian crisis, which has killed demand for
American merchandise in that once-vibrant region and stepped up the
flow of inexpensive foreign merchandise to this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be realistic,'' said George Becker, president of the
United Steelworkers of America. ``If it is inevitable that a place
is going to go down and there is nothing that can be done to save
it, if there is no way to compete or there is no market for the
product _ if that is going to happen, we are going to negotiate
with the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal subsidies, channeled through the states, also ease the
pain. The money goes not only for retraining but increasingly for
counseling, often on the shop floor right after a layoff is
announced. Some of the federal money pays the wages of labor union
staff members involved in retraining. Despite all the help,
regaining the old wage rarely happens.
</P>
<P>
   The largest group of former Thomson workers, more than 500, has
taken early retirement, accepting lump-sum pension payments of
$80,000 or less instead of the $90,000 or more they would have
received at full retirement. Mrs. Wright is among 200 men and women
who are either unemployed or going to school to qualify for new
careers, according to the company and the union, the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Two hundred ex-Thomson workers
have found jobs at lower pay.
</P>
<P>
   Many in this group joined Cook Inc., a nonunion shop that makes
medical catheters in Bloomington, and pays $6 to $8 an hour. But
some, like Martie Hammer, a 46-year-old divorced woman with no
children, were more adventuresome.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hammer, who drove a forklift at Thomson for 17 years, took a
four-month course in truck driving, and now drives a
tractor-trailer cross-country for the Celedon Corp., one of
numerous truckers here, all of which seem constantly short of
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Her life has changed. Instead of being home every evening, she
is on the road for 10 days, sleeping in a bunk in her tractor cab,
then at home for two days. That is a disruption, she says, to her
social life. And her pay is less: Not quite $400 a week, compared
with her Thomson wage of $424, excluding overtime, which in her
case averaged 15 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind driving a truck,'' she said. ``A lot of people
would not do it, but I am trying to get back to where I was at
Thomson. It takes away from your self-esteem until you find
something as good, or better. You know there has to be something
better.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Thomson's ex-employees have been engaged in this odyssey
to regain their old wages for only eight months. Six hundred former
Maytag Corp. employees have been struggling for two years, with
little more to show for it. Their Maytag jobs ended in December
1996, when the company closed a stove factory in Indianapolis and
moved the operation to a nonunion factory in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 400 of the 600 workers placed in jobs in less than a
year; we were happy about that,'' said Gigerich, who worked with
the Private Industry Council, a local group of union and corporate
representatives that lent a hand. But today few of the former
Maytag workers earn the $34,000 annually they averaged at Maytag.
</P>
<P>
   The best paid, roughly a third of the old work force, earn about
$25,000, mostly at the numerous machine tool shops in this area,
Gigerich said. Another group found work at about $22,000 in
warehouses and distribution centers, as forklift drivers or loading
trucks. And a third group earns about $20,000 in retail stores or
at the telephone customer service centers and data processing
operations that have proliferated in this area.
</P>
<P>
   The Maytag layoff _ announced in February 1996, nine months
before the plant closed _ was a turning point, the first
significant example in greater Indianapolis of the softer approach
to downsizing. A year earlier, the First Data Corp., which employed
1,000 people at a telephone service center here, had closed the
operation on short notice without first notifying the local
government. Downsized workers told hardship stories in television
interviews, and city officials were publicly critical.
</P>
<P>
   The officials wanted less confrontation. And Maytag obliged.
Apart from the nine-month lead time, Maytag sweetened the severance
package beyond what the contract with the Sheet Metal Workers Union
required. The company also piled on overtime in the final months,
mainly to stockpile stoves but also to give workers extra money to
pay off debts and build up nest eggs _ an opportunity most took.
Finally, the company participated in a worker-management committee
that supervised retraining and counseling. A $1 million federal
grant financed the endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to tell that work force that you could not have
done anything to prevent the move,'' said Thomas Schwartz, a Maytag
spokesman. ``That plant closing, and the way we worked with the
city, and the employee group, that is as close to a model as I can
come up with.''
</P>
<P>
   That still leaves Margaret Edens and her husband, Clifford,
struggling. Both had worked at Maytag, she assembling stove
counters at $12.50 an hour, he repairing stoves at $13.13 an hour.
They finished up in a marathon of overtime and then, when the end
came, they used some of the accumulated pay to finance a week's
vacation in the Southwest _ the Grand Canyon, Las Vegas, Nev.,
Monument Valley _ before facing their new, diminished life.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Edens, who is 44, is the sort of worker who corporate
managers and union officials point to as ideal in a downsizing
situation. She is among a minority, they say, with the
self-discipline and focus to benefit from job training, and also
among a minority with the emotional fortitude to overcome the
trauma of losing a pay package she cannot easily replace.
</P>
<P>
   After Maytag announced the closing, she became a union
representative on the transition committee. For a while, she drew a
federally subsidized salary as a case manager, counseling laid-off
workers, including some from Maytag _ work she loved. Now she has a
part-time job as a claims taker in the state employment office,
earning $8.05 an hour, without benefits. Her goal is to work full
time in the employment office, with benefits, although the pay, she
says, will probably be less than what she earned at Maytag.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to make money and our life style just rose,'' Margaret
Edens said. ``Now when I get up, it is, `How much do we have to
earn to get by?' And that is $8 or $9 an hour for each of us just
to maintain a middle-of-the-road life. We are just managing to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Edens, also 44, reacted to the downsizing the way many
workers do. He shunned job training or counseling, and did not
accept, until months later, that he would probably never match his
Maytag earnings and company-paid health insurance. ``You work so
long for a company, you lose touch with the job market,'' he said.
He had entered the factory in 1972, right out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Edens had hoped to shift into social work, but without
more schooling, he said, the pay was an ``unrealistic'' $7.50 an
hour at best. He took a job at a Goodwill Industries factory, as a
group leader at $9 an hour, helping disabled workers keep an
assembly line going. But the work was too stressful and he soon
left.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he learned from a friend of an opening at Flexalloy
Inc., as an inspector and tester of the giant bolts and other
fasteners the company supplies for bridge and building
construction. There was an on-the-job training requirement, and a
federal training grant helped for a while to pay his starting wage
of $9.25 an hour. That was in September of last year; he now earns
just over $10, and pays $12 a week for health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am treated very well at this company,'' he said, allowing
himself a little optimism. ``There are positions there that pay $13
an hour or more that I could possibly attain.''

FOR AN ACQUISITION TO WORK, TWO CULTURES MUST MERGE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., N.Y., Pa.)   (mk) 
 By JANET STITES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1995, Nick Kramer, then a 25-year-old wine seller turned
technology entrepreneur, joined three friends and started
Spacelab.net, an Internet service provider. Within three years, the
company grew to a staff of 22 and was one of the leading such
services in New York City for businesses, listing among its
customers Allen &AMP; Co. and Hollinger International.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the four founders sold the company to Verio Inc., a
company based in Englewood, Colo., that had built itself into a
nationwide Internet service provider by acquiring smaller
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The men found themselves with some money in their pockets, but
they were also suddenly reporting to a manager on Long Island,
N.Y., who had to report to a manager in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months later, Kramer is the only one of the original
founders still working for Verio. His new title is indirect channel
sales manager.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on life post-acquisition, Kramer observed: ``The
hardest adjustment is going from the top of the pyramid to middle
manager. And for the rank and file, it's difficult to go from being
somebody _ an integral part of the company _ to being one of
1,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the departure of his partners and one employee, the
staff remains intact. But some companies are not so lucky. In the
information age, acquiring a company is not just about product or
revenue, but about intellectual property and talent, as well. The
trick is to hang on to both.
</P>
<P>
   Scot Sedlacek, managing director of Broadview Associates, an
investment bank in Fort Lee, N.J., said: ``With technology-oriented
companies, the asset you are buying is the people. An adviser can
run the numbers front and back, but the most difficult aspects of a
successful merger are the post-integration issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from holding on to managers, companies have to deal with
innate issues of corporate culture _ or simply culture clash. A
prime example is the planned merger of the New York-based music Web
site N2K and CDNow of Jenkintown, Pa., to create a single super
music-playing-CD-selling Web site. The merger solved a lot of
financial problems. Both stocks had plummeted earlier this fall
with the overall market drop.
</P>
<P>
   But culturally, the two companies are as diverse as their
geography. N2K's management hails from the music industry, as do
many of its employees; CDNow is known more as a storefront rather
than an influence in the music industry, and its young founders are
considered e-commerce prodigies. CDNow has a basketball court; N2K
has a house band.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Marino, an associate of Sedlacek's at Broadview, said of
such mergers generally: ``You can't just slam the two companies
together and hope they are going to work. You need to spend the
same amount of time working with the people as you do working on
the valuation.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadview advises clients to outline expectations up front so
that there is no confusion about what roles the top employees will
be playing in the new entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good buyers in technology do a lot of due diligence up front
to make sure cultures do mesh,'' Sedlacek said.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman and chief executive of the Web development company
Think New Ideas, Ron Bloom has had a lot of experience dealing with
acquisitions. The company, now public, was forged in a roll-up of
six companies and then acquired six more. He does not take the
acquisitions game lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a cultural plan to match your fiscal plan,''
Bloom said, adding that a cultural plan has to take into account
profit and loss, return on investment and cost of opportunity, just
as a financial plan does.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom does not disclose his company's entire strategy, but he
says that Think New Ideas generally finds a way to work with a
company before acquiring it. ``We'll do a joint venture to test
quality and the strength of relationship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once Think New Ideas has made an acquisition, it sends in a
``culture'' team, which goes over operations, sales strategies and
the like. ``We want to send a clear message that they are part of a
family and they can benefit from the family,'' Bloom said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he said, ``You need to prepare for culture shock; you
have to look for a six- to nine-month period to optimize
performance as the cultures get to know each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloom also has a plan for acquisitions that end up not working.
``We deploy a team to get to the heart of the problem,'' he said.
``Usually, we can work it out. The trick is to keep the entities on
both sides focused on growing the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Verio, iXL, a Web development company based in Atlanta, has
built itself through acquisition. Since being formed in April 1996,
it has acquired 34 companies, including two New York-based Web
design shops.
</P>
<P>
   That said, iXL's president, Bill Nussey, said, ``We don't think
of ourselves as being in the acquisitions business.'' Rather,
Nussey said, acquisitions are a way to acquire talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get talented people more rapidly than we can
hire them,'' Nussey said.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, iXL looks for a company with a vision and a culture
that are similar to its own. ``We have walked away from people who
have tons of revenue but had management teams which we didn't think
would be a good part of this company,'' Nussey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any assets,'' he added. ``If our people aren't
really happy, we have nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep talent, Sedlacek and Marino advise empowering employees
and building in financial incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put a wad of money into people's pockets and don't do
due diligence in the way of people, six months later they might be
off to the next start-up to do it again,'' Sedlacek said.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Verio, Kramer, who at age 28 has already built and sold
a company, says he is now building a career.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it's a blow to the ego not to be in charge,'' he
said, ``but the opportunity is so much better now. It's an
education to see how a larger, national company works.''

IN 1868, HOUSE IMPEACHED FIRST, MADE CHARGES LATER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Perhaps it's unfair to keep comparing the Clinton
impeachment process to the Nixon days, the way Democrats do when
they say Henry Hyde and his judiciary committee don't measure up to
Peter Rodino and his.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Congress in 1974 was not a perpetually snarling,
partisan body. Nor was it then considered impossible, or
undesirable, to keep the committee's evidence a secret, the way it
is today when grand jury testimony is played on television and
Kenneth Starr's lurid evidence is published before Congress has
even read it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, moreover, tear-jerk television programs like Oprah
Winfrey's hardly existed, so Rodino would have had no inspiration
to display remorseful perjurers the way Hyde did last week.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the happier comparison for today's Republicans is to the
only time the House actually voted to impeach a president, Andrew
Johnson, in 1868. Then the House itself voted to impeach first, and
drafted particular charges later. At least this time the committee
plans to draw up its accusations against President Clinton before
it votes to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   On television Sunday, Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the
committee's senior Democrat, called the Republican mood
``psychopathic. People want partisanship, blood.'' And Joe
Lockhart, the White House press secretary, complained last week
that Republicans were rushing.
</P>
<P>
   What would they have thought about 1868 for a precedent? On Feb.
21, President Johnson fired Edwin Stanton, the secretary of war.
Rep. Thaddeus Stevens, the leader of the radical Republicans,
exulted that the simmering fight would now come to a head: ``If you
don't kill the beast, it will kill you.'' And in very short order.
</P>
<P>
   That day, the House referred the issue to the reconstruction
committee. On the 22nd, the committee recommended:
</P>
<P>
   ``Resolved, That Andrew Johnson, President of the United States,
be impeached of high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said he saw no need to debate the issue. But others
disagreed, and there was debate that night and again on Monday the
24th, before the House voted 126 to 47 for impeachment. The actual
articles of impeachment finally came up for a vote on March 3. They
accused Johnson of violating the Tenure of Office Act in firing
Stanton and of denouncing Congress as unfit to legislate with the
Southern states excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have complained this year that the judiciary committee
has not given them as much of a chance to dispute the case against
Clinton as Nixon's defenders got in 1974. That is true, but except
for the debate on the House floor, in 1868 Johnson's side in the
House had no opportunity at all to make its case.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York complained last week: ``We
haven't had hearings, not hearings with witnesses, not real
hearings. We've only had sham.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, while they had witnesses (in closed sessions) in 1974,
they never had any in 1868, though perhaps they did not need them.
</P>
<P>
   Even without cross-examining Monica Lewinsky, the House can
certainly decide that it has enough evidence that Clinton committed
perjury and sought to obstruct justice. And it can deem those
offenses so serious in their threat to the legal system that they
qualify as impeachable and that by doing so he violated his oath to
``take care that the laws be faithfully executed.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the menace to Clinton is clear enough, it is worth
remembering that the stakes for the nation are nowhere near as high
today (or in 1974) as they were in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, having pushed through the 13th Amendment abolishing
slavery, wanted a quick restoration of the rebel states to the
Union.
</P>
<P>
   The radical Republicans put no trust in the white leaders of the
new governments he helped install (and the Black Codes they enacted
made the distrust reasonable).
</P>
<P>
   They fought Johnson, demanding a severe Reconstruction that gave
blacks the vote and denied it to many whites. They insisted on the
14th Amendment with its guarantee of equal protection of the laws.
And when Johnson campaigned against them in 1866, trying to rally
Northern Democrats over the exclusion of the South, they beat him
badly and increased their majority.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings in the House were political, pure and simple.
Since Johnson had succeeded from the vice presidency on Lincoln's
death, under the law of that time the next in line for the
presidency was Sen. Ben Wade of Ohio, the president pro tempore of
the Senate who was a leading radical Republican. Ousting Johnson
would put the presidency, and Reconstruction policy, firmly in
radical hands.
</P>
<P>
   When the issue came to the Senate, it turned more heavily on
legal issues (probably in large part because Johnson backed down
and agreed to name a new secretary of war whom the radicals could
accept). Stevens compared the Senate's role to a scaffold, since it
was clear Johnson had violated the Tenure of Office Act.
</P>
<P>
   William Evarts, Johnson's chief defense lawyer (though a critic
of his Reconstruction policy), insisted that the Senate had to
function as a court and consider that the president had not just a
right but a duty to test the constitutionality of the act.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate had 42 Republicans and only 12 Democrats. It took 36
votes to convict. Despite intense pressure from their party, seven
Republicans bolted, and Johnson was acquitted on May 16, 1868.
</P>
<P>
   A telling argument that some of today's impeachers may welcome
came then from Sen. William Pitt Fessenden of Maine, who filed a
written opinion: ``To the suggestion that popular opinion demands
the conviction of the president on these charges, I reply that he
is not now on trial before the people, but before the Senate ...
The people have not heard the evidence as we have heard it. The
responsibility is not on them, but upon us.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote that he would not deserve the trust of his
constituents, and would be ``unworthy of a place among honorable
men, if for any fear of public reprobation, and for the sake of
securing popular favor, I should disregard the convictions of my
judgment and my conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, there is a precedent from 1868, in the days before
continual polling has established that the public does not want
Clinton impeached, to which today's radical Republicans can cling.

KENNEDY CENTER HONORS 6 FOR THEIR ARTISTRY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A former child star and a pioneer black star of
television shared the stage Sunday night at the annual gala of the
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
   The two, Shirley Temple Black and Bill Cosby, were joined by the
composer Andre Previn, the singer-songwriter Willie Nelson and the
Broadway songwriting team of John Kandor and Fred Ebb as recipients
of Kennedy Center Honors.
</P>
<P>
   Cosby, 61, whose starring role in ``I Spy'' in 1965 was the
first by a black actor in a television series, was also a
television fixture in the 1980s comedy series ``The Cosby Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Black, 70, whose roles as a child cheered up a weary nation
during the Depression, followed her acting career as an ambassador
to Ghana and Czechoslovakia. She said at a luncheon for the
recipients that she would primarily like to be remembered ``as a
wife and mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, at a dinner at the State Department for the six
recipients, Nelson looked uncharacteristically genteel in a tuxedo
and Texas cowboy hat that he had specially made for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the farmlands of Texas 65 years ago, Nelson, who
revolutionized country music with his singing and songwriting, and
the other honorees received their medals from President Clinton at
the White House before the gala at the Kennedy Center.
</P>
<P>
   At Saturday night's dinner, the actor Jack Lemmon, who won a
Kennedy Center honor two year ago, said of Cosby, ``He shows us the
delicious truths of our ordinary lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Previn, 69, has conducted five symphony orchestras, and appears
regularly as a guest conductor for the Vienna Philharmonic. Most
recently, he adapted Tennessee Williams' play ``A Streetcar Named
Desire'' to opera.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Berlin whose family moved to Los Angeles before the
Nazi takeover, Previn said he felt particularly grateful for
receiving the award because ``it is such a peculiarly American
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Kandor, 71, the composing end of the team, and Ebb, 63, the
lyricist, make up the longest-standing partnership in Broadway
musical history. Some of their best known musicals include
``Cabaret,'' ``Chicago'' and ``Kiss of the Spider Woman.''
``Caberet'' won a Tony award for the best musical in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   The pair are known both for their optimistic songs like ``New
York, New York'' and ``How Lucky Can You Get,'' and for their
taking on serious topics as they did in ``Caberet,'' which captured
fascism in pre-war Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how he kept such an optimistic outlook, Ebb said
matter-of-factly, ``Because things like this keep happening to me.
It is life-affirming to know that your work is so appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's program, the Kennedy Center's principal
fund-raising event of the year, was videotaped for broadcast on CBS
on Dec. 30.

   In an era in which astronauts spend weeks in space and sheep are
cloned, it is hard to imagine the excitement _ or the controversy _
the two men created in 1953. That was when Chadwick and his
colleague, Michael Ventris, announced that they had unlocked the
secrets to a puzzle that had confounded scholars for more than half
a century, and even determined that Linear B was a style of Greek
used 500 years before the age of Homer.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery began in 1900 when Sir Arthur Evans, a British
archaeologist excavating the ancient Minoan palace at Cnossus, on
Crete, discovered clay tablets imprinted with strange pictographs
that had been baked kiln-hard and had survived a fire that had
destroyed the palace 3,000 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The 90 or so symbols on these and other tablets later found
elsewhere on Crete and in a few places on the Greek mainland, dated
to about 1400 B.C., and bore no resemblance to any known writing
system. Evans gave them the prosaic name of Linear B, to
distinguish the writing from a system he called Linear A.
</P>
<P>
   Evans and other scholars may not have been able to decipher
Linear B or to account for its origin, but they had no doubts on
one point: it was not Greek. That language could not possibly have
been used when Crete was under Mycenaean control, they said, and
anyway, the entire Bronze Age world was thought to have been
illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, when Ventris and Chadwick published their findings,
they were widely derided by scholars who felt it was impossible
that there had been a Greek-speaking people on Crete hundreds of
years before the rise of the Greek city states, notwithstanding the
two men's analysis of an apparently consistent syntax and their
plausible reading of the tablets as Greek listings of commercial
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the matter of the men's scholarly
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Ventris was neither an archaeologist nor a professional
linguist, but a 31-year-old architect; Chadwick, 33, who had
studied Greek and other languages at Cambridge, had worked as a
lowly assistant lexicographer for the Oxford Latin Dictionary
before becoming a classics lecturer at Cambridge in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   But as Chadwick, an incorrigibly modest man, never tired of
pointing out, Ventris was an amateur linguist of genius with a
lifelong interest in cryptography. Ventris had been fascinated with
the Linear B puzzle ever since he was 14 and happened to attend a
lecture given by Evans in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick, a London native who had served in the Navy in World
War II, had only a cursory interest in Linear B until he happened
to turn on the radio in June 1952 and heard an interview in which
Ventris discussed his outrageous theory that Linear B was Greek.
</P>
<P>
   Fascinated, Chadwick wrote to Ventris, and the two men began an
intense collaboration. In a matter of months, they produced a
complete system to decipher the ancient tablets and eventually
translated 300 of them. They were published as ``Documents in
Mycenaean Greek'' in 1956, just weeks before Ventris was killed in
an automobile accident.
</P>
<P>
   By then the discovery of further Linear B tablets on the Greek
mainland, all yielding plausible readings by the Ventris-Chadwick
system, had persuaded almost all scholars that Linear B really was
the earliest form of what evolved into classical Greek.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery that an early form of Greek had been spoken and
written on Crete and elsewhere from about 1400 to 1150 B.C. forced
a vast revision of settled scholarly understanding of the
development of the Greek world.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick, who is survived by his wife, Joan, and a son,
described the detective work in ``The Decipherment of Linear B''
(1958) and became a leading authority on the Mycenaean Greek
language and society, publishing ``Mycenaean World'' in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Although the initial inspiration and the breakthrough were
clearly Ventris', it is generally recognized that Chadwick's
exhaustive knowledge of ancient Greek was indispensable in
developing the complete deciphering system, a contribution that has
often been overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   The entry on Linear B in the Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia,
for example, attributes the discovery to Ventris and makes no
mention of Chadwick, which is hardly surprising _ the entry was
written by Chadwick.

 &HT;    Judiciary allows more time to mold Clinton defense
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee granted the White
House more time to defend President Clinton Sunday, as it appeared
likely that the House would approve at least one article of
impeachment against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Mooney, general counsel to Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde
(R-Ill.), informed White House lawyers that they would be granted
30 hours over the course of two days this week to mount a defense
against allegations that the president lied under oath, obstructed
justice and abused his presidential powers to conceal his affair
with former White House intern Monica Lewinksy.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's request for more time came after Clinton
vote-counters canvassed Republicans and found there appeared to be
enough votes in the House to approve one or more articles of
impeachment against the president. The implications of the request
were not lost on Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that your recent maneuvers may be little more
than an attempt to delay the committee and turn attention away from
the facts before it,'' wrote Mooney to White House Counsels Charles
Ruff and Gregory Craig.
</P>
<P>
   The White House on Sunday accepted Hyde's offer, but they're not
happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who want to pursue the derailment of the president have
not been deterred,'' said Clinton aide Jim Kennedy. ``There's a
chance they will succeed, but we hope to argue that impeachment of
the president is not in the best interest of the country. The
independent counsel spent four years and $40 million investigating
the president. The committee has spent four months doing the same.
Our request for a mere four days has now been cut in half.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Thanksgiving, the impeachment votes seemed to tilt in
favor of averting an impeachment trial by having Clinton face
censure and a fine. But that option seemed to fade after the
president's response to 81 questions posed by the Judiciary
Committee's Republican investigators. Even Democrats have called
Clinton's answers ``evasive'' and ``legalistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His answers to the 81 questions were outrageous,'' said Rep.
Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), a member of the moderate group that
had supported censure over impeachment. ``I mean, he still doesn't
get it. He still doesn't tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome on impeachment now seems up for grabs, with both
sides tallying up different vote counts. This week's high stakes
vote in the Judiciary Committee has thrown Republicans such as
Majority Whip Tom Delay (R-Texas) into action. Delay has been
urging members to send the president and the public a message of
disapproval with their vote.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say they have been told that a vote for impeachment
is more of a symbolic move because the Senate will not remove the
president. But even that is not certain.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said on NBC's ``Meet
the Press'' that he is now preparing for a Senate trial in light of
the likelihood that the House will vote for at least one article of
impeachment. Just last week, he told reporters that he had no plans
for a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Senate will have a trial,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he doesn't want to strike a deal with Clinton to avert
the time-consuming trial, but will allow the constitutional process
to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a lot of latitude here,'' he said. ``I think we
should do a trial if there are articles of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, known for his keen ability to predict vote outcomes, told
CNN on Sunday that he knows of only ``five or six'' Republicans who
will vote against an impeachment resolution in the full House later
this month. And he said those votes will be canceled out by five
Democrats who will vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, outraged that Clinton is not being given as much time
as he needs, say the Republicans are ``railroading the process'' by
making the rank-and-file members of the GOP believe that the
impeachment vote is just a statement of disapproval against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``House Republicans are trying to convince themselves that this
is a routine procedural vote, nothing more than an ultimate rebuke
of the president, that the Senate will bail them out,'' said Jim
Jordan, press secretary to Judiciary Committee Democrats. ``Clearly
this is self-delusional. This is a vote of enormous ramifications
historically, constitutionally and politically. No one gets a free
pass on this vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde held a conference call with Republican members over the
weekend to discuss their options. In a statement, Hyde made it
clear that he intends to finish the panel's work by the end of next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Under the latest plan, the White House will be given from 9 a.m.
until midnight on Tuesday and Wednesday. The committee will hear
from Abbe Lowell, the chief Democratic counsel on Thursday morning
and from Republican Chief Investigative Counsel David Schippers in
the afternoon. Opening statements on articles of impeachment will
begin Thursday night and the debate will continue into Friday and
possibly the weekend. GOP leaders have set aside Dec. 16 and 17 for
votes on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   It would take 218 votes to send the trial to the 100-member
Senate, where a two-thirds majority would be required to remove
Clinton from office. In the current House, which expires next
month, there are 228 Republicans and 206 Democrats and one
independent, who tends to vote with the Democratic side. Three
Democrats have indicated they would support impeachment, which
means that the White House would need 14 Republicans to vote
against the measure in order to defeat it.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has asked the White House to turn over a witness list to
the committee by noon today.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton aide Kennedy identified three witnesses the White House
would like to call: Bruce Ackerman, a constitutional scholar at
Yale University; Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, U.S. Attorney General
during the Johnson administration; and Sean Wilentz, a historian at
Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   And the White House is not the only one asking for more time to
deliberate the facts. California Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren said
she still wants more evidence from independent counsel Kenneth
Starr concerning Julie Hiat Steele. Steele has suggested to
investigators that Starr's office intimidated her by telling her
they would reveal that she improperly adopted a baby from Romania.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has remained silent on the subject despite three letters
from Lofgren. And in an indication that Republicans aren't getting
much cooperation from Starr either, the committee approved a
subpoena last week requesting information about former Democratic
fund raiser John Huang. The committee wants Huang, who has already
been given partial immunity from Starr, to explain $550,000 Huang's
former employer gave to presidential friend Webster Hubbell after
he had left the No. 3 job at the Justice Department.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The area around the Petitions and Appeals Office on
the south side of Beijing looks like any Skid Row. Loitering on
sidewalks, along the sides of a nearby canal and in the lobby of a
train station are hundreds of elderly men and women in frayed,
dirty clothes. In the icy weather they sleep in shoddy tents of
canvas or plastic, and they cook food scrounged from garbage over
open fires and use the streets or the canal for a toilet.
</P>
<P>
   But these are not ordinary derelicts, and the streets are not
littered with broken wine bottles. Carrying on an ancient Chinese
tradition, these sorry-looking people have come from the provinces
with little money but an all-consuming mission: to petition the
supreme rulers for redress of heartfelt grievances _ from alleged
thefts by corrupt local officials to pensions denied.
</P>
<P>
   So many of the street people are elderly because their
complaints, still unresolved, date back to the Cultural Revolution
of 1966 to 1976, when millions who were persecuted by Maoist mobs
lost property, jobs, even their lives. Some petitioners have hung
around the national Petitions and Appeals Office for 20 years,
repeatedly turned down by officials who cannot, at this point, see
how to help them.
</P>
<P>
   A typical petitioner is Dong Xiulan, a 78-year-old woman from
the northeast who appears neatly dressed for a person who has lived
under a bridge for 15 years. She started her quest in the late
1970s, first making trips to Beijing when officials in her home
county refused to help _ ``They acted like Lords, demanding that I
give them money'' _ then moving here for good in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   She says that because of bureaucratic mistakes her husband, a
Communist Party member and a fighter in the People's Liberation
Army in the war against Japanese invaders, was not awarded his
proper pension when he was discharged in the 1950s. Then in 1968,
Red Guards called her husband a ``capitalist roader'' and beat him
to death, she says, leaving her and their three children penniless
and tainted by association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not asking for another life in return for the life of my
husband,'' she said, clutching her husband's army discharge card
and a stack of tattered letters from a succession of offices that
denied they had jurisdiction in the case. ``I'm just asking for the
compensation my husband was entitled to.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she says, the appeals court is refusing to help because she
lacks proper personal documents and cannot afford to get them. But
she continues to make fruitless visits to the office every day and
survives by begging or eating discarded food.
</P>
<P>
   When China lacked a formal legal system, appealing directly to
higher authorities was the main means of seeking redress for
grievances. When the Communists took over in 1949, they continued
the tradition, with formal appeals offices in the provinces and,
for those who were still not satisfied, in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The practice reached a peak in the late 1970s, after Mao's death
and the end of the Cultural Revolution, when hundreds of thousands
of people each year appealed through these offices to have their
political condemnations reversed or to be compensated for lost
property.
</P>
<P>
   Many were successful. But some, for one reason or another,
failed to win their cases. And some, like the tenacious petitioners
living around the appeals office, have never given up trying.
</P>
<P>
   Clustered among the old people with 20-year-old cases, there are
several younger men who recently traveled from villages and keep
busy writing up their petitions. Some said they are here because
corrupt local officials had failed to give them disaster relief
payments they were due.
</P>
<P>
   But resort to this appeals office has dwindled as China has
begun to develop its legal system. More and more, people with any
money or bureaucratic savvy turn to other means _ lawsuits,
exposure in the news media or group demonstrations _ to fight
official mistakes or misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Petitions and Appeals Office, now something of a
backwater, remains besieged with the human flotsam from a period
that many Chinese would just as soon forget. The aging petitioners
persist with the burning quests that consume their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``My complaint is very deeply rooted,'' said Hao Chengyou, 63,
interviewed inside his tent of plastic sheeting under a bridge.
``But if they would even give me half of what I am asking, I would
be satisfied.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hao said he had worked at a petrochemical plant in the
northeast, in Heilongjiang province. But in the 1960s he was laid
off, and then supported his family by selling milk from their cow.
Because of that, in 1967 Red Guards labeled him a ``capitalist
roader,'' took the cow and sent him into the hinterlands.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, Hao has appealed in his home province and in Beijing
for a pension for his years as a state industrial worker, and for
payment for that cow. County officials now deny he ever owned a
cow, he said indignantly. ``The cow was pregnant when they took
it,'' Hao said. ``So they actually owe me for two cows.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun Yuying, 80, was a Communist army veteran, then ran a labor
camp. But he spent 10 years in jail during the Cultural Revolution
because, he says, he praised Deng Xiaoping, who was then in
disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his 20-year quest in Beijing for rehabilitation and
a pension _ which was denied, he says, because local officials lost
his all-important personal file _ he earned enough money selling
scraps picked out of garbage to rent a small room. But two years
ago, as rents jumped, he moved into a canvas lean-to along the
canal.
</P>
<P>
   Sun said he has finally given up. ``I am totally disappointed,''
he said, waving the blue rubber kitchen gloves he wore against the
frigid air. ``If I spend my time at that office, how can I make any
living?''
</P>
<P>
   Why Beijing officials have tolerated these unkempt street people
for so long is something of a mystery. Perhaps, some think, they
feel pity, or even a bit of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone does, though. In a street-side stall selling hats
and gloves near the appeals office, an exasperated vendor waved her
arm toward the petitioners strewn along the sidewalk with their
carts and bags of possessions and said, ``The police should just
get rid of them.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the reason they have been allowed to remain, the
petitioners themselves do not feel grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband fought for the revolution for many years,'' Ms.
Dong said. ``But now nobody has any sympathy for my misfortune.''

OLD CONCERNS OVER DATA TRANSFER TO CHINA GET NEW ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When a Central Intelligence Agency scientist
visited Hughes Electronics Corp. in Los Angeles in 1995 to learn
more about China's missile capabilities, he became concerned that
the satellite manufacturer may have helped improve Chinese military
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The worries of the scientist, Ronald Pandolfi, were not warmly
received back at CIA headquarters, intelligence officials now say,
and the agency killed his study, called a National Intelligence
Estimate.
</P>
<P>
   But today, the information gathered by Pandolfi is part of
various criminal and congressional investigations looking at the
transfer of American space technology to China and, more broadly,
at the intersection of commerce and national security in the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Officials disclosed over the weekend that the Senate
Intelligence Committee had asked the Justice Department to
determine whether the agency had obstructed justice by alerting
Hughes to the Senate panel's recent interest in Pandolfi and the
officials he saw at Hughes in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   CIA officials deny that the agency intended to hinder the Senate
inquiry, and say they helped facilitate Pandolfi's questioning by
investigators. An agency spokesman, Bill Harlow, said the agency
would not talk about Pandolfi's experiences or the 1996 National
Intelligence Estimate he wrote, because of the investigations. The
classified intelligence estimate warned that the transfer of
American satellite technology could contribute to China's ballistic
missile capabilities, other officials said.
</P>
<P>
   CIA officials disagreed with some of Pandolfi's conclusions and
decided that the estimate was not ``rigorous'' enough, one official
said, so it was not published or distributed to other government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   But Pandolfi's warnings may turn out to have been right after
all. The Pentagon and the State Department have now looked at the
same question that bothered Pandolfi three years ago: Did Hughes
help to significantly improve China's military capabilities?
</P>
<P>
   Experts on intelligence and missiles at the two departments have
drafted reports with troubling conclusions, according to officials
familiar with the drafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drafts I've read suggest some pretty serious problems,''
one administration official said. The Pentagon report could be sent
to Congress as early as this week, another official said.
</P>
<P>
   Pandolfi could not be reached Sunday for comment. An official at
Hughes said no one was available Sunday to comment on the inquiry.
But the company, a unit of General Motors, has denied any
wrongdoing in the past and says it is cooperating with the
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, Steven Dorfman, vice chairman of Hughes, told the
Senate subcommittee on proliferation that, in the company's review
of a 1995 explosion of a Chinese rocket carrying a Hughes
satellite, ``no material technology was transmitted to the Chinese
that would help them build missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Pandolfi testified before a closed session of
the Senate Intelligence Committee. His testimony remains secret.
Officials say the agency brought Pandolfi to the committee's
attention, though not immediately.
</P>
<P>
   CIA officials see nothing unusual about disagreements over
complicated intelligence matters. But, other officials said, what
the Senate committee has heard raises questions about whether the
CIA and other agencies or departments of the Clinton administration
have paid too much attention to helping companies like Hughes build
commerce abroad, and not enough attention to national security.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the intelligence analyst begins in January 1995
when a Chinese rocket carrying a Hughes satellite exploded soon
after takeoff. Before long, a newspaper in Hong Kong controlled by
the Chinese government suggested that the accident had been caused
by Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes thought the Chinese were to blame, but some officials
were reluctant to bluntly confront the Chinese for fear of
offending an important customer, a former Hughes executive said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear exactly what Hughes told the Chinese, but the
satellite manufacturer agreed to help Chinese scientists and
engineers figure out what went wrong in the January launching.
Hughes sought and received permission from the Commerce Department
before it undertook the accident review.
</P>
<P>
   The expertise and technology needed to put a satellite into
orbit are similar to what is needed to deliver weapons from a
ballistic missile. China's civilian rocket and space program is run
by the same government-controlled companies that develop and sell
ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   There were no Pentagon monitors present at Hughes' 1995 accident
review because satellites licensed by the Commerce Department did
not always require such a presence. Pandolfi was alarmed when he
heard on his Los Angeles trip about what had transpired in the
accident review, an associate recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they told him they were sharing and how far the company
had been willing to go, he thought it was questionable from the
standpoint of national security,'' the associate said.
</P>
<P>
   But the analyst's concerns never went very far after the agency
killed the intelligence estimate he drafted in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But this year it was revealed that a federal grand jury was
investigating whether Hughes and another American space company,
Loral Space and Communications, had gone too far in assisting the
Chinese after another rocket failure, this one in 1996, with a
Loral satellite on board.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Soon, the grand jury and various congressional committees became
curious about the earlier accident review by Hughes. The Commerce
Department acknowledged to Congress that the license for that
review should have been approved by the State Department, which has
authority over all defense services or equipment _ and which
requires Pentagon monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Dorfman told the Senate that, in hindsight, the Pentagon
monitors ``should have been there,'' at the 1995 accident review.
In 1995 the chairman of Hughes, C. Michael Armstrong, was leading
the fight to persuade President Clinton to shift jurisdiction over
satellites from the more restrictive State Department to Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal inquiry is now focusing, among other things, on
whether Hughes knew or should have known it was required to get
State Department approval before helping the Chinese in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   After the news accounts earlier this year, Pandolfi spoke with
federal and congressional investigators. CIA officials say the
agency helped arrange those interviews after some delay, one
official said. When the intelligence committee wanted to further
explore the issue with Hughes, the agency alerted the satellite
maker, but, within 24 hours, had also informed the committee about
its heads-up to Hughes, one official said.
</P>
<P>
   The concern of Congress involves broad issues of national
security. It was the Senate panel on proliferation that asked the
Pentagon to assess the national security implications of the 1995
accident review. And the Senate intelligence committee, officials
said, is looking at whether what happened to Pandolfi is part of a
larger question: Has the Clinton administration's strategic
partnership with Beijing affected the way the intelligence
community sees China?

<P>
   WEST CHESTER, Pa. _ Nick Polidore, a state gymnastics champion
with bangs, dimples and baggy blue jeans, would seem as robust as
any other 11-year-old. But he has asthma, so ragweed or a simple
cold can propel him to an emergency room, gasping for breath.
</P>
<P>
   Once, an asthma attack would keep him in a hospital for a day or
two. But since his family doctor here, Brandt S. Loev, took up
disease management, a system for controlling chronic conditions
like asthma, the big emergencies have stopped _ and so have the big
bills to his mother's health insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Disease management sounds familiar, even common-sensical. On
each office visit, Loev checks Nick's breathing and health
completely and then an aide teaches him how to avoid attacks, how
to use inhalers, how to test his lungs himself with a simple
bedside device the clinic gave him.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, this is what managed care was supposed to do:
cut costs by keeping people healthy. Instead, health management
organizations and insurance companies concentrated on cutting
costs, especially by reducing doctors' fees.
</P>
<P>
   But now that those methods have played out and in many cases
profits evaporated, some health care organizations are looking to
better medical practice as an answer. The new remedy is managing
chronic diseases, which account for 60 percent of medical costs in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next phase has to be managing care better and disease
management is another word for that,'' said Uwe S. Reinhardt, a
health care economist at Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   The movement is breeding as many as 300 companies that contract
with health maintenance organizations and employers to supervise
the care of people with chronic diseases. The revenue of these
companies is expected to double over the next year, to $348
million, said Al Lewis, a broker who negotiates contracts for the
companies with health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 1,000 HMOs that belong to the American Association of
Health Plans, at least 150 are collaborating with the American
Diabetes Association in a 10-year disease management program that
aims to reduce blindness and foot amputations among diabetics by 40
percent and kidney failure by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One leader in the movement is the University of Pennsylvania
Health Center, which offers management programs for 20 chronic
conditions through its 85 clinics in and around Philadelphia,
including Loev's clinic in West Chester. In September, it licensed
VHA Inc., a group of more than 1,200 nonprofit hospitals, including
Columbia Presbyterian in New York, to use its programs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's talking about it,'' said Dr. Joseph Carver,
disease management medical director for Aetna U.S. Healthcare,
which has enrolled nearly 59,000 members in programs that include
those for managing congestive heart failure and low back pain.
``Everybody says they're doing it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But disease management is still a small part of health care, and
it is not clear whether it will gain wide acceptance among doctors,
some of whom belittle it as ``cookbook medicine.'' They see their
control of health care threatened, in part by lower-paid
technicians, or disease managers, typically nurses with advanced
training.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates warn that disease management can be abused,
most obviously by HMOs and the disease management companies that
are thriving by taking on chronic conditions like asthma that
promise quick savings while shunning those like hypertension that
can take a decade or more to yield savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot of enthusiasm for this as a way of solving some
serious problems,'' said John M. Eisenberg, administrator of the
Federal Agency for Health Care Policy and Research and a proponent
of disease management. ``What we all have to be worried about is
whether the emperor has any clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars like Reinhardt say the University of Pennsylvania's
2-year-old program is promising. Disease management permeates the
university's Mayfair Family Practice in northeast Philadelphia,
which serves an aging population of patients, many with multiple
ailments, in a blue-collar neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say 90 percent of the people who come in here have
some form of chronic disease,'' said Winifred Waters, the
nurse-manager. ``We have a lot of nuns who are on Medicare, and
every nun has severe osteoporosis.''
</P>
<P>
   For 18 years she and her husband, Dr. Patrick T. Waters, a
family practitioner, operated the clinic alone. Like most health
professionals, they kept abreast of advances in care by reading
medical journals and attending conferences. But as managed care
spread and cut their fees, their income plunged. They had to see
more patients, faster, which left little time for comprehensive
treatment of chronic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, they sold the practice to the University of
Pennsylvania Health System and became salaried employees, with two
younger doctors. Early last year, they began working under the
system's disease management guidelines, or protocols.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of how the arrangement works, Waters said, he
pointed to a package of a medication, Niaspran, a new prescription
drug to lowe cholesterol, which a drug company's salesman had left
as a sample.
</P>
<P>
   Niaspran is a form of niacin, which is sold over the counter,
and is released over an extended time in the body. Niacin can cause
severe flushing, making people feel hot and reddening their faces.
The salesman said Niaspran had less severe side effects.
</P>
<P>
   In his own practice, Waters said, he would not have prescribed
Niaspran until he had enough research to support its use. But he
e-mailed a University of Pennsylvania expert on the management of
high cholesterol, Dr. Dan Rader, asking him about the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Rader checked with the Food and Drug Administration, which
endorsed it, and so Rader then added it to the university's
one-page protocol for niacin therapy.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest change brought by disease management, Waters
said, is the advent of the university's circuit-riding nurse
educators, each specializing in specific diseases.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Thursday, five older patients were in the clinic's
kitchen for a noon class on diabetes, instructed by Patricia
Bourne, diabetes educator and disease manager.
</P>
<P>
   Bourne conducts these classes and individual counseling sessions
with new patients and those who need special attention. Patients
can call her for help, and every month or two, University of
Pennsylvania nurses call patients. If a nurse detects a problem,
she calls in Bourne.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very new,'' one patient, Audrey Grubman, said. ``I met
with Pat on a one-to-one basis in June and July. My doctor told me
a lot of these things, but she reinforces it. She keeps it in front
of your mind to take better care of yourself.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Waters says Bourne is a boon to him, too. He still sees patients
in quick, 10- and 15-minute visits. ``But this allows me to do more
of what I'm best at doing,'' he said. It also pays. Waters' bonus
depends in part on holding down his patients' need for surgery and
emergency treatment of heart attacks and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to both improving health and reducing costs, says Dr.
David S. Shulkin, the University of Pennsylvania's s health system
medical director, lies in making good medicine, not cutting costs,
the priority. ``We're implementing best practices,'' he said, ``and
letting the economics sort itself out.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, disease management seems to work. Shulkin said that of
1,547 university patients with hypertension, only 19 percent had
blood pressure readings at or below 140/90 when they enrolled in
the program, but 53 percent achieved those levels afterward. Of
1,497 with adult diabetes, 40 percent had safe levels of blood
sugar before enrollment; afterward, the figure was 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some management programs that affect large numbers of people,
like one for high cholesterol, can cost more to operate than they
save. ``But when you balance out the winners and losers,'' Shulkin
said, ``it turns out to be a significant cost-saver overall.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>

   nn
</P>
<P>
   Pediatric asthma care seems to be a winner at the university's
West Chester clinic. Before Loev examined Nick Polidore, the
resident disease management coordinator and patient educator, Wendy
York, retrieved the boy's chart. It had a blue dot for asthma
pasted on it, which told her to collect specialized forms to guide
Loev through his examination. The forms leave little to chance or
intuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a protocol,'' Loev said, ``so we're consistent in
treating all patients all the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Then York takes over. ``I'd like to get a pulmonary function,''
she tells Nick. Wiry, weighing about 80 pounds, Nick is a little
lethargic three days after a mild attack. He stands, takes a deep
breath and blows into a spirometer. His reading is a little worse
than his best.
</P>
<P>
   York counsels him, as she does on each visit, in using inhalers,
nebulizers and bronchodilators and in giving himself emergency
epinephrine shots to open breathing passages. She has him show her
how he blows into a peak flow meter, a plastic pipe that measures
his breathing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do a peak flow,'' said his mother, Sharon Polidore,
``you can see if you're not getting enough air in.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick has mastered his part in managing his disease. ``He's a
classic case,'' Loev said. ``Our emergency room costs are lower.
Our hospital costs are lower. Our specialist costs are lower. The
patient is much more in control. And the patient who comes in isn't
as sick.''

SETBACK FOR NETANYAHU COALITION AS LEVY REJECTS OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ David Levy, the former foreign minister, announced
Sunday night that he would not rejoin the Israeli Cabinet,
potentially foiling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's latest
effort to shore up his fragile coalition.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Levy's announcement was simply the latest
tactic in negotiations that began almost two weeks ago, when
Netanyahu offered to give Levy a leading role if he would bring his
five-member Gesher parliamentary group back into the prime
minister's camp.
</P>
<P>
   If it is the final word, however, it could have devastating
implications for Netanyahu, who has been scrambling to hold
together his right-wing coalition since he signed a
land-for-security accord with the Palestinians in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Party leader, Ehud Barak, indicated Sunday that if the
deal with Levy fell through, Labor might call for a vote on Monday
to dissolve the parliament and to set a date for early elections _
after the October plan is carried out. With Levy and his Gesher
party, such a proposal would have a majority, Labor officials said.
</P>
<P>
   This raises the possibility of a crisis for Netanyahu's
governing coalition just six days before a visit by President
Clinton to Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate but related issue, Israeli radio and television
reported Sunday night that a majority of Cabinet ministers had
agreed that Clinton should be pressed to postpone his visit, which
many see as an endorsement of Palestinian sovereignty. The
ministers' motivation was not the Levy affair, but renewed tensions
between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli said again last week that it would freeze steps to carry
out the October accord unless the Palestinians met certain demands,
including the renunciation of plans to announce a state next May.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton himself should reconsider the timing of his
visit,'' said Yehoshua Matza, the minister of health.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's office downplayed Levy's announcement,
signaling that negotiations to bring him back into the government
would continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime minister believes that there is a basis for
returning Levy and the Gesher faction to the Likud, and therefore
he continues in his efforts to do so,'' said Aviv Bushinsky,
Netanyahu's media adviser. ``The prime minister believes that Levy
could contribute to the government from his experience and help it
especially during this period.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that political survival is more important than
ideology, Netanyahu, an avowed proponent of fiscal restraint, had
been prepared to give Levy, a champion of social spending, the plum
job of finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister originally offered Levy either the Finance
Ministry or the National Iinfrastructures Ministry, and it appeared
at first that Levy would accept the latter. But there followed some
public questioning of Levy's motives and abilities _ including a
blistering skit on the influential weekly satire program,
``Hartzufim,'' in which Levy was portrayed as a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Levy, a professed advocate for the working class,
called a news conference to announce he had chosen the Finance
Ministry. Prices on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange immediately dipped,
and they rallied Sunday when it appeared that the Levy deal would
fall through.
</P>
<P>
   Yaakov Neeman, the current finance minister, is a professional
appointee who has kept a tight lid on the kind of social spending
that Levy advocates. He said last week that he would step down if
it would help save the government from collapse.
</P>
<P>
   In reaching out to Levy, Netanayhu seemed to be marshaling his
resources to clear a serious political hurdle _ the always
contentious budget vote, which he keeps delaying.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, a white-haired political veteran, resigned as foreign
minister after the last budget was passed in January. Denouncing
the Netanyahu administration as aimless, he criticized the lack of
social spending and the stalemate in the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Political associates said Levy considered returning because he
felt politically sidelined and saw no future for his small party.
Gesher broke away from Likud in 1992 to concentrate on social
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, who was born in Morocco, courted Sephardic Jews from there
and other Arab countries but they were instead drawn to Shas, the
burgeoning third party of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Levy was said to have felt particularly defeated after the
municipal elections a month ago, when his son lost the mayoral
election in the town where Levy began his political career.
</P>
<P>
   When Netanyahu invited him back to the Cabinet, it was seen as a
preparatory step for a unity government with the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But negotiations over the merger of Gesher into Likud stumbled
when some Likud leaders balked. And after it was reported that Levy
was making budget demands that Netanyahu felt could not be
accommodated, rumors flew that the prime minister was looking for a
way to rescind his invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have reached the inevitable conclusion that the prime
minister's offer was a sham,'' Levy said Sunday night, referring to
the rumors. ``I will not rejoin this government.''
</P>
<P>
   Even his associates, however, would not pronounce this the end
of the idea.

   RAFAH, Gaza Strip _ Cruising at 19,000 feet on Saturday in the
cockpit of the first Palestinian Airlines flight to depart from
Gaza's new international airport, Capt. Jamal Al-How from the
Jabaliya refugee camp could not restrain himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this historic moment, taking off for the first time in
history from a Palestinian airport, all the languages of the world
cannot express my pride and joy,'' he declared. ``I thank the
heroic Palestinian people, which sacrificed everything it had so
that we could reach this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, applause rang through the cabin as the 48-seat Fokker
50 propeller plane, painted with the Palestinian national colors of
red, green, black and white, took to the air. Mohammad Abdel Salam
from Bethlehem, the steward, greeted the passengers of Flight 152,
inaugurating regular service from the Gaza airport, which was
ceremonially opened last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome aboard the first flight from Yasser Arafat
International Airport, bound for Amman,'' Abdel Salam said over the
loudspeaker. ``Thank you for choosing Palestinian Airlines, and we
wish you all a pleasant flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed. In the not-too-distant past, the combination
of the words ``Palestinian'' and ``airplane'' evoked images of
gun-waving hijackers from the PLO. Now the Palestinians are running
their own airline from Gaza, with planes flown by former PLO
pilots, and Palestinian security men checking bags and passengers
for would-be terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1996, the tiny Palestinian airline was an
outgrowth of the accords with Israel on Palestinian self-rule. It
has two Fokker 50s received from the Netherlands, and a Boeing 727
donated by Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, which is still
being prepared for service.
</P>
<P>
   Starting operations in 1997 without a home airport, the
airline's first flights left from Port Said in Egypt, ferrying
Muslim pilgrims to Saudi Arabia. Regular service began a few months
later from the Egyptian town of El Arish to Amman and to the Saudi
Arabian city of Jidda. Departing passengers had to make a
night-long trek by bus from Gaza to El Arish, moving slowly through
Palestinian, Israeli and Egyptian checkpoints to board flights that
took far less time than the ground journey.
</P>
<P>
   Flying from Gaza for the first time on Saturday, passengers
remarked on the simple convenience of going directly from home to
their local airport, avoiding Israeli interrogations and security
checks at border crossings and at Ben-Gurion airport near Tel Aviv,
Israel. It enhanced their sense that, while there was no
Palestinian state yet, something like one was emerging from the
often-troubled negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove here with my family, like anyone else in the world,''
said Ahmad al-Ghandour, a department head in the Palestinian
Authority. ``I'm leaving like people do everywhere else, on your
own plane, with your own passport.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahfouz Othman, a psychiatrist from Rafah, said that he was
relieved of the anxiety that often plagued his departures in the
past, when he was worried that he might be turned back or detained.
``I feel that I'm keeping my dignity; these are Palestinians like
us,'' he said as he handed his passport to a Palestinian police
officer. ``At a personal, human level, this is a changing point in
our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Not entirely. A short while after Othman spoke, Palestinian
security officers and Israeli counterparts keeping watch at the
airport got into a dispute about departure procedures, delaying
take-off for three-and-a-half hours.
</P>
<P>
   Fayez Zaidan, the airline chairman, came to the passenger lounge
to encourage his customers. ``We are with you facing the
Israelis,'' he told them. ``This is your airport.'' In the end, the
passengers were bused to the adjacent Rafah border terminal where
they went through passport control under Israeli supervision,
before returning to the plane. A few hours later, returning
passengers were delayed two hours at the same terminal for Israeli
security and document checks.
</P>
<P>
   But the first-day hitches did not mar the patriotic spirit on
the first flight from Gaza, and its passengers were greeted with
roses in Amman. Regular flights to Jidda and Cairo, Egypt, are
scheduled to start in the next few days. The airline expects to
carry thousands to the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia in
March, and there are long-range plans to expand service to Cyprus,
Turkey and Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always imagined that it would come,'' said Zaidan, who is
also head of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority. ``There were
many obstacles and difficulties. I'm very happy that I could
achieve this goal of establishing a civil aviation authority from
zero, an airport from zero, an airline from zero. We did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has sent some of its 400 employees to train in
Morocco and Jordan, but the core of its crews and staff served in
what was once the air wing of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, or worked in airlines in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians also gained experience in the 1980s in Maldives
Airways, which was effectively owned by the PLO, and in Air Bissau,
a government-owned carrier in Africa in which the PLO was a major
partner.
</P>
<P>
   When it was still a guerrilla movement, the PLO sent volunteers
to flight academies in Pakistan and Yugoslavia, and in the 1980s,
Palestinian fighter pilots served in the air forces of Syria, Libya
and Yemen. The PLO air fleet consisted then of small transport
planes and helicopters, used mostly for travel between the
organization's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any revolution struggling for freedom, we were fighting
for the liberation of Palestine,'' said Yassin al-Hawamdi, a pilot.
``Now we're building up a state.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, Palestinians do not control their skies.
Take-offs and landings must be reported to the Israelis. Flights
from Gaza are barred from crossing Israel's southern air-space
because there are military installations en route, compelling
flights to Amman to detour over the Sinai peninsula, meaning that
they take about 90 minutes. Sophisticated landing equipment is
still being held in an Israeli port, and planes only land and take
off at the Gaza airport in daylight.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for the Palestinian Airlines staff, operating their national
carrier from their soil is a source of great satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have traveled everywhere, to 70 countries,'' said Abdel
Salam, the steward, who worked 15 years for Kuwait Airways. ``Now I
feel different. I'm taking care of my own people. We waited a long
time to realize our dream.''

MONITORS CALL NIGERIAN VOTE FAIR, WITH ROOM TO IMPROVE
</HEADLINE>
   (rm)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Despite widespread logistical problems in
voting, officials who monitored Nigeria's local government
elections on Saturday described them on Sunday as a positive step
toward the presidential elections in February.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the elections for 774 municipal governments were
still being tallied Sunday, although reports from across the
country suggested that the three leading parties had performed
according to expectations. Foreign monitors estimated the voter
turnout at 20 percent, a figure they described as good given the
local nature of Saturday's contests and the dismal turnouts during
rigged elections under the late dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   Monitors said there were few reports of violence. A notable
exception was in the impoverished Niger Delta region, where 10
people were killed in skirmishes related to the elections, Nigerian
newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
   The elections provided the first glimpse into how fair
presidential elections might be in a country that has been ruled by
military governments for all but four years since 1966. Several
organizations from the West, as well as local ones, sent observers
throughout this country of 108 million people to oversee ballots,
which were often cast on street corners, under trees, in private
homes or simply along roadsides under a scorching midday sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some evident problems, but we did see some places
that had excellent procedures that could be copied anywhere else,''
said K. Srinivasan, leader of a monitoring team for the
Commonwealth of Britain and its former colonies. The Commonwealth
suspended Nigeria in 1995 after Abacha ordered the execution of the
writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. ``I'm confident that the problems will be
evaluated and resolved in time for the presidential elections,''
Srinivasan said.
</P>
<P>
   Clement Nwankwo, chairman of the Transition Monitoring Group, an
organization of 45 Nigerian groups monitoring the elections, said
that he had received consistent reports from his group's 600
monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some problems that there were shortages of voting
material and mix-ups of voter registration lists,'' Nwankwo said.
``But they were not considered significant enough that the
elections could not be considered free and fair.''
</P>
<P>
   After Abacha's unexpected death in June, his successor, Gen.
Abdulsalami Abubakar, announced that Nigeria would hold local,
statewide and presidential elections _ one set each month starting
in December. Abubakar, who is not running for president, has
pledged that the military will hand over power to a civilian
government next May.
</P>
<P>
   He created the Independent National Electoral Commission by
decree to run the elections. To respond to concerns about fraud _
20 million of 60 million voters' cards disappeared, for example _
several safeguards were taken on Saturday, including sealing
Nigeria's borders during voting hours.
</P>
<P>
   But foreign monitors said that some practices followed on
Saturday needed to be improved for the presidential elections. Many
officials presiding at polling places appeared poorly trained and
arrived late, the monitors said. And at many polling places, it was
possible to see how individuals voted because ballots were cast out
in the open.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week's election is not a watershed,'' said Thomas Melia,
vice president of the National Democratic Institute, which is
monitoring the elections. ``It's a time for testing. The
significance of the voting will become clear when we see what
improvements are made in subsequent elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The Independent National Electoral Commission said it will
release final results this week. But preliminary figures and
reports suggested that the People's Democratic Party had won the
highest number of local seats nationwide. The party is centrist and
has the best-known presidential candidate in Gen. Olusegun
Obasanjo, a former president and the only military ruler to have
given up power to a civilian government.
</P>
<P>
   Two other parties, the All People's Party and the Alliance for
Democracy, were expected to muster enough votes in 24 of the 36
states to present candidates in statewide and presidential
elections. Turnout is expected to rise for those elections, though
monitors and party officials said they were encouraged by
Saturday's turnout, especially since few bothered to vote in
manipulated elections under Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is so clear,'' said Nat Yaduma, a leader in the
People's Democratic Party in Adamawa state in central Nigeria.
``More people are participating because of the credibility of the
election process.''
</P>
<P>
   As results were announced in wards in Lagos starting on Saturday
night, candidates and supporters could be seen celebrating,
carrying winners aloft through the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The victory is a sweet one, a very sweet one,'' said Akanni
Sanni Mojeed, 56, who won a district chairmanship in Lagos for the
Alliance for Democracy.

REPUBLICANS OFFER CLINTON LAWYERS 2 DAYS FOR DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: See also IMPEACH-PRECEDENT.) 
(rm) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Setting the stage for this week's impeachment vote
in the House Judiciary Committee, Republicans on the panel on
Sunday offered President Clinton's lawyers two full days for their
defense, but underscored a commitment to end the inquiry by year's
end.
</P>
<P>
   In a testy letter Sunday to the White House counsels, Thomas E.
Mooney, the judiciary panel's chief of staff and general counsel,
said Clinton's lawyers would be granted 30 hours over Tuesday and
Wednesday to make their case before the panel, which hopes to
conclude the inquiry by Saturday. The White House had requested
four days to defend the president.
</P>
<P>
   And Mooney instructed the White House to abide by inquiry rules
and submit a written request and summary by noon Monday that lists
the witnesses it wants to present, and reasons for calling them, an
attempt by Congress to keep a tight rein on the proceedings and
blunt any political theatrics. Once the paperwork is received, Rep.
Henry Hyde of Illinois, the chairman of the judiciary panel, will
act on the request.
</P>
<P>
   Mooney, in his letter to Charles Ruff and Gregory Craig, the
White House counsels, also chastised the White House for what he
considers the political gamesmanship leading up to this week's
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have consistently ignored the rules adopted by the
committee; rules that you have been aware of for nearly two
months,'' Mooney wrote. ``Once again, you have failed to comply
with the committee procedures and demonstrated contempt for the
committee's process. I am concerned that your recent maneuvers may
be little more than an attempt to delay the committee and turn
attention away from the facts before it.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House late Sunday responded to the panel's
instructions with equal indignity. ``The independent counsel spent
four years and $40 million investigating the president,'' said
James E. Kennedy, special adviser to the White House counsel. ``The
committee is spending four months doing the same. Our request for
just four days has now been cut in half. Nevertheless, we will work
to defend the president despite these restrictions. We will respond
formally to the committee tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has identified three possible witnesses:
Nicholas Katzenbach, attorney general in the Johnson
administration; Bruce Ackerman, a Yale Law School constitutional
scholar, and Sean Wilentz, a Princeton University historian.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four months after the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr,
delivered his report of possible impeachable offenses to the House,
the Judiciary Committee will launch the final chapter of its
factious inquiry this week, debating the merits of impeachment
before taking its vote.
</P>
<P>
   There remains little doubt that the panel, controlled by
Republicans, will vote to impeach Clinton for his behavior in the
Lewinsky scandal and hand the House at lease one article of
impeachment, which could include perjury and obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   The pivotal battle will come the following week, when the full
House is expected to decide whether to impeach Clinton, a vote that
is still too close to call. That vote is now expected to be held on
Dec. 16 or 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that it's about a 50-50 proposition right now,''
Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the chief Republican vote counter and
impeachment advocate, said during an appearance on ``Fox News
Sunday.'' ``I think if we voted today the president will be
impeached, but I think it weighs very heavily on the case to be
presented by the committee next week and a lot of members are going
to look at this.''
</P>
<P>
   Just one month ago, it seemed all but certain that Clinton would
escape the 11-month scandal with a slap on the wrist. Mid-term
election losses by the Republicans appeared to strip impeachment of
any momentum in the House.
</P>
<P>
   But that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment question is likely to be decided by a number of
Republican moderates who remain troubled by the notion of
impeachment and would prefer to censure the president, a move
pushed by Democrats that would be acceptable to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republican moderates concede that the move toward
censure is losing out to impeachment. They say Clinton is
responsible for giving impeachment this new momentum, and cite his
responses to 81 questions sent by the Judiciary Committee. Those
answers were deemed by Republicans and even a few Democrats to be
one exercise too many in arrogance and overly legalistic denials of
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the president pretty much stiffed the Congress, then I
think a number have said, `No. I may vote for impeachment now,' ''
Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut, one of the few Republican
members who openly opposes impeachment, said on ABC's ``This Week
with Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts.'' ``His answers to the 81
questions were outrageous. He still doesn't get it. He still
doesn't tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have also criticized Clinton for what they believe
is an effort to stall the proceedings until next year, when
Republicans will hold an even slimmer majority.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, it has been DeLay's position that has
gained momentum, despite claims that he has not used his power as a
majority whip to pressure colleagues to vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   It will take 218 votes in the House to send articles of
impeachment to the Senate, which then sits in judgment. Delay said
he has counted five Republicans who will vote against impeachment
and said he is aware of five or six Democrats who will vote for it.
Republicans hold an 11-vote majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The recent turnaround in sentiment has prompted the White House
to scramble for votes and hash out a new defense strategy, and
White House lawyers were meeting late Sunday to decide their
course. A penitent White House performance on Tuesday and
Wednesday, when Clinton's lawyers will appear before the Judiciary
Committee, could help sway Republican moderates who are undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the full House ultimately votes to impeach Clinton, it
is highly unlikely that the Senate, which has expressed deeper
reservations about impeachment, would vote to remove the president.
It takes 67 out of 100 votes to remove a president from office.
Republicans hold 55 seats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Sunday that if
the Senate receives articles of impeachment, it would hold a trial.
``Do we have to?'' Lott asked on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' ``I
don't think absolutely, but I think that it would be hard not to do
that if the House votes one or more articles.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott also said he envisioned a relatively short trial with a
tight focus, most likely to begin after the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see it taking just a few days to perhaps a few
weeks,'' Lott said. ``But I _ again, it will depend on what they do
and how the articles are offered and what the will of the Senate is
in line with the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Republicans on the Judiciary Committee are expected
to gather behind closed doors to plan strategy for this week's
events and continue drafting articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, after the White House has made its case from 9 a.m.
to midnight on Tuesday and Wednesday, the chief investigative
counsel for the Democrats, Abbe Lowell, will make his presentation,
followed by the Republican counsel, David Schippers. Debate will
likely begin Friday, followed by a vote on Saturday.

ANALYSIS: U.S. SEEMS READY TO ACCEPT A U.N. REVIEW OF IRAQI
SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just weeks after it went to the brink of military action against
Iraq, the United States now appears willing to go along with a
consensus on the U.N. Security Council and grant a comprehensive
review of the sanctions against Saddam Hussein even if he has not
cooperated fully with arms inspectors, diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   For months Washington has insisted that Iraq must show full
cooperation with arms inspections before Baghdad can have any hope
of such a review. But now, while Iraq is still far from total
compliance, both the Iraqis and their strongest critics have
apparently decided that there is more to gain in staging a review
than in igniting a new confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has doggedly pursued the idea of a review in hopes that it
will accelerate the lifting of a crippling oil embargo. On Sunday
the official Iraqi press repeated the demand that the review begin
soon, since inspectors have been back at work on routine tasks in
Iraq for more than two weeks. They had been idled for months by
Iraqi noncooperation.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, the United States and Britain believe that a
review will prove yet again that Iraq still has much to answer for
about its banned weapons programs. Such an outcome would strengthen
the U.S. policy of keeping sanctions in place indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to authorize the review could come as early as next
week, when Richard Butler, the executive chairman of the U.N.
Special Commission, which has been charged with disarming Iraq,
reports to the council about recent inspections. Diplomats say that
the review would then probably begin in January, although details
have yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   The review would be the first of its kind and be designed to
look at all relevant resolutions and requirements set on Iraq since
its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Previous reviews were narrowly
focused to assess Iraqi compliance at six-month intervals. It is
also likely to be used to spell out exactly what more the Iraqis
must do before sanctions can be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis are hoping that once the Security Council takes a
broad view it will see in effect that Iraq has met a majority of
requirements, no longer poses a threat and can be dealt with
through far less intrusive, long-term monitoring regime.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. view, diplomats say, is that the review will backfire
on the Iraqis. If the Iraqis want a ``comprehensive'' review, they
note, that is exactly what they may get.
</P>
<P>
   Such a review would provide an opportunity to hold Baghdad
accountable for a broad range of transgressions since the gulf war,
including the failure to pay compensation to Kuwait or to return
stolen Kuwaiti property, and a deplorable human rights record.
These grievances are in addition to the charge of harboring
programs to make weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis, on the other hand, will focus on a narrow definition
of compliance aimed specifically at the lifting of the oil embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is taking place despite Iraq's refusal to hand over
documents demanded by Butler's commission. The International Atomic
Energy Agency, which monitors Iraqi nuclear programs, has also been
denied documents, independent arms control experts say.
</P>
<P>
   But one Western diplomat noted last week, ``It's pretty clear
that nobody wants to go to war over documents.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Russia's envoy, Sergei Lavrov, added that he thought
a number of Security Council members had serious questions about
the importance, or even the existence, of some of the documents
being sought.
</P>
<P>
   Envoys from a cross-section of council members say that no
nation wants a conflict during the year-end holidays and the Muslim
holy month of Ramadan. Neither does anyone want to conduct the
review, which is expected to be a complicated survey of Iraq's
relations with the United Nations, during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis are also prepared to accept a January timetable,
Lavrov said, because despite their calls for an immediate review,
the Iraqis want the Security Council's full attention and many
diplomats take time off during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, arrived in Moscow on
Sunday for talks with Russian officials, two days after Butler
visited Moscow at Russia's request. Russia is expected to take the
lead in pressing Iraq's case at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Since Saddam allowed the inspectors to return last month, they
have expanded their activities in Iraq. But the inspectors have so
far avoided provoking a showdown over any one of a number of sites
the Iraqis consider sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   No Security Council member is pressing for a confrontation,
prompting Scott Ritter, the U.S. concealment expert who resigned
from the Special Commission in August, to write in an article in
the current issue of The New Republic that the resumed inspections
are a ``sham.''
</P>
<P>
   In this atmosphere, threats from the United States and Britain,
countries that went to the brink of war to force Saddam to back
down in mid-November, have all but ended, although officials in
both countries continue to warn Iraq that an attack can never be
ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has made the same point in
recent days during a tour of Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis have apparently decided to postpone accounting for
disputed documents until a review takes place, when they can argue
with the support of Russia, France, China and several countries
that hold rotating council seats that the documents are unimportant
or irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans and British, on the other hand, say that they have
recent history on their side. For more than a year, Iraq has been
demanding reviews of its biological, chemical and missile programs.
On every occasion, international experts, including Russian,
Chinese and French scientists, have refused to accept Iraqi
explanations for missing material.
</P>
<P>
   If a comprehensive review ends with similar results, the
Americans and British will be in a stronger position to keep
sanctions in place without resorting to military action, at least
in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq hopes to see a review end with the lifting of the oil
embargo imposed after the August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Other
sanctions like bans on air travel and the freezing of assets could
be lifted later as other requirements are met.
</P>
<P>
   Security Council resolutions say, however, that all prohibited
weapons systems must be adequately accounted for before the oil
embargo is removed. At the moment, even if nuclear, chemical and
missile systems are cleared of major suspicions, the Iraqi
biological weapons program poses huge problems, and these are not
likely to disappear in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   While American and British statements on Iraq have been subdued
lately, the two governments are working hard at the same time to
undermine Saddam's confidence if not his regime by pressing Iraqi
exile groups to step up and coordinate their activities against
Baghdad, leaders of these groups say.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, exiles said in interviews this week, is also
broadening its appeal to Saddam's opponents by trying to bring
Shiite Muslim opponents who operate in southern Iraq from bases in
Iran into a concerted effort to undermine the Baghdad government,
along with Kurdish groups in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Some exiles are skeptical of this plan, saying that Iran is not
ready to give the Iraqis based there the go-ahead to join a
movement that will be assumed to have the support of the United
States.

TELL THE COMPETITORS THERE'S NO CRYING IN CAR WASHES
</HEADLINE>

   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ If there's one thing Lenny Dykstra hasn't
forgotten from his baseball days, it's how to steal when you need
to win a game.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Dykstra's Car Wash and Auto Repair _ as opposed to an auto
wash and car repair _ busted open over the weekend in Simi Valley
with an autograph-studded celebration.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of several squeegee shrines around Southern California
that the former New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies All-Star
center fielder has erected with his baseball fortunes and chewing
tobacco endorsement cash.
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner from Lenny's place on Los Angeles Street, the
workers at The First Street Car Wash tried to keep busy by buffing
away the new competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But here's where Dykstra has an edge.
</P>
<P>
   First Street can only do about 50 cars an hour _ maybe 60 tops,
confided one Dykstra employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the size of our place, we can do 80 an hour,'' he
said. ``Easy.''
</P>
<P>
   How does the wishing-to-remain anonymous man with the new Lenny
Dykstra Car Wash polo shirt (selling for $15.95 in the gift shop,
next to the vanillaroma air fresheners) know all this? He was one
of the guys lured over from First Street to work for Mr. Nails.
</P>
<P>
   So was his boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not real happy with us over there,'' he said with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   First Street hasn't given up its home turf so fast. It
advertises a $6.95 regular wash special _ on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny's quick-wash (known as a ``single'') runs $7.95. For a
buck more, a ``double'' gets you sealer wax, air freshener (we'll
take regal pine, thanks) and polish conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   Stretch it to a ``triple'' for $11.95 and there's a triple-shine
wax, under-carriage wash and tire dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the ``home run'' wash for $16.95. Lenny will throw
in (with whatever arm he has left) all of the above, plus exterior
dressing, clear-coat wax and wheel service, plus a free individual
pizza or gourmet coffee from his snack stand over in the dry-off
area.
</P>
<P>
   A complete car detail, by the way, starts at $119.95, so that's
just a ballpark figure.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with any auto repair, Lenny gives a free wash and
wax. First Street, next to the Just Tires store, doesn't even do
auto repair.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just good, sound, fundamental business, right? Or, as
the Dykstra motto reads: ``We're In A League of Our Own.'' &QL;

WITH `A LOT OF LUCK,' JETS WIN ONE IN DECEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ There was so much talk of redemption by
the Jets Sunday that perhaps they should have held the game at a
tent revival, or a self-help seminar. Even Coach Bill Parcells
spoke of a higher power helping guide them to one of the most
exciting, loud and potentially important victories in the Jets' 39
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``God's playing in some of these games, and He was on our side
today,'' said the relieved coach, sounding like a battlefield
commander.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-31 triumph over the Seahawks _ and the game was that
close _ kept the Jets (9-4) tied with the Dolphins for first place
in the American Conference East, and sets up their prime-time
meeting at Miami on Sunday night. If the Jets win their final three
games, they will take the division title for the first time since
the big AFL-NFL merger of 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The winning play was launched on a last-ditch fourth-down 5-yard
quarterback sneak by Vinny Testaverde, himself an improbable hero
whose future began here this season at the age of 34. Testaverde
rode the hole created by Kevin Mawae, the former Seahawks' center,
who had been jittery facing his former teammates. Testaverde
carried to the vicinity of the goal line before he went down with
20 seconds remaining in the game. Did the ball break the plane of
the white line for a touchdown?
</P>
<P>
   Head Linesman Earnie Frantz III, who was facing Testaverde,
immediately signaled touchdown. That set off a display of feverish
activity: Jets' fans began jumping up and down in the stands, the
Seahawks jumped up and down in protest and Jets' players, some of
them having just finished praying on the sidelines, jumped up and
down with glee.
</P>
<P>
   Television viewers were able to see the play _ again and again _
and they know it wasn't a touchdown. No matter, there is no instant
replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called it right away and signaled,'' said referee Phil
Luckett, who also conducted the now-infamous coin toss on
Thanksgiving Day at Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of bobbled it,'' Testaverde said after the game. ``And
I wasn't able to reach out, and the ref called it good. But we had
some calls go against us.''
</P>
<P>
   So, did you think you were in? ``It doesn't matter,'' Testaverde
replied. ``It's what the ref thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there is an element of luck in any of this, Jets' fans
know it all evens out. After all, the last time the Jets had a
record this fine it was 1986, and they remember how injuries and
bad bounces and who-knows-what conspired to end their season in
despair. Only the current regime seems to have been able to shake
the stretch of failure that began 12 years ago. Sunday's victory
guarantees a second straight winning season, and that hasn't
happened for the Jets since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, how many times have the Jets returned from a
fourth-quarter deficit of 12 points? How many times have they won
in December? This was only the Jets' seventh December victory in
the 1990s, against 26 losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' Parcells finally concluded after pondering all the bad
things the Jets had done Sunday, including rookie Jason Fabini's
offside penalty that pushed the Jets back after they had gotten to
the 3, ``I would call it a lot of luck on the Jets' side.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also noted, ``We showed a champ's heart today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets made their share of bad plays. They seemed to have the
Seahawks reeling early as Keith Byars snared a 3-yard pass from
Testaverde to open the scoring. On the next Seattle drive, Jerome
Henderson intercepted the young quarterback Joe Kitna (17 for 24
for 278 yards).
</P>
<P>
   But Henderson tried to do too much with the interception, and
after running it back through traffic he was finally stopped _ and
stripped of the ball. On the next play, Kitna launched a 70-yard
touchdown bomb to Joey Galloway, who got in front of cornerback
Aaron Glenn. On the next drive, Galloway produced a 57-yard score,
also over Glenn, and suddenly the Jets were behind, 14-7.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, the only player on the team who has gone to the Pro Bowl
as a Jet, intercepted a pass meant for Galloway in the second
quarter. But when he came down with the ball, he landed awkwardly
on his right ankle. He was on crutches at game's end, wearing a
soft cast, and the team said he had a sprain.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad day for injuries for the Jets _ who had entered the
game as the least-injured team in the league _ as Byars broke his
arm. The Jets gave no hint of the future availability of Glenn and
Byars.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, Testaverde was intercepted for a touchdown
return by Anthony Simmons, Curtis Martin scored a touchdown for the
Jets on a 1-yard run, and Seattle scored a 50-yard field goal to
take a 31-19 lead into the final period. There was a sense that it
just wasn't going to end well for the Jets. The Jets' defense was
giving up big plays, and the offensive game plan favored
Testaverde's passing to Martin's rushing.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was to tote the ball only 17 times for 37 yards as the
Jets felt they could create passing plays, and used nine receivers.
Testaverde was 42 of 63 for 418 yards, setting a club record for
attempts and tying the team mark for completions.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde threw the ball 18 times in the final 15 minutes. He
helped bring the Jets to 31-26 early in the quarter on a 16-yard
pass to Keyshawn Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Jets' defense stiffened. Galloway was unable to shake
Ray Mickens, who had replaced Glenn. Galloway caught no more passes
after his second score, and Ricky Watters failed to break any more
big runs. Finally, with 3 minutes 15 seconds remaining, Testaverde
took over again.
</P>
<P>
   And at the end, Parcells gave Testaverde the option to decide
the Jets' fate: The quarterback could decide whether to run or to
pass. He was the only person behind the center as five receivers
were spread out. Testaverde told the Jets in the huddle he would
make the call at the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   And what did he see?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of cloudy,'' he said. For this game, though, he
could see forever.

SPORTS COLUMN: NEW BOWL FORMULA LEAVES LITTLE ROOM FOR WHINING
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The system wasn't exactly ``broke,'' as they say in college
football. It was merely subjective and political, driven by money
and personalities, just like the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But what the heck, they tinkered with the system of producing a
national college champion, so we all could sleep soundly and not
have to fret about who was No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   A new-fangled witches' brew of three computer rankings and two
polls of coaches and writers came up with exactly the same game
they would have had under the previous system _ No. 1 Tennessee
against No. 2 Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4, the first
time the championship will be ``official.'' The new formula got a
break Saturday when two undefeated teams, UCLA and Kansas State,
both lost. The system does not have any tolerance for three
undefeated teams, so somebody would have been on the outside,
whining, which is an integral part of college football.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Saturday's mayhem, we now have Tennessee playing
Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl four days into the new year.
Whatever happened to New Year's Day, you ask? New Year's Day
doesn't matter anymore. Might as well go bird-watching or read a
good book. All those football announcers can squeal their favorite
expressions, all the cheerleaders can prance, all the players can
wave to their moms, all the coaches can spout their cliches, none
of it means squat.
</P>
<P>
   The only game in town this year is the Fiesta Bowl, because of
the final rankings of the Bowl Championship Series, announced
Sunday shortly before Vinny Testaverde of the Jets obviously did
not get into the end zone but whatever. I'll miss the potential for
mischief from other major bowls. I don't know about you, but I find
ambiguity to be good entertainment, like listening to a shifty-eyed
witness giving testimony under oath. What do you mean ``national?''
What do you mean ``champion?'' What do you mean ``unofficial?''
</P>
<P>
   Under last year's system, the Fiesta Bowl would have had first
crack at the two best teams, and undoubtedly would have opted for
Tennessee and Florida State. Tennessee earned its spot by going
undefeated and Coach Bobby Bowden of Florida State earned his spot
by rallying his players after an early loss, reminding them that
the entire season is basically a series of bowl games.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State was a victory from unprecedented glory and riches
but lost to Texas A&AMP;M, in double overtime in the Big 12
championship game. Twenty-four hours later, it was not included in
any of the major bowls. Tough. UCLA may have lost its shot at a
national championship because of a real hurricane, Georges, which
forced the postponement of an early game. When the game was finally
played Saturday, the Miami Hurricanes themselves blew UCLA out of
the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Now UCLA gets to play Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl, always a
lovely day in the bosky dell in Pasadena, but now about as
appealing as a spring intrasquad game. Tough.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Rose Bowl was a player because it had not joined
the conglomeration. When Michigan barely held off Washington State,
it left room for Nebraska to impress by stampeding all over
Tennessee the next night in the Orange Bowl. So Michigan and
Nebraska each finished first in one of the polls. So we had two
champions. So what was the harm?
</P>
<P>
   Under last year's setup, the Rose Bowl would be a stinker this
year because Wisconsin is not considered anywhere near as good as
Ohio State, the Big Ten runnerup, now playing Texas A&AMP;M. ''We're
happy to be in the Sugar Bowl, but I think we can make an argument
that we're one of the top two,'' said John Cooper of Ohio State
Sunday. ``We were No. 1 for nine straight weeks. It's difficult to
run the table to go undefeated. The day we got beat, we did not
play our best game. You stub your toe one time you've got to be a
great team to get a chance to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was whining a bit and politicking, but that's what
college football coaches are supposed to do. Under last year's
setup, Cooper could have envisioned a situation this year in which
Florida State barely nipped Tennessee in a Fiesta Bowl stinker
while Ohio State drubbed Texas A&AMP;M to make a case for being No. 1
in somebody's poll. Any poll would do. Let's give thanks for small
favors. If there had been three undefeated teams, right now you
would be hearing a cry for a playoff system, four teams, eight
teams, 16 teams. The season still ends the first week in January.
We don't need a playoff system. Our scholar-athletes all have
finals. Don't they?  &QL;

EXCLUSIVE: U.S. INITIATIVES SEEK TO REDEFINE NATO IN POST-SOVIET
ERA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is urging its European
allies to embark on a new initiative to combat weapons of mass
destruction, as an example of the kinds of new threats a
modernized, post-Soviet NATO must deal with in the next century,
senior American and NATO-country officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Brussels on
Tuesday and Wednesday, called to set the agenda for the 50th
anniversary NATO summit meeting to convene here in April, the
United States will propose a new NATO Center for Weapons of Mass
Destruction, commonly referred to as ``WMD.''
</P>
<P>
   The center would be a clearinghouse for increased
intelligence-sharing by Washington intended to produce a more
unified assessment of the threats posed both by states, like Iran
or Iraq, and ``non-state actors,'' like terrorist groups of the
kind led by Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Washington believes that with access to more sophisticated
intelligence, NATO countries will agree more on the dangers posed
by the post-Cold War world, and be more prepared to collaborate in
policing them.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are also pushing for greater collaboration by the
alliance to deter weapons of mass destruction and to defend allied
populations and territory against them. Proposals include vaccines,
advanced protective outfits for the military, detection equipment
and other cooperative research and development. This would
alleviate the need for each country of the alliance to bear the
cost of covering every contingency on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a microcosm for the new NATO, and for its larger
debates and dilemmas,'' a senior American official said. ``We're
trying to ensure that NATO makes it effectively and relevantly into
the new era.''
</P>
<P>
   But the debate over weapons of mass destruction is also a
microcosm for a more controversial discussion over how far NATO
should move beyond its traditional role _ the collective defense of
its members' territories _ to what Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, in a memorandum to American ambassadors, calls ``the
broader concept of the defense of our common interests,'' both in
Europe and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Questions of NATO's mandate and reach are particularly sensitive
after the Soviet collapse and while Europe pushes for a stronger
political identity, with some muscle to match. Though the United
States and its overwhelmingly superior abilities for military
logistics and intelligence are considered mandatory for collective
NATO action in Europe, as has been seen in Bosnia, some Europeans
also fear being made a junior partner to American strategic
interests elsewhere, like the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   American and British officials insist such fears are overblown,
and they appear to have allayed French and German concerns about a
``globalized NATO.'' The Americans and the British argue that no
one is trying to redefine Article 5 of the NATO charter, which
mandates collective defense against attack, but to examine new ways
that Article 5 could be triggered. While a Russian tank invasion is
no longer likely, a missile attack against Rome with a biological
warhead could qualify as an Article 5 attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some don't like the idea because it might mean NATO using
force to take out weapons or facilities in Iraq,'' said a senior
American official, referring to fears that NATO would make
pre-emptive strikes outside Europe. ``But we're not talking about
that, but lower-key things, like heightening awareness and how NATO
operates if there is an attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's current ``strategic concept,'' which defines its
military and political mission, was last revised in 1991, before
the Soviet Union collapsed, and still speaks of ``strategic balance
in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   All of NATO's 16 members _ soon to be 19 with the addition of
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic _ agree that the concept
needs updating. President Clinton wants to introduce the new
doctrine _ together with a simpler statement of NATO's purpose
designed for voters instead of generals _ at the April summit
meeting at which he will be host.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in the game of strategic balance anymore, but of
collective defense and the extension of security beyond our
borders,'' said a senior diplomat for a NATO country.
</P>
<P>
   That includes NATO's enlargement to the east, its partnerships
with non-members and peacekeeping operations like in Bosnia and
threats of bombing in Kosovo, the diplomat said. But it does not
mean NATO tramping into the Middle East in pursuit of biological
weapons that might someday be used, he said, as the French
originally feared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early American ideas that NATO might globalize itself have
faded,'' the diplomat said. ``We're talking of retaining NATO as an
effective European instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials argue that NATO is, in any event, an alliance
based on consensus. ``If member countries don't want NATO to do
something, then NATO won't do it,'' an official said. Individual
NATO countries are already free to join _ as some did _ ad hoc
alliances such as that massed against Iraq for the Persian Gulf War
in 1991, which operated under a U.N. Security Council mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Even senior French diplomats say they no longer believe that
Washington is pushing NATO to be the instrument of ``a new Holy
Roman Empire,'' as one put it.
</P>
<P>
   The current French concern, as the April summit meeting
approaches, is the so-called ``mandate question,'' a desire to
insure that NATO does not define itself in the new strategic
concept as able to act without reference to the U.N. Security
Council, where five countries, including France, hold veto power.
</P>
<P>
   While the alliance agreed to threaten to bomb Serb positions to
halt the violence in Kosovo, it did so without a Security Council
resolution. The legal basis in international law was ``humanitarian
intervention'' to prevent the deaths of thousands of ethnic
Albanians huddling homeless in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   But while the American envoy Richard Holbrooke called Kosovo a
precedent, German and French officials say it was merely a special
case. The Americans for now are happy to agree and take the
pragmatic, case-by-case approach.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is eager that the mandate debate not limit NATO's
flexibility and render any military action subject to a Chinese or
Russian veto in the Security Council. That would not only be
self-defeating, an administration official said, but would ``drive
Congress around the bend.'' But most European countries, as well as
Canada, prefer NATO to act, when not specifically in self-defense,
under a Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Between now and April, officials say, there will be some
language agreed upon that could refer simply to NATO acting on ``a
firm legal basis,'' or, as likely, there will be no language on the
issue at all.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even the American initiative on weapons of mass destruction is
not without controversy. While few European officials question the
importance of the issue in the next century or object to more
intelligence-sharing from Washington, they do have a set of
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   They do not want this WMD initiative to overshadow the April
summit meeting; they don't want the Americans to act as if European
countries have done nothing to protect themselves and their
population; they don't want the Americans to scare the European
public, and they want NATO initiatives to enhance, not duplicate or
supersede, existing institutions dealing with such weapons.
</P>
<P>
   These institutions, like the International Atomic Energy Agency
or the Nuclear Suppliers Group, concentrate on export controls of
dangerous materials. Most European countries prefer to concentrate
on perfecting and tightening such controls, and not militarizing
the fight against proliferation, a European official said.
</P>
<P>
   That is why recent comments by Defense Secretary William Cohen,
rejecting German and Canadian calls for NATO to rule out the
first-use of nuclear weapons, caused a small tempest. Even with the
Soviet threat gone, he said, such weapons could deter the use of
biological and chemical weapons by those who might attack NATO.
</P>
<P>
   But the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against
non-nuclear states who have signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty would violate that treaty, said Joseph Cirincione of the
Carnegie Endowment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another reason for Europeans to worry about Washington
trying to drag NATO into its disputes in North Africa or the Middle
East,'' Cirincione said. ``After all, where would these weapons be
used? It's very difficult to identify a use of nuclear weapons
today in the defense of NATO itself.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In the dejected Seattle Seahawks' locker
room Sunday, the emotions ranged from frustration to bewilderment
to outrage.
</P>
<P>
   How else could the Seahawks react to their controversial 32-31
loss to the Jets? Television replays indicated that Vinny
Testaverde was tackled before the ball crossed the goal line on his
game-winning, 5-yard quarterback sneak with 20 seconds left in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   If the play had been called that way, the Seahawks would have
stopped the Jets on the fourth-down play, and Seattle could have
simply run out the clock and left Giants Stadium with a hard-earned
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Seahawks (6-7) were dealt a crushing defeat that
seriously damaged their playoff hopes. Making matters worse, they
saw a strong offensive performance go to waste.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle led by 28-13 early in the third quarter, after Anthony
Simmons intercepted a Testaverde pass and returned it 36 yards for
a touchdown. At that point, the Jets were in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Galloway, Seattle's fleet wide receiver, had already burned
the Jets for touchdown catches of 70 yards and 57 yards. Aaron
Glenn, the Jets' best coverage cornerback, had been beaten
one-on-one by Galloway on both touchdowns. And Glenn was forced to
leave the game late in the second quarter with a sprained ankle,
leaving the Jets' defense even more shorthanded for the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Seattle was held to just one field goal during the game's
final 28 minutes. Ray Mickens did a solid job replacing Glenn, and
the Jets gave Mickens help by double-teaming Galloway, who did not
catch a pass in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks blamed themselves for not throwing to Galloway more
often, and for not taking advantage of other openings presented by
the Jets' second-half decision to double-team Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They double-teamed me, but it's the same coverage we've been
seeing around here for 13 weeks,'' Galloway said of New York's
second-half defense. ``We either figure it out it and beat it, or
we don't, and I don't get the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Erickson, Seattle's coach, admitted his team should have
kept throwing to Galloway. ``We have to get the ball to him
regardless of what they're doing,'' Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway welcomed the one-on-one matchup against the Jets' best
cornerback, and he was sorry to see Glenn leave the game. Glenn was
injured when he landed awkwardly after intercepting another deep
pass intended for Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   But Jon Kitna, Seattle's quarterback, said a bad throw led to
Glenn's interception. ``I threw it too far to the right,'' said
Kitna. ``If I throw it to the left, we've got another touchdown.
Joey had him beat dead to rights. We just didn't make the proper
throw. And when we got ahead, we didn't put them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his matchup against Glenn, Galloway said, ``I hadn't
seen bump-and-run coverage in a while. When I saw him go down, I
knew it was going to be double-coverage from here on out. From my
standpoint, I was hoping that he played.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Mickens, Galloway said: ``He didn't do much. He
played soft coverage, didn't come up, pretty much what we expected.
When you go deep against their best guy twice and beat him, you
don't expect that second guy to tangle with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite Galloway's confidence and two touchdowns, the game
was won by the Jets. The Seahawks had been beaten. But in their
hearts, they believed they had been robbed.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, they were not interested in apologies, sympathy or
admissions of error. They wanted a victory. And in their opinion,
one had been stolen from them because of incompetent officiating.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought of the officiating crew, Seattle defensive
end Michael Sinclair did not mince words. ``They need to go see the
wizard _ no heart, no courage,'' Sinclair said. ``It's
frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle cornerback Shawn Springs threw his helmet in disgust
more than 10 yards after Testaverde's last run was ruled a
touchdown. ``To us, that was a playoff game,'' he said later.
``We're fighting for our lives. Now, if we're not dead, we're in
critical condition.''

PC GAMES SCORING AS WORKPLACE TOOLS  &HT;     BY DAN FOST 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - GAMES   &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer games are not just for teenage boys with baggy pants.
</P>
<P>
   Frito-Lay truck drivers, New York bankers and oil refinery
workers are playing computer games _ as the latest form of
corporate in-house training.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the corporate games are even built on the same software
that powers popular computer games like Quake and Unreal _
high-speed action games that involve killing hideous aliens.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people go home and turn on Nintendo 64 for fun, there must
be something compelling,'' said Pjotr van Schothorst, who develops
new ways of training employees at Royal Dutch Shell in Holland.
``We want to see: Can we tap into those concepts?''
</P>
<P>
   The company is working on game-like environments for a host of
purposes, including training workers who are headed for oil
platforms, or familiarizing employees with the complex underground
locales of oil reservoirs. Ultimately, Van Schothorst envisions
making the games available to the public as a recruitment tool _
``to show that working for an oil company can be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Shell has hired some of the same star gamemakers from the world
of PC action to make its in-house products. Noah Falstein of
Greenbrae, a former game producer from LucasArts Entertainment Co.,
traveled to Holland earlier this year and is working on prototypes
for Shell.
</P>
<P>
   Falstein once made games based on ``Star Wars'' and ``Indiana
Jones'' movies and has seen the game industry evolve into a
Hollywood business model, in which games cost so much to produce
that companies feel pressure to score a big hit.
</P>
<P>
   While the corporate work does not carry those burdens _ it
doesn't need to be a hit with anyone other than the client _ it
does present designers with other challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The negative side,'' Falstein said, ``is that people within
the corporate chain have distinct ideas about what's necessary.
They might have a whole set of legal requirements that are
important but quite boring.''
</P>
<P>
   It's precisely the stultifying nature of much corporate learning
that has made using games so appealing.
</P>
<P>
   So much of what businesses force-feed their employees is boring
lectures, fat binders and PowerPoint presentations _ yet the
content often is critical information about how the company works,
what's expected in the employees' jobs, or what policies the
employees need to follow. Conversely, said Marc Prensky, a vice
president at Bankers Trust in New York and the founder of its
subsidiary Corporate Gameware, ``Games have an incredible amount of
engagement but no business content.''
</P>
<P>
   The first game Prensky made, before he arrived at Bankers Trust,
was &UR;  &LR; for airlines. He called it Where in the World Is Carmen
Sandiego's Luggage?
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he's developed several games at Bankers Trust, both
for the company's internal use and to sell to other firms,
including CadLab and Reuters. In Straight Shooter, which could be
used in any type of organization, players comb the Earth looking
for potential clients. ``Along the way, you have to overcome
problems like monsters _ you shoot them with ideas from your cell
phone,'' Prensky said. ``The client tells you, `If you get this
question right, I'll be your client.'''
</P>
<P>
   With that game, any type of questions can be inserted, making it
a fun way to brief employees on ethics, sexual harassment policies,
or even product information. If employees get a low score, the
cartoon client tells them, ``Go back to b-school. Call me when
you're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   In another game, The Monkey Wrench Conspiracy, players are
intergalactic agents trying to save the universe _ by learning
tasks that relate to their company's business. ``There are puzzles
to solve and things to jump over and muck not to get caught in,''
Prensky said. ``We've taken the genre of the commercial game and
combined it with real deep business knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Prensky hopes his games help companies reach their newest
employees, members of the ``Nintendo generation.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where games like Quake and Unreal come in. While Id
Software, the Texas maker of Quake, lets people use its engine free
of charge, Epic Mindgames, the Canadian firm that makes the popular
alien-shooter game Unreal, licenses its software.
</P>
<P>
   One Canadian company used the Unreal engine to train employees
at an occupational health and safety company by ``creating a
building with a bunch of occupational health and safety hazards,''
said Mark Rein, vice president of Epic. ``We're very interested if
people want to use the engine to do these kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   For more-traditional workers who don't want an Unreal-style
twitch game, producers like Prensky build games in such a way that
players can opt for a more standard quiz format. After all, workers
who came of age before the computer game craze prefer their own
generation's games, such as Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Those games, with content tailored to individual companies'
needs, have proven to be popular with many companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the mandatory six-month training program that all Ford Motor
Co. sales and marketing workers take, ``at the end of each week, on
Friday afternoons, people were fading off on us,'' said Paul
Ventimiglia, developer of computer-based training at the Detroit
automaker. ``Now, we play Jeopardy every Friday. When they know the
game is coming up and there's a contest, they say, `We've got to
know this. Our team is at stake.' They pay attention to things more
and enjoy it more obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   To spice up a training CD-ROM for restaurant workers, 3DJoe, a
firm in San Francisco's Multimedia Gulch, created a
three-dimensional digital character, Buddy, with an absurdly huge
smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to talk the language of your audience,'' said Hugo
Campos, art director at 3DJoe.
</P>
<P>
   In his work for San Francisco's Bechtel Corp., making CDs used
in bidding for expensive construction projects, Campos plays it
straight. The buttoned-down company doesn't want to let frivolity
slip into its presentations.
</P>
<P>
   But in the restaurant CD, Check Please, users can click on a
screen showing a kitchen or restaurant scene, and Buddy emerges to
explain that facet of the business _ how to sell extra desserts,
for instance, or how to pronounce different wines' names.
</P>
<P>
   The 3DJoe programmers also inserted a couple of ``Easter eggs,''
or hidden actions in which Buddy is found sloshed behind the bar or
yelling into a cell phone, griping to his agent, ``I can't work
with these people!''
</P>
<P>
   The Easter eggs became a selling point for the CD, Campos said.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations' interest in livening up their training has created
business opportunities for high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   Macromedia of San Francisco takes products it originally made
for game and Web site design and sells them to large corporations
for in-house training.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, QVC and Frito-Lay are among the customers of Macromedia's
Learning Division. QVC trains tour guides of its West Chester,
Penn., headquarters, as well as the salespeople at various
facilities who take calls from television shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Frito-Lay trained more than 1,200 truckers about drug and
alcohol abuse by hiring BusinessWorks, a Texas firm, to create a
CD-ROM truck stop. At Rosie's Place, truckers can click on
``scrambled regs,'' or regulations, or ``sloppy joes,'' meaning
those messy drugs.
</P>
<P>
   An actress plays Rosie, a waitress who guides users through the
program. ``She's got this cute little accent and serves up this
good serving of information,'' said Bob Kaiser, president of
BusinessWorks.
</P>
<P>
   Truckers can stop in at training centers around the country to
take the training, even if they only want to spend a few minutes at
a time. ``They're getting used to the computer,'' said Larry
Merrifield, field fleet safety manager at Frito-Lay. ``They were
afraid of it at first, but they prefer it to us calling a meeting
on Saturday or Sunday, a four-hour session on drug and alcohol
training.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more cerebral computer games was SimCity, the game in
which players build simulated cities and then deal with taxes,
crime, floods and fire. The game, made by Maxis, a Walnut Creek
company that is now a division of Electronic Arts, had an early
corporate adopter in Chevron, which commissioned a game called
SimRefinery.
</P>
<P>
   Although that game never took off, the division of Maxis that
made corporate games developed into such a viable business that it
spun off as a separate company, Thinking Tools in Monterey.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking Tools now makes such products as TeleSim, a game that
simulates the telecommunications industry that's been used by at
least one Canadian phone company. &UR;  &LR; ``It puts you in the role of
decision-maker at a telephone company,'' said Thinking Tools
founder John Hiles.
</P>
<P>
   When the user makes a business move, the computer has a
competing telecom firm ``trying to eat your lunch and responding to
your moves,'' Hiles said.
</P>
<P>
   Hiles said he sees so many business people frittering away time
on airplanes playing solitaire on their laptops. ``They can be just
as glued to a simulation game,'' he said, ``and they'll be just as
excited because it will be relevant to them and their business.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
NEW ORLEANS _ The Cowboys moved the ball exactly zero yards to put
their first _ and only _ points on the board Sunday. It would prove
to be their most productive possession.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what Cowboys players would label the worst performance of
their careers, they allowed the New Orleans Saints to manhandle
them 22-3 at the Superdome.
</P>
<P>
   With Arizona losing to the Giants later in the day, the Cowboys
(8-5) would have clinched the NFC East title had they won Sunday.
But while the defeat did nothing to set Dallas back in the
standings, it was a huge blow to some Pro Bowl egos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you want to put this out of your mind?'' receiver
Michael Irvin said. ``Why would you want to put it out of your
body? You've got to remember this feeling so you can say, `I'm not
going to let this happen again.' And that 24-hour rule (before you
forget this game and begin thinking about the next), I don't buy
into that, either.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Cowboys' offense managed 36 points in a Thanksgiving
Day loss to Minnesota, being kept of the end zone was unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we, 8-5? I guess the worst we can finish now is
8-8,'' Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith said. ``I've been here
nine years. I haven't seen anything like this before in my life.
What we've done in the past is history. What we are going to do in
the future remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith had reason to be frustrated: His 15 carries netted six
yards. Throw in Sherman Williams' two yards, and the Cowboys
totaled eight yards on the ground (on 18 carries), a franchise
standard for futility. The previous low was 20, against the Saints
in 1989 and the Giants in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``They caused a lot of confusion,'' said Smith, whose average of
0.4 yards per carry was a career worst. ``If ever there was a
complete shutdown, today was a complete shutdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a 16-for-32 passing performance by Troy Aikman, the
Cowboys managed 182 total yards, their worst output this season. It
was the first time this year their offense didn't score a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the best defensive game I've seen in a long time,''
said Saints coach Mike Ditka, who used continuous blitzing to
pressure the Cowboys' line. ``You've got to take me back to the
'50s or the '80s. This is the best I've seen. And you've got to
realize that offenses are much more sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was an indication of things to come, it came when
Smith was knocked back four yards to open the game. Aikman was then
chased into the end zone and made a desperate attempt to get rid of
the ball. He was called for intentional grounding, giving the
Saints a safety.
</P>
<P>
   And it only got worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the dog beat out of us,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey
said. ``We've got a lot of work to do to get ourselves back to
where we think we've got a chance to compete in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had six first-half possessions. They moved the ball
25 yards on one, 33 on another. The other four covered minus-four,
minus-three, zero and minus-one yards. They had another drive of
minus-15 yards in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Cowboys finally managed to move from one end of the
field to the other on their final possession, it looked like a
comedy of errors. Thanks to Saints miscues that included penalties
for having 12 men on the field and pass interference, the Cowboys
got 10 shots at the end zone from inside the New Orleans 10. Aikman
threw six incomplete passes, Smith was hammered for a loss of three
yards on one carry, and the other attempts simply came up short.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you saw, we stunk out there today,'' Smith said. ``We
didn't do anything. We have nothing to be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys actually held a brief 3-2 lead, but if there were
such a stat, the field goal would have gone down as unearned. Kevin
Mathis made one of the Cowboys' only big plays of the day,
intercepting a pass from Kerry Collins that was intended for Sean
Dawkins.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys got possession at the New Orleans 16, and Aikman
threw three straight incompletions. Richie Cunningham then booted a
33-yard field goal for Dallas' only points of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a good job of blitzing us, and we didn't make
adjustments fast enough,'' Gailey said. ``We thought we had it
worked out. We did not have it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense was expected to be Dallas' weaker side after a slew
of injuries to the secondary, but it actually looked like the
Cowboys' strength. It forced the Saints to turn the ball over on
downs on their first possession, then added the interception in the
first quarter. And Dallas twice held the Saints to long field goals
and once forced a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Saints' 328 total yards came on an 89-yard scoring
strike from Kerry Collins to Andre Hastings, who outraced Mathis to
the end zone late in the first half. Their only other touchdown
also came in the second quarter at the end of a seven-minute,
80-yard drive. Collins hit Aaron Craver with a four-yarder for the
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have got to be questions,'' Cowboys linebacker Randall
Godfrey said. ``Sometimes, you see Dallas as dominating. Sometimes,
this is the team. We show up like we're going to play. Then we show
up, and things like today happen.''

E-COMPARE'S GRAND PLAN _ FREE STOCK  &HT;     BY JON SWARTZ
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - NET FILES   &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Nothing in life is free _ especially Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   So why is E-Compare Corp., an online shopping service, giving
away shares for free?
</P>
<P>
   The privately held Mountain View startup hopes that distributing
free shares will create a valuable Internet commodity: traffic on
its Web site. More eyeballs translate into sweeter advertising
deals and more revenue. ``We want to draw people into our service;
once we do, we're convinced they'll come back for more,'' said
President Steve Grand.
</P>
<P>
   E-Compare _ which provides price listings for books, and plans
to add CD titles next month _ is offering up to 10 shares of stock
for anyone who registers at  &LR; www.ecompare.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Grand, a 37-year-old high-tech consultant, said he plans to
eventually take the company public. Of E-Compare's 54 million
shares outstanding, the Web-surfing public will own 19 million and
the rest will remain with the company.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,300 people have scooped up shares since E-Compare began
advertising on its Web site last month, Grand said.
</P>
<P>
   Some might suggest that the offer sounds like a scene straight
out of the Mel Brooks comedy, ``The Producers,'' in which a
hard-luck Broadway producer and a meek accountant oversell stock in
a play they hope will flop, so they can pocket the money and run.
</P>
<P>
   But an SEC spokesman said last week that such bargains don't
violate securities laws ``as long as there is no compensation or
strings attached.''
</P>
<P>
   E-Compare is following in the footsteps of Travelzoo.com
( &LR; www.travelzoo.com) &LR; , a Bahamas budget travel company with 700,000
``owners'' _ each of whom picked up free shares by simply showing
up at the company's Web site. Travelzoo.com held its first company
meeting online last month to elect board members who will not be
paid but have voting authority.
</P>
<P>
   E-Compare's announcement ``validates what we are doing. There
was a lot of skepticism about us; it is good to see that others are
following,'' said Travelzoo.com CEO Ralph Bartel, 32, who lives in
Aalen, Germany. ``If 1998 was the year of paying lots of money for
Internet shares, maybe 1999 will be the year of getting free
Internet stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartel said his company will go public only when it is
consistently profitable. ``There is no concrete plan at this
time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, E-Compare occupies the same office space in Mountain
View as Travelzoo.com. There is no affiliation between the
companies, according to Bartel and Grand.
</P>

THE WILD, WILD WEST &QL; 
My condolences to customers of Atbigger.net, the all-you-can-eat
Internet service provider that charged $60 for unlimited, lifetime
online access but petered out in October with money problems and
was bought by another financially challenged ISP, Brigadoon.com.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, flustered Atbigger.net customers have inundated my
voice- and e-mail with complaints about shoddy service from
Brigadoon.com _ if any service at all. ``The service seems to have
stopped altogether,'' said Harold Novikoff of Millbrae. Len Shaffer
of Emeryville hasn't had service since mid-November; he's
considering a switch to Pacific Bell Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It's just the lastest in a string of travails for
Atbigger.net's beleaguered customers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a vow last month to post online information for
Atbigger.net's 40,000 stranded subscribers, Brigadoon.com has yet
to notify anyone via e-mail, its Web site, telephone or letters.
Most troubling, Brigadoon.com wasn't even answering its phones at
one point last week. ``It's been nothing but busy signals for
days,'' said Kate Adams of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But help may be on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Brigadoon.com CEO John Hansen said the Bellevue,
Wash., company was in the process of transferring Atbigger.net
customers to its national Internet service over the weekend. He
suggests that Atbigger.net members call (206) 652-9365, Ext. 0;
e-mail  &LR; wmparker &LR; brigadoon.com &LR;  or  &LR; admin &LR; brigadoon.com &LR; ; and check
out  &LR; www.brigadoon.com  &LR; for more information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend on honoring our commitment,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of Atbigger.net's customers felt that they got
their money's worth from the thrifty service, investors and
creditors aren't likely to see any of the money they sank into
Atbigger.net.
</P>
<P>
   But is this a surprise _ considering that a pair of former
Atbigger.net officials allegedly once rushed to a South Bay bar to
corner another executive to ``kick his ass''? (The ``targeted''
executive said an icy encounter did take place in a restaurant but
that there was no violence.) &UR;  &LR; Or that faulty equipment from a
prominent Bay Area networking company was at the root of
Atbigger.net's technical glitches? Or even that the company had not
filed federal income taxes in 1996 and 1997? (The IRS is scheduled
to meet with the company's co-founders later this week to hash out
$400,000 in back payments, sources said.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, former executives have engaged in finger pointing,
accusing one another of corporate bungling and malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
   All intriguing rumors, but of little solace to Atbigger.net
subscribers.

iCATCHING SALES: &QL; 
Apple Computer's stylish Internet box, the iMac, is the Energizer
Bunny of low-end computers. It keeps selling and selling and
selling ...
</P>
<P>
   For three-straight months, it has been the top-selling product
in computer superstores, according to ZD Market Intelligence in La
Jolla (San Diego County). In October, the iMac accounted for 4.7
percent of total PC shipments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the Apple faithful have never been able to buy a Mac
for less than $1,500 _ until now,'' said analyst Matt Sargent.
``This is a consumer product with staying power.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; And sales could pick up significantly if rumors of an iMac
price cut and introduction of a high-end model are correct.
</P>
<P>
   The scuttlebutt is that Apple will shave the $1,299
beach-ball-shaped computer's price to $999 early next year to
compete with sub-$1,000 PCs. What's more, a second iMac model _
with a faster processor and more disk space _ could debut in 1999
for $1,299, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.
</P>

SITES OF THE WEEK &QL; 
Just 17 more shopping days until Christmas, and millions of
Americans already are surfing the Web instead of crawling the

<P>
   Sure, there are the usual online stops for tried-and-true
holiday gifts: Amazom.com ( &LR; www.amazon.com) &LR; , eToys

</P>
<P>
   But to show you really care, why not exhibit some ingenuity and
explore some back roads on the information superhighway for your
gift list?

 &HT;    Bulldogs picked for Peach Bowl, passed over by Outback
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia's holiday plans went from the Outback to
the Bulldogs' own back yard on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the No. 19 Dogs were snubbed by Tampa's Outback
Bowl, which chose unranked Kentucky to play No. 20 Penn State on
New Year's Day. The Wildcats lost to Georgia 28-26 in Lexington on
Oct. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs, coming off a 21-19 loss to Georgia Tech in the
regular-season finale, settled for an invitation to the Chick-fil-A
Peach Bowl. The Dogs will face No. 12 Virginia in the Georgia Dome
on New Year's Eve in a game that will be nationally televised by
ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first matchup of top-20 teams for the Peach Bowl,
which will have a payout of more than $1.5 million to each
participating school this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really don't have anything to say about anyone else's
selection,'' Georgia coach Jim Donnan said. ''Our loss to Georgia
Tech was really disappointing, but then again we had one of the
best records in the SEC. I'm very glad the Peach Bowl selected us.
It looks like they've got two better ranked teams than the
Outback.''
</P>
<P>
   After losing to the Yellow Jackets for the first time since
1990, Georgia officials still seemed relatively confident that the
Dogs would return to Tampa, where they blasted Wisconsin 33-6 in
last year's Outback Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   However, Outback officials instead chose the Wildcats, who
finished 7-4, including a 4-4 record in the SEC, which put them two
games behind Georgia in the Eastern Division.
</P>
<P>
   Outback Bowl Chairman Jim McVay said the bowl's selection
committee was attracted to Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch, a
Heisman Trophy finalist, who's expected to enter the NFL draft
after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the names that kept coming up on the SEC side as we
evaluated was Tim Couch,'' McVay said. ''We said, 'We better grab
this guy, bring him in, match him up against a real strong Penn
State team.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The selection committe also was lobbied by Outback Steakhouse
co-founder Chris Sullivan, a University of Kentucky graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been a good alum and doing what you would expect him to
do,'' Outback Bowl spokesman Mike Schultze said earlier this week.
''He's lobbying for his team. At the same time, we have to be
objective and look at all the teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The Peach Bowl also looked at other teams, so it could have been
much worse for the Bulldogs. Peach Bowl Chairman Bob Coggin said
his committee also considered Alabama, which will play Virginia
Tech in Nashville's Music City Bowl. Throughout the week, some
Georgia officials feared the Bulldogs would fall as far as the
Independence, which chose Mississippi and Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel blessed and, frankly, amazed that a Georgia team at
8-3 was available,'' Peach Bowl president Gary Stoken said.
</P>
<P>
   Stoken said 61,000 tickets already have been sold for the game,
which is a rematch of the 1995 Peach Bowl, when the Cavaliers
stunned the Dogs 34-27 on Demetrius Allen's 83-yard kickoff return
for a touchdown with only 57 seconds remaining. That heart-breaker
was Ray Goff's final game as Georgia's coach.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia already has sold 18,000 tickets this year. Georgia sold
25,000 tickets to the game in 1995, and Bulldogs athletics director
Vince Dooley seemed confident that the school would match that this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel really confident that Georgia will sell this game out
for us,'' Stoken said. ''We think it's going to be a real tough
ticket in this city. We think we'll have a sellout in a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan said his team will begin light running today. Workouts
will begin on Wednesday, but the Bulldogs won't practice next week
during final exams. Full-contact practices will start on Dec. 20,
then the team will break for Christmas before meeting in Atlanta on
Dec. 26.

 &HT;    Falcons play to control winning fate
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If it wasn't obvious before, it should be crystal
clear now that this is a very special season for the Atlanta
Falcons. If they can beat the Indianapolis Colts, while
sleep-walking no less, something special is going on.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta won 28-21 Sunday in the Georgia Dome behind quarterback
Chris Chandler, who passed for 297 yards, two touchdowns, and ran
for a score and Jamal Anderson, who rushed for a game-high 122
yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, who have secured a playoff berth, maintained their
one-game lead over the San Francisco 49ers atop the NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   All that might seem typical for a team that is 11-2, with more
victories than all but one of 32 previous Falcons teams.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday was not typical.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has never before beaten the Colts, who showed up Sunday
with a 10-0 record against the Falcons. So it looked like the old
ghost had risen from the grave again after Indianapolis took a 21-7
lead on Marshall Faulk's 3-yard touchdown run with 5:10 left in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, after the Falcons surrendered their first rushing
touchdown in 25 quarters, even-mannered strong safety William White
blew his stack on the sideline. If they were looking closely, many
of the 61,141 fans could see the veins bulging from his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Teammates) were telling me later I lost my religion. I just
wanted to let the guys understand that we're 10-2, not 2-10,''
White said. ``We're playing for something. We can get a (playoff)
bye; we can get homefield and everything if we just keep winning.
That's the way you've got to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I said everything right, no curse words. But my wife
(Nikol) was in the second row. She told me I have to pray extra and
ask for forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons also relied on a little 1998 season history. It was
the third straight game the Falcons have trailed early in the game
against inferior opponents. Two weeks ago, the Bears led 13-3 in
the third quarter. Last week, the Rams were ahead 7-3 in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the comeback began earlier, with Atlanta scoring two
touchdowns in the final 1:21 of the first half to forge a 21-21
tie. The Falcons then scored early in the third quarter, after a
Ray Buchanan interception, to seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The offense and defense both helped dig a hole for the Falcons
early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end O.J. Santiago fumbled on the third play of the game,
giving Indianapolis the ball on the Atlanta 26. Three plays later,
Faulk scored on an 11-yard pass from rookie quarterback Peyton
Manning (19-of-27, 159 yards, two touchdowns, two interceptions).
</P>
<P>
   The Colts drove 58 yards on five plays on the next possession
with Manning hitting wide receiver Torrance Small with a 30-yard
touchdown pass. With 5:36 left in the first quarter, Atlanta was
behind 14-0 and confused by the Colts' two- and three-tight end
sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared to death of Indianapolis . . . because they
really do have an explosive offensive team,'' Falcons coach Dan
Reeves said after his team won for the 17th time in 21 games.
``They do some things a lot different offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons pulled to within 14-7 a few minutes later on a
40-yard flea flicker pass from Chandler to wide receiver Tony
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until Faulk's short scoring run that the Falcons
defense had success by inserting a fourth linebacker, Craig Sauer,
when the Colts went with three tight ends.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis scored touchdowns on three of their first four
possessions, churning out 131 yards of offense. The Colts managed
just 113 yards after that.
</P>
<P>
   After Anderson's 1-yard touchdown run cut the lead to 21-14, the
Falcons stopped the Colts on three plays. A 16-yard punt return by
Tim Dwight gave the Falcons the ball at their 34 with 35 seconds
left. Atlanta used two pass plays and a facemask penalty to drive
to the 3.
</P>
<P>
   After an incomplete pass, Reeves sent the field goal unit out
with five seconds left in the half. The crowd booed. And Reeves
decided to try one more play before kicking a field goal. When
Chandler could not find an open receiver, he ran for the score on
the final play of the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the last second, they jumped outside and doubled Tony,'' he
said. ``I looked (inside) for O.J., but I found a big hole and ran
in. Maybe we just haven't found a way to really get up for teams
like the Bears and the Colts. It must be something mental.''
</P>
<P>
   A mental mistake by Manning that opened the door for the
Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play of the second half, he tried to force a ball
over the middle to Small, thinking free safety Eugene Robinson was
in single coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But cornerback Buchanan, a former Colts player, jumped in front
of both players to get his sixth interception of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peyton looks right at his receivers,'' Robinson said. ``When
he learns to look them off, he's going to be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan returned it 18 yards to the Colts' 14. Three plays
later, Chandler rolled out to the right, and hit Mathis for a
4-yard touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-21 lead held up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We control our own destiny,'' White said. ``We need to start
playing like we belong . . . no matter if it's the 49ers or the
Sisters of the Poor.''

WIRED'S COVER STORY ON MICROSOFT AN UNINTENTIONAL PR BONANZA  &HT;     BY TOM ABATE
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - DIGITAL BAY   &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The cover story in December's Wired magazine really pushed my
antitrust button.
</P>
<P>
   Overlaid on a larger-than-life photo of Bill Gates was the
headline: 83 reasons why his reign over the computer industry is
over. What a revelation! The last thing I'd heard was Microsoft
snickering as Netscape sought asylum with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, I had to read on.
</P>
<P>
   Inside was a succession of bullet points explaining why
Microsoft is losing its stranglehold on computing.
</P>
<P>
   Reason No.1 set the tone for the blithe utterances that
followed. ``Funky Karma'' would come back to haunt Microsoft.
Reason No.7: its ``Divorce'` with Intel would leave Redmond in a
lurch.
</P>
<P>
   And so they went, a stream of two- or three-sentence sound
bites &UR; .  &LR; No.33 nearly sent me over the edge of the BART platform
where I stood reading. Microsoft's earnings, which have risen an
average of 43 percent a year since 1993, could slow to a 23 percent
per annum rise going forward. A mere 23 percent earnings growth
hardly made life seem worth living!
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Even Wired called its article ``a supreme act of
imagination.'' Now I have nothing against good fiction, but I am
lathered over the lousy timing of this suggestion that we trust the
invisible hand of laissez-faire capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In every industry, on every continent, mergers ars busting
records. Oil companies, car companies, phone companies, drug
companies, everywhere _ the huge are getting huger.
</P>
<P>
   And in the midst of this orgy of corporate copulation, our
antitrust regulators finally have got their feeble statutes around
the wrists of one titan and hauled its videotaped essence into
court to answer charges of unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way to overstate the historic significance of the
Microsoft antitrust case. At a time when corporations are
redefining competition as a series of global Sumo matches, the
federal government is trying to impose a few simple rules, like no
grabbing below the belt.
</P>
<P>
   And brash, bad Microsoft is so worried _ you can practically see
the sweat beading up on the mighty brow of Redmond _ that it's
touting any sign of competition as reason for the trust-busters to
back off.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of this lands Wired's 83 reasons, which read like
the thoughts of Chairman Mao meets Fortune magazine. The result is
an unintentional PR bonanza for Microsoft, which is frantically
trying to conjure up the impression that it's not such a juggernaut
after all.
</P>
<P>
   I ran these ruminations past Wired Editor in Chief Katrina Heron
who said I, like most of the media, have fixed on the antitrust
trial as if it were a stake poised above Microsoft's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saying something seismic is going on. It's a sea change;
the trial is just a part of it. Add up all the reasons we give and
look at &QL; 
the big picture,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She did settle one mystery. Why 83 reasons and not 50 or 100?
``We felt Microsoft was such a big company, it deserved a prime
number,'' she said. Personally, I would've settled for three good
reasons _ if Wired had articulated them.
</P>
<P>
   Look, I'm sure there are people who believe that new market
forces, notably the Internet, are changing the business climate in
which Microsoft rose to hegemony. And like the comet that once
humbled the dinosaurs, these market forces could lay the groundwork
for Gates' fall.
</P>
<P>
   I just don't happen to hold the opinion that we should quit
worrying while everything irons itself out. Sure, the Internet is
reshaping the computer landscape, And though it lacks the sudden &LR; 
impact of a comet, it is  &LR; creating new pathways of commerce,
information and power.
</P>
<P>
   But the Net hasn't changed human nature or the temptation to be
a market bully _ or the need to arm commercial cops with more
firepower than ``funky karma.''

MORE FOREIGN STUDENTS ATTENDING U.S. COLLEGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The number of foreign students attending U.S. colleges and
universities is on the rise after four years of stagnation,
according to a study released Monday by the Institute for
International Education.
</P>
<P>
   The study, ``Open Doors, 1997-98,'' reports an increase of 5.1
percent for the 1997-98 school year, with a total of 481,280
foreign students now studying in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The study comes on the heels of a report issued in September
indicating that although U.S. colleges and universities remain the
world leader in attracting foreign students, the United States is
losing its dominance in international education.
</P>
<P>
   That report, issued by the U.S. Information Agency and the
Educational Testing Service, showed that five years ago about 40
percent of all international students studied in the United States,
whereas in 1996-97 the figure was 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The education institute's study used 1997-98 figures, which were
not available for inclusion in the September report.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a year when we thought there would be no increase, it's
genuinely surprising,'' said Allan Goodman, president of the
institute, an educational exchange organization. He pointed to
several possible reasons for the increase, including energetic
overseas recruitment by U.S. universities and the appeal of the
lower cost of two-year community colleges because of the Asian
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The institute found that foreign enrollment in two-year colleges
had jumped 20 percent in the last five years, far outpacing growth
in other types of institutions of higher education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that foreign people learn about the American
educational system is that it's expensive,'' Goodman said. ``And
now they've discovered that our community colleges are a bargain,
costing only one-half to one-tenth as much as the four-year
institutions. Foreign students realize they can use those first two
years to learn the language and get acclimated to living in the
United States, and then they can transfer to a four-year
institution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Another possible reason for the growth this year,'' he said,
``is that Asian students are delaying returning home because there
aren't jobs back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fluctuations in the number of foreign students attending
colleges in this country are watched carefully by education
administrators because many of these students do not seek financial
aid and therefore constitute an important source of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Craven, deputy director for academic programs at the
U.S. Information Agency, who took part in the study that led to the
September report, called the new findings encouraging. But she
added, ``Based on just one year you can't say if it's a trend.''

It's the final leg of the women's marathon race at the 2000
Olympics, and a handful of runners strain toward the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   A cybersurfer clicks on the visage of the Italian athlete to
monitor her heartbeat, then the image of an Ethiopian competitor
for the status of an ailing knee. The surfer checks a splashy
infographic on the bottom of his computer screen for track
conditions and that stiff northernly breeze blowing into the faces
of the runners.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, live video images of the race's conclusion
flicker across a large monitor or Internet-based television screen.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't your father's television coverage of the Summer
Games.
</P>
<P>
   This is the future of international sports coverage, according
to Quokka Sports Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco startup wants to give sports viewing a
decidedly 21st century look, and industry insiders think it will.
Many are calling Quokka the next Big Thing on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-year-old company's coverage this year of two
around-the-world sailing competitions has drawn rave reviews, large
online audiences and even generated a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Quokka has developed sophisticated technology that delivers
cereal spoon-dropping visual content over high-speed Internet
connections to consumers. Some even are calling it ``The Wide World
of Sports'' of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   If Quokka makes good on its grandiose plan, anyone with a
personal computer, set-top TV device, pager or Internet appliance
will soon be able to view through Quokka's Web sites a panorama of
camera angles, sounds, splashy graphics and statistics of
international sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   And Quokka wants to take the concept even further: It plans to
post the vital signs _ possibly in real time _ of participating
athletes, right down to heart rates and blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has the opportunity to be a giant in digital sports
entertainment,'' said Barry Weinman, a Quokka board member and
partner at Media Technology Ventures in Los Altos. ``Sports viewing
will be more than sitting on a couch and cracking open a
six-pack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They could change the way we look at sports,'' said Ann
Kirschner, vice president of NFL Interactive in New York. ``I'd
love to see an Internet-age Olympics, where I get a personalized
view of all the Olympics events. That's a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Heady stuff for a company whose headquarters _ a microchip's
throw from Multimedia Gulch _ is bursting at the seams with 120
employees. Quokka CEO Alan Ramadan says Quokka plans a move into a
larger facility next year, where it hopes to create the first
digital media studio in the city. There, satellite transmitters and
networking links will send and receive sports reports globally.
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan grasped the possibilities of ``digital sports
entertainment'' while chief technology officer on oneAustralia in
the America's Cup sailing race in 1995. Trailing the sailing vessel
in another boat, he was fixated as the event unfolded on a computer
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was far superior to TV coverage,'' Ramadan said. ``With
computerized data, we were able to trace the slightest wind changes
and determine the leader of a race to the second. I thought, `Why
not make this available to everyone?'''
</P>
<P>
   He co-founded Quokka in 1996 with John Bertrand _ a national
sports hero in Australia for wresting America's Cup from the United
States as captain of Australia II in 1983 _ and IBM veteran Dick
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The company's big splash, so to speak, was its coverage of the
1997-98 Whitbread Round the World Race. Its coverage blanketed the
nine-month boat race with video feeds and still photos, e-mail
reports from the crews involved and reports from journalists at
each port. The site generated $7 million in revenue and drew kudos
from the sports press. An estimated 1.8 million people viewed the
event.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Quokka has developed a Web site for the
International Olympic Committee ( &LR; www.olympic.com &LR; ), is producing
the online coverage of a solo around-the-world sailing race
( &LR; www.aroundalone.com &LR; ), and is in the process of creating pages
for an expedition in China.
</P>
<P>
   During the dangerous Around Alone race last month, Quokka made
headlines for telling the harrowing story of Russian sailor Viktor
Yazykov, who performed surgery on his badly infected elbow in the
middle of a South Atlantic storm. Yazykov received e-mail
instructions on his laptop computer from Dr. Daniel Carlin in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to tell the story from the inside out. We want
consumers to view events through the eyes, hearts and minds of
athletes,'' Ramadan said. ``It's like reading a novel instead of a
summary.''
</P>
<P>
   The new media company so far has the attention of traditional
broadcasters and established sports leagues. NBC and the NFL are
among the organizations that are discussing possible partnerships
with Quokka.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Time Digital recently named Ramadan one of its
50 most influential people, and the upstart has raised more than
$15 million in funding from Intel Corp., Stanford University, Accel
Partners, Trinity Ventures and others.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, a lineup of high-tech heavyweights _ led by
Intel, Compaq Computer and Eastman Kodak _ are working with Quokka
to develop this hybrid of digital sports entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``It can be one of the defining companies in establishing a
new model for digital media, and in establishing a combination of
new revenue streams,'' said Bruce Golden, of Accel Partners in Palo
Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers expect Quokka to reap revenues from banner
ads, sponsorships, product placements, e-commerce transactions,
pay-per-view events and digital rights. It isn't farfetched to
envision Quokka teaming up with NBC Sports to provide wall-to-wall
coverage of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while NBC could broadcast women's gymnastics and
cable network MSNBC handle a men's basketball game between Croatia
and Germany, Quokka could offer in-depth coverage of the men's
marathon and several other events _ all at the same time. In
essence, there is no limit to the number of ``channels'' that
Quokka can create on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``There is so much to cover at an Olympics; that's our big
programming challenge,'' said Bob Meyers, senior vice president of
NBC Interactive in New York. ``But the Net is a game changer: It
lets you watch whatever you want, when you want it. Television is
stricter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quokka won't replace or erode broadcast TV; rather, it will
enhance and supplement coverage,'' Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Quokka's goal is hardly a slam dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Its success is partially contingent on widespread use of digital
television and advancements in video-streaming technology, both of
which could be a few years away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they get a couple of lucky breaks and these technologies
improve, they could do incredible things,'' the NFL's Kirschner
said. ``But not everything is under their control.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential technological pitfalls hardly dissuade Ramadan and
crew, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be comfortable without a safety net because the
industry changes so fast,'' Ramadan said. ``Our company sheds its
skin every six months.''

AS IRELAND PROSPERS, THE POOR LAMENT A WIDENING CHASM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ Thanks to an economic boom in the last few
years, Ireland is the 19th richest country in the world, with the
fastest growth rate of any European Union nation. Immigration by
people looking for work here now exceeds the perennial emigration
to Britain and America.
</P>
<P>
   The average annual pay has risen to about $24,000, and the
government announced late last month that it had taken in a record
$1.4 billion in revenue in 1998, and expected the upward trend to
continue next year.
</P>
<P>
   But the gap between the poor, estimated at 20 percent of the
population of 3.6 million, and the well-to-do is apparently
widening. And there is a growing feeling in the grubby public
housing projects, especially in Dublin, that the Celtic Tiger, as
the boom is widely known, is the same old fat cat that ignores
them.
</P>
<P>
   The educated professionals and middle-class administrative and
technical workers are thriving, cramming the streets of Dublin with
thousands of new cars, and their prosperity has pushed up the cost
of housing by about 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But that only makes life more bleak for people like Helen
Delaney, 48, a single mother of six children who has lived for 20
years in the Ballymun high-rise public housing complex on the
northern edge of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I found the Celtic Tiger, I'd take him down to the Dublin
Corporation office and get them off their backsides, up here to do
what they're supposed to be doing _ fixing my flat,'' she said
recently.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty and resentment of Ballymun, where 20,000 people
live, received brief attention in the outside world in the 1991
film, ``The Commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   National unemployment has fallen from 20 percent, when the film
was released, to about 8 percent, well below the European Union
average. But in Ballymun and other poor areas of Dublin, like the
Docklands, unemployment averages about 40 percent. And there are
pockets where 90 percent of the people are out of work, many of
them for several years.
</P>
<P>
   They survive on welfare payments, called the dole, averaging a
little less than half the average wage for a family of four. The
official poverty line, based on European Union criteria, is half
the national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``People on the dole don't think about the Celtic Tiger as
relevant to their future,'' said James Hargis, manager of an
employment training program in the Docklands, near the River
Liffey.
</P>
<P>
   ``They find that the social welfare people are chasing them
more,'' he added, to see if they are taking welfare payments and at
the same time have found jobs in the underground or ``black''
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have Trinity College literally on our doorstep,'' he said,
but ``very few people in the Docklands would ever get there.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the main problems that keeps people here from profiting
from the boom is that about 40 percent of men over 35 are
functionally illiterate, descendants of dock workers whose jobs
disappeared 25 years ago with the arrival of huge container ships.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Trinity students help tutor children from the area
through the St. Andrew's Resource Center, operated with government
and private funds.
</P>
<P>
   The center finds work for about 200 people a year, mostly women,
who are more open to training programs than the men, many of whom
are ashamed to admit they cannot read a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Walsh, an economics professor at University College
Dublin, does not take an entirely pessimistic view. ``It's not as
if the Celtic Tiger zoomed ahead and left the elderly, the
unemployed, the disabled and single parents without support,'' he
said. ``Support has increased with inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Welfare payments have risen, he said, though they have not
matched the level of increased national income. ``Like many
developed or booming economies,'' he said, ``the gap between the
rich and the poor has widened. If you are a pessimist, you can say
that's terrible. If you are an optimist you can say everyone has
drifted up a little.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that because there is a cash-producing boom, there is
more begging on the streets of Dublin, some of it by immigrants
from Central and Eastern Europe and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   A little is not enough for the Rev. Sean Healy, director of the
Conference of Religious of Ireland, a gadfly group that prods the
government of Prime Minister Bertie Ahern to increase welfare
payments and expand employment programs.
</P>
<P>
   Healy, a former missionary in Africa who has a doctorate in
sociology from Fordham University, wants Ireland to become the
first country in Europe to establish a guaranteed annual income for
all citizens _ at an amount above the average public assistance
level.
</P>
<P>
   He concedes that this is unlikely, but he noted that Ahern, who
has been prime minister for 18 months, has recently begun to
acknowledge ``poverty and social exclusion'' in his public
speeches, and promises to do more to eliminate them.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that traditional Irish ``begrudgery,'' a widely
acknowledged national trait of resenting the success or good luck
of a neighbor, may be part of what makes people with jobs unwilling
to give more help to the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Begrudgery is beatable,'' he said. ``From the point of view of
Christian teaching, everybody is their brother's keeper.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His optimism is not in evidence at the Ballymun public housing
project, though. In the 15-story housing towers, the corridors reek
of urine and the elevators are often out of order. There are scores
of heroin addicts, and the principal amusement of many children is
riding and caring for the often scrawny horses that have long
roamed the grounds, to the dismay of city officials and animal
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   The government has said that it hopes, in the next several
years, to do what some American cities have done with high-rise
projects _ tear them down and replace them with low-rise housing
more conducive to family life.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Delaney, the mother of six children, who lives on the fifth
floor, said: ``When the lifts are broken I have to take my young
one out of school because I can go down the stairs with her, but I
can't come back up. She really needs to be in school at this stage,
since she's only starting. If I keep her out of school now she'll
think, `Great! The lifts in Ballymun let me stay home.'''
</P>
<P>
   She said the economic boom has only made things harder for
Ballymun residents and has made it even more difficult to
contemplate moving to private housing. Large food store chains have
beaten out smaller supermarkets, reducing competition, and food
prices have gone up.
</P>
<P>
   And a private house in the neighborhood that might have cost
$30,000 before the boom is now worth $200,000, putting escape from
public housing even farther out of the residents' reach.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Lee, 35, an unemployed hairdresser who runs a child care
program at the community center in Ballymun, said she was still
looking for an outside job, but the project has become a symbol for
poverty and crime in Ireland. ``If you're from Ballymun you won't
even get a reply,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lee contends that many of the people in Ballymun have the
skills and education to take advantage of the economic boom if it
were not for the bias against them. ``It's like that film, `Escape
From New York,' where they made New York a prison,'' she said.
``That's what Ballymun is like _ just dump everybody out there that
has any problems. Don't worry about the people who want to do
anything about themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that unemployment becomes an accepted way of life at
Ballymun. Her father, once a roofing contractor, was unemployed for
years. ``It was very depressing because you've lost your role
model,'' she said. ``There's a 10-year age gap between me and my
younger brother and sister. I've always worked, but my sister is
unemployed, and they don't want to work, because for them Dad never
worked.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she would stay at Ballymun, though, waiting for the
government to fulfill its promise to tear down the high rises and
put people in new houses.
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``It's terrible to have to turn to your child
and say, `No, you can't have that doll, it's 50 pounds''' _ about
$75 _ ```and I can't afford it.' I take her into town to show her
all the toys in the shops and it breaks her heart.''

</P>
<P>
   Saturday: Astounding.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday: All atwitter.
</P>
<P>
   Today through Jan. 4: Anticlimactic, with scattered acid raining
down on Columbus, Tucson and Manhattan, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Knock off Texas A&AMP;M, and K-State woulda still been
underqualified even to send its trombone section to the Fiesta
parade. Even that goal-line ref was doing the raise-the-roof call
on the A&AMP;M overtime TD.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies did everyone a huge favor by gagging Bill Snyder once

you get quick cash and buy a new defensive game plan. . . .

   _ If it's any consolation, Phoenix in January is . . . well . .

   _ Getting home-field advantage back can't be all stinky, unless
Bruins backers start giving up their luxurious Rose Bowl seats
again for the privilege of staying home and watching it hung-over.

   _ That craps game going on in Vegas with John ``Rebel With a
Lost Cause'' Robinson turned on him at the press conference when
UNLV introduced him as its new head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked how much money he'd be making. Robinson said it
was a ``private matter.'' UNLV president Carol Harter reminded him
that since this ain't no private high-falootin' university, his

Tampa Bay and Florida that he'd like to retire there. Brown says he
wants to play near his nest in Georgia, though best bet is him
staying kaput in San Diego. . . .

<P>
   _ Always good for a quote Billy Packer , on why there's no
complaint from fans about the NBA-less winter: ``They developed
entertainment fans, not basketball fans. That's why you're not
hearing much outcry because those fans have turned to movies or
music for the entertainment.'' . . .

BALF HITS THE WEB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's called balf _ a combination of the words
baseball and golf.
</P>
<P>
   It's played with a clat _ a combination of the words club and
bat.
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``The sport of the third millennium'' by its
founder, Mark Schuster of Crafton, Pa. That's a combination of hope
and hype.
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds too much like another twisted plot line for the
next movie from the ``South Park'' guys, check out the game's
official Web site ( http://balf.com ) for further clarification.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's been around officially since 1994, balf
tournaments seem to be (sort of) the rage in the Eastern part of
the country. Especially, for some reason, in North Mankato, Minn.
On Schuster's original site (
http:/members.aol.com/clatmaster/balf.htm ), still floating around
on the Web, there are names and numbers of those who were (and
could still be) interested in starting a league or tournament in
Valencia, Santa Barbara and Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   The balf site seems to also be the easiest place to buy the
tools of the trade _ a BalfClat driver (a fiberglass-covered 34
inch, 19 ounce stick) and a BalfClat putter (basically, a driver
with a putter head attached at the end of the barrel), used to hit
a regular old golf ball. At $89.98 a set, the clubs are a
registered trademark of Hillerich &AMP; Bradsby, the guys who make
Louisville Sluggers.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the official sport paraphernalia, such as balf
bags, sweat shirts and leather jackets (that are a bit pricey). So
someone must be serious about the game.
</P>
<P>
   Just one note of caution: Balf is not affiliated with the Boston
Adult Literacy Fund, which can be accessed
(http://www.tiac.net/users/balf/) by accident if one isn't careful
with the Yahoo search. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By electing James P. Hoffa its president, the
Teamsters union showed that it was willing to re-embrace the Hoffa
name. Now the question for the rest of the labor movement is
whether it is ready to do so as well.
</P>
<P>
   While publicly, at least, labor leaders on Sunday hailed Hoffa's
victory and pledged to work with him, leaders and rank-and-file
alike remember his father's mob ties and fear that Hoffa will allow
corruption to flourish again in the Teamsters, setting back the
whole labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   But many experts say that Hoffa's potential upside may be as big
as his potential downside, noting that if the man with the most
famous last name in labor proves to be an honest, dynamic leader as
promised, he will give the movement a much-needed shot in the arm.
</P>
<P>
   While Hoffa's path remains unclear, one thing is certain:
overnight he has become one of labor's two most prominent
spokesmen, sharing the spotlight with _ some would say stealing it
from _ the AFL-CIO's president, John J. Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa captured the presidency on Saturday when his main
opponent, Tom Leedham, conceded defeat. In declaring victory Sunday
on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press,'' Hoffa said it was time
to get past the legacy of his father, James Riddle Hoffa, who led
the union from 1957 to 1971, and who disappeared in 1975 after
being released from prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 1998,'' Hoffa said. ``People want to start over.''
</P>
<P>
   Some labor experts say that friction could develop between Hoffa
and Sweeney and other AFL-CIO leaders over some of the old-style
union barons who were key to his victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be some uneasiness in the relationship between
Hoffa and the AFL-CIO leadership,'' said Richard Hurd, a professor
of labor relations at Cornell University. ``The AFL-CIO's leaders
came into power talking about the need to change very dramatically
from the past, and to some people Hoffa represents the old way of
doing things.''
</P>
<P>
   One issue that may prove divisive is labor's involvement in
politics. Hoffa has repeatedly criticized his predecessor, Ron
Carey, and the Sweeney-led AFL-CIO for overwhelmingly backing
Democrats. He has said that the Teamsters will make sure to support
labor-friendly Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be bipartisan,'' Hoffa said on ``Meet the
Press.'' ``We're going to try to find people on both sides of the
aisle who support our agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Some labor experts say this new political tilt stems partly from
the fact that Hoffa's father was hounded by the Democratic
Kennedys, while it was a Republican, President Richard M. Nixon,
who eventually commuted his father's prison sentence after he was
convicted of fraud and jury tampering.
</P>
<P>
   But some of Sweeney's allies say that Hoffa's strategy is
essentially the same as that of the AFL-CIO, which in the past year
has moved away from reflexively backing only Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``His approach and the federation's aren't all that different,''
said Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees. ``Our union and the federation are
not captive to the Democratic Party. This year we supported more
Republicans than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, a Detroit labor lawyer, takes over the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, one of the nation's most powerful unions,
after it has floundered for more than a year, ever since Carey, the
previous president, was sidelined by a campaign-finance scandal.
Hoffa promises to make the 1.4 million-member union a powerful
player again, vowing that it will throw its weight around in
politics, organizing and contract talks.
</P>
<P>
   Many union leaders may be uneasy about his last name and the
baggage it carries, but they say it is important for all of labor
that the Teamsters are no longer leaderless or rudderless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has the potential to be a great leader,'' Sweeney
said in an interview Sunday. ``I think that the most important part
of all this is that a very strong union that has a long, rich
history has finally got a leader again.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago there were bitter tensions between Sweeney and Hoffa,
but union officials say they have largely patched up their
differences. The tensions stem from 1996, when Sweeney, Richard
Trumka, the federation's secretary-treasurer, and some allies
heading powerful unions not so subtly backed their friend, Carey,
over Hoffa in the 1996 Teamsters race. Carey, who was instrumental
in helping Sweeney gain the AFL-CIO's helm, won that race but the
victory was overturned and he was expelled from the Teamsters
because three aides had steered union money to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa said Sunday that it would be a ``challenge'' to get along
with Sweeney. ``You know the AFL-CIO interfered in our elections on
behalf of Carey,'' he said. ``Nevertheless, we are willing to turn
the page on that.''
</P>
<P>
   But another possible source of new tensions is that, in the view
of many Sweeney supporters, Hoffa and some of his allies typify
old-style, top-down unionism. Sweeney, Carey and other Sweeney
backers have embraced a bottom-up style that emphasizes
rank-and-file participation as a way to increase a union's power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the reaction is, there they go again, the Teamsters
are doing their old thing,'' said Michael Belzer, a professor of
labor relations at the University of Michigan and former truck
driver who used to support Carey. ``For those who support the new
bottom-up approach that Sweeney is pushing, Hoffa doesn't represent
a hopeful sign.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hoffa's supporters say his critics misread him, noting that
he promises to unite the members and involve the rank and file
more.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the biggest concern that many labor leaders have about
Hoffa _ one they do not want to discuss publicly _ is his ties to
some questionable figures.
</P>
<P>
   One of Hoffa's closest allies is Larry Brennan, the powerful
head of the Teamsters in Michigan. He had a major hand in running a
union welfare fund, which federal officials criticized for
misappropriating $725,000. And a federal monitor criticized Brennan
for giving his subordinates $30,000 in raises and then having them
funnel that money into his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa received some bad news this weekend when a court-appointed
review board charged Tom O'Donnell, a New York Teamster running for
vice president on the Hoffa slate, with filing false campaign
finance reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent Review Board asserted that O'Donnell, who heads
a local of movie truck drivers, failed to disclose that the Hoffa
campaign was paying an aide, Kevin Currie, who was a convicted
felon. The report stated that to hide Currie's role, the Hoffa
treasury was paying Currie's wife, who did not work in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell could be suspended or expelled as a result of these
charges. He could not be reached for comment Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa's critics say he must have known about the falsehoods
regarding Currie, but a Hoffa spokesman denied that he had any
knowledge of it.
</P>
<P>
   But Hurd said he doubted that the allegations of Mr. Hoffa's
ties to unsavory characters would stop other union leaders from
cooperating with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think most labor leaders are going to lose any
sleep over Jimmy Hoffa's connections with organized crime,''
Professor Hurd said. ``Labor leaders have proved amazingly adept at
avoiding these kinds of issues so that they can work together when
they want.''

FORMER COUP LEADER WINS VENEZUELEAN PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: 2NDTAKE will move by 9:30 p.m. ET.)

<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ With fireworks crackling and horns blaring,
the boulevards filled with music, Venezuelans on Sunday night
celebrated the overwhelming election victory of Hugo Chavez in a
historic vote that delivered the former coup leader the presidency
he failed to seize by force six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The former lieutenant colonel, who on Sunday defeated
Yale-educated businessman Henrique Salas Romer, is the first leader
in 40 years who has not come from Venezuela's dominant political
parties, and his meteoric success among legions of disaffected
voters smashed the old-line party machinery long before election
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viva Venezuela! Viva Chavez!'' shouted euphoric crowds who
filled a main avenue on Sunday night. They chanted demands to
rewrite the 1961 Constitution, which has ensured the rule of the
elite for 40 years of Venezuela's democracy. ``Chavez: A National
Feeling,'' announced a tall yellow banner raised to serve as the
triumphant candidate's backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   As the streets throbbed with the joy of his supporters, nobody
was really sure what Venezuela would look like under Chavez, who
has been called a nationalist, a Communist, a hero and a would-be
dictator. During the campaign, he frequently sported the red beret
of the military special forces he once led to storm the
presidential palace and called on supporters to crush ``los
corruptos'' on election day.
</P>
<P>
   A fiery orator who has visited Cuba and praised President Fidel
Castro, Chavez has become the symbol of hope through radical change
for the four out of five Venezuelans who live in poverty, and the
dangerous devil to the 20 percent who do not.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the announcement of his victory, Chavez
pledged to seek moderation and foster forgiveness, after a campaign
rife with disinformation, innuendo and dirty tricks. Just days ago,
at his closing rally in downtown Caracas, he had warned 700,000
supporters about the prospect they might lose the election through
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, he told his supporters to ``celebrate, but with
humility, even with silence, with reflection. It's not about
sticking your head out of the window, because tomorrow we begin
another battle'' to rebuild Venezuela, he said. He called on
Venezuelans to build ``with harmony, and with a great capacity for
forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who have made mistakes, we say, `So did we.' Let's
forgive each other our errors,'' Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   With 78 percent of the vote counted, Chavez had 56 percent
compared to 40 percent for Salas, according to official results
from the National Electoral Council.
</P>
<P>
   Conceding defeat on Sunday at his campaign headquarters in
Caracas, Salas said that ``not only do I accept my adversary's
victory, I also wish him much luck because his luck is Venezuela's
luck.''

ELWAY RALLIES UNBEATEN BRONCOS IN FINAL MINUTES
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Broncos are making their quest to remain undefeated
interesting. After doing everything they could to give the game
away to the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday, the Broncos improved to
13-0 with a 35-31 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback John Elway led Denver to two touchdowns in the final
eight minutes to keep the perfect season alive. Tight end Shannon
Sharpe caught safety Reggie Tongue asleep in the secondary with 3
minutes 34 seconds remaining for the game-winner _ Denver's first
lead of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs had one last drive, which was kept alive when
linebacker John Mobley was called for pass interference on tight
end Tony Gonzalez, putting the Chiefs at the Denver 36. But they
could not move the ball, and the game was over when, on
fourth-and-10 at the 36, quarterback Rich Gannon was sacked by
defensive lineman Alfred Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs were able to take advantage of several Broncos
miscues, including a Terrell Davis fumble inside the Kansas City
1-yard line, an Elway interception at the goal line, and a bobbled
snap on a Denver punt. Then Kansas City lineman Leslie O'Neal
blocked a 37-yard Jason Elam field goal early in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the Broncos were not crisp for the second consecutive
week.
</P>
<P>
   The score was tied at 21-21 until the Chiefs went on an 80-yard
drive, with Gannon (27 of 43 for 240 yards) making good decisions
and the Chiefs' coaches calling smart plays, mixing screens with
well-timed short passes. The drive ended with a 26-yard touchdown
pass to wide receiver Joe Horn, who beat defensive back Tito Paul,
for a 28-21 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After the blocked field goal, the Chiefs did not waste time
trying to take the life out of the Broncos. They converted a
fourth-and-1 at the Denver 28 when running back Bam Morris dived
for almost 2 yards. The drive stalled at the Broncos' 3, but a
field goal by Pete Stoyanovich gave Kansas City a 31-21 lead with
8:25 left.
</P>
<P>
   Denver has one of the most potent offenses in football and it
showed on their next series. They struck back quickly, in under two
minutes, keyed by a 50-yard pass from Elway (22 of 32 for 400
yards) to Green. Davis scored from 1-yard out and the Broncos
trailed just by 3 points.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Sharpe catch, his only one of the game, and
Denver's quest stayed alive.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Call this game The Brawl, Part II. The first time these two
teams played, in Kansas City, Sharpe did as much taunting of Chiefs
fans as he did of Chiefs players.
</P>
<P>
   The real action in that game was on the field. It was one of the
nastiest games of the season, and Chiefs Coach Marty Schottenheimer
said it was an embarrassment to his organization. Linebacker
Derrick Thomas was called for three personal fouls in the final
minutes of the game, and Chiefs defensive lineman Wayne Simmons had
one. Thomas was suspended for one game by the team, and Simmons was
sent packing.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Sharpe's tongue instigated the events, but he had
boycotted the news media all this past week because he did not want
the incident to become a distraction. Before the game, Sharpe
approached Thomas, and the two hugged at the 30-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   This game was much cleaner, but in some ways it was more
shocking.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe inspired by how they were manhandled the first time the
teams met this season, a 30-7 Broncos' victory, the Chiefs played
inspired football. They were able to slow Davis and the running
game as well as take advantage of Broncos turnovers, such as punter
Tom Rouen's fumbling a snap that Kansas City recovered. On the very
next play, Andre Rison ran a crisp post pattern for a 31-yard
touchdown and a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's offense was again stifled, and the Chiefs took
advantage this time with a Kimble Ambers 11-yard touchdown pass to
take a 14-0 lead, and the stadium was eerily quiet.
</P>
<P>
   But the Broncos, as they do better than almost any team, made
adjustments on both sides of the ball. Noticing how the Chiefs were
jumping a lot of their short routes, wide receiver Rod Smith went
deep for a 58-yard reception. Three plays later, Davis went up the
gut for a 1-yard score to put the Broncos back in the game, 14-7.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Kansas City scored again when Morris leaped into the
end zone from two feet out for a 21-7 lead _ the drive was keyed by
a 28-yard pass-interference call on cornerback Darrien Gordon, who
grabbed wide receiver Derrick Alexander _ there was never a feeling
that the Broncos were going to lose control of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a physical game, with hard hitting in every phase.
Before the Bronocs cut the score to 21-14 with 6 minutes 31 seconds
left in the first half, they had a first-and-goal at the 1. Davis
did not gain on the first play, nor on the second as he was pounded
at the line of scrimmage. He finally snuck in on third down.

ADS TAILORED TO WEB USERS 
ALARMING ORNAMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Imagine that, as you drive down the road, each billboard you
pass instantly changes to advertise a product tailored to your
specific tastes and needs.
 &HT;    That might be impossible to do on a highway. But some companies
are striving to do the equivalent on the Internet. Vignette and
Broadvision, for example, are two companies that draw on a computer
user's browsing and buying history to customize online shopping.
 &HT;    Be Free Inc., a small start-up in Marlborough, Mass., that
recently received a $17.6 million infusion of venture capital, says
it expects to be awarded a patent Tuesday for a method of passively
collecting behavioral profiles and psychographic data (information
about attitudes and lifestyles) for individual computer users,
storing this information in a huge database and then using it to
decide what consumers should see which advertisements.
 &HT;    Many Web surfers already experience tailored advertising. If you
buy John Grisham's latest from Amazon.com, for example, the next
time you visit the site you are likely to find several other legal
thrillers on a recommended book list.
 &HT;    But that targeting takes place within a specific web site. Be
Free says its patented system can acquire this information from
thousands of Web sites and then correlate it to develop
well-rounded profiles of consumers.
 &HT;    Tom Gerace, 27, started the company three years ago with his
brother Sam Gerace, 35. Be Free does not yet provide its proposed
service but plans to do so by late summer or early fall of next
year. ``We've got to have relatively large data collection,'' Tom
Gerace said. ``We've been collecting data for 13 months now, and we
have 20 million unique user profiles.''
 &HT;    The company currently specializes in what is known as affiliate
marketing, putting in place technology that enables online
companies to pay commissions to content providers who send paying
customers their way. Among its clients, Be Free says, are
Barnesandnoble.com., owned by Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc.; Reel.com, owned
by Hollywood Entertainment Corp., and Travelocity, owned by
Microsoft Corp.
 &HT;    ``We have watched an anonymous consumer view the weather in
North Carolina every two weeks, buy golf books and then buy golf
clubs,'' said Tom Gerace, executive vice president of business
development at Be Free. ``When they see a promotion on Travelocity,
they should see a promotion for golf vacations. But today they're
as likely to see an ad for steaks or for stock quotes.''
 &HT;    Be Free contends that its technology _ which makes use of such
electronic trail markers as ``cookies'' and digital certificates _
does not threaten consumer privacy.
 &HT;    ``We don't collect data that can be used in any way to match
this profile with a real-world person,'' Tom Gerace said. ``We
create a firewall between this rich behavioral information and the
living, breathing human being behind it.''
 &HT;    Will the patent raise eyebrows in the marketplace, as several
involving electronic commerce already have? Engage Technologies,
for example, drew attention when it announced in August that it had
compiled a database of 30 million digital dossiers very similar to
the type Be Free says it has patented.
 &HT;    ``There will be a number of people who will be concerned about
the patent and whether they violate it,'' Tom Gerace said.
``Obviously, we can leverage the patent in a number of different
ways to strike partnerships. But it's not our goal to be
litigious.''
 &HT;    Ken Cassar, an analyst at Jupiter Communications, a new-media
research firm, has not read the patent, which Be Free applied for
in 1995. But based on Be Free's description, he said, it may well
turn out to be a headache for competitors.
 &HT;    ``Patents can really shake a market up and put the squeeze on
companies that have been doing something for a while but didn't
apply for a patent,'' he said.
 &HT;    ``The Patent Office has got to be realizing that they need to
streamline the process,'' he added. ``The marketplace is moving so
fast. A three-year delay is decades on the Internet.''
 &HT;    Be Free Inc. expects to receive patent 5,848,396 on Tuesday.

SHUTTLE ASTRONAUTS JOIN FIRST TWO PIECES OF SPACE STATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following a series of intricate maneuvers and the
skillful use of the space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm, astronauts
on Sunday joined the first two of many segments that will form the
international space station.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle and its crew of six snared the Russian-made Zarya
control module after chasing it around the Earth in ever-closing
orbits throughout the day. Less than an hour after a rendezvous 240
miles above the Earth shortly before 6 p.m., Lt. Col. Nancy Currie
of the Army deftly used the 50-foot arm to grab the 40,000-pound
cylinder as the craft passed above Russia and to slowly pull it
toward the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Zarya up close, Col. Robert Cabana of the Marines, the
shuttle commander, confirmed that two antennas had failed to deploy
from the module following its launch from Kazakhstan on Nov. 20.
There were earlier indications that the antennas, which will be
used later by the station to manually assist spacecraft dockings,
had not extended.
</P>
<P>
   Currie took almost two hours to painstakingly move Zarya above
the American-made Unity docking port positioned in Endeavour's
cargo bay. When the two pieces were aligned within inches of one
another, Cabana fired small thruster rockets that raised the
shuttle, allowing the modules to clamp together.
</P>
<P>
   The two station pieces, together measuring about 77 feet from
end to end and having a combined mass of 70,000 pounds, are the
first of 100 major components to be united in space over the next
five years to form an orbiting outpost that would weigh almost a
million pounds and span an area the size of two football fields.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 additional missions by U.S. shuttles and Russian
rockets will be used to haul all of the components and other
supplies into orbit, and astronauts from both nations are to spend
almost 1,800 hours doing spacewalks to assemble the entire
structure. The spece station is expected to cost its partnership of
16 nations more than $40 billion just to construct.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing the pieces together is only the first step in mating
them. A pair of astronauts are to make three spacewalks this week,
the first on Monday, during which they will hook up electrical and
communications cables, remove covers, attach handrails and perform
other tasks to get the modules to work as one unit.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult part of Sunday's mating of the $240 million
Zarya to the $300 million Unity was bringing them together after
the shuttle caught up with the Russian unit. Currie had to use the
Canadian-built robot arm to place Zarya on top of Unity without
being able to see where the pieces joined. Unity, raised in
Endeavour's cargo bay on Saturday, is so large that it blocked
Currie's view of the mating fixtures from the shuttle's windows.
</P>
<P>
   She used views from remote cameras and a computerized vision
system built on the arm to estimate the relative positions of the
two large segments. The computerized system examined markings on
both modules, computed their relationship to one another using the
marks and displayed the results on a laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never done anything like this before,'' Currie said
before the flight, adding that she had practiced the difficult
maneuver more than 100 times over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   The flight of Endeavour, which took off from Cape Canaveral,
Fla., last Friday, had gone according to plan until early Sunday,
when mission control ordered the shuttle to change its orbit
slightly to avoid a piece of space debris. Air Force space debris
trackers noted that the shuttle was to pass within 1.6 miles of a
spent stage of an American booster rocket launched last month.
</P>
<P>
   Although this was considered a safe distance, shuttle
controllers decided to widen the separation to five miles as an
extra precaution.

 CARACAS, VENEUELA: Venezuela's luck.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chavez called on the banking and private sector to bring back
assets and investment capital sent abroad, precisely out of fear he
would win Sunday's election. Chavez offered to open talks with the
private sector, adding, ``Venezuela needs you, it needs friends.''
He told business leaders he wanted to understand ``how to interpret
your expectations, your anxieties, your aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   But initially, those appeals seemed to draw little more than
skepticism. Eric Ekvall, a political consultant here, was watching
Chavez's interview with a group of very wary business executives.
</P>
<P>
   When the president-elect called for the repatriation of capital,
``There was a whoop of derisive laughter from the group here,''
Ekvall said. The reaction, he added, ``sets the tone for how a lot
of the business community here is going to react to him in the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of massive fraud, of a post-election settling of scores,
and threats of rioting ran like rivers through the capital in the
days leading up to the election on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Though Chavez had been leading in election polls by 15 to 22
points, veteran political analysts said on Sunday night they were
still surprised that the old parties released their once-iron
fisted hold on power under the weight of the democratic will.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are historic elections,'' the American ambassador here,
John Maisto, said in an interview with reporters before the Chavez
victory. ``Nothing like these elections has happened in Venezuela's
history.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador also said Washington would ``work with any
government, no matter who is elected.'' Previously, the Clinton
administration had denied Chavez a visa, citing his role in the
attempted coup, but a State Department spokesman suggested last
week that Chavez might have better luck securing a visa next time.
The rejection, he said, ``is in the past, and the future we will
deal with at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   After trying, and failing, to seize power in two attempted coups
against Carlos Andres Perez in 1992, Chavez became a symbol for
Venezuelans impatient with corruption and misery amid vast oil
wealth. Chavez went to jail for two years, but Perez lost as well:
he was impeached to face corruption charges a year later. The
paratrooper's popularity grew.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His statements have fallen all over the political map, often
depending on his audiences, although he has generally moved toward
the center in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Educated Venezuelans doubt Chavez's devotion to democracy, while
the poor say democracy here has been little more than a cover for
institutional corruption. Venezuela is the leading exporter of oil
to the United States, and the biggest oil producing country outside
the Middle East, but 40 percent of its people live in dire poverty,
unable to afford a nourishing diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We voted Chavez because we want a change, not a
dictatorship,'' said Kurokwis Escobar, 35, who paints cars for a
living.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we need a change,'' declared Hughes Castilla
Molina, 52, who owns an auto repair shop. ``If you say we're going
to lose our liberty, I say we've lost it already. At least we'll
have a change. We'll have education, health care, and housing,
which we don't have now. That's the popular clamor.''
</P>
<P>
   From the poor hillside slums like Petare to the posh, tree-lined
streets of Altamir, Venezuelans turned out in record numbers to
vote in an election freighted with a sense of history in the
making.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-day, the number of voters at polling stations around
Caracas had exceeded the total balloting in congressional and state
elections a month ago, when Chavez's Patriotic Pole won a plurality
with a third of the legislature and eight of the 23 governorships.
</P>
<P>
   For 40 years, the two traditional parties, Democratic Action and
Copei, had shared the spoils of power in this oil-rich nation, and
by the end of voting, their long day in the sun had come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the two parties fielded no candidates for
president, and instead threw their support behind Salas in an
unsuccessful, last ditch effort to tip the election in his favor.

THE JETS RECEIVE AN EARLY CHRISTMAS PRESENT
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ You probably never heard the name Earnie
Frantz until now, but the New York Jets should cast his upraised
arms in bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Frantz, the head linesman who was positioned on the sideline,
signaled that Vinny Testaverde had scored on a fourth-down 5-yard
quarterback sneak with 20 seconds remaining for the 32-31 victory
over the Seattle Seahawks that anointed these Jets as a team that
can come back to win a game that appeared lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a pileup,'' referee Phil Luckett said later, ``but
the head linesman had already called a touchdown for the ball
breaking the plane and despite the pileup of players, the decision
had already been made.''
</P>
<P>
   On several television replays from different camera angles,
Testaverde appeared to have been stopped short of the goal line.
And the Jets' descriptions of their early Christmas present sounded
more grateful than convincing _ even Testaverde's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The referee called it good,'' the Jets quarterback said.
``Sometimes you can't see. I felt like I was over.''
</P>
<P>
   From near the Jets' bench, Parcells couldn't see whether
Testaverde had scored or not, but he could see Frantz peering at
the play from the same sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the guy on the right signal immediately,'' Parcells
said, meaning Frantz, ``so I thought he was in.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Mawae, the Jets center who was blocking for Testaverde,
also didn't insist that Testaverde had scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the call is made, they very rarely call back a
touchdown,'' Mawae said. ``Maybe that's another reason why instant
replay would work.''
</P>
<P>
   Mawae paused and added, ``For them,'' meaning the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Instant replay, which the National Football League used as an
officating tool from 1986 to 1991 to correct officials' mistakes,
has been rejected every year since then in a vote of the clubs.
Both the Jets and the Seahawks voted to reinstall it at last
March's league meeting, but the 21-9 ``yes'' vote was 2 short of
the required 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Considering Sunday outcome, the Jets must be delighted that
instant replay was voted down; the Seahawks surely aren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' said Seahawk Coach Dennis Erickson, ``it's
something they're going to have to take a look at again.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of his Seahawk players were not so diplomatic. Defensive
end Michael Sinclair even invoked the Wizard of Oz.
</P>
<P>
   ``They,'' said Sinclair, referring to the officials, ``need to
go see the the Wizard. No heart. No courage.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't say no consistency, however. Luckett and his crew were
the same seven officials who made several controversial calls in
the Steelers-Lions game on Thanksgiving Day that in Detroit,
including the overtime coin-toss fiasco. Steeler running back
Jerome Bettis yelled ``tails,'' the coin came up ``tails'' but
Luckett proclaimed that the Lions had won the toss.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the N.F.L. office had said anything to Luckett's crew
because of the coin-toss controversy as well as the controversial
calls in New England's 25-21 victory over Buffalo a week ago,
Luckett said, ``I think you should take that up with the league
office.'' Asked if they had been asked to do anything different,
Luckett repeated the same answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even I looked over at the head linesman,'' Luckett said of the
winning touchdown, ``and he had signaled well before the pileup of
players so the decision had indeed been made.''
</P>
<P>
   That decision sent the Jets soaring with a 9-4 record into their
final three games, all against divisional opponents _ at Miami next
Sunday night, at Buffalo on Saturday afternoon, and against the
Patriots at Giants Stadium in their season finale on Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   If the Jets win all three games, they are assured of their first
East Division title since the 1969 season.
</P>
<P>
   But the availability of Aaron Glenn, their Pro Bowl cornerback,
is uncertain. After being beaten by Seahawk wide receiver Joey
Galloway on touchdown passes of 70 and 57 yards, Glenn severely
sprained his right ankle while intercepting another deep pass to
Galloway in the second quarter. The Jets sounded secretive on the
extent of Glenn's sprain.
</P>
<P>
   His right shoe off, Glenn rode a cart to the X-ray room. The
Jets announced later that Glenn had a sprained ankle, but there was
no X-ray report as such. When asked about Glenn later, the only
word was that the Jets would know more about his condition today.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, with Ray Mickens covering Galloway after Glenn
departed, quarterback Jon Kitna threw only two more passes to
Galloway, both incomplete. The Jets' defense blanked the Seahawks
in the final quarter, enabling the offense to rally from a 31-19
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Belichick told me to mix things up on Galloway, to bump
him and then play off him,'' Mickens said, referring to the Jets
assistant coach and defensive guru. ``When Galloway sees bump, he
goes fade. When he sees me off him, he goes short.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last quarter, Pepper Johnson was telling us we had to
win a game like this. And now the chips are stacked.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickens meant the chips on the poker table that is now the
Eastern Division of the American Football Conference, the chips
that Mickens will be playing with if Glenn is out.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Jets go on to win their division and perhaps beyond,
they will remember Earnie Frantz with fondness. Cast the head
linesman's upraised arms in bronze. If not gold. &QL;

HOLYFIELD-LEWIS: THE TIME HAS COME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Evander Holyfield, as cocky as you'll ever see
him, was referring to Lennox Lewis' prolonged efforts to reach a
deal on their March 13 fight when he said: ``You better be careful
what you wish for, you might get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Lewis has known all along that Holyfield is no Oliver
McCall, no Henry Akinwande, no Andrew Golota _ opponents who broke
down one way or another against Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, in spite of the big words spoken at a news conference
last week at the Olympic Auditorium to promote the fight, knows
that Lewis could pose the biggest challenge of his career.
</P>
<P>
   And, most significant to the rest of us, we know it too.
</P>
<P>
   It all makes for one of the most compelling heavyweight matchups
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The fight will unify the titles for the first time since Riddick
Bowe tossed the WBC belt into a trash can after he took the three
major championships from Holyfield in 1992. Holyfield now owns the
WBA and IBF versions of the title, Lewis the WBC.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, ungodly sums of money will be reaped by both fighters;
Holyfield $20 million-plus, Lewis $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, this is about more than money and titles _ particularly
in an era when titles have lost their meaning.
</P>
<P>
   In one of its rare triumphs, boxing got it right: This is about
the best against the best, a fight between the two premier
heavyweights on the planet to determine the true king of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Who will win? It's a tossup, which makes the event all the more
tantalizing. A typical discussion about the fight raises more
questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   At 36, how much more fight does Holyfield have in him?
</P>
<P>
   And many bring up Bowe and ask: Will Holyfield struggle again
against a much taller fighter? Holyfield is 6-foot-2, Lewis 6-6.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, who won, lost and won in three fights against Bowe,
scoffed at the latter notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had problems in the first (Bowe) fight because I fought his
fight. I exchanged (punches) inside,'' Holyfield said. ``I did
better the second fight because I fought my fight. I boxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fight will be no problem if I fight my fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions also surround Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly, he has never been in the ring with a warrior
like Holyfield. In fact, he hasn't fought any of the top
heavyweights of the past decade: Holyfield, Bowe, Tyson or Michael
Moorer, all of whom he says have avoided him.
</P>
<P>
   Does Lewis have the stomach for such a challenge?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, no heavyweight has the big-fight experience of
Holyfield. How will this disparity play out?
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Lewis is confident but sensible. He seems to have
a keen sense of his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad he's not like those other guys,'' said Lewis,
referring to Akinwande, Golota and McCall, the last of whom broke
down in tears during their fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hate to think that we'd go into the ring and all of a
sudden Evander Holyfield starts crying, or starts holding me. It
would be a shock to me. I know he's going to show true grit. That's
him.''
</P>
<P>
   For Holyfield, this fight could be another significant triumph
in a remarkable career _ or the end. For Lewis, it could be his
long-awaited rise to the top of the sport _ or proof he was never
the fighter he claimed to be.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis can't wait to find out what the answers are.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said be careful what you wish for, but I've been wishing
for this for seven years,'' he said. ``I couldn't be happier my
wish came true.''
</P>
<P>
   We all feel that way.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson watch: Greg Garrison, the man who prosecuted Tyson during
his trail for rape, doesn't believe the fighter's no contest plea
to misdemeanor assault charges in Maryland will send him back to
jail for violation of his parole.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Patricia Gifford, who presided over Tyson's rape trial in
Indianapolis, will determine the fighter's fate after Tyson is
sentenced early next year on the assault charges. He is accused of
kicking and punching two motorists after a traffic accident in
August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most NFL players do more than that before lunchtime,''
Garrison told the New York Daily News. ``I'm no fan of his, but I
don't see this being too important at all. (Gifford) sees so many
things worse than this, I can't imagine she would care too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson also could face a jail term based on the incident alone.
</P>
<P>
   Bad move: Oscar De La Hoya should remove those responsible for
removing a KCAL reporter and cameraman at an event to honor the
fighter for asking a question about rape allegations.
</P>
<P>
   You don't tell a reporter not to do his or her job. De La Hoya
should simply have said: ``I'm sorry. My attorneys have advised me
not to comment on this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, who said in response to the question that he's had a
difficult time the past few weeks, is accused of raping a girl 2{
years ago in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: A wonderful card is set for Saturday on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Gatti faces Ivan Robinson in a rematch of their war and
Yory Boy Campas defends his IBF junior middleweight title against
Fernando Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   It's unusual to have one such compelling matchup on a card, let
alone two. . . .
</P>
<P>
   If Vargas takes away Campas' title, his promoter, Dino Duva,
wants to schedule his first defense in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Auditorium is the leading contender in a search for
a site. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Duva and Don King are negotiating a fight between IBF
welterweight champ Felix Trinidad and former champion Pernell
Whitaker, although talks are in the early stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it's 50-50 right now that it will happen,'' Duva said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker, who has struggled with substance abuse, has been
licensed to fight again and is working out. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Italian judge Franco Priami, who scored Saturday's Johnny
Tapia-Nana Konadu fight even, should have his license revoked.
</P>
<P>
   Tapia pitched a near shutout to win the title. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Heavyweight contender Ed Mahone faces Booker Word in a 10-round
bout tonight at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   In his last bout, Mahone drew with Al Williams when Williams
claimed he couldn't continue because of an accidental head butt in
the sixth round. The draw ended Mahone's knockout streak at 18. &QL;

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW ORLEANS _ This is how it began: Emmitt Smith took a handoff on
the first play from scrimmage and was nailed by Mark Fields for a
four-yard loss. On the second play, Troy Aikman was called for
intentional grounding out of his end zone, resulting in a safety.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it ended: With Smith getting stopped by Wayne Martin
one yard short of the end zone, finishing a series of eight
straight plays from the eight-yard line and in on which Dallas
couldn't punch the ball across the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   In between, the Cowboys were worse.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't merely the notion that the Saints could put an ugly
22-3 tattoo on his team that bothered Chan Gailey. It was the way
they did it that had the first-year head coach seething with anger.
</P>
<P>
   His voice wasn't raised, but his blood pressure certainly was.
He wasn't outwardly hot, just inwardly boiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a sorry display of offense we had out there today,'' he
said. ``We got the dog beat out of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of work to do to get to where we think we'll
have a chance to compete in the playoffs. It's not a lot of fun in
our locker room right now, and it won't be until we get this thing
straightened out.''
</P>
<P>
   Which might not be so easy. Against a New Orleans defense that
is by no means considered awesome, the Cowboys' offense was more
twisted and bent than Quasimodo trying to do a backflip.
</P>
<P>
   But the Saints thoroughly overpowered the Cowboys' offensive
line, stuffed Smith like a Christmas turkey and kept pressure on
Aikman all day long.
</P>
<P>
   The grisly details said Smith carried the ball 15 times and
gained a total of six yards. On a half-dozen occasions, Smith's
efforts resulted in negative yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worst day ever,'' he said. ``Had to be. What could have been
worse?''
</P>
<P>
   How about an entire Cowboys running game that ground out a total
of eight yards? That makes for the single worst rushing day in the
long history of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't take numbers or historical rankings to tell the
story. It only required a glimpse or two or three at the times that
Saints defenders penetrated Dallas' offensive line and delivered
assorted hits that could be felt from the upper decks of the
Superdome all the way to Bourbon Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints came at the offensive line, which used to be the
strength of the Cowboys, with a steady diet of an unexpected run
blitz, and the Cowboys reacted as if they had just been handed a
copy of the Dead Sea Scrolls and asked to translate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't make the proper adjustments,'' said Gailey. ``We
didn't do any of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the possibility is that the Cowboys had been checking
out those standings in the NFC Least and, at 8-4 entering the game,
somehow got their inflated record confused with the formerly
dominant Dallas teams of the Super Bowl era.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, they are still an unproven bunch. While capable of
piling up large offensive numbers as they did in the shootout loss
to Minnesota on Thanksgiving, the Cowboys are not that far removed
from the mediocrity that inhabits much of the NFL. Which means that
in order to succeed and win games, they can't afford to come out
with anything less than an all-out effort, no matter whom they are
playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be unhappy to hear that anybody on our team took the
Saints lightly,'' said Aikman. ``Maybe it could have happened. I
just know that I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   With Deion Sanders still hobbled, with Kevin Smith emotionally
crippled, with Kevin Mathis trying to play cornerback with a cast
on his right arm, it was expected that the defense would have its
problems. Which it did. The Saints ground out a pair of 12-play
drives covering 80 and 45 yards and also scored on an 89-yard
touchdown pass from Kerry Collins to Andre Hastings.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the offensive breakdown that was much more alarming
as Dallas could never get going or score a touchdown. Even just for
pride in the dying minutes of the game. Even when a
pass-interference call in the end zone gave the Cowboys
first-and-goal at the one.
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL used the BCS computer to make postseason matchups
like the colleges, just figure the Cowboys would be lucky to make
the Independence Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   They were coming off their annual 10-day break following the
Thanksgiving game and figured to be fresh. They could have won and
officially wrapped up the division title. They could have told
themselves they would be a real factor in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, we went and got embarrassed,'' said left guard Nate
Newton. ``Now, it's a rat race.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes it's hard to tell the vermin apart.

BRUINS BLUE, HEAD FOR SIESTA BOWL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Are you ready for the Doze Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the Bowl Championship Series announced Sunday that
deflated UCLA will meet Wisconsin _ the third-best team in the Big
Ten _ in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1. The Bruins were ranked fifth in
the final BCS poll.
</P>
<P>
   Because no current players have experienced a Rose Bowl, the
Bruins probably will get excited for the game as the New Year
approaches and the sting of Saturday's defeat abates.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, they are disappointed, angry and embarrassed
about their 49-45 loss to Miami in the Orange Bowl _ a loss that
cost them the Fiesta Bowl and cost the Pac-10 $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA locker room was not a pleasant place Saturday
afternoon. The offense blamed the defense, which yielded a
school-record 689 yards. Several players questioned the severity of
linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo's knee injury. (It's a ligament
sprain and he's expected back for the Rose Bowl.) Other players
questioned the attitude and preparation tactics of the young
defensive backs, whose tackling wasn't fit for Pop Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we make the tackles we're supposed to, it would have been
different,'' said safety Larry Atkins, one of the few defenders who
played tough and hard. ``We'll use this as something to motivate us
for the Rose Bowl. (Miami) drove up and down the field on us. We
can't let that happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Rifts between offense and defense can destroy a team; just ask
Buddy Ryan. Are the Bruins heading that way? Yes, there was tension
in the locker room, but it appears temporal, and it's up to the
captains and coach Bob Toledo to keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, the Bruins have been tempting the football fates all
season. You don't win national titles with a defense ranked 91st in
the nation. Deep down, Toledo knows it. But he also knows Cade
McNown is a once-in-a-decade quarterback, and he didn't want to
waste the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The defense should be solid next season. All the offensive skill
players will be back, including Freddie Mitchell. But a new
quarterback (presumably Drew Bennett) makes the equation tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Talent alone doesn't win championships; complementary talent
does. There has to be balance, but UCLA's scale tipped severely to
offense. Not only did the Bruins have two senior starters on
defense, they had two junior starters, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a stat that the worst defense a national-championship
team had was about 40th,'' guard Andy Meyers said. ``We beat that
by 50. You guys (the media) were right. Obviously, we were holding
onto something we couldn't obtain.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources said a slew of players _ freshman safety Jason Stephens,
sophomore cornerback Marques Anderson and junior cornerback Ryan
Roques in particular _ took a nonchalant attitude after watching
Syracuse defeat Miami 66-13 last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And privately, several Bruins are wondering if Toledo will fire
first-year defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti. Toledo himself
sparked the speculation when he ripped Aliotti at a press
conference last month, and his ire was obvious Saturday afternoon.
Aliotti deserves another year. He's a good coach with a good system
and a young defense. Not only are there two senior and two junior
starters, but many of the top reserves are first- and second-year
players.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive breakdowns against Stanford and Oregon State were
Aliotti's fault _ too much man-to-man, too many complicated
packages, substitution chaos _ but Saturday's debacle was not. It
was about effort and attitude, or lack thereof.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By electing James P. Hoffa its president, the
Teamsters union showed that it was willing to re-embrace the Hoffa
name. Now the question for the rest of the labor movement is
whether it is ready to do so as well.
</P>
<P>
   While publicly, at least, labor leaders on Sunday hailed Hoffa's
victory and pledged to work with him, leaders and rank-and-file
alike remember his father's mob ties and fear that Hoffa will allow
corruption to flourish again in the Teamsters, setting back the
whole labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   But many experts say that Hoffa's potential upside may be as big
as his potential downside, noting that if the man with the most
famous last name in labor proves to be an honest, dynamic leader as
promised, he will give the movement a much-needed shot in the arm.
</P>
<P>
   While Hoffa's path remains unclear, one thing is certain:
overnight he has become one of labor's two most prominent
spokesmen, sharing the spotlight with _ some would say stealing it
from _ the AFL-CIO's president, John J. Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa captured the presidency on Saturday when his main
opponent, Tom Leedham, conceded defeat. In declaring victory Sunday
on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press,'' Hoffa said it was time
to get past the legacy of his father, James Riddle Hoffa, who led
the union from 1957 to 1971, and who disappeared in 1975 after
being released from prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 1998,'' Hoffa said. ``People want to start over.''
</P>
<P>
   Some labor experts say that friction could develop between Hoffa
and Sweeney and other AFL-CIO leaders over some of the old-style
union barons who were key to his victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be some uneasiness in the relationship between
Hoffa and the AFL-CIO leadership,'' said Richard Hurd, a professor
of labor relations at Cornell University. ``The AFL-CIO's leaders
came into power talking about the need to change very dramatically
from the past, and to some people Hoffa represents the old way of
doing things.''
</P>
<P>
   One issue that may prove divisive is labor's involvement in
politics. Hoffa has repeatedly criticized his predecessor, Ron
Carey, and the Sweeney-led AFL-CIO for overwhelmingly backing
Democrats. He has said that the Teamsters will make sure to support
labor-friendly Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be bipartisan,'' Hoffa said on ``Meet the
Press.'' ``We're going to try to find people on both sides of the
aisle who support our agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Some labor experts say this new political tilt stems partly from
the fact that Hoffa's father was hounded by the Democratic
Kennedys, while it was a Republican, President Richard M. Nixon,
who eventually commuted his father's prison sentence after he was
convicted of fraud and jury tampering.
</P>
<P>
   But some of Sweeney's allies say that Hoffa's strategy is
essentially the same as that of the AFL-CIO, which in the past year
has moved away from reflexively backing only Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``His approach and the federation's aren't all that different,''
said Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees. ``Our union and the federation are
not captive to the Democratic Party. This year we supported more
Republicans than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, a Detroit labor lawyer, takes over the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, one of the nation's most powerful unions,
after it has floundered for more than a year, ever since Carey, the
previous president, was sidelined by a campaign-finance scandal.
Hoffa promises to make the 1.4 million-member union a powerful
player again, vowing that it will throw its weight around in
politics, organizing and contract talks.
</P>
<P>
   Many union leaders may be uneasy about his last name and the
baggage it carries, but they say it is important for all of labor
that the Teamsters are no longer leaderless or rudderless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has the potential to be a great leader,'' Sweeney
said in an interview Sunday. ``I think that the most important part
of all this is that a very strong union that has a long, rich
history has finally got a leader again.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago there were bitter tensions between Sweeney and Hoffa,
but union officials say they have largely patched up their
differences. The tensions stem from 1996, when Sweeney, Richard
Trumka, the federation's secretary-treasurer, and some allies
heading powerful unions not so subtly backed their friend, Carey,
over Hoffa in the 1996 Teamsters race. Carey, who was instrumental
in helping Sweeney gain the AFL-CIO's helm, won that race but the
victory was overturned and he was expelled from the Teamsters
because three aides had steered union money to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa said Sunday that it would be a ``challenge'' to get along
with Sweeney. ``You know the AFL-CIO interfered in our elections on
behalf of Carey,'' he said. ``Nevertheless, we are willing to turn
the page on that.''
</P>
<P>
   But another possible source of new tensions is that, in the view
of many Sweeney supporters, Hoffa and some of his allies typify
old-style, top-down unionism. Sweeney, Carey and other Sweeney
backers have embraced a bottom-up style that emphasizes
rank-and-file participation as a way to increase a union's power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the reaction is, there they go again, the Teamsters
are doing their old thing,'' said Michael Belzer, a professor of
labor relations at the University of Michigan and former truck
driver who used to support Carey. ``For those who support the new
bottom-up approach that Sweeney is pushing, Hoffa doesn't represent
a hopeful sign.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hoffa's supporters say his critics misread him, noting that
he promises to unite the members and involve the rank and file
more.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the biggest concern that many labor leaders have about
Hoffa _ one they do not want to discuss publicly _ is his ties to
some questionable figures.
</P>
<P>
   One of Hoffa's closest allies is Larry Brennan, the powerful
head of the Teamsters in Michigan. He had a major hand in running a
union welfare fund, which federal officials criticized for
misappropriating $725,000. And a federal monitor criticized Brennan
for giving his subordinates $30,000 in raises and then having them
funnel that money into his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa received some bad news this weekend when a court-appointed
review board charged Tom O'Donnell, a New York Teamster running for
vice president on the Hoffa slate, with filing false campaign
finance reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent Review Board asserted that O'Donnell, who heads
a local of movie truck drivers, failed to disclose that the Hoffa
campaign was paying an aide, Kevin Currie, who was a convicted
felon. To hide Currie's role, the reports stated that the Hoffa
treasury was paying Currie's wife, who did not work in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell could be suspended or expelled as a result of these
charges. He could not be reached for comment Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa's critics say he must have known about the falsehoods
regarding Currie, but a Hoffa spokesman denied that he had any
knowledge of it.
</P>
<P>
   But Hurd said he doubted that the allegations of Mr. Hoffa's
ties to unsavory characters would stop other union leaders from
cooperating with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think most labor leaders are going to lose any
sleep over Jimmy Hoffa's connections with organized crime,''
Professor Hurd said. ``Labor leaders have proved amazingly adept at
avoiding these kinds of issues so that they can work together when
they want.''

OUTLOOK FOR AD SPENDING; ROSTER CHANGES

   Media Executive Bullish on Spending
</P>
<P>
   Fears that economic turmoil in Asia, Brazil and Russia may cause
an advertising spending recession in 1999 are ``well overdone,''
according to the head of a leading media services agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message from our worldwide network is clear: Advertisers
feel good about the future,'' said John Perriss, chairman and chief
executive at Zenith Media Worldwide in London, a joint venture of
Cordiant Communications Group PLC and Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC.
Perriss is to discuss his predictions Monday morning at the opening
session of the annual Paine Webber media conference in midtown
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Though worldwide ad spending in 1998 will show the slowest rate
of increase since the recession early this decade, Perriss said in
remarks prepared for the conference, growth will accelerate in
1999, 2000 and 2001. He attributed the expected gains to stronger
spending by advertisers in Western Europe and North America as well
as improvement in Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   Expanded Roles For 2 Agencies
</P>
<P>
   Two big advertisers have expanded relationships with agencies on
their rosters.
</P>
<P>
   Brown-Forman Beverages Worldwide awarded the Martin Agency in
Richmond, Va., a unit of Interpublic Group of Companies, the
creative duties for Southern Comfort liqueur, Canadian Mist whiskey
and Early Times bourbon. Billings were estimated at more than $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Comfort and Canadian Mist had been handled for six
years by another Interpublic unit _ Hill, Holliday/Altschiller _
which is the New York office of the Boston agency Hill, Holliday,
Connors, Cosmopulos. The decision, which came without a review,
removes that agency from the Brown-Forman Beverages roster. Early
Times had been handled by various agencies on a project basis.
</P>
<P>
   Martin joined the Brown-Forman Beverages roster in May 1997 with
the creative assignment for Finlandia vodka. ``We're pleased with
the work for Finlandia and the results in the marketplace,'' said
Jack Kennard, senior vice president and executive director for
global brand development at Brown-Forman Beverages in Louisville,
Ky., ``and we're enthusiastic about asking Martin to take on these
additional brands.'' Media services for the brands remain at
Advanswers in St. Louis, a unit of Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   In the other change, Georgia-Pacific Corp. named the New York
office of the Minneapolis agency Fallon McElligott to handle
advertising for consumer paper product brands like Angel Soft,
Coronet, MD and Sparkle. Recent spending for those brands of
bathroom tissue, napkins and paper towels has run about $13.5
million annually.
</P>
<P>
   The brands had been handled since March by BBDO South in
Atlanta, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of Omnicom, which will
retain the Georgia-Pacific corporate image advertising account. The
Fallon McElligott New York office joined the Georgia-Pacific roster
in June with a branding assignment for the company's packaged
products group.
</P>
<P>
   ACCOUNTS: Cantisano Foods Inc., Fairport, N.Y., has chosen
Greenstone Roberts Advertising, Melville, N.Y., to handle
advertising for Franesco Rinaldi pasta sauces, which had been
handled by Vito Catalano Inc., New York, which closed. Vito
Catalano, who headed that agency, recently joined Greenstone
Roberts as senior vice president. Billings were estimated at more
than $7 million.

NEW YORK COUNCIL MEMBERS TAKING STEPS TOWARD DEFYING MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saying it was their duty to defy the mayor, a group
of City Council members vowed Sunday to commit an act of civil
disobedience Monday morning: They will hold a news conference on
the steps of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The steps have been off limits since the police ordered new
security guidelines that have blocked almost all access to the
building. Councilwoman Ronnie Eldridge said that she and about a
dozen colleagues decided last week to fight the security measures,
which have been in effect since the United States launched missiles
at suspected terrorist targets in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find it really unacceptable that people are not able to get
into this little building that has nothing in it except a bunch of
politicians,'' said Eldridge, a Democrat. ``We just want a little
bit of freedom around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said he was helping Eldridge and other council
members draft legislation to ease the security measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislative branch is supposed to make the law and the
executive branch is supposed to implement it,'' Siegel said. ``So
it's the council that should be deciding the matter of access to
the steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, said
the police would have to decide how to respond to the news
conference, since it was their job to enforce security measures.
The police declined to comment. But Roche warned that the council
could not change the security measures because under the City
Charter, that job belongs to the mayor and the police commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are suggesting exceeds the scope of their authority
as legislators,'' she said. ``Because security is always in the
purview of the executive branch of government.''
</P>
<P>
   But Siegel said that the security measures were illegal, because
they had prevented at least some people from attending council
hearings and meetings. If the police stop the council members' news
conference, he said, the members will ask a federal judge to
intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said the news conference was ``just the beginning of a
multilevel strategy to regain access to City Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Eldridge said she and other council members started plotting
their rebellion last week, after a federal appeals court ruled that
an AIDS service agency could hold a rally in the parking area in
front of City Hall. The group, Housing Works, held the rally on
Tuesday, but the police corralled the 200 demonstrators into metal
pens, a move that Eldridge described as ``ridiculous.''

GYO FUJIKAWA, 90, CREATOR OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gyo Fujikawa, a prolific author and illustrator of
children's books, including some of the first to feature children
of many races, died on Nov. 26 at New York Hospital. She was 90 and
lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The California-born daughter of a Japanese farmer and an
aspiring Japanese social worker, Miss Fujikawa was among the first
illustrators to command royalties rather than a flat fee.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Fujikawa's father borrowed her first name from a Chinese
emperor (the name rhymes with Leo).
</P>
<P>
   She illustrated five books, including ``Mother Goose'' and ``The
Night Before Christmas,'' and wrote and illustrated 45 others. She
also designed six U.S. postage stamps, including the 32-cent yellow
rose self-adhesive stamp issued last year and the United
States-Japan Treaty centenary stamp of 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Although she retired from writing and illustrating books in
1990, when her last two books were published, Barnes and Noble
booksellers had recently approached her longtime literary agent
about reprinting many of the ones that are out of print, said the
agent, Bernard Kurman. The first two books she both wrote and
illustrated, ``Babies'' and ``Baby Animals,'' have sold a combined
1.3 million copies and are still in print.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you notice,'' Miss Fujikawa wrote a few years ago, ``in all
my books (except for the fairy-tale books) there are very few
grown-ups. I try to draw children in such a way that they convey
the emotion or the action or whatever it is that I'm talking
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Berkeley, Calif., in 1908, Miss Fujikawa studied at the
Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles before and after spending
1932 in Japan, where she developed a love of Japanese art and a
stronger appreciation of her heritage. Back home, she did
promotional work on the movie ``Fantasia'' for Disney Studios,
which later sent her to its advertising department in New York,
where she designed many 25-cent Disney books.
</P>
<P>
   After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II,
Mrs. Fujikawa's family was interned in Arkansas in a relocation
camp.
</P>
<P>
   During the war Miss Fujikawa did movie and pharmaceutical
advertising layouts and magazine illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   After she did a composite of Disney characters for McCall's
magazine, Doris Dunewald, an editor at Grosset &AMP; Dunlap, asked her
to illustrate a new edition of Robert Louis Stevenson's ``A Child's
Garden of Verses,'' which was published in 1953. A few years later
Ms. Dunewald proposed that she write the text as well as illustrate
the two books that became ``Babies'' and ``Baby Animals.'' After
that Miss Fujikawa was to write and illustrate most of her books,
including the last two, ``See What I Can Be!'' (Putnam, 1990) and
``Good Night, Sleep Tight, Shhh. . .'' (Random House, 1990).
</P>
<P>
   Although she was engaged for a few years beginning at the age of
19, Miss Fujikawa never married. In her autobiographical sketch,
written in her later years, she said, ``I am flattered when people
ask me how I know so much about how children think and feel.
Although I have never had children of my own, and cannot say I had
a particularly marvelous childhood, perhaps I can say I am still
like a child myself. Part of me, I guess, never grew up.''

MAKING A CASE FOR INFERTILITY COVERAGE BY INSURERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mass.)  (js) 
 By JANE GROSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAHOPAC, N.Y. _ On Thursday morning, after a fitful night's
sleep, Rochelle Saks had her last artificial insemination. Her
medical plan does not cover infertility treatments, she owes her
doctor almost $10,000 and she can afford to pay only a few hundred
dollars a month to retire the debt. Thus, he has refused to
continue treating her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been up since 2:30 in the morning, thinking this is our
last try,'' Ms. Saks said before that final visit to the doctor.
``We cannot afford to go any further on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   But a bold decision to sue her employer could turn the tide for
Ms. Saks and others like her. She is among a small but growing band
of plaintiffs who have filed class action complaints with the
Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, charging that
denying medical coverage for infertility treatments is unlawful
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The argument for coverage, closely watched by the estimated 6
million infertile couples in the United States, was bolstered by a
Supreme Court ruling in June, not directly related to infertility,
that declared that reproduction was ``a major life activity'' and
that, therefore, those who could not procreate were protected under
the Americans With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   That decision has led to an increase in such complaints to the
commission and ``sends a clear message to employers'' that denial
of infertility coverage will come under new scrutiny, said a lawyer
with the commission who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The
complaints could lead to settlements brokered by the commission or
wind up in U.S. Court, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act or
the newer Americans With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have a leg to stand on,'' said Mark Sokoloff, one of
Ms. Saks' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of requiring coverage of infertility treatments is
fiercely contested by insurance company advocates, business groups
and some academics.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Saks, 37, is an unlikely standard-bearer, a soft-spoken
store manager who until recently discussed her quest for a child
only with her closest friends and relatives. But she said she was
galled by what she called the hypocrisy of her employer, Franklin
Covey Co., which sells motivational books and educational materials
based on the Mormon principals of its owners, who say that family
is their No. 1 priority.
</P>
<P>
   One of those books, ``The Seven Habits of Highly Effective
Families,'' by Stephen Covey, sits on the coffee table in the
Sakses' modest town house in this Putnam County village. The book
is dedicated to ``all children, our common mission'' and begins
with the author's unqualified assertion that ``family is what I
care the most about.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Franklin Covey store that Ms. Saks manages in White
Plains, the shelves are filled with parenting guides. And at
company management conferences, there are frequent discussions of
policies to help employees balance work and family.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ms. Saks and her husband, Joel, a salesman of hair products,
said they received no support from company executives during their
wrangle with the insurance company that administers the Covey
medical plan. That plan explicitly excludes coverage for ``surgical
impregnation procedures,'' including artificial insemination and in
vitro fertilization, and for injectable drugs that assist in
conception. It also excludes coverage for ``complications arising
from noncovered surgery,'' a footnote that would haunt the Sakses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Saks, an employee of the company since 1995, began treatment
for hormonal imbalance and infertility in June 1997, using a
physician approved by the plan. She was prescribed a standard
regimen of oral medication and was artificially inseminated with
her husband's sperm.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Ms. Saks became pregnant, but miscarried a month
later. Virtually all her medical claims were denied by the insurer,
including those related to her miscarriage, which was deemed a
``byproduct of an uncovered procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Saks appealed the plan's denial of coverage and spent many
months fighting over medical bills, which then totaled about
$9,500. Two months ago, Ms. Saks was informed that $1,458 worth of
services rendered between her positive pregnancy test and her
miscarriage would be covered. But beyond that one month of care,
her appeals were denied.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Saks remained optimistic that the company's
family-centered ethos would prevail if she brought her dilemma to
someone's attention. Among the many letters she sent was one to
Sean Covey, the company's vice president. ``I would hope that a
company that puts so much emphasis and value in family would see
the need to help its employees achieve what matters most,'' Ms.
Saks wrote.
</P>
<P>
   That letter, and many others, went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was shocking,'' Saks said of the company's silence. ``We
thought they practiced what they preached.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, with the help of Resolve, an advocacy organization
for infertile couples, Ms. Saks was put in touch with two New City
law firms that were willing to take her case free of charge. Ms.
Saks' complaint was filed late in October by the Jacob D. Fuchsberg
Law Firm and the firm of Bernstein Litowitz Berger &AMP; Grossmann ,
and the EEOC notified Franklin Covey of the action. Several calls
last week to Franklin Covey's corporate headquarters in Salt Lake
City seeking comment went unanswered.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A second equal-opportunity complaint, also organized by Resolve,
has been filed on behalf of a couple denied infertility treatment
by the Long Island Rail Road. The second couple was not willing to
be interviewed or identified. According to Resolve, the railroad
paid for a procedure to remove sperm from the man, who has
fertility problems. But the second half of the procedure, the
injection of sperm into his wife, was not covered because the
woman, also a railroad employee, is healthy.
</P>
<P>
   While complaints of this kind are just now gaining ground in New
York, they have already succeeded in Chicago. A police officer
there won a $1.5 million class action settlement last year from the
city for coverage of infertility treatment. And several other
complaints to the EEOC have recently been settled, including one
against a suburban police department and another against a
consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these recent victories for infertile couples, there is
ample disagreement about whether insurance coverage for assisted
reproduction is realistic, or required under the law.
</P>
<P>
   George Annas, the chairman of the health law department at the
Boston University School of Public Health, thinks that infertile
couples have a much stronger claim for time off for treatment and
other ``reasonable accommodations'' in the workplace than they do
for medical coverage, since employers have no ``affirmative
obligation'' to provide any insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law
issued a 462-page report on assisted reproductive technologies and
concluded that there is ``no persuasive reason'' for requiring
insurance coverage of infertility treatment when so many people
have no health insurance at all or have coverage that excludes
other conditions, including mental illness and dental problems.
</P>
<P>
   That report was a blow to New York state lawmakers sponsoring a
bill to mandate insurance coverage for infertility. That bill died
in a committee last year but is expected to be reintroduced, with
amendments that would put limits on the number of procedures, the
total cost and who would qualify as a patient. Two states,
Massachusetts and Illinois, already mandate infertility coverage,
but self-insured companies are exempt.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of insurance reimbursements for infertility
treatments, which are rarely covered, make an economic as well as a
moral case. A study in Massachusetts, based on actual experience,
found that the additional cost of such coverage was $1.71 a month
per member. Other studies, based on projections, put the cost at
about $3 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The current situation encourages women to have expensive and
ineffective gynecological surgery that is covered by insurance,
advocates say, rather than more appropriate and effective
procedures, including in vitro fertilization, which is generally
not covered, but has a much higher success rate. And when women do
choose in vitro procedures without insurance, they are more likely
to implant many embryos to increase the odds that the expensive
procedure will succeed. But that also raises the odds of highly
expensive and dangerous multiple births.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of insurance coverage dominates the agenda of Resolve,
the advocacy group, which continues to recruit potential plaintiffs
for legal action, even as it lobbies lawmakers in Albany for a
state mandate. On Thursday, at Resolve's annual holiday party, Ms.
Saks received a rousing ovation for filing her complaint.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged the applause from the safe circle of her
mother-in-law's embrace, her cheeks streaked with tears and
mascara. Ms. Saks was clearly debilitated from a long day that
began in the doctor's office. But she spoke optimistically about
the artificial insemination.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time I was on a lot more drugs and I responded well,''
said Ms. Saks, who will learn in a few weeks whether the procedure
was successful.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Sokoloff, and Resolve's executive director, Pamela
Madsen, prowled the room where the party guests included some of
New York's leading infertility doctors. They were searching for
someone who would take Ms. Saks as a patient, despite her inability
to pay.
</P>
<P>
   But by Friday morning, that hope had evaporated. ``As of now,
there's no new doctor,'' Ms. Madsen said. ``She's cut off. That's
it.''

TAYLOR GIVES ROBINSON A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Kings have lost 11 of their past 12
games, but general manager Dave Taylor said Sunday the solution is
not to replace coach Larry Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry is our coach, period,'' Taylor said after Sunday's
practice at the Forum. ``He and I are going to work together to try
to get this situation resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the contract extension offered to Robinson during
training camp _ an extension he chose not to sign at the time _
Taylor said: ``We're talking about it. We've agreed to table it.
The priority is to get the team turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, in his fourth year as Kings coach, is in the final
year of his contract. Of his decision to wait to sign the
extension, Robinson said: ``I've chosen not to do anything. It
doesn't mean I don't want it. I just didn't want to address it now.
If I didn't have confidence in my ability and was afraid of losing
my job, I probably would have jumped on it right away.''
</P>
<P>
   When the extension was offered, job insecurity for Robinson was
a non-issue, because he was coming off a season in which he'd been
a finalist for Coach of the Year honors. Two months later, the
Kings (6-17-3) have the worst record in the NHL. The Kings' next
game is Wednesday night against Washington at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time in Robinson's three-plus years as Kings
coach that his long-term future has been in doubt, the other
occasion coming late in his second season.
</P>
<P>
   On April 22, 1997, the day Taylor was promoted to his current
position, the Kings also announced that Robinson had agreed to
remain with the Kings for the final two years of his original
four-year contract. Robinson had wanted his contract renegotiated
to include an escape clause after last season, but Taylor said at
the time Robinson would remain despite not getting that clause.
</P>
<P>
   As for the current state of the Kings, Taylor said: ``You have
to look at the big picture. We went through a series of very tough
injuries and a very tough schedule.... Working together is how
we're going to turn this around _ Larry, his staff, myself and the
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Spreading blame: After Saturday's 4-3 loss to Detroit, Robinson
said defenseman Steve Duchesne had committed a ``cardinal sin'' by
abandoning the front of the net to chase forward Doug Brown to the
left boards on the play that resulted in the Red Wings' winning
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a play like this, if you blame a certain person... come in
and tell me in person,'' Duchesne said Sunday when asked about
Robinson's critique. ``Don't go in the paper and say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson softened his position Sunday, saying Duchesne was just
one of a number of players guilty of making mistakes on the goal
that cost the Kings the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen the play (on videotape),'' Robinson said. ``I was
a lot harder on (Duchesne) than I should have been. Having seen the
play, he wasn't the biggest culprit.''

GEORGE VAN EPS, 85, MUSICIAN WHO POPULARIZED 7-STRING GUITAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Van Eps, a guitarist who played with some of the biggest
names in jazz and pioneered the seven-string guitar, died on Nov.
29 at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach, Calif.
He was 85 and lived in Huntington Beach , Calif.
</P>
<P>
   His family said the cause was pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-string guitar, which Van Eps helped popularize,
allowed him to use his harmonic imagination. The seventh string,
added in the bass, gave him the ability to play more orchestrally,
adding bass lines below the chord, and making the guitar a more
convincing solo instrument. Van Eps referred to the guitar as his
lap piano.
</P>
<P>
   Though his career started early in jazz history, his quiet
sophistication never received the attention received by the
guitarists Django Reinhardt, Charlie Christian and their followers.
But he did have several important students, including the
guitarists Ron Eschete, from Louisiana, and Howard Alden and Bucky
Pizzarelli, from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Van Eps came from a musical family, with his mother, father and
brothers all playing; George Gershwin was a regular guest in the
house. He began professionally at the age of 11 in New Jersey and
he performed for six months with an early idol, the guitarist Eddie
Lang, in the Smith Ballew band.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1930s, Van Eps worked with Freddy Martin, Benny
Goodman and Ray Noble.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938 Van Eps, who had recently moved to California, went to
the Epiphone guitar company to broaden the palette of his
instrument, adding the seventh string.
</P>
<P>
   He then spent much of the next several decades working in
recording studios, in part for the 1950s film and television series
``Pete Kelly's Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   He recorded occasionally for Capitol records during the 1960s;
in the 1970s an illness, and an accident that injured his hand,
took him off the music scene for a while.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1990s he surfaced with a series of fine records for
Concord Jazz, recording with Alden, and an album with the guitarist
Johnny Smith.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Kay Van Eps of Huntington Beach.

NATIONAL TITLE BOWL IS HERE, AND SO IS PLAYOFF TALK
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It took a dramatic Saturday of upsets that left just one major
team unbeaten, but the inaugural Bowl Championship Series fulfilled
its mission of bringing a clear-cut title game to college football
Sunday when it matched the undefeated Tennessee Volunteers and the
once-beaten but surging Florida State Seminoles in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one is happy.
</P>
<P>
   Not the coaches, Phillip Fulmer of Tennessee and Bobby Bowden of
Florida State, who will play in the primetime Jan. 4 title tilt in
Tempe, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Not Ohio State Coach John Cooper, whose Buckeyes (10-1) are in
the Sugar Bowl but have no shot for the title. And especially not
the faithful fans of Kansas State (11-1), who are still upset that
their Wildcats were one successful play from the Fiesta Bowl but
are now locked out of the BCS bowls, and a $12 million payday, and
are on their way instead to San Antonio and a date with Purdue
(8-4) in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 29.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, on the day the major bowl matchups were announced amid
nationally televised fanfare, college football's coaches renewed
their cry for a playoff system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennessee came in through the front door,'' said Bowden, whose
Seminoles (10-1) leaped over UCLA and Kansas State, both losers of
thrilling games on Saturday, to get a shot at the title. ``We came
in the back door. Now we're going to face them in the middle of the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, who said he has been an opponent of a playoff, added:
``I've had a feeling in the last two weeks we re getting closer to
a playoff because I heard so many scenarios. There are some other
teams that maybe deserve this more than us. I think maybe we should
have a four-team playoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's Fulmer, who has the only undefeated team in the top
five of the B.C.S. ranking, indicated that the new system was
fortunate this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that there should be a playoff at some point,''
Fulmer said. ``It worked itself out this year, and it's better than
it has been in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State's Cooper was more pointed in his call for a playoff.
``I think I can make the argument we are one of the top two teams
in the country,'' said Cooper, whose 10-1 Buckeyes lost to Michigan
State late in the season. ``We were No. 1 for nine weeks.'' The
Buckeyes will go to New Orleans to play Texas A&AMP;M (11-2), which
opened the door to the Fiesta Bowl for Florida State with a 36-33
double-overtime victory over Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't bother me to see the top eight teams go play it
out,'' Cooper said. ``It wouldn't bother me to have a one-game
playoff after this bowl game is over.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one was more irate than Kansas State University President
Jon Wefald, who saw his school's only defeat, in perhaps the best
college football game of the year, knock it out of the limelight
despite a No. 3 ranking in the final B.C.S. standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we go from being 1 point away, one play away, from
playing Tennessee for the national championship, to playing Purdue
in the Alamo Bowl?'' Wefald said to The Associated Press. ``I guess
the BCS rankings only mean something for the top two teams. That's
not right. That's something they have to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, organizers of the ranking system, which was intended to
identify the top two teams in the country and make sure they played
each other for the national championship, insisted they did their
job.
</P>
<P>
   The complicated BCS formula, which took into account the
Associated Press news media poll and USA Today/ESPN coaches poll,
three computer rankings including that of The New York Times, and
teams' strength of schedule, came up with two teams everyone agreed
on. Tennessee was the top pick in the news media and coaches polls
and Florida State, which the BCS formula determined played the
nation's fourth-toughest schedule, was the consensus No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The computer rankings _ including the one by The New York Times,
which had Florida State ahead of Tennessee _ concurred on the top
two teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any question about it,'' said the BCS
chairman, Roy Kramer. ``Florida State deserves to be there.
Tennessee deserves to be there on all the criteria we used. That's
all we were trying to do is establish the 1-2 game. The other
selections are up to individual bowls.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is what banished Kansas State to a minor bowl. The Rose
Bowl retained its traditional flavor and matched the Big 10 and
Pacific-10 champions, Wisconsin and UCLA. The Orange Bowl, which
had to invite Syracuse (8-3) as champion of the Big East, then
exercised its freedom of choice and snubbed Kansas State to invite
Florida (9-2). The Orange Bowl's executive director, Keith Tribble,
conceded economics were the reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in our best interests to put the game that was best for
us together,'' Tribble said. ``It's strictly up to the bowls what
is in our best interests in putting together a good matchup that
has fan interest.'' The Orange Bowl opted for a Florida team that
has not been to the Miami-based bowl since 1967, when Gator Coach
Steve Spurrier was quarterback, to offset what it believed would be
modest ticket sales from Syracuse fans.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier, a playoff proponent who is hardly known for
compassion, was the first to offer empathy for Kansas State fans.
``I feel really sad for Kansas State,'' he said. ``That game was
the biggest thing in their school history and now they're up there
with not much of anything but a bowl trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's Bowden, who had to wait while first UCLA and
then Kansas State lost on Saturday to give his team the trip to
Tempe, seemed befuddled by his good fortune. ``I've never
accomplished so much doing nothing and just sitting on the couch,''
he said.

CLINTON LAWYERS GET TWO DAYS TO PRESENT DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's lawyers braced Sunday for their
last stand before the House Judiciary Committee, as top lawmakers
in both parties said the full House is poised to send at least one
impeachment charge to the Senate for a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Just weeks after the House appeared certain to reject articles
of impeachment, Clinton's legal team Tuesday is scheduled to launch
a last-ditch, 30-hour marathon presentation aimed at staving off
the first Senate trial of a sitting president in 130 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee, in a letter Sunday to Clinton's
lawyers, said the White House can make its final arguments to the
panel Tuesday and Wednesday, from 9 a.m. to midnight each day.
</P>
<P>
   As the prospects also seemed to dim for alternatives to a House
vote on impeachment, Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Lowell
Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said Clinton must act urgently
to salvage the compromise initiative. The panel is expected to
approve at least one impeachment charge against Clinton by the end
of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Support for an alternative to impeachment appears to have
eroded, as GOP moderates and some Democrats criticized Clinton's
legalistic response last month to 81 questions from the committee
asking him to admit numerous details stemming from his sexual
affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has acknowledged misleading people about the
relationship, he has denied allegations by the independent counsel,
Kenneth W. Starr, that he committed 11 impeachable offenses in
trying to cover up the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Clinton's supporters have begun warning him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critical that the White House recognize the fact that the
president needs to admit that his conduct was unacceptable and that
he was wrong,'' Meehan said in an interview. ``He needs to come to
terms with the fact that there needs to be some kind of punishment
short of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet several lawmakers indicated on television news shows Sunday
that the opportunity may already have passed to exert enough
pressure on House leaders to permit a vote on an alternative short
of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The House majority whip, Tom DeLay of Texas, ruled out the
possibility of a vote on a compromise plan and said, ``If we voted
Monday, the president would be impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Representative John Conyers Jr., the ranking Democrat
on the Judiciary Committee, said he will continue to fight for a
compromise, he charged that House Republicans are waging a
``psychopathic'' effort to remove Clinton from office. Conyers said
the full House is ``quite likely'' to approve at least one article
of impeachment as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   If impeachment charges pass the House, Senate majority leader
Trent Lott said, the Senate would move ``very briskly'' toward a
trial even though it appears extremely unlikely that supporters of
Clinton's ouster could muster the 67 votes they would need to
remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he hoped the inquiry would be much shorter than the
three-month trial of President Andrew Johnson in 1868, the only
other presidential impeachment trial in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see it lasting just a few days to a few weeks,'' Lott
said.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee plans to begin debating several
impeachment charges on Thursday, after presentations from the White
House and the chief investigators for both parties on the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers had sought four days to present Clinton's
case. But the committee, in altering its original plan for a
one-day presentation by the president's legal team, accused the
White House of creating the problem by flouting the panel's
deadline for scheduling the final argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, you have failed to comply with the committee's
procedures and demonstrated contempt for the committee's process,''
the panel's chief of staff, Thomas E. Mooney, wrote to the White
House lawyers, Charles F.C. Ruff and Gregory B. Craig. ``I am
concerned that your recent maneuvers may be little more than an
attempt to delay the committee and turn attention away from the
facts.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee gave Clinton's lawyers until noon Monday to
propose the witnesses they want to call.
</P>
<P>
   The White House responded with disdain and resignation. ``The
independent counsel spent four years and $40 million investigating
the president,'' said James F. Kennedy, special adviser to the
White House counsel. ``The committee is spending four months doing
the same. Our request for just four days has now been cut in half.
Nevertheless, we will work to defend the president despite these
restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said Clinton's lawyers were developing a list of
prospective witnesses to deliver to the committee Monday. As of
late Sunday, he said, the White House had settled on only three:
Nicholas Katzenbach, an attorney general under President Lyndon B.
Johnson; Bruce Ackerman, a Yale law professor; and Sean Wilentz, a
Princeton history professor.
</P>
<P>
   They are expected to argue that Clinton's misdeeds do not meet
the standards for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet several committee Republicans said they expect the panel to
approve at least one count of perjury and possibly charges of
obstruction of justice and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   The perjury charge, which will allege that Clinton lied under
oath to a federal grand jury investigating the Lewinsky matter, is
seen as most likely to pass the full House.

USC TO FACE TCU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   USC's anticipated rematch with Purdue suddenly didn't look so
bad Sunday, when the Sun Bowl voted to select Texas Christian as
the Trojans' opponent for the Dec.31 bowl game in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Christian became USC's opponent after Ohio State was
selected by the BCS on Sunday, meaning Purdue moved up a notch and
will play in the Alamo Bowl. Earlier this week, Purdue had accepted
an invitation to the Sun Bowl, but UCLA and Kansas State's losses
Saturday shook up the BCS bowl pairings.
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs (6-5, 4-4) are a less-than-exhilarating choice,
considering they are unranked and barely qualified for a bowl game
by defeating 0-11 Nevada-Las Vegas in their season finale.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Bowl executive director John Folmer said Sunday that Texas
Christian was selected over Central Florida. Colorado State,
Wyoming and Miami of Ohio were also last-minute considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Folmer had negotiated Saturday with the Southeastern Conference
to take Alabama, Georgia or Arkansas, but said that plan fell
through when Florida was taken by the BCS to play in the Orange
Bowl. That meant the SEC had no extra teams to send to bowls after
filling its contractual agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several of those SEC teams wanted to play USC,'' Folmer said.
``We were held hostage by the BCS and the Big Ten. Unfortunately,
this system has flaws. It was not very much fun Saturday. We had a
wacky last 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU was favored by the Sun Bowl because it is expected to bring
a sizable contingent to the game, and because coach Dennis
Franchione is well-known in El Paso after coaching at nearby New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's two up-and-coming teams,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said.
``It wasn't a matter of who we were going to play. We're just
delighted to keep playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our programs are similar. We were both down a little bit. I
just don't want it to be too much of a home game with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs are led by All-WAC linebacker Joseph Phipps,
who has 152 tackles and 5.5 sacks. Their top offensive player is
tailback Basil Mitchell, who gained more than 1,000 yards this
season.

NORTHEAST'S GOP MODERATES PRESSURED ON IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.J.)  (rl) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen of Morristown, N.J., is
just the kind of Republican the Clinton administration thinks it
can deal with: a centrist with a long resume of bucking his
conservative leaders on issues like abortion, gun control and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   So it was not unusual recently for a member of President
Clinton's Cabinet, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, to phone
Frelinghuysen, who sits on an important energy subcommittee. But
Richardson was not interested in discussing nuclear reactors or oil
prices; he was calling about the main thing politicians in
Washington talk about these days, impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Frelinghuysen did not take the call. Like many Republican
moderates from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, he has been
withholding judgment, trying to keep his head low while the White
House and Republican conservatives exchange potshots over Clinton's
future.
</P>
<P>
   With articles of impeachment likely to reach the House floor by
mid-month, the Northeast moderates, the single largest group of
swing voters on this panel of 435 grand jurors, are coming under
pressure to take a stand. Almost daily, they receive telephone
calls from their leadership asking about their position and perhaps
nudging them to vote yes. Many, like Frelinghuysen, have been
contacted by White House officials or friendly Democrats looking to
see if they could support censure instead of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   All must endure an endless stream of media pundits who offer
daily predictions on what the moderates will do. It is an agonizing
15 minutes of fame that many of the moderates would rather do
without.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one hell of a mess,'' said Frelinghuysen, who has
suggested docking the president's pension as punishment, an idea
that appears to have been rejected by the House leadership. ``And
it's one we didn't even get ourselves into. The president did it
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Their anguish is not hard to understand. Many Republican
moderates from the New York metropolitan area represent districts
where voters have supported Clinton in past elections and have
expressed firm opposition to impeachment. Clinton won by large
margins in all three states in 1996, and his approval ratings are
as high in the region as anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The moderates include Rep. Nancy Johnson of New Britain, Conn.,
who cited her alliance with the president on children's health care
legislation on the stump this year. Rep. Michael Forbes of Suffolk
County on Long Island appeared with Clinton in August to promote
managed care legislation. Rep. Peter King of Nassau County, N.Y.,
traveled to Ireland with the President in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are pragmatists,'' said the chief of staff of one
moderate from the region, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``These are not people out for Clinton's blood. This is a wing of
the party that does not feel Clinton is an evil guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Rep. Christopher Shays of Stamford, Conn., put it, ``I
didn't run for Congress to spend all my time working on getting rid
of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays and King are two of five Republicans who have said that
they will vote against impeachment. A third is also from the
region: Rep. Jack Quinn of Hamburg, N.Y. Only two Republicans from
the area, Reps. Marge Roukema and Bob Franks, both from New Jersey,
have said they will probably vote for impeachment. The remaining
Republicans from the three states say they remain undecided.
</P>
<P>
   But if Clinton's supporters think the Northeastern moderates are
a lock to vote against impeachment, they are wrong. Some worry that
voting against impeachment will antagonize the conservatives who
dominate the House leadership. Others feel that a large number of
their constituents, including Democrats, want Clinton to be
punished for lying about his affair with Monica Lewinsky, though
they would prefer something less severe than impeachment. But
censure is a choice the Republican leadership is not likely to
allow, leaving a straight up-or-down vote on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Other moderates have a deep-seated anger toward the president,
whose conduct they think has insulted them and stained his office.
Several said they were particularly infuriated with Clinton for
refusing to take more responsibility for his actions when he
answered 81 questions sent to him by the House Judiciary Committee
last month.
</P>
<P>
   In what seems an effort to win over wavering moderates, the
White House has promised a vigorous defense before the judiciary
panel.
</P>
<P>
   A gnawing concern among many moderates is that supporting
impeachment could upset a scandal-weary electorate. Many of them
attribute the losses of Republican incumbents like Rep. Michael
Pappas of Rocky Hill, N.J., and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in New York
last month to voters' anger with the Republican congressional
leadership and the plethora of investigations into the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that Republicans were hurt in November by
the perception that we were focused on Lewinsky and not on issues
such as Social Security, taxes and health care,'' said King, who
has become a leading proponent of censuring the president.

<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Endeavour astronauts joined the first pieces of
the new international space station Sunday night in a seven-hour
orbital display of the right stuff and the new symbolism of
post-Cold War global cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The difficult task united large U.S. and Russian manufactured
modules, forming a single 74-foot-long, nearly 70,000-pound
structural bridge with rudimentary propulsion, electrical power
generation and ground communications. Eventually, station planners
hope, the bridge will join scientific laboratories, crew quarters
and other components from 16 different nations as the outpost grows
to the size of two football fields placed side by side.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's successful operation culminated at 8:07 p.m., CST, as
Endeavour's six astronauts soared 240 miles over the South Pacific
Ocean. A burst of the shuttle's steering thrusters nudged the
docking mechanism of the U.S module locked in Endeavour's cargo bay
into the latching assembly of the Russian module. The Russian
module was suspended inches above the American component in the
grasp of the shuttle's long robot arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have capture,'' Endeavour commander Bob Cabana informed
mission control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We congratulate the crew of the good ship Endeavour,''
responded Chris Hadfield, the shuttle crew's liaison in mission
control. ``That's terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty minutes after the capture, the two modules had been
mechanically matched together with an air-tight seal. This part of
the procedure took longer than anticipated because of a small
temporary misalignment between the two components. Once the robot
arm was released from the Russian module the misalignment
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Joined were:
</P>
<P>
   A 33-foot-long, 25,600-pound American module dubbed ``Unity''
that Endeavour lifted off with early last Friday. The $300 million
module was built for NASA by Boeing. Cylinder-shaped with a stubby
cone at each end, Unity earned its name from its half-dozen docking
ports. The ports were designed to accept the station's future U.S.
research module, airlock, an observation deck, crew quarters and
trusswork for the primary American power generation gear.
</P>
<P>
   A 41-foot-long, 42,600-pound propulsion and power production
module christened ``Zarya,'' Russian for sunrise. Zarya was
launched from Central Asia on Nov. 20 at Russian expense. As the
station's cornerstone, Zarya will generate electrical power and
furnish the propulsive maneuvers needed to keep the Earth's gravity
from pulling the two modules back to the ground. The Russian
aerospace contractor, Krunichev, received $240 million from the
United States to produce it. Eventually, Zarya's responsibilities
will be taken over by other station components and it will become a
storage facility and fuel depot.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's activities required Endeavour's crew of five Americans
and a Russian cosmonaut working with mission control teams in
Houston and suburban Moscow to rendezvous with and capture Zarya
using the shuttle's Canadian-built, 50-foot-long robot arm. The
coordination was painstaking at times, as the fliers and the ground
teams talked back and forth to ensure the docking mechanisms were
accurately aligned before the shuttle initiated the propulsive
latching procedure.
</P>
<P>
   A serious miscalculation would have caused the modules to bounce
dangerously off one another.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, and without a hitch, Cabana and pilot Rick
Sturckow executed a series of carefully timed maneuvers that
brought Endeavour beneath, in front of and finally 10 feet above
Zarya.
</P>
<P>
   Then the shuttle crew waited patiently within grasping distance
for nearly a half-hour until the two high flying spacecraft were
over the Russian ground stations that were to monitor the module's
capture.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:47 p.m., CST, and 242 miles over the border between Russia
and Kazakhstan, Endeavour astronaut Nancy Currie commanded the
55-foot-long robot arm to grab the Russian module. She accomplished
the delicate task two minutes into a 10.5 minute capture period
that expired as Russian ground stations lost contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have Zarya firmly attached to the orbiter (Endeavour),'' an
exuberant Cabana radioed mission control. ``We're halfway home for
the day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are exhaling down here,'' responded Chris
Hadfield, the shuttle crew's liaison in mission control. ``That's
great.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Currie had used the robotic arm to position Unity
atop the airlock and docking mechanism in Endeavour's cargo bay to
await the linkup with Zarya. The repositioning left the American
module jutting four stories out of the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   The towering Unity module blocked direct views of Zarya from
shuttle windows for both Cabana and Currie as the shuttle crew
conducted its risky, close-up operations with the free-flying
Russian module.
</P>
<P>
   Currie nabbed Zarya relying on closed-circuit television views
beamed from video cameras in the shuttle cargo bay and on the robot
arm. They remained her primary view over the next two hours as she
carefully raised and aligned Zarya atop Unity.
</P>
<P>
   With only inches separating the two modules, Cabana fired the
shuttle's steering thrusters forcing their respective docking
assemblies together in a mechanical clinch that neither station
partner seems likely to break.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle crew began Sunday trailing Zarya by several thousand
miles.
</P>
<P>
   The rendezvous activities were interrupted briefly early in the
day when U.S. military satellite trackers warned NASA of a
potential ``near miss'' between the shuttle and the third stage of
a commercial Delta II rocket that was launched from Vandenberg Air
Force Base, Calif., on Nov. 6 with several small communications
satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Well in advance of a potential convergence, Endeavour's crew
maneuvered to ensure a clearance of at least five miles rather than
the predicted 1.8 miles.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of an abbreviated rest period, the shuttle crew awoke
eager to tackle the most difficult phase of their 12-day mission, a
rendezvous and capture operation for which they had trained two
years. The mission was delayed a year by Russian financial
difficulties that have slowed the development of a future station
component that nonetheless paced the launchings of the first two
modules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreams do come true for all who are persistent and keep the
faith,'' Cabana noted as mission control woke up the astronauts
with ``Somewhere Over the Rainbow'' as sung by Judy Garland.
</P>
<P>
   Three lengthy spacewalks will be required to complete the task
of fully integrating Unity and Zarya.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the excursions is scheduled to begin late tonight
(Monday). Spacewalking astronauts Jerry Ross and Jim Newman plan to
scale the two joined modules, connecting nearly 40 power and
computer data cables.
</P>
<P>
   A second spacewalk is intended to establish a direct, high speed
communications link between the new station and NASA's mission
control.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the two excursions and a third later this week, the
spacewalkers will attach foot and hand holds as they proceed to
secure themselves for the hand-intensive tasks, or they will
position themselves on the end of the shuttle's robot arm ``cherry
picker'' style.
</P>
<P>
   Though tethered while they work, both men will wear a new
jetpack that would permit them to maneuver back to the shuttle if
the safety line snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, the Endeavour crew plans to make their way
through the shuttle's airlock and a succession of hatches into the
interior of Unity and Zarya. They plan to leave tools and supplies
for future shuttle construction crews and the first expedition of
cosmonauts and astronauts who are tentatively scheduled to take up
residence aboard the growing station in January 2000.
</P>
<P>
   All told, 45 assembly launches and 162 spacewalks are envisioned
to fully construct the new station over the next six years.

FORMER COUP LEADER WINS VENEZUELEAN PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: SUBS to recast lead, ADD fresh Chavez quote in 3rd graf,
update throughout.)

<P>
   CARACUS, Venezuela _ Venezuelans swept a former coup-leader,
Hugo Chavez, to a historic election victory on Sunday night,
delivering him the presidency he failed to seize by force six years
ago. Hoping for an end to decades of poverty amid oil wealth,
euphoric supporters of the former paratrooper burst onto the
streets and filled them with music, fireworks and blaring horns.
</P>
<P>
   The former lieutenant colonel, who on Sunday defeated a
Yale-educated businessman, Henrique Salas Romer, with more than 50
percent of the vote, is the first leader in 40 years who has not
come from Venezuela's dominant political parties. His meteoric
success among legions of disaffected voters smashed the old-line
party machinery and fanned fears of leftist dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are democrats, and we are going to demonstrate it now,'' he
told a television interviewer here Sunday night, smoothing over the
hostility that had marked the campaign. ``We're not tyrants. We're
not dictators.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night enthusiastic crowds, many sporting Chavez's
trademark red beret, filled a main avenue and shouted, ``Viva
Venezuela! Viva Chavez!'' They chanted demands to rewrite the 1961
Constitution, which had bolstered the rule of the elite for the
four decades of Venezuela's democracy. ``Chavez: A National
Feeling,'' declared a tall yellow banner raised to serve as the
triumphant candidate's backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   As the streets throbbed with the joy of his supporters, nobody
was really sure what Venezuela would look like under Chavez, who
has been called a nationalist, a Communist, a hero and a would-be
dictator. In the campaign, he frequently sported the red beret of
the military special forces he once led to storm the presidential
palace and called on supporters to crush ``los corruptos'' on
election day.
</P>
<P>
   A fiery orator who has visited Cuba and praised President Fidel
Castro, Chavez has become the symbol of hope through radical change
for the four out of five Venezuelans who are poor, and the
dangerous devil to the 20 percent who do not.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the announcement of his victory, Chavez
pledged to seek moderation and foster forgiveness, after a campaign
rife with disinformation, innuendo and dirty tricks. Just days ago,
at his closing rally in downtown Caracas, he had warned 700,000
supporters about the prospect they might lose the election through
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, he told his supporters to ``celebrate, but with
humility, even with silence, with reflection. It's not about
sticking your head out of the window, because tomorrow we begin
another battle'' to rebuild Venezuela, he said. He called on
Venezuelans to build ``with harmony, and with a great capacity for
forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who have made mistakes, we say, `So did we.' Let's
forgive each other our errors,'' Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   With 78 percent of the vote counted, Chavez had 56 percent
compared to 40 percent for Salas, according to official results
from the National Electoral Council.
</P>
<P>
   In conceding defeat, Salas struck a similarly conciliatory note.
``I want to say to all Venezuelans that not only do I accept my
adversary's victory, I also wish him much luck because his luck is
Venezuela's luck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chavez called on the banking and private sector to bring back
assets and investment capital sent abroad, precisely out of fear he
would win Sunday's election. Chavez offered to open talks with the
private sector, adding, ``Venezuela needs you, it needs friends.''
He told business leaders he wanted to understand ``how to interpret
your expectations, your anxieties, your aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   But initially, those appeals seemed to draw little more than
skepticism. Eric Ekvall, a political consultant here, was watching
Chavez's interview with a group of very wary business executives.
</P>
<P>
   When the president-elect called for the repatriation of capital,
``There was a whoop of derisive laughter from the group here,''
Ekvall said. The reaction, he added, ``sets the tone for how a lot
of the business community here is going to react to him in the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of massive fraud, of a post-election settling of scores,
and threats of rioting ran like rivers through the capital in the
days leading up to the election on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Though Chavez had been leading in election polls by 15 to 22
points, veteran political analysts said on Sunday night they were
still surprised that the old parties released their once-iron
fisted hold on power under the weight of the democratic will.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are historic elections,'' the American ambassador here,
John Maisto, said in an interview with reporters before the Chavez
victory. ``Nothing like these elections has happened in Venezuela's
history.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador also said Washington would ``work with any
government, no matter who is elected.'' Previously, the Clinton
administration had denied Chavez a visa, citing his role in the
attempted coup, but a State Department spokesman suggested last
week that Chavez might have better luck securing a visa next time.
The rejection, he said, ``is in the past, and the future we will
deal with at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   After trying, and failing, to seize power in two attempted coups
against Carlos Andres Perez in 1992, Chavez became a symbol for
Venezuelans impatient with corruption and misery amid vast oil
wealth. Chavez went to jail for two years, but Perez lost as well:
he was impeached to face corruption charges a year later. The
paratrooper's popularity grew.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His statements have fallen all over the political map, often
depending on his audiences, although he has generally moved toward
the center in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Educated Venezuelans doubt Chavez's devotion to democracy, while
the poor say democracy here has been little more than a cover for
institutional corruption. Venezuela is the leading exporter of oil
to the United States, and the biggest oil producing country outside
the Middle East, but 40 percent of its people live in dire poverty,
unable to afford a nourishing diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We voted Chavez because we want a change, not a
dictatorship,'' said Kurokwis Escobar, 35, who paints cars for a
living.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we need a change,'' declared Hughes Castilla
Molina, 52, who owns an auto repair shop. ``If you say we're going
to lose our liberty, I say we've lost it already. At least we'll
have a change. We'll have education, health care, and housing,
which we don't have now. That's the popular clamor.''
</P>
<P>
   From the poor hillside slums like Petare to the posh, tree-lined
streets of Altamir, Venezuelans turned out in record numbers to
vote in an election freighted with a sense of history in the
making.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-day, the number of voters at polling stations around
Caracas had exceeded the total balloting in congressional and state
elections a month ago, when Chavez's Patriotic Pole won a plurality
with a third of the legislature and eight of the 23 governorships.
</P>
<P>
   For 40 years, the two traditional parties, Democratic Action and
Copei, had shared the spoils of power in this oil-rich nation, and
by the end of voting, their long day in the sun had come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the two parties fielded no candidates for
president, and instead threw their support behind Salas in an
unsuccessful, last ditch effort to tip the election in his favor.

GIANTS ENJOY A HIGHLIGHT IN A SEASON WITH FEW
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ There were exactly two minutes to play and Jake
Plummer had the Arizona Cardinals at the doorstep of the New York
Giants' end zone Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 6 points, Jake the Snake held the football and
another comeback for his budding legend in his hands. He dropped
back, scrambled left then stopped as Giants defensive tackle Keith
Hamilton dove at his feet, clawing with one hand at Plummer's
ankles.
</P>
<P>
   With linemen for both teams falling around him and time getting
short, Plummer glanced toward his favorite receiver, Frank Sanders,
and flung a pass into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Giants linebacker Corey Widmer saw the pass, too, and more
significantly, saw that Sanders was uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Widmer ran back and jumped, the football hitting his hands and
then the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In a season with few moments of exhilaration, the Giants had
come to Arizona and found a day to celebrate. With a 23-19 victory
over the Cardinals, the Giants brought at least a brief moment of
shimmer to a shoddy season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good to enjoy playing football again,'' Widmer said.
``It was emotional and there were mood swings, but when I saw that
football in the air I knew I had to get there. It's the kind of
moment you enjoy for the simple things _ get to that spot and knock
the ball down.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Giants (5-8) will be coming off a victory as they
prepare for next weekend's game with the undefeated Denver Broncos
at Giants Stadium. The Giants, as amazing as it may seem, are just
one game out of the race for the third wild card playoff spot in
the National Football Conference, behind the Cardinals (6-7) and
New Orleans Saints (6-7).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about the playoffs, but I'm glad the Broncos
are still undefeated,'' said Giants defensive end Michael Strahan
who played a spectacular game on Sunday. ``That's how we want
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Strahan also credited the team's week in Arizona preparing to
play the Cardinals as part of the reason for the Giants' improved
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hung out together, we had roommates, we were a team
again,'' Strahan said. ``I think it loosened the guys up. We
remembered how lucky we are to play football.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helped that they were playing the Cardinals, who have
now lost four successive games to the Giants and 9 of the last 11
between the teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why we play better against them,'' said Giants
Coach Jim Fassel, who is 4-0 against the team where he was once
offensive coordinator. ``I wish I knew so I could work on it
against the other teams on our schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' success on Sunday was largely due to their running
game. The Giants rushed for 200 yards, with Gary Brown gaining 124
yards on 25 carries. When the Giants defeated the Cardinals in
October, they followed the same formula, rushing for 141 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Giants quarterback Kent Graham completed 8 of 23 passes for 144
yards _ a workmanlike performance that Fassel suggested would
probably be good enough for him to keep Graham in the starting
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   A tedious, poorly played first half _ the Giants would have 13
penalties for 100 yards _ surprisingly led to a spirited second
half. The momentum of the game seemed to shift from the Cardinals
to the Giants when the Giants scored on their first possession of
the third quarter, driving 63 yards on 11 plays to cut the
Cardinals' lead to 17-13 on a 28-yard field goal by Brad Daluiso.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants then took the lead when they used seven consecutive
running plays and scored a touchdown on an 8-yard burst by fullback
Charles Way. Ahead by 20-17, the Giants later added a 45-yard,
fourth-quarter field goal by Daluiso and conceded a safety on a
punt in the final minute to protect their 6-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the third quarter, a goal-line stand by the Giants
defense set the tone for the rest of the game. Plummer led the
Cardinals to the Giants' 1-yard line, but a run by Mario Bates lost
a yard and a busted play cost Arizona 2 more yards when Strahan
chased down Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer then threw an ill-advised pass into the end zone as he
was being hit by Giants defensive linemen Chad Bratzke and
Christian Peter. Giants reserve cornerback Jeremy Lincoln
intercepted Plummer's pass.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer may have had an uneven game, but he was at his best in
the Cardinals' initial scoring drive in the first quarter, twice
scrambling for first downs when his receivers were covered. Then,
from the Giants' 20-yard line, Plummer tossed a perfect shovel pass
to Adrian Murrell, whose dash up the middle of the field split the
retreating Giants defense for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the Giants came right back to tie the score, 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   After an incomplete pass on first down, two consecutive false
starts by Giants linemen and a 1-yard run by Way, the Giants called
a screen pass to Tiki Barber on third-and-19.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Cardinals were blitzing, when Barber caught the ball,
there was an open path and two blockers before him.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Ron Stone gave Barber one block and wide receiver Chris
Calloway sealed the inside pursuit and Barber was suddenly in the
clear with 60 yards of open field for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals used the screen pass to great success on their
next possession, thanks to some inadequate tackling by the Giants.
Plummer hit Larry Centers up the right sideline, and he juked
several Giants out of his path _ most notably free safety Tito
Wooten.
</P>
<P>
   The play was good for 54 yards. On the next play, Murrell ran up
the middle, dragging linebacker Marcus Buckley for a few yards and
blowing past Wooten, who missed another tackle at the goal line.
Murrell's 8-yard touchdown run gave Arizona a 14-7 lead, a lead
they extended with a 21-yard Chris Jacke field goal in the second
quarter.

James P. Hoffa, center, being congratulated on his election as
president of the teamsters' union after his main opponent, Tom
Leedham, conceded defeat Saturday. The victory returns the Hoffa

led the organization from 1957 to 1971. (Justin Lane/New York Times

12-06 -- Rhoda Wright's unemployment insurance will run out six
months before she completes an accounting course, but she is more
worried that her husband, Ronald, might fall ill, forcing her to
quit school. ``I don't have a clue anymore what our income is going
to be, but we'll get by,'' says Mrs. Wright, 49. ``We always

China allows those with grievances against local authorities to
appeal up the chain to county and national officials. In Beijing,
scores have been waiting for decades for recourse in presenting

In Beijing, scores have been waiting for decades for recourse in

FBN-JETS-SEAHAWKS, 12-6 -- New York Jets quarterback Vinny
Testaverde after his 5-yard sneak on fourth down with 20 seconds
left Sunday. The play was ruled a touchdown, giving the Jets a
32-31 decision over the Seattle Seahawks. Television replays
clearly showed that Testaverde hadn't reached the end zone, but
since such replays are no longer used in the NFL, the touchdown
counted. (Barton Silverman/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT2) KINSHASA, Congo -- Dec. 6, 1998 -- CONGO-REVIEW-2, 12-06
-- While the whole of Congo is being fought over by fewer than
70,000 men, a child soldier takes a break in Kinshasa. What has
developed in Congo is a tribal war along lines that are almost
biblical -- rulers from Nilotic ethnic groups in Rwanda, Burundi
and Uganda against Bantu peoples of central and southern Africa in
league with Arab rulers of northern Chad and Sudan. Sadly, greed
and hatred are the two strongest, and children suffer the most.

   (NYT1) MBUJI-MAYI, Congo -- Dec. 6, 1998 -- CONGO-REVIEW-1,
12-06 -- Impoverished young men search for diamonds in the mud at a
small mine near Mbuji-Mayi. As war grinds on, hope for the future
keeps receding in Congo, the huge central African country formerly
known as Zaire. Every force in the Congo fights for a different
reason. Sadly, greed and hatred are the two strongest, and children
suffer the most. (Robert Grossman/New York Times Photo)

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ A quarterback sneak!
</P>
<P>
   For all of pro football's modern complexities, and on a day when
the air was filled with passes, something as elementary as a
schoolyard play may have pushed the New York Jets into a magical
season.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde recalled that when he was a kid growing up on
Long Island, playing football in sandlots, the mark of being the
best athlete was to be the quarterback and call your own plays. As
football became more sophisticated, and defensive players became
bigger, the quarterback sneak was gradually abandoned. Used only
when needed.
</P>
<P>
   But with 27 seconds left Sunday, with the Jets facing
fourth-and-goal at the 5-yard line, trailing the Seattle Seahawks
by 31-26, Testaverde walked over to coach Bill Parcells with his
assessment of the situation: The Seahawks' middle seemed soft. The
defense, preoccupied with slant passes to Keyshawn Johnson, was
loosening up. The play Testaverde wanted would give him two
options: He could run, or, if the defense bunched up in the ``box''
a 5-yard area between the defensive tackles extending back to the
linebackers, he would fire another slant pass to Keyshawn Johnson
or Leon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde said: ``I told him, `I think we should run this play.
I think I can make it if it's the run; and if it's the pass, you
got a couple of your best receivers out there.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The pass we were going with had worked all day,'' he added,
referring to slant passes to Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet.
``Odds were in our favor.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, with the Jets facing a third and 9,
Testaverde rumbled for a crucial first down. He didn't slide; he
rumbled and forced the defensive back to wrestle him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going to take everybody contributing on every play,''
Testaverde said. ``I just wanted to keep the drive alive.''
</P>
<P>
   But with 27 seconds left, the game _ and possibly the season _
was on the line.
</P>
<P>
   So the Jets came out in spread formation with five receivers.
Seattle took one look at the Jets' formation, looked at Curtis
Martin on the Jets' sideline, and the defense thought pass.
Prepared for pass. Testaverde had thrown a career-high 63 passes
Sunday, and had completed a career-high 42.
</P>
<P>
   Surely this would be attempt No. 64. The Seahawks doubled
Keyshawn Johnson, one defender playing him for an inside route, the
other for an outside route. The defense saw the Jets and thought
pass. Testaverde saw the defense and flashed run. All he saw was an
empty middle and an end zone beckoning. So like the kid on the
playground, he called his own number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I followed Kevin Mawae right to the end zone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ball may not have broken the plane of the goal
line, Testaverde scored in the officials' eyes. Defensive back Jay
Bellamy said the Seahawks' defense hadn't been fooled. ``How can
you be surprised if you stopped something?'' he said. ``We stopped
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said he couldn't tell. ``To be honest,'' he said, ``we
were all down on the sideline, eyes closed, praying.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde's touchdown salvaged what had been an odd day for
Parcells. There are calls that make coaches look like Lombardi on
one series and Kotite the next. Parcells visited both worlds on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On third-and-goal in the first half, he sent Ray Lucas in for
Testaverde at quarterback and moved Testaverde to the slot. Lucas
hadn't played a serious down at quarterback since last December in
a crucial, season-ending game at Detroit. On Sunday, the play
failed.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, down by 31-26, the Jets faced
fourth-and-9 at the Seattle 20-yard line. Parcells elected to go
for it rather than to take a field goal. ``The way our defense was
playing, I wasn't sure whether I'd get the ball back,'' Parcells
explained.
</P>
<P>
   When someone argued that the defense wasn't playing that poorly
at that juncture of the game, Parcells bristled. ``How many points
did they score?'' he said. ``Thirty-one. You call that playing
well? Why don't you come here and tell everybody how the team's
playing?''
</P>
<P>
   The coach said that he wasn't trying to be a wise guy. ``This
was a hard-fought game,'' he said. ``I'm quite emotional. We make
decisions under pressure. It doesn't always turn out right.
Sometimes you roll the dice: Sometimes they come up 2s and 3s or
12s; other times they come up 7 or 11. I feel sorry for the guys in
the Seattle locker room. I've been there.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a quarterback's athletic play made it all turn out
right for the Jets. Are the Jets lucky or are the Jets blessed? The
answers were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a luck person,'' Martin said. ``I believe that all
things happen for a reason. I do believe that things went our way
today.''
</P>
<P>
   From Parcells' perspective, the Jets are blessed with good luck.
``God's playing in some of these games,'' he said. ``And He was on
our side today.'' &QL;

ABRAHAM FEINBERG, 90, PHILANTHROPIST FOR ISRAEL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Abraham Feinberg, a businessman, philanthropist and
supporter of Israel, died Saturday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 90 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Feinberg rose from modest beginnings to become chairman of a New
York-based apparel manufacturer, Kayser-Roth Corp., and then
chairman of American Bank and Trust Co., which was bought in 1978
by Bank Leumi, an Israeli institution. At his death he was chief
executive of Central Bottling Corp., a beverage-bottling business
in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He also invested in businesses based in the United States and in
Israel and was involved in the construction of buildings in
Manhattan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In the political world, he led many Democratic fund-raising
drives. His family said he played an important role in providing
financial support for President Harry Truman's successful
whistle-stop campaign for re-election in 1948. In 1952, while the
country was waiting to see whether Truman would run again, Feinberg
visited him at the White House and then told reporters the
president had not made up his mind. Truman later declined his
party's renomination.
</P>
<P>
   Feinberg was also long active in support for Israel and in
philanthropy. After World War II, and before Israel was founded in
1948, he helped displaced European Jews to move on to what was then
Palestine. He became president of Americans for Haganah, which was
the military organization of the main Zionist movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``During that period,'' he said in a 1950 interview, ``I helped
to mobilize support of all kinds for people who were fighting their
great battle for independence.'' His family said that he was active
in getting weapons for Haganah and that he also helped Israel
acquire other military equipment in later years.
</P>
<P>
   He accompanied Chaim Weizmann, Israel's first president, to his
first meeting with Truman, and a substantial U.S. loan to Israel
ensued, his family recalled. His family also said he had useful
informal contacts with the Israeli and American governments during
some Middle East crises.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Feinberg was for 17 years the chairman of the
Development Corporation for Israel, also known as the Israel Bonds.
He was also a major supporter of the Weizmann Institute of Science
in Israel and its chairman for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, when Feinberg was honored by B'nai B'rith as its Man of
the Year, Truman observed that in addition to the good works by
Feinberg that had been made public, ``I could name two or three
times as many that he has done anonymously, without personal credit
and always at sacrifice to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   One beneficiary of Feinberg's largess was Brandeis University,
in Waltham, Mass., whose board of trustees he formerly headed.
Earlier this year, his family said, he made it known that he was
giving the university $13 million to set up an International Center
for Ethics, Justice and Public Life with campuses in Massachusetts
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a former member of the New York City Board of Higher
Education.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in the Bronx, he graduated from Townsend Harris
High School in Manhattan and had all his higher education at night:
he attended City College and received law degrees in 1929 from
Fordham and in 1936 from New York University.
</P>
<P>
   By day, he started out in the clothing industry on a modest
scale working with his father in hosiery sales.
</P>
<P>
   Feinberg is survived by his wife of 69 years, the former Lillian
Farber of Manhattan; one daughter, Judith Schneider Weissberg, a
psychologist, of Manhattan; four grandchildren; six
great-grandchildren; a brother, Wilfred, of Manhattan, the former
Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit; and a sister, Belle Feinberg of Manhattan.

 NEW YORK'S SECRET WEAPON IN THE TRASH WARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since Mayor Rudolph Giuliani unveiled his plan to
ship New York's trash across the harbor, New Jersey's politicians
have had a wonderful time promising to stop it. They think they can
insult New York _ ``Drop Dead'' was a headline in Gov. Christine
Todd Whitman's news release _ and repel our trash barges from their
shores without suffering any consequences.
</P>
<P>
   They are naive. New York has a weapon in reserve if they
continue the garbage war. But before revealing it, before
escalating tensions, let's peacefully reach across the river and
try to understand what this fight is all about.
</P>
<P>
   It's not about garbage. It's about self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   New Jerseyans are understandably sensitive about their state's
image, which for most outsiders is the one glimpsed along the New
Jersey Turnpike: swamps, junkyards, smokestacks and refineries.
Unlike New York, where highway builders stupidly intruded on lovely
parks and shorelines and neighborhoods, New Jersey's planners had
the sense to preserve their scenic areas by running their main
highway through the state's underbelly.
</P>
<P>
   It was excellent environmental planning but terrible public
relations, which is why New Jerseyans living in beautiful
surroundings far from the turnpike must endure taunts from New
Yorkers living in squalor. No wonder New Jerseyans' first instinct
is to resist any new trash from their tormentors.
</P>
<P>
   But this trash is actually an opportunity for New Jersey to
profit at New York's expense. New Jersey would gain jobs and tax
revenues from the private companies that would unload the barges,
routing some of the trash to a local incinerator (New Jersey's
incinerators need more business) and packing the rest in sealed
containers for shipment to out-of-state landfills.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's politicians worry that New York's garbage would
despoil the state's beaches. But the city's barges would be
unloaded in new enclosed plants far from any beach, on the old
industrial waterfronts of Carteret and Newark. The Newark site is
near a garbage incinerator, the Pulaski Skyway and a plot of land
contaminated by dioxin from a factory that made Agent Orange. Club
Med will not be opening a resort there anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's politicians could learn from officials in Virginia
who gladly accept trash from both New York and New Jersey. Instead
of whining about being a ``dumping ground,'' these politicians have
used the revenue from their landfills to lower property taxes and
build new schools. When Congress was considering a bill to ban the
interstate shipment of trash, these Virginia officials pleaded to
keep it flowing.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was relatively easy for them, because Virginia
does not have New Jersey's image problem. Virginians look down on
the rest of America. They can pocket New York's trash money without
suffering an identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But with a little courage, maybe New Jersey could learn to
acquire that same confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if a brave politician announced: ``Let's take the boors
across the river for everything they've got. New York's garbage
money will make the Garden State yet greener! To take trash is not
to be trash!''
</P>
<P>
   All right, that is tough to imagine. Maybe there is no stopping
this garbage war. But before they go any further, New Jersey's
politicians should at least be warned of the weapon at New York's
disposal. We too can refuse to be a dumping ground.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, New Jersey's capitalists send trucks across the river
with loads of materials destined for our trash heaps. Their farmers
ship fresh blueberries and tomatoes, knowing full well that some of
them will rot. Millions of disposable items are sold in New York by
companies based in New Jersey _ drugs from by Hoffman-LaRoche and
Merck, toys from Toys ``R'' Us, groceries from A &AMP; P and Pathmark.
</P>
<P>
   Why should we keep buying from economic warriors who think
interstate commerce should flow in only one direction? If they
won't take our garbage, why should we take their sources of
garbage?
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers would probably be glad to start buying from
companies in friendlier states, especially if the boycott gave them
an excuse to walk around wearing ``I Hate NJ'' buttons. That would
not be good for New Jersey's industries or its politicians. And it
is definitely not going to do anything for their self-esteem.

COMMENTARY: KILL ALL THE LAWYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Today _ Dec. 7, 1998 _ is a date that will live in
Justice Department infamy. This is the day that Janet Reno is
likely to give the man at whose pleasure she serves a free pass for
taking $73 million in public funds under false pretenses.
</P>
<P>
   He conspired to raise millions more, as evidenced by official
White House films, for his own campaign _ contrary to law. His
``Asian connection'' financing of the TV spots he wrote himself
compounded the illegality.
</P>
<P>
   How is Reno expected to justify refusing to turn over to
independent counsel her deeply conflicted, two-years-and-counting,
minor-players-only ``investigation''? Easy: his lawyers made him do
it. Because Clinton followed the advice of counsel, he could not be
held responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Try using that excuse on the IRS: Gee, my accountant thought it
wasn't fraud. If Clinton's lawyers had tried to restrain him,
others eager to understand his need for TV spots would have
replaced them. Under Reno's theory, because his lawyers decide what
the law is, the president can do no wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, this Clinton reliance on lawyers has led him to
the brink of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   All through this year of what ``is'' is, lawyers whose first
priority is to keep him out of legal jeopardy have set the
president's political strategy. To this day, he insists he never
lied under oath. To preserve this legal position before a grand
jury, he was forced to swear repeatedly to an absurdity: that he
never intimately touched his inamorata.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Democrats won the election. Certain he was home free,
he showed his contempt for Congress by going off to play golf while
his lawyers prepared evasive answers to judiciary's 81 questions.
His lawyers' message: Wrap this nonsense up in a hurry. Impeach him
if you dare.
</P>
<P>
   That stiffing stiffened the spines of moderates who might just
dare. As a result, his lawyers have switched from hurry Hyde to
delay DeLay. But having complained so loudly about dragging the
inquiry out, it's too late to complain about a rush to judgment.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers have based everything on avoiding admission of
crime. But in protecting him from a possible indictment someday,
they invited impeachment. Huge mistake.
</P>
<P>
   He has never been in danger of ``jail to the chief.'' Even if
indicted after leaving office, he would win acquittal at trial. If
the impossible happened, his successor, especially if Republican,
would pardon him.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he in danger of removal by the Senate after House
impeachment. In the absence of public outrage, perjury about sex is
insufficient cause for such a Draconian solution
</P>
<P>
   His only danger is impeachment, the meaningful censure. That
word would appear in the first sentence of his obituary. For
Clinton, avoiding impeachment should take precedence over any
embarrassment or legal liability.
</P>
<P>
   How? As Shakespeare suggested, first kill all his lawyers. They
now plan two days of argument about why lying under oath isn't
really perjury, or why perjury about sex doesn't count, or why
Monica wasn't given a Miranda warning. They stubbornly ignore the
First Law of Holes: when in one, stop digging.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mr. President, take a daring new course. Pay a surprise
visit to the committee. Dissociate yourself dramatically from all
past legalistic hair-splitting. Admit that it's fair to say you
lied under oath _ not ``misled'' but lied _ and show that you are
unafraid to face prosecution later.
</P>
<P>
   Say that that you are ashamed not just of your behavior but of
your cover-up. Promise that, if not impeached, you will carry out
the laws more faithfully than any president ever did.
</P>
<P>
   Would this pre-emptive strike work for Clinton? Twenty
Republican moderates would bolt in a heartbeat. Confession up front
would be better for the nation's business and the rule of law than
impeachment, a Senate trial through January and _ presuming a third
of the Senate refuses to convict _ the grudging signature of a
plea-bargainer on a joint resolution of censure.
</P>
<P>
   Would Clinton dare? Past performance suggests he will continue
his legalistic dodging while striking a pose of penitence _ deny,
deny, deny, but sorrowfully. Following the Reno rules, he will
explain to history that he cannot be blamed for the demeaning
result of impeachment because he was misled by counsel.

   RESTORED GLORY
</P>
<P>
   In the 16th and 17th centuries, emperors, kings, dukes and
cities across Europe commissioned his bronzes for palaces, gardens
and churches. But after his death, his name receded from
prominence. Perhaps it was because this artist worked outside his
native Netherlands or because his style was so individual that he
attracted no flock of imitators. Then, in 1989, he aroused fresh
interest when the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., paid more
than $10 million for one of his sculptures. On Saturday the artist,
Adriaen de Vries, will be the focus of a major retrospective at the
Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Continuing until March 14, this show,
``Adriaen de Vries, 1556-1626: Imperial Sculptor,'' assembles 50 de
Vries bronzes, 70 percent of his known work, from public and
private sources, ranging from the Louvre in Paris and the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan to the collection of Queen
Elizabeth II of Britain. In addition, some 25 works on paper will
be displayed. Information: 011-31-20-673-21-21.

<P>
   The first of Roald Dahl's stories to be set as opera will come
to the stage on Wednesday when the Los Angeles Opera presents the
world premiere of Tobias Picker's ``Fantastic Mr. Fox,'' with
libretto by Donald Sturrock, its director. Conducted by Peter Ash
and with whimsical sets and costumes by Gerald Scarfe, and with the
Canadian baritone Gerald Finley in the title role, the opera about
foxes versus farmers will run at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for
seven performances through Dec. 22. Information: (213) 972-8001.

   SECOND ACTS
</P>
<P>
   For the second production of its 20th season at the Loeb Drama
Center in Cambridge, Mass., the American Repertory Theater will

   HARTFORD, Conn. _ As resistance to a proposed stadium deal
budded among Connecticut lawmakers this weekend, Gov. John Rowland
and the New England Patriots signaled for the first time that they
were willing to make changes in a plan to bring the team to
Hartford that had been presented to lawmakers as a
take-it-or-leave-it deal.
</P>
<P>
   In a concession to critics, the governor said he would add a
requirement that the Patriots pay cash for the stadium if they left
Hartford before the end of a proposed 30-year lease, and the team
said it would accept.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers had begun to bridle at the many incentives in the
tentative agreement the governor signed last month with the
Patriots' owner, Robert Kraft. The governor said he recognized that
he had to reassure legislators as they begin debating the deal on
Wednesday, and he said he would start by adding a requirement that
the Patriots stay for the full 30 years or else pay off the debt
the state would incur to build the stadium. The estimated cost of
the stadium would be $375 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Patriots were to leave after 15 years, their payback
would be literally the rest of the bonds, which may be $100, $150,
$200 million,'' Rowland said in an interview after a banquet
Saturday night. ``We'll basically have language that says if you
leave early, you have to pay off the balance. That's pretty
devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Wasynczuk, the Patriots' vice president for business
operations, said the National Football League team was willing to
accept such a provision and did not consider it a change in the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's appropriate because the state needs protection, and our
intention is to be there for 30 years or beyond,'' Wasynczuk said.
He suggested separately that legislators should not get the idea
that they could start rewriting the deal that the Governor and
Kraft signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our minds, we are in an education process to be sure
everybody understands the deal,'' Wasynczuk said. ``We've gone
through the negotiation phase already.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, a Republican, secured the support of the leaders of the
House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Democrats, before
announcing the deal, and the leaders had indicated that they would
not allow rank-and-file members to tinker with the agreement, since
any change would give Kraft license to back out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have an amendment that materially changes the deal,
that's like voting no,'' the House speaker, Thomas Ritter, said
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and the team seem likely to face pressure to adjust
the terms, however. A dozen lawmakers from throughout the state
said calls from constituents were running heavily against the deal
with the Patriots, and several legislators spent the weekend trying
to convince their colleagues that the proposal would prove costly
to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a lot of unraveling happening,'' said Rep.
Louis P. Esposito Jr., a West Haven Democrat. ``I think this was
thrown together, and if people really looked at what it will mean
in the long run, they would be calling up screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Demetrios Giannaros, a Democrat who is an economics
professor at the University of Hartford, said he had talked to 15
to 20 of his colleagues across the ideological spectrum and
described them as very skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information that we have is limited, insufficient and
questionable,'' he said. ``I don't think any of us has a problem
with the Patriots coming to town, but we have to ask if this is
really a good investment, given the alternative investments we
could be making in education or in returning the money to
taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   The most widely questioned provision is a guarantee that the
state will pay the Patriots up to $17.5 million a year if luxury
suites and seats are not sold. Rowland said it might be possible to
``tighten'' that guarantee, but he said he believed he would be
able to allay lawmakers' fears by demonstrating that demand is
strong. He said the state or the team had commitments for about 80
of the 150 luxury boxes.

NEIGHBORS CRY `ENOUGH CULTURE,' OPPOSE GETTY EXPANSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
By PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A not-in-my-backyard dispute has surfaced in the
tony Pacific Palisades enclave, pitting culture against affluence
and throwing a kink into plans to reopen the original, historic J.
Paul Getty museum as a grander, new Getty Villa.
</P>
<P>
   The Getty Institute proposes combining antiquity exhibitions and
conservation research on its bluff-top estate, which closed as a
museum in 1997, when the Getty Center opened in Brentwood. The new
Getty Villa would place Los Angeles higher on the world's cultural
map, supporters say.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans are tempered, however, by neighbors who would just
as soon not have the same headaches as Brentwood residents faced
when the new Getty museum opened a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cie(cq) Allman lives just paces from the Villa's entrance. The
host of a morning television workout show, ``Infinite Power
Workout,'' said it's a shame the Getty was closed, but the
community doesn't need it re-opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably have enough culture already,'' she said. ``The
Palisades is not a Mecca. We want to be left alone. That's why
people like Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks and Arnold Schwarzenegger live
here.'' &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The dispute comes to a head Monday, when the Pacific Palisades
Community Council, an advisory panel to the Los Angeles City
Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, is scheduled to consider approving
the Getty's expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
   The local council last month recommended approval for the
estate's renovation, but it remains opposed to expansion. In the
end, the issue will be resolved by the City Council, which
traditionally listens to the local council members.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the battle is the J. Paul Getty Trust, with its
$170 million plan to revive the 53-year-old site as a museum
devoted to antiquities and the study of ancient art, archeology and
conservation.
</P>
<P>
   On the other is the Palisades council, which believes the
expansion will cause annoying evening tumult and add congestion to
the already gridlocked Pacific Coast Highway.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the issue is a proposed 95,000-square-foot
expansion of the museum at the original estate, which was closed in
1997 when the Getty Center opened.
</P>
<P>
   The site would include a 600-seat outdoor ampitheater, expanded
food and alcohol service and a 610-car parking structure.
</P>
<P>
   Located just off PCH on Coastline Road, the Villa would also
have expanded business hours, improved access for the disabled, a
relocated entrance and wider access for emergency crews, said
Marion True, assistant director of Villa planning.
</P>
<P>
   Purchased in 1945 by Getty as a ranch house and a place to
display his art, the site already has its original museum and two
other buildings serving as art and conservation laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase would be a 45,000-foot expansion. If approved,
the Getty Trust would create a new entry pavillion, a tea room, an
expanded bookstore and an underground auditorium to compliment the
ampitheater.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase would add 50,000 more square feet, including
the parking structure, a garden building and additions to the art
and conservation labs.
</P>
<P>
   The Getty Foundation plans to hold lectures and seminars for
those with interests in antiquities and ancient culture. The
ampitheater will be host to a variety of ancient theater and
symphonic music, True said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Wilson, president of the Pacific Palisades Community
Council, and member Shirley Haggstrom both said they are
``thrilled'' at the thought of breathing new life into the facility
that was shut down in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the council unanimously approved support for two-thirds
of the project at its Nov. 12 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   That vote approved renovation, but expansion is a different
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traffic is the main reason,'' Wilson said. ``It's a
difficult position to take weighing the benefits of culture against
community impact, but what they are proposing will definitely have
an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   People living in the shadow of the project agreed. Most
residents declined to give their names but said they were against
the project, citing a myriad of expected headaches.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is trying to reach a compromise with the council,
and are dedicated to addressing its concerns, True said.
</P>
<P>
   ``PCH traffic is a delicate issue in the first place, so we're
working to see how we can facilitate this,'' True said. ``We've
always been a good neighbor to the community and we have no
intention of disrupting the quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Miscikowski, who represents the area and lives near the new
Getty Center, is confident both sides will eventually come to
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both parties have agreed to about 25 of the 30 issues that are
on the table,'' said Linda Bernhardt, Miscikowski's senior planning
deputy. ``The remaining items are hot-button issues that probably
won't be resolved until the very end. I'm sure we'll come to some
middle ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: the Los Angeles City Council will make the
final decision despite lobbying efforts of the Pacific Palisades
Community Council. While it's unlikely, the project can still be
killed altogether, or the Getty Foundation could be allowed to go
forward with few restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   That thought doesn't bother Wilson. The council has been around
for more than 25 years and he is confident its voice will be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the nonpartisan voice of the community and our votes
are an expression of opinion,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no jurisdictional authority and no veto power. But
we've been around a long time and we have a great relationship with
our city councilwoman.''

EDITORIAL: THE AMA'S `PARTIAL BIRTH' FIASCO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Monday, Dec. 7:
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association blundered badly when it
endorsed a Republican bill last year banning so-called partial
birth abortion. That blunt conclusion, reached long ago by many
doctors, has now been echoed by consultants the AMA hired to
investigate the debacle. Confronted with this finding, the
organization has but one honorable path. It ought to use the
gathering of its house of delegates this week in Honolulu to
rescind its support for an abortion measure that intrudes on
decisions best made by women and their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the consulting firm of Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton
paints a devastating picture of a politically naive organization so
consumed by the desire to cut a deal and to protect the financial
interests of doctors on Medicare issues that it ``lost sight of its
responsibility for making decisions which, first and foremost,
benefit the patient and protect the physician-patient
relationship.'' Trustees of the organization, rookies in the
high-pressure game of congressional negotiations, ended up
supporting the legislation, the report notes, even after failing to
win concessions to address valid concerns about placing doctors in
legal jeopardy by criminalizing a medical procedure the legislation
defines only vaguely.
</P>
<P>
   Although the partial birth bill was vetoed by President Clinton,
Congress, buttressed by the AMA position, came within three votes
of overriding the veto. The bill's sponsors plan to introduce it
again next spring. Moreover, the AMA's endorsement has helped
encourage many state legislatures to impose partial birth bans of
their own. In 18 states where such bans have been enacted, courts
have blocked or severely limited their implementation, finding that
the legislative definitions could cover the most commonly used
abortion procedures, in violation of Roe vs. Wade. Inevitably, the
issue will reach the Supreme Court, where the position taken by the
AMA is bound to be influential. The group should correct its
mistake on partial birth abortion before it causes more confusion
and damage.

LETTER TO FIRST CAT BRINGS FAME TO MISSOURI GIRL

<P>
   BOONVILLE, Mo. _ At age 9, Anna Campbell already has composed a
poem for a baby's baptism. She has illustrated a book of her own
verses. And after seeing ``Titanic,'' she went straight home and
started a screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   But what has made her famous? The letter she wrote last year to
Socks, the White House cat.
</P>
<P>
   Anna's letter was one of 55 to appear in first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton's new book, Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids' Letters to
the First Pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a writer when I grow up, and I think it's pretty
neat to have something I wrote published in a book,'' said Anna, a
fourth-grader at Barton Elementary School in Boonville in central
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Anna wrote to Socks as part of a school lesson on
letter-writing. Although the book landed in stores Nov. 17, Anna
didn't know until this week that her letter was selected from
300,000 notes and drawings children had sent to the Clintons' pets.
</P>
<P>
   Her letter is the only contribution from a child living in
Kansas or Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Socks,'' begins her letter on Page 93. ``How does it feel
to live in the White House? What is your favorite hiding place in
the White House? Do you shed a lot? Does the president drink alot
of coffee? He might want to switch to decafe! Ha! Ha! Your friend,
Anna Campbell.''
</P>
<P>
   A postscript asked Socks to write back, but Anna isn't expecting
to hear from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a really busy cat,'' Anna said. ``I probably wouldn't be
able to read cat words anyway.''

EDITORIAL: A SENSIBLE SETTLEMENT FOR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Dec. 7:
</P>
<P>
   An innovative settlement of the class-action lawsuit against the
troubled New York City child-welfare system offers hope that reform
will take place at a swifter pace. The suit, brought by Children's
Rights in 1995, charged the city and state with violating state and
federal law in failing to protect 100,000 abused or neglected
children.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani brought in Nicholas Scoppetta to overhaul
the system in 1996 after the murder of 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo
by her mother. But even after hiring more social workers and
reducing caseloads, deficiencies persist in supervision of
caseworkers and monitoring of cases. Some children have continued
to suffer abuse even though they are supposedly under the city's
watch.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed before the reforms by Scoppetta, commissioner
of the Administration for Children's Services, forced the city to
answer critics who wanted more dramatic progress. But Children's
Rights saw that a protracted legal battle would not hasten reform.
Any court-ordered changes would still require the cooperation of
government officials to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have now agreed to set aside the litigation for a new
approach. An independent panel of experts will assist the agency
and review its progress over the next two years. It will be
financed by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, which is devoted to
children's issues, to insure the panel's independence. The panel,
which will have full access to agency operations and records, will
issue recommendations, but the agency will be free to fashion its
own solutions. If the panel finds that the city has not acted in
good faith on reform, the plaintiffs can renew the litigation and
seek court intervention.
</P>
<P>
   A separate settlement requires the state to monitor the agency's
compliance with state law and conduct reviews of case records.
These agreements will surely serve children better than spending
more time in the courtroom.

RESPECT CO-WORKERS' OPINIONS ABOUT SHARING POINTS OF VIEW IN
OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Some people like strong, opinionated conversation.
President Clinton? Abortion? Affirmative action? Whatever the
topic, some simply like to debate. Others are passionate about
specific issues and love to proselytize about positions they hold
dear.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those people who shy away from talking about
anything more controversial than the weather. They're uncomfortable
with strongly stated opinions and they're disinclined to share
their own. Where the first camp relishes ``debate,'' this camp
fears ``argument.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens when those two types are thrown together in the
workplace?
</P>
<P>
   Here's one reader's view: ``I suppose that vigorous discussion
can be a good thing in the proper context. However, when these
things are brought into a place where people are supposed to be
working together for some common good, I think they produce ill
will and tension.''
</P>
<P>
   Career paths are made or wrecked because of interpersonal
relationships. Thus, it's important for anyone who cares about
promotability to be sensitive to co-workers' and managers'
preferences.
</P>
<P>
   If you work in a vent-at-will organization, where emotionally
charged dialogue seems to be enjoyed, then you're more free to
share your thoughts. You could be branded, though, as an
out-of-touch liberal in a stable of arch conservatives (or
vice-versa) and lose out in office politics if the opposite school
of thought dominates.
</P>
<P>
   If the climate in your organization is distinctly close-mouthed,
then you may want to keep your thoughts to yourself. If you can't
live with that, an employment change might be the best solution.
</P>
<P>
   Workplace harmony and career images are fragile, flexible
things. They depend partly on the tenor of your organization and
the nature of the managers who make career decisions that affect
you.
</P>
<P>
   You need to know if what you thought was a ``neat lunch
discussion'' was their ulcer-inducing pain that left you with an
unfortunate label.

COMMENTARY: UNDEMOCRATIC HOUSE OF LORDS DEFENDS PEOPLES' RIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are few institutions in the world more venerable than
Britain's House of Lords, whose roots date back to the 11th
century. Now, as that institution is about to be changed almost
beyond recognition, it has emerged as a protector of the rights of
individuals at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Law Lords, a group of five peers who serve as
Britain's highest court, surprised many by ruling that the former
Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinochet, can be extradited to Spain to
stand trial. ``International law has made plain that certain types
of conduct, including torture and hostage-taking, are not
acceptable conduct on the part of anyone,'' wrote Lord Nicholls.
</P>
<P>
   The decision has left Britain's Labor government in an
uncomfortable position as it decides whether to permit the
extradition. The Labor Party has long reviled Pinochet, but Prime
Minister Tony Blair also values good relations with Chile and many
in Britain recall the general's help during the 1982 Falklands war
between Britain and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting that the possible discomfort of Blair
played a part in the decision of the Law Lords. But it would be
understandable if some members of the House of Lords were pleased
to see the government squirm. The day before the decision was
announced, Queen Elizabeth II, reading a speech to Parliament that
was written by the government, announced that ``a bill will be
introduced to remove the right of hereditary peers to sit and vote
in the House of Lords.'' She added that it would be the first step
in an effort to make the House more democratic and representative.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, most members of the House of Lords are there by
inheritance, but many were appointed for life by governments chosen
by the Commons. The Law Lords who rendered the Pinochet decision
were appointed to the body.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing hereditary peers to vote is hardly democratic, and
reform is perhaps overdue. But Blair has yet to reveal what further
changes he will make. Having a house composed of only appointed
members is not a model of democracy either.
</P>
<P>
   The powers of the House of Lords are already limited. It cannot
block money bills, and other legislation can be delayed for no more
than two years. As Walter Bagehot, the British journalist and
historian, wrote 126 years ago, ``The House of Lords must yield
whenever the opinion of the Commons is also the opinion of the
nation, and when it is clear that the nation has made up its
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, the House of Lords is now involved in what may be
such a fight. It is resisting a government bill _ already approved
by the Commons _ to change the way Britain chooses its delegates to
the European Parliament. The new electoral system would make it all
but impossible for a European Parliament candidate opposed by his
or her party's leaders to win election, thereby making it more
likely delegates would do as they were told. Members of the House
of Lords, that most undemocratic of institutions, say that is not
very democratic. They would seem to have a point.

SAVING MONEY IS A MEANS TO AN END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: America's bad saving statistics are useless except to
generate scare headlines that grab the attention of newspaper
readers.
</P>
<P>
   When the personal savings rate recently dived into negative
territory for the first time in 65 years, for instance, it wasn't
nearly as disastrous a development as conventional wisdom
dispensers claimed.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to keep in mind when assessing the significance
of savings data is the fact that savings is a means to an end, not
an end itself. When people save, they're deferring gratification.
Most people deny themselves in the present as a trade-off for a
more rewarding consumption experience in the future. They save to
pay for such things as dream vacations, homes, college for the kids
and better retirements.
</P>
<P>
   What is the optimum savings rate? Who's to say? All that can be
said is that it's just as possible to save too much as it is too
little.
</P>
<P>
   Take Japan, for instance. Although it has one of the highest
savings rates in the world, its economy is a disaster. Its
world-class savings rate has not brought a significantly improved
quality of life, but rather poor business and political decisions
that undermine the well-being of everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Japan's excessive savings fed a pool of investment capital
that grew too large to be used productively. Many of the resulting
attempts to put this money to work went into projects that not only
were unproductive, but often counterproductive. The result is a
country awash in bad debts.
</P>
<P>
   As for America's saving situation, is it as bad as convention
would have us believe? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   Investor's Business Daily recently trotted out some perspectives
that put the savings picture into better balance.
</P>
<P>
   First, the capital gains windfall from the soaring stock market
has allowed more Americans to achieve their savings goals without
actually saving more money.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Commerce Department's methodology is such that it
understates what most people would consider savings. The Japanese,
for instance, save more, but America's home ownership rate is much
higher than Japan's.
</P>
<P>
   The most telling component of the analysis was a review of some
figures from a St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank study published in
1989. This research included in its savings component home buying,
durable goods purchases, capital gains and debt reduction. This
more realistic approach showed the savings rate well above what
official calculations showed from the '50s through the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the matter of Social Security's effect on savings.
When this involuntary form of savings was counted by St. Louis Fed
researchers, it showed the total savings rate rising from 13
percent in the '50s to nearly 25 percent in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Something else to remember is that savings takes numerous forms.
When Uncle Sam achieved a $70 billion surplus this fiscal year, for
instance, this was attributable to expanding tax revenues. Thus,
much of that $70 billion represented a transfer of savings from
people to government.
</P>
<P>
   The most important consideration when weighing the implications
of a savings rate statistic is whether a society's growth is strong
enough to deliver enough jobs and higher living standards for all.

EDITORIAL: NEW VISIONS FOR NATO 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Dec. 7:
</P>
<P>
   Though NATO has played a useful role in suppressing violence in
the Balkans in recent years, it remains a military alliance without
a clear purpose in the wake of the Cold War. Washington's answer to
this identity crisis has been mischievous. First it pushed through
the admission of three new members from Central Europe without
adequately weighing potential consequences. Now it is pressing
ideas that could ultimately lead to transforming the alliance into
a global strike force against threats to American and European
interests. Such a role would go far beyond any sensible mandate.
</P>
<P>
   If Washington's proposals are strictly limited to strengthening
defenses within Europe against biological and chemical weapons and
international terrorism, they are fine. But the Clinton
administration and other NATO governments must guard against
policies that would have the alliance reach out anywhere in the
world. If military intervention is required outside Europe, it
should be conducted by coalitions of willing nations, including
those in the region itself.
</P>
<P>
   Washington would do better to encourage NATO's European members
to assume more of the burdens of maintaining European security and
stability. Western Europe's governments are only now, tentatively,
starting to take limited responsibility for security issues in
Europe, like the Balkans. Their political fortitude is uncertain,
their defense budgets tightly constrained and their military forces
relatively small. NATO's new central European members, Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic, are even less suited for a global
role.
</P>
<P>
   NATO should be worrying primarily about its role in Europe,
which requires much clarification. NATO operations need to be
better coordinated with European civilian institutions, like the
European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe. Recent experience in the Balkans has shown that in the
aftermath of civil war, some tasks are better done by paramilitary
police, humanitarian agencies and diplomats than by heavily armed
NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   Long-running debates must be resolved about what kinds of crises
can best be handled by European NATO members and which require
American involvement. Increased command responsibility may have to
be given to European generals and admirals. These issues have
caused friction between France and the United States. But, with
Britain now moving closer to continental positions and Germany's
new government making clear it wants to re-examine traditional NATO
practices, the alliance's political dynamic is changing.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has always declared itself free to be the first to use
nuclear weapons in any potential conflict. That policy ought to be
reconsidered in the absence of the overwhelming conventional
military threat posed by the old Soviet bloc.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's new role should be premised on more equal partnership in
European defense. America should maintain its commitment to helping
defend its allies against outside threats. But it should expect
them to take on more responsibility for managing anarchy and strife
in their own backyard, not in far corners of the world.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ How can a story that has been told so many
times be made to seem so wholly fresh again?
</P>
<P>
   Partly by the power of the piece itself. And partly through the
craft of the tellers _ in this case, the actors _ who bring it
newly alive.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 155 years and a few days since a debt-burdened
31-year-old English writer put down his pen to let dry the ink on
the last page of a little book he called A Christmas Carol in
Prose, Being a Ghost Story of Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   It was far from the longest book Charles Dickens would write,
and neither the most socially important nor the most lucrative.
Although it sold well, his own monetary returns were disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   But it won for him a fame and affection that has transcended
time, for there have been few works committed to paper that have
lodged so deeply in the public heart.
</P>
<P>
   Over the ensuing century and a half, millions of copies of A
Christmas Carol have been printed in many languages, and the story
has been broadcast uncountable times on the radio and television.
</P>
<P>
   One evening a couple of weeks ago we watched Dickens' vision
given heart and breath on the stage of the Missouri Repertory
Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the one-dimensional animated cliche that a piece so
embedded in the popular culture risks becoming. Instead, it was as
original, as new, as true as life itself _ and not just the life of
mid-19th century London, but our contemporary lives as well.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Carol speaks of timeless matters: the disfiguring
influence of greed and loneliness; the saving power of love; the
possibility, in spite of all, of redemption.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's magic, of course, was in the actors' art.
</P>
<P>
   Surely there can be few callings that ask as much _ to be able,
night after night, to put one's own identity aside and become
another person. And to do it so completely, with such conviction,
that nothing seems merely rehearsed. So that each gesture is
spontaneous, and every line is spoken for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Several in the cast we know as acquaintances or friends, but
that was quickly forgotten. Because when the curtain opened, they'd
been replaced entirely by their inventions.
</P>
<P>
   We were glad for Scrooge's terror when the ghosts of other
Christmases came to torment him in the night.
</P>
<P>
   We wept at the sweet devotion of the Cratchits, and the
difficulties they bore.
</P>
<P>
   Then old Scrooge was found to be encumbered by sentiment after
all, and we wept again.
</P>
<P>
   There was a bit of singing, and Tiny Tim spoke his expected
line. The lights came up. The audience milled to the exits.
</P>
<P>
   After some minutes, the actors began coming out, too, not
seeming at all, now, like workers of magic. They were just ordinary
people _ different ages and sizes and shapes and genders of them _
mostly in careless dress.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing them that way, it was hard to believe the power they'd
had.
</P>
<P>
   For though the night into which we walked was tepid and
unnatural for the season, for us they'd already rolled the year a
whole month forward and rung the holiday in.

CONNECTIONS: IT'S A BATTLEFIELD OUT THERE, CULTURALLY SPEAKING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Does anything exist outside culture? Is there
anything that we do that is free of the distortions of our tastes
and customs? That isn't irrevocably shaped by the languages we
speak or our material interests? Is there anything out there that
we can assume to be noncultural or transcultural or even universal?
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it. Two years ago, Alan Sokal, a New York
University physicist, wrote a satirical paper full of absurdities
and scientific howlers arguing that even ``physical reality'' was
at bottom a ``social and linguistic construct,'' that even famous
numerical constants like pi are culturally dependent, that science
_ presumably the most ``objective'' of human enterprises _ is
culturally determined. He submitted the paper to the trendy
academic journal Social Text as if he was serious. The journal's
editors didn't get the joke, neither catching the errors nor
thinking the paper's assertions absurd. They published it with
pride in a special issue devoted to challenging scientific claims
of objective truth.
</P>
<P>
   The firestorm set off by Sokal's hoax became an international
scandal; more than a hundred reviews, philosophical papers and
debates are now posted on Sokal's Web site
(www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal). Yet what was the result?
</P>
<P>
   Sokal meant to undermine the extreme relativism latent in the
field of ``science studies,'' but the editors defended themselves,
and allies stood up for the mocked positions. There were no
recantations even after the hoax was revealed. It would have been
encouraging if, for instance, even the unchanging nature of pi had
been affirmed, but no such luck. Maybe the whole mess suggested
that there really is no common ground on which proofs can be made,
arguments won, convictions overturned. Science is culture-bound,
and so is argument about it. We are all post-modern (colloquially,
pomo) relativists: You go your way and I'll go mine. If we meet,
it's beautiful. And if we don't, well, that's only to be expected.
</P>
<P>
   But now it's happening again. This time, Sokal, joined by Jean
Bricmont, a Belgian theoretical physicist, wrote a full-scale
polemic that was published in French last year and has just been
released here as ``Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals'
Abuse of Science'' (Picador U.S.A.); it is also being translated
into Catalan, Chinese, Dutch, German, Greek, Hungarian, Portuguese
and other languages.
</P>
<P>
   The authors focus their attack not on American relativists but
on the ornate French intellectuals who are celebrities at American
universities, ranging from critic Julia Kristeva and psychoanalyst
Jacques Lacan to sociologist Bruno Latour and philosopher Gilles
Deleuze.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation: that these star intellectuals display a broad
and deep ignorance of science that is matched only by their nerve
in cryptically using its vocabulary as a smoke screen, often
diminishing science along the way. Thus, the ``erectile organ'' is
compared to the square root of minus one (Lacan); poetic language
is described with bumbling allusions to set theory (Ms. Kristeva);
even Einstein's equation E(EQ)mc2 , is considered a ``sexed
equation'' giving ``privilege'' to the presumably male speed of
light because it's the fastest (Luce Irigaray).
</P>
<P>
   The book's detailed attack on French intellectual life helped
make it a best seller in France. At least 20 essays appeared in Le
Monde alone. And many of the French critics focused not on issues
of substance but on cultural matters. Sokal and Bricmont were
accused of being pedantic foreign grammarians picking apart elegant
(French) love letters. One offended opponent suggested that they
were engaged in a typically American spasm of hatred that was
reminiscent of Kenneth Starr's report. Another critic proposed that
the two authors were like American militarists who, deprived of
Cold War government support, sought a new menace to oppose.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, proclaimed the French counterattacks, this is a
cultural battle, even a political battle, not an intellectual one.
</P>
<P>
   This also resembles a response to the first Sokal affair: many
arguments made it seem that there aren't just two cultures, as C.P.
Snow once famously described the sciences and the humanities; there
are only cultures: French and American, left and right, poetic and
scientistic. Arguments become battles of taste or the scrabbling of
political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sokal is side choosing, explaining that in his attack on
post-modern relativism ``my concern is explicitly political'': to
rescue the left from its pomo taste makers. Meanwhile, he and his
supporters have been denounced for raising the ``specter of left
conservatism.'' And science itself becomes another terrain for
cultural battles.

 NEW YORK: cultural battles. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are, to be sure, good reasons to ask questions about
science. In recent decades, serious scholars have been able to show
how culturally dependent it is. Everything from styles of
experiments to the choices of subjects for research are shaped by
politics, finance and other time-bound forces. Of course this does
not mean that the results of scientific discovery are merely
cultural. (Pi is not a variable.) But nonetheless such assertion
are often made by more orthodox post-modernists, who suggest that
science has no right to special claims of truth.
</P>
<P>
   This position has been more influential than it might seem.
Eager to jump on that bandwagon, even some mathematicians have been
straining (unsuccessfully) to find an example of a culture-bound
mathematical fact. If everything is culture, nothing is immune to
challenge, including, as Sokal and Bricmont argue, courtroom
evidence and archeological evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   And science loses its status. Many of the French writers
attacked in ``Fashionable Nonsense,'' even if they are not
relativists, invoke science not to suggest something rational and
ordered but something baffling and surreal: the origins of the self
( Lacan), the nature of poetry (Ms. Kristeva), the oddities of
modern war (Jean Baudrillard). Science becomes an emblem of
obscurity and oppression.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this is praised in the name of progressive change, but
Sokal and Bricmont dissent. They are disturbed that the
anti-rationalist attack on science is so closely associated with
the political left. They suggest that frustration with the failures
of communism and the success of capitalism may be a reason. So,
too, they say pomo has been influenced by political movements based
on cultural, ethnic and sexual identity, and by the hostility
science has inspired with its military applications.
</P>
<P>
   But this would make pomo a matter of sociological exasperation.
The science debates go to the very heart of the divisions between
the political left and right during the last two centuries. How
much is nature and how much culture? How much is given and how much
is made?
</P>
<P>
   The extremes of the right celebrate the rule of nature, the
unchangeable character of hierarchies, the call of destiny. The
extremes of the left celebrate the relativity of nature, the
malleability of human societies, the self-interest inherent in all
authority. Pomo is a strand of left-wing thinking, just as
fundamentalism is a strand of right-wing thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Sokal has been attacked as a ``left conservative'' because he is
trying to stake out a territory free from the political claims of
culture. That would be the territory of reasoned argument,
objective fact and Enlightenment insight, where even debates like
these might take place. But he is opposing those who consider
themselves to be the most progressive and enlightened: those able
to step outside the prison of culture and see all its distortions.
The irony is that culture is still all they see.

CONTROVERSIES LEAVE INDELIBLE MARK ON CLINTON'S LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In their accounts of his presidency, three
encyclopedias waste no time in getting to the heart of President
Richard Nixon's most enduring legacy:
</P>
<P>
   Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   Their opening paragraphs highlight Nixon's decision to resign
rather than face impeachment over the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Although the scandal that has engulfed President Clinton does
not strike at our system of government the way Watergate did,
Clinton seems destined to bear a similar historical blemish.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from anything else that he may be remembered for _ helping
broker an Irish peace accord or shifting the center of gravity in
Democratic politics _ his personal recklessness will haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be impossible for him to get past a
first paragraph that does not associate his presidency with
disrespect for the rule of law,'' said Earl Black, a Rice
University expert on Southern politics and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton nears a showdown in the House Judiciary Committee this
week that, in more than 200 years, only Nixon and one other
president, Andrew Johnson, have faced. The committee is expected to
vote by the end of the week along partisan lines for at least one
article of impeachment against Clinton _ for perjury in connection
with allegedly lying before a grand jury about his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In Nixon's case, he resigned before a Senate trial. Johnson's
impeachment went to the Senate, but he survived by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, there's no promise that the House will turn down
impeachment. But even if he escapes with a lesser punishment, such
as censure, the mark on his career probably will be indelible.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton is going to carry this with his legacy,''
Rep. Thomas Barrett, a Wisconsin Democrat, said at a Judiciary
Committee hearing last week. ``And when he gets to heaven or
wherever he goes, and you've got all the ex-presidents standing
there, they're going to say, `Well, what was the biggest event in
your last two years?' His legacy is going to be `I either escaped
impeachment' or `I didn't escape impeachment.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So I think that he is carrying a scar with him, and it's a
scar he can't escape, regardless of what this committee does.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue will dominate the week. The president's attorneys will
appear before the Judiciary Committee on Tuesday to present a
defense. The Republican and Democratic staffs will make their
arguments Wednesday, and the members will debate articles of
impeachment on Thursday and Friday. A vote will be either Friday or
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With the Republicans in the majority and every one apparently
pledged to support at least one article related to perjury, the
issue will go before the full House the following week. The outcome
there isn't certain.
</P>
<P>
   If the impeachment measure does pass, the Senate's rules
obligate it to begin a trial at 1 p.m. the day after it receives
the measure from the House and to stay in session until it passes
final judgment. But because the Republicans don't have enough
votes, it's unlikely that the Senate will convict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consequence of this whole procedure will appear in
retrospect to have been rather trivial,'' said Robert Dallek, a
biographer of President Lyndon B. Johnson. Historians, he said,
will puzzle over what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Dallek said Clinton's embattled presidency comes at the end of a
long period of siege that started in the Vietnam War and the
public's disillusionment with Johnson. It continued through
Watergate and the resulting creation of the independent counsel act
to prosecute the executive branch and through the Iran-contra
scandal the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency is ``being brought down to size,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historians will see this, rather than a legitimate impeachment
procedure...as part of a larger process of the decline of the
institution.''
</P>
<P>
   And when they pore over the Clinton era, they'll see a president
caught in a vortex _ some of which came of his own making _ in
which politics and scandal became intertwined. A pall of
allegations about improper behavior, from the political to the
personal, has hovered over him and his administration since the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a dozen independent prosecutors have spent $62
million investigating the president and his administration. And the
Republicans say that another is needed to examine his fund raising
in the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some investigations have been fruitless chases, as evidenced by
the acquittal last week of Mike Espy, Clinton's former agriculture
secretary, on corruption charges. Or the apparent decision by
Kenneth Starr to drop the Whitewater probe of Clinton, the
independent counsel's original portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   But when historians study this period, they will find running
dramas that make Clinton's legacy a bit more complex than simply
casting him as the avatar of political scandal, said Stephen Wayne,
who teaches political science at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is the presidency under scandal, and the other story is
the survival of the president under scandal,'' he said. ``Is he
remembered for the scandal? Sure. Is he remembered that he
survived, persevered and maintained his popularity? Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came into office promising to focus on the economy. Six
years later, with the economy robust, his approval ratings continue
to soar. Meanwhile, the nation remains at peace and, with the end
of Cold War, stands as the principal military power in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any president who puts those things together is going to have
a successful presidency, at least in the eyes of the public,'' said
Richard Brody, who teaches political science at Stanford
University. MORE

THOMAS GOMEZ, A TEACHER AND DANCER, 77
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas W. Gomez, a teacher of the Katherine Dunham technique and
a leading dancer with Ms. Dunham's company in the 1940's, died on
Oct. 29 at the Warren Barr Pavilion, a home for the aged, in
Chicago. He was 77 and lived in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was bone cancer, his son, Thomas Gomez III, of Ann
Arbor Mich., said.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, whose stage name was Tommy Gomez, trained in New York at
the schools of Martha Graham and Jose Limon and at the School of
American Ballet. He met Ms. Dunham in 1939 and by the early 1940s
was a prominent member of her troupe, appearing with her on
Broadway, in European tours and in the film ``Stormy Weather.''
</P>
<P>
   A small, lithe and intense performer known for his good-natured
disposition in a company of larger-than-life temperaments, Gomez
first gained fame as the Boy Possessed in the ``Shango'' section of
``Carib Song.'' He also danced the Jealous Husband in
``Rara-Tonga,'' opposite Ramona Erwin as the wife, whom he later
married in real life in an onstage wedding. Gomez also danced lead
roles in Ms. Dunham's ``Flaming Youth'' and ``L'Ag'Ya.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez took over many of the star roles danced by Talley Beatty
when Beatty left the company. He also partnered Ms. Dunham
frequently. He performed on Broadway as a Dunham dancer in ``Cabin
in the Sky'' and ``Tropical Revue.'' He also danced on Broadway in
``On the Town,'' ``Show Boat'' and ``The King and I.'' On film, he
danced in ``Carnival of Rhythm'' and ``Cleopatra.'' He helped Ms.
Dunham choreograph the 1964 production of ``Aida'' at the
Metropolitan Opera House in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez taught at the Dunham School in New York in the 1940's and
was later a master teacher in annual summer Dunham workshops in St.
Louis. He was on the faculties of the Kennedy King College, Truman
College and Joel Hall Dance Center, all in Chicago. In 1984, he
became the artistic director of the Body Language Dance Company in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   He was honored in 1980 in ``A Gala Celebration of 50 Years of
Men in Dance'' in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Ramona, of
Stamford, Conn.; his mother, Theresa Woosley, of Chicago, and five
grandchildren.

   Historians and political scientists, however, will analyze his
record and may be less forgiving. He continues to struggle with
Iraq over biological weapons and with North Korea over nuclear
weapons. He has had more success in his peacemaking efforts in
Bosnia, Northern Ireland and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 20 years, when all the records are available, we will see
in all kinds of ways that we didn't even know about how his
personal problems and domestic policies affected his foreign
policy,'' said Robert Kagan, a senior associate at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace. ``That's inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways there have been at least three Clinton
presidencies. He campaigned as a centrist, a so-called ``New
Democrat,'' but in his first two years got embroiled in costly
political battles over issues viewed as traditionally liberal _ gay
rights and an unsuccessful health-care reform effort.
</P>
<P>
   After a disastrous midterm election in which Democrats lost
majorities in Congress, he tacked toward the center, reaching out
to Republicans with welfare reform and to set a course for budget
surpluses. He won re-election, but a year later, the Lewinsky
scandal controlled the political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given his re-election, he might have been in a position to
have more policy innovation, but almost immediately he got swept up
in these scandals,'' said John Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss
Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron. ``I think
it took a lot of his energy. His tremendous political skills were
dedicated to saving his own skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Reforming Social Security looms as Clinton's last major effort
to bolster his legacy. At least to this point, he has no monumental
accomplishment to ground him in the history books, as did President
Truman with the Marshall Plan and Johnson with the Civil Rights
Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historians don't find balanced budgets very sexy,'' Dallek
said, so scandal ``will be a kind of focal point. There are no
big-ticket items. These are not heroic times.''

<P>
   The male vocal group Lionheart performed recently at the Church
of St. Mary the Virgin in Manhattan. The audience was completely
absorbed in the chants of 12th-century Paris when a shrill ring of
a cell phone brought everyone rudely back to the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   To general astonishment, a woman left her seat, phone to her
ear, and walked behind a nearby sarcophagus where she proceeded to
talk. The audience could hear her, and members of the group on
stage later told me she was telling the person at the other end of
the line that she was ``at a Lionheart concert'' and that ``they're
singing Renaissance music.'' (Note: It was really medieval, but
what's a few centuries?)
</P>
<P>
   The piece over, the men in the ensemble stopped and looked in
her direction, but she continued talking, oblivious to the fact
that now everyone was looking at her. Finally, an irate member of
the audience walked over and urged her to stop or leave.
</P>
<P>
   She then proceeded up the side aisle, still talking, and turned
into a small chapel to continue. The audience was incensed. Another
member walked over, took her by the arm and led her out of the
church, still talking.
</P>
<P>
   Resuming the concert, Richard Porterfield, a member of the
group, said, ``This piece, appropriately, is about the world going
to hell.'' The audience laughed and the concert continued; the
intrusion of the modern era was over.

   Whenever the Bell family gets in the car for a trip, long or
short, there's a fight over the CD player. Martin Bell, the father,
wants Bob Dylan; Daniel, the teen-age son, wants Green Day or
Offspring, and Frances, the 9-year-old daughter, screams for the
Spice Girls or some other group du jour. Mrs. Bell tries to play
peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   One day, as they got into the car anticipating another round in
the music wars, Frances commented that her third-grade class was
studying Bob Dylan. Mrs. Bell asked if she told the teacher that
her Daddy listens to Dylan, hoping that her daughter might now
recognize that Dylan was indeed special.
</P>
<P>
   Frances replied with disdain: ``Everybody's father listens to
Bob Dylan.''
</P>
<P>
   While on the subject of Bob Dylan, Stephen Tympanick thinks this
could be filed under ``you know you're old when ...'' He was at a
yard sale in the Hamptons, perusing the knicknacks, when he saw a
teen-age boy carrying an LP of Dylan's greatest hits.
</P>

   The boy joined his father and enthusiastically blurted: ``Look
Dad, I found a record by Jakob Dylan's father! I didn't know he was
a musician, too.''

AGENT SAYS PLAYERS WILL SUE TO PLAY IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Contending that the National Basketball Association
and USA Basketball are refusing to grant releases for players who
want to play overseas, Nick Van Exel of the Denver Nuggets, Marcus
Camby of the New York Knicks and several other players are expected
to sue the organizations this week, the players' agent said Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel, who wants to play the rest of the season in Europe,
will be the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. The agent, James Bryant,
said he may file a class action lawsuit, which could influence the
potential exodus of other NBA players to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   FIBA, the sport's world governing body, recently lifted a
restriction that allowed only two American players on European
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem has been getting clearance to play overseas,''
Bryant said. ``With offers being made, we have run into roadblocks
from the NBA and USA Basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant has not named a jurisdiction where the suit will be
filed.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Mishkin, the league's general counsel, disputed Bryant's
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's absolutely not true,'' Mishkin said. ``We've written to
FIBA and have said the players were free to pursue other employment
during the lockout as long as they return to honor their contracts
with their teams when the lockout ends. I can't imagine what the
dispute would be over.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bryant said, ``Their position is not as clear as they might
think,'' based on his reading of the league's rules pertaining to
players going overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Byrant, whose ProServ management company represents 10 NBA
players, not all of whom will be named in the lawsuit, said the
problem is that Van Exel would want to finish the season in Europe
_ even if the NBA lockout were lifted _ and then return to the
United States as a free agent next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel, who was traded from the Los Angeles Lakers to the
Nuggets in June, has one year remaining on his contract. Camby, who
was traded from Toronto to the Knicks last summer, also has one
year remaining on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nick wants to go to Denver, and Marcus wants to go New York,
but there is no game,'' Bryant said. ``We're looking at probably
playing three months over there. If the season is canceled, they
won't miss anything. But right now, we can't even respond to
offers.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Van Exel may be the first NBA player to legally challenge
the league regarding playing overseas, other marquee players have
threatened to go to Europe if the labor dispute continues. Michael
Olowokandi, the No. 1 pick in the draft, has said through his agent
that he is interested in playing in Europe rather than waiting for
the lockout to end and signing with the Los Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Portland's Damon Stoudamire is said to have received offers,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern has said all NBA players are
technically free agents during the lockout, but that all contracts
would go back into effect once the lockout ended. More than 220
players have contracts for the 1998-99 season and another 200 are
free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this is about is that the European teams simply do not
have the same flexibility as the NBA teams,'' said agent Keith
Glass, who represents more than a dozen players in Europe. ``They
don't have unlimited options. An NBA team can bring up as many guys
as they want during a season. In Europe, there are a limited number
of moves you can make.
</P>
<P>
   ``The player has to commit to the rest of the season. If they
don't, then the European team may not make that deal. Basically,
what Van Exel and Camby may be saying is: `Look, I want to go for
the year. I don't want to come back at your beck and call.' That's
probably what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   With no talks scheduled, the lockout enters what many observers
believe is the pivotal week in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Stern alluded to the second week of December as a
period in which both sides would have to be headed toward an
agreement to salvage a shortened season. While Stern has refused to
announce a firm deadline, the prospect for an imminent deal remains
slim.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the union held a conference call featuring about 100
players. Of the 18 players who spoke on the call, a union official
said, the dominant theme seemed to be scrapping the season if the
owners do not compromise on their current proposal.

PATAKI SIDESTEPS PICKETS OUTSIDE ABC TV STUDIOS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gov. George Pataki appeared Sunday on the ABC News
program ``This Week'' at the network's studios in Manhattan, which
have been the focal point of a labor dispute involving 2,200
broadcast technicians and other employees locked out by management
for nearly five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The union, the National Association of Broadcast Employees and
Technicians, has been able to discourage some public figures and
celebrities _ including Vice President Al Gore, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson and, most recently, boxer George Foreman _ from appearing
on ABC News programs since the lockout began on Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick McCarthy, a spokesman for Pataki, said the governor's
appearance did not indicate any position on the labor dispute and
that Pataki continued to hope for a speedy settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Pickets said the governor's car appeared to circle the block on
which the studio is located, West 66th Street, to find a door to
the building with the fewest pickets. Union members said there were
at least three pickets at the entrance when Pataki arrived and at
least four pickets at an exit when the governor left the studio.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said the governor ``entered a door where there were no
picketers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Pataki, you're crossing a picket line' and he just
did this,'' said Alicia Chenoa, 44, a picketing graphic artist,
demonstrating a small hand wave she said the governor made as he
entered the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a wimp! I mean, they case the place to find the fewest
people,'' she said.

in the lobby of a train station are hundreds of elderly men and
women in frayed, dirty clothes. In the icy weather they sleep in
shoddy tents of canvas or plastic, and they cook food scrounged
from garbage over open fires and use the streets or the canal for a
toilet. But these are not ordinary derelicts, and the streets are
not littered with broken wine bottles. Carrying on an ancient
Chinese tradition, these sorry-looking people have come from the
provinces with little money but an all-consuming mission: to
petition the supreme rulers for redress of heartfelt grievances _
from alleged thefts by corrupt local officials to pensions denied.

looking to better medical practice as an answer. The new remedy is

not warmly received back at CIA headquarters, intelligence
officials now say, and the agency killed his study, called a
National Intelligence Estimate. But today, the information gathered
by Pandolfi is part of various criminal and congressional
