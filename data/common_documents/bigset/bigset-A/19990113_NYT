RESENDING FOR FIX ON DAKICH FIRST NAME 
A HUMBLE START, PREMATURE END FOR JORDAN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the beginning: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan's ninth-grade coach cut him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His college coach kept him on a tight offensive leash. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's career at North Carolina ended in gloom. Indiana
University dumped the Tar Heels in the Sweet 16 round of the NCAA
Tournament. Told by Bobby Knight just before the game that Jordan
was his defensive assignment, somebody named Dan Dakich excused
himself, went to the locker-room john, threw up, and then held his
man to eight points. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Redemption for Jordan was expected to come in the 1984 NBA
draft, and did. Kinda. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Portland made a decision that lives in basketball infamy, taking
7-footer Sam Bowie with the second pick. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston also bypassed Jordan, but since the Rockets used the
first pick on Hakeem Olajuwon, history is much kinder. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A bad bunch of Bulls in Chicago then had Jordan fall their way,
except ... &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An up-and-coming Mavericks team from Dallas, on their way to a
first playoff appearance, played their worst game of the previous
season on Nov. 4, 1983, in Cleveland. The Cavaliers were awful, but
they trounced Dallas, 105-84. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, if the Mavericks had won that night,
Cleveland, not the Bulls, would have had the third draft choice in
the summer of '84. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's pick was owned by the Mavericks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next question. Knowing what we now know about the Mavericks'
draft history, would they have blown the Jordan pick? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes. At least, if they had heeded the astute advice of a former
Dallas sports page columnist. No name, please, but the guy has a
mustache and hooked nose spread across a radio face. Before that
draft, this idiot wrote the immortal words, ``the Mavericks need to
go big, bigger, biggest. Forget Jordan, just keep drafting big men
until you get it right.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, the Mavericks already had Ro Blackman, Derek Harper
and Brad Davis in the backcourt. How could Jordan be an improvement
on that? How indeed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All factors considered, it amounts to rather humble beginnings
for what would become The Greatest Show on Earth, sports-wise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This time, without doubt, Jordan means it. He's retiring. The
other time, he was just recharging batteries while seeking to
solve, very unsuccessfully, the mystery of the curveball. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now we all lose. The Bulls certainly, but who cares? The NBA
certainly, but who cares? But what baseball had last summer with
McGwire-Sosa is what sports fans have had for years every time the
Bulls tipped it off. Jordan wasn't about a game, a team, or a
league. In sports, Jordan was today's Babe Ruth. How many more
years or decades until we find tomorrow's Michael Jordan? If ever. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ending is hardly a surprise, and based on the current
troubled state of the NBA, maybe it's the perfect time to walk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But for those of us who thought Jerry-Jimmy was the mother of
all ego blunders in sports, at least for this era, the retirement
of Jordan is now the topper. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He does leave prematurely, with his game still intact, and the
probable reason centers on spite. Here's to you, Jerry Krause, and
you, too, Jerry Reinsdorf. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Krause is the Bulls' general manager. Over the years, he has
done an excellent job of building the Bulls around Jordan, but that
also was his downfall. Krause has never been comfortable with the
obvious _ Jordan is the show. Jordan is the one current Bulls'
player Krause did not put on the roster. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf is the owner who allowed harsh feeling between Jordan
and Krause to fester and grow for years. Blame him heavily. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Six world championships in eight seasons for Chicago, but with
each, the internal war escalated between Krause and Jordan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was last season, as the Bulls were headed for another
title, when Krause finally went off the deep end. ``Players don't
win world championships, organizations do,'' Krause said. He was
actually talking about the expected difficulty in re-signing
free-agent-to-be Scottie Pippen. But it was an insult to Jordan,
and Jordan knew it. So, be assured, did Krause. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pawn in their battle became coach Phil Jackson, Jordan's
guy. Krause constantly pushed for Jackson to retire. Jordan
repeatedly said if Jackson did, he would also quit. Jackson did.
Now Jordan will. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jordan performed his job better than anyone in NBA history.
Krause's front-office work complemented Jordan's greatness. How
could they not live happily ever after? Where was Reinsdorf when it
came time to personally put a muzzle on Krause? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's now a career for Michael Jordan, who, by the way,
the Mavericks could have used after all. &QL;

GILBERT M. HAGGERTY, 79, AIDE FOR 40 YEARS TO N.Y. TIMES EDITORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gilbert M. Haggerty, a skillful and good-humored aide to six
metropolitan editors at The New York Times, died on Sunday at his
home in Forked River, N.J. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   He had leukemia, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Haggerty, known as Gil, was the administrative assistant to the
metropolitan editor when he retired in 1984 after more than 40
years with The Times.
</P>
<P>
   For years, he sat near the metropolitan desk's successive chief
editors and their lieutenants, where he stayed calm while
simultaneously juggling a variety of tasks, from helping new
reporters and relaying editors' messages to the staff to sorting
through the daily torrent of incoming letters, news releases and
phone calls. His specialty was placating readers with a grievance.
</P>
<P>
   Haggerty was born in Manhattan, the son of Michael Haggerty, a
New York Times police and court reporter who retired in 1947 after
27 years with the newspaper. Gil Haggerty grew up on Staten Island,
where he graduated from St. Peter's School and then from
Augustinian Academy. Not long afterward, in 1938, he was hired by
The Times, initially as an office boy.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, he became an Army sergeant and served in a tank
destroyer battalion in Europe from six days after the Allied
invasion of northern France began in June 1944 until Germany
surrendered in May 1945. He earned five battle stars and returned
to The Times.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 57 years, Adrienne R. Haggerty;
two sons, Gilbert J., of Forked River and Joseph M., of Middletown,
N.J., who is national expansion marketing manager in The Times'
circulation department; two daughters, Judith Anne Glieden of
Lanoka Harbor, N.J., and Mary Rose Cummings of Staten Island, and
eight grandchildren.

   Britain: Law Lords to Rule on Pinochet
</P>
<P>
   Seven law lords, instead of the usual five, will decide whether
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, as former Chilean head of state, enjoys
immunity from arrest or must face extradition proceedings to put
him on trial in Spain for crimes against humanity. The hearing,
which starts Jan. 18, was prompted by the unprecedented setting
aside in December of an earlier judgment against the former
dictator because one judge concealed his involvement with Amnesty
International, a party to the case.

   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government has announced its

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Ican see him each time I walk down the hallway, the ball in his
hands, his head tilted up slightly at the basket, mouth barely open
with that famous tongue ready to sneak out to one corner, the fury
in those sparkling brown eyes telling you the shot, most certainly,
is going in.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan has been standing in this part of our house for
several years now. More accurately, a life-sized cardboard cutout
of Jordan peers out from a corner of my daughter's room, and I
can't begin to tell you the number of times in the first few months
he took up residence that a 6-6 Jordan replica scared the bejabbers
out of my wife and me, just the way the real thing must have taken
the breath away from Karl Malone when Jordan sneaked up from behind
and stole the ball in the final minute of Game 6 of the NBA Finals
last June at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   Over there on one wall of a kid's shrine to the icon of our
times _ between the poster of the original Dream Team, an
autographed photo of a younger Jenna and Michael, and a plastic
wall clock on which the upper half of No. 23's body remains fixed
as he drives for a dunk while the legs move back and forth, ticking
off each second _ hangs the image to remember.
</P>
<P>
   It is a glossy 8x10 print of the last shot of Jordan's NBA
career, right after he picked the Mailman's pocket and at the
precise moment he stabbed the final dagger into the hearts of the
Jazz and the entire state of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The photo shows Malone and John Stockton standing in the lane to
the right of the basket, Antoine Carr boxing out Dennis Rodman to
the left, and Bryon Russell _ the last victim, who had been beaten
by a stutter step right and a pull-up jumper from the head of the
key _ watching helplessly from the free-throw line with 5.6 seconds
frozen on the clock. Jordan's arm is perfectly extended, the ball
is splashing through the net, and so many pairs of hands are
clapped over shocked mouths in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls 87, Jazz 86.
</P>
<P>
   Our memories are filled with so many snapshots, from that bold
jumper out on the left wing launched by a nervy North Carolina
freshman to beat Georgetown for the 1982 NCAA championship, to the
shot over an anguished Craig Ehlo in 1989 that sank Cleveland in a
first-round playoff series, to that most dramatic exit in Salt Lake
City.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the end of an Air-a. Not just on the basketball court,
but all through our multimedia, interconnected, global village of a
modern society, where Jordan has become, quite likely, the most
recognizable person on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   I have ridden subway trains in Tokyo, walked through the palace
gardens of Versailles, toured Hitler's Eagles Nest at Berchtesgaden
and been inside mom-and-pop stores in frozen Norway where people
have worn his jersey or displayed his face on a poster. What's the
old saying that 900 million Chinese don't care? Well, on a visit to
the Great Wall last year, NBA commissioner David Stern met a young
girl who wanted to talk about the ``Team of the Red Ox.'' Da Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Our grandfathers saw the incomparable Babe Ruth. Our fathers saw
the unbeatable Rocky Marciano. We saw the virtually indescribable,
all-encompassing Jordan. Each generation has its enduring symbol in
the games we play and watch.
</P>
<P>
   There were the rim-rattling dunks. The clutch 3-pointers. The
pit-bull defense by which he sank in his teeth and wouldn't let go.
</P>
<P>
   There was the tongue. The smile. The Swoosh.
</P>
<P>
   From Nike to Gatorade, from batteries to breakfast cereal, he
raised the level of the celebrity pitchman to lofty, unprecedented
heights and, in the process, became so much more than a great
athlete. Just his silhouette _ on athletic clothing or a cologne
bottle _ is enough to drive millions in sales across the spectrum
of consumers in every culture in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody wants to be like Mike. He became more than a black man
who crossed over and appealed to a white corporate audience. He
seemed to transcend race and any other barriers. He was making
movies and playing basketball with cartoon characters like Bugs
Bunny and Daffy Duck, selling long-distance telephone service with
Tweety Bird. I tawt I taw a superstar.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the flamboyance in his game, what seemed to set
Jordan apart was an ability to carry himself with a kind of quiet
dignity in the eye of the hurricane. And for all of his clean,
happy, smiling image, what allowed him to stand above his peers on
the court was this: He was a cold-blooded killer.
</P>
<P>
   From the day he cried in Los Angeles as he first hugged the NBA
championship trophy to the evening five years later on Father's Day
when he sprawled out all alone on the floor of the United Center
locker room cradling a basketball, tearfully remembering his own
pop, the late James Jordan, he defined himself by winning.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls and basketball fans everywhere always enjoyed the show.
But the question remains whether enough of them _ kids, adults and
the players he leaves behind in the NBA _ paid attention to
Jordan's total commitment to winning.
</P>
<P>
   In the early part of his career, he learned what it took from
Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Isiah Thomas and used his own
tremendous inner pressure to turn those lessons, like coal, into
championship diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of his NBA career, Jordan was probably the
best athlete on the planet. But he won titles by becoming the best
basketball player. He committed himself to learning the complex
triangle offense of Tex Winter and embraced all of his teammates in
a complete game. He was no longer Superman leaping tall buildings
in a single bound, but more like a basketball Einstein, a genius at
work.
</P>
<P>
   The great Jerry West once said: ``Just when you really learn how
to play the game, it's time to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan understood in time and was probably at his most
impressive after an earlier 1{-year retirement to pursue a baseball
career. We wondered if he would tarnish his reputation after the
time spent swinging and missing at the curveball. But he returned
as less of an acrobat and more of a Swiss watchmaker who knows
every single thing about how the machinery ticks. He showed us his
accumulated wisdom, his smarts, his competitive nature. No one
wants to win more than him. At any time.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was suffering from the flu on the night of Game 5 of the
1997 NBA Finals in Salt Lake City and could barely stand up. Yet
all he did was score 38 points, including 15 in the fourth quarter,
to carry the Bulls. On Jordan's only trip into Houston last season,
the Bulls defeated the Rockets, and his buddy Charles Barkley
wanted a souvenir to remember what would prove to be their final
head-to-head game. He sent a ballboy into the Bulls' locker room to
ask for Jordan's shoes _ signed, of course. Michael promptly sent
the shoes back, autographed and also inscribed with the final
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``That S.O.B.,'' said Barkley. ``I should have known.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we should all have known Jordan meant it when he said last
summer that he'd had enough and was prepared to walk away. He
claims he never picked up a basketball after hitting that shot in
Utah and spent the past seven months playing golf, smoking cigars,
drinking wine and even acquiring a bit of a paunch.
</P>
<P>
   Did he do this to claim victory over the lords of the NBA, who
eventually beat down his side of the argument in the protracted
labor war and need him now more than ever to resell their game? Did
the killer finally find a way to score the ultimate win over Bulls
owner Jerry Reinsdorf and general manager Jerry Krause, who always
made the team's championship rides bumpy?
</P>
<P>
   Where does he turn now? What can he do to be fulfilled?
</P>
<P>
   It is not like he can become an ordinary citizen and take his
kids on an unhassled vacation to Disney World or even an unescorted
trip to the mall. He can retire from the Bulls and from the NBA.
But he can never retire from being Air Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   He left before and came back. And because we know that deep
inside he is happiest when he is playing basketball, that the court
is his refuge, there will always be hope that he will return once
more to prove something to himself and to shock us.
</P>
<P>
   As with the life-sized figure standing in the corner of a kid's
room, we had just gotten used to always having Michael Jordan
around.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
A basketball career will end, and a tenure hailed as among sports'
most transcendent will be over.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Jordan will retire from the NBA today, leaving a gaping
void behind. But more than his time in the Chicago Bulls' No. 23
will be history.
</P>
<P>
   An era in sports _ and in America, perhaps _ will end. And in
ways that go beyond the legends who have come before and will
surely come again, Jordan will stand, as the day leading up to his
farewell clearly showed, as a unique, towering sports icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is, to me, the greatest athlete that's ever played
sports,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``You say, `This guy
is an athlete; he has skills; he has strength; he has a tremendous
will to win.' In years to come, with the way we talk about (Joe)
DiMaggio, Babe Ruth, this guy has done the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Said former Detroit Pistons star Isiah Thomas, ``He was the
greatest of the greatest. He took basketball to heights we never
thought it could go.''
</P>
<P>
   The third player chosen in the 1984 NBA draft behind the
Rockets' Hakeem Olajuwon and Portland Trail Blazers footnote Sam
Bowie, Jordan became one of the most charismatic, compelling sports
figures ever and one of the world's most powerful celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   For the NBA, scarred by its six-month labor impasse and work
stoppage, the loss of its greatest hero comes as an ill-timed, if
inevitable, blow. Jordan had pledged to end his career if Phil
Jackson stepped aside as the Bulls' coach. And though Jordan had
refused to announce his departure during the lockout, only his
reticence on the topic gave rise to hope he might return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a blessing playing against a player like that,''
Rockets veteran Mario Elie said. ``When I have children, I can show
tapes and tell them, `This is the best player who ever touched a
basketball.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Wilt Chamberlain was a great player Jerry West. There
was no one in the NBA that had the impact like Michael Jordan. Even
if he was playing the worst team in the league, that game was going
to sell out. They just came to see Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans began to find out they wouldn't get another chance to see
him play late Monday as word spread that Jordan had chosen to
retire, leaving the NBA after its lockout similar to the way he
ended his baseball experiment in March 1995 as that sport was still
enduring its protracted strike.
</P>
<P>
   But more than simply choosing not to take part in the Bulls'
transition and the league's rushed, make-do season, Jordan will
leave with little else to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   The lines on the rsum are staggering. Jordan carried the Bulls
to six championships, winning the title in each of his last six
complete seasons. He won 10 NBA scoring championships and scored
31.5 points a game for his career, both NBA records. In total
points for a career, Jordan walks away behind only Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar and Chamberlain. Jordan was the league's Most Valuable
Player five times and the NBA Finals MVP six times.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was named to the All-NBA first team 10 times and made the
league's defensive first team on nine occasions. He won two Olympic
gold medals (one before his rookie season) and was All-Star Game
MVP three times, Rookie of the Year in 1985 and slam-dunk champion
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to turning pro after three seasons at North Carolina, he
won an NCAA championship _ sinking the game-winner against
Georgetown as a freshman in 1982 _ and was a two-time selection as
National Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   There are snapshots of sublime moments. His machine-gun,
between-the-legs dribble against Larry Bird in his 63-point playoff
effort vs. the Celtics in 1986. The foul-line leap to win a
slam-dunk contest. The reverse-direction dunk over Patrick Ewing.
The playoff-series winning jumper against Craig Ehlo and Cleveland.
The six 3-pointers in the NBA Finals against the Trail Blazers. His
Game 5, 38-point triumph over the flu and the Jazz in 1997. And his
final-minute Game 6 dominance of Utah to claim his last title this
past June.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the highlights, awards and records, Jordan was
endlessly respected by his peers. It was as if the videos and
commercials could not capture what fellow players saw when sharing
the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes to every category,'' Lakers forward Robert Horry said.
``If you had to rank on a scale of one to 10, he had 10s. Smarts,
to knowing the game, ability, agility, anything you wanted to say,
he was No. 1 on the list. If you ever played against him and you
ran into him, it was like running into a brick wall. He was strong.
He was smart. He was talented.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you step on the court with Michael, you think, `Michael
Jordan _ the best.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's exit will be just another part of his amazing legacy.
He not only went out on top with his sixth championship, he
departed as the league's undisputed best player even to his final
game. When Jordan posed for just a moment as his shot defeated the
Jazz for last season's title, his freeze frame seemed to capture a
final, definitive moment in sports history.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't write a better script than that,'' Elie said. ``The
guy did everything. He accomplished everything. That's the way to
end your career, on a sweet jumper to win the championship. That's
a storybook ending.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the NBA's icons, only Bill Russell went out in similar
style, announcing his retirement after leading the Celtics to their
11th championship in 13 years. But even that did not make him his
era's unquestioned best player. Because of the presence of
Chamberlain, Russell was a first-team All-NBA selection only three
times.
</P>
<P>
   While Russell was hailed as the quintessential team player and
leader, Jordan holds that distinction for his generation in
addition to towering above his sport as its brightest individual
star.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of great players,'' said Atlanta Hawks
coach Lenny Wilkens, a Hall of Famer as a player and coach. ``He
(Jordan) combined the best of everybody I've ever seen. He did it
all, on and off the court.''
</P>
<P>
   While his talent on the court was unquestioned, a rare
combination of athletic gifts and powerful will, it was off the
court where Jordan became an icon beyond sports.
</P>
<P>
   More like the singers and movie stars of other generations,
Jordan changed style. He made baldness fashionable. Shorts were
made long and baggy, sneakers produced in multicolored, often
garish splashes.
</P>
<P>
   As society adopted much of his personal style, companies far
beyond his chosen profession clamored for his Midas touch, making
him a prolific salesmen for everything from hamburgers, hot dogs
and cereal to cologne, underwear, batteries and long-distance
service.
</P>
<P>
   It is said Jordan can be in no public place for longer than 30
minutes before being overrun and overwhelmed by his supporters.
Like teen-agers pursuing Elvis Presley or the Beatles, fans have
risked their safety to touch the team bus that carried him.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis died. The Beatles broke up. Russell, Chamberlain,
Abdul-Jabbar, Bird and Magic Johnson all retired. Icons from Ruth
and DiMaggio through Muhammad Ali left their pastimes to the next
generation.
</P>
<P>
   But there has perhaps never been a sports star as clearly in
command of his time in his own time. It has long been understood
that one of sport's legends was passing through. And after today,
what might be the most celebrated, cherished career of them all
will be a memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will never be another Michael Jordan,'' Wilkens said.
``There will be great players who come through this league. But
never another Jordan.''

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the NFL's No. 1 draft choice playing for its 30th-best team,
Keyshawn Johnson felt compelled to speak out _ or rather, write it
out.
</P>
<P>
   Just Give Me The Damn Ball! was his first literary effort, and
in it he suggested that 63 pass receptions amounted to little when
the New York Jets were 1-15 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Jets went 12-4 and Johnson caught 83 passes for
1,131 yards. Now, they're heading into the AFC Championship Game,
thanks in large part to Johnson's efforts in their playoff opener,
a 34-24 dispatching of Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Jaguars, Johnson caught nine passes for 121 yards
and a touchdown, and he rushed for 28 yards on two end arounds, one
of which went for a 10-yard score.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets gave him the ball repeatedly. When they didn't, he took
it anyway. He recovered a fumble after chasing the play for 60
yards. And on Jacksonville's final try for the end zone, he lined
up at safety and intercepted a Hail Mary fling.
</P>
<P>
   He also blocked ferociously on numerous downfield plays.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is 26 but not too young to contemplate his legacy.
``People are going to say that I'm one of the most physical
receivers in the game,'' he says. ``Most receivers, all they care
about is catching touchdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   His performance Sunday had echoes of mythology, so complete and
so contrarian in this era of specialization. To Baby Boomers and
younger, this was Mount Olympus-at-the-Meadowlands, part Jim
Thorpe, part Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   But actually, it was Jack Manders who previously put together
this combination of playoff dominance _ a receiving touchdown, a
rushing touchdown, a fumble recovery and an interception. Manders
did it in 1937, when versatility was not so rare a virtue.
</P>
<P>
   Humility is still not in Johnson's expansive repertoire. He is
not happy unless the key player is Keyshawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a team player, but I am an individual first,'' he says.
``I am going to shine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have electricity. My electricity can make everyone
soar. I want the football. I want to block. I want to win. I want
to do it all, and I can. And I have to be the No. 1 guy with the
football, not No. 2 or No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a rookie, I had to demand the ball because we were losing
and they weren't getting it to me,'' he says. ``I don't have to
demand the ball with these coaches. They know and they recognize
talent, and they know how to exploit defenses. They know what it's
going to take to beat people.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Johnson still pleads for the football, arguing that at
6-3 and 212 pounds, he can reach just about any pass, and if he
can't catch it, he'll make sure no opponent does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keyshawn lobbies a lot,'' says Jets quarterback Vinny
Testaverde, the AFC's leading passer. ``But it's a high-percentage
play with him. If you throw it up high enough, he's going to catch
it, and if it's a bad throw, he's going to knock it down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets tolerate Johnson's unabashed me-first attitude because
he's possibly the hardest worker on the team.
</P>
<P>
   He slept only four hours the night before Sunday's game, and he
was at the stadium at 7:30 a.m., long before any other players. His
adrenalin count must have been off the chart. Throughout the game,
he was telling teammates, ``I'm hot, I'm hot today.''
</P>
<P>
   As Testaverde puts it, ``Keyshawn makes plays, all kinds of
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   He will need to make lots of them Sunday in Denver if the Jets
are to return to the Super Bowl for the first time in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is not talking down the Broncos, who bashed Miami 38-3.
``From what they showed against Miami, they are not beatable,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets figure their only chance to upset the defending champs
is in a shootout. The Broncos' one weakness is their secondary, so
the Jets will try to make maximum use of Johnson, hoping he can
break loose for big plays.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, not everyone appreciates Johnson's cockiness.
Much has been made of his frosty relationship with fellow receiver
Wayne Chrebet, whom Johnson called ``the team mascot'' in his book.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't like each other from the start,'' Chrebet says.
``Long before the book. He was a young kid throwing his weight
around. I don't like guys saying, `I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna do
that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Chrebet (75 receptions for 1,083 yards) and Johnson have
downplayed their dislike for each other. They have neighboring
lockers, and they display no open hostility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get asked more questions about Keyshawn than about myself,''
Chrebet says.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson empathizes with him on that point. ``What was being
talked about my first year is being talked about now,'' he says.
``You'd think it would be over with.''
</P>
<P>
   But in New York, the tabloid city, old feuds are slow to die.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Johnson and Chrebet are much alike in their
approach to the game. Both are fearless over-the-middle
pass-catchers, while neither has the speed to be a long-ball
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not the fastest group of wide receivers I've played
with,'' Testaverde says, ``but heart-wise and hands-wise they're up
there.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you give either one of them the ball, they can make the
most of it.

 McGWIRE'S 70TH HOME RUN BALL SELLS FOR $3 MILLION, BLEMISHES AND (Eds: SUBS to UPDATE with auction house's commission added to sale
price, ADDS identity of Ozersky's girlfriend.) 
(See also BBO-AUCTION-MCGWIRE)

 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To begin with, this baseball that has been called the
Hope Diamond of sports collectibles, the Holy Grail, the fan's
equivalent of a Picasso or a Renoir is not even in mint condition.
It's defaced in two places, one where Mark McGwire's bat bashed the
ball for his record-setting 70th and final home run of last season.
The other bruise occurred when the ball hit a wall in a left-field
upper-deck box in Busch Stadium in St. Louis. And rumor had it that
someone was going to pay $1 million or more for this used ball?
</P>
<P>
   That was absolutely ridiculous. It defied common sense. So, of
course, someone last night paid $3 million for it ($300,000 of
which goes to the auction house in commission.)
</P>
<P>
   In a baseball memorabilia auction in the Theater in Madison
Square Garden, the bidding for this first of 41 items began at
$500,000 and arose in increments of $50,000 and $100,000 _ the
large crowd buzzing as it did _ to that king's ransom. The
recipient of the ball was ``Anonymous,'' who was bidding by phone,
perhaps with a team of therapists at his side.
</P>
<P>
   The ball was struck on Sept. 27, the last day of the season and
McGwire's final at-bat, against Carl Pavano pitching for the Expos
against the Cardinals. It was nine homers beyond Roger Maris'
single-season record and 10 past the Babe. No. 70 was recovered in
that left-field box by a stocky, 26-year-old research scientist in
St. Louis named Phil Ozersky, who stands to take home all but about
$300,000 of the bid _ the auction house has to make a living, too.
Ozersky, sitting with his girlfriend, Amanda Abbott, barely uttered
a smile. Maybe he was too stunned, since he earns $30,000 a year in
the lab.
</P>
<P>
   This ball, which was encased, as were the others in the auction,
in glass, may very well drip with sentimental value for one so
inclined for such things.
</P>
<P>
   But on close observation it looks like any other of the 70,000
major league baseballs used last season _ white horsehide and red
stitching _ and one that you could pick up in any sporting goods
for $9.95.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 70th home run ball is the most valuable sports artifact in
history,'' said Arlan Ettinger, the president of Guernsey's, the
Manhattan auction house running the event. He was also the one who
described the ball as the Hope Diamond, the Holy Grail, etc. He
might have added the Honus Wagner 1910 baseball card, which sold at
auction in 1996 for a sports collectibles record at the time of a
paltry $640,500 to an anonymous buyer.
</P>
<P>
   In the auction program, condition of McGwire ball No. 70 is
described as very clean, but with ``Two semi-circular marks
approximately 1/8 (of an inch) in diameter in clear area. Slight
smudge on lettering `Center' (Cushion Cork Center) and `s' (in
Rawlings logo.)''
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky had attended the game that fateful night with about a
hundred people from his company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just went to see a game,'' he said. ``I never dreamed of
catching a home run ball. I'd never caught one before, and I've
been to many games.''
</P>
<P>
   So he's sitting up there enjoying things when suddenly this
missile is heading in his direction, and arrives in his group. One
of his fellows gets his hand on the ball, but it ricochets to the
back wall and then bounces under a metal bench.
</P>
<P>
   Young Ozersky then reaches down and plucks up the ball and the
rest is hysteria. He got an agent, he got a lawyer, he's made so
many media appearances for his 107 days and 15 minutes of fame that
on the morning of the auction he was an hour and a half late for an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   If Ozersky is somewhat caught up in his brief prominence, he is
no financial dunce. The man who caught McGwire's 62nd _ the homer
that broke the record held by Roger Maris _ gave it back to the
slugger for some bats, balls and a jersey. Ozersky was able to
figure out _ maybe with the help of a newly acquired accountant _
that $50 worth of equipment was less than the estimated $1 million
plus.
</P>
<P>
   Others who experienced windfalls from McGwire's retrieved homers
Nos. 63, 67 and 68 suffered in comparison to Ozersky. The highest
of those three went for an embarrassing $50,000. Also sold was
Sammy Sosa's 66th and final homer in what was a remarkable slugging
tandem with McGwire last season. Sosa's ball went for $150,000.
Also up for bidding was a pair of McGwire's red ankle-high cleats
that were worn in a game last season.
</P>
<P>
   What size are they? Ettinger was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky's ball, however, was the star of the evening. The now
former proprietor of it said he plans to give some auction money to
his parents for retirement, some he'll save for his children when
he has them (and, presumably, a wife) and other money he will
donate to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding home run ball No. 70, the auction program also notes:
``The current owner of the baseball (that is, Ozersky) retains the
right to produce 70 Cibachrome prints and 7,000 posters of the
baseball, both numbered and signed.''
</P>
<P>
   A poster of that defaced baseball would match perfectly the
couch in my living room. Where do I line up to buy it?

MANFRED L. KARNOVSKY, 80, BLOOD-CELL RESEARCHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Manfred L. Karnovsky, a biochemist who cast new light on the
way white blood cells fight off bacteria, died on Jan. 7 at Mount
Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. A resident of Cambridge, he was
80 and had worked at Harvard University for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   His research showed how white blood cells use oxygen to
strengthen their defenses against bacterial intruders. He was also
an expert in the biochemistry of sleep. With Prof. John
Pappenheimer, he advanced the biochemical study of sleep-inducing
substances in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   At his death he was the Harold T. White Professor Emeritus of
Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology in the department
of biochemistry. Karnovksy twice served as department chairman,
held the endowed White chair from 1965 to 1989 and published his
final research paper just last year.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, in donating money to create Manfred Karnovsky
Fellowships for graduate students in the division of medical
sciences, he said: ``I specifically want to support graduate
students because they do the research work. They do the
investigations that lead to publications.''
</P>
<P>
   Manfred Leslie Karnovsky, a native of Johannesburg, graduated
from the University of Witwatersrand in 1940 and received a
master's degree there in 1942. He obtained a doctorate in organic
chemistry in 1947 from the University of Cape Town and joined
Harvard the next year. He was a fellow of the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Karnovsky is survived by his wife, Ann Rosenblum Karnovsky;
a son, Daniel P., of Boston; a brother, Prof. Morris Karnovsky of
Newton, Mass.; a sister, Helene, of Sydney, Australia, and two
grandchildren.

   The Answer Man &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ MIKE McCURRY, the former White House press secretary,
is still taking questions. But Tuesday night they came not from
reporters but from an invitation-only crowd that included authors
GAY TALESE, LILLIAN ROSS and GEORGE PLIMPTON.
</P>
<P>
   The first question from the audience at the question-and-answer
session, organized by the New Yorker and held at Michael's
restaurant, on West 55th Street near the Avenue of the Americas,
came from someone who could get a subpoena to force an answer:
Manhattan District Attorney ROBERT MORGENTHAU.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau observed that Independent Counsel KENNETH STARR, the
, began with a reputation as ``a pretty reasonable fellow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he goes and violates every rule in the book,'' Morgenthau
said. ``What accounted for the big change in Ken Starr?''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said, ``Your opinion, in and of itself, counts for a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment later he added: ``Starr was not seen as somebody you
had to do combat with. It seems to me he is an enormously righteous
person and a pious person. I don't mean that in a pejorative sense.
But clearly, it's now become a personal crusade that has clouded
his judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends for Lunch &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LESLEY STAHL's Ladies' Lunch Group does not always get together
at lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, for example, the group (a six-year-old
confederation that Ms. Stahl said began when she and a few friends
``went through the newspapers and picked names out'') gathered at
Elaine's, the celebrity watering hole on the Upper East Side. The
occasion was a party celebrating Ms. Stahl's memoir, ``Reporting
Live'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), which covers everything from her days as
a Watergate reporter for CBS to her present job as a correspondent
for ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Who is in her group? In alphabetical order, the ladies are:
ELLEN FUTTER, president of the American Museum of Natural History;
LINDA FAIRSTEIN, head of the sex crimes unit of the Manhattan
district attorney's office; JURATE KAZICKAS, a freelance writer;
ANNA QUINDLEN, an author; ESTHER NEWBERG, a literary agent; LYNN
SHERR, a correspondent for the ABC News magazine ``20/20''; FAY
WATTLETON, former president of Planned Parenthood, and Judge KIMBA
WOOD of U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   They get together once a month and talk about ``everything,''
Ms. Sherr said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stahl likes her lunch groups. This is one of three she
belongs to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's embarrassing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   No Handouts Here &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is the administration of New Jersey GOV. CHRISTIE WHITMAN taking
a page from City Hall in New York?
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration banned news conferences and
demonstrations on the steps last summer in a security crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Capitol in Trenton Tuesday, officials moved to stop
CURTIS FISHER, the executive director of the New Jersey Public
Interest Research Group, from passing out leaflets about an energy
deregulation bill.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists like Fisher have long contributed to the hubbub in the
hallways as they try to influence lawmakers before important votes
are taken.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday was the first time in memory that officials had
tried to stop the arm-twisting.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher he said that he had a permit to distribute the leaflets.
But RICHARD LA ROSSA, the executive director of the State Capitol
Joint Management Commission, which is responsible for the building
and the grounds, said Fisher had gone beyond the ``confines of the
permit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People who worked in the building were complaining,'' he said.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The classic Michael Jordan story? Probably the
one about how he wrote the Gettysburg Address on the back of an
envelope on a train.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan's most memorable performance? ``The Ed Sullivan
Show'' in 1964, when the first U.S. appearance by Michael, Paul,
George and Ringo stopped crime in New York City for a night.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan's greatest team? The Nina, the Pinta and the
Santa Maria, with which he discovered America.
</P>
<P>
   The title of Michael Jordan's book? ``Origin of the Species,''
on his theory of organic evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan's most memorable shot? That 6-iron on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who is scheduled to announce his retirement today, will
go from basketball to the hall of the immortals, where he will mix
gracefully with the icons of Western culture.
</P>
<P>
   And dunk on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Lincoln, Christopher Columbus, Charles Darwin and Alan
Shepard may be dead, The Beatles long since splintered. Few of us
can say we saw Babe Ruth, Elvis Presley or FDR in the flesh. Last
year, we lost Frank Sinatra, Roy Rogers, Tom Bradley and Harry
Caray.
</P>
<P>
   Heroes get harder to find. But we'll always have Jordan. When
our parents or grandparents say, ``I saw the Babe hit a home run,''
we'll always be able to answer, ``I saw Michael drive the lane.''
</P>
<P>
   Casual sports fans can be forgiven for asking if he was that
good, that great. So many ``superstars'' turn out to be products of
unmatchable hype, or turn out to be secretly flawed. Didn't Mickey
Mantle drink too much, and wasn't Magic Johnson a playboy?
</P>
<P>
   In a time when there are few absolutes, Jordan was one. He was
that good, that great.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   --Extraordinary skills refined by hard work: Jordan, who once
failed to make his high school team and was only the No. 3 pick in
the 1984 NBA draft, went on to be the Rookie of the Year as well as
a five-time league Most Valuable Player and a record 10-time
scoring leader.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody had his combination of talents -- the ability to freeze a
defender with the threat of a 20-foot jump shot, to blow past the
poor opponent with explosive acceleration, and to finish the play
with a sleight-of-hand layup or a powerful dunk. He also made the
league's All-Defense Team year after year.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it was that Jordan aimed high. It didn't matter that in
his 1993-95 foray into baseball, he fell short of the major
leagues. That was an admirable misadventure. He looked for a
challenge the only place he could -- beyond basketball.
</P>
<P>
   When he failed at baseball, he came back to basketball and
dominated as if he'd never been away.
</P>
<P>
   --Winning: Let this be a lesson to talented young players -- the
Lakers' Kobe Bryant leaps to mind -- who believe individuality is
the way to the Wheaties box. What set Jordan apart from Wilt
Chamberlain and Julius Erving and a handful of other spectacular
players was that Jordan's teams won championship after
championship, and he often made the decisive shots.
</P>
<P>
   He won an NCAA championship with North Carolina, two Olympic
gold medals, six NBA titles with the Chicago Bulls. He capped his
college career in his first year with the title-winning 17-footer
for the Tar Heels in '82, and capped his pro career with the
title-winning 18-footer for the Bulls last June.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls won the NBA crown in every one of Jordan's complete
seasons in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   --Style: Some players sink a big shot and then taunt their
opponents or roar into the baseline camera. Jordan would shrug. He
was so cool about it.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost as if he willed it. His 38 points in 44 minutes in
Game 5 of the '97 NBA Finals victory over the Utah Jazz, while
playing with a case of the flu so debilitating he had to be
practically carried to the bench in the fourth quarter, was the the
closest thing we'll see to real heroism on a basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   Style? Jordan literally set the style for the sport. His fashion
statement, the baggy shorts, became universal. Now we laugh at old
clips of Magic and Larry Bird in their short shorts.
</P>
<P>
   --Commercial appeal: Jordan endorsed Nike; Nike promoted Jordan.
No African-American athlete ever enjoyed the influence with the
predominantly white buying public that Jordan has.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nike announced it will continue to honor its contract
with Jordan, the price of Nike stock fell 5.4 percent Tuesday on
news of his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan maintained his broad popularity in part by avoiding
personal scandal and controversy.
</P>
<P>
   An acknowledged penchant for high-stakes casino gambling never
tarnished him; the conspiracy theory that linked gambling to his
father's murder didn't fly. Sidestepping controversy over Nike's
pricing and labor practices wasn't particularly noble, but it's
hard to say any athlete or entertainer would do better in the same
position since none has ever attained it.
</P>
<P>
   --Timing: Jordan didn't revive the NBA; Magic and Bird had
already done that. Michael merely taught it to dance again.
</P>
<P>
   Merely? Fortune magazine calculated that Jordan's popularity was
responsible for $165 million in NBA ticket sales and $366 million
in TV and merchandise revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Now we'll see if that revenue stream dries up without him.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan's most clever quote? After Lady Astor groused,

AFTER LOSING $6 MILLION, PUBLIC THEATER TO CLOSE `ON THE TOWN'
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Faced with faltering ticket sales for ``On the
Town,'' the Joseph Papp Public Theater said on Tuesday that it
would close the production on Sunday at a loss of an estimated $6
million.
</P>
<P>
   George C. Wolfe, the artistic director of the Public and the
show's director, announced the decision to the cast at the Gershwin
Theater late Tuesday afternoon. After the final matinee, it will
have played 65 performances and 37 previews.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by the theater, Wolfe said he had hoped
a recent advertising campaign emphasizing some of the show's good
reviews would ``surmount the annual January doldrums on Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This unfortunately was not the case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The closing notice for ``On the Town'' brings to an end an
18-month tale surrounding the show, a 1944 musical that tells the
story of three sailors on a 24-hour leave in wartime New York.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe first staged the musical in August 1997 at the Delacorte
Theater in Central Park, where it received mixed reviews. Most
critics faulted that production's weak dance sequences, a fact many
veterans pointed to as an ominous sign for any Broadway prospects
for the show.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the weak reviews, Wolfe pushed on with plans for a
Broadway run, hiring a series of choreographers and eventually
booking the Gershwin, the largest theater on Broadway, for an
open-ended run. Wolfe himself was slowed by kidney failure and a
subsequent kidney transplant last March.
</P>
<P>
   The show finally opened in November, three days late, to
lukewarm reviews. Ticket sales soon decreased, and by late
December, the producers had bought air time to broadcast slick,
expensive television advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   They did not help. Last week, the show saw its weekly gross
sales dip to a paltry $255,653, a figure that represented a loss of
about $200,000. For Wolfe, the acclaimed director of such Tony
Award-winning productions as ``Bring In da Noise, Bring In da
Funk'' and ``Angels in America,'' the show's closing marked an
unexpected, and personal, defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a joyous experience working with all the talented
creators, designers and performers associated with `On the Town,'
he said in a statement. ``I thank them for their commitment.''

WHITMAN SETS APRIL 15 FOR PROPERTY TAX PLAN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov. Christie Whitman asked state lawmakers
Tuesday to enact her proposed five-year, $1 billion property tax
relief package by April 15 so homeowners can get their first rebate
check by Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Republican and Democratic lawmakers applauded the plan, which
Whitman outlined Tuesday in her fifth annual address to a joint
session of the state Legislature. The proposal would provide an
average rebate check of $120 to homeowners this year and an average
of $600 annually beginning in the fifth year. Tenants would receive
an average of $100 annually under the program when it is fully
phased in.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitman acknowledged that using state budget dollars to pay
for property tax rebates in future years would require ``fiscal
discipline from those of us in Trenton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiscal discipline means being very cautious about any new
spending programs,'' she said. ``Fiscal discipline means constantly
reminding ourselves that the No. 1 priority is helping you, the
taxpayer. The fiscal discipline we show today will deliver a check
to you tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratis lawmakers expressed concern about the long-term
fiscal implications of the property tax rebate plan. Others
questioned the fairness of making the rebates available even to the
state's wealthiest residents.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other new initiatives that the governor presented
Tuesday focused on education, health care and open space, as well
as an issue that is a concern of a growing number of middle-class
families: caring for chronically ill elderly relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In her 35-minute address at the recently renovated War Memorial
building here, Whitman called for imposing tougher standards on new
teachers, offering cash incentives to landowners who donate open
space or farmland to the state or private land trusts, hiring more
park maintenance workers, and expanding the program providing
health insurance to uninsured children.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state is expected to end the current fiscal year
with a budget surplus between $800 million and $1 billion, most of
the governor's plans would require modest or no spending increases
or would be paid for from existing funds or windfalls, like the
tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Although Whitman defeated former Gov. Jim Florio in 1993 with
the enthusiastic support of the National Rifle Association, she
disappointed some gun owners and the gun lobby Tuesday. She
announced that she would propose legislation requiring that every
gun sold in New Jersey include either a safety lock or the new
``smart gun'' technology, preventing anyone other than the gun's
owner from firing the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want one more gun sold in this state without built-in
protection for our children,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitman is likely to face a battle from some lawmakers over
the gun legislation, particularly from Assembly Speaker Jack
Collins, a fellow Republican. He was among a handful of lawmakers
who did not applaud when she talked about the gun bill.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said later that he would be reluctant to impose
requirements on gun owners before the ``smart gun'' technology was
widely available.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats took credit Tuesday for Whitman's decision to
make property tax relief the centerpiece of her address.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Whitman cut state income tax rates by 30
percent, but polls showed that voters did not give her much credit
for the tax cuts during her hard-fought 1997 re-election campaign.
Whitman won re-election, but narrowly, in part because voters
complained that she did not do enough to bring down the state's
property tax rates, the highest in the nation. They also complained
about auto insurance, which Whitman addressed last year but did not
mention in Tuesday's speech.

PATAKI INAUGURAL TEAM TOLD TO DISCLOSE COSTS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A ruling Tuesday by the state's highest court
forces Gov. George Pataki's supporters to disclose detailed
expenses paid by his 1995 inaugural and transition organizations,
information they have fought for four years to keep secret.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, by the Court of Appeals, is the latest in a long
string of court losses for associates of the governor, who have
opposed a bid by the majority Democrats in the state Assembly to
learn how the two organizations raised and spent more than $2.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals refused to hear the Pataki team's appeal,
meaning that orders by two lower courts to turn over the
information stand. With no higher state court to appeal to, the
transition and inaugural organizations have 15 days to provide the
information to the Assembly Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision deals specifically with $60,000 in credit
card charges. The two groups had given only a general description
of the charges and had not said who made each one. The Assembly
Democrats won the right Tuesday to see the credit card receipts.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats said Tuesday they had no idea what they would find
in the data. ``What we've been trying to do for four years now is
just plain public disclosure, and this is a big step in that
direction,'' said Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for Assembly
Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling also gives the Democrats the right to take sworn
testimony from Charles Gargano, who was Pataki's chief fund-raiser
in 1994 and headed the inaugural team. He is now the state
commissioner of economic development. Ms. Lynch said it was not
clear whether the Assembly would call Gargano to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McKeon, the governor's press secretary, said of
Tuesday's ruling: ``This has been a politically motivated case from
the very beginning, and it still is today. Nevertheless, we will
comply.''
</P>
<P>
   In late 1994, after Pataki defeated Gov. Mario Cuomo, the
governor-elect's aides and supporters formed a corporation to pay
for his lavish, three-day inaugural festivities, which cost $1.6
million, and another to finance a transition team, which spent
$900,000.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Pataki said the organizations would make full
disclosure of their finances and would abide by the rules governing
campaign fund-raising, although there was no legal requirement that
they do so. But after he took office, the two corporations declined
to make their records public, and it was disclosed that some
corporate sponsors gave far more than the $5,000 limit on corporate
campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Not until July 1996 did the organizations, under court order,
release the names of contributors and the amounts they gave, which
showed that the total raised was much higher than administration
officials had said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money came from corporations and business people
whose interests were regulated by the state or who were seeking
state contracts, and the records showed that many corporate
sponsors had given far more than the $5,000 limit on corporate
campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   It was also disclosed that many of the governor's advisers
collected salaries from the transition fund, including some who
failed to disclose the income on the forms they filed with the
state Ethics Commission, as required by law.
</P>
<P>
   Later court rulings forced the release of most information on
how the money was spent.

JORDAN TRULY ONE FOR THE AGES AS HE SOARS INTO PANTHEON OF HEROES

   LOS ANGELES -- The classic Michael Jordan story? Probably the
one about how he wrote the Gettysburg Address on the back of an
envelope on a train.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan's most memorable performance? ``The Ed Sullivan
Show'' in 1964, when the first U.S. appearance by Michael, Paul,
George and Ringo stopped crime in New York City for a night.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan's greatest team? The Nina, the Pinta and the
Santa Maria, with which he discovered America.
</P>
<P>
   The title of Michael Jordan's book? ``Origin of the Species,''
on his theory of organic evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan's most memorable shot? That 6-iron on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who is scheduled to announce his retirement today, will
go from basketball to the hall of the immortals, where he will mix
gracefully with the icons of Western culture.

IT'S A WEEK TO MAKE SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With one half-court shot by Adam Spanich against
Oregon last week, USC's basketball team seeped into national
prominence with exposure on nearly every sports highlight show.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the Trojans turn out to be more than a one-night
story will be determined in the next seven days, when USC faces a
critical juncture of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have a rare three-game Pacific-10 Conference
homestand against Stanford, California and UCLA. The Cardinal and
Bruins are ranked in the top 15, and the Bears are hovering just
outside the top 25.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Trojans are one of the conference's surprise teams
with a 10-3 record, how they fare in the next three games could
play a significant role in their chances of making the NCAA
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first got our schedule, I looked at these games
first,'' center Brian Scalabrine said. ``I looked at that and I
said that we will make or break our season here.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine actually believes the Trojans are entering a
four-game stretch of critical games, because USC follows up its
homestand with a trip to Seattle to play Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really need these four games in a row,'' Scalabrine said.
</P>
<P>
   That might be wishful thinking, but the games are particularly
important because the Trojans already dropped a home game against
Arizona, and can probably only afford one more loss at home.
</P>
<P>
   USC had a chance to make up for the Arizona loss by sweeping the
Oregon schools last weekend. But after Spanich's unlikely 3-pointer
beat the Ducks, the Trojans lost in overtime at Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel there's pressure every game, but it really started when
we lost to Arizona,'' Scalabrine said. ``It's three home games and
we have to win our home games. It's big.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to that to the Trojans 0-2 record against top-10 teams
(Kansas, Arizona), and the trio of games become even more important
to their psyche and power ratings. Two wins would be considered
good, and winning three. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweeping will be what we want to do. If we win three games,
we're like a tournament team,'' Scalabrine said. ``We've proved
ourselves. We'd have beaten top-ranked teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be positive if we get two out of three. One out of three
would be a bad week for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The thought of emphasizing games on the schedule flies in the
face of everything USC coach Henry Bibby believes in, so he
naturally has little to say other than he looks forward to playing
Stanford on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that's the wrong question to ask me. I'm not looking
at three games. I'm looking at one game. Hopefully, we can get
Stanford,'' Bibby said. ``It's important that we have these games.
It doesn't matter where we play them because they're all good
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these games will be more interesting for the Trojans
than any other team in the Pac-10, because it will show whether
they have homecourt advantage against the conference's elite. USC
is 7-1 at the Sports Arena, despite averaging a conference-low
2,926.
</P>
<P>
   After losing to Arizona last week, the Trojans wondered if they
receive the same treatment from officials that teams like Stanford
and Arizona do when they play at home before sellout crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at home, we don't get much respect because we're not a
big basketball school,'' Spanich said. ``You saw what happened
against Arizona. Sometimes, it's like playing five on eight, and
that's not knocking the refs, but it seems like we don't get a lot
of calls. Maybe because we're not expected to win those games.
</P>
<P>
   ``These games are huge. This is what we've got to do to help
make our season. We've got to defend the homecourt. We've got to
get that mentality for these games.''
</P>
<P>
   USC, tied for second in the Pac-10 at 2-2, also needs Spanich
and Elias Ayuso to find their shooting touch.
</P>
<P>
   While Scalabrine, power forward Sam Clancy, forward Jeff
Trepagnier and point guard Brandon Granville have solidified their
roles, the shooting- guard position has been inconsistent. Spanich
and Ayuso made 11 of their 15 3-point attempts in USC's 85-84
victory over Oregon. Two nights later, they were 4 for 16 in a
69-66 loss to Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we come through, it controls everything. (Ayuso) and I are
the X-factor,'' Spanich said. ``It's been a tough year for us, the
way we've played.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in case some of the Trojans don't realize the importance of
this stretch, Scalabrine said he will probably bring it up before
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that the team thinks these three games will make
or break the season,'' he said. ``I'm gonna talk to the senior
leaders . . . and stress the importance of these games. If we can
win these games, we can be a legit team.''

AIDS IS STILL HERE, BUT DONORS VANISH
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By LYNDA RICHARDSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Gay Men's Health Crisis announced in
December that it would no longer hold a popular annual fund-raising
event on Fire Island, the move did more than end the
public-relations nightmare that the Morning Party had become.
</P>
<P>
   While the spectacle of merrymakers collapsing from drug
overdoses and being arrested on drug charges had caused
embarrassment for GMHC, the nation's largest AIDS service
organization, the cancellation of the summertime dance party
highlighted a more serious fund-raising problem.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a decline in private contributions, the agency has
eliminated more than a quarter of its staff positions in 15 months.
It has also dissolved a research department and consolidated two
other divisions. More cuts could be ahead for the agency, which
relies on donations for 80 percent of its $22.4 million operating
expense budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been painful,'' said Ronald Johnson, the agency's
managing director for public policy. ``We're potentially chipping
to the bone.''
</P>
<P>
   The decline in donations is not confined to GMHC. With the
advent of life-prolonging treatments and a significant drop in
AIDS-related deaths, AIDS groups in New York and across the country
are struggling. Donor fatigue has set in, even though HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS, continues to infect 40,000 new people a
year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS in America is no longer considered a problem; everybody
thinks it's gone away,'' said Larry Kramer, a writer who is one of
the six co-founders of GMHC. ``Aside from that, it's happening to
people who nobody wants to give any money to, poor people, people
of color, drug users. In the beginning, when gays were threatened,
gays gave money. But gays don't feel so threatened anymore. They
are giving money to fight for gay marriage and other gay issues.''
</P>
<P>
   As donations migrate to other causes, AIDS groups are trying to
reinvent fund-raising approaches and to devise fresh ones that
might compel potential contributors. Some struggling groups are
even considering mergers or pairing up with non-AIDS organizations.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, GMHC is taking part in the kind of
fund-raising events that might have seemed ridiculously arduous a
decade ago. Staff workers and volunteers, some of whom are
HIV-positive, will solicit pledges to run in the Marine Corps
Marathon this fall in Washington. They will join contingents from
AIDS Project Los Angeles and the Whitman-Walker Clinic in
Washington, another AIDS organization.
</P>
<P>
   Some AIDS groups are finding that they must venture further
afield to find support. The 15 AIDS service organizations that are
part of the Harlem Directors Group, for instance, are being
encouraged to approach cancer groups for joint projects and
financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are beginning to feel like they've probably given
enough to HIV and AIDS,'' said Ravinia Hayes-Cozier, the group's
executive director. ``For AIDS organizations, the ability to go
beyond HIV and AIDS is going to be important. Seven or eight years
ago, I would have said you could not do it because of the emergency
of the epidemic, but we cannot afford to just be a singular focus
disease entity.''
</P>
<P>
   Raising money has become so difficult for the People With AIDS
Coalition of New York, which offers informational phone lines,
support groups and forums, that it is considering a merger with
other AIDS service groups. Its executive director, Doug Wirth, said
a quarter of the coalition's $1 million annual budget used to come
from the bequests of AIDS patients. Now the amount is less than 5
percent because many people with AIDS are living longer.
</P>
<P>
   As the coalition tries to replace those funds, it has also faced
a drop in grants by the government, which is directing more
financing to outpatient health care and drug costs. ``It's been a
dramatic challenge and the question is, `How long can that be
sustained?''' said Wirth.
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of its name, GMHC is more closely linked to a gay
donor base than most AIDS service organizations, and it has long
been the most politically and economically connected group in the
world of nonprofit AIDS service. Even so, GMHC's operating expense
budget is down nearly $5 million from the budget two years before,
and it is seeking tenants to help it fill its 12-story headquarters
in the Chelsea section of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   With the cancellation of the Morning Party, the agency has lost
its second largest fund-raising event after the AIDS Walk, which
made $4.24 million last year, slightly down from the previous year.
The dance party attracted 4,500 people and raised $464,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to say it's not a tough hit,'' said Johnson,
the agency's managing director for public policy. ``It will have an
impact on the operation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Morning Party became a symbol of the agency's roots because
the same community that gave rise to GMHC summered in Fire Island
Pines, off the south shore of Long Island. Though the party began
as a modest affair in 1983, it evolved over time into a swank event
that attracted hordes of gay men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge piece of revenue and speaks directly to the core
constituency of GMHC, their leadership, their board,'' said Rodger
McFarlane, a former executive director of the agency. ``Those white
upper-middle-class gay men are really important to GMHC and always
have been.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the gay dance party on the edge of the Atlantic
lent cachet to a growing number of similar parties around the
nation, known as ``circuit parties.'' It also increasingly became
associated with illegal drug use and unsafe sex.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in the predawn hours leading up to the Morning Party,
a 35-year-old man from Bronxville overdosed and died. During the
event, a party producer hired to oversee security and to weed out
drug use was among 21 men picked up on charges of illegal drug
possession. The year before, the same number of drug arrests
occurred. And in 1996, a man slipped into a drug-induced coma and
had to be evacuated by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, as critics complained that the party was out of
control, GMHC officials cited educating partygoers about the
dangers of illegal drugs as one of the main reasons the
organization remained committed to the event. The agency started
holding drug counseling workshops on Fire Island around the party,
and distributed fliers warning partygoers that illicit drugs would
not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in an effort to recoup the loss of revenue from the Morning
Party, the agency is considering playing host at a series of
smaller house parties in the Pines.
</P>
<P>
   For some gay-rights advocates, the demise of the Morning Party
signals the loss of a part of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only fund-raiser that GMHC had that was still gay,
born in the gay community and targeting the gay community,'' said
Randy Wojcak, a former organizer of the Morning Party who serves on
GMHC's education and program committee. ``With the AIDS Walk, you
see people with baby strollers, wives, husbands, brothers and
sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kramer, the co-founder of GMHC, said gay men have never
contributed as substantially to the agency as people might believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Morning Party was an old and tired idea, good riddance as
far as I'm concerned,'' he said. ``It's a drop in the bucket
compared to what they need. They have a big building and a big
staff and they haven't got the money to take care of all these
things. There are a lot of wonderful programs that are really
severely threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last round of budget cuts, the talk was about which
programs should stay and which ones might go. Among the programs
that came under scrutiny was the buddy service, in which volunteers
are paired up with sickly clients to do chores like shopping and
laundry. The program, one of the agency's oldest, stays for now.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, volunteers like Dena Hammerstein hope the agency is
through the worst. Mrs. Hammerstein devotes her time to the Child
Life program, which serves HIV-positive women and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hammerstein is also a longtime donor. She said she and her
late husband, James Hammerstein, a producer who frequently directed
the musicals of his father, Oscar Hammerstein II, raised about
$10,000 for the program during the couple's silver anniversary
celebration last year.
</P>
<P>
   For five years now, Mrs. Hammerstein has volunteered twice a
week. But because of the high staff turnover, she knows less of the
staff workers these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of upheaval all over,'' she said. ``We
volunteers have gotten more active. I think we felt a need to. We
want to make sure we don't let our families down.''

REPORT ON TRASH FROM NEW YORK HAS VIRGINIA IN A TIZZY 
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hey, New York: Virginia is for lovers, not trash.
</P>
<P>
   That was the message Tuesday from some politicians and
environmentalists in Virginia, a state already saddled with the
dubious distinction as the nation's No. 2 importer of trash (after
Pennsylvania). They were responding to a report that the country's
largest waste-disposal company might be about to ship up to 4,000
more tons a day of New York garbage to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Waste Management Inc., and New York officials
hastened to insist that no change was imminent in their contractual
arrangement, under which 2,400 tons of New York trash a day is now
shipped to Virginia and other states. But just the possibility of
more Gotham garbage created an uproar among Virginians.
</P>
<P>
   Through Waste Management and other companies, New York already
supplies 60 percent of Virginia's imported trash, said state Sen.
William Bolling, a leader in his state's battle to stem the rising
tide of garbage. New York has been exporting large volumes of
garbage as it prepares to shut down the Fresh Kills landfill on
Staten Island in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported Tuesday that a contract had been
signed that would increase the daily tonnage of New York garbage
handled by Waste Management to 4,000, from 2,400, and permit all of
it to be sent to Virginia by barge.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Meket, a Waste Management spokeswoman in Virginia,
said the company had signed a contract with a barge company that
would allow up to 4,000 tons of garbage a day to be transported to
a new port on the James River that the company has been building.
</P>
<P>
   But she denied that a new contract had been signed with New York
to increase the tonnage from the city or to specify that its sole
destination would be Virginia. ``What needs to be taken into
consideration,'' she said, ``is that Waste Management has a lot of
operations on the East Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Paula Young, a spokeswoman for the New York City Department of
Transportation, said, ``There has been no change in the city's
contract with Waste Management.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Post report fanned anxieties in Virginia, where
just this week, Gov. James Gilmore said for the first time that he
would support measures to limit the amount of trash entering
Virginia's landfills and ban the transporting of trash by barge.
Mark Miner, a spokesman for the governor, said Tuesday that Gilmore
would make the trash issue a major theme of Wednesday night's State
of the Commonwealth address.
</P>
<P>
   ``As governor of Virginia, he will not sit idly by and allow
out-of-state garbage to be randomly dumped in Virginia,'' Miner
said.
</P>
<P>
   The day before the governor's announcement, Virginia
Commonwealth University released a poll showing that 87 percent of
those surveyed supported limiting the amount of out-of-state
garbage coming into Virginia. Only 9 percent said that limits
should not be imposed because of the additional revenues the trash
brings to the communities where the landfills are located.
</P>
<P>
   Bolling, a Republican, said the huge volume of imported garbage
_ now up to 4 million tons a year _ was exhausting the state's
landfill capacity, raising questions about whether there will be
room for the state's own garbage, creating environmental problems
and interfering with the state's efforts to attract tourists.
``Obviously, it's a good deal for New York,'' he said. ``They are
able t
</P>
<P>
   o transfer their problems to us. But it's not a very good thing
for Virginia.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Young said it was up to Waste Management, not New York City,
to decide where the garbage goes. ``We are their client,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Sharp, the executive director of Campaign Virginia, a
nonprofit environmental lobby, acknowledged that somehow New York
trash was more irksome to Virginians than trash from other places.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain it,'' he said. ``It's a Virginia thing.''

STUDY OF PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES ADVISES CHANGING FACULTY OF THE
FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  ((nk) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new report by administrators and trustees of public
universities urges that the nation's expanding number of part-time
instructors be better paid and more fully integrated into their
institutions while tenured professors be subject to reviews ending
in reward or punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The report also calls for greater accountability over
sabbaticals, including written proposals before and reports after,
as part of a set of measures intended to persuade legislators and
the public that state universities are running themselves more like
private corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the point where we have had an easy 30 years for
funding and now we need to relearn how to explain ourselves,'' said
John H. Hammang, director of special projects at the American
Association of State Colleges and Universities and the coordinator
of the 18-month study, ``Facing Change: Building the Faculty of the
Future.''
</P>
<P>
   The report's chairman, Charles B. Reed, chancellor of the
California State University system, said the main concern was
waning public confidence in the way public universities ran their
affairs, including tenure. The proportion of part-time instructors
has reached 50 percent of the faculty at many institutions, Reed
added.
</P>
<P>
   The number of part-time instructors has nearly doubled since
1970, largely a result of cost-saving efforts, according to a
report issued a year ago by the Modern Language Association of
America. That report said that from 1990 to 1995, 55 percent of the
7,598 Ph.D.'s who graduated in English and foreign-language
programs failed to find full-time tenure-track positions in the
year they received their degrees. It warned that such trends were
threatening the quality of higher education. Part-time instructors
often get a fraction of full-time salaries with no benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The new report made clear that a large percentage of part-time
instructors was inescapable and universities should train them,
evaluate them and pay them more like full-time teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The report also defended the importance of tenure for full-time
faculty in the name of academic freedom but said it should not
serve as a shield for nonproductive scholars.

JONES, EX-LIU STAR, FACING GUN CHARGE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Charles Jones, the former Long Island University
basketball player who led the nation in scoring the last two
seasons, was arraigned Monday in Brooklyn Criminal Court on gun
possession charges stemming from an incident at a campus dormitory
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 23, was also charged with menacing and harassment, the
Brooklyn district attorney's office said. He was released on $500
bail and faces a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a
$1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   According to a complaint filed Tuesday, Jones and two other men,
identified as Norman Epps, 38, and Gregory Cordew, 25, displayed a
firearm and threatened a security guard at LIU's Brooklyn campus
about 3 a.m. Sunday. Jones and the two other men, who were charged
along with him, threatened to rob the guard, Otho Babs, along with
other security guards, the complaint alleged.
</P>
<P>
   An unloaded .357 Magnum handgun was recovered from a planter in
front of a building in downtown Brooklyn where the defendants were
arrested, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release issued Tuesday, Brooklyn District Attorney
Charles J. Hynes described the charges against Jones as serious.
``They will be prosecuted swiftly and fairly,'' Hynes said.
</P>
<P>
   An LIU official said that Jones was no longer a student there
and that he was believed to have graduated last year.
</P>
<P>
   The incident may seal the fate of one of the most promising
college players in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a 6-foot-5-inch guard, transferred to LIU after two
seasons at Rutgers. Recruited by former LIU coach Ray Haskins, who
has known Jones since he was 8 and lives near his family in
Bedford-Stuyvesant, Jones blossomed under Haskins' run-and-gun
style.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was instrumental in helping the Blackbirds (21-9) win the
Northeast Conference championship in 1997 and a bid to the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, where they lost in the
first round to Villanova. That year, Jones won the Haggerty Award,
given annually to the outstanding Division I player in the New York
area.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Blackbirds were 21-11 and went to the National
Invitational Tournament, where Jones scored 45 points in a losing
effort against Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Pro scouts predicted that Jones would be picked in the early
rounds of last June's National Basketball Association draft. But
for reasons some attribute to a poor showing during the second half
of last season and to a one-dimensional game unsuited for an NBA
point guard, Jones was bypassed. Teammates and friends said Jones
was disappointed that he was not drafted, shattering his childhood
dream.

CARROLL RETURNING BUT FIRES TWO ASSISTANTS 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some coaches are taking the fall in Foxborough, but not Pete
Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Carroll's assistants, offensive line coach Paul Boudreau
and wide receivers coach Steve Walters, were fired Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe has been told that Carroll did the firing himself and
gave the impression that he was going to be head coach next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have scheduled a teleconference Wednesday, but the
fired coaches aren't supposed to be on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, vice president of player personnel Bobby Grier is
expected to give a ``State of the Patriots'' address that will end
speculation about Carroll being fired.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville Jaguars offensive coordinator Chris Palmer, who
would have been the first choice to succeed Carroll if the Patriots
fired him, was in Baltimore Tuesday interviewing for the Ravens'
head coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   Three other coaches on the New England staff _ Carl Smith (tight
ends), Bo Pelini (linebackers), and Ron Lynn (defensive backs) _
have contracts that have expired, and they have not been told their
fate yet, so more assistants could be made the scapegoats for the
Patriots' disappointing season.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, offensive coordinator Larry Kennan was fired after
just one season and replaced by Ernie Zampese, who had been fired
in Dallas when Chan Gailey became head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Boudreau and Walters were two of the coaches most respected by
the players on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Boudreau always drew praise from quarterback Drew Bledsoe and
the offensive linemen. When he was selected to the Pro Bowl a year
ago, Bruce Armstrong gave credit to Boudreau and showed his
appreciation by giving the coach and his wife a trip to Hawaii as a
reward.
</P>
<P>
   Walters was in his second go-around with the Patriots. He came
to pro football in 1982 when Ron Meyer was named head coach in New
England but spent most of his career on Jim Mora's staff in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll may have a hard time finding quality replacements. Right
now there is an abundance of coaching jobs open in the NFL, and the
Patriots figure to get last call.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Holmgren in Seattle, George Seifert in Carolina, Mike Riley
in San Diego, Andy Reid in Philadelphia, and Ray Rhodes in Green
Bay are all starting out in new jobs with long-term contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Patriots stage an amazing turnaround to win the AFC
East and get to the Super Bowl, Carroll undoubtedly will be fired
at the end of next season. So what assistant would want to come to
New England with a one-year contract?
</P>
<P>
   After this season ended with a playoff loss in Jacksonville in
the wild-card round, the Krafts, Bob and Jonathan, said there would
be a three-week evaluation of Carroll and the coaching staff. There
was no mention of evaluating Grier or vice president Andy
Wasynczuk, who have been in charge of hiring and firing players the
last two years as the team started a slide from the Super Bowl days
of two seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll told his coaches when he met with them after the season
that he did not want to make any changes. But obviously, by firing
Boudreau and Walters, Carroll is getting his marching orders from
the front office, most likely Grier, who is the relay station
through which the Krafts' directives come.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have not run the ball well the last two years,
which is why Boudreau is paying. However, they didn't run the ball
well when they went to the Super Bowl, either. The linemen Boudreau
was handed are excellent pass protectors but not run-blockers.
</P>
<P>
   Walters is most likely getting burned for the disappearance of
Terry Glenn the last two years. There must be some attempt by upper
management to explain why Glenn has not reached the heights he
attained as a rookie under Bill Parcells and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   There is speculation that Grier could reach out for Harold
Jackson as the next receivers coach. Jackson, who is currently with
the Saints, was a popular player in New England and later coached
here.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints, however, might not give permission for New England
to talk to Jackson. They don't have to if all the Patriots are
offering is a lateral move.

AFRICANIZED `KILLER BEES' INVADE L.A. COUNTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- `` `Killer bees' invade L.A. Fear strikes at
hearts of millions. . . . Authorities urge calm.''
</P>
<P>
   This is no bad Hollywood disaster flick from the '70s. It's an
official fact of life. Mark it down: Tuesday, Jan. 12, 1999, a
large chunk of Los Angeles County was officially declared colonized
by Africanized honeybees, a deadly hybrid that has claimed the
lives of five Americans since migrating through Mexico from South
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to urge that the public not panic on this issue,'' said
Cato Fiksdal, Los Angeles County agricultural commissioner. ``The
declaration of colonization does not really change anything, but
puts the county residents and agencies on a higher level of alert
regarding the presence of the bees.''
</P>
<P>
   Joined by state Department of Food and Agriculture officials,
Fiksdal told county supervisors the decision was made to issue the
colonization declaration to raise public consciousness about the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The boundaries of the bees' 1,010-square-mile range in the
county at this time extend from the harbor in the south up to
portions of the suburban San Fernando Valley -- south of the
Ventura Freeway from Topanga Canyon east -- and east to Pomona. The
bees are expected to enter the eastern end of the Antelope Valley
by spring.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said their declaration means people should
not be surprised to find Africanized honeybees in those areas. But
they don't think large numbers of the winged insects are there now,
nor do they think large numbers will be found soon.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 76 cities and 23 unincorporated areas have been
colonized, and the entire county is expected to be declared
colonized by the end of the year, ``if not sooner,'' Fiksdal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once here, they're here forever,'' he added. ``It's never
going to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiksdal said he would like to explore the possibility of an
ordinance allowing the county to send pest-control companies onto
private property to eradicate killer bees in cases where the
property owner can't afford a private service or simply won't agree
to hire one.
</P>
<P>
   The board voted unanimously to have Fiksdal work with county
attorneys to come up with a model ordinance for all cities in the
county.
</P>
<P>
   The killer bees' presence in Los Angeles County doesn't appear
to be part of a westward migration from Texas all the way to
Fontana and the Victorville area in neighboring San Bernardino
County since the bees entered the United States from Mexico in
1990, Fiksdal said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they appear to have ``hitchhiked'' on ships from Latin
America, establishing a colony in Lawndale, in South L.A., last
month, for example. A swarm -- a breakaway group moving to a new
location -- was also found in nearby Carson in November.
</P>
<P>
   The bees are not altogether new to the Los Angeles area. A
previous hitchhikers' colony was found in Long Beach Harbor in July
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is the first time they've entered a major urban
area,'' said Bill Routhier, a state Department of Food and
Agriculture expert on Africanized honeybees.
</P>
<P>
   The entire county -- all 4,083 square miles of it -- is likely
to be declared colonized within a year, Fiksdal said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by county Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich how officials
could deal with the killer bees, Fiksdal said there is no way to
prevent or eliminate them altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the experts say it is something we will have to learn
to live with,'' he said during a presentation to the Board of
Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   While efforts were taken to eliminate all the killer bees found
so far, authorities believe that many could have moved on before
the eradication took place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better to alert the public than wait till somebody gets
stung,'' Fiksdal said.
</P>
<P>
   One or two stings aren't the problem. It's that the bees very
aggressively defend their hive -- including attacking anyone who
gets too close, he and Routhier said.
</P>
<P>
   Five people have died in the United States from killer-bee
attacks, with the most recent death occurring in April 1997 in Casa
Grande, Ariz. There have been several attacks on humans and animals
in Southern California, but no deaths, Routhier said.
</P>
<P>
   To the naked eye, the killer bees are physically
indistinguishable from the European bees that already live in the
United States. In fact, it takes wing measurements under a
microscope or even DNA testing to determine whether a honeybee is
Africanized, Fiksdal said.
</P>
<P>
   But by their unrelenting attacks -- wave upon wave of bees --
you will know them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public will know the difference,'' Fiksdal said.

DOCTORED PHOTO HURT REPUTATION, DUSTIN HOFFMAN TESTIFIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Dustin Hoffman testified that a glossy magazine's
decision to put his head on a photo of a man in a Richard Tyler
silk gown a la ``Tootsie'' wasn't funny -- not even close.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the movie star said it made him look like a has-been,
willing to exploit his Oscar-nominated role because he was washed
up and needed the money.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the witness stand Tuesday in his lawsuit against Los
Angeles magazine, Hoffman pointed with disgust to a blowup of Los
Angeles magazine's digitally altered photo, which was part of a
fashion layout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a fish in the ocean,'' Hoffman said. ``The sharks
don't bother you unless they think you are wounded. That to me
signified a wounded career.''
</P>
<P>
   His two hours of testimony highlighted the first day of the
federal court trial.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman sued the magazine and its publisher in April 1997, just
a few weeks after the ``Grand Illusions'' fashion layout appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman claims the magazine trivialized his beloved ``Tootsie''
character by making readers believe he had re-created the role for
an advertorial supplement.
</P>
<P>
   He told U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian Jr. that the
magazine should pay him ``millions of dollars'' for the alleged
damage to his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, former Los Angeles magazine Editor in Chief
Michael Caruso testified by videotape that the article was clearly
meant to be humorous.
</P>
<P>
   Caruso pointed out that other celebrities were altered by
computer to wear 1997 fashions in the layout, including several who
have been dead for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's photo caption read, ``Dustin Hoffman isn't a drag in a
butter-colored silk gown by Richard Tyler and Ralph Lauren heels.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he was concerned about the actors' reaction to the
spread, Caruso said: ``Not particularly. I sort of thought they
would get a kick out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman clearly didn't.
</P>
<P>
   He sued for violation of rights of privacy, claiming the
magazine's decision to digitally alter his photo showed ``reckless
disregard for the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Tevrizian already has refused to dismiss the lawsuit on First
Amendment grounds, stating in court papers that the magazine has to
prove its article had ``cultural and informational value'' beyond
the mere exploitation of Hoffman's name.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman made it clear that he would never consent to a photo
like the one that appeared in the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had seen that picture with another actor on the level of
(Robert) De Niro advertising bathrobes because he wore one in
`Raging Bull,' it would signal something to me,'' Hoffman said. ``I
would ask: Why would he do that? Does he need the money?''
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old actor said it has become more important to
protect his reputation because as time goes on, the talent of
actors is sometimes ``irrelevant'' during casting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the mind-set in this town, particularly in the last two
years. . . . The most important thing is to get an audience in the
very first weekend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said actors create a negative image for themselves when
they appear in commercials and on television. ``It's the perception
that your career is in the decline -- that you need the money, that
you no longer have the opportunities that you had before.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit isn't Hoffman's first legal complaint against a
member of the entertainment industry, or even his first involving
``Tootsie.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the two-time Oscar winner filed a lawsuit against
Columbia Pictures, claiming he is owed more than $1 million in
proceeds from the 1982 comedy. He also sued Castle Rock Productions
and director Harold Becker in 1996, contending that they ``failed
and refused'' to honor an oral contract that ensured him a small
part in ``City Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said he has been paid to appear in one commercial in the
United States -- a spot for Volkswagen in the mid-1960s that paid
him $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   After the success of ``The Graduate'' in 1967, Hoffman said he
only appeared in domestic commercials for educational purposes or
charity. But he admitted he has accepted overseas commercials in
places like Japan, in part because he saw A-list actors like Tom
Cruise and Michael Douglas doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be offered what the other big guys were being
offered,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman was nominated for a best-actor Academy Award for
``Tootsie'' and six other films. He won Oscars for two films that
dealt with legal battles -- ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' and ``Rain Man.''

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Michael Jordan will tip over the first domino today, removing
himself from the NBA's three-time defending champions.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And while the fallout from his retirement will shake the Chicago
Bulls to their foundation, it has already reached Houston and the
Rockets' offices as swiftly as a Jordan drive to an open basket.
</P>
<P>
   With Jordan gone, one of the primary reasons for running mate
Scottie Pippen to stay in Chicago no longer exists. And without
Jordan to send the team's payroll toward the court in Space Jam,
the Bulls can join the chase for free agent Antonio McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets have cleared enough room under the salary cap to
pursue either frontcourt star and have initiated conversations with
the representatives of both.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rockets have interest. Scottie has interest,'' said
Pippen's agent, Jimmie Sexton. ``It's something he's considering
strongly. What really makes it look so inviting is with Charles
(Barkley), Hakeem (Olajuwon) and Scottie, there's a three-person
nucleus that's very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexton said Jordan's decision ``doesn't really affect anything''
in regard to his client. But Jordan's decision does not make that
of the Rockets any easier, not that anyone is ready to describe
their dilemma as simply making a choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two goals (going into this offseason's rebuilding),''
Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``One is to stay competitive
with our eye on a championship. The other one is to induce some
youth into this organization.''
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to address both players and their vastly
different qualifications, as either _ along with the Rockets' three
draft picks _ would help the Rockets take a step toward answering
the need to win now and build for later.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess, in addition to considering the Rockets, is weighing
whether to remain with the Phoenix Suns or return to the Denver
Nuggets, his original pro team. He has also said he would consider
the Bulls, and sources said his representatives have heard often
from Chicago officials since teams and agents were allowed to begin
talking Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen is expected to be targeted by the Suns, Orlando Magic and
Los Angeles Lakers, who would likely try to work out a
sign-and-trade deal with the Bulls involving Elden Campbell or
Eddie Jones.
</P>
<P>
   But as unpredictable as the recruiting of top NBA talent will
surely be when players can begin signing next week, the Rockets
must weigh how different talents will fit.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess, 24, would offer a young, blossoming talent likely to
still be in his prime through a six-year deal, the longest teams
signing other teams' free agents are permitted to offer. He
averaged 15.1 points and 7.6 rebounds while sharing time in the
crowded Suns frontcourt last season.
</P>
<P>
   Any team interested in McDyess will likely have to offer the
maximum contract permitted, beginning at $9 million in the first
season, with 10-percent raises each year.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, who is seeking a five-year deal, is already established
as one of the top 50 players in league history, with six
championships and seven All-Star appearances. But he is 33 and,
though reportedly ready for the season, coming off back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   And if Pippen demands the maximum salary allowed an 11-year
veteran, beginning at $14 million per season, the Rockets might
have trouble fitting him under the cap.
</P>
<P>
   But if a window opened with Jordan's decision, even at an
inconvenient, baffling time, the Rockets' pursuit of a marquee free
agent might have been changed as much as the Bulls' chances at a
seventh title.

MAKING BEST OF BAD SITUATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Let's look at the good side:
</P>
<P>
   -- Chicago will cease to be the most annoyingly insufferable
sports city in America. It will be Milwaukee with hockey.
</P>
<P>
   -- Nike's share value lost 5.4 percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   -- Casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic City increased staffing 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who also owns the White Sox,
needs to have great things happen from Bill Wennington and Nardi
Contreras.
</P>
<P>
   -- Unable to find someone to cover for his frequent brainlocks,
Scottie Pippen will become the NBA's version of Kenny in ``South
Park'' _ killed every show.
</P>
<P>
   -- Ahmad Rashad will need to find someone else's hip pocket to
be carried around in.
</P>
<P>
   -- Toni Kukoc will have to break a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   -- A team that has not employed one among Jordan, Hakeem
Olajuwon, Isiah Thomas, Julius Erving, Larry Bird or Magic Johnson
will win an NBA championship for the first time since the Sonics'
championship 20 years ago, so NBC will be forced to file Chapter
11.
</P>
<P>
   -- George Karl will move back one more spot, to No. 1,238, just
behind Roseanne, on the list to eventually succeed Dean Smith at
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   -- Dennis Rodman will have more time to spend on his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's look at the bad side:
</P>
<P>
   -- Jordan isn't taking us with him.
</P>
<P>
   Can you believe this guy? All the stuff bought with his name on
it, and he leaves us with a broken-down league in a bastard season.
</P>
<P>
   Tempting as it is to call him an ingrate, it's hard to argue
with his reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the worst pro sports season since the NFL's use of
strike-breaking scab players in 1987. Fifty games will be played in
about 100 days mostly by guys who are fat, old and hurt and don't
know each other. By May each team is going to look like the
Iditarod dog sled team that had to pull a grand piano.
</P>
<P>
   Why would Jordan want any part of this? Why would a basketball
fan want a part of this? I'd prefer a presentation of Kevin
Calabro's chickens flyin' in a barnyard.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the Sonic brass, including owner Barry Ackerley, called
a news conference to announce an effort to win back fans that was
breathtakingly lame.
</P>
<P>
   The goodies: free open scrimmage, free exhibition game, a fix-up
of some local basketball courts.
</P>
<P>
   Woo-eee. For this, the fan is supposed to say, ``All is
forgiven''?
</P>
<P>
   The feeble gestures were yet another example of the arrogant
attitudes that fueled the lockout. I asked Ackerley, in light of
the half-season, why all tickets shouldn't be half-price.
</P>
<P>
   He deferred to a henchman, John Dresel, who said the good news
was the Sonics decided not to raise ticket prices, and that no
price cuts were contemplated ``to reflect the value of Sonic
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   A case can be made that this NBA season will have almost no
value. The '99 title will bear an asterisk bigger than Shawn Kemp's
ballooning waistline. The half-season will be almost devoid of
training camp and practices, players will have no clue about new
teammates, they will be forced to play beyond exhaustion, injuries
will be pervasive and the games will be officiated by the handful
of NBA veteran referees not in jail.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, the owners have cost certainty, and for that I can't
begin to describe my sense of relief. The mere thought of Ackerley,
Reinsdorf, Paul Allen, Ted Turner, etc., having to pick up the
phone to transfer funds to cover a temporary cash shortfall in a
minor business operation has interrupted my sleep with screams
every night.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is Jordan's concern anymore. He claims to be done,
and the rest of us are left to sort and catalogue the legacy.
Here's five fresh entries.
</P>
<P>
   Best local Jordan tale I heard Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was playing with the Bulls in the '80s, we had a
reserve guard named Pete Myers,'' said Billy McKinney, the Sonics'
basketball VP and former journeyman guard. ``He had some talent,
but his job was to guard Jordan in practice. We all wondered how
much damage was done to his potential by that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never know how good Pete might have been if he didn't
have to go up against a guy who every single day was trying to tear
his heart out.''
</P>
<P>
   Worst advice to Jordan:
</P>
<P>
   McKinney, again: ``Before the 1985-86 season, I told him that if
he continues to work at his pace, he'll burn out in six or seven
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Most hapless task:
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to use the written word to capture the most majestic
physical artist in sports history.
</P>
<P>
   Best guess:
</P>
<P>
   He'll be back.
</P>
<P>
   Worst outcome:
</P>
<P>
   For that to happen, the NBA will have to be here.

YOU HAD TO LOVE JORDAN, EVEN AS HE BROKE HEARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It is impossible not to suspect that Michael Jordan
the pitch man, Michael Jordan the business man, Michael Jordan the
golfer and Michael Jordan the world's greatest celebrity will have
a plentiful life after today.
</P>
<P>
   But the other Jordan _ Michael Jordan the world's greatest
basketball player _ will be missed, should this second retirement
stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad day for the NBA and fans,'' Sonic guard and Chicago
native Hersey Hawkins said Tuesday. ``For the players who enjoyed
playing against him, we're going to miss that. He was the best
player in the NBA. He was the most recognized face in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, Hawkins was a bit skeptical that someone as
competitive, as driven, as on top of his game as Jordan could
really walk away from basketball right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's official yet,'' Hawkins said, as news of
today's planned retirement ceremony in Chicago was pulsing across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, no one can quite believe it, which is funny,
because along with the joy of Jordan during all his years _ from
North Carolina's 1982 NCAA title win over Georgetown to that sixth
NBA title over Utah last June _ he inflicted so much pain, denying
everyone but himself and his teammates the ultimate glory.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the love, along with the adoration, Michael Jordan
broke hearts everywhere he went.
</P>
<P>
   Be it at Madison Square Garden, where he owned the Knicks; or in
Cleveland, where he stalked and killed the helpless Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   He once rose like a phoenix in Phoenix, where Sir Charles' NBA
title dreams died.
</P>
<P>
   And, most recently, he stamped his everlasting superlative image
in Utah, where Karl Malone was the NBA's 1997 MVP out of pity's
sake and Jordan still crushed any shred of self-respect in the
Jazz, not once but two years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Right in the middle of all this, Jordan showed Seattle how
deadly it was to ever doubt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had not returned (to the NBA midway through the 1994-95
season),'' Hawkins said, ``we would have won (the 1996 NBA
Finals).''
</P>
<P>
   Just their luck, the 1995-96 Sonics had their franchise-best
season the first full season after Jordan returned from his first
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   He was there to deny them, 64-wins and all.
</P>
<P>
   He added a fadeaway jumper. He added more attitude, stoked
against the naysayers who said Jordan could not come back the way
he was when he gave Chicago its first three-peat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year he managed to get better when he was already at the
top of his game,'' Hawkins said, thinking back to '96 and the
Sonics' brush with greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``To improve on that was a little astounding. And not only did
he get better physically, he got smarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``His basketball IQ got smarter, especially as he learned to
play with others. He learned he couldn't do it by himself, and he
needed everyone on his team to be part of that effort.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Bulls won Games 1 and 2 of the '96 Finals in Chicago
and then stretched their lead to 3-0 in a blowout at KeyArena,
something funny started to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, after the grueling 72-win season that secured the Bulls'
place in history, started to wilt. The year with gamblin' man
Dennis Rodman was wearing on him. So was the relentless effort to
get teammates like Toni Kukoc, Luc Longley, Derek Harper and even
Scottie Pippen to play like champions.
</P>
<P>
   And as the Bulls were being manhandled by the Sonics in Games 4
and 5, Jordan spent his five days in Seattle playing too much golf
_ as much as 36 holes at Broadmoor one day alone.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was desperate for the end of the season, but the Sonics
won two straight.
</P>
<P>
   Were the Bulls and Jordan finally stoppable?
</P>
<P>
   The answer would come, swiftly, in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   If Jordan's quest (under coach Phil Jackson's guidance) for the
Bulls to win 72 regular-season games had done anything, it ensured
that Jordan would be back home at the United Center for the finale.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Jordanesque karma would have it, Game 6 was played on
Father's Day _ a day for which Jordan had to hold onto every ounce
of self-control in order to persevere for the one thing that could
soothe him. His father, murdered in 1993, would be honored by the
actions of his son on this day.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, I sat in the United Center, four rows from
courtside. And on that night, Michael Jordan seemed merely mortal.
He looked not so much like Superman, but like an everyday man from
whom pain and loss had taken a toll.
</P>
<P>
   And on that night, Rodman's strength and rebounds were more than
necessary. Harper's defense was critical, if the Bulls were going
to win.
</P>
<P>
   Those two Bulls came through for their leader that night.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Sonics, they could only hang around, incapable of a
winning surge, understanding perhaps they were up against a force
of nature beyond their control.
</P>
<P>
   When the buzzer sounded, an exhausted Jordan collapsed on the
floor, weeping, only to get up, run into the Bulls locker room and
collapse again. He lay there on the floor so still, weeping so
silently, no one was sure he wasn't going to expire himself.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Michael Jordan that moment, before the TV camera was
shooed away and as he was left to mourn in peace, you understood
that this was awesome.
</P>
<P>
   You understood this most gifted basketball player was the only
one in the world who could summon every shred of his mind, body and
spirit and direct it toward one, singular, relentless, graceful,
uncompromised, mind-bending, jaw-dropping display of supernatural
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   He could beat you, beat your team, beat the odds, beat the
expectations, and still, you shook your head in joyful amazement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the consummate professional,'' Hawkins said about what
he learned, what we all learned about Jordan that moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was going to stay the best in the game by any means
necessary,'' Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   And he was going to walk away that very same way.

BULLS' LOSS IS NBA'S GAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ While the end of Michael Jordan's supernatural journey
might elicit a tear or two, don't expect any sympathy for the
Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's expected retirement today may not be good short-term
for the NBA, which is trying to improve its image after a long
labor battle. However, the path is clear for another organization
to stand tall in June.
</P>
<P>
   When Jordan has played a full season, no team other than the
Bulls has won the NBA championship in the '90s. As Cleveland
Cavaliers forward Shawn Kemp once said: ``I'm tired of watching
Michael and the Bulls celebrate championships on television.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The day he leaves is the day we all elevate our teams without
making one iota of a personnel move,'' Orlando Magic general
manager John Gabriel said. ``Many a team and fan have been
heartbroken by his last-minute heroics. They won't shed a tear for
him I'm sure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't ask me to cry any tears for (Chicago general
manager) Jerry Krause. Even without Michael, they came out of the
lockout better than anybody,'' said one general manager. ``They're
not being held hostage by Michael's decision. They're in a great
position to re-sign all their guys from last year.''
</P>
<P>
   However, they have only four players under contract _ Ron
Harper, Toni Kukoc, Randy Brown and Keith Booth _ from last year's
championship team, with Harper the only starter.
</P>
<P>
   They have a league-high 10 free agents. The Bulls must decide if
they want to re-sign high-priced free agent Scottie Pippen and try
to build around him _ possibly with some of their other free agents
like Steve Kerr, Luc Longley, Jud Buechler and Scott Burrell _ or
rebuild from scratch. Regardless, they probably won't be favored to
win it all.
</P>
<P>
   What the league loses in Jordan's luster, it will make up in
competitive balance, said New Jersey's Rony Seikaly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible for basketball, but it's a great chance for all
of the other teams,'' said Seikaly, whose Nets were eliminated from
last year's playoffs by Jordan and the Bulls. ``Right now, you can
pick a name out of a hat and that's the team that's going to
advance to the finals.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana seems to be the team in place to take the reins in the
Eastern Conference. The Pacers, who pushed the Bulls to seven games
in the conference finals last year, have nine players signed. In
the West, Utah has 10 players under contract, including the same
nucleus that finished second to the Bulls each of the past two
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the league, you want to see him stay around. He has a
great following and has been a wonderful ambassador,'' said Utah
forward Adam Keefe. ``From a selfish respect, if he hadn't been
around, we would have won two championships.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers, San Antonio, New York and Miami also
must be considered solid contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The league suddenly will go from praising His Airness to
appreciating parity.
</P>
<P>
   NBA commissioner David Stern kept bracing himself for this day,
saying throughout the lockout that Jordan's retirement ``is
inevitable.'' Albeit never a good time, Jordan's departure at this
juncture squeezes the league as it attempts to rebound from a
bitter labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   So who or what can spark interest if the fans are still
apathetic?
</P>
<P>
   Several players have tried to anoint the ``next'' Jordan.
Detroit's Grant Hill was supposed to be the new prince. Most
recently, Lakers phenom Kobe Bryant has gotten the nod.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from his charisma and mass appeal, no one has yet to
approach Jordan's skill level. He departed the game unable to be
stopped or beaten. In a sense, Jordan left without passing the
torch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could survive without him,'' Bulls free agent Bill
Wennington said. ``But it would really be a setback. People love to
watch him play. I love to watch him play.''

NEW OSU COACH DENNIS ERICKSON GETS HERO'S WELCOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. _ A band played. Cheerleaders squealed. People
stood and applauded wildly. Dennis Erickson caused the commotion
when he emerged from a black, balloonlike helmet and formally
introduced himself as the Oregon State football coach.
</P>
<P>
   It was an entry better suited for a game-show host, and a far
cry from the NFL, but Erickson didn't seem to mind. He had a job
again after being unemployed for two weeks _ and for the first time
in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   After a fast-track courtship, the former Seahawks coach on
Tuesday took over the nation's losingest Division I program,
promising to stay awhile and make things happen on the field and
not off it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully I'm here for a long time,'' Erickson said in the
1{-year-old Valley Football Center. ``But that's a two-way street.
We have to win some games.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing one of two national championship rings he earned at
Miami, Erickson was reluctant to spell out specific goals, other
than to take immediate aim at the Beavers' 27 consecutive losing
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But his players, many awed by a resum &UR; gfacute &LR; e that includes
four college stops and his Seahawks stint, figure an end to the
losing streak is a given. They're making postseason plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to a bowl game this year, a good bowl game,''
reserve running back Avery Cummings said.
</P>
<P>
   The inflated helmet seemed to dwarf Erickson as he made his way
to a roomful of reporters, boosters and players. Otherwise, it was
the coach who cast a huge shadow over the Pac-10's smallest
football program.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings, seated atop a red mountain bike as he headed to class,
rubbed sleep and stars from his eyes after a 7 a.m. team meeting to
acquaint him and teammates with Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could think about was he's a celebrity,'' the junior
said. ``When I met him, I really wanted to ask him for his
autograph.''
</P>
<P>
   Erickson, 51, agreed to a five-year contract that will pay him
$300,000 per season, with a base of $150,000. For the first year,
as part of his Seahawks severance, he also will collect $1 million
from his former employers _ the difference between his NFL salary
and his current one.
</P>
<P>
   The Everett native becomes the Beavers' 27th coach, replacing
Mike Riley, who resigned last Thursday to become the San Diego
Chargers coach. Riley, in town for a few days to gather his
belongings, attended Tuesday's news conference but stayed in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson was hired almost within 36 hours after the job opened.
He called Oregon State athletic director Mitch Barnhart the night
of Riley's resignation to express interest. Barnhart, whose other
possibilities were Idaho's Chris Tormey, Colorado State's Sonny
Lubick and Kansas State offensive coordinator Ron Hudson, initially
was skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing you think is this can't work,'' the Beaver AD
said, alluding to fiscal restraints. ``I was surprised. I was
intrigued. I began to think of the possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviewing other candidates the next day, Barnhart tried to
fly back into Portland and was rerouted to Seattle because of fog.
Taking a chance, he called Erickson at home at 11:30 that night.
They agreed to meet the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   Barnhart said he was looking for a head coach with a West Coast
background. Erickson, shunning a couple of NFL assistant job
offers, decided he was better suited to becoming a college head
coach again.
</P>
<P>
   At Seattle's Roosevelt Hotel early Saturday, a deal was struck.
Erickson was now 1-for-2 with the Beavers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Erickson, who was at Idaho, tried to move to Oregon
State when Joe Avezzano was fired. Then athletic director Dee
Andros gave him a vote of confidence. Then president John Byrne
chose the much more conservative Dave Kragthorpe, who was fired in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to wait 15 years to get him,'' Andros said of Erickson.
``I was overruled. But I think Denny has got the right idea now.
He'll get some kids in here who will help us. I don't know what we
could have done better.''
</P>
<P>
   People at Miami and Washington State might differ. In 1994, the
Florida school was stripped of 24 scholarships and banned from a
bowl for one season for a wide variety of NCAA offenses that
occurred on Erickson's watch. The second of his two teams in
Pullman had a cumulative 1.94 grade-point average.
</P>
<P>
   He had to answer to his past Tuesday, first to an athletic
advisory committee, then to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He addresssed that in our meeting,'' said Bob Foreman, Beaver
Club president. ``He said that was a long time ago and you win two
national titles (in Miami) and it turns into a carnival atmosphere.
He said everybody has skeletons in their closet. He's matured.''
</P>
<P>
   To media members, Erickson simply said he was never directly
implicated in any wrongdoing. Barnhart seemed satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no concern about that,'' said the Beaver official, who
spent 13 years as a Tennessee assistant AD. ``I know he's going to
get it done the right away. I feel very confident we will conduct
ourselves in the fashion that the institution wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving from an NFL head coaching job to a similar collegiate
post, Erickson joins a rare breed. Others in modern times who have
backtracked: George Allen (Long Beach State), Lou Holtz (Arkansas,
Minnesota, Notre Dame, South Carolina), John Mackovic (Illinois,
Texas), John Ralston (San Jose State), John Robinson (USC), Gene
Stallings (Alabama) and Bill Walsh (Stanford).
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had shown the slightest interest in the Washington
job, Erickson answered with a quip: ``I coached at Washington
State.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he take any shots at the Seahawks, who replaced him with
Mike Holmgren over the weekend: ``No hard feelings. They decided
they wanted to go another way. We inherited a 2-14 team and we got
it respectable. I wish them luck. That's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Erickson said he will bring Seahawk assistants Gregg Smith and
Eric Yaber to Corvallis, and possibly more. He also will interview
five holdover Beaver assistants.
</P>
<P>
   His arrival spurred a flurry of calls Tuesday to the OSU ticket
office. It is hoped that with instant success and beefed-up crowds,
a second deck at Parker Stadium can be built, enlarging capacity
from 37,000 to 55,000. But that's long-range dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Beavers need to break the losing-season streak;
then they might become Kansas State West, a longtime loser turned
winner. No question, Erickson has people excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wanted us to get the respect of the nation and have
fun,'' sophomore offensive lineman Dustin Janz said. ``He said it's
going to happen. We're going to win here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' Erickson said.

INSURER BACK ON ITS FEET AFTER NEARLY BEING FLATTENED BY
EARTHQUAKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It took less than a minute of shake, rattle and
roll to undo nearly four decades of growth at 20th Century
Industries.
</P>
<P>
   While the company's steel-and-glass Warner Center headquarters
in suburban Woodland Hills took some licks in the 1994 Northridge
Earthquake, the homes of thousands of 20th Century policyholders
were destroyed or nearly so by the magnitude-6.7 temblor.
</P>
<P>
   Like the surrounding San Fernando Valley as a whole, 20th
Century was blindsided, caught woefully underprepared for the scale
of the devastation. But also like the Valley, the Woodland Hills
insurer has staged a stunning comeback in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Before the earthquake, 20th Century officials thought the
company was ready for any calamity.
</P>
<P>
   Consulting the California Department of Insurance and an outside
specialist, ``we'd done our reinsurance calculations on probable
maximum losses,'' said 20th Century Chief Executive William
Mellick.
</P>
<P>
   The best estimates were that the company would need to pay out
$90 million to $110 million in a worst-case disaster. ``So we went
out and bought $100 million in reinsurance,'' Mellick said.
</P>
<P>
   In the months immediately after the mid-January quake, 20th
Century was forced to pay out more than $800 million in claims, a
figure that would rise to more than $1 billion by the time the dust
had settled.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, homeowner insurance at the time accounted for just
10 percent of 20th Century's revenues, proving to be a loss leader
of the worst sort. The company's bread and butter had always been
-- and still is -- automobile insurance, in which it is one of the
state's largest and lowest-priced players.
</P>
<P>
   In the quake's aftermath, 20th Century faced its share of
disgruntled customers, highlighted in 1997 by a court order for the
company to pay a suburban Tarzana couple $6.75 million in punitive
damages for repeatedly denying the claim on their destroyed home.
Scores of others filed complaints or simply stewed at what they
considered to be the company's slow or tightfisted response to the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, 20th Century fulfilled its obligations
thoroughly, Mellick said, as evidenced by the $498 million loss it
recorded for the year, its first loss in company history. In fact,
20th Century's losses, stemming from nearly 46,000 claims, were so
heavy that the company's very future was thrown into question.
</P>
<P>
   With cash quickly running out and more claims pouring in, ``we
were at the edge of a cliff, looking down,'' Mellick said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a plan worked out with state regulators to stave off
insolvency, the company agreed to eliminate its homeowners business
and significantly boost cash reserves, which had dropped from more
than $500 million just before the quake to less than $200 million
two months after the disaster. In exchange, the state allowed 20th
Century to raise its auto insurance rates.
</P>
<P>
   To increase its dwindling reserves, 20th Century took out loans
and sought out a strategic partner. It found one with American
International Group Inc. of New York, one of the nation's largest
commercial property and casualty underwriters. In exchange for $432
million, AIG got a 43 percent stake in the Woodland Hills company.
</P>
<P>
   And that has made all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   With the stability and cash flow the AIG investment provided,
20th Century finished paying off the bulk of the claims by
mid-1995. Thanks in large part to the auto-rates hike, the company
even managed a second-quarter profit of $14.6 million and was $70
million in the black by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996 it was clear that 20th Century had backed away from the
brink, definitely turned around and was facing financial success
again. The company opened an office in Arizona -- its first foray
outside California -- and continued to increase its revenues in
California. Encouraged by growth, the company asked for and
received approval to lower its auto insurance rates again.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the success made 20th Century all the more
appealing to white-knight AIG. Exercising 16 million warrants for
20th Century common stock, AIG last July took a controlling
interest in the company, boosting its total ownership to 50.27
percent.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1998, 20th Century had expanded to Nevada, Oregon
and Washington, and its share price had rebounded from roughly $9
in the months after the Northridge Earthquake to $21.50 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A second office tower, expected to open by the end of the year,
is under construction to accommodate 20th Century's growing
business. Once again, the insurer is among the Valley's largest
firms in both market capitalization and employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see -- not only did we come back, but we've grown,''
said Mellick. ``It's a happy ending.''

insolvency, the company agreed to eliminate its homeowners business
and significantly boost cash reserves, which had dropped from more
than $500 million just before the quake to less than $200 million
two months after the disaster. In exchange, the state allowed 20th
Century to raise its auto insurance rates.
</P>
<P>
   To increase its dwindling reserves, 20th Century took out loans
and sought out a strategic partner. It found one with American
International Group Inc. of New York, one of the nation's largest
commercial property and casualty underwriters. In exchange for $432
million, AIG got a 43 percent stake in the Woodland Hills company.
</P>
<P>
   And that has made all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   With the stability and cash flow the AIG investment provided,
20th Century finished paying off the bulk of the claims by
mid-1995. Thanks in large part to the auto-rates hike, the company
even managed a second-quarter profit of $14.6 million and was $70
million in the black by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996 it was clear that 20th Century had backed away from the
brink, definitely turned around and was facing financial success
again. The company opened an office in Arizona -- its first foray
outside California -- and continued to increase its revenues in
California. Encouraged by growth, the company asked for and
received approval to lower its auto insurance rates again.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the success made 20th Century all the more
appealing to white-knight AIG. Exercising 16 million warrants for
20th Century common stock, AIG last July took a controlling
interest in the company, boosting its total ownership to 50.27
percent.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1998, 20th Century had expanded to Nevada, Oregon
and Washington, and its share price had rebounded from roughly $9
in the months after the Northridge Earthquake to $21.50 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A second office tower, expected to open by the end of the year,
is under construction to accommodate 20th Century's growing
business. Once again, the insurer is among the Valley's largest
firms in both market capitalization and employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see -- not only did we come back, but we've grown,''
said Mellick. ``It's a happy ending.''

OTHERS WILL MAKE HEADLINES, SUNS SAY  
 JORDAN'S TALENT, WILL TO WIN INSPIRED PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suns guard Rex Chapman picked up his newspaper Tuesday morning
and showed it to his 6-year-old son, Zeke, who is just learning to
read.
</P>
<P>
   The father asked his son to read the headline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jordan Returns?'' Zeke said, hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, try again,'' Zeke's dad said, patiently.
</P>
<P>
   Zeke looked over the black print again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jordan Retires,'' he said, his voice falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one who really hates to see him go is my son. He was a
little upset about it,'' Chapman said.
</P>
<P>
   Zeke isn't alone.
</P>
<P>
   While it wasn't unexpected, the news that the Chicago Bulls
superstar will announce his retirement today shook a league already
on loose footing from a labor lockout that has left fans more
apathetic than angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't fool ourselves,'' Suns guard Jason Kidd said. ``There
is going to be an impact. First, the lockout hurt basketball, and
now this is going to be another black eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan leaves with six NBA championship rings, and he takes with
him much of the responsibility for the league's growth over the
past decade. He took the torch from Larry Bird and Magic Johnson
and carried the game to new levels of popularity and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will definitely be one of the big stories in basketball,''
Suns forward Danny Manning said. ``Who will the torch be passed to?
We don't know. Who can carry it like Michael has? No one.''
</P>
<P>
   But Manning said the league will go on and will prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Kleine, who played last season with the Bulls, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will never be another guy like him,'' Kleine said. ``I
don't think there will be another Bird or Magic or Bill Russell or
(Kareem Abdul-) Jabbar. But there will be guys who carve their own
niche.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to imagine one who will have the impact Jordan
did, at least in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved playing against Michael because he's the best who has
ever played the game,'' said Suns Coach Danny Ainge, who twice
faced Jordan's Bulls in the NBA Finals. ``Having a chance just to
do that, to say you've played against the best ever, to say you
blocked his shot once _ from behind _ but the biggest thing of all
that I admire is that he came to play hard every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to live up to being Michael Jordan, and people can't
relate to how difficult that is. Every single night, knowing that
if he doesn't score 30 points or do something special, fans are
going to go away disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Night in and night out, he played at that level against the
best players in the world, knowing that everything they're doing
defensively is geared to stop him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's talent was hard to match, but his competitiveness made
him legendary.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was with Washington, we had back-to-back games,
home-and-home against the Bulls,'' Chapman said. ``I wasn't
playing, but I was on the trip to Chicago and LaBradford Smith had
something like 38 points against Michael.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still beat us, and we went back to Washington for a game
the next night. I went in early to get treatment (for an injury)
and got there about 2{ hours early, and Michael was already there
shooting. You just had the feeling he was embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came out and scored 36 in the first three quarters and held
LaBradford to four or five points. It was real personal for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have to do that. He didn't need to do that. He's the
best player in the world. But inside him, a fire burns that a lot
of people don't have, especially guys with his kind of talent. He
put on a show.''
</P>
<P>
   It's what Jordan always did best.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the greatest player because he could do it on both ends
of the floor,'' Ainge said. ``But he was also the most
entertaining, the most exciting player. He could do all that
acrobatic stuff, but he was also the toughest competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has a favorite Jordan memory. He scored 63 in the
playoffs against Boston, when Ainge guarded him for much of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Kleine's is of Jordan's final 42 seconds: ``We're down three, he
scores on a drive to the basket, steals the ball from (Utah's Karl)
Malone, then hits the game-winning shot. That's as good as it
gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd's is of his first game against Jordan: ``I remember the
first time I guarded him my rookie year (with Dallas). We switched
(defensively), and I was on him. He always likes to let you know
when you're a rookie. He said, `I got a young guy here.' I didn't
want him to do anything to get the crowd excited, so I conceded the
jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things stick in your mind. I just remember somebody
yelled, `Switch.' You don't want to hear `Switch' when No. 23 is
coming across the lane.''
</P>
<P>
   Suns President Jerry Colangelo, who began his NBA career with
the Bulls, said there will be only one Jordan. But the game will go
on, and new stars will emerge, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Who takes over?' '' Colangelo said. ``Nobody
takes over. People, things, situations evolve. We may not know who,
or what, or what circumstances, but somewhere in the world, there
is somebody dribbling a basketball who will no doubt have a
tremendous impact one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe his name is Zeke. &QL;

ABORTION DOCTOR ARRESTED ON MANSLAUGHTER CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSIE STECKNER  
 and JODIE SNYDER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The doctor and clinic administrator accused of
allowing a patient to bleed to death after an abortion have been
indicted and arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Biskind, a Cleveland gynecologist who regularly flew to
Phoenix to perform abortions at the A-Z Women's Center, and Carol
Stuart, were indicted on manslaughter charges Monday in the death
of Lou Anne Herron.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can make mistakes. You don't hold people criminally
responsible for innocent mistakes,'' County Attorney Rick Romley
said at a news conference late Tuesday. ``The conduct by Dr.
Biskind is so outrageous, it shocks the conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our opinion that Lou Anne Herron did not have to die.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Stuart, Romley said the administrator was more concerned
with the interest of the clinic than with Herron's medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind was arrested Tuesday afternoon at his winter home in
Scottsdale; Stuart also was arrested Tuesday in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation is still pending into a near-abortion at the
clinic in which Biskind attempted to abort a fetus that was 37
weeks old. Biskind later said he believed the fetus was no more
than 24 weeks, but when the abortion proved too difficult he ended
up delivering a full-term baby girl.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart also was at the clinic the day of the near-abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In the Herron case, employees have described for police a scene
of medical chaos at the clinic: inexperienced staff members, a
doctor too busy eating lunch to check on his patient, an
administrator who sought help from a medical assistant 20 minutes
away instead of calling 911 or taking Herron to the hospital across
the street.
</P>
<P>
   Romley also said he will expand the criminal investigations to
include the clinic's owner, Moshe Hachamovitch, a New York abortion
doctor whose other clinics in Texas and New York have had their
share of problems.
</P>
<P>
   The death of a 19-year-old patient at one clinic in New York
prompted state medical officials to revoke Hachamovitch's license
for a month, although the doctor is fighting that action and still
practicing medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, state health officials went to court to shut down one
of his clinics after finding conditions so unsanitary that patient
care was endangered. That state investigation came on the heels of
the death of a 15-year-old patient.
</P>
<P>
   Hachamovitch was not at the Phoenix clinic, near 10th Street and
McDowell Road, during either of the incidents. But according to a
Phoenix police investigation by Detective Mark Stribling,
Hachamovitch may have known about Herron prior to her abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Employees told police that, based on ultrasound results, they
believed Herron was too far along in her pregnancy for a legal
abortion. But when they challenged Stuart, they were told by her
that Herron was a private patient of Hachamovitch's.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, nurse Victoria Kimball, who quit A-Z after Herron's
death and who went public with her concerns, said she was ``happy
that justice was being served.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of thing should not have happened,'' she said.
``They need to take away the perpetrators of this. Sometimes
justice doesn't always work, but I am glad that it did in this
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Biskind's attorney declined to comment Tuesday night; Stuart's
attorney could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Romley said Biskind and Stuart are facing manslaughter charges,
rather than the lesser charge of criminal negligence, because the
case meets the standard of showing ``reckless disregard for life.''
</P>
<P>
   The penalties for manslaughter range from probation to 12 years
in prison. Bond has been set for each at $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Problems began at A-Z in April, when Herron, 33, a mother of
two, sought a late-term abortion.
</P>
<P>
   She made several visits to the McDowell Road clinic and the
affiliated clinic in Glendale for ultrasounds. Employees told
police that the results ranged from 26 weeks to 24 weeks and two
days. They said that Biskind chose one of the ultrasounds and that
the abortion was later performed.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after the procedure, employees said, Herron
began to have complications and was bleeding heavily. For the next
three hours, she complained about being in pain, worried that her
legs were numb and cried out for help.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't a registered nurse on duty, and inexperienced
employees said they could not help her. They said they pleaded with
Stuart to call 911. Instead, Stuart called in a medical assistant
at an affiliated office in Scottsdale and then paged Biskind for
guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind, who already had left the clinic, reportedly told an
employee over the phone, ``Well what do you want me to do? Call
911,'' according to the Phoenix police report.
</P>
<P>
   Then in June, the clinic had more troubles with the
near-abortion of a full-term baby. The baby suffered
non-life-threatening injuries and later was adopted.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Hachamovitch was evicted from the McDowell Road office
complex. He later was forced to close the west Phoenix and
Scottsdale clinics because he said no doctors would work for him.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Biskind gave up his Arizona medical license, avoiding
a state medical board probe into Herron's death. A month later, he
surrendered his medical license in his home state of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart, meanwhile, left A-Z when it closed and took a job as a
youth counselor.
</P>
<P>
   Herron's family is expected to file a lawsuit naming
Hachamovitch, Biskind and Stuart.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Board of Medical Examiners, meanwhile, is
investigating two complaints against Hachamovitch of improper
and/or inadequate supervision or collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind had come to the attention of the Arizona Board of
Medical Examiners several times for various complaints. The most
severe discipline was a censure in 1996 for gross negligence after
the death of another patient, Lisa Bardsley. &QL;

OLYMPIAN RETURNS TO GYM OF HER YOUTH  
 NOW GYMNAST IS A TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jaycie Phelps is living in Tempe and spending most every day at
Desert Devils Gymnastics in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Just like she did when she was 12.
</P>
<P>
   But at 19, Phelps owns a house 10 minutes from Arizona State,
where she will begin college in the fall. She is coaching the
Desert Devils elites, whereas seven years ago she was the youngest
of an astounding 1992 team that produced collegiate All-Americans
Sandy Woolsey, Elizabeth Crandall, Kim Arnold and Tiffany Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   She is even an investor in SportsTech International, now the
parent company of Desert Devils, which is moving forward with plans
for an elite multisport training complex in north Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   She's also been involved in a yearlong romance with Mesa's Jason
Gatson, who in 1997 at age 17 became the youngest American male
gymnast to compete at a World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   So while the geography is the same for Phelps, life is vastly
different.
</P>
<P>
   She is an adult, counseling 1996 Olympic teammate Dominique
Moceanu through the ugly separation from her father and in the
process gaining an increased appreciation for how her parents
handled the abnormalities inherent with elite athletic training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to help as much as I can,'' said Phelps, who next to
Moceanu was the youngest of the Magnificent Seven that won the
Olympic women's team gold medal in Atlanta. ``She's really confused
about everything in life right now. She doesn't know if she wants
to do gymnastics. She wants to, but then again, she wants to be a
normal kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are obviously some things I missed in high school, like
homecoming, but it doesn't bother me because I've gotten to do so
much more. My parents have been supportive of my decisions and
didn't get upset if I made a mistake in competition. Everything
looked good to them. I've definitely had a great life up to this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Reese's Gymnastics Cup on Saturday at Wells Fargo Arena
proves to be Phelps' farewell to competitive gymnastics, she is
ready to move on and able to say: ``I accomplished more than I set
out to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Phelps moved from Indiana to Arizona with her mother,
Cheryl, to train at Desert Devils under the late Stormy Eaton. But
Jaycie missed her father, Jack, and others in the family and
returned to the Midwest to train for the Olympics under Mary Lee
Tracy at the Cincinnati Gymnastics Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I lived out there before, I loved it and said I would end
up out here anyway,'' Phelps said.
</P>
<P>
   Having remained friends with Eaton's son, Geoff, who became
owner-head coach at Desert Devils after his father died in 1995,
Phelps called last year to say she planned to enroll at ASU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her, `You'd better be working for me,' '' Eaton said.
Phelps quickly agreed, even delaying classes to concentrate on a
job she ``wasn't sure I'd like as much as I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Phelps is coaching not only the half-dozen Desert Devils
elite/level 10 gymnasts, including Chelsea Otto, who was 24th in
juniors at the 1998 U.S. Championships, but also teaming with
Eaton's wife, Shelly, to motivate a group of level 4s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can coach a great athlete,'' Eaton said. ``The real
coaching is at the lower levels. I wanted to put Jaycie on a young
group of kids, and she rose to the occasion. She immediately turned
their whole view of gymnastics, brightened their spirits and got
them going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a gold medalist, someone who's reached the
cream of the crop, maintain the same disposition like Jaycie. You
wouldn't know she's ever done anything. She has a crystal-clear
personality and view of life. She's going to be a brilliant coach.
We're thrilled to have her, and she's got a place here as long as
she wants it.''
</P>
<P>
   Phelps' competitive career has been on hold since December 1997,
when she had surgery to replaced the meniscus in her left knee. It
was in '97 that she met and exchanged Internet addresses with
Gatson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been dating for over a year, so I guess you can say
we're an item,'' said Phelps of a relationship that was the subject
of a ``Parade'' magazine Q&AMP;A last month.
</P>
<P>
   Gatson, also entered in the Reese's Cup, lives at the U.S.
Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, so the two see each
other once a month and at holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The all-around silver medalist and floor exercise/high bar
champion at the 1998 U.S. Championships, Gatson seemingly is a lock
for the 2000 Olympics. Phelps can relate to the pressure he faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us more to talk about,'' Phelps said. ``He's
seriously training and I'm not really, so I can help him to relax a
little.''
</P>
<P>
   Phelps has been cleared by her doctor to ``do whatever I can''
and plans to compete on uneven parallel bars and balance beam with
watered-down dismounts Saturday. She is paired with 16-year-old
Vanessa Atler, the 1998 Goodwill Games gold medalist on vault and
floor exercise and '97 co-national all-around champion.
</P>
<P>
   Her Magnificent Seven teammates Amanda Borden, an ASU student
and manager of the Sun Devils team, and Amy Chow also are in the
field. Moceanu and Shannon Miller are appearing to sign
autographs. &QL;

TKACHUK VOWS TO RETURN NEXT WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB McMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Captain Coyote is almost ready to return to the lineup. Left
wing Keith Tkachuk, sidelined since Dec. 28 because of a fractured
rib, said he expects to play next week when the Coyotes host the
St. Louis Blues.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk, injured when he was cross checked from behind by
Mattias Norstrom of the Los Angeles Kings, will miss three more
games, including tonight's match-up with the Pittsburgh Penguins,
and games Friday at Nashville and Sunday at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Without Tkachuk, Phoenix is 3-6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm almost there,'' said Tkachuk, who practiced for the third
consecutive day Tuesday, when he was selected to participate in his
third consecutive All-Star Game. ``I'm still a little sore, but
that's to be expected. The bottom line is, I'm playing Tuesday.
That's my target date, and I don't plan on missing it.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Jagr-meister &QL;  &QL; 
Center Jeremy Roenick, who will join Tkachuk as a reserve for the
North American All-Star squad, said the Coyotes will have their
work cut out tonight against the Penguins and perennial All-Star
Jaromir Jagr.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best one-on-on player in the game in terms of
strength and puck handling,'' Roenick said of Jagr, who ranks third
in the league in scoring with 50 points. ``We have to make sure we
don't let him hold the puck too long or let him get into the open,
because he's the kind of guy who can kill you.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Waiting for 400 &QL;  &QL; 
With just three goals in his past 15 games, veteran Rick Tocchet
remains three goals shy of the 400-goal milestone for his career.
The wait, he admits, has been bothersome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been thinking about it lately, but before I was,''
said Tocchet, third on the team with 12 goals. ``The last 10 games,
I just haven't been getting the chances I was earlier, and I'm
starting to get frustrated. It's not like I'm not going to the net
or anything. The puck's just not bouncing my way. But it's going to
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always prided myself on being a consistent scorer, not
going into too many prolonged slumps. So hopefully I can get over
this and start bagging some.'' &QL;  &QL; 
No O in Oleg &QL;  &QL; 
After scoring four goals and five points in his first seven games,
defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky has managed just one goal and seven
assists in his past 30 games. Part of the problem has been the
Coyotes' recent woes on the power play (0 for 32). Another reason
is the team's tight defensive system once they get a lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the players have to fit the system, the system can't fit
the player,'' Tverdovsky said. ``It's working. But individually, it
can't always be great for everybody.'' &QL;  &QL;

<P>
   On Thursday, Arizona State's Rob Evans will coach a basketball
team for the first time against a Lute Olson squad when the Sun
Devils play host to Arizona. But Evans and Olson are
well-acquainted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lute and I have gone back a long way,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Evans said, Olson tried to hire him.
</P>
<P>
   Olson was head coach at Iowa, which had just gone to the Final
Four. Evans was an assistant coach at Texas Tech. Evans said Olson
offered him a job as an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   After thinking it over for no more than 15 or 20 minutes, Evans
said no, thank you. He reasoned that his wife, Carolyn (who was
working toward a degree), and their children, Damon and Amber, were
better off staying in Lubbock, Texas, instead of moving to Iowa
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just decided that was the best place for my family,'' he
said. ``My family's the most important thing to me, and my kids
were doing tremendous in school, my wife was doing well in the
community and in school.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was more to it than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like at that particular point, I was needed more at
Texas Tech,'' Evans said. ``Texas Tech was struggling, trying to
get national recognition. And I felt like with my recruiting
ability in that area, especially being from New Mexico, I was
needed more there.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said Iowa assistant Ken Burmeister ``told me I was nuts''
for turning down the offer, because it would have led to a head
coaching job more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I felt I was going to get a head coaching job if I
deserved it, regardless of where I was,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Olson's memory was a little fuzzy about offering Evans a job at
Iowa, but he did recall talking to Evans in 1988 when Olson was at
Arizona. Again, he had just been to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is, we had been in contact to try to get him
hired,'' Olson said. ``He's always done a good job and he's always
done it in a first-class way.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans had been at Texas Tech for five years when he turned down
the Iowa offer, 13 when Olson again asked. He had become in great
demand _ as an assistant. But that wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting a lot of overtures,'' he said. ``I wasn't
interested in becoming an assistant coach. I had that job. I was
interested in becoming a head coach.''
</P>
<P>
   It finally happened in 1992 when Evans was hired at Mississippi,
but only after he didn't get the Texas Tech job and went to
Oklahoma State to work as Eddie Sutton's assistant for two years.
</P>
<P>
   There is another link between Evans and Olson, a more recent
one. Wildcats forward Michael Wright is probably making the
greatest impact of any freshman in the Pac-10, leading them all in
scoring and rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   But before he started playing for Olson, Wright played for
Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the 6-foot-7, 235-pound Wright was the most
valuable player on the USA Basketball Men's Junior World
Championship qualifying team that won the gold medal in the
Dominican Republic. Jim Boeheim of Syracuse was head coach. Evans
was an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael's a tough kid,'' Evans said. ``He's really a tough
kid. A very, very hard-working kid. Strong. He was probably the
best player we had, and we had some good ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the high school kids on the team, Wright was the most
serious-minded, Evans said. ``He's a very mature freshman.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans described Wright as quiet and introspective, but the two
developed a strong relationship. It started when Wright, who is
from Chicago, asked Evans about Auvee Story, a transfer from
Illinois also from Chicago now enrolled at ASU and sitting out the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got along pretty well,'' Wright said. ``I'm kind of quiet,
and he tried to get stuff out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   A left-hander, Wright said Evans got him to work on using his
right hand, developing the 15-foot jump shot and defense. Olson
stresses the same things and, like Evans, marvels at his attitude
and work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Wright,'' said Olson, ``wants to be the best player he
can possibly be.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Evans already knew that. &QL;

5 RESERVES AVAILABLE TO BROWNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time the NFL had an expansion draft, then-Cardinals
Coach Buddy Ryan left players in his doghouse on the unprotected
list.
</P>
<P>
   He made starting quarterback Steve Beuerlein available, and
Jacksonville chose him with the first pick in the 1995 expansion
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan also planned to leave wide receiver Ricky Proehl
unprotected but then removed him at the last second when he
realized Proehl had trade value. Proehl was sent to the Seattle
Seahawks for a 1995 fourth-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals aren't giving away any starters to Cleveland in
this year's expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   The team announced Tuesday that it didn't protect defensive
tackle Jerry Drake, linebacker Terry Irving, wide receiver Fred
Brock, cornerback J.B. Brown and tight end Jarius Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   Each team was required to submit their unprotected list to
Cleveland by Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Only Brown and Drake started any games this season. Brown had
six starts in place of injured Tom Knight at right cornerback.
Drake started the season opener at Dallas in place of Andre
Wadsworth but suffered a back injury and was placed on the injured
reserve list.
</P>
<P>
   If the Browns take any of the players in the Feb. 9 draft, the
Cardinals can pull another player off the list. They cannot lose
more than two players. &QL; 
Medical update &QL; 
Starting outside linebacker Jamir Miller is expected to see Dr.
Robert Wilson, a hand and wrist specialist in Phoenix, later this
week to see whether he needs off-season surgery on his dislocated
left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals medical personnel are hopeful that kicker Joe Nedney,
recovering from a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left
(kicking) leg, will be ready for the start of training camp in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Eric Swann, also recovering from knee surgery,
will remain on crutches for at least another month. &QL; 
Attention-getter &QL;  &QL; 
With nine games against eight playoff teams next season, Cardinals
Coach Vince Tobin knows his team will be playing one of the NFL's
tougher schedules.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals play San Francisco, Green Bay, Buffalo, New
England, the New York Jets, Atlanta, Miami and Dallas twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would prefer to play the teams you can beat the easiest,''
he said. ``But one thing this schedule does is get the attention of
the players in the off-season. They enjoyed making the playoffs and
getting to the `Final Eight' and want to do it again. So, they know
the have to come in prepared and ready.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Prime time &QL;  &QL; 
An ABC TV official said Tuesday that the network hopes to televise
the Cardinals' home game against the 49ers on Monday Night Football
next season.
</P>
<P>
   The network official said it would be ``great to have a
quarterback who's been compared to Joe Montana (Jake Plummer)
against Montana's (old) team.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Best wishes &QL;  &QL; 
Return specialist Eric Metcalf, also the team's No. 3 receiver,
likely has played his last game with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   His contract is up next month, and he struggled on kick and punt
returns for most of the season. The Cardinals were 22nd in the
league in kick returns and 29th in punt returns in the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf had his best punt return in last Sunday's NFC playoff
loss at Minnesota, a 36-yarder that set up a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our return game needs to be improved,'' Tobin said. &QL;  &QL; 
Endorsement &QL;  &QL; 
Miller said he thinks the Chicago Bears should give defensive
coordinator Dave McGinnis strong consideration for their head
coaching position.
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis is scheduled to interview today or Thursday in Phoenix
with Bears Vice President Mark Hatley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to see him go, but if he does, it would make the
Bears a better team,'' Miller said. ``I always wish good luck for
someone who can improve their situation.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Moonlighting &QL;  &QL; 
Rookie cornerback Corey Chavous has been hired to co-host an NFL
draft show with Dallas radio personality Norm Hitzges.
</P>
<P>
   Chavous, who has a film library of 400 tapes, hopes to have a
career in broadcasting when he's finished in the NFL. &QL;  &QL;

TKACHUK, ROENICK NAMED ALL-STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today, they are the Fabulous Five.
</P>
<P>
   But hit the rewind button and review your memory banks about
Keith Tkachuk, Jeremy Roenick, Teppo Numminen, Nikolai Khabibulin
and Coach Jim Schoenfeld, the five men who will represent the
Coyotes at this month's NHL All-Star Game in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   One of them (Tkachuk) was labeled as a greedy money-grubber who
dominated the sports pages last summer with his second
controversial holdout in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Another (Roenick) recently acknowledged that all he used to care
about was making money, looking good and playing well individually
without a care about how his team made out.
</P>
<P>
   One of them (Numminen) made so many headlines about being the
most underrated defenseman in the league, it made his hard-luck
story start to sound like overkill.
</P>
<P>
   Another (Khabibulin) is a nice enough fellow, but a strangely
silent star who has yet to melt the media, the same guy who said,
when asked three years ago if he knew what a real coyote was, said,
``It is big cat with claws, duh?''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is their boss (Schoenfeld), a coach who nearly
lost his job a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fab Five or the Misfits? Call them what you want, but they're
all headed toward hockey heaven on Jan. 24, when they will
participate in the 49th annual midseason classic at the Ice Palace
in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``After everything we've went through in the past year, this
just makes it all that much better,'' Coyotes veteran Rick Tocchet
said. ``I can't tell you how happy I am for all the guys. They all
deserve it. It's a great reward for our team, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk and Roenick on Tuesday were named as reserves for the
North American All-Star squad. A day earlier, Numminen and
Khabibulin were named to the World All-Star team. Schoenfeld,
meanwhile, will serve as an assistant coach for the North American
team, a selection based on the Coyotes' winning percentage a few
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The four player selections are the most ever in the
organization's 20-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor. It's a privilege to play in,'' said Tkachuk,
who will be making his third straight All-Star trip despite
presently being sidelined because of a cracked rib. ``It's
definitely something me and my family are going to enjoy once we
get there. I'm looking forward to playing with a bunch of players
you never really get to play with _ or play against.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Numminen and Khabibulin, who for once, will be on opposite
sides of the ice from Tkachuk and Roenick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Keith's been joking around lately, saying he's going to
take a run at me,'' Numminen said, adding his own snappy comeback
by saying, ``I'm going to play it tough on him and try and move his
big butt out from the front of our net if he parks it there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk couldn't resist adding a friendly shot in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason Teppo's there,'' he said, ``is because he's
one of the commissioner's special picks.''
</P>
<P>
   All kidding aside, the selections are a direct result of the
Coyotes' impressive 22-10-5 record, which represents their best
start in franchise history. A big part of that has been a
rededication to the game and the team by players such as Tkachuk
and Roenick and others, who claim all that matters now in their
careers is winning the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a while for me, but I'm excited, I'm going to soak
it up and it's something I had to work really hard for,'' said
Roenick, who leads the Coyotes in scoring with 40 points and will
be making his fifth All-Star appearance _ his first in five years.
``It wasn't one of my goals, though. My goals were very limited
this year. I just wanted to be the best player I can be and help my
team win the Stanley Cup, that's it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel very fortunate. If I knew who to thank, I'd thank
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken Khabibulin, coming off a 1-0 shutout over
Buffalo and fellow All-Star Dominik Hasek on Monday, sounded more
like Charles Barkley than himself when asked for his reaction to
making his second straight All-Star appearance. Khabibulin said
after a long pause:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well . . . I think I deserve it.'' &QL;

FAIRY TALE ENDS HAPPILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The end comes just like it should. As a fairy tale. A jump shot
that wins a championship. A hero smart enough to understand that
timing can be his friend, and time can be his enemy.
</P>
<P>
   And this time, Michael Jordan is not coming back. The greatest
basketball player ever to lace up his shoes, the second-most
influential athlete in world history, is done.
</P>
<P>
   Take a moment to understand the implications, the magnitude of
his career. How your grandchildren will ask about Jordan. If you're
lucky, at some point, you set the VCR and labeled the tape.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a superstar gets it right. For the first time since Jim
Brown, one who doesn't push the envelope of greatness until it is
stained with tragedy. Remember: A bloated Babe Ruth flailing away.
Muhammad Ali _ the only athlete whose impact exceeded Jordan's _
getting pummeled by Larry Holmes. Willie Mays thrown out at home
plate in a Mets jersey, looking gray and weary. Jesse Owens turned
circus freak, racing horses to make a buck. Pete Rose, manager,
penciling himself in the lineup until his career average threatens
to dip below .300. Joe Montana, in a Chiefs jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan deserves this. Not for all the clutch shots that almost
became cliche. Not for the highlight films. Not even for the six
championships when his mental will was simply impenetrable, when
even Pat Riley admitted that no other team would win a title until
Jordan retired.
</P>
<P>
   He deserves this because, for all the fame and money, he
remained remarkably grounded. The fame and money that turned
Michael Jackson into God knows what, that made Prince change his
name to a symbol, the kind that will chew up all sensibility and
leave behind nothing but ego.
</P>
<P>
   With Jordan, it never happened. He never forgot to work. To get
better. To practice as hard as he played. To never make excuses.
His priority started with winning, ended with winning, and
everything in between was a means to that end.
</P>
<P>
   He could be mean-spirited to his teammates. He once gave Steve
Kerr a black eye in practice. He once threw the ball at Luc
Longley's head. He once told his teammates not to pass to Bill
Cartwright.
</P>
<P>
   Until you met his intensity, until you understood the sacrifice
to win, he could be downright cruel.
</P>
<P>
   And while he would remind everybody that he was king of the
court, he never acted like he was a better person than you. That is
the greatest tribute to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   His intimacy with media broke down after his father died, amid
rampant speculation that his penchant for gambling somehow
precipitated a senseless killing. It eroded a bit when national
magazines made fun of his attempt to play baseball, only the
bravest thing he's ever done. And it was never the same when he
came back, when the Bulls became bigger than life, when the media
horde became too much to handle on an individual basis.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan was always forthright and honest, always shared
himself, treating every question with dignity. Much of this was due
to his image, the one he kept squeaky clean for corporate purposes.
But most of it was real.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Brooklyn, raised in North Carolina. A kid who
shied away from girls, afraid they'd make fun of his big ears. A
kid cut from his high school basketball team, who, no matter how
far he traveled, always hung on to his roots.
</P>
<P>
   One day, during his attempt to play baseball, a Japanese
reporter asked Jordan about the game of . Jordan could've rolled
his eyes, laughed, disregarded the strange query. Instead, he broke
into a 45-second answer, expounding on the virtues of two paddles
and a little plastic ball.
</P>
<P>
   Other memories:
</P>
<P>
   The day he slapped me in the back of the head for no reason, so
hard that I saw stars. The day he dragged me off the practice court
in a headlock, just for fun. The night in a bar when I introduced
Jordan to my wife and she almost fainted. The moments when he came
to bat for the Chicago White Sox, when a baseball stadium would go
completely silent.
</P>
<P>
   He loved talking trash. He loved throwing barbs around the
locker room, to see who would engage in a war of insults. And, of
course, he loved challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan also loves playing the martyr. When he walked
away from baseball, he said it was because of a labor impasse,
because the White Sox wanted him to side with management.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, Jordan would never have been successful in baseball.
Good maybe, but not great. That much was clear, and the labor
skirmish was a perfect out.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to 1998, and Jordan is in a similar situation. A
league full of copycats and imitators, young players who bought
into the dunks and the flash but never understood that Jordan was
really about winning. A league full of rich kids who are bathing in
money because of Jordan, rich kids who have ridden his coattails
and haven't proved a damn thing. A league where the commissioner,
upon announcing the end of the lockout, begged Jordan to return.
</P>
<P>
   If he came back, he would've been the bridge to recovery. He
wouldn't have made all the animosity go away, but he would've been
the perfect salve for all the wounds. And, come now, why would he
want to help the owners like that? Especially the owner and general
manager in Chicago, an owner he's grown to loathe and a general
manager he's always despised.
</P>
<P>
   It's always been this way. Fight Jordan and he leaves you
bloody.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is also shrewd enough to know that he is out of shape.
That he turned his private, indoor basketball court into a cigar
bar. That the Indiana Pacers have been practicing six days a week
during the lockout. That his career can't end like so many others.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the end, he went from burning Bryon Russell to smoking
Cuban cigars. Smart enough to turn his career into a fairy tale.
With the ending intact. &QL;

COMPUTER HACKER GETS FIVE-MONTH JAIL TERM
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A federal judge sentenced computer hacker Justin
Petersen on Tuesday to five months in jail, saying the former FBI
informant was ``sticking his thumb at the system'' during his
latest run from the law.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen was a fugitive from Sept. 30 until Dec. 11, when U.S.
marshals arrested him in a suburban Studio City apartment. The
38-year-old already has served 35 months in prison for hacking into
a bank to get $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson didn't hand down the
two-year sentence that he could have, he compared Petersen to a
drug addict who refuses to be helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're going to teach him a lesson . . . there's
nothing at this point, absent a miracle, that would bring him back,
in my view.''
</P>
<P>
   The self-proclaimed playboy hacker's Web site is filled with
pictures of him accompanied by beautiful women at Sunset Strip
nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen admitted to Wilson that he fled after violating the
terms of his supervised release from prison, which required that he
get a steady job and pay about $40,000 to his victims.
</P>
<P>
   He disappeared in September, after a hearing at which Wilson
ordered him to go to a halfway house and possibly seek
psychological counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen's lawyer, Nathan Hochman, pointed out that his client
was ``a few keystrokes away from committing a crime'' after his
1997 release, but chose not to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Hochman said Petersen was beaten the last time he was in prison
because of his role as an FBI informant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lives in fear of physical attack,'' the attorney said. ``If
he goes back to this Texas facility, he goes as a marked man.''

THE `MOOSE' IS LOOSE FOR EXPANSION DRAFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Fullback Daryl Johnston battled back from a
severe neck injury to start 16 games for the Cowboys this season.
Now, he faces the possibility that his career with the Cowboys
might be finished.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, 32, joined receiver Billy Davis as the only starters
the Cowboys will expose to the league's veteran player draft for
the expansion Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Also left unprotected for the Feb. 9 draft were defensive
linemen Antonio Anderson and Hurvin McCormack and center Clay
Shiver. The Browns can draft no more than two players from any
team, so there is a chance all five could remain with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones wouldn't go into any specifics about
his decisions but said the process was difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult decision might have been regarding Johnston,
a 10-year veteran and one of the team's most popular players. But
Johnston's agent, Leigh Steinberg, indicated that the Cowboys
thought Johnston's $1.65 million salary for next season was too
high.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said the Cowboys put Johnston on the expansion list
after trying to find a way to reduce his salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, it was made clear that it was an economic
issue,'' Steinberg said. ``Daryl was sort of given a choice: cut
his salary dramatically or put him on the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made it clear that they value Daryl, just not at those
economics.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones did not say if the decision was made in an attempt to
reduce Johnston's salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We considered a lot of things _ cap impact, salary impact,
where they are in their career, the entire gamut went into it,''
Jones said. ``Our strategy was to expose players in the best
interest of the team, and it was convoluted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one appreciates what D.J. is about on and off the field
\Rmore than we do\S,'' Jones said. ``It goes without saying what
kind of player we think Daryl is, and he enjoyed a very productive
year. I reiterate it was a very difficult decision. I visited with
him a couple of times. I know he understands the things we took
into consideration, whether he agrees or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have 43 players already under contract for 1999 at a
cap impact of roughly $61 million. The cap is expected to be $57.5
million. If taken by the Browns, Johnston's entire salary would
move to the Browns' cap.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said Johnston, who had neck surgery during the 1997
season, is not bitter and still wants to finish his career with the
Cowboys. Steinberg said Johnston feels he has a lot of good
football left and would report to the Browns if selected.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on Davis is considered to be based on money and
production. Davis, who is expected to count $1.1 million against
the cap next season, caught 39 passes for 691 yards and three
touchdowns in his first season as a starter. However, he tailed off
at the end of the season and is not expected to retain his starting
job.
</P>
<P>
   His salary is thought to be too high for a backup receiver and
special teams player _ though the Browns could come to the same
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   McCormack is the only other salary concern on the list, as the
Cowboys could save $750,000 if the backup defensive tackle is
selected.
</P>
<P>
   Shiver, a restricted free agent who could earn roughly $500,000
next season if the Cowboys re-sign him, lost his starting job to
Mike Kiselak and is not considered part of the Cowboys' future.
Anderson dropped on the depth chart after suffering a knee injury
midway through the season and finished as a third-string player at
end and tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Notable for not being on the list is cornerback Kevin Smith, who
lost his starting job to Kevin Mathis and counts $3.3 million
against the cap next season. Smith's presence and salary for next
season could be justified because Mathis is earning the minimum and
still is unproven. It is also reasonable to want three experienced
cornerbacks on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jones acknowledged players were not exposed at certain
positions because the Cowboys didn't want to reveal what their
off-season plans were for
</P>
<P>
   free agency or the draft.
</P>
<P>
   He also added that not being on the list doesn't guarantee a
player a roster spot for next season. Middle linebacker Fred
Strickland, set to make $1.1 million next year, could be released.

JORDAN LEAVES NOTHING BUT NET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   History, and a well-worn videotape, will show Michael Jordan's
last NBA shot was good. Maybe even perfect. History offers that
indelible final image of an unparalleled career.
</P>
<P>
   History lies. Shut off the VCR.
</P>
<P>
   That Michael Jordan is one of the greatest players, if not
!ital!the greatest player ever, is indisputable. That he won six
titles in six full seasons, and five legue MVP trophies are simple,
impressive facts.
</P>
<P>
   And that he won the last game of his career with a
picture-perfect jumper to clinch championship No. 6 is a matter of
record.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Jordan doesn't leave the NBA on that shot.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves now _ not in June but in January. Not clutching the
Larry O'Brien trophy, but letting the last great challenge of his
career slip away _ the chance to rescue the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   While Jordan vacationed and golfed and chewed Cuban cigars these
past few months, the league that made him an immensely wealthy
global icon was busy destroying itself. A six-month labor war has
left the NBA's image in tatters, its relationship with fans
strained. Owners are greedy, players are greedy. Players choke
coaches, skip practices and insult fans.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA needs a savior, a superhero _ and the only man who fits
the description is hanging up his cape.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan is taking his last shot today, and it's big, fat
airball.
</P>
<P>
   Even his peers recognize it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad thing,'' said the Lakers' Eddie Jones, ``because
especially what basketball is at this point right now, Michael
Jordan is desperately needed. It's a shame that everything went
down (with the lockout). We lose so many fans and Mike could bring
all of the fans back, and he's not with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Interesting that Jordan, a superstar who was willing to give
Steve Kerr the game-winning shot in 1997, is so selfish off the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Many will argue to the contrary, will say Jordan must be piously
selfless to pass up a guaranteed $35 million and the chance for a
seventh championship ring.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense. Jordan is a corporation unto himself, rich beyond
belief. Passing up $35 million is no sacrifice. Returning for
another season when he doesn't need the money, or the records, or
the ring, or the acclaim, that would be the truly sefless act.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Jordan tosses up an airball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put ourselves in a hard predicament right now,'' the
Lakers' Kobe Bryant said. ``But the league has always made it. . .
He's not here, so we've got to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball faced the same battle three years ago, after a strike
canceled the 1994 World Series. The damage was immense and
attendance plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   But there was Cal Ripken Jr., breaking the
consecutive-games-played record the next season, and the ill
feelings seemed to fade along with Lou Gehrig's record. And then
Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa came along last year chasing Roger
Maris and finished the job. The slate was wiped clean. The
once-bitter American public went from forgive to forget in the
space of a single September.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA stands where baseball did. An ESPN online poll showed 54
percent of those voting had ``no interest'' in the
lockout-shortened season. Another 27.5 percent were ``mildly
interested.'' A CNN-SI poll was more ominous: 55 percent said yes
when asked, ``Without Michael Jordan, is the NBA doomed?''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA needs Ripken and McGwire and Babe Ruth rolled into one.
But he's sunning himself in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another poll asked who will fill Jordan's shoes. Two-thirds
said ``nobody.'' And former Jordan teammate Steve Kerr had to
agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no replacing Michael Jordan,'' Kerr said. ``Can the
league go on? It has to. Will it be better? No way. We're talking
about the best, most charismatic player ever. That's a lot to
overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern knows as much. He practically begged
Jordan to return last week. But even the NBA's administrative MVP
couldn't change Jordan's mind.
</P>
<P>
   So Jordan will say goodbye today to the NBA, while the league
that gave birth to ``his Airness'' lies in a ditch, bleeding
profusely from self-inflicted wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Only a clutch player like Jordan can save it. But Jordan has
chosen the easy path, chosen not to risk it all for one more
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Jordan for that game-winner last June if it helps. But
let the record reflect Jordan took his last NBA shot today, Jan.
13, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Let the record show that shot was an airball.

CATCHING THE SPIRIT OF A CENTURY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 17) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   What a world to step into, if you were inquisitive. And at the
beginning of the 1920s, Duke Ellington, touched by genius and
ambition, prepared by education and class privilege, walked into
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine it from the perspective of a young musician: the
recording industry was flowering, radio had burst onto the scene.
Suddenly it was possible to live in Mississippi and know what was
happening in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Industry was boiling, cars, airplanes and telephones were
redefining personal freedom. And not only was the Harlem
Renaissance on its well-publicized way, with a huge surge of
artistic production, but the attentions of whites were fixed on
black creativity. There was an audience for the new arts, black and
white, and an audience with money.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country different musical styles were flourishing.
Melodies were everywhere, from childrens' songs, vaudeville tunes,
ragtime compositions, pop pieces, work chants, parlor piano hits,
river sounding chants, Broadway and light classical music to ring
shouts and gospel.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, the improvisational impulse had produced a
sophisticated polyphonic music, and two improvising masters, Sidney
Bechet and Louis Armstrong, had both put their genius on record by
1923. In New York, symphonic jazz played by Paul Whiteman and
others wrestled with large dance bands and ragtime orchestras for
supremacy. The composer James Reece Europe was experimenting with a
large orchestra, and Wilbur Sweatman, Will Marion Cook and Prince's
Band were recording during the teens and 20s, with black and white
bands borrowing from each other.
</P>
<P>
   Itinerant musicians, whether they be boogie pianists schooled in
Southern turpentine camps or Mississippi blues men, toured the
country. Early jazz orchestras, including the band of Fletcher
Henderson, were working. Urban blues were selling millions of
copies, and in Europe the jazz explosion was already drawing
touring bands from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When Duke Ellington, fresh from Washington, arrived in New York
in 1923, it was the present and future cultural capital of the
world. He began playing in what were known as black and tans,
joints that catered to black and white audiences, and in 1927, just
a year after his first wobbly recordings under his own name, he
fell into the job that changed American cultural history. King
Oliver rejected an offer to work in Harlem's whites-only Cotton
Club, and Ellington, then 28, took the job.
</P>
<P>
   It was a huge undertaking: he had to prepare nightly broadcasts
for a national audience and music for the chorus and specialty
dancing as well as collaborate with the songwriters Jimmy McHugh
and Dorothy Fields. Most important, he had to add a musical
background to the stereotype-laden narratives that powered the
black reviews for the white audiences.
</P>
<P>
   He was creating the ``jungle sound'' that, stripped of its
racial context, sounds radical to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Ellington turned to what he knew, taking from orchestral jazz
and incorporating the vocal aspect of the New Orleans style. In his
trumpeter Bubber Miley he had two things. First, Miley was a
virtuoso in his reinvention of his instrument; his vocabulary of
slurs, bitten, choked notes and bent tones was passed on to other
members of the orchestra, and from it came the shouting, vocal
aspect of the band. And Miley was an extraordinary composer who
produced the raw elements of both ``East St. Louis Toodle-oo'' and
``Black and Tan Fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   In those works one hears a striking balance between form and the
power of Miley's cornet playing; Ellington's orchestral brilliance
begins to show. Ellington was gaining fame by the time he took the
Cotton Club job. Two years later, in 1929, he was featured in the
film ``Black and Tan.'' Ellington is presented as a serious
composer; his name is ``Duke'' in the film.
</P>
<P>
   The film showed both that Ellington was famous, and what he was
famous for. It also made clear that even at that time, a black,
serious composer could, by force of will, ability and the right
friends, present himself with dignity. And it showed the
development of Duke Ellington, the icon. Tall and handsome, and
affecting an almost English diction, he was perfecting the image of
the reserved, witty and intelligent serious composer.
</P>
<P>
   It was an image that lasted until his death in 1974, and it was
an image that affected people in and out of entertainment; its
democratic reach provided a meeting ground for people of all races.
B.B. King, as a child in Mississippi, was so moved by the image
that he modeled his stage demeanor after Ellington's.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was a master of the three-minute form imposed by the
limits of the 78, Ellington continued writing extended pieces in
the 30s, including ``Creole Rhapsody,'' ``Diminuendo and Crescendo
in Blue'' and ``Reminiscing in Tempo.''
</P>
<P>
   Such compositions challenged the lines between popular
entertainment and art music. Often enough the compositions were
tied to what he called ``the character and mood and feeling of my
people,'' and they culminated in the 1943 performance of his
masterpiece ``Black, Brown and Beige,'' a three-part work based on
the black experience in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As with his previous longer pieces, ``Black, Brown and Beige''
sought a third way, a path between popular culture and art culture.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ellington reaches ``Black, Brown and Beige,'' he has
written mood pieces and big-band pieces. He has revitalized blues _
``Ko-Ko'' _ and by 1940 he had written seven pieces about the black
condition using ``Harlem'' in the title.
</P>
<P>
   Ellington was the master of modernism, and where as a young
composer he had sipped the wine of the culture around him, ``Black,
Brown and Beige'' shows that he dominated it. He, like the other
great figures of American modernism, be they Buster Keaton or
Ernest Hemingway, had found a way to be both popular and
intelligent, to mesh the needs of the audience with those of the
artist.
</P>
<P>
   No other country in the Americas was blessed with a popular
culture so rich and lasting, and Ellington, by the time he was 40,
had set the paradigm for the most productive path of all, the third
way.

ELLINGTON CENTENNIAL: RECALLING SHIFT IN POPULAR TASTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 17) 
Mark Tucker, a professor of music and American Studies at the
College of William &AMP; Mary, is the editor of ``The Duke Ellington
Reader.'' 
(bl) 
By MARK TUCKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Most musicians making their Carnegie Hall debut don't
open with ``The Star-Spangled Banner.'' But this was no ordinary
debut. On Jan. 23, 1943, Duke Ellington and his orchestra played to
a capacity crowd in a benefit concert for the Russian War Relief
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Ellington was riding high. At 43 he was one of the leading
exponents of swing, the exuberant style of jazz then reaching the
crest of its popularity. His music was known throughout the world.
Thousands bought his recordings, listened to his radio broadcasts,
danced to his rhythms and romanced to his songs.
</P>
<P>
   That evening at Carnegie Hall, though, Ellington chose to play
more than ``Mood Indigo,'' ``Don't Get Around Much Anymore'' and
the other hits his fans expected. He also made it clear that he
expected recognition as a serious composer. This was evident when
his orchestra gave the premiere of ``Black, Brown and Beige,'' a
work of symphonic proportions subtitled ``A Tone Parallel to the
History of the Negro in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellington turned the concert into a teach-in, portraying in his
music the struggles, hopes and achievements of African-Americans
from the time of slavery to the present. It was a bold gambit. But
the broad vision was characteristic of the man who years before had
declared ``the music of my race is something which is going to
live, something which posterity will honor in a higher sense than
merely that of the music of the ballroom today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Black, Brown and Beige'' and the concert as a whole drew mixed
reviews. In the long run, though, it didn't matter. Ellington and
his orchestra would be back, returning to Carnegie Hall on a
near-annual basis until 1948. With each concert Ellington
programmed new large-scale works side by side with shorter songs
and instrumentals, ignoring the protests of those who wished to
keep serious and popular music both separate and unequal.
</P>
<P>
   Ellington capitalized on his fame to make musical statements
that not only entertained but carried political meaning. Blurring
the boundaries of high and low art became his way of protesting
segregation and discrimination in society at large. Later, he
referred to his Carnegie Hall appearances as a series of
``social-significance thrusts.'' His piece ``New World A-Coming''
(1943), for example, projected better living conditions for
African-Americans after the war for democracy had been fought
overseas. The ``Deep South Suite'' (1946) opened with a movement
poking fun at what Ellington called ``the Dixie Chamber of Commerce
dream picture.'' Ellington even coded messages of protest into his
musical vocabulary. He once gave a race-based explanation for the
tension in his harmonies: ``Dissonance is our way of life in
America. We are something apart, yet an integral part.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ellington's role as a public figure extended beyond social
criticism. His celebrity status, regal bearing and diplomatic
locutions made him a symbolic leader for African-Americans _ an
authoritative voice for his people.
</P>
<P>
   When the nation mourned the death of President Franklin D.
Roosevelt in April 1945, Ellington's orchestra was the only dance
band selected to pay tribute to the leader in a memorial radio
broadcast. Through Duke Ellington's music, the sober announcer
intoned, the heart of the Negro weeps for Franklin Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Ellington's elevated stature, though, rested uneasily on the
shifting sands of popular taste. As the big-band era waned in the
late 1940s and early '50s, so did Ellington's authority. Now he had
to fight for his own survival, not just for the well-being of
brothers and sisters across the land. Record sales dropped and
longtime sidemen like alto saxophone star Johnny Hodges departed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ellington kept the organization rolling. By the 1950s,
though, it was clear his era had ended: from then on he was
increasingly seen as a tenacious survivor, a link to America's
musical past rather than the man of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   He still wrote longer works for the concert hall. ``Harlem,''
the most satisfying of Ellington's extended compositions, was a
brash and bluesy tribute to the urban community he loved above all
others. It had its premier in 1951 during a benefit for the NAACP
at the old Metropolitan Opera House. He explored collaborations
between jazz band and symphony orchestra in ``Night Creature''
(1955), later choreographed by Alvin Ailey.
</P>
<P>
   But he also had to confront the commercial pressures posed by
rhythm-and-blues and rock-and-roll. One way was to produce pieces
with catchy melodies, simpler harmonies and a heavier backbeat,
like ``Satin Doll'' (1953), co-written with Billy Strayhorn with
lyrics by Johnny Mercer, which became one of Ellington's biggest
hits.
</P>
<P>
   Other attempts to keep up with current trends were less
successful. Few jazz repertory orchestras during this centennial
year will be performing ``Bunny Hop Mambo'' or ``Echo Tango,'' both
recorded by the Ellington orchestra for Capitol in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1950s, as Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry rocked the
younger set and television became crucial for musicians seeking
national exposure, Ellington's career languished and his creative
energies flagged. For six weeks in the summer of 1955 his
internationally renowned orchestra performed in an aquatics show in
Flushing, Queens, sharing the bill with skaters, divers and dancing
fountains. Was this the rosy future Ellington had envisioned in
``New World A-Coming'' back in 1943?
</P>
<P>
   Not really. Soon Johnny Hodges and his silken alto returned to
the Ellington reed section. And the following summer, in Newport,
R.I., Ellington got lucky, according to his own definition: being
at the right place at the right time, and doing the right thing
before the right people.

`THE THIN RED LINE': ABOVE THE BATTLE, MUSING ON THE PROFUNDITIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 17)  
 Phillip Lopate is the author, most recently, of ``Totally,
Tenderly, Tragically,'' a collection of film criticism and essays. 
(bl) 
By PHILLIP LOPATE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Thin Red Line'' is a very odd movie. I think it one of the
pinnacles of American filmmaking in the 1990s, but I can also
appreciate the objections leveled against it by other film critics
who were baffled, irritated or chagrined by this three-hour
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the film had been so long-awaited (10 years in
the making, by Terrence Malick, a maverick legendary for both the
sparseness and self-consciousness of his output), that it could not
help disappointing such hyped expectations.
</P>
<P>
   For another, what is actually on the screen is so singular, so
peculiar, that there may not be many previous models by which to
judge it.
</P>
<P>
   After all, here is a major-studio Christmas release that begins
with a crocodile submerging itself in algaed water while an
unidentified voice-over muses about the origins of evil, the
breakup of community, the mystery of love, the proper way to meet
death, the existence or nonexistence of a higher plane of being.
These philosophical questions persist, breaking in sometimes at
moments of high drama, distancing us from the narrative or at least
impelling us to search for a larger meaning to it. Sometimes the
voice-over belongs clearly to one of the characters; at other
times, we are left to guess. The result is that all the voice-overs
seem to come from a universal mind; darting from self to self,
connected by invisible tendrils of fear and hunger for
understanding. The voices are obviously also fragments of the
director's own thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   I think what we have here is a strange hybrid: a picture that
seems to be a blood-and-guts war movie (and Malick shows surprising
gifts as an action director), but that asserts at the same time an
entirely other, centrifugal movement, akin to what might be called
``meditative cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, we can think of films like Mizoguchi's ``Sansho
the Bailiff,'' Renoir's ``River,'' Tarkovsky's ``Stalker,''
Sokurov's ``Mother and Son,'' Bresson's ``Man Escaped'' or John
Ford's ``She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.'' Each of these films seems to
put us in touch with eternal rhythms and spiritual questions
underneath their melodramas of survival. In meditative cinema, time
is often played with, distended, backed up. As viewers, we move
both forward and in circles.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, one of the climaxes of ``The Thin Red Line,'' you
would think, is when the C company troops break through and swarm
over the Japanese soldiers, taking them prisoner. In a more
straightforward war picture, such a victory would certainly have
been celebrated. Malick undercuts the triumph of the moment by
providing elegiac music as a counterpoint to the fast-moving
visuals, by dissolving dialogue into voice-over, and by filming the
Japanese in a stylized manner, naked, praying, as though caught in
the midst of a complex grief ritual.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no point in comparing ``The Thin Red Line'' with
the year's other formidable war movie, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' we
can note at least that Hans Zimmer's haunting, unresolved musical
score in the Malick picture is the polar opposite of the brashly
gung-ho score by John Williams for Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thin Red Line'' has been criticized for its sketchy
historical context. But I don't think Malick's intent was to stage
a realistic recreation of World War II such that every veteran
would approve: the uniforms and weaponry are accurate, and that's
as far as it goes. It is a war movie in the same mythopoetic sense
that Sergio Leone's 1968 ``Once Upon a Time in the West'' is a
western. It comes late in the tradition, when it can only question,
doubt and celebrate a lost genre.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, ultimately, it is less about the war than it is about
living in one's head _ that primary theme of Malick's two earlier
movies.
</P>
<P>
   It may well be that his initial impulse was to use the James
Jones novel, ``The Thin Red Line,'' as a springboard to get him
beyond the sociopath-solipsist ironies of ``Badlands'' (1973) or
the arch, hothouse insularities of ``Days of Heaven'' (1978) and to
move him toward the materiality of troops and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Malick's second draft screenplay, dated 1996, is a
fairly straightforward telling of a war story, without any
voice-overs. But having summoned the cast and crew of hundreds and
shot the endless footage, he was forced to consider what it all
meant: what was the reality behind the reality? Certain pockets of
surreal unreality, already in place (images of GIs fighting
bewilderingly in a fog, or enemy troops covered with vines) became
accentuated. Several characters and subplots got trimmed: we know
that Bill Pullman ended up on the cutting room floor, while Adrien
Brody, once the film's Everyman, got reduced to a near-mute
onlooker.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliantly acted conflict between Nick Nolte's harsh
Lieutenant Colonel Tall and Elias Koteas' ``soft-hearted'' Captain
Staros became even more dramatically pivotal. And a relative
unknown, Jim Caviezel, was built up to the central protagonist,
Witt, the film's sweetly thoughtful Prince Myshkin character, who
keeps looking for a lost spiritual harmony while easing his mates
in their dying moments.
</P>
<P>
   Witt tangles with his opposite number, the cynical, rock-hard
Sergeant Welsh (Sean Penn), who ridicules the other man's idealism
and hope: ``You're just running into a burning house where no one
can be saved,'' says Welsh. There's a wonderful scene between the
two of them, after the first battle has ended, when Witt comes
across the sergeant drinking alone in an abandoned house. (It is
staged in a restlessly subtle manner, the camera tracking around
both men). Welsh sneeringly asks Witt if he's still seeing ``the
beautiful light.'' Witt tells the other man sympathetically, ``I
still see a spark in you,'' as the camera advances toward Welsh,
who seems (to us) covered in shadows.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Light is the reigning literary metaphor and visual principle in
the film. John Toll's extraordinary cinematography parcels it out:
a typical shot will be three-fourths shaded, with shafts of light
sculpting the crucial forms. The men's heads are dark holes: their
foreheads truncated by helmets, their faces smeared with blackening
sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the film seems to have been shot at twilight, the
``golden hour,'' when there is just enough sun left to transform
the muted image poetically. But in one stunning midday sequence,
the light plays an especially symbolic part: an officer waves two
advance men forward, and they are instantly shot down (the first
combat casualties). The man who sent them forward looks devastated;
then we see the field where they lie, as the sun sweeps across it,
pushing away a cloud, seeming to mark the boundary between life and
death. Malick is fond of these ``correspondences'' (to use
Steiglitz's term for his cloud studies) between the sky above and
the mental mood below. ``Guilt crosses over him like a
mustard-colored cloud,'' Malick writes in ``The Thin Red Line''
screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of excruciating battle tension, a soldier will
suddenly become mesmerized by a leaf pattern, or high grass waving
in the wind. We are treated continually to these layerings of
consciousness: past and present, exterior and interior, as when the
character played by Ben Chaplin crawls along on a dangerous solo
mission, thinking of his wife in her print dress.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have complained that the characters in the film
aren't fleshed out. This is true, if what is meant is specific
sociological and psychological detail. Each soldier tends to be
characterized by a particular philosophical belief or fixed idea:
one thinks the war is motivated by property, another that all men
are part of a single soul, another that romantic love carries
ultimate meaning, another that we are merely dirt and grass.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Malick is anti-psychological (his next project, ``The
English-Speaker,'' is based on the case of Anna O., from Breuer and
Freud's ``Studies in Hysteria.'') It is that here he is interested
in the metaphysical, from which standpoint individuality becomes
less important; he is certainly interested as well in a soldier's
interiority, but as parts of an unseen reality or collective mind
rather than as imprimaturs of idiosyncrasy.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the two antagonists, played by Nolte and Koteas, both have
tender paternal feelings toward their men, thinking of them as
their ``sons.'' The film plays extensively with the notion of the
Army as family, both questioning and affirming it. What is
stressed, finally, is the commonality of human connection and
spiritual incompleteness.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Caviezel's character, Witt, feels he has come in contact
with another, better world (illustrated by the ``paradise gained''
sequence in which he plays with the Melanesians), so the movie
keeps groping for an unseen, transcendent reality. This is always a
chancy thing to do in the medium of film, which is so relentlessly
materialist: but it is finally the longing for that greater glory,
rather than any convincing delivery of it, which ``The Thin Red
Line'' embodies.
</P>
<P>
   The voice-over meditations that Malick superimposes on his
story, and that seem drawn from such disparate sources as American
Transcendentalism, Christianity, Whitman's ``Calamus'' poems and
Eastern religions, have irked some viewers, who regard them as
sophomoric dormitory blather. I see their point, but it depends on
whether you regard questions about the origins of evil and the
purpose of life as philosophically legitimate, or intrinsically
naive.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to remember that another large, ambitious war
movie, ``Apocalypse Now'' (1979), sought coherence at the last
moment by adding an overview narrative written by Michael Herr. The
difference is that the ``Apocalypse Now'' narrative line was
genuinely chaotic, and even the ending remained in question almost
until the moment of release, a problem that no voice-over could
hope to correct. Malick's narrative line was more delineated
throughout, but when he put it together he obviously felt it needed
another level of consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   One source he seems to have consulted is his own play, ``Sansho
the Bailiff,'' a loose adaptation of the Mizoguchi film. Malick
wrote it in 1993 while he was preparing ``The Thin Red Line.''
There is a long middle section in the play in which the hero
stumbles upon a land of spirits and demons. There, he meets a
character called the Mind, who is hungry for he knows not what.
``His appetite grows with each disappointment,'' Malick writes.
``And yet he feels he is free, that he can leap around endlessly,
go wherever he pleases.''
</P>
<P>
   This seems to be the prototype of the mind leaping from
character to character in ``The Thin Red Line.'' The hero, thinking
of his family, cries out: ``I would be ashamed for them to know
what I've come to _ what a ruin! _ how all their sacrifice, their
care, is poured out like water in the sand!'' Now note the
voice-over Malick gives to Nolte's Lieutenant Colonel Tall: ``My
family, my home. All they sacrificed for me, poured out like water
on the ground. All I might have given for love's sake. Too late!
Dying, slow as a tree.'' While Tall is looking snappy, alert,
unfazed, the career soldier personified, he knows he is dying
inside. Without this voice-over, we would regard his actions later
as merely those of a military bully. This way, we see him as part
of the fever-dream that is ``The Thin Red Line,'' part of that
larger, questing, self-tormented consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Charles Ives' ``Unanswered Question'' is quoted on
the music track; by its title alone, there could not be a better
reference for this movie, which invokes so many unanswered
questions and dares (in every way but visually) to be uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   We may still feel there is something not quite settled or
perfected in this ``Thin Red Line.'' Perhaps it tries to say too
much after having hacked away too much, or it feels, disquietingly,
both maximalist and minimalist.
</P>
<P>
   We may never stop wondering about other possibilities that may
have been carved from the footage, the alternate universes of ``The
Thin Red Line,'' the six-hour ``Iliad'' version, the one with Bill
Pullman and a speaking Adrien Brody, the one with no voice-overs,
and so on. But this is the one we have, and it is fascinating both
for its longing and achievement.

 (af)  
 By VINCENT CANBY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The cover of the program for ``Far East,'' A.R.
Gurney's dark comedy now at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at
Lincoln Center in Manhattan, promises something on the order of
``Madama Butterfly'': a United States Navy officer in his dress
whites stands against what looks to be an antique Japanese print of
a geisha.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, no, you think, not that story again, and not even a Puccini
score to go with it. Well, ``Far East'' is that story again, but
with a few important twists. Here is a ``Madama Butterfly'' in
which the lovesick geisha is a Japanese waitress whom you never
meet, the score is a collection of American standards from the
1950s, the cornier the better (``Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing,''
among others), and the Pinkerton character is a young man ready to
make a long-term commitment.
</P>
<P>
   As you might guess, ``Far East'' is not a tragic romance. It is
a sometimes sharply satiric consideration of Gurney's favorite
subject: the WASP, both as a mindless American predator and as a
victim of the value system that has shaped him, for better and
mostly for worse. ``Far East'' is also his most entertaining comedy
since ``Sylvia,'' the one about a man who falls in love with a dog,
which, when the dog was played by Sarah Jessica Parker in the
Manhattan Theater Club production, seemed a perfectly reasonable
thing to do. Gurney is a playwright who goes his own way.
</P>
<P>
   WASP writers, including the man who wrote ``Sylvia,'' ``The
Perfect Party'' and ``The Dining Room,'' are an endangered species.
They must be made to feel wanted, even relevant.
</P>
<P>
   As American society has grown increasingly, militantly
multicultural, the WASP experience has become more and more
peripheral to the fate of the nation. John Cheever would seem to
have had some of the last, most pungent words on the subject in his
short stories, those glowing suburban nightmares about infidelity,
booze and the loss of spiritual direction.
</P>
<P>
   John Updike soldiers on with novels and stories in which the
frayed WASP identity remains proudly evident, though even he seems
to be acknowledging the possibility of obsolescence. How else to
explain his nerviest creation, the Jewish writer Bech, back again
in a third novel, ``Bech at Bay''? It is as if Updike had applied
for a passport from a foreign country in case he has to get out of
town fast.
</P>
<P>
   In the theater, Sam Shepard is our most restless and innovative
chronicler of the WASP condition, though his characters have
nothing to do with the 19th-century Eastern establishment types who
set the pace for this country's arts, industries and financial
institutions. Shepard's WASP's aren't blood kin to Old Money, like
those in the plays of both Tina Howe and Gurney. Nor do they belong
to families hanging onto their manners while selling their
silverware.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they are the bewildered heirs to the God-fearing,
sun-dried homesteaders, farmers and ranchers who moved west to
settle a new land, which too quickly became a shopping mall. They
are dispossessed, having been disconnected from all tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's people are the sort whose vocabularies are stocked
with brand names, whose sacred myths have been acquired from movies
and television.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant Junior Grade Wallace W. Watts (Michael Hayden),
nicknamed Sparky, the central figure in ``Far East,'' is another
kind of WASP entirely. The time is 1954. Sparky, an heir to his
mother's family's beer fortune back home in Milwaukee, seems to
wear his moneyed heritage with ease. In fact, he is intolerably
cocky when first met, as he reports for duty at the Yokosuka Naval
Base south of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the draft and see the world, he entered the Navy after
graduating from Princeton. He has already served aboard a ship in
the Mediterranean. His plan now is to learn all about the Orient
and, on his discharge, to finish off his education at the Harvard
Business School. He doesn't realize it at the time, but his
schedule goes out the window his first night on the base when he
encounters an exquisitely pretty, docile young Japanese woman
working in the commissary.
</P>
<P>
   Being naive as well as brashly self-assured, Sparky is soon
flouting all the Navy's rules against fraternization. When the
affair prompts threats from his commanding officer and his family
in Milwaukee, he immediately makes plans to marry. He probably
hasn't read James Michener's ``Sayonara,'' published in 1954, but
he would certainly consider it his story.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an omission that the young woman never appears in ``Far
East.'' She is less important to Sparky and to the play than what
she represents, which is his freedom from the class he so freely
ridicules.
</P>
<P>
   There are only three other characters in ``Far East'': Captain
Anderson (Bill Smitrovich), Sparky's commander, an Annapolis man;
Julia (Lisa Emery), the captain's somewhat younger wife, who is an
old friend of Sparky's family, and Ensign Bob Munger (Connor
Trinneer), Sparky's best friend on the base. The one intense
relationship the audience sees on the stage is that of Julia and
Sparky.
</P>
<P>
   With her own marriage falling apart, she becomes obsessed by her
feelings for Sparky, alternately flirting and pushing him away,
while keeping his family in Milwaukee posted on his extracurricular
activities. He has no romantic feelings for her, but she is a very
intelligent, attractive woman.
</P>
<P>
   He is someone who could easily manage an uncomplicated affair
while remaining faithful to his mistress. That's the way he thinks.
But then Julia is just the kind of WASPy woman he is escaping with
his Asian lover. An uncomplicated affair? He knows better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Far East'' is an entertaining but awkwardly developed stage
piece that at times might remind you of notes for a novel. Its
characters, Julia in particular, but also Sparky, appear to need
more room for development, introspection and comment. There is also
a subplot dealing with blackmail that is far from convincing in its
specific details: something to do with a top-secret code book.
</P>
<P>
   Gurney can't be bothered to smooth out some of the bumps in the
narrative. His dialogue, however, can be as wittily to the point as
that of any playwright at work today. At important moments, he
nails these people to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Far East'' he is not sending up his WASP characters, only
trying to understand them. The play is illuminated and made
coherent by the succession of vivid scenes between Julia and
Sparky, and Sparky and Bob Munger, which are suddenly, surprisingly
poignant and revealing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Emery gives a beautifully strong, edgy performance as the
self-destructing Julia, who is also self-aware. She kids herself
that she has no follow-through, in life as in her golf swing. That
is also true of Sparky who, as Hayden so exuberantly plays him,
could be well on his way to becoming a self-deceiving but
enthusiastic member of the corporate world.
</P>
<P>
   Smitrovich is staunch, plain and believable in the more
conventionally written role of a gruff Navy man who is more in love
with the service than with his wife. Trinneer is very good indeed
as the unhappy junior officer, caught in the subplot whose
mechanics are clumsy.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Daniel Sullivan, has given Gurney's detailed text
the fine, fluid, firm production it demands. The play is presented
as if it were under the influence of some exotic amalgam of Japan's
Kabuki, No and Bunraku (puppet) theaters.
</P>
<P>
   In the austere set designed by Thomas Lynch, the stage floor is
a piece of minimal art: a white wooden field with a rectangle of
royal blue at the center; on the back wall there are Japanese
printlike projections. The stage remains bare except for the
appearance of wooden stools to sit on from time to time and the
occasional props. These are silently whisked on and off by the two
stagehands, dressed in black with veils obscuring their faces, like
handlers of the nearly life-size Bunraku puppets.
</P>
<P>
   An actress identified as The Reader (Sonnie Brown) sits on a
raised platform at the right of the stage, speaking the lines of
the various unseen incidental characters. As the action progresses,
she signals scene changes by bringing together two wooden blocks to
create a delicate clicking sound. This may be Japanese theater as
remembered in a tourist's saki dream, but it is as evocative as it
is soothing.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the elegantly civilized setting in which to show off
the grossly conflicted psyches of Sparky and Julia, even as they
learn to cha-cha-cha at the Yokosuka Officers' Club. &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS &QC;  &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Time was when every celebrated actress of her generation played
Jean Racine's ``Phedre,'' considered the glory of French classical
theater. Among those celebrated: Duse, Sarah Bernhardt, Edwige
Feuillere. It says something about our generation, and about the
availability of French classical theater in New York, that, until
10 days ago, the only celebrated actress I had ever seen in the
role was an actor: Everett Quinton.
</P>
<P>
   Now I've also seen Diana Rigg, who appears in the last of her 10
performances in the part Sunday at 3 p.m. at the Majestic Theater,
presented by the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
</P>
<P>
   This ends the Almeida Theater Company of London's 13-day visit,
during which Ms. Rigg, her co-star Toby Stephens and their
colleagues have been playing both ``Phedre'' (1677) and Racine's
``Britannicus'' (1669). Though adored in France, Racine is seldom
seen in the English-speaking theater, largely because the French
verse is so difficult to translate into English.
</P>
<P>
   For this production of ``Phedre,'' Ted Hughes, the English poet
laureate who died recently, composed a new adaptation, not in the
rhymed alexandrines of the original but in free verse. There is
also a new adaptation of ``Britannicus'' by Robert David MacDonald,
this one in English rhymed couplets, which manages to evoke some
measure of the severe formality of the original.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, Hughes' ``Phedre,'' which reads beautifully, plays as
if it were five hours long instead of the actual 1 hour and 45
minutes. On the other hand, MacDonald's ``Britannicus'' plays like
a breathless melodrama written yesterday, though it is nearly
impossible to read. When you see the words on the page, you can be
astonished by the Tin Pan Alley rhymes, and defeated by the
meaningless extra words stuffed into the lines to satisfy the
demands of the meter. You don't hear them in performance.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect, however, that the difficulty with ``Phedre'' may be
more with the production itself than with the Hughes adaptation. As
directed by Jonathan Kent, who also directed Ms. Rigg's ``Medea,''
seen here in 1994, the actress' performance is a tour de force in
terms of strength only.
</P>
<P>
   It is hysterical, without modulation, not helped by elaborate,
what appear to be Thai silk gowns and stoles that need as much
attention to maneuver gracefully as the lines require to be heard
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ms. Rigg was both true and strong as Mother Courage in
Kent's recent Royal National Theater production of the Brecht
classic, she is not that richly accomplished in these would-be
bravura roles. She is a brilliant, subtle comedienne, as she proved
here in 1975 in the Royal National Theater production of ``The
Misanthrope.'' This is the quality that lights up her performance
in ``Britannicus,'' in which she plays the ruthlessly scheming
Agrippina, mother to the mad young Nero ( Stephens).
</P>
<P>
   Agrippina is a woman who will rule the Roman Empire or will die
in the attempt. There is something comic and theatrically bracing
about her high-handed ferocity. Phedre's incestuous love for her
stepson, Hippolytus ( Stephens), is large and all-consuming, but it
can't be communicated in what sounds like one long garrulous rant.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens, the son of Maggie Smith and Robert Stephens, obviously
has the proper theater genes. He has authority and intelligence on
the stage, without yet being able to create a singular stage
personality. He, too, isn't helped in ``Phedre'' by unbecoming
costumes, which, in his case, suggest that he needs an exercycle.
</P>
<P>
   He also fares far better in the roaring political melodrama of
``Britannicus,'' and not only because he wears more or less
contemporary business suits, which hide what they don't flatter.
Nero gives him latitude to be absolutely beastly and enjoy every
minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phedre'' could be taking place in Racine's mind. What we see
on the stage is a great, high-ceilinged, L-shaped hall that calls
up no particular time or place. Except for the self-conscious
lighting effects, it is virtually invisible, like a spasm of
emotion. The time of ``Britannicus'' would seem to be the 1950s and
the place an 18th-century royal palace in the center of London.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Bjornson designed the single set in a way that, with a few
superficial modifications, can meet the needs of each production.
Utterly sensible. So, too, are the excellent supporting
performances by Barbara Jefford, Julian Glover and David Bradley.

A MODERN MINSTREL, ONCE WRAPPED IN MYSTERY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 17) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN RUSSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just 40 years ago, rumor in the West ran hot about a Russian
pianist named Sviatoslav Richter.
</P>
<P>
   His was a curious case. Since the death of Stalin in 1953, the
permafrost had gone out of musical relations between East and West.
David Oistrakh, Emil Gilels and Mstislav Rostropovich had all been
allowed out of the Soviet Union. These were big cards, played with
panache. But when new deals were brokered, there was someone who
could not be got, and that was Richter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impossible,'' the word came back year after year. ``Richter is
not well enough to travel.'' It was said that he was too nervous to
face a foreign public, although he had played in Budapest and
Prague in 1954 with no signs of frailty.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957 Richter made friends with the Canadian pianist Glenn
Gould at a concert in Moscow. And now Bruno Monsaingeon, a Canadian
film director who collaborated on projects with Gould, has issued a
documentary, ``Richter: The Enigma,'' which will open the Lincoln
Center series ``Great Pianists of the 20th Century'' on Friday
evening at the Walter Reade Theater.
</P>
<P>
   After 1941, and not least during World War II, Richter pulled
his weight in Russian musical life. In 1959 he played at the
funeral of Olga Knipper, the widow of Anton Chekhov.
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, Khrushchev spoke to Yekaterina Furtseva, the
Soviet culture minister, and in 1960 Richter played extensively in
the United States and Canada. He performed in England and France in
1961, and in Italy in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   How it was in the United States I cannot say. But in London in
July 1961 he made an unforgettable impression. He had a mighty
head, mighty shoulders, mighty legs and mighty coattails. He had
compact but very large hands, with which he dug deep into the
keyboard for what he called ``a singing sonority.''
</P>
<P>
   In his bearing he was impassive, with just one brief, unsmiling
bow and an occasional cock of his head to the right. He was fast
onto the stage and fast off it, but when he sat down, a long
silence might follow. ``Silence also has sound,'' he would say,
``and the element of surprise is vital.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not his style to serenade, let alone seduce, the public.
Nor did he choose for his debut in London the kind of program that
would have assured him a 20- or 30-minute ovation. Many in the
audience were disconcerted to find that after a Haydn sonata, the
rest was by Prokofiev: the Second and Eighth Sonatas and 11
``Visions Fugitives.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in that audience, not knowing that Haydn's sonatas are
miracles of wit and invention, thought they were being fobbed off
with schoolroom music instead of a pianistic equivalent of the
Overture to Glinka's ``Ruslan and Ludmila.''
</P>
<P>
   But Richter, all his life, was finding new marvels in Haydn, who
was also a favorite of Prokofiev. By 1960 Richter had 27 sonatas by
Haydn and 39 pieces by Prokofiev in his repertory, so the program
made perfect sense. The credentials Richter presented that evening
were not boilerplate, but they were his own.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1961, he had played enough in the United States,
and in England, to know that he did not want to live the life of a
mainline international virtuoso.
</P>
<P>
   The music industry in its standard forms repelled him. To know
where he would have to be two or three years ahead seemed to him a
recipe for self-destruction. So did the hype, the mandatory press
calls, the standard repertory and the company of backers and
managers.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to be his own person and plot his career in his own
way. When asked about certain landmarks in the piano literature, he
would say: ``Oh, no, I shall never touch them. When I have heard
something played perfectly, I could not possibly take it up.'' This
reaction dated from his student days, when his teacher Heinrich
Neuhaus performed Beethoven's ``Emperor'' Concerto. ``After that, I
could have nothing to add,'' he said. The same thing happened when
he heard his classmate Gilels play Prokofiev's Third Sonata. ``I
loved that sonata,'' he said, ``but after Gilels I had nothing more
to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting gaps in his repertory included Beethoven's
``Waldstein'' Sonata and Fourth Concerto, and the First Concerto of
Brahms. But with other, less widely loved pieces, he took unlimited
trouble. He spent two years learning Dvorak's Piano Concerto, with
its dreaded passages for double thirds in both hands. He spent a
year on rehearsals in his own apartment for Berg's Chamber
Concerto, for piano, violin and winds, with a student orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, he wanted to lead the life of a high-level wandering
minstrel who also happened to be a great pianist. He liked to go to
places that had never heard playing like his.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, at 71, he insisted on being driven from Moscow to
Vladivostok and back, to avoid flying all the way to Japan. He was
away from July 20 to Nov. 31. On that round trip he played 91
concerts in whatever places were on the route.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, he freshened up the concert formula in the Pushkin
Museum at the end of every year. These concerts were not the kind
at which people look straight ahead and dare not eye one another.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors (by invitation only) were faced with what amounted
to a low-cost scene of faerie. On the stage, branches powdered with
imitation snow dipped from the proscenium. People dressed in
19th-century costume sat on garden chairs and bandied idle
nothings. There was a hint of a lake. Richter had in mind the scene
at George Sand's house in Nohant when Chopin stayed there.
</P>
<P>
   This tiny wonderland was to be kept free from fuss, even if the
evening's debutant was Evgeny Kissin, then in his early teens.
There was often great music, but there was no showmanship. Richter
chose all the performers, and when he put on Benjamin Britten's
comic opera ``Albert Herring,'' he himself took the production in
hand. But he did not prance around like the lord of the manor.
Dressed like an English country gentleman, with a checked jacket
and a flat cap at the ready, he moved silently from place to place,
missing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   He was never taken in. One evening he looked even broodier than
usual. ``How ghastly this is,'' he said to my wife and me. ``How
did I ever invite this pianist?''
</P>
<P>
   He also loved the smaller, handmade festivals of Western Europe.
In 1964, he went to the Aldeburgh Festival, run by Britten and
Peter Pears. Monsaingeon's video illustrates the delight with which
Richter and Britten went like the wind in the last movement of a
four-hand sonata by Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-60s, Richter was ready to establish roots in Western
Europe. The Loire Valley was his first choice, but the famous
chateaux didn't suit. Then he heard of the Grange du Meslay, a
13th-century barn the size of a small cathedral, near Tours. It was
still in use but had enormous possibilities, and Richter fell in
love with it. The Fetes Musicales de Touraine opened there in June
1964, and for years the festival was, he said, ``one of the joys of
my existence.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Fetes, Richter and his wife lived in a secluded house
on the estate of the van de Veldes, who had backed the festival
from its beginnings. Life there was a Franco-Russian paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations drifted this way and that in Chekhovian style.
Hugely gifted people drew on their sense of play, as when the
violist Yuri Bashmet rode around on a tiny bicycle. Private talks
could blaze up anywhere and at any time, as when Richter's wife,
Nina Dorleac, the incomparable Russian lieder singer, took shelter
from a rainstorm under a tree, the better to discuss the merits of
Solzhenitsyn's latest novel, ``1914.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinner was at no particular time and for no foreseeable number
of people. If Richter was there, it ran late. With good food and
good wine, collegial high humor approached wildness.
</P>
<P>
   One evening, it leaked out that we had to leave the next
morning. Richter pulled one of his more terrifying faces. ``But you
can't go,'' he said. ``We're going to play the Stravinsky Concerto
for Two Pianos tomorrow evening.'' Then he paused. ``Well, if you
really must leave, we'll play it for you now.''
</P>
<P>
   The dining room seated 8 or 10 and had two pianos, side by side.
Richter and Vasily Lobanov came over and sat with their backs to
us, just an inch or two away.
</P>
<P>
   Whether in public or private, Richter gave all he had. The
Stravinsky concerto is strenuous from beginning to end. In short
sleeves, Richter played as if he were laying his life on the line.
That huge head, that rocklike back and those formidable arms and
hands radiated an implacable power. ``That's not the whole
program,'' he said at the end; he added two sizable encores before
the evening was over.
</P>
<P>
   It was impossible to maintain, year-round, that kind of
collegiality: with Oistrakh, Bashmet, the violinist Oleg Kagan, the
cellist Natalia Gutman (whom Richter prized as ``the incarnation of
honesty in art'') and a flotilla of younger pianists.
</P>
<P>
   But before long, with the help of Yamaha, the Japanese piano
maker to which he had given exclusivity, Richter became what he had
wished to be: a minstrel with privileges. When he arrived in a new
country in Western Europe, he bought a large map and marked the
places that piqued his interest. It was agreed that he would never
have to travel on major roads.
</P>
<P>
   Within the hour, the cortege was on its way, led by a limo,
fitted out with a first-rate stereo apparatus, for Richter and his
friends. Not far behind would be the big van from Yamaha, with one
or two pianos, and a car for the technicians who kept them in
perfect shape.
</P>
<P>
   Richter scouted for a promising town _ not too big, and not
famous _ deep in the countryside of France, Germany or Italy. He
looked for a local theater, an ancient chapel or even a school that
fired his fancy. If there was a decent hotel, the cortege halted
overnight. Once the concert space was secured, local worthies were
happy to paste up the program and pass the word around.
</P>
<P>
   These were happy days. It is clear from the notes Richter kept
on his musical experiences from 1970 to 1995 that where music was
concerned, he was as sharp as ever. And in what turned out to be
his last concert (in Lubeck, Germany, on March 30, 1995) he refused
to coast, following three Haydn sonatas with Reger's colossal
Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Beethoven, for two pianos. Reger
was never one to go easy with the notes, but in the concluding
fugue of this redoubtable piece Richter and his young colleague,
Andreas Lucewicz, set up a percussive clatter of a size and quality
rarely heard in the concert hall. (And all that, be it noted, on
Richter's 80th birthday.)
</P>
<P>
   But he was not spared the wretchedness of aging. He noted its
progress, stage by stage, in the memoirs he dictated near the end
of his life to Monsaingeon.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most ``as told to'' narratives, this one is plain and
direct. Almost until the end of the 1970s, Richter played
everything from memory. He had perfect hearing and perfect pitch,
and neither had ever failed him. But then he began to have memory
lapses.
</P>
<P>
   A terrible episode occurred during the Fetes de Touraine, when
he had set himself to play eight of Liszt's ``Transcendental
Etudes.'' And in Japan he was scared almost out of his wits at the
thought of launching into Beethoven's Opus 106. After that, he
decided that he would never again play without the score in front
of him.
</P>
<P>
   This gave him a new security, but it did not give him back the
power of hearing correctly. More and more, he would play in one key
and hear the results in another. Trebles he would hear higher, and
basses lower, than they actually were. Not only was this unnerving
in itself but it made him doubt his fingering.
</P>
<P>
   In his 81st year, he fell and broke a knee. He had always been a
tremendous walker, eagerly covering 25 or 30 miles a day. His legs,
like his hands, never tired. To be a cripple was a mortal blow to
him, relieved only by the fact that he could take part in the film
Monsaingeon was preparing. Though a wraith of his former self, he
was clear and steadfast before the camera.
</P>
<P>
   As well he might have been, for he had fulfilled his life's
dream in those impromptu, out-of-the-way concerts. An eager,
unsnobbish public filled every seat and went home wreathed in
smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd do it for nothing,'' Richter said, ``but I'd never hear
the end of it from the concert managers.''

A RAREFIED BELGIAN WHO SPECIALIZED IN MOURNFUL BEAUTY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 17) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Photography festivals have flourished like weeds ever since
Jean-Luc Monterosso _ now the director of the Maison Europenne de
la Photographie _ organized the first biennial Mois de la Photo in
Paris in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Many festivals were founded in the intervening years; now
photographs stream en masse to international gatherings in Arles,
Barcelona, Berlin, Caracas, Houston, London, Montreal, Moscow, Sao
Paulo and Stockholm; to cities in Australia, Bulgaria, Korea, Mali,
Mexico (which puts up 700 exhibitions around the country, including
one in Texas), Portugal and more. Slovakia has two festivals, one
of them annual. The Netherlands has three.
</P>
<P>
   A well-organized festival is likely to harbor discoveries, good
shows and the inescapable quota of bad ones. (The Lord arranged an
abundant supply of talent but neglected to insure that it be
properly parceled out. Not everyone in line at the distribution
center is given a fair share.) The Mois de la Photo this year seems
to have had all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   One of the discoveries was a Belgian pictorialist named Gustave
Marissiaux, who was widely shown in Belgium, Paris, Berlin and
Italy in the first decade or so of this century, then largely
forgotten even in his own country until a 1997 retrospective at the
Musee de la Photographie in Charleroi.
</P>
<P>
   A show during the Mois at the Wallonie-Bruxelles Center in Paris
closed on Nov. 26, but a beautifully illustrated and
well-researched catalog, ``Gustave Marissiaux: La Possibilite de
l'Art,'' by Marc-Emmanuel Melon, has been published by the
Charleroi museum.
</P>
<P>
   It is not altogether surprising to chance upon an unknown
pictorialist, even a good one, wielding (as most of them did) a
soft-focus lens and painterly printing techniques to fashion ideal
scenes of domestic tranquillity, Edenic nature or feminine beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Pictorialists seem to have sprouted like mushrooms in the damp
aftermath of the Symbolist movement in painting late in the last
century when gentlemen and gentlewomen were cultivating their
aspirations to art. Marissiaux had a good claim to art and a couple
of surprises in his repertory as well.
</P>
<P>
   Born in France in 1872, naturalized as a Belgian in 1893,
Marissiaux took up photography in 1894. His pictures may be less
meltingly beautiful than Heinrich Kuehn's, say, less innovative and
modern than Alvin Langdon Coburn's, but beautiful nonetheless, and
sometimes arresting.
</P>
<P>
   There are women poised expectantly by open doorways, or reading
or gazing out the window, always alone, indoors, searching for
fulfillment, perhaps merely for stimulation, from someone or some
place else. There are portraits of women even more alone, sunk into
their inner lives with downcast eyes. And pictures of Venice, that
isolated city, preternaturally empty, suspended in reverie, waiting
to be awakened.
</P>
<P>
   There are also landscapes with wistful trees and bony branches,
dream-struck gardens, marshes at dusk, where reeds grow tangled in
eternally still water _ places where mists linger and fog catches
in the foliage. Marissiaux raised melancholia to a delicate pitch
of perfection, as if he were exquisitely resigned to what Thomas
Hardy in 1891 called ``the chronic melancholy which is taking hold
of the civilized races with the decline of belief in a beneficent
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the surprises. One is his use by 1914 of a
virtually unknown color process that was never commercialized
because it was so difficult, devised by a Belgian photographer
named Joseph Sury, who asked Marissiaux to experiment secretly with
his discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Marissiaux had already shown autochromes, the first successful
color process on the market, which many pictorialists tried out.
Autochromes are not very stable; they are usually shown behind a
curtain or lighted for only a moment, because light bleaches them
out. A couple of Marissiaux's autochrome landscapes in the Paris
show were peculiarly pink, no doubt a sign of fading.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sury process was so stable that his pictures were hung
on the wall last year beside his platinum and gum prints without
special protection. This is astonishing for the second decade of
this century, and better still, Marissiaux's color sense was
delectable. His nudes stand against pinky-beige walls, as if the
entire picture were a reflection of flesh. A woman in a
pistachio-green gown is ensconced in an olive-green setting;
another in palest blue and dull orange is poised before a muted
aqua ground.
</P>
<P>
   The other big surprise is that Marissiaux created a form of
photographic spectacle, which Melon calls ``a sort of opera for
fixed images.'' Here slides projected on enormous screens (about 23
by 19 feet) were accompanied by an orchestra, a choir and soloists
performing contemporary music, followed by a poetry recitation.
</P>
<P>
   A partial tradition for such spectacles already existed in
Belgium. Once a year, beginning in 1888, the photographic society
put on a show of slides of individual pictures by its members,
alternating with short musical pieces by local composers, as a
benefit performance for local charities in Liege. The city's elite
attended these; who else turns out for benefit performances?
</P>
<P>
   In 1903, Marissiaux gave the occasion a theme _ Venice _ and
showed only his own and one other man's pictures. The evening now
had unity and probably some sense of progression, a kind of
narrative manque.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog implies that Marissiaux may have heightened the
drama of music and poetry that had long accompanied the various
photographers' slides. The next time Marissiaux put on this show it
had his pictures alone; it was performed 26 times until 1924, in
Liege, Brussels, Antwerp and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There was one moment in Marissiaux's career when his photography
changed direction under an external impulse: in 1904 he was
commissioned to make a series of pictures of mines. The series,
called ``La Houillere,'' was the only nod he made to a life beyond
an etiolated dream of paradise. Even these pictures are still and
faintly dreamlike, with the workers removed to the middle ground or
the rear and no one suffering or sweating.
</P>
<P>
   The series was shown as planned at the Universal Exposition in
Liege in 1905; then Marissiaux made this too into a performance.
For several years he showed ``Venice'' and ``La Houillere'' on the
same program in Belgium and Paris, with the same orchestra, to what
appears to have been the same audiences. It was a great success.
</P>
<P>
   In 1911, Edward S. Curtis produced a ``picture musicale,'' which
used slides, fragments of film and a score based on American Indian
songs, but after an initial success it quickly sank from view.
Perhaps the closest thing to Marissiaux's kind of spectacle is Nan
Goldin's slide-and-music shows, where the content is obviously a
bit different.
</P>
<P>
   In Marissiaux's day spectators had long been hungry for
magic-lantern and slide shows as entertainment and education, but
the first two decades of the century also witnessed the rise of
cinema. Movies, however, were low-class fare, shown in industrial
areas, in music halls, at fairs; Melon says that pictorialists
looked down on them as representing the cult of illusion that
pandered to a mass-audience taste.
</P>
<P>
   In America, cinema may have become acceptable for the upper
classes a few years before it did in Belgium; at all events, by
1924 Marissiaux's spectacle gave way to the new era.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog makes a very strong case _ occasionally slightly too
strong _ for pictorialism as a symptom of bourgeois reaction
against the disturbing rupture of the social fabric by the rise of
worker unrest. Belgium had bloodily suppressed worker outbreaks in
the 1880s and had finally instituted universal suffrage, after a
manner of speaking, allotting extra votes to people with money and
education, which insured that they could keep the workers at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Pictorialism depicted an idyllic, peaceful existence for the
bourgeois audience that went to museums and exhibitions and,
according to Melon, the educated bourgeoisie that attended
Marissiaux's spectacles found in them reinforcement of their
separate social identity.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the politics were not quite so clear-cut in this
country, American pictorialists were certainly striving to become
an elite, to be valued as artists and individuals rather than
craftsmen or cogs in the industrial machine. Alfred Stieglitz, who
believed true artists should live rarefied lives devoted to art,
essentially ignored Lewis Hine's tough pictures of child labor.
Pictorialism owed a debt to the Symbolists, many of whom, from
Baudelaire on, had expressed disdain for the masses and their
inferior taste.
</P>
<P>
   It was Symbolist, too, to cherish melancholy. Marissiaux himself
is said to have been reclusive, melancholic, probably
hypochondriacal; his images expressed his personality, his
personality the time. There are historical moments that favor
certain kinds of character and presentation; Ronald Reagan wouldn't
have stood a chance in the years following the American Revolution,
nor would Calvin Coolidge today.
</P>
<P>
   In Marissiaux's day Belgian poets sang of dying flowers,
vaporous apparitions and veils of pale thought, to all of which he
tried to give concrete representation. His times embraced him,
offering him the opportunity to make a virtue of his own weaknesses
and fears, to fixate on mournful beauty and deliver it to those who
yearned for nothing more.

<P>
   At supper in his studio in St. Petersburg or at lunch in a New
York restaurant, Boris Eifman, 52, is all good-humored gallantry.
It isn't until this Russian choreographer reveals his life story
that one understands how a surface calm harbors the emotional
intensity that blazes through his ballets.
</P>
<P>
   Not every choreographer has been housed in an underground pit
during a harsh early childhood in Siberia or had all his father's
relatives killed by the Germans during World War II. Nor have most
choreographers, at least in the West, had to invent themselves
within the closed society of the Soviet era. And rare is the
choreographer who, like Eifman, has never been a professional
dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a passion for creating dances has consumed Eifman since he
was 13, and passionate dancing is synonymous with the Eifman Ballet
of St. Petersburg, which opens a two-week season Tuesday night at
City Center. The repertory will again include ``Tchaikovsky'' and
``Red Giselle,'' the highly theatrical psychodramas that became the
hot tickets in the company's New York debut last April.
</P>
<P>
   There are also United States premieres: ``The Karamazovs,'' set
mostly to Rachmaninoff's music, and plotless works on a double
bill, ``Requiem,'' set to Mozart, and ``My Jerusalem,'' which
includes a rock score.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one could be bored by the brilliantly expressive
choreography of Eifman, his scenarios struck some last spring as
provocative rather than persuasive. But he emphasized in an
interview that all his ballets reflect a personal point of view.
``My'' is the operative word.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Jerusalem'' is his response to seeing places of worship for
Jews, Christians and Moslems from a hill in Jerusalem. ``Because
people isolate themselves, I did not feel that people created this
juxtaposition. So God did it,'' Eifman said. ``We live in a world
of conflicts, but in the beginning, there was spiritual unity.'' If
Eifman's ideal vision reconciles these ``three paths to God'' in
``My Jerusalem,'' it is not because he wants to proselytize. ``It
is my way of seeing things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he did not set out to retell the story of ``The
Brothers Karamazov'' by Dostoyevsky but to interpret it. ``I was
seeking a new dance expression for philosophical ideas that had to
do with our time,'' he said. Dostoyevsky's discourse on freedom and
God in the novel cannot be literally rendered in ballet. But by
transforming two of the Karamazov brothers, Ivan and Aleksei, into
the Grand Inquisitor and Christ of Dostoyevsky's debate, Eifman
reached for a parable about Russia today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This dialogue is an amplification of the entire ballet,'' he
said. ``Aleksei opens the gates of a prison, but freedom results in
anarchy. At the end, Aleksei rises on a cross toward God and I see
this as the story of Russia, the religious country that became
Godless. Aleksei's hand moves up and he rises on the vertical, with
the erect spine that makes a person a person. Aleksei, in rising up
to God, becomes himself. It's my view, my reaction to
Dostoyevsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Eifman is Jewish and never changed his name, although prominent
Jewish dancers in the Soviet Union advised that it would be better
for his career. His parents did suggest, when he was 12, that dance
was not a profession for a nice Jewish boy. ``A doctor or a
musician was what they had in mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the path he took early in life, Eifman said: ``Choreography
is not a profession, although you can study and study for it. But
just as heroes in fairy tales understand the language of animals,
so choreographers have a special language to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best of today's choreographers are like the early shamans,
who were the choreographers of their time. Shamans, through
movement and energy, could communicate energy to the people. I am
interested in an art form of the spirit and of emotion that comes
through movement. If it's just movement, it's not art.''
</P>
<P>
   Eifman was born on July 22, 1946, in Rubtsovsk, Siberia, where
his father, an engineer in Kharkov, Ukraine, had been ordered to
move to help the Soviet war effort in the hinterland. ``My father
had to go,'' Eifman said. ``But this move saved my parents from the
Germans in Kiev and Kharkov, where my father's entire family was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of life my parents lived under Stalin was lived by
hundreds of thousands. My father could not refuse to go to Siberia,
where he worked in a factory. We didn't live in a camp, but it was
economically efficient to house us underground. We lived in a pit
with six rooms for six to 10 families. If the government did not
build real housing, it was not because of money, but because people
were not treated like people, but like cattle.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, after Stalin died, Eifman's father was able to move to
Kishinyev, in Soviet Moldavia. Boris studied ballet and folk dance
from the age of 7 in a Young Pioneers club, as did many Soviet
children. But it was without his parents' consent that he applied
for the ballet school attached to the opera house in Kishinyev.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was accepted, and my parents said I could go only if I
continued in a music school and went to an academic school at
night. At 13, I decided I was going to be a choreographer. It
sounds pretentious, but I kept a diary, noting down what I would
put into future ballets.''
</P>
<P>
   Although virtually all choreographers have been dancers, Eifman
had performed only as a student and started choreographing for a
group he formed at 15. In 1966, he entered the newly formed
choreography department of the Leningrad Conservatory.
</P>
<P>
   Even before graduation in 1972, Eifman had opportunities to
choreograph for television, ice shows and even Kirov ballerinas
like Natalia Makarova. ``She called me a boy, so I grew a beard and
have kept it since,'' Eifman said. From 1970 to 1977, he was the
official choreographer of the Vaganova Academy, the Kirov school.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you did what you were assigned, you were looked upon with
favor,'' Eifman said. In 1979, two years after forming his company
as an adjunct of the Leningrad Philharmonic, Eifman felt he could
use Western rock music (then under attack) and express freely what
he calls contemporary male-female relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Austin, a correspondent for The New York Times in
Moscow, wrote of Eifman's success, although Austin noted that the
authorities had just clamped down on writers in the ``Metropol''
affair, an attempt to publish an anthology without government
censors.
</P>
<P>
   Eifman said that after Austin's article appeared, he was
questioned by the KGB. ``I wasn't in that dissident milieu,'' he
said. ``But they began to say I was not doing Soviet art and that I
should emigrate. I did not.''
</P>
<P>
   The paradox was that Eifman ballets continued to be both
produced and attacked by the cultural authorities. He was accused
of encouraging desertion in ``The Duel'' because it showed a
soldier's breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   His ballet treatment of Mikhail Bulgakov's ``Master and
Margarita'' shocked by depicting Jesus onstage. A ballet based on
the Song of Songs in the Bible was deemed too erotic.
</P>
<P>
   Perestroika opened up touring, and the company appeared in the
West for the first time in 1989. Eifman, who is married to a former
dancer and has a 4-year-old son, has been busier than ever, but he
has not changed his basic belief about dance: ``I have always been
drawn toward dramatic ballet, not pure dance. It comes naturally to
me. What has changed is the technique, as I have developed it. But
as you grow older, your inner emotions grow stronger; you could say
there are stronger passions in my choreography.''

BETWEEN NEWS AND MUSIC, A PLACE FOR WORDPLAY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 17) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANDY MEISLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. (italics)Is the definition of the word ``crawk'' (a) the
distaff or downward-turning crook in a guard's spear, signifying
fealty to the king; (b) the fleshy red dewlap of a male turkey's
nether lip; or (c) a sound-effects technician who specializes in
imitating animals?
</P>
<P>
   2. What cheeses are brought to mind by the phrases ``entered
naked,'' ``Ozzie's offspring should'' and ``solo in northern
Utah''?
</P>
<P>
   3. The sentence ``Are you getting tired of me talking about
this?'' is grammatically incorrect. What is the correct version and
why?
</P>
<P>
   4. Who cares?
</P>
<P>
   Answers: (1) c. (2) Camembert, ricotta and provolone. (3) ``Are
you getting tired of my talking about this?'' because a pronoun
that precedes a gerund (``talking'') is always possessive. (4)
Enough public radio listeners, apparently, to keep an unabashedly
anachronistic, nonironically hyperliterate show on the air.(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Says You!'' _ a low-budget, independently produced
half-hour quiz show reminiscent of the old-time radio series
``Information Please'' and the long-running BBC series ``My Word''
_ seems to have a good chance to join the quirky listener-supported
National Public Radio pantheon that includes ``Car Talk,'' ``This
American Life'' and ``A Prairie Home Companion.''
</P>
<P>
   Recorded over Sunday brunch in various Boston-area hotel banquet
rooms, ``Says You!'' is now broadcast on more than 60 public radio
stations nationwide (including WNYC-AM at 7 p.m. Saturdays and 5
a.m. Sundays).
</P>
<P>
   Its format is pure parlor game; those averse to puns, literary
and historical quotations, advanced Trivial Pursuit and cutthroat
Scrabble need not tune in. The heart of ``Says You!'' is the
ancient rainy-day pastime of dictionary bluffing, in which one side
concocts bogus definitions of an obscure word, presents them
alongside the correct meaning and dares the opposition to select
the right one.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of challenge occupies two rounds of the five-round
competition. The rest of the game consists of miscellaneous
literary, linguistic and grammatical questions. Categories include
``Who said what?'' ``Who or what came first?'' and ``What's the
difference?'' (Between wharf and pier, for instance, or nosegay and
bouquet.) The answers in all categories are difficult and/or
obscure.
</P>
<P>
   The quiz is moderated by its creator and producer, Richard Sher.
The two teams of fast-talking Bostonians include six permanent
panelists: Tony Kahn, host of the news program ``The World'' on
Public Radio International; Paula Lyons, a local television
consumer reporter and columnist for The Ladies' Home Journal;
Francine Achbar, a public television executive; Frances Faye Fox, a
columnist and critic; Arnie Reisman, a local television producer,
and _ a bit unexpectedly _ Barry Nolan, former host of the
syndicated tabloid television series ``Hard Copy.''
</P>
<P>
   Guest panelists appear frequently. They have included Art
Buchwald, Alan Dershowitz and the mystery author Robert B. Parker.
</P>
<P>
   The game is scored somewhat arbitrarily, with points awarded by
Sher for wit as well as accuracy. During one game a contestant
defined ``hoove'' as ``an unsuccessful Heimlich maneuver.'' In
another, ``eschatological'' was explained as ``the way they get rid
of cats in Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The author of the quotation ``There is no gain without pain''
was misidentified enthusiastically as Jane Fonda. (It was actually
Benjamin Franklin.) Sher also gets into the act: once, for
instance, he slyly introduced a panelist to the audience as ``the
brother I never had but always feared.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The show is punctuated by long, puzzled silences and pained
admissions of befuddlement; without a sharp ear and a longtime
acquaintance with the panelists, it is often impossible to tell
exactly who is speaking. During breaks in the action a four-piece
band called Pluperfect and the Past Participles plays popular music
from days long gone by.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it's the kind of eccentric and eclectic show that
judging by the rest of the programs on the air, even noncommercial
radio programmers might think twice about commissioning. Which is
why its apparent success has been greeted with perhaps an extra
fillip or two of satisfaction, brushing ever so slightly against
self-satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Says You!' is a show that people like to engage with,'' says
Murray Horwitz, a former Ringling Brothers circus clown who is
NPR's vice president for cultural programming. ``It's a show for
people who like to think _ or at least like to think they can think
a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Seymour, the general manager of KCRW-FM in Santa Monica,
Calif., says: ``It's elitist in the old-fashioned sense. It's witty
and urbane and presupposes that it's fashionable and desirable to
be highly intelligent. Nowadays, there are some who think you have
to `dumb down' shows even for public radio.''
</P>
<P>
   She adds, ``It would seem to be the last program many people
would think would be a success in Los Angeles, which is one of the
main reasons I put it on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Elitism in the off-putting sense would seem to be a significant
hazard in producing such a series, but so far very little smugness
can be detected in the banter and byplay among the contestants. The
credit for this would seem to go to Sher, 50, whose unalloyed love
of wordplay for its own sake comes through in the tone of both his
comments and those of his contestants, mostly friends and media
colleagues whom he asked to join the show when it was begun in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The president of a Boston marketing and media development
company, Sher produced local commercial programming, advertising
campaigns and industrial films for 15 years. ``A few years ago I
was about to give up show business for life,'' he says. ``I was
sick of it. I was thinking landscape architecture, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   His epiphany, he says, came one evening when he was playing
Trivial Pursuit and drew the question ``What do you call the band
of low pressure that surrounds the earth at the Equator?''
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought was: `Who cares? It's a dumb, useless
question.' Until I realized that the answer was `the doldrums.'
Then I realized: `It's not that it's important to know the answer.
It's only important to like the answer.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for starting ``Says You!'' came shortly afterward, he
says, and he fairly quickly enlisted the support of the local
public radio station, WGBH. In its first two seasons the show was
promoted mainly via word of mouth and a booth at public radio's
annual program fair; since September the show has been distributed
by NPR.
</P>
<P>
   As for the people on the other side of the dial: when queried,
Sher seems simply unable to believe that his potential audience is
limited by illiteracy, apathy or the siren songs of sitcoms,
heavy-metal or video games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see groups of students, getting together to listen and play
the game,'' he says. ``I see groups of friends, people gathering in
the same room to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the people who simply cannot pass up doing the TV Guide
crossword puzzle. They don't talk about it much. But they're out
there, believe me.''

ELLINGTON ON DISK, LIVE, LOOSENED AND OTHERWISE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 17) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, the critic Leonard Feather included the
following in his liner notes to what was then a three-LP set, ``The
Duke Ellington Carnegie Hall Concerts _ January 1943'':
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are under 30, know Ellington principally as a legend
and perhaps saw the band a few times in Duke's waning years, these
six sides will provide a startling insight ... (The set) is a trip
through the mind of a man whose achievements in the elevation of
jazz to an orchestral art form are only now, decades after the
fact, gaining some measure of acceptance in the levels where he
once was condescended to or totally ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   The world has changed since Feather wrote those slightly
defensive words. I am in my 30s and, like most people of my
generation, never saw Ellington (he died when I was 5); yet his
form of ``orchestral'' jazz has not only gained some level of
acceptance but is the heart of a powerful cultural institution at
Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   There is not an air of forced propriety about the centennial
events in 1999; Ellington is amazingly relevant, understood without
exaggeration as the obvious and only possible figure linking Wynton
Marsalis's latest long-form composition, the swing revival,
European experimental jazz and the Monday night big-band at the
Village Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   His discography will be in particularly good shape this year: in
April, RCA will issue ``The Duke Ellington Centennial Edition: The
Complete RCA Victor Recordings 1924-1973,'' a 24-CD set, and for
the rest of the year the label will slowly issue the music from
that set in triple-CD bunches. By June, Columbia will have
reintroduced spruced-up versions of six albums, including the
film-score album ``Anatomy of a Murder'' and the
Shakespeare-inspired ``Such Sweet Thunder,'' as well as a three-CD
overview. But it's still a maze, so here's a selected guide to
what's currently available: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ELLINGTON IN ESSENCE If you're looking for modest, reliable
samplers of Ellington's work, you have to be ready to answer the
Picasso question: Which Ellington?
</P>
<P>
   For Ellington's early period, the best available introduction is
``The Okeh Ellington'' (Columbia C2K 46177), a two-disk set of
recordings from 1927 to 1930. There's no way to maximize how lovely
this inventive, witty music is, with its tang and balance and
delicately shaped soloists' roles; for its time, there's also a
shocking intimacy in the recordings.
</P>
<P>
   They begin with ``East St. Louis Toodle-oo,'' run through his
residency at the Cotton Club, the most important long engagement
any jazz peformer ever had, and end with ``Rockin' in Rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   While the big labels let their Ellington stock disappear and
reappear, you can always turn to a few volumes within the
chronological series on Classics, a French label which works
through the work of jazz performers year by year. ``Duke Ellington
1929'' (Classics 569) is particularly good, including the wonderful
``The Dicty Glide,'' a cheerful stomp that somehow has eluded the
canonizers of his early work. ``1935-1936'' (Classics 659) includes
``Reminiscing in Tempo,'' a 12-minute piece with a slow gait and an
unearthly beauty, originally recorded over four 78 sides.
</P>
<P>
   Though his late-30s period offered both popular songs and
groundbreaking composition, the Ellington of the early 40s is
particularly easy to anthologize because with a great new band,
Ellington made several dozen three-minute masterpieces during a
concentrated span for RCA; they feel natural grouped together.
</P>
<P>
   One mid-size package is indispensable: ``The
Blanton-Webster-Band'' (RCA/Bluebird 5659-2-RB), a three-disk set
that contains the best of the best from 1940-1942, including ``Ko
Ko,'' ``Jack the Bear,'' ``Main Stem'' and 63 others. A cheaper
place to start is ``Sophisticated Lady'' (RCA 09026-68516-2), a
single-disk of 1940s material including ``Concerto for Cootie,''
``Chelsea Bridge,'' ``Solitude'' and other famous grade-A pieces.
</P>
<P>
   For the next decade try ``Ellington Uptown'' (Columbia CK 40836)
from 1952, when Ellington had something to prove after assembling a
new band. It takes well-known works like `` `A' Train'' and ``The
Mooch'' and turns them into multipartite kaleidoscopes; it also
includes the studio version of his ``Harlem Suite.''
</P>
<P>
   The 60s and 70s have not been anthologized into
consumer-friendly packages, but for late Ellingtonia, you can't do
much better than ``... And His Mother Called Him Bill'' (RCA
6287-2-RB), a 1967 tribute to his co-composer, Billy Strayhorn,
recorded three months after Strayhorn's death.
</P>
<P>
   The band slugs out powerful, loose-limbed versions of
Strayhorn's songs, and the recording has a slightly blaring,
demo-like feel that heightens the intensity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SMALL GROUPS AND SOLO Ellington's piano playing had a massive
sound, reach and soul, and I prefer it over the work of many others
whose reputations rest on speed and chord substitutions. There's a
small canon of records spotlighting his playing, and the best place
to start is ``Piano Reflections'' (Capitol CDP 7 92863-2), mostly a
trio album, from 1953; it's got a subdued, wintry, cheery air.
``Money Jungle'' (Blue Note/Capitol B21Y46398), by contrast, is one
of the strangest jazz records ever made, a contentious 1962 one-off
session with Charles Mingus and Max Roach; Mingus goads Duke, Duke
fights back and Roach's skittering patterns try to tie it together.
``The Pianist'' (Fantasy OJCCD-717-2), a relaxed late-period
document, offers a valuable shot of Ellington with a great
late-period rhythm section, the bassist John Lamb and the drummer
Sam Woodyard. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   LIVE AND LOOSENED DUKE Too few documents like ``Fargo, North
Dakota, Nov. 7, 1940'' (Vintage Jazz Classics VJC-1019/20-2) exist:
it's not a buttoned-up ``concert'' recording, like the Carnegie
Hall recordings from the later 40s, but a snapshot of the Ellington
band playing a few sets at a dance. The numbers are kept short, the
tempos brisk. ``Cornell University: Second Set,'' from 1948
(Musicmasters/BMG 01612-65162-2) is a more collected, measured
performance, including a cameo by the saxophonist Ben Webster.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Newport,'' the 1956 record that re-established Ellington's
popular reputation, has gone out of print. (A revamped version of
that entire performance will be issued on Columbia in April.) But
instead there is ``Live at Newport 1958'' (Columbia Legacy C2K
53584), a double-disk set of Ellington's complete festival
appearance from that year; it includes Gerry Mulligan performing a
baritone-saxophone duet with Harry Carney and Mahalia Jackson's
blissful performance of ``Come Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   SUITES Ellington thought in large quantities; he lived in the
company of a 14-man band for a good part of his life, and so his
grand themes more often dealt with ethnicities, religions and
countries than the individual spirit. On the three-disk set
``Black, Brown and Beige'' (RCA/Bluebird 6641-2-RB), made of
material recorded from 1944-46, you'll find two important suites:
the one in the title, the famous ``tone-parallel to the history of
the Negro in America'' recorded in the studio nearly two years
after it made its debut at Carnegie Hall; and the ``Perfume
Suite,'' the first suite-length collaboration of Ellington with
Billy Strayhorn.
</P>
<P>
   A far greater example of that collaboration resulted in ``The
Far East Suite _ Special Mix,'' (RCA/Bluebird 66551-2), a work that
grew out of a State Department tour to Turkey, India and the Middle
East; the music, recorded in 1966 and written with hints of Eastern
tonality, is some of the best big-band work ever made after the
big-band era.
</P>
<P>
   Those interested in a different musical idea of Ellington _ a
far cry from the indefatigable popularizer who played ``Satin
Doll'' in cities around the world _ should look to ``The
Afro-Eurasian Eclipse: A Suite in Eight Parts'' (Fantasy
OJCCD-645-2). Using sketchier tunes, most of them based mainly on
rhythm, the suite dabbles in ideas of soul and rock and African
music filtered through his own imagination. It's a radically
percussive record, unafraid to test the limits of what jazz
audiences might be ready for, and it includes a few lengthy,
stunning tenor-saxophone solos by Harold Ashby.
</P>
<P>
   Though it has its detractors I still like the 1968 ``Second
Sacred Concert'' (Fantasy PCD-24045-2) for its stirring opening and
closing passages and for its warm depths; it was music that
obsessed Ellington in his late years. For sheer versatility,
however, try ``The River'' on ``The Private Collection _ Vol. 5''
(Saja/Atlantic 7 91045-2). Written in 1970 for the American Ballet
Theater, it keeps falling outside the realm of the expected; it
begins with a piece of floating piano minimalism, runs through
serene flute-led melodies, enters a passage with vibraphones,
kettle drums and sweet-and-sour harmonies that could be mistaken
for Frank Zappa at about the same period, and then gets to
blues-based swinging.
</P>
<P>
   But ``New Orleans Suite'' (Atlantic 01580), Ellington's last
masterpiece, is an indisputable success, full of brilliant
``portraits'' of New Orleans figures like Louis Armstrong, Sidney
Bechet and the bassist Wellman Braud. The jazz that Ellington
arrived at late in life was a highly theatrical music, and it
seemed infinitely expandable, stretching continuity from juke-joint
organ music to icy, tone-clashing delicacy; this disk's profound
pleasures prove he was absolutely the most wide-ranging jazz
composer.

   Producers are not going to tell you what they really think of
George P. Lane: that they dislike him, that they believe he is too
demanding, that they dread his phone calls. That's because Lane
represents just about every hot young playwright and director in
the theater business these days, not to mention a crop of blue-chip
actors. So producers need him. They basically can't live without
him.
</P>
<P>
   Lane's clients, however, are happy to talk about him _ how loyal
he is, how passionate about the theater. And yet, though many count
themselves as friends, they describe him as difficult to fathom.
``All his clients spend a lot of time trying to figure him out,''
said the playwright Warren Leight. ``George's clients have their
own support group. He's very content to be like Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in between these extremes lies the truth about this
tall, lean 46-year-old senior vice president at the William Morris
talent and literary agency who some liken to the next Sam Cohn, the
legendary theatrical agent at ICM. In the nine years since he took
over his agency's theater department, Lane has cornered the market
on a lot of bold-face names.
</P>
<P>
   ``He represents half the people in the industry,'' said Todd
Haimes, the artistic director of both the Roundabout Theater
Company and Livent Inc. ``He's fiercely supportive and protective
of his writers and directors and will fight to the death for them.
And as much as that can be difficult from a producer's standpoint,
it probably is pleasing to many clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Even producers who take issue with Lane's approach concede he
must be doing something right. ``He drives a hard bargain, but
that's what he's there for,'' said David Richenthal, a Broadway
producer. ``Though I've heard stories from other people, my
experience has been one of great professionalism.''
</P>
<P>
   James M. Nederlander, chairman of the Nederlander theater
organization, spoke to the heart of the issue of producers versus
creators: ``They all demand too much. It's a question of
negotiating something out.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes people in the theater business _ who refused to be
quoted _ roll their eyes about Lane is, they say, his adversarial
style, his abrasive telephone manner and that he drives too hard a
bargain with small nonprofit theaters that may have trouble
affording his terms.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are producers who say they actually like him, or have
learned to like him. ``He's very abrupt _ he will say goodbye when
you're in the middle of a sentence _ he'll hang up on you,'' said
Fran Weissler, who with her husband, Barry, has produced a number
of Broadway shows, including the current ``Chicago.'' ``But over a
period of years, I have come to not only respect but like him. I
used to tremble if I had to call him. No more.''
</P>
<P>
   Well aware of Lane's reputation, his clients say they are
grateful that he fights for them. ``To be an agent in the theater
now,'' said one, the playwright Jon Robin Baitz, ``you have to
preside over a slightly dwindling Broadway and its corporatization,
at the same time encouraging playwrights to remain playwrights. It
seems to me that George is fierce on behalf of artists who might
not be able to fend for themselves in what's now an even more
mercantile and frightening world.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane fights with a shield of glacial calm. Aside from a few
pictures of his 4-year-old twin son and daughter in his meticulous
office, there is little that conveys his personality. One
paperweight, two pieces of green sea glass and two shells were the
only clues during a visit some weeks ago. Lane said he had
straightened up, and that ``it never looks like this.''
</P>
<P>
   On first meeting, he comes across as stiffly formal and opaque,
talking in clinical terms about having a ``quantitative and
qualitative commitment to theater'' and insisting rather woodenly,
``I love theater; I love my entertainment live and with content.''
And he can quickly sing the praises of his agency in phrases worthy
of a press release: ``What the Morris office has is great
leadership, and from education there is growth, and from growth
there is progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of this might be deliberate on Lane's part. Until now _
except in a Variety special issue commemorating William Morris's
100th anniversary _ he had not been the subject of an article, and
he confessed to being nervous.
</P>
<P>
   But hints of his micromanaging style are confirmed by his
exactly planned schedule. Even leisure gets penciled in. Monday
through Friday evenings: Attend theater. Saturday: Play with kids.
Saturday night: Have dinner with wife (Suna Senman, a social worker
who is now a full-time mother). Sunday: Play with kids. Sunday
night: Read plays and screenplays until 3 or 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Lane's work, his clients say happily, is his life, and he is
known for traveling great distances to see their endeavors, showing
up at every opening night. In tracking his clients over last
summer, for example, Lane traveled to Los Angeles to see Richard
Greenberg's new play, ``Hurrah at Last,'' which will be presented
by the Roundabout Theater Company in New York this spring; to
London to see Edward Albee's latest work, ``The Play About the
Baby,'' expected on Broadway in the fall, and to Poughkeepsie,
N.Y., for a workshop of John Patrick Shanley's new play,
``Cellini,'' which will get a full production sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
   He also made several trips to the Williamstown Theater Festival
in Massachusetts to see A.R. Gurney's ``Far East,'' directed by
Daniel Sullivan (a client) and now at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater
at Lincoln Center; Scott Ellis's production of ``The Rainmaker,''
scheduled to come to Broadway in the fall; Jonathan Marc Sherman's
play ``Evolution,'' and David Rabe's new work, ``Corner,'' also
directed by Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   (Lane worked out the contract for Ellis when he directed the
Roundabout Theater Company production of the musical ``She Loves
Me'' in 1993. The Roundabout, in an ironic salute to the tough
bargaining involved, put Lane's name on the marquee for several
days.)
</P>
<P>
   If he isn't at the theater or having lunch at Remi near his
Manhattan office, Lane is on the telephone, putting projects
together. He calls producers, directors, publicists and Hollywood
executives to alert them to promising scripts.
</P>
<P>
   While some of this is typical agent stuff _ he gets a standard
10 percent commission _ most important, his clients say, is the
fact that he has stuck by them in the lean years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writers go through periods where they get into terrible
trouble with themselves,'' said Baitz, who has been a client since
1985. ``And he never backs away from that _ never backs away from
the awful, infectious loneliness and free-floating failure that
just goes with the territory. When I retreat into a long, long
period of quiet work without coming up for air and I isolate
myself, it's sort of comforting to know that George Lane checks in
a lot, he doesn't forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Leight said he was amazed that Lane hadn't given up on him over
the last 14 years. ``For no reason that I can imagine, he stuck it
out,'' said Leight, whose well-received play, ``Side Man,'' has
moved to Broadway from Off Broadway. ``He was awfully patient. He
would go from an Albee opening at Lincoln Center to the basement of
the West Bank Cafe to see my stupid one act.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Some can just knock it out and some have to lock themselves in
a room and get to a fever pitch of self-loathing before they turn
in a first draft,'' Leight said. ``He understands that each
writer's process is screwed up in its own way.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Lane said, when he enters a negotiation he is
thinking less about individual contract provisions and more about a
client's long-term plans. ``My clients and I share a vision for
what's going to happen with their work beyond any one project,'' he
said. ``I'm not certain that that philosophy doesn't make some
producers uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he is a stickler about contracts for projects immediately
at hand. While, for example, producers expect a 90-day period of
exclusivity from the date a play is to close, within which they
have the option to extend a production, Lane gives them 15 days or
less. ``I think that's a generous period of time to enter into an
option for future rights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While many producers like to option a play for three years, Lane
said he granted options for three three-month periods or two
six-month periods. He is such a staunch supporter of the Dramatists
Guild that he asked to be photographed at their offices on
Broadway. The guild, he said, ``provides for authors to license
their rights, as opposed to the Writers Guild, which provides for
authors to sell their rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never lose ownership of your work,'' he added. ``Isn't that
what's in the best interest of the writer?''
</P>
<P>
   Among the performers who are clients are Alec Baldwin, Cherry
Jones, Cynthia Nixon, William Hurt, Vanessa Williams and John
Leguizamo. When Leguizamo was in San Francisco with his solo show
``Freak,'' Lane said he flew there with a squadron of William
Morris agents to figure out how to move the production to Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   When Kevin Spacey wanted to do ``The Iceman Cometh'' in London,
Lane said he helped make it happen because the Morris agency also
represents the estate of the author, Eugene O'Neill. Spacey will be
repeating his acclaimed performance when the play begins previews
in March on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a client wants in an agent,'' Lane said, ``is someone who
can understand his work, put him together with someone who can
execute his vision, and someone who can execute his deals.''
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized how his division and the others at William Morris
worked closely together, and Arnold Rifkin, the agency's president,
said this kind of coordination was essential. ``Our business has
become so vast, so technological, it's not just about sitting in
the Russian Tea Room and making a deal,'' Rifkin said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Lane's passion for the theater that Baldwin said
attracted him to William Morris: ``Other agencies I've been with _
they might not dissuade you from doing theater but they're
certainly not going to persuade you to (italics)do(end italics)
theater. They look at the theater as something that they want me to
go and get out of my system _ `Go do that' _ like it's a gambling
habit you have.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor, his clients say, does Lane try to ride their coattails to
fame. ``You always have the sense with him that the writers aren't
extensions of his ego,'' Baitz said. ``Each one of them is a little
country. He represents these countries. They're not jewels for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   George Powell Lane was born a foundling in St. Vincent's
Hospital, class of 1952. He spent the first four years of his
childhood in Brooklyn and the rest on Long Island in Garden City.
His adoptive parents died when he was a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Lane says he knew he wanted to be in entertainment from the time
he organized dances as social chairman for his fraternity at Hobart
&AMP; William Smith Colleges in Geneva, N.Y. After working for Gov.
Hugh Carey's campaign in New York, he landed at William Morris in
1976 with the classic job: mailroom clerk. Four years later, he was
an agent. His first client: Jack Hofsiss, who directed ``The
Elephant Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane still describes the first reading of a play and the first
preview as the two most exciting nights in the theater. And he says
he always ends one week looking forward to the next. ``So many
people can't sleep on Sunday nights because they're afraid to go to
work on Monday,'' he said. ``I can't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   One criticism of him is that he negotiates too hard for his
clients, at times to their own detriment. ``It's something you hear
people say,'' said Greenberg, the playwright, ``but nothing has
ever fallen through because of his tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the negotiating process is something that most would
rather have no part of. ``I can't ask for anything on my own
behalf,'' Baitz said. ``I can barely get coffee for myself without
feeling incredibly guilty about it, and I don't think I'm alone in
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to learn the point system, nor do I particularly
want to know how to handle some of the more rabid producers in the
world _ I don't want to learn that skill. I want to muddle through
a few plays and occasionally be sort of reasonably paid to try and
write a movie, and George makes that life style choice not
impossible to maintain.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the impeachment trial of President Clinton
resumes on Thursday, the House and the White House will not only be
arguing over whether the president should be removed from office.
They will be trying to shape the outcome of a critical series of
votes later this month that could decide whether the impeachment
saga ends abruptly or ventures into uncharted territory.
</P>
<P>
   For unlike a normal courtroom drama, the trial of the nation's
42nd president will not necessarily take a steady and straight path
to an uncertain verdict decided by an impartial jury. In fact, most
senators think the verdict in this case is already known _ that the
Senate will never put together the two-thirds vote, or 67 senators,
needed to remove Clinton from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   What is in doubt is how long it will take the Senate to get to
the acquittal and at what cost to the Congress and to majority
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Some answers will come in late January. Under the bipartisan
trial plan approved last week, senators face a pair of decisions
the week of Jan. 24 after the House and White House complete
opening arguments: First, whether by majority vote to make a quick
exit and simply end the proceedings, and next whether to vote to
open the door to sworn testimony from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   No one now knows how those votes will turn out. ``It is really
way too early to tell,'' said Sen. Larry E. Craig of Idaho, a
member of the Senate Republican leadership. Sen. Susan M. Collins,
R-Maine, said, ``The trial will have a dynamic of its own that
makes it unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the coalitions that are likely to form are uncertain, the
math of the Senate is clear. If the Senate trial is to end quickly,
Democrats need to hold all 45 of their own members and then draw
six of the 55 Republicans over to vote with them to dismiss the
case or to prevent witnesses from being called. A vote against
witnesses would likely clear the way for the final vote on the two
articles of impeachment, charging Clinton with perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hope that possible converts could come from the ranks
of Republican moderates such senators as Ms. Collins, Olympia J.
Snowe of Maine, John H. Chaffee of Rhode Island, and James M.
Jeffords of Vermont. Another possible pool of support is from the
Senate barons who balk at the idea of sullying their institution by
having Monica S. Lewinsky testifying in the Senate chamber about
the nature of her relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This group could include such senators as Ted Stevens of Alaska,
or Pete Domenici of New Mexico or even Trent Lott, the majority
leader from Mississippi. Stevens said on Tuesday that ``I don't
think you make up your mind until you hear the very last word that
is said.'' But he showed some impatience with the case when he
noted that he had spent the weekend looking at 8,000 pages of the
record made in the House. ``There's enormous redundancy in that
record,'' he said, ``Enormous redundancy.''
</P>
<P>
   And last week Lott said of witnesses, ``I want somebody to show
me why X, Y and Z witness might be needed, what they might testify
to, and some justification.'' He added, ``And I have to tell you I
have to be persuaded because I'm not, you know, all that excited
about the prospect.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, given that many Republicans do not want to undercut the
House Republicans, the vote on whether to just dismiss the case
after opening arguments is widely considered unlikely to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats, however, think that it could be a useful test
vote. For if it shows that there is almost majority sentiment to
end the trial and that there is no way to reach the 67 votes needed
to convict Clinton, they argue it could persuade more Republicans
to vote against hearing from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a motion to dismiss and you can't get 51 votes, the
question is how much short of that will you be?'' asked Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. ``Is it 48? 45? Is it 33? These numbers
can have a large impact on what will occur next.''
</P>
<P>
   But this could be wishful thinking. This case is not dividing
Republicans along ideological lines, and some of the moderates who
the Democrats hope will turn into allies have already staked out
positions in favor of hearing from some of the cast of characters
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some witnesses are desirable,'' Chaffee said in an interview.
``That doesn't mean an army.'' Ms. Collins has also been an avid
supporter of a limited number of witnesses to clear up conflicting
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some Republicans who are savvy about the internal
dynamics of their caucus say that if the motion to dismiss the case
fails, then it is only logical that the Senate will vote to allow
the trial to proceed with the questioning of witnesses. ``I'm very
confident that would be successful,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that the January vote only allows the House and
White House to depose witnesses in private. New majority votes are
needed to bring any of the witnesses onto the Senate floor to
testify. ``What is very hard to handicap is a vote on live
witnesses,'' McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate votes to allow witnesses to be deposed, it could
throw the chamber into an uncertain hiatus. For the deal struck
last week did not include any agreement or details on how much time
would be alloted for the questioning.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers have said they will be aggressive in any
discovery period. And Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader from
South Dakota, warns that his party will not necessarily be pushing
any longer for a quick outcome once witnesses are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously a lot of us will change our positions if the
senators chose to allow the House to bring witnesses,'' he said in
an interview. ``Then many of us would feel equally strongly about
the the White House's opportunity to bring witnesses. We want
symmetry, some balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Can Republicans risk that uncertainty? No matter where they
stand on whether Clinton should be removed from office, Senate
Republicans do have an overriding goal. They want to come out of
the impeachment process with their chamber's dignity intact so they
do not risk their majority.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday they received a warning. As they caucussed in
private to plan a legislative agenda for the year, they received
polling data about the November election from Linda A. Divall, a
Republican strategist.
</P>
<P>
   The data was a far-ranging assessment of where Republicans
should stand on issues, but it also contained the disturbing news
that voters most often mentioned the Republicans' handling of the
Lewinsky matterr as the factor that caused them the greatest
concern about continuing Republican control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   So one by one, senators emerged from the caucus, insisting that
the ongoing trial does not mean that legislative work on issues
such as Social Security, Medicare and tax relief would stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have the false assumption that while we're
dealing with the impeachment trial, that we can't also conduct the
nation's business,'' said Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the
majority whip. ``And I would say that's incorrect.''

 &UR; LIFE, THE UNIVERSE AND EVERYTHING
</P>
<P>
   BY WILLIAM R. EVERDELL
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MANY historians nowadays write with more concern for a
nonprofessional audience than they did 40 years ago, but even so
relatively few of their books unabashedly invite nonhistorians to
enjoy and profit from them. One such is a tour de force called ``A
Peace to End All Peace'' (1989), about the diplomatic origins of
the modern Middle East. The author, David Fromkin, is a professor
of international relations, a branch of political science, and like
many in political science -- including Machiavelli himself among
its long-ago founders -- he is an unapologetic practitioner of his
field's parent discipline, history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Way of the World,'' however, is quite a different project.
It began, Fromkin writes, when he was asked by a Wall Street hedge
fund manager over lunch, ``Can you tell the story of humanity in
the universe and make it whole?'' He answered that yes, he thought
he could, and began to produce this universal history in 222 pages
of text. Two hundred and twenty-two pages for everything? A
``History of the World in 300 Pages'' was written by Rene Sedillot
50 years ago, but the extra 78 pages have not made it any easier to
find today. Sir Walter Raleigh wrote ``an universall Historie'' to
while away prison time, but it went to more than one volume;
Puritans took it as an indispensable supplement to the sacred
history of the Bible, but few people consult it now. In a sense the
whole philosophy of Hegel is a universal history, as is a 50-page
reply to it, Marx and Engels's ``Communist Manifesto,'' but both
have lost their appeal. Toynbee's 10-volume ``Study of History''
has aged faster. William H. McNeill's still more recent ``Rise of
the West'' was only one volume but it was more than 1,000 pages.
Fromkin himself acknowledges only one model, the 1920 ``Outline of
History'' by H. G. Wells (and makes no mention of the book Wells
was replying to, Spengler's 1918 ``Decline of the West'').
</P>
<P>
   Fromkin distinguishes eight stages in universal history, most of
them hinging on events historians of many stripes can agree on as
the most significant in the history of humankind: the emergence of
the hominid line, apes with brains, in prehistoric Africa
(``Becoming Human''); the discovery of agriculture and the creation
of the first cities -- settlements whose residents were not all
farmers (``Inventing Civilization''); the sudden rise of
universalizing religious and moral systems all over civilized
Eurasia in the sixth century B.C. (``Developing a Conscience'');
the birth of the idea of world civilization with the empires of
ancient Eurasia (``Seeking a Lasting Peace''); the rise of
rationalism and empirical science (``Achieving Rationality''); the
irreversible encounter, after the 15th century, between human
societies in Eurasia and Africa and those in the Americas
(``Uniting the Planet''); the industrial modernization that began
in the 18th century (``Releasing Nature's Energies''); and finally
the steady movement toward democratic government centered in the
19th century and the unsteady movement toward decolonization and
world law in the 20th (``Ruling Ourselves'').
</P>
<P>
   This is of course a Western view, and it is a progressive one.
Fromkin is convinced, as against many post-moderns, that things
have got better for us humans since the Upper Paleolithic. Though
he easily imagines disasters that can interrupt or reverse the
long-term trends he describes, he sees no compelling argument for
turning back. In four concluding chapters, he attempts to
extrapolate a future, which he admits is not easy -- a little like
trying to predict global warming from one very warm November. He
expects further difficulties with population and environment; he
looks forward to the colonization of other planets, and he sees the
greatest immediate challenge as the tension between the rising need
for world law and the rising drive toward cultural
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that such a book, a universal history in short
compass, is one of the great literary challenges. Think of all
those human lives lived since Australopithecus walked in Laetoli
three and a half million years ago, or even in the five and a half
thousand since prehistory ended in ancient Sumer (or was it Egypt?)
with the invention of writing. Those billions of lives, multiplied
by their experience, are the raw stuff of history, and yet the
history of a single family could easily fill a university library.
The art is in deciding how to cut, whom to leave out and why, all
the while facing the overwhelming odds that truth will be left on
the cutting room floor. ``Telling one story necessarily means not
telling another,'' Fromkin writes, and he has a pretty good idea of
what he has bitten off. Not only are you biased to begin with
toward your own culture, its past and its valuations of other
cultures; you are biased toward your own career as a historian,
which will necessarily have been concerned with a much narrower
slice. ``Life is a story that each of us tells to his or her self;
and it therefore is a tale told by an unreliable narrator,''
Fromkin admits. And finally, since no one can know enough to write
universal history alone, you will inevitably be indebted to other
writers and researchers. How will you find the space you need to
credit them?
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the problem of presentation. It is rarely new
discoveries that demand to be recounted in a universal history, and
as Pope observed, nothing needs to be so well expressed as that
which oft was thought. With enough left out of even ordinary
histories to make history elliptical by nature, universal history
has so much ellipsis that the only way to deal with it is to use a
style as elevated and a language as allusive and referential as the
ones we use for poetry. Fromkin can be allusive, as when he
disposes of World War II in a single daring sentence: ``The war
resumed in 1939-1945 and Germany lost again.'' He can often be
lapidary, too, as in ``Today's world is the world that America
wanted, but it is not a world that America made.'' This makes it
all the more clear when he falls short, as in ``Looking back, what
happened in modern history was that a millennium ago, Europe began
to develop a distinctive mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-WAY-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: distinctive mentality.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fromkin deserves considerable credit for skirting or resisting
his guild interests. He spends only a few paragraphs rehearsing the
fruits of his own research on the modern Middle East. His use of
other historians' work is wise and acknowledged with unobtrusive
generosity, and only once or twice (for example on our knowledge of
Harappan and Mesoamerican writing) does he accept a tendentious or
obsolete source. If he is perhaps too insistently politically
incorrect, giving the Greeks too much credit for empirical
rationality, Europeans too much credit for democracy and Americans
too much for individualism, if he forgives dominant cultures more
than he should for imperialism, slavery, proletarian misery and
environmental destruction, he credits no culture for acting against
self-interest. This book might easily serve as a supplementary
textbook in secondary schools, especially with the addition of a
few pictures and time lines. Schoolchildren love to contemplate the
big picture, from both the moral and the long-term historical
points of view. There are hardly any textbooks in the prehistory
and ancient history of our planet for young people, probably
because of that silent struggle for power in local school
districts. A surprisingly large faction would be outraged if
children were taught that dinosaurs vanished from the earth some 60
million years before the first hominids walked upright on it. A
similarly large faction would be steamed if the approximate date
that cities first arose in Mesopotamia (4000 B.C.) were pre-empted
as the date of God's creation of the cosmos. The result is a
tremendous confusion about the definitions of terms and the
importance of events in what Fromkin rightly calls the unique and
therefore epic story of how we got here, and what it all means, if
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Way of the World'' is a title famously used by the risque
Restoration playwright William Congreve. Perhaps Fromkin's idea was
to avoid freighting his book with the unmediated moral seriousness
universal history has traditionally demanded. More likely it was to
prefigure his central narrative, which is that the meaning of human
history is not divine but natural, and his central moral, which is
that humans must take responsibility even for the natural and make
their own history. The responsibility becomes heavier and heavier
as our numbers become greater and greater, our cultures less and
less various and our choices fewer and fewer. History is now
universal whether we like it or not. As Fromkin writes, in one of
his most lapidary pronouncements: ``Now we're all in the same boat.
It may be a seaworthy boat; but it would be less worrisome if there
were more than one.''

 PHANTOMS IN THE BRAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind.
</P>

 &UR; GONE HAYWIRE
</P>
<P>
   BY MICHAEL E. GOLDBERG
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When Newton described the mathematics of motion he provided the
philosophers of his day with a stunning insight: that the universe
obeyed physical laws and could be understood as a great clock. A
similar revolution is underway in modern neuroscience: in the late
20th century we can begin to imagine for the first time that the
human mind can also be understood as a machine. Ultimately it
should be possible to write a physics of human consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet. But what we do know is that some human behaviors and
perceptions that seem mystical, magical or crazy arise from failure
of specific areas of the brain. In ``Phantoms of the Brain,'' Dr.
V. S. Ramachandran, a professor of neurology and psychology at the
University of California, San Diego, and Sandra Blakeslee, who
reports on science for The New York Times, describe Ramachandran's
experience with patients whose clinical problems provide insight
into the workings of the brain. Ramachandran is more than a
describer of fascinating clinical syndromes. He is attempting to
understand why brain damage can make a young man think his parents
are impostors, or a woman with a stroke laugh uncontrollably; how a
man with a stroke can be unaware that his left side is paralyzed,
or why certain types of epileptic patients have intense religious
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   The phantoms of the book's name are those sensed by amputees who
have vivid feeling, even pain, in limbs they know are gone.
Ramachandran uses those sensations to understand how the brain, and
by extension the human being, feels the sense of touch. Most of the
brain is connected not to sensors (like the skin, the ear or the
eye) that measure the world, but to other parts of the brain
representing that world. Consider your telephone. You speak, and
the telephone changes the voice's sound waves into an electrical
signal that passes through relay stations, which pass on electrical
signals, not sound waves. Ultimately, the electrical signals become
sound again in your listener's phone.
</P>
<P>
   The brain uses a network of connections in a similar way. In our
skin, the nerves that provide our sense of touch relay their
information to nerve cells, or neurons, in the spinal cord. That
information is then relayed through neural centers until it reaches
the cerebral cortex, where the body surface is mapped out in a
pattern resembling a little human (the ``homunculus''), with a
discrete area of brain representing each discrete part of the skin.
When someone kisses your cheek, neurons in the area of cortex
representing the cheek become active, and presumably other parts of
the brain interpret that neural signal as a touch on the cheek.
Drawing on the extensive literature on animal experiments in
neuroscience, Ramachandran gives a plausible solution to the puzzle
of why amputees feel phantom limbs. Years ago, in order to
understand how the brain adjusts when its connections to the world
are damaged, Dr. Edward Taub, now at the University of Alabama,
severed the sensory nerves leading from one arm in several rhesus
monkeys. The monkeys became a cause celebre in the animal rights
movement. After years of legal entanglement, they were finally
studied by Dr. Tim Pons at the National Institute of Mental Health,
who discovered a change in the cortex area that had represented
those limbs. He studied neurons that should have responded to touch
on the arm but could not because no information from the arm could
reach the brain. These neurons were not silent, though. They now
responded to a touch on the face.
</P>
<P>
   That work excited and inspired Ramachandran. He blindfolded a
patient with a phantom arm and then touched his face. The man felt
the touch both on his face and also on his phantom arm.
Ramachandran realized that when he touched the patient's face, he
excited the central representations of the arm and the face, just
as the signals from nerves in the face had excited the central
representations of both the arm and the face in the monkeys'
brains. The patient reported two simultaneous sensations: one on
the face and one on the missing limb. Although the arm was gone,
its handprint in the brain was not.
</P>
<P>
   In his final chapter, ``Do Martians See Red?'' Ramachandran goes
beyond perception and attacks the toughest problem in neuroscience:
consciousness. He sets out the problem eloquently: You and I both
know what red is, but you will never know the quality of my
experience of red. A color-blind person will never even intuit how
long-wavelength (red) light gives us that glistening matador's
cape, bloody sunset, succulent cherry thrill. The technical
philosophical term for such sensations is ``qualia,'' what a person
subjectively adds to the scientifically measurable aspects of an
object. Ramachandran posits that consciousness arises from the
perception of qualia, which, he says combines stable input (the
wavelength of red light), choice of interpretation (the cherry or
the sunset) and short-term memory (red reminds me of the sunset).
He suggests that a patient who can see only black and white would
see red if his brain were stimulated in the right place -- but
would that person see Ramachandran's red? Or my red? Ramachandran
even postulates that consciousness is the ability to process qualia
and that it lies in a specific brain area.
</P>
<P>
   Consciousness must also represent a self. Dualists carefully
distinguish between the brain that controls perception and
movement, and the self (or, more theologically, the soul) served by
those perceptions and actions. Ramachandran does not. He describes
several aspects of the self: for example, a passionate self that
colors perceptions with emotion, and a mnemonic self that has lived
and remembered your life and processes current experience in
relation to your past. Underlying this catalogue is the
breathtaking assertion that even the self is physically
comprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   Here he fails, simply because neuroscience has no clue yet how
to render the self concrete, to look at the printout of a scan or
put an electrode next to a neuron and say, ``Here it is.'' But it
is a noble failure. The book is enthralling not only for its clear,
eloquent descriptions of neurological phenomena, their relationship
to physiological mechanisms and their integration with philosophy
of mind, but also for its portrait of Ramachandran, the enthusiast
in search of the secrets of the human mind. ``Phantoms in the
Brain'' is about both the brain and V. S. Ramachandran, and he is a
splendid subject indeed.

 &UR; JERRY'S KIDS
</P>
<P>
   BY DAVID HAJDU
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MY brother was a Marine Corps staff sergeant, my mother's
favorite family activity has always been a visit to the shrine of
St. Jude, and my father is a Yankee fan -- so I've had some
exposure to cults. From reading Willa Appel's ``Cults in America''
a few years ago, I understand that mystery and contradiction
frequently pervade the personalities or the phenomena around which
cults flourish. Still, I've never entirely fathomed Deadheads.
</P>
<P>
   Why, three decades after the Grateful Dead helped create the
psychedelic San Francisco sound that seemed to capture the
blissed-out optimism of the mid-1960's counterculture, would
mushrooming hordes of fans grow ever more devoted to this
particular group of rock musicians -- as opposed to, say, NRBQ, the
Band or the Meters? Could much of the ritual obsession with the
Dead stem from a cult of personality fixed upon the band's leader,
Jerry Garcia, even if, for many of the years before his death from
drug abuse in 1995 at the age of 53, he did not display any
discernible personality? Can outsiders ever fully appreciate the
band's insular esthetic? I mean, I respect that the group would
play for three hours straight, but so would my 4-year-old son. What
does the Dead world's accumulation of quantity -- hundreds of
thousands of fans gathering year after year, collecting innumerable
cassette tapes of the same songs -- come to quantify?
</P>
<P>
   Several books published since the early 1980's, after the
Grateful Dead's following took form as a phenomenon, have dealt
with the group as pop stars and gossip fodder, touching on some
larger issues while generally emphasizing the members' embrace of
free love and expensive drugs. (Among them, Robert Greenfield's
oral-history biography of Garcia, ``Dark Star,'' and Sandy Troy's
``One More Saturday Night: Reflections With the Grateful Dead, the
Dead Family and Dead Heads'' tackle their subjects most
intelligently.) The pop-culture scholars have gone to the opposite
extreme with essentially impenetrable academic studies like Anthony
Pearson's paper ``The Grateful Dead Phenomenon: An
Ethnomethodological Approach.'' Carol Brightman, the author of
``Writing Dangerously: Mary McCarthy and Her World,'' claims the
treacherous middle ground, aiming to present a readable, serious
exploration of the band and its role as a social force, in ``Sweet
Chaos: The Grateful Dead's American Adventure.'' She seems to have
come to her subject with the same curiosity that I and presumably
others who are not tripping on LSD have about the colorful social
system that she calls the ``culture'' of the Dead.
</P>
<P>
   Originally an old-timey music group called Mother McCree's
Uptown Jug Champions, reformed as a bar band and retitled the
Warlocks, the group that became the Grateful Dead -- Garcia's
preferred name was the Mythical Ethical Icicle Tricycle -- was
never a hit recording act like the Byrds or the Jefferson Airplane
until its final years. From the start, accordingly, Deadheads (so
named for their metaphorically druggish addiction to the group),
like all fans of the less famous, have been the most dedicated. By
the 80's and early 90's, America's turn to the right further
isolated the Dead, with its Haight-Ashbury ethic -- ironically
boosting the group's nostalgia appeal and increasing the
secret-society allure of its fan base. Aging and out of sync with
the times, the Grateful Dead became a touring sensation, selling
out every concert to a worshipful audience of old hippies, their
adult children and grandchildren and young tie-dyed newcomers,
whose growing numbers seemed to be unloading from a refurbished
Magic Bus.
</P>
<P>
   As a band, the Dead was always unpredictable, a loose ensemble
of adroit musicians who reveled in interplay and improvisation.
Brightman's book is written much like a Grateful Dead set, for
better and for worse. It is episodically constructed, with
unexpected shifts in focus and tone; there are digressions, some
muddy spots and awkward moments of repetition, occasional pretense
-- then a flash of inspiration or beauty. Audiences used to talk
about waiting out the band's confused stages for the high points to
come, and readers of ``Sweet Chaos'' may find themselves doing the
same.
</P>
<P>
   The book has a patchwork quality, as if it had been written in
short segments and ordered in the end like collage. It does not
follow strict chronology, which is fine; more problematic, many
details about individuals or events appear long after they would
have been most useful. Strangest of all are Brightman's digressive
passages, some personal, which she fails adequately to relate to
the principal subjects of this book -- for example, sections on her
experiences in Cuba and in Vietnam, and with the Weathermen, the
White Panthers and other radical groups. (The Dead was firmly
apolitical and not involved in any of the radical activities
Brightman details.) Perhaps like Garcia, who came to prefer playing
bluegrass with his own bands to performing with the Dead, Brightman
secretly wanted to write a different book, one about her own
(fascinating, actually) history in radicalism.
</P>
<P>
   Musically, Brightman sometime stumbles as obviously as Bob Weir
during his apprenticeship as the Dead's rhythm guitarist. Weir's
problem, incidentally, was staying in key, not in tune, as
Brightman says. The band's bassist, Phil Lesh, composed atonal
symphonies for orchestras, not symphonies for atonal orchestras.
And Bob Dylan did not perform with the Band at the 1965 Newport
Folk Festival.
</P>
<P>
   In one of her high points, Brightman deserves some literary
bravery medal for her nearly radical account of LSD. Not quite
glorifying or demonizing the drug, she vividly evokes the
atmosphere of spiritual adventurism (however dangerous, naive or
misplaced) that led the members of the Dead, those within their
sphere of influence and so many others of their time to chemical
experimentation. Indeed, the trip is a recurring theme of ``Sweet
Chaos'': the trip on drugs -- first LSD, then for some (like
Garcia, who died of it), heroin -- that often seemed inseparable
from the Dead's expansive, mercurial music; the literal trip from
gig to gig that defined the band members' daily lives; and the
musical trip, the high of performing -- ``the pow . . . definitely
a rush,'' said Garcia, who evidently got his trips mixed up.
Brightman quotes Garcia as saying that he thought reality was an
illusion. Too bad Garcia -- and, perhaps, much of the sedated
community that indulged his meanderings -- apparently thought
illusion was reality, too.

   Four Stories I Am Finally Old Enough to Tell.

 &UR; BEYOND FICTION
</P>
<P>
   BY LAURA JAMISON
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Southern writer Ellen Douglas (the pen name of Josephine
Haxton), now 77 years old, began publishing fiction 37 years ago
under a pseudonym in order to protect the privacy of two aunts who
figured prominently in her first novel. After eight works of
fiction, including ``Apostles of Light,'' ``The Rock Cried Out''
and ``A Lifetime Burning,'' Douglas offers her first nonfiction
book, whose title, ``Truth: Four Stories I Am Finally Old Enough to
Tell,'' suggests that she at long last possesses the wisdom, and
perhaps the freedom, to cast off the veil of fiction to write as
plainly as she'd like.
</P>
<P>
   These four ``stories'' are not so much dishy revelations as they
are intrepid inquiries as to how one approximates the truth. A
writer of considerable gifts and intelligence, Douglas takes up
tales that have long obsessed her, and in some cases provided
material for her fiction -- an illicit lifelong romance, the
execution of local slaves, a family suicide -- wondering if she can
write about them factually. ``Although I call up these memories,
although they are my own, I have reservations,'' she writes. ``I
know that I put words in the mouths of people who did not speak
them. I imagine scenes at which I was not present. I know that this
is my world and no one else's -- my stories, my history. Or myth,
perhaps, one among the myths that form the lives of families and
sometimes of larger worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   The most accessible piece is ``Grant,'' in which her husband's
uncle comes to die in her house. His nurse, a luminously beautiful
black woman named Rosalie, becomes acquainted with him in ways
Douglas cannot or will not; drawn together by Bible study and
impending death, a tender friendship forms. ``There is one more
thing about Rosalie and Grant,'' she writes. ``I had thought I
could leave it out but I find that I can't.'' One day after Grant
was entirely bedridden and perhaps morphine-addled, Rosalie, in
tears, said to Douglas: ``He wants me to touch him.'' Leaving this
out would have been a kindness to Grant's memory, Douglas knows,
but not to the story.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas's other meditations are far less linear, more overtly
about the inadequacies of memory and facts. ``Julia and Nellie'' is
a labyrinthine piece about her grandmother Nellie's friend Julia
and a distant cousin Dunny, who lived ``in sin'' for most of their
lives. The more details Douglas uncovers, the more oblique their
tale becomes. ``As I gather the fragments of this story, I have a
choice: I could invent -- I am a novelist, after all.'' Then,
testing out a pleasing scenario, she balks: ``But this is fiction
-- romantic nonsense.'' Likewise, when Douglas writes about
Hampton, her grandmother's longtime chauffeur, she must
acknowledge, ``Maybe there are so many things going on in every
life that it's not possible to do more than set down what one knows
and let it go at that.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``On Second Creek,'' Douglas charts her research on a local
incident in which slaves were tortured and executed ostensibly for
plotting an uprising (they most likely never did this); the
frustrating gaps in documentation bring to mind the story of her
grandfather's suicide, which she did not discover until she was in
her 60's and of which his own wife remained ignorant until her
death. ``It is impossible to make sense out of stories that purport
to be true. Something is always missing,'' she writes. ``All these
silences, all these unfinished tales, these lacunae in the
evidence, are intolerable to me.'' And yet, Douglas marches
fearlessly through them, surely getting closer to truth than most
because she so boldly acknowledges its elusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   A sly exchange between Douglas and a friend of her father's
named Gold Smith Sr. captures the essence of this curious, lovely
book. Smith says: '' 'In your book, that other book, you turned
your grandpa into a great-great aunt. You told a whole nother story
about her and her suicide -- made it O.K. for her to kill herself.
How come you to do that?'
</P>
<P>
   '' 'You know,' I say. 'You of all people know how come me to do
that.'
</P>
<P>
   '' 'Hmmm,' he says. ' 'Twas for your convenience I reckon.'
</P>
<P>
   '' 'I reckon,' I said. 'For the convenience of the story. For
the story.' ''

 &UR; AFTER THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE
</P>
<P>
   BY ROBERT D. KAPLAN
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Turkey, a sprawling land without oil but with plenty of water
and military discipline, gives shape to the post-cold-war Middle
East. Its fluid hybrid regime -- whereby the military and a
democratically elected Parliament patrol each other -- will
probably outlast both the suffocating dictatorships of neighboring
Arab states and the paper democracies of Russia and the developing
world. Its new military alliance with Israel has affected the
strategic map of the Middle East to the same degree that the
Chinese-Soviet split affected Asia. Its economy is larger than the
economies of the oil giants Iran and Saudi Arabia. The growing
strength of both its military and its Islamists could spur the
formation of a new kind of caliphate. Yet, like a familiar old
uncle from whom one can always beg a favor, Turkey is often
overlooked by the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new generation of Turks has a wide general knowledge of
English; vivacious Turkish television shows have found audiences
throughout the Middle East. Millions of Turks now work abroad,''
Nicole Pope and Hugh Pope report in ``Turkey Unveiled: A History of
Modern Turkey.'' They also observe that ``there has been a
multiplication of speakers of Turkish languages in diplomatic
get-togethers'' since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the
emergence of several Turkic republics to the south of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Two journalists based in Istanbul, the Popes have written a
deeply revealing guide to modern Turkish culture and politics that
fills a wide gap in general knowledge. It is also a brave and at
times an ironic book. The authors show how Turkey's bad human
rights record has its antecedents in Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's
authoritarianism; how Turkish democracy played a role in
aggravating the Cyprus problem; how Kenan Evren, the stern-faced
general who led the 1980 coup, left Turkey in much better shape
than he found it, setting the stage for the economic boom of the
80's and 90's; and how the greatness of Turgut Ozal, Turkey's
leader through most of the 1980's, was in a way inseparable from
his corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The book begins a bit unsteadily, with a fast and somewhat
undigested encyclopedia-style treatment of Turkey's history until
the death throes of the Ottoman Empire. By the time the Popes reach
World War I, however, they settle down and begin enlightening the
reader on every page.
</P>
<P>
   The finest section of this book deals with the 1915 Turkish
massacres of Armenians. With an Allied fleet bombarding the
Dardanelles in the west, Turkey open to Russian attack in the east,
Christian Armenians in the Turkish Army deserting to the Russian
side while Armenians in the Caucasus were organizing anti-Turkish
militias, the ``Young Turk'' rulers began rounding up, deporting,
starving and slaughtering Armenian civilians. ``The massacres that
occurred may often seem local, but the pattern is repeated so often
as to seem organized,'' the Popes write. They have laid out a story
that both preserves the specifics of mass slaughter while also
suggesting how what happened was in a separate category from the
Nazi Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   But whereas the German authorities have formally confronted the
Holocaust, the Armenian tragedy is a ghost that the Turkish state
has yet to face up to. This is partly because of the Turkish
military's strict limitation on democracy, which results from its
deep-seated insecurity -- an insecurity that goes back to World War
I and the way the Ottoman Empire was humiliated and carved up by
the Allies.
</P>
<P>
   Ataturk was a World War I hero who forged a disciplined, modern
state out of the chaos of the Ottoman Empire's destruction. He
Westernized Turkey -- giving it a Western calendar and alphabet,
and a secular ruling class -- but he never truly democratized it.
Because the military's hierarchical, command culture stifles
civilian responsibility, the authors note, Turkish parliamentarians
have ``never really developed the concept of teamwork central to
party politics.'' That is why Turkish politics is essentially a
passionate drama of personal rivalries, often unconnected to policy
differences. Such irresponsibility both permits and forces the
generals to act as paternalistic pashas.
</P>
<P>
   The generals deal harshly with dissent. Torture and repression
in Turkey today, the Popes observe, differ little from the way
Ataturk brutally suppressed a Kurdish-Islamic revolt in the 1920's.
The pigheaded attitude toward Kurdish rights that persists in
Turkish military circles, like the failure to own up to the truth
about the Armenian massacres, rests on the belief that Western
pressure on behalf of minorities is a ruse to destabilize Turkey
(because championing minority rights was how European governments
tried to dismember the Ottoman Empire).
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's first real experiment with democracy took place in
1950, when Adnan Menderes, a wealthy landowner, was chosen Prime
Minister in an election that marked the end of virtual one-party
rule. Menderes liberalized the economy and returned some rights to
religious Turks after Ataturk's fierce secularization. But when
inflation got out of control and criticism of him mounted, Menderes
muzzled the press and interfered with the judiciary. In 1960 the
military intervened; Menderes was hanged the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's joining NATO in 1952 played a role in the tragedy. NATO
membership had brought new equipment and responsibilities to young
Turkish officers, but also allowed them to compare their life
styles with those of European and American soldiers just as Turkish
living standards were plummeting. It was these younger officers who
toppled Menderes -- a point to consider given the way East European
militaries are now being incorporated into NATO while the economies
and parliamentary institutions in those countries remain fragile.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-TURKEY-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: remain fragile.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The experiment with democracy, the Popes say, also brought
``cheap nationalist politics'' and ``distorted media coverage'' to
the situation in Cyprus, which worsened as Turkish politicians
outdid one another in their nationalism and as the military took
advantage of weak parliamentary coalitions to intimidate prime
ministers. While the military was at least willing to consider
handing back some territory to Greek Cypriots after Turkey's 1974
invasion of the island, nationalist elements in the governing
coalition at the time were not.
</P>
<P>
   The authors make the unimpeachable case that the military coup
of 1980 was both necessary and a long time coming. In fact, had
General Evren not acted, he would, by any rational standard, have
been guilty of irresponsibility. By the late 1970's, Turkish
politics was a Grand Guignol of short-lived minority coalitions,
and the country -- especially on the university campuses -- had
become a vast battle zone for armed right- and left-wing militants
and for Shiites and Sunnis. Meanwhile, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
who had just come to power in neighboring Iran, suggested publicly
that Turkey too needed an Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   When on Sept. 12, 1980, Evren and the other generals finally
took power in the ``Coup in Velvet Boots,'' as it was known --
because nobody was killed -- the country breathed a deep sigh of
relief. The number of political killings dropped dramatically, the
Popes write, ``as if a referee had blown a whistle.'' Evren used
his time in office to campaign for women's rights (he legalized
abortion) and to attack Islamic extremists, whom he called bigots.
The Popes conclude that ``the showy civilian Turgut Ozal was to
take . . . credit for building the so-called Turkish economic
miracle of the 1980's. But the fact remains that the ground was
cleared and guarded by Evren.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozal was a religious Muslim who embraced Western consumer
culture and social mobility, believing it no crime to be nouveau
riche. He was a bundle of energy who threw open the gates of
Turkey's state-controlled economy. He wanted his countrymen to be
entrepreneurs, not peasants and military officers, and if
corruption arose, that was part of the process. The result was, in
the Popes' words, a ``hell-for-leather'' economic dynamism:
shopping malls, glossy magazines and business enterprises sprang
up, and Turkish factories began to produce world-class products.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is now more prosperous and complex than ever, its Islamic
movement tempered by experience in parliamentary politics and by
the country's growing sophistication. Nevertheless, Turkish
governments remain unstable and party leaders are as irresponsible
as ever. Thus the military continues to control macropolitics. Yet,
as the Popes wisely conclude, it is the society's ``convergence
with the rest of the world'' that will keep Turkey stable.

 &UR; DESPERADO
</P>
<P>
   BY SARAH KERR
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Though it raged for 10 shocking years, the Mexican Revolution
has never been viewed as particularly central to the century that's
about to end -- not like the Russian Revolution, or even the
smaller-scale Spanish Civil War. Probably this is because Mexico's
conflict blurred what we think of as the usual political divides.
</P>
<P>
   The event that triggered it was straightforward enough: In 1910,
President Porfirio Diaz, a quasi dictator who had ``modernized''
the economy with measures favorable to rich people and foreigners,
went back on his pledge not to run for re-election one last time.
(He'd already held office for 30 years.) Annoyance at this
about-face turned into opposition, popular armies sprang up to
fight the federal one and Diaz was forced to step down in 1911. So
far so good, but what followed is much harder to describe.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief period of promise, unity among the rebels went out
the window. Leader after regional leader was assassinated, and even
now, at a distance of many decades, it's hard to judge whether
ideology or ambition or blood feuds were to blame. From such chaos
-- part volcano, part musical chairs -- it's not surprising that
the most celebrated fallen hero of the era should be the man with
the simplest revolutionary program, and the clearest-cut record as
a martyr. Emiliano Zapata fought on behalf of southern peasants to
win back land that Diaz had taken away. His dream of a pastoral,
proudly Indian Mexico was immortalized in utopian murals by Diego
Rivera. His continuing relevance is obvious today in Chiapas, where
a new band of rebels has taken his name.
</P>
<P>
   But where does this leave Pancho Villa, commander of the
greatest revolutionary army in the north? Once upon a time, he was
the one who got top hero billing, with thrilling exploits that
riveted people in the United States as well as in Mexico. If
anything, Friedrich Katz's towering new biography, ``The Life and
Times of Pancho Villa,'' suggests that while he was alive Villa may
have become too big a myth for his own good. To his adherents he
was nothing short of a Robin Hood. To his enemies he was at best a
mercenary bandit, at worst a bloodthirsty fiend, slicing through
crowds with a machete. Katz calls these myths the Epic and the
Black, and he finds both to be something of a stretch, but his own
attitude toward Villa can hardly be called neutral. He is a
historian by profession, and a rather passionate thesis runs
beneath this book, to the effect that history has denied Pancho
Villa his due.
</P>
<P>
   Villa was a genius -- though his wild destiny was not as obvious
in his youth as either myth would have us believe. Little is known
about his early years. It's often said that he was driven to become
an outlaw when someone raped his sister and honor demanded that he
murder the rapist. Katz isn't at all sure that this tale is true;
he's not even sure that the young Villa made such a great bandit.
When war broke out in 1910, he was just another man corraled to
fight the federal forces. Soon enough, though, he rose. Something
he did made men want to follow him. Firsthand testimony invariably
recalls his eyes, electrified with purpose. It's quite ironic,
given the later prevalence of the violent Black myth, that early in
his career Villa was famous for keeping impeccable order among his
troops and safeguarding private property. Men wanted to fight with
him, and villagers wanted his protection, because of all the
leaders available he was the most responsible. (Not with women,
though -- never with women. Villa coaxed countless lovers into bed
by arranging fake marriages, and his courtship of at least one
common-law wife was a quick, efficient rape.)
</P>
<P>
   So what changed over the years? Villa reached his heyday in the
second phase of the revolution, after the liberal president who
replaced Diaz had been murdered in a coup. Loyal to the fallen
man's memory, Villa led his huge northern army against the new
illegitimate president and, soon enough, against competing factions
in the revolution. Katz believes that several times Villa
single-handedly saved Mexico from the reactionaries. At the same
time, his heavy military responsibilities slowed the pace of
political reform.
</P>
<P>
   Compare Villa's task to that faced by Zapata in the south, for
example. Zapata's fighters got to stay in their villages and fight
in relatively minor local skirmishes. Villa's troops had to travel
hundreds of miles and fend off heavy, constant federal attack. This
was distracting, and required money. It also pushed Villa to
postpone land redistribution, which he genuinely believed in, lest
his hard-working troops miss out on the bounty. Add to this mix
some meddling by the United States, a series of betrayals by men
who had once been or even still claimed to be allies and Villa's
utter failure to keep up with new military techniques, which put
his troops in jeopardy. In psychological terms, Villa seems to have
caved in to the stress. In pop psychological terms, you could say
he ``went bad.''
</P>
<P>
   As his power shrank, he misused it more. His judgment, never
very steady, now spun like a roulette wheel. In a desperate (yet it
has to be admitted, clever and daring) bid for attention, he
reversed his pro-American policy and raided the small town of
Columbus, N.M. And he became paranoid and punitive. For the first
time in his career he began to kill large numbers of civilians,
including women -- brutally, and in cold blood.
</P>
<P>
   This is a very long book, at times repetitive in its obeisance
to academic form. It should be noted, too, that Katz is Austrian by
birth, and this book clearly is not written by a native English
speaker. But the research here obviously represents decades of
devotion, and it is formidable. Coming from the Eastern Hemisphere
also appears to have given Katz a broader perspective on the
revolution, one that is sorely needed. Partly owing to its
uniqueness, and partly to neglect by the rest of the world, Mexican
history can feel like quite an insular subject. Over and over, Katz
strives to place Villa in a global context.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-PANCHO-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: global context.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a revolutionary who was written out of history by victorious
rivals, Villa, Katz says, is a little like Trotsky vis-a-vis
Stalin. As a guerrilla leader coming down from the mountains he can
be compared to Fidel Castro. As the charismatic commander of a
large army who grew overconfident in later years, he has something
in common with Napoleon. His extreme loyalty toward his troops also
calls to mind that tragically common 20th-century figure, the Latin
American military dictator. What distinguishes Villa from Trotsky
is that beyond thinking that a handful of rich ranchers had too
much power, he was never terribly fussy about ideology. What
distinguishes him from everyone else on this list is that he came
up from peasant stock, he never really took advantage of his
position to line his pockets (though corrupt sidekicks did, it's
true) and on several occasions when he could have fought his way to
the presidency he backed off. Villa didn't want unlimited power.
All he wanted was to control his home turf in the north. This is
important: Though he stopped short of greatness, he did have a
curious sort of integrity.
</P>
<P>
   His limitations must not be understated. Katz quarrels with the
Black myth, but even if it's highly exaggerated, little about it is
false. A rehabilitation of Villa simply cannot rest on the question
of what he might have done if given the unlimited chance -- the
question is too scary. But a rehabilitation can rest on questions
of memory. At his height, Villa sparked the imagination more than
any other revolutionary leader. His pivotal contributions are still
celebrated in hundreds of popular ballads, but have been played
down in history books.
</P>
<P>
   In 1923, Villa went for a drive and was killed by a
sharpshooter. His death was passed off as the inevitable downfall
of a rascal with many enemies. In fact Katz convincingly implicates
the president at the time, Villa's former military rival, Alvaro
Obregon, in the murder, or at the very least in a cover-up. At this
point, officially speaking, the revolution was over. Mexico had
been reborn as a forward-looking, cooperative family. But even at
this late stage, Villa represented some kind of possibility. He was
a threatening potential, an open question. Debate over his legacy
suggests that he still may be today.

 &UR; 'A WILD, ROVING, VAGABOND LIFE'
</P>
<P>
   BY JAMES R. KINCAID
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sir Richard Burton (1821-90) -- explorer, scholar, ethnologist,
linguist, translator, eroticist -- was, of all the eminent
Victorians, the one most gifted at attracting and keeping enemies.
Not just any enemies either: an alarming number of his particularly
unbalanced contemporaries took up as a duty the job of hating him,
dedicating their lives to getting him. His only major competitor in
the odium limelight was his wife. Isabel (who was 10 years younger
and outlived him by 6 years), a practiced officious meddler and
irritant to the important during her husband's life, saved her best
shot for after his death: legend has it that she burned her
husband's papers (diaries, manuscripts) at his death in a frenzy of
bluenosed righteousness and then, worse, mounted a tireless but
absurd defense of her literary and cultural crime. As a result,
Isabel magnetized the well-oiled detestation not only of the poet
Swinburne and a host of her contemporaries but of nearly every
scholar and certainly every biographer since. What a couple. Her
husband seems to have combined the least attractive traits of Mike
Tyson, Oliver North and Larry Flynt; she of Tipper Gore, Leona
Helmsley and Tonya Harding. This, anyhow, is the received view.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. Mary S. Lovell, the author of biographies of Jane
Digby, Amelia Earhart and Beryl Markham, opens her book by telling
us that the one thing we all know about Isabel, that she was a
literary arsonist, is wrong. She started a fire, certainly, and
some of Burton's letters, along with one important manuscript, were
in it; but much, including his diaries, was not. More significant,
she was not a mindless hysteric, Lovell shows, but a competent and
judicious woman who knew what she was doing. What she was doing was
protecting her husband's reputation from his enemies and from the
publishers of pornography she felt were sure to get his latest
scholarly erotica (``The Scented Garden'') into the wrong hands --
those who sought erotic pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   There is much new material in ``A Rage to Live,'' an
extraordinary biography, and at least as much writing that is
clever and persuasive as there is special pleading, as much that is
moving as is silly. Trying to write the biographies of two people
who lived much of their lives before they were together and, after
that, were very often not together for long periods involves Lovell
in a lot of straddling and even more wild hopping back and forth:
but let us turn now from the pleasant salons of London to the dark
jungles of Africa, from the tinkle of laughing voices to the roar
of panthers. Still, Lovell convinces me that we have made a set of
serious blunders in understanding Isabel, the marriage, Burton and
the accomplishments of both people.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an easy job to suggest that any two human beings are
happy for any length of time, much less marshal evidence that will
persuade the jaded that the Burtons' life together was ``a mutual
joy,'' beneficial to both. Lovell shows that Isabel was, without
doubt, a powerful and courageous woman who could swim with the
sharks and fence; act as collaborator, editor and literary agent;
ride and shoot and treat rattlesnake bites; get herself and Burton
presented to the Queen and asked to dine with the Prime Minister;
write and think. It is hardly to our credit that we have so readily
constructed Isabel as another of those shrews-married-to-genius:
ignorant, intolerant and -- oh, it's a shame he got married at all!
Anyhow, now we have little choice but to see that we were wrong
altogether and that as a consequence Isabel, her husband and the
whole era are more complex and sometimes lovelier than we supposed.
</P>
<P>
   THE main events of Burton's life are well known but still
difficult to keep track of, encompass or even believe. Lovell tells
this sweeping story with clarity and efficiency, and with a
partisan bias that is sometimes vigorously intelligent and
sometimes just vigorous. She says, for instance, that she has
``unearthed a great deal of previously unpublished material which
demonstrates that Burton was heterosexual,'' not homosexual, not
``crypto-homosexual,'' not ``bisexual'' or any other invention
foisted on him by biographers ready to apply ``some fashionable
psychiatric spin to increase readership.'' She pursues this line
with evident but mysterious pride: ``I am absolutely certain . . .
that there is no historical evidence to support the theory that
Burton was homosexual.''
</P>
<P>
   What a very odd claim. It's hard to know what would count for
``evidence'' with someone confident she has scoured the past; and
she will not listen to anyone pointing to Burton's obsessive
writings on homosexuality and on pederasty, his comments on the
pretty-boy ``blue eyes and blond hair'' and ``childlike
simplicity'' of John Hanning Speke, the explorer of Africa, or
Burton's rushing about Africa measuring men's penises. Nonsense!
Lovell snorts; Burton was simply a scholar, interested in
everything, ``all aspects of sexual anthropology, and the more
bizarre the act the greater was his interest.'' Biographers would
be better served asking more calmly questions that matter and that
expose less ominously their own ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   However, the material on Burton is generally solid and secure,
judicious and sometimes even wry. Lovell admires Burton
immoderately, but she recognizes she is hugging a porcupine. The
man known during his younger days in India as Ruffian Dick -- and
later as a murderer, impostor, betrayer, pornographer, atheist (or
Muslim), sexual adventurer and, hang it all, no gentleman -- was
certainly hampered by a reputation he also carefully cultivated, in
no small part by lying or by telling wild stories about himself and
allowing others to believe them. Lovell shows that he also made
mistakes, and she is almost too quick to spot plots against him;
but this was a man who loved to detect boobies, toadies, frauds and
then tell them (and others) about his discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   He was astonishingly gifted and did not put a bushel over those
shining gifts: ``It is not my fault,'' he wrote in one of his
prefaces, ``if I am better educated than my fellows.'' Doubtless
not, but it's not the sort of approach calculated to win our
hearts. He struck (and that's the right word) his contemporaries as
violence about to happen: as a youth, he ran his fencing foil
through the back of his brother's mouth and bashed his violin over
his music master's head. He so hated the idea of entering the
church that he got himself rusticated from Oxford with noisy
parties and widely distributed caricatures of dons and tutors,
along with defiance of rules that stopped just short of busted
skulls. He didn't stop there, though he did not, Lovell thinks, get
himself caught and castrated, murder natives left and right,
involve himself in countless duels with jealous husbands or eat a
cabin boy. He just delighted in the fact that others thought so.
</P>
<P>
   Burton lived by trying to stun and stupefy all around him, and
he nearly stupefies this biographer. Lovell does have superb
narrative gifts, and she makes this life, which would be
interesting even if told by a colleague of mine who can make
``Oedipus Tyrannus'' sound humdrum, exciting. Burton, after all,
not only was part of the ``Great Game'' of espionage in India but
fought in the Crimean War, launched several bold and controversial
African explorations, became a principal figure in the battle over
the source of the Nile and, disguised as an Arab
merchant-magician-dervish-fortuneteller, managed to penetrate the
forbidden city of Mecca. He served the Foreign Office in posts in
West Africa, Brazil and Syria, and made important trips (recorded
in important books) to many other spots, including Iceland and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-BURTON-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: United States.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He knew about 30 languages and innumerable difficult dialects,
and his ethnological, linguistic and geographical work was tireless
and brilliant. He published nearly 40 volumes on his explorations
alone, along with grammars and volumes of folklore; he produced
unexpurgated translations of Eastern erotica: ``The Arabian
Nights,'' ``The Kama Sutra'' and ``The Perfumed Garden of the
Cheikh Nefzaoui,'' thus charting a collision course with the
National Vigilance Society and the Society for the Suppression of
Vice. He seems to have lived every minute restlessly and with
unrelaxed pugnacity, on the watch for something new to learn and
somebody new to offend. Lovell gives this part of her story a
generous and uncluttered airing.
</P>
<P>
   BUT it is with Isabel, the woman who became at least as
unpopular as her husband, that Lovell is most eloquent and
persuasive. She has indeed unearthed new material, and she uses it
to build a new Isabel, one who is as resolutely tactless as her
husband but also as courageous, defiant and smart. This new Isabel
will not strike many as down-home likable, but I do not see how
anyone can now judge her easily or harshly. Lovell finds her
admirable, and so do I: she faced arduous challenges and even
harder decisions, and she charged into them with the extraordinary
gumption of a woman who knew how to bully and how to be loyal.
Isabel knew from the start that she was destined to marry Burton,
partly because she was sickened by the ordinary mild lot of women
and was athirst for something much riskier and partly because a
Gypsy fortuneteller had forecast that she was destined to marry one
who had the name of the Gypsy tribe, and that name was -- ta-dah!
-- Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Isabel was, for all her tough-minded independence, somewhat
wackily superstitious, and not just when it came to Gypsy queens.
She loved to be hypnotized, insisted that Richard could call to her
from across great distances, felt herself to be both psychic and
clairvoyant, and held fast to dreams and omens. She was, in this
light, someone ``who had strayed from the Middle Ages,'' as her
husband affectionately put it. Her premarital musings about Burton
-- ``he unites the wild, lawless creature and the gentleman'' --
sound like Isabella Linton dribbling on about Heathcliff, and we
might expect a similar rude awakening. However, it turns out that
Isabel knows Burton and knows herself: ``I wish I were a man. If I
were I would be Richard Burton; but, being only a woman, I would be
Richard Burton's wife.'' There is no doubt that she worshiped him,
but she did not so much submit herself to him as unite with him in
doing what she wanted to do all along: find perilous adventure in
the jungles and deserts, in the polite social world and in the life
of the mind. She wanted, she said, ``a wild, roving, vagabond
life,'' and Burton had it to give to her.
</P>
<P>
   Lovell is perhaps overenthusiastic in assuring us that all parts
of this marriage, including the sexual part, were terrific. Just
because they shared an ``intimate dialogue'' and Burton
(unquestionably) had an ``interest in erotic techniques'' might not
lead us to conclude that it was ``likely that their sex life was
both mutually satisfying and continuously interesting.'' I am happy
that Lovell generously supposes so, but maybe she has secrets on
this not revealed to me.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Lovell's new material shows that without
question Isabel worked closely with Burton, and not just as a
scribe or researcher. She was his editor, agent and often his
co-author. It was largely this partnership that led to her
unpopularity, as she went about, with her customary dash, plugging
and defending his works and reputation. She was determined to get
him knighted, and did. She was also on the alert to see that he
received credit, was never viewed uncharitably and was seen always
by everyone ``in the same uncritical light'' that she threw on her
beloved. In this, she was not only less successful but managed to
make herself thorny and obnoxious to many. Even here, however,
Lovell brilliantly shows how her defects were the reflexes of her
large, openhearted strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Lovell writes with a zeal that seems to ring right out of Isabel
herself. This biography is both admirably scholarly and, now and
then, engagingly reckless. Lovell has transformed our view of the
Burtons and their accomplishments, but she has not kept her own
crotchets under a very short rein. For one thing, the biography is
not a book you will wish longer. Lovell laments the fact that she
had to lose a third of what she wanted to put in to make this
wallowing volume less obese; she will be alone in her wailing. She
falls so deeply in love with this couple -- an amiable but decisive
failing -- that she can become frenzied in her admiration:
certainly Burton was not ``possibly unique among his English
contemporaries'' in believing that married women should ``enjoy the
sexual act as well as the man,'' and it does not seem to me that
``it was generally accepted, even by his enemies, that he had 'the
best mind of his generation.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This doting zeal can lead Lovell often to become zanily
defensive. She notes that Burton rarely mentions his mother at all,
but that doesn't mean he didn't love her. Oh, no: ``That he loved
his mother, as he loved all his family, is beyond question.'' You
get the feeling you'd better not question it or Lovell might aim
her own fencing foil at the back of your mouth. Nor can you defend
Speke, who comes across here as surely the most repellent man of
his century or any other. The fact that Burton wrote so openly
about his own heavy drinking may not, in itself, ``discount . . .
any unhealthy dependence on alcohol,'' and I don't know if it's
much of a defense of his bigoted comments on Africans to note that
he was, after all, bigoted about lots of things. Is it really
necessary to ask, ``Who can blame them?'' when Richard and Isabel
cheer at the news that an old enemy has been assassinated? And is
it comely to bristle at the common report that Isabel was fat? ``At
11 stones (154 lbs.) she was hardly seriously overweight for her
height.''
</P>
<P>
   Such obsessions now and then detract Lovell from telling us what
we need to know: Burton is plopped into the middle of the Crimean
War without so much as a how-de-do about what that war is all
about. Worse, there are some errors that somebody should have
caught: there are no 28,000-foot peaks in the Andes; Oscar Wilde
was not convicted under the Obscene Publications Act.
</P>
<P>
   But even the errors are amiable, as is Lovell's identification
with Isabel's grief. She enters into Isabel's designs for Richard's
tomb, a tentlike mausoleum, equipped with ``festoons of camel
bells'' to provide the sort of ``tinkling,'' she said, that would
make it seem just like the desert. Grieving widows cannot be
criticized on matters of taste, but Lovell probably didn't have to
entitle her penultimate chapter ``Last Tinkle of the Camel Bell''
or report on Isabel's own funeral quite so evocatively: ``Above the
voices of the priest and the choir . . . strings of camel bells
tinkled gaily in the brisk spring breeze.'' I find myself admiring
Isabel almost as much as I admire Lovell; but I wouldn't want
either of them in charge of my funeral arrangements. I have just
told Mrs. K.: no camel bells.

 &UR; BLAMING WITTGENSTEIN
</P>
<P>
   BY PAUL MATTICK
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Gellner (1925-95) first achieved fame in 1959 with an
attack on Oxford-style linguistic philosophy, ``Words and Things.''
The philosophers in question put up a fight, but their day is long
done. After 30 years of writing and teaching in a number of English
universities about a range of topics including psychoanalysis,
Muslim society and nationalism, Gellner returned to the fray in
``Language and Solitude.'' As before, his primary target is Ludwig
Wittgenstein, presented now not only as the presiding genius of a
defunct philosophical school but as the patron saint of a general
intellectual trend that represents the infection of the humanities
by the romantic nationalism that wreaked so much havoc in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Gellner wrote on the assumption that his readers were also
familiar with texts and ideas he thought about for a lifetime.
Despite the difficulties that assumption can produce, this
posthumous book, studded with ideas like a little roast with
truffles, will pleasurably provoke those who persevere.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gellner, the transformation of the ``closed,
intimate communities'' in which most people once lived into open,
large-scale market systems produced ``the central problem facing
contemporary societies,'' the seemingly irresolvable conflict
between an individualistic mode of thought and the desire for the
spiritual comfort of community. Gellner argues that ever since
Descartes responded to the clash between religion and 17th-century
science by trying to create a body of knowledge on the basis of
nothing but his own experience and reason, philosophy has called
into question the claims of culture over the mind and even the
sense of self of an individual in the social world. It also,
however, called into being its opposite, he says, a romantic
insistence on community and culture as the necessary matrix of
selfhood, knowledge and ethical life.
</P>
<P>
   Neither view, according to Gellner, provides an adequate picture
of human society and knowledge. But both tell partial truths.
Individuals derive their aims and needs from the cultures they live
in. On the other hand, the idea of independent truth put together
by rational individuals made possible the development of modern
science and the world-changing power of industrial society.
</P>
<P>
   How did it happen, then, that a thinker like Wittgenstein could
found a school of philosophy on the rejection of that idea?
Because, Gellner thinks, of the particular society from which he
came and his position in it. In its last decades the Hapsburg
empire held together a seething collection of would-be states with
a strange combination of Catholic absolutism and cosmopolitan
liberalism. Under these circumstances, members of an educated
Jewish bourgeoisie, excluded and threatened by the
back-to-the-roots ideology of the nationalists, had every cause to
combine their liberalism with loyalty to the ``old and rigid
dynasty, long linked with hierarchy, authoritarianism and
obscurantist dogmatism.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wittgenstein's first book, the ``Tractatus
Logico-Philosophicus'' (1921), abstract individualism reached a
dizzying height Gellner describes as autistic. The ``Tractatus''
sketches a world peopled only by the philosophical self, whose
experience is structured only by the flattened-out schemata of
logic. Culture, in other words, does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1930's Wittgenstein was abandoning these views -- not so
much, Gellner thinks, because they are untenable as because the
cosmic loneliness they depict was finally unbearable. Given the
polarization of Hapsburg politics, the only alternative seemed to
be a philosophical version of nationalism. This is the ruling idea
of Wittgenstein's ``Philosophical Investigations,'' the late work
that ``positively outlaws the very idea of social criticism by
making every culture sovereign, self-validating, ultimate.''
Gellner thinks that while the popularity of ideas like these among
philosophers was fostered by the particular circumstances of
Oxford, the complacency of the 1950's was also to blame, just as
the obsession of intellectuals in the 90's with closed worlds of
meaning reflects both the repudiation of Western chauvinism and the
abandonment of a critical attitude toward cultural givens.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hapsburg empire also produced an alternative to
Wittgenstein's unsatisfactory dualism: the cultural anthropology of
another exile from Mitteleuropa, Bronislaw Malinowski. While
Vienna's Wittgenstein was busy seducing philosophical minds at
Cambridge, Cracow's Malinowski was founding modern anthropology at
the London School of Economics, focusing on understanding the
interrelationships between the parts of cultures. Where
Wittgenstein insisted that one can understand culture only from
within, Malinowski studied it from without, regarding it, Gellner
suggests, from the viewpoint of the colonial administrator, whose
own culture claimed the transcendent status of science. The
political consequence Malinowski drew from his anthropology was the
need for a supranational authority that would limit national
sovereignty while respecting freedom of cultural expression.
Gellner concedes that this idea may not be realistic, but it is, he
insists, ``our only hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Gellner, surprisingly, does not consider the possible source of
Malinowski's politics in the empire of his origin as well as the
British one in which he spent most of his life. Perhaps this is
because Gellner's thinking is so close to Malinowski's that he
echoes Malinowski's contrast of ``savage thought'' with modern
science. But it is not just today's relativism that rules out
Gellner's portrayal of ``civilized'' thinking as ideally
``context-free.'' Gellner himself quotes Malinowski's observation
that scientific books are addressed to those who have ``the
necessary scientific training'' -- that is, to those educated by
the authorities of a science-oriented culture.
</P>
<P>
   If we are going to look for understanding of our predicament in
anthropology rather than in philosophy -- in my view, not a bad
idea -- we will have to do fieldwork on our own culture as well as
on ``savages.'' Gellner leaves modern society almost entirely
unanalyzed; we are told only that ``one day'' in history ``a new
style of cognition emerged'' that eventually produced ``industrial
society.'' What social transformations gave rise to both scientific
universalism and nationalism? This question doesn't arise in
Gellner's way of thinking, but ``Language and Solitude'' has the
virtue of leading us right to it.

 &UR; POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE
</P>
<P>
   BY PERRY MEISEL
</P>

   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Brooke is remembered less for his poems than for his good
looks and less for his good looks than for the way he abused his
friends with them. On the receiving end first and longest among the
men and the women Brooke loved before his death from blood
poisoning en route to the Turkish front at Gallipoli in 1915 was
James Strachey, the younger brother of Lytton Strachey and the
future translator and editor of Freud. Although Brooke's
correspondence was published in 1968, the exchange of letters
between Brooke and Strachey was excluded by its editor, Geoffrey
Keynes, one of Brooke's moralizing Cambridge friends. Now Keith
Hale, an assistant professor of English at the University of Guam,
has edited and introduced the correspondence with skill and
thoroughness. It is almost impossible to read it without sensing
Brooke's and Strachey's vivid feeling for each other and the extent
to which the bond between them structured their lives. It will no
longer be possible to speak of either one separately.
</P>
<P>
   Brooke and Strachey met at Hillbrow School in 1897 when each was
10. They were extraordinarily competitive. In 1901, Brooke returned
to Rugby, where his father was a housemaster; Strachey returned to
his large family in London, where he became a day boy at St.
Paul's. As Strachey had ardently hoped, he and Brooke were reunited
at Cambridge in the autumn of 1906. There they made the passage
from being precocious, overeducated English schoolboys to being
self-impressed Cambridge undergraduates who did not even consider
the question of their own identities until their election to the
Apostles, or Cambridge Conversazione Society, the secret
organization that had been created at midcentury to counter
Oxford's control of English taste, and that now included Lytton
Strachey and John Maynard Keynes among its principal members.
</P>
<P>
   These are love letters as well as missives of two Apostolic
friends (indeed, the relation between lust and friendship was often
among the topics of Apostolic discussion), and they flesh out,
often in rough-and-tumble detail, what was regarded as a perfectly
open way of life, even when both turned to the pursuit of women.
While Strachey is ordinarily cool and rationalistic, he is, as a
lover, fervent and passionate. And while Brooke is customarily
ardent and passionate, he is, as a lover, demure and condescending.
``It's your soul that I long for,'' Strachey writes in 1909. ``We
will not be sentimental about anything,'' Brooke replies, ``except
nobility.'' The sadism lasts until the end, even though Strachey
grows more relaxed and secure. Brooke, however, grows more and more
unsettled, quarreling with Bloomsbury and wandering in America and
the Pacific. ``I've loved you all the time,'' Strachey writes in
1913. A month later, Brooke replies, ``You'd better go on hating
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Hale's exhaustive editorial work, his volume sheds
little new light on Brooke as a poet. Like most critics, Hale
believes that the jingoistic masterstrokes of Brooke's famous war
sonnets represent a turn away from the ``decadent stance'' of
Brooke's youth, even though their sharp relation to death and exile
also makes them continuous with High Romantic schoolboy poems like
``The Bastille.'' Nor does Hale deal with Strachey's work.
Translating Freud meant exchanging his older brother's authority
for that of an even greater ironist, and letting fresh air of his
own into Bloomsbury's pantry. Psychoanalysis gave Strachey an
escape from English tradition that Brooke could not find, allowing
him to reinvent its Romantic premises rather than trying to
reimagine them.

 THE BURDEN OF MEMORY, THE MUSE OF FORGIVENESS

 &UR; TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION
</P>
<P>
   BY CARYL PHILLIPS
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In Wole Soyinka's last volume, ``The Open Sore of a Continent: A
Personal Narrative of the Nigerian Crisis'' (1996), the Nobel
laureate lamented the fact that the democratically elected leader
of his country, Moshood Abiola, was languishing in jail, while Gen.
Sani Abacha, the dictator who had imprisoned Abiola (and also
confiscated Soyinka's passport), continued to rule unopposed. Three
years on, both Abiola and Abacha are dead, and Soyinka has returned
to Nigeria. But he is still addressing issues related not only to
Africa but to the diaspora as well. In ``The Burden of Memory, the
Muse of Forgiveness,'' his new volume of three essays, Soyinka
squares up to the vexing question of whether the West owes those of
African origin reparations for centuries of ill-usage.
</P>
<P>
   The first essay, ``Reparations, Truth and Reconciliation,''
states its case boldly. While he is observing the hearings of the
South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, it occurs to
Soyinka that the problem with the method being employed is that it
allows the defendants to be questioned as though they were not
criminals, relieving them of any onus to take responsibility for
their past actions. Soyinka is adamant that justice is not ``served
by discharging the guilty without evidence of mitigation -- or
remorse.'' His indignation at having detected the lack of a moral
ingredient in this process leads him to speculate about the
concomitant lack of a material ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   Soyinka builds his case for reparations by arguing that without
a material payment for the crimes committed against African people,
the resentment and hatred engendered by the original actions will
simply continue to simmer. ``Where there has been inequity,
especially of a singularly brutalizing kind, of a kind that robs
one side of its most fundamental attribute -- its humanity -- it
seems only appropriate that some form of atonement be made, in
order to exorcise that past. Reparations, we repeat, serve as a
cogent critique of history and thus a potent restraint on its
repetition.''
</P>
<P>
   While Soyinka offers no real evidence that cash or other forms
of payment can seriously disrupt the often cyclical patterns of
history, he does admit that there are grave problems that surround
the question of how much, and whom, to pay. He once addressed
executives from the World Bank and suggested to them that the
slaving nations simply annul the debts of the African world and the
African nations would, in turn, wipe clean the slate of injustice
from the wounds of the past. The executives were not impressed, and
Soyinka quickly realized the impractical nature of his own
suggestion. However, his present-day plea for reparations is
equally flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Soyinka points to recent evidence of the practice of reparations
and wonders why the African world is being left out of this ``fever
of atonement.'' He identifies the rehabilitation of the victims of
the 1692 Salem witch hunt; the Japanese apology and compensation
fund for Korean women forced into prostitution during World War II;
the Spanish Government's acknowledgment that the 1492 edict
evicting the Jews from Spain was wrong. However, these seem to be
particularly unconvincing examples when set against the huge and
complicated problem of how to compensate a continent and its
diaspora abroad for centuries of exploitation, some of which they
contributed to themselves. In the end, it is clear that the task of
formulating a strategy for reparations lies beyond the scope of
this single essay and, for all his political acumen, beyond the
brief of Wole Soyinka, writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``L. S. Senghor and Negritude'' and ``Negritude and the Gods of
Equity,'' the two essays that make up the remainder of the volume,
find Soyinka exploring the philosophical impulse that he feels
impels those of the African world to seek a premature closure to
their travails by freely forgiving their victimizers. In the life
and work of the great poet of negritude, former President Leopold
Senghor of Senegal, Soyinka locates the literary equivalent of the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The term negritude was first coined by the Martinican poet Aime
Cesaire, and it was very much a Francophone response to such
American black-consciousness poets as Langston Hughes, Countee
Cullen and James Weldon Johnson. The negritude movement assumed
that culture was racially specific, and that the culture of African
peoples, rather than being something to be ashamed of, should be
celebrated. However, this did not mean that French culture was to
be rejected; far from it. Senghor, who became the first African
member of the French Academy, eventually replaced his affection for
negritude with a vigorously expressed affiliation to what he termed
metissage, or cultural cross-fertilization, in which French culture
symbolized the apotheosis of human civilization. These
assimilationist Francophone writers fascinate Soyinka because he
sees them as the progenitors of this desire to lay down the burden
of memory and embrace the muse of forgiveness, which, in his view,
taints Africa and Africans.
</P>
<P>
   When Soyinka yokes the literary to the political, and explores
the reasons why negritude never took hold in the English-speaking
world, he is both inspiring and original. He reflects upon the
manner in which Africa has been viewed from the diaspora as either
``past continuous'' or ``nostalgic past,'' depending upon whether
one is observing the continent from the United States or from the
Caribbean, and as he does so it becomes clear that the free-ranging
form of the essay is perfectly suited to Soyinka's restless mode of
thought and his incantatory style of delivery. The essay form,
however, also brings out the worst in Soyinka, for it encourages
him to wallow in excessive imagery that draws attention to the
language employed rather than to the point that he is trying to
make.
</P>
<P>
   Soyinka's analysis of the 20th-century problem of memory and
forgiveness in the African world is both timely and important.
Africa cannot afford to endure another century of accommodating the
West and at the same time failing to discipline its own so-called
leaders. It cannot afford another century in which it slips easily
from acknowledged ``truth'' to convenient ``reconciliation''
without adopting a more rigorous form of self-examination and a
more confrontational attitude toward its former colonial masters.
Soyinka's analysis of the problem is an initial volley in what will
surely become a 21st-century debate.

 EARTH ODYSSEY

<P>
   In Search of Our Environmental Future.

   By Mark Hertsgaard.

 &UR; A DIRTY SHAME
</P>
<P>
   BY KEITH SCHNEIDER
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hertsgaard'S reputation as an astute journalist was made in
the 1980's when as a magazine and book writer he explored politics,
the press and pop culture. His best-known work, ``On Bended Knee:
The Press and the Reagan Presidency'' (1988), described the way the
Reagan White House deployed raw power and conventional wisdom to
intimidate Washington's television newsrooms. In the 1990's, his
attention turned to the even more formidable: the ecological fate
of the earth. Hertsgaard embarked upon a seven-year global tour to
investigate the environmental future. The journey spanned four
continents, 19 countries and hundreds of interviews. Hertsgaard
spoke with Vaclav Havel in Prague, he talked with industrial
workers in soot-choked China and retraced Winston Churchill's steps
in North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Hertsgaard's central question in 1991 was ``whether the human
species would survive the next hundred years.'' By the time he
returned in the late 1990's to write in a cabin amid a majestic
grove of California sequoias, he was convinced the answer was yes.
But he finds few other reasons to be optimistic: The pace of global
population growth, rampant air and water pollution in the
developing world and the weakening resolve of the United States to
lead the environmental revolution it fostered spell big trouble for
the quality of human existence.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is hardly a novel message. But Hertsgaard is
after something different from the annual compendium of trends in
the planet's failing health put out by Lester R. Brown's Worldwatch
Institute, or the eloquent assessment, in Bill McKibben's ``End of
Nature,'' of the risks to the environment and the economy posed by
global climate change. Hertsgaard's focus is the human dimension to
global ecological decline, and in ``Earth Odyssey,'' he displays an
authentic talent for storytelling. By taking care to explain the
technical, by including just enough of himself and by giving full
breath to select characters, he has transformed a daunting subject
into a stirring contribution to the growing literature on the
global environment.
</P>
<P>
   The path Hertsgaard takes around the world is full of surprises
and unexplored places. Just as important, he does not berate or
moralize. His tone is generally that of an interested and
accomplished reporter seeking to understand communities and
assemble a foundation of facts from which to draw conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The chapters on China are especially satisfying. In Chongqing, a
southwestern industrial city, Hertsgaard investigates a chlorine
plant that officials say is closed, but continues to operate and
pour a toxic waterfall of raw chlorine and other chemicals directly
into the Jialing River, a drinking water source for millions of
people. But this was hardly the worst pollution he saw there.
</P>
<P>
   Though residents of China's cities rarely see blue sky because
of air pollution caused by burning coal, and rivers are so choked
by raw sewage and chemical wastes that fish cannot survive, China's
1.2 billion people are still motivated by one concern. They want to
make enough money to escape poverty, joblessness and cramped living
conditions that Americans would never tolerate. Western
environmental concerns seem so inconsequential as to be almost
laughable. ``You may complain about our contributions to global
warming or the ozone hole,'' Hertsgaard is told. ``But how much
pollution we make, how many trees we cut or dams we build is
nobody's business but ours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Social forces have been set in motion that will not be
contained,'' Hertsgaard writes. ``Electricity, telephones, running
water -- once humans experience these things, they want more of
them, no matter the ecological cost. As well they might. It is easy
for outsiders to warn against the long-term costs of damming
Africa's rivers, ruining its scenery, or destroying its woodlands,
but it is akin to a glutton admonishing a beggar on the evil of
carbohydrates -- he lacks a certain moral authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Where ``Earth Odyssey'' falters is its recommendations.
Hertsgaard's survey of the potential fixes for a world being
disfigured by the passion for wealth -- technology improvements,
more efficiently using resources, minimizing waste, even shifting
taxes to penalize pollution -- is so bogged down in statistics and
theory that it's like breathing through a dishrag. Hertsgaard could
have remedied this problem by focusing more intensely on the
solution he knows the most about: politics and government.
</P>
<P>
   It's been little more than a generation since the United States
invented and enacted the program that cleaned the air, cleared the
water and safeguarded millions of acres of wild lands. Presidents
of both parties and bipartisan Congressional action provided the
political foundation for visionary people to do something great.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960's, for example, Stewart L. Udall, the Secretary of
the Interior during eight years of the Kennedy and Johnson
Administrations, established four national parks, six national
monuments, nine national recreation areas, 20 national historic
sites and nine national lakeshores and seashores. Udall also wrote
the 1964 Wilderness Act, which preserved tens of millions of acres
of wild land, and helped to gain passage of the 1968 Wild and
Scenic Rivers Act. He championed Rachel Carson's warning about
toxic chemicals and set the stage for the pioneering environmental
legislation of the 1970's.
</P>
<P>
   The question Hertsgaard needed to address is why Washington
turned meek. It's not enough to spend pages criticizing Vice
President Al Gore for failing to act on a vow to make the
environment the ``central organizing principle'' of governance --
the conclusion of Gore's best-selling book ``The Earth in the
Balance'' (1992). Gore works in an economic and historic context
that has shrunk the political comfort zone for courageous policy
making. Business owners, lawmakers, the press and ultimately voters
are apparently satisfied with mediocre governing. Until the
political market for inspired ideas and passionate leadership
reawakens in the United States, what Hertsgaard calls ``the
material striving of the entire human family'' will never be
reconciled with the carrying capacity of the planet's environment.

   Norton, $18 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   A music critic for The New York Times portrays Thomson as both a
vivacious Midwesterner affected by the hymns and band concerts of
his childhood, and a man capable of baffling cruelty. In 1997 our
reviewer, Nicholas Fox Weber, said this biography ``evokes the

   CHARMING BILLY
</P>
<P>
   By Alice McDermott.
</P>
<P>
   Delta, $12.95 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In a Bronx bar where the friends and family of a dreamy,
hard-drinking Irish-American named Billy Lynch gather after his
funeral, a corrosive 40-year-old lie about a woman tragically lost
and presumed dead is gradually unraveled. This novel, which won a
National Book Award in 1998, is about the power of romantic
mythmaking and the way a person's life can be shaped by the
expectations of others. Last year in the Book Review, Alida Becker
called it an ``eloquent and unsettling'' tale that ``like its title
character . . . works on our sympathies with an insistent sadness
and an ingratiating charm.'' The same publisher has reissued
McDermott's earlier novels, including That Night ($12.95), which
centers on a battle that breaks out in a Long Island suburb when
the parents of a pregnant teen-ager try to keep her from her
hoodlum boyfriend. In 1987 our reviewer, David Leavitt, admired the
``almost baroque richness of McDermott's sentences, the
intellectual complexity of her moral vision and the explicit
emotion of her voice.'' In A Bigamist's Daughter ($12.95), a young
woman working at a vanity press becomes involved with a novelist
whose work-in-progress about a bigamist stirs troubling memories of
her own elusive father. In 1982 in these pages, Anne Tyler said
``McDermott . . . writes with assurance and skill, and she has
created a fascinatingly prismatic story.''

</P>
<P>
   A physical anthropologist reveals how man's best friend was many
things to many peoples before the Europeans arrived in the Americas
in the 1500's. In some places dogs were revered as deities, in
others eaten as dinner. In 1997 our reviewer, Timothy Foote, called
this ``a fascinating, scholarly mishmash, with extraordinary
drawings.'' Eminent Dogs, Dangerous Men, by Donald McCaig (Lyons,
$14.95), chronicles the author's difficult search through Scotland
for the perfect border collie to herd sheep on his Virginia farm.
This ``lively travelogue-history'' is ``rich in dog lore and by no
means poor as a study of human behavior,'' Christopher
Lehmann-Haupt wrote in The Times in 1991.

   BURDEN OF DESIRE

<P>
   After a French freighter explodes and destroys part of Halifax,
Nova Scotia, in 1917, a clergyman stumbles onto a woman's
passionate diary, falls in love with its author and enlists a
friend to help track her down. In 1992 our reviewer, Susan Fromberg
Schaeffer, called this ``a novel filled with riches and alight with
understanding of the small events that lead to the huge upheavals
in life.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the current -- and expected -- effects of computers
and networking on everything from air travel to the financial
markets, the author argues that automation is making it nearly
impossible for people to make modest mistakes and learn from them.
In 1997 in these pages, Lawrence Hunter called this ``an insightful
and painstakingly documented book.'' Crystal Fire: The Invention of
the Transistor and the Birth of the Information Age, by Michael
Riordan and Lillian Hoddeson (Norton, $15), traces the careers of
three American physicists whose work paved the way for today's
microprocessor chips. ``Riordan and Hoddeson reconstruct the birth
of the transistor with considerable aplomb,'' John Durant wrote
here last year.

<P>
   By John Mortimer.
</P>

   Penguin, $12.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This British author's 27th book is a comic romp about a feckless
novelist who gets caught up in paternity-suit blackmail and murder
during a nightmarish book tour. In 1997 in the Book Review,
Christopher Buckley called this a ``witty work, reminiscent of
other late-period novels like Kingsley Amis's 'Russian Girl' and
Peter De Vries's 'Peckham's Marbles.' ''

   Many of the vaguely confused characters in these tales are
transplanted Northerners adrift in New Orleans and southern
Louisiana but unable to move on. '' 'Dream State' successfully
presents a fresh version of the Deep South, one that is exotic
without being either grotesque or romanticized,'' Gary Krist said
here in 1995.

   The enigmatic Bruce Chatwin, who died of AIDS at the age of 48,
is portrayed by his first editor as a brilliant travel writer and
novelist, and an immensely talented art dealer. This is an
``adoring memoir'' by an observer ``graced with a special vantage
on his life and work,'' William Ferguson said here in 1997.

 &UR; CHILDREN'S BOOKS
</P>
<P>
   By BETSY GROBAN (Distributed by New York Times Special
Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone would argue with the naturalist Wilson A.
Bentley's assertion that ``of all the forms of water, the tiny
six-pointed crystals of ice called snow . . . are incomparably the
most beautiful and varied.'' But almost no one would devote more
than 50 years to the close examination of this natural phenomenon,
as he did.
</P>
<P>
   We are, however, immeasurably richer for Bentley's scientific
inquiry. Before he began his research in the late 19th century,
virtually nothing was known about snowflakes; certainly no one
realized what almost everyone now knows: that every single
snowflake is unique. Bentley was born in 1865, and as a child in
the snow belt of Vermont, where annual snowfall can exceed 120
inches, he became fascinated with learning about, analyzing,
capturing and drawing snowflakes. His interest elicited the
ridicule of his neighbors, who considered snow ``as common as
dirt'' and couldn't imagine why anyone would want to know more
about it. But Bentley couldn't bear knowing that when a snowflake
melted away, ``that much beauty was gone, without leaving any
record behind.'' Fortunately, his parents were more than
supportive: they spent their savings on an expensive combination
camera and microscope for their son. The camera was ``taller than a
newborn calf, and cost as much as his father's herd of 10 cows.''
The rest, as they say, is history.
</P>
<P>
   In a story both lyrical and informative, Jacqueline Briggs
Martin traces the life of this self-taught and determined
scientist-farmer from his childhood obsession through the
recognition that followed on his publication of ``Snow Crystals,''
a book of snowflake photographs that is still in use today, to his
death in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snowflake Bentley'' is a tale of intense dedication to
something both mundane and glorious, and thus, I suspect, will
fascinate children. And Mary Azarian's lovely, perfectly pitched
color woodcuts evoke the simple landscape of life in
turn-of-the-century rural Vermont as well as the wonder of snow,
snow, everywhere. Several of Bentley's photographs are included, as
well as a photo of him using his beloved camera. There are also
source notes for the biographical information. This is picture-book
biography at its very best: written like a prose poem and
beautifully illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Snow,'' Uri Shulevitz, the author and illustrator of many
prizewinning books, uses the white stuff in a totally different
fashion. Here it becomes a metaphor for the faith young children
possess in the face of an adult world lacking in vision and
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   When a small fellow, ``boy with dog,'' encounters the first
snowflakes of the season, he is certain that much more is on its
way. The boy and the dog pass through their dreary gray town trying
to spread the good word about the impending storm. But they are met
time and again with the skepticism of disbelieving grown-ups: ''
'It's only a snowflake,' said grandfather with beard.'' (Try
telling that to Wilson Bentley!)
</P>
<P>
   When the snowstorm finally, inevitably arrives, ``circling and
swirling, spinning and twirling,'' the town is transformed into a
winter wonderland both natural and magical. In a charming visual
aside, not acknowledged in the text, the only buildings of any
distinction in the town are its two bookstores, one of which plays
an important role in the transformation of the town from grim to
fantastical. With minimal text and engaging, colorful
illustrations, ``Snow'' is a picture book that young children in
all climates are likely to relish.

   THE PIRATE'S SON. By Geraldine McCaughrean. Scholastic. $16.95.
(Ages 8 to 12) The premise of this engaging novel is that Tamo
White was sent back to England in the early 17th century by his
dying pirate father to obtain a proper education. At school, Tamo
befriends the orphaned siblings Nathan and Maud Gull, and they set
off for Madagascar, which Tamo considers his home. They reach the
island, which appears ``like a gigantic crocodile asleep along the
horizon,'' and many thrilling adventures ensue.
</P>
<P>
   THE COBBLE STREET COUSINS: A Little Shopping. By Cynthia Rylant.
Illustrated by Wendy Anderson Halperin. Simon &AMP; Schuster. $14.
(Ages 7 to 10) A new series of books for girls features two
sisters, Rosie and Lily, and their cousin Tess, who lives with them
in a pretty house on Cobble Street. This episode is about making a
dollhouse that looks like Aunt Lucy's flower shop. The pencil and
watercolor illustrations are as sweet as the story.
</P>
<P>
   RAISING YODER'S BARN. By Jane Yolen. Illustrated by Bernie
Fuchs. Little, Brown. $15.95. (Ages 5 to 9) After an awful
midsummer fire that destroys much of a farm, the Amish community
calls on wise old Samuel Stulzfoot to oversee the planning and
raising of a new barn for the Yoder family. The story is told in
the marveling voice of an 8-year-old, Matthew Yoder. The lush oil
paintings move the narrative from many different perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   I WAS A TEENAGE FAIRY. By Francesca Lia Block. Joanna
Cotler/HarperCollins. $14.95. (Ages 12 and up) The author of the
``Weetzie Bat'' novels is an accomplished stylist whose vision of
Los Angeles is convincingly surreal. Barbie Marks, named for the
doll and treated like one by her mother, who wants a star, not a
daughter, has a secret friend: Mab, a proper Victorian-style fairy.
</P>
<P>
   CITY BY NUMBERS. Written and illustrated by Stephen T. Johnson.
Viking. $15.99. (All ages) Following the dazzling conceit of
``Alphabet City'' and continuing his love affair with New York, the
author has found and then painted numbers that spring from the very
fabric of urban life, from iron railings to shadows on a wall to
trash baskets aligned to make a figure 8. The numbers are more
difficult to read than the letters of ``Alphabet City,'' but
perhaps the stretching of vision for this companion book makes it a
grander and more complex achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ARLENE ALDA'S 1 2 3. Written and photographed by Arlene Alda.
Tricycle Press. $12.95. (Ages 2 and up) Another inspired counting
book, this collection of color photographs finds the shape of
numerals in surprising places -- an 8 in an open bagel smeared with
cream cheese, a 5 in the shadow of a bicycle. The author's charming
notes tell a lot about serendipity and artistic purpose -- some
photographs were planned, some first appeared when film was
developed, some just happened: ``I ate a banana. I saw a 3,'' she
writes, and shows us the peel: no doubt about it, it's a 3.
</P>
<P>
   TOILETS, TOASTERS &AMP; TELEPHONES. By Susan Goldman Rubin.
Illustrated with photographs and with illustrations by Elsa
Warnick. Browndeer/Harcourt Brace. $20. (Ages 8 to 12) The
household appliances we use are all the products of industrial
design, but they have evolved in curious and interesting ways. A
brisk, cheerful history of some of the objects we use most often
and how they came to the forms -- by no means always the obvious
ones -- in which we find them.
</P>
<P>
   THE COW OF NO COLOR: Riddle Stories and Justice Tales From
Around the World. By Nina Jaffe and Steve Zeitlin. Illustrated by
Whitney Sherman. Holt. $15.95. (Ages 8 to 12) Because complex
problems, like impeachment, reach the family dinner table, this
fine collection of folk tales underscoring differing cultural
values and ways of considering justice and punishment seems
particularly timely for families with school-age children. The
authors, who are both folklorists, offer extensive source notes and
an excellent bibliography.

 BOOKS IN BRIEF: CHILDREN
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The great political caricaturist and magazine artist Edward
Sorel has also illustrated children's books for years, and lately
he has taken to writing them as well. His latest collaboration with
himself, JOHNNY ON THE SPOT (Margaret K. McElderry, $16; ages 5 to
9), is an exciting yarn set in the old New York of radio serials,
when gangsters toted machine guns in violin cases. Sorel's vivid
and engaging illustrations include some big urban tableaus that
capture the romance and innocence of the era. The plot is just as
lively. When young Johnny's radio conks out during his favorite
program, he takes it to Dr. Zaga, the mysterious and eccentric
inventor (is there any other kind?) who lives downstairs. Dr. Zaga
zaps it with ``a small charge of electrostatic magnetism,'' which
causes the radio to broadcast not today's news but tomorrow's. This
allows Sorel to present, in quick, deft strokes, some of the usual
paradoxes and moral quandaries of time travel. Dr. Zaga tells
Johnny that they must not interfere with the future, but he does
not explain why, and in any event they do it anyhow, in various
ways. At first Johnny merely takes pictures of a bank robbery and
sells them to a newspaper, but soon he is rescuing a girl in a
burning building and hanging out at the race track, placing bets.
(``It's not gambling,'' Dr. Zaga explains to a reluctant Johnny.
``We know which horses will win.'')
</P>
<P>
   Some readers will want a little more rigor and consistency in
the ground rules, and some parents may find themselves concocting
explanations to fill in the gaps. The otherwise entertaining
overlay of science fiction on an already unfamiliar period piece
may also leave younger readers feeling a little baffled. One senses
that Sorel is writing about his own boyhood, when radios
represented the very limits of household technology. A mature adult
can read ``Johnny on the Spot'' in a home bursting and buzzing with
all manner of the latest circuitry and innovation, and be reminded
that there remains something singularly magical and otherworldly
about a voice on the radio. _ ADAM LIPTAK

   &UR; BEYOND THE MANGO TREE
</P>
<P>
   By Amy Bronwen Zemser.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwillow, $15. (Ages 10 and up) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An American child discovers the darkness in her own heart when
her father's job takes her to live in Liberia. Like the family in
Barbara Kingsolver's ``Poisonwood Bible,'' 12-year-old Sarina and
her parents bring their delusions with them to Africa. Sarina hates
it. She's trapped in an unhappy home in a foreign place. Dad's away
with his ``important'' work upcountry most of the time, and she
must care for her diabetic, madly possessive mother, who won't
allow Sarina to leave the yard. When Mom's in one of her frequent
insulin-deprived rages, she actually ties Sarina to a mango tree,
yelling, ``You are mine only, I cannot share you with anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The servants can't do anything to help Sarina; they would lose
their jobs. The housekeeper, Te Te, is like Sarina's guard: harsh,
rigid, unfeeling. Then Sarina makes a friend, Boima, a gentle,
lively local boy, whose torn, loose-hanging clothes barely cover
his fragile figure. He unties her. They climb and hide in the mango
tree. He tells her stories in his Liberian English dialect, and
sometimes she steals away with him to get a glimpse of the world
outside. But her mother has another source for her obsessive rage:
Who is stealing from the kitchen pantry? When Sarina discovers that
the thief is Te Te, who has been giving the food to Boima, Sarina
breaks with her friend, furiously jealous that he and Te Te had a
secret from her: ``He was my friend, not yours,'' she raves -- and
hears herself in her mother's voice.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of this astonishing story is in Sarina's
uncomfortable first-person, present-tense narrative, its intimacy
and its self-centeredness. The details of place and culture are
authentic (the author spent time in Liberia as a child in the
1980's) and so also is the privileged stranger's view of things. It
never occurs to Sarina to think about what the servants go home to
after work, why they need their jobs so desperately -- until, in a
heartbreaking climax, she discovers why Te Te has risked her job to
steal food. Like Sarina, for a long time we readers don't get it.
We are so caught up in Sarina's trouble and her adventures with
Boima that we don't see what she is describing right there before
our eyes. Far from generic exotic adventure, this is a powerful
contemporary story that shows the outsider the way things are. _

   &UR; WHEN VERA WAS SICK
</P>
<P>
   Written and illustrated by Vera Rosenberry.
</P>
<P>
   Holt, $15.95. (Ages 4 to 7) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An actor was showing illustrations from a wordless picture book
to his audience of preschoolers and encouraging their responses.
Now he was trying to quiet them with a story.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had spots all over her body,'' he read, ``even between her
toes and inside her ears.'' ``When Vera Was Sick,'' a kind of
measles memory by Vera Rosenberry, silenced the listeners. ``Vera's
mother put her in the spare room, away from everyone. The room was
quiet and dark. It was lonely and kind of scary.''
</P>
<P>
   The children seem to feel the little girl's misery and the
mother's worry. The ink and gouache illustrations are unusually
expressive. They are contemporary and sophisticated, but have the
character and directness of naive painting. Small details --
black-and-white linoleum, striped mattress ticking, floorboard wood
grain -- are evocative of home. The artist's strongest image is
also the story's most unexpected and satisfying character, the
``kitty'' -- a big, silky, stuffed pillow with arms. To the
children in the audience, the most arresting moment seems to come
when Vera, covered with spots, stands watching from the kitchen
doorway as her mother and older sister make gingerbread men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, what are you doing here?'' the sister shouts. ``YOU'RE
SICK!''
</P>
<P>
   Vera recovers, of course, and that is the end of the story. What
is surprising is that being sick and getting better, just this
alone, is such a compelling story. It's something we always knew,
adults say, yet something we might not have known so well without
this lovely book. _ JIM LATIMER

</P>
<P>
   Written and illustrated by Mitra Modaressi.
</P>
<P>
   DK Ink, $15.95. (Ages 5 to 9) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Parents easily grasp the basic rules of the ironically
reinterpreted fairy tale. Beautiful princesses aren't all they're
cracked up to be, and rampaging monsters are usually misunderstood
victims of class inequity. That such terrain may be more difficult
for children to negotiate isn't crucial to the genre's success; the
territory is a growing market niche, meant to awaken the jaded
sensibilities of modern parents too easily bored with recounting
the same old story over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Monster Stew,'' Mitra Modaressi tries to breathe new life
into ancient cultural tropes, reworking the classic texts of ``The
Princess and the Pea,'' ``Jack and the Beanstalk'' and that most
terrifying of all Grimm horror stories, ``Hansel and Gretel.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorgeously illustrated in a style happily luxuriating somewhere
between the Muppets and the Maurice Sendak of ``Where the Wild
Things Are,'' ``Monster Stew'' offers, pictorially, everything the
small child's mind desires: witches, monsters both cute and
fearsome and even princesses of various descriptions. But
textually, Modaressi is less successful -- by substituting frothy
irony (Jack's mother suggests the monster stay awhile after the
beanstalk is cut down because he's ``in no shape to travel
anyhow'') for the potent power of the original stories, ``Monster
Stew'' ends up tasting like watered-down myth. Parents may gently
smile; kids will wonder, ``What's the point?''
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that monsters, as a group, have been
unfairly slandered for generations. But to rectify this oppressive
history in Modaressi's title story, by inserting a pair of monster
fuzzballs in place of the human children Hansel and Gretel, wreaks
such havoc on the original narrative as to be ultimately
unsatisfactory. Gone is the wicked father who purposely abandons
his children. Gone, even, are the cages into which Hansel and
Gretel were thrown. Instead, we get a story with no sense of threat
or danger -- just two little monsters who eat a witch ``out of
house and home.'' An ironic twist, to be sure, but as with most
such literary exercises, the aftertaste doesn't last long enough. _

 BOOKS IN BRIEF: FICTION
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Riding on a train to Vienna in search of her runaway husband, a
Canadian art historian named Helen Martin enters a twilight world
of strange hallucinations, astounding coincidences and deadly
conundrums. Awakening in the middle of the night, Helen finds
herself sharing a compartment with an old woman named Rosa
Kovslovsky, who is somehow linked to her -- so closely linked that
Anna starts to believe her own body parts are being replaced by
Rosa's. Then this odd companion hands her a small box full of
wonders and clues, which will accompany Helen on a tour of Europe
in search of much more than her missing spouse. The box contains a
book on human anatomy, jewels and notes. And, in a nice twist, the
design of Barbara Hodgson's novel THE SENSUALIST (Chronicle,
$22.95) incorporates all these visual aids. As readers follow
Helen, we see the same images she is seeing: illustrated plates
from ancient anatomy texts, medicine vials, a pearl-studded picture
frame. Like the historical works she researches, Helen's box -- and
Hodgson's book -- provides a way of interweaving ``the significance
of the words with the importance of the pictures.'' Helen soon
finds herself embroiled in a historical mystery as printing blocks
from the works of the anatomist Vesalius seem to have resurfaced
long after they were reportedly destroyed in World War II. Helen's
husband was on their trail, and she quickly resumes his quest.
``The Sensualist'' is a quirky and intense novel, full of weird
events and oddball characters (a man who is interviewing every
person in the Vienna telephone directory; a doctor who is inspired
to become a train conductor when the conductor on his own train
drops dead) built around an investigation of the senses. The best
part is Hodgson's combination of pictures and text: as a physical
object, ``The Sensualist'' becomes an integral part of the plot,
guiding the reader as the complex narrative unravels. _ ERIK BURNS

   By Jaimee Wriston Colbert.

<P>
   Helicon Nine, paper, $12.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Rock Harbor, Me., is a rough-edged coastal town where much of
the economy centers on a maximum security prison. And in ``Climbing
the God Tree,'' a cycle of two dozen stories, the characters' lives
also have links to the prison. The first person we meet is Eli
Hyde, a 32-year-old painter who runs art therapy workshops for the
inmates while mourning a miscarriage that has all but ruined her
marriage to a handsome, increasingly cold-hearted carpenter. Soon
enough, we're introduced to Morton Salvitore, ``a lifer, different
from the others. . . . Hair the color of the prison wall, eyes flat
as a fish.'' He's been put away for murdering a girl named Jenna
Pierce -- and now he's obsessed with Eli. There are also
appearances by Jenna's mother, who's still bingeing on alcohol and
food to numb her pain 13 years after her daughter's sickening
death, and the Rev. Ellen Barnes, a formidable preacher bent on
guiding Morton to salvation. The scope of Jaimee Wriston Colbert's
storytelling is impressive, with no fewer than 16 central
characters delineated in intricately overlapping narratives. Yet
the plotting hinges on a string of tragic events -- a drowning in
the Atlantic, a rape, another miscarriage, a death from cancer, a
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease -- that too frequently shift the
focus from complex characters to less developed if more imperiled
ones. While the early stories stand on their own as sensitive and
unsentimental evocations of unrelieved loss, eventually the novel's
power is diffused by its own restless form. _ MEGAN HARLAN

   HarperSanFrancisco, $18. &LR;

<P>
   The author of 30 works of fiction and nonfiction, Frederick
Buechner is not only a well-regarded writer but also an ordained
Presbyterian minister. Drawing on both his literary and religious
credentials, he has used his latest novel to reinterpret ``The
Tempest'' by casting Shakespeare's drama as a contemporary tale of
redemption. The enchanted setting is Plantation Island in southern
Florida, where a successful writer named Kenzie Maxwell lives with
his wealthy third wife. Although he's about to turn 70, Kenzie is
still haunted by a 20-year-old scandal that occurred when he was
working in a South Bronx rescue mission -- and fathered a daughter
whose 17-year-old mother died in childbirth. Now, on the eve of a
gala birthday celebration, many of the figures from his past
reassemble, including the brother who betrayed him to the press,
the daughter he has never known and his wife's Ariel-like son.
There is, of course, a violent, potentially destructive storm; but
Buechner insures that all's well that ends well. _ RUTH COUGHLIN

   &UR; DARKNESS FALLS
</P>
<P>
   By John M. Del Vecchio.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's, $24.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In his latest book, John M. Del Vecchio (best known for the
Vietnam novel ``The 13th Valley'') explores the world of an unhappy
middle-aged advertising executive from a large Italian-American
family in Connecticut. Del Vecchio makes no secret of the fact that
his hero, Johnny Panuzio, plans to kill himself. Johnny's despised
but high-paying job may soon be eliminated. He feels rejected by
his wife, Julia; alienated from his teen-age son, Jason; and
frustrated in his attempts to take care of Rocco, his proud,
elderly father. But Johnny's problems move beyond the personal when
three of Jason's classmates are killed in a car accident and
Johnny's best friend's son -- handsome, a brilliant student and a
star of the soccer team -- is murdered. Tension builds as the
school and the town try to explain these deaths; in the process,
the precarious racial coexistence in this largely white suburb
starts to crumble. Johnny's still vivid childhood memories (which
punctuate the present-day action) only reactivate his youthful
insecurities, exacerbating his adult resentment and guilt. The
downward spiral of his life is convincingly horrific, and the
characters around him are realistically drawn. The only jarring
note appears in Johnny's melodramatic last thoughts, also spliced
in throughout the text. Despite this, the novel's ending achieves
an undeniable intensity -- although it would have been stronger if
Del Vecchio had jettisoned the spell-it-all-out epilogue and
14-page appendix. _ JOAN MOONEY

   &UR; RUDE BEHAVIOR
</P>
<P>
   By Dan Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleday, $24.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's been a very long time since those lovable bad boys Billy
Clyde Puckett and Shake Tiller led the New York Giants to the Super
Bowl, and now they're back. The question is, Do we really want
them? Once upon a time, they were amusing in a wacky,
take-no-prisoners sort of way; but in ``Rude Behavior,'' Dan
Jenkins's sporadically entertaining sequel to ``Semi-Tough'' and
``Life Its Ownself,'' the novelty is more or less over. This time
around, their antics wear pretty thin. Too old (and too beat up) to
make it onto the field himself, Billy Clyde is acting as point man
for his father-in-law, Big Ed Bookman, in his quest to set up a new
N.F.L. franchise in West Texas. Meanwhile, Shake has gone to
Hollywood to make movies that seem destined for the back end of a
double bill at the local drive-in. The supporting characters who
fill this somewhat forced satire are supposed to be colorful, but
for the most part they're downright tedious. Names like ReRun
Moses, Pluribus Uram, Fryer Pye, LaDaminion Walls and Budget Fowler
are meant to provide a chuckle -- but a wince is more likely.
Jenkins, who can write witty dialogue, obviously had fun coming up
with offbeat names for local watering holes (He's Not Here, Not
Tonight I've Got the Blues, Mommie's Trust Fund, the Gimmee Putt),
but he may be alone in that. And lines like ``Men were from two
channels at once, women were from Oprah'' fall shorter than a
quarterback sneak on a long fourth down. _ CHARLES SALZBERG

   Perhaps no one in our time has been able to capture the essence
of an individual's character in the snap of a shutter with as much
artistry as the French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson. With a
searching eye and an intuitive grasp of human psychology, he has
roamed the world over the last seven decades, recording the faces
of the unnamed and anonymous as well as some of the greatest
artists of the century. In TETE A TETE: Portraits by Henri
Cartier-Bresson (Bulfinch/Little, Brown, $65), he has selected some
of the most haunting and memorable images of his prolific career.
Here we see a portrait of a robed Matisse, looking like a pampered
pasha; a young, distracted-looking Jean-Paul Sartre, pipe at his
lips as he converses on the Pont des Arts in Paris; a pudgy-faced
Jean Genet, dragging on a cigar with an expression of amused
indulgence; and an aging Colette, flashing the camera a coquettish
glance. Included too is a trove of photographs that are among his
most legendary -- a stunning picture of Samuel Beckett looking more
hawk than human, a classic shot of the melancholy Alberto
Giacometti lost in thought and an electrifying picture of a hoary
Ezra Pound, his brow furrowed in barely suppressed fury. Marcel
Duchamp shares the camera frame with one of his ready-mades, an
expression of ironic detachment suffusing his face. A bare-chested
Picasso stands beside a tousled bed, unabashed in his frank
physicality. ``In whatever picture-story we try to do, we are bound
to arrive as intruders,'' Cartier-Bresson once wrote. Yet his great
gift is to take us inside the intimate encounter without creating a
feeling that we have trespassed. _ ANDREA BARNET

   &UR; TRULY BLESSED
</P>
<P>
   By Teddy Pendergrass and Patricia Romanowski.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam, $23.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The soul-music superstar Teddy Pendergrass's high-flying life
style ended abruptly on March 18, 1982, when his Rolls-Royce
crashed in Philadelphia, leaving him a quadriplegic. He awoke eight
days later, on his 32d birthday, to find himself strapped to a
large steel frame with a metal halo surgically attached to his
skull like ``some bizarre crucifixion,'' as he recalls in ``Truly
Blessed,'' a moving, at times harrowing, memoir. Pendergrass, who
started his recording career as the lead singer for Harold Melvin
and the Blue Notes with such seamless Philly soul classics as ``The
Love I Lost,'' and went on to become the first black male artist to
chart five consecutive platinum albums, found himself right back
where he started -- the hospital in which he was born, this time in
the spinal cord injury center. His story, written with Patricia
Romanowski, has the ragged edges and unresolved rage of reality:
``The road to recovery was more like the haunted house ride in a
boardwalk carnival.'' The book is both a richly textured history of
Pendergrass's musical roots in the creative explosion of 70's soul
that shaped his gruff, sexy style, and an unflinching look at what
it is like to be disabled. _ ERIC P. NASH

   &UR; THINKING WITH HISTORY
</P>
<P>
   Explorations in the Passage to Modernism.
</P>
<P>
   By Carl E. Schorske.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton University, $24.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Carl E. Schorske examines why he thinks we have abandoned
history; why, in this modern world, we think without history. For
Schorske, a professor emeritus of history at Princeton, the
decisive moment came in the 19th century when economic and
political changes proved so profound that the past appeared
increasingly irrelevant. One group of thinkers sought to restore
the importance of history by reforming modernity. Men like
Coleridge and Disraeli adopted a nostalgic historicism, a deep
longing to return to a golden age of social justice and harmony.
But in a clever analysis, Schorske illustrates how their own
sensibilities were shaped by modern reality; ironically, their
defense of the past belies how unbridgeable the gap between past
and present had become. Thus, their historicism was as useless as
the medieval finery adorning Victorian Gothic railway stations. In
contrast, modernists sought to wrest consciousness away from
history, the outmoded categories now impediments to the rich
possibilities created in the present. But they paid a price for
their originality -- they missed the coherence that a sense of
history brings to reality. Schorske, whose books include
``Fin-de-Siecle Vienna: Politics and Culture,'' illustrates the
efforts of modernist pioneers like Mahler and Freud to find new
categories of meaning, new foundations for thought. They, too, met
with disappointment; Schorske ends this subtle, important book with
an examination of Freud's reliance on the culture of ancient Egypt.
Even his retreat to within, the most successful response to this
new quest for meaning, required a grounding in history. _ DOUGLAS

   &UR; THE SECOND BRAIN
</P>

   The Scientific Basis of Gut Instinct and a Groundbreaking New
Understanding of Nervous Disorders of the Stomach and Intestine.
</P>
<P>
   By Michael D. Gershon.
</P>
<P>
   HarperCollins, $24. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``The bowel just is not the kind of organ that makes the pulse
race,'' Michael D. Gershon admits. ``No poet would ever write an
ode to the intestine.'' Nevertheless, in ``The Second Brain,''
Gershon makes a persuasive, impassioned and, at times, downright
lyrical case for the counterintuitive notion that ``there is a
brain in the bowel, however inappropriate that concept might seem
to be.'' Gershon, who is chairman of the department of anatomy and
cell biology at Columbia University's College of Physicians and
Surgeons at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center and one of the few
neurobiologists to turn his attention to the ``lowly gut and its
nervous system,'' recounts with considerable warmth, humor and
dramatic flair how he valiantly endured ``the slings and arrows of
outrageous colleagues'' who initially dismissed his then heretical
discovery that serotonin, already established as an important mood
regulator in the brain, also functions as a neurotransmitter in the
bowel -- where more than 95 percent of the body's supply of this
chemical is produced. Moreover, the bowel, with its hundred
million-plus nerve cells, is ``the only organ that contains an
intrinsic nervous system that is able to mediate reflexes in the
complete absence of input from the brain or spinal cord.'' The
fruits of Gershon's painstaking research eventually helped persuade
fellow neuroscientists, physicians and drug companies to entertain
the possibility that gastrointestinal disorders heretofore thought
to be triggered by psychoneuroses may actually be precipitated by a
``mental disease'' of this ``second brain.'' Although at times his
elaborately detailed descriptions of intestinal research
methodology may be daunting, much of the book succeeds in
presenting an often grim and complex topic in a surprisingly witty
and engaging manner -- as well as delivering hopeful news to the
estimated 20 percent of Americans suffering from functional bowel
disease. _ JACQUELINE BOONE

   &UR; THE HISTORY OF NORTH AMERICAN THEATER

   From Pre-Columbian Times to the Present.
</P>
<P>
   By Felicia Hardison Londre and Daniel J. Watermeier.
</P>
<P>
   Continuum, $95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The theaters of the indigenous cultures of North America and
Canada are usually overlooked in most survey books about
performance in the Americas. Felicia Hardison Londre, who teaches
theater at the University of Missouri, Kansas City, and Daniel J.
Watermeier, who teaches theater at the University of Toledo, are
the first to write a comprehensive history of North American
theater. Their study includes discussion of drama in Mexico, the
Caribbean, Canada and the United States from precolonial times to
the present. As with any survey, ``The History of North American
Theater'' inspires both admiration and frustration -- admiration
for the daunting research, frustration at the resulting
reductionism and the cursory discussions necessary to make vast
amounts of information manageable. At its best (which is most of
the time), the book offers clear and cogent information, well
organized and well presented; at its weakest it inundates the
reader with endless names and dates. ``The History of North
American Theater'' addresses a gap in the current literature,
although this impressive volume will probably best be appreciated
by theater students and scholars. _ BEVYA ROSTEN

 LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD IN THE RED LIGHT DISTRICT

   By Manlio Argueta.

 &UR; THE WOLVES ARE AT THE DOOR
</P>
<P>
   BY PATRICK MARKEE
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Political commitment . . . is seldom a calculated intellectual
strategy,'' the Salvadoran poet Claribel Alegria once observed.
``It seems to me more like a contagious disease -- and if you
happen to live in a plague area, the chances are excellent that you
will come down with it.'' For most of this century, Central America
has been rife with this plague, a contagion nurtured by brutal
poverty, United States-sponsored military dictatorships and the
violent suppression of popular uprisings. In El Salvador, several
great writers have been plague carriers: Alegria herself, the poet
Roque Dalton and the novelist Manlio Argueta.
</P>
<P>
   Argueta's second novel, ``Little Red Riding Hood in the Red
Light District,'' a kaleidoscopic tale of El Salvador in the
1970's, has finally been published in North America, in a lively
translation by Edward Waters Hood. In the United States, Argueta is
best known for his third novel, ``One Day of Life,'' an account of
a single day in the life of a peasant family in war-torn
Chalatenango. ``Little Red Riding Hood,'' the most popular of
Argueta's novels in his native land, was begun in 1972, abandoned,
then finally completed in 1978 in Costa Rica, where Argueta spent
most of two decades in exile.
</P>
<P>
   Through its fractured narrative, letter fragments and hyperbolic
lovers' dialogues, ``Little Red Riding Hood'' tells the story of
Alfonso, a student poet and would-be guerrilla soldier who carries
on a delirious affair with Hormiga, his landlady's niece, in the
Forest neighborhood of San Salvador. The ``red light district'' of
the title refers both to the poor barrio where Alfonso rents his
room and to the military-controlled regions of the countryside. At
his university, Alfonso joins a radical student union and works at
a clandestine press with several leftist friends.
</P>
<P>
   Intercut throughout the novel are glimpses of the ``Little Red
Riding Hood'' fairy tale, featuring Hormiga as the heroine and her
Aunt Gracia as Red Riding Hood's grandmother -- and not one but two
wolves. Unknown to Alfonso and his comrades, the clandestine press
has been infiltrated. Noel, a military intelligence agent, recruits
Guillermo, the working-class brother of one of the student rebels,
to spy on Alfonso. And when Alfonso decides to abandon the press
and join the forces of rebellion, the novel evokes not just these
wolves but those of El Salvador's past.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, though, the novel is haunted by the ghost of
Roque Dalton, who joined the armed struggle in the countryside. It
was Dalton's 1975 murder by a conservative faction of the People's
Revolutionary Army that inspired Argueta to return to the novel he
had abandoned. Dalton's own work forms the backdrop for the
fictional Alfonso's journey from poet to guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
   To most North Americans, for whom Central America was merely a
sort of provincial theater in the larger drama of the cold war, the
novel serves as a vivid reminder of the terror and hope of wartime
San Salvador. As in his first (as yet untranslated) novel, ``El
Valle de las Hamacas,'' Argueta uses this book lovingly to depict
the particulars of life in the poor districts of El Salvador in the
1970's: the sound of the clarinero bird, the scent of the
maquilishuat tree, the manic energy of the clandestine press, the
late nights drinking guaro liquor in a rundown cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you write a poem underground?'' Alfonso asks himself at
his darkest moment fighting in the countryside, and then provides
the answer to his own question: ``I'm below sea level, but my
sentiments -- that I express in some fashion -- are celestial.''
For Argueta, novelist of the urban poor, for the peasantry and for
the rural-urban migrants of war-ravaged El Salvador, that is the
answer too. True to the legacy of Roque Dalton, Argueta remains an
optimist.
</P>
<P>
   IN his introduction to Dalton's memoir of Miguel Marmol, the
leader of a failed uprising in 1932, Argueta quotes the historian
Thomas Anderson, who wrote that among all the nations of Latin
America El Salvador is ``a chronically unhappy country.'' ``But,''
Argueta argues, ``there is something more exceptional: that at a
high cost in lives, it has struggled to change the society of
horror, which has been equally exceptional. And it continues to
search for the social peace that has been unknown in its history.''
</P>
<P>
   Argueta's novel of poet-rebels, brother-traitors and young women
wandering in a forest of wolves is an invaluable memento of that
exceptional past.

 &UR; TEACHER'S PET
</P>
<P>
   BY SUZANNE BERNE
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   IN the best stories about families, one is invariably led to
agree with Willa Cather's remark that ``human relationships are the
tragic necessity of human life.'' Since they are the most necessary
of bonds, family relationships are also the most imperfect, which
is what makes writing about them so particularly challenging.
Within each family, as Cather notes, there are ``innumerable shades
of sweetness and anguish which make up the pattern of our lives day
by day.'' Capturing this daily complexity is exactly what Elizabeth
Strout accomplishes in her evocative first novel, ``Amy and
Isabelle,'' one of those rare, invigorating books that take an
apparently familiar world and peer into it with ruthless intimacy,
revealing a strange and startling place.
</P>
<P>
   The novel's main characters are Amy, a shy 16-year-old, chiefly
noticeable for her lovely blond hair, and her prim, anxiously
single mother, Isabelle, a secretary at the local mill in the small
New England town of Shirley Falls. Set sometime in the 1960's, much
of the action occurs during one stultifying summer, when the river
looks like ``a dead brown snake,'' the air smells sulfurous and
``carrots stopped growing when they were no bigger than the fingers
of a child.'' A few months earlier, a girl had been kidnapped from
another town, and she is still missing; a series of burglaries has
also unnerved Shirley Falls. This ominous summer finds Amy and
Isabelle working in the same office -- an intolerable situation for
both since they have, just recently, begun to hate each other.
</P>
<P>
   That they also painfully love and need each other is what gives
``Amy and Isabelle'' its absorbing tension. Marooned on the edge of
town since Amy's babyhood -- neither part of the Basin, the
working-class Roman Catholic community, nor part of WASP Oyster
Point -- they have shared a relationship of exclusive dependency
and muted depression. For Isabelle, ``life was moving forward the
way that lives did, and yet she was no more grounded than a bird
perched on a fence.'' Out of sheer loneliness, she has fallen in
love with her stodgy boss at the mill. Though she could befriend
other women in the office, Isabelle thinks they're beneath her. As
self-conscious as Isabelle, Amy has almost no friends either, no
consuming interests, and often nurses ``a vague and puzzling
feeling of shame.'' Her terrible secret is that for years she has
``wanted a different mother,'' someone who ``looked like mothers in
television ads.'' Devoted to their quiet yearnings, Amy and
Isabelle seem doomed to pine forever. But of course they do not.
</P>
<P>
   In the leisurely pace of a 19th-century novel, Strout describes
what becomes of Amy and Isabelle when something does finally happen
to them. It will not ruin any surprises to disclose that Amy falls
in love with her math teacher, Mr. Robertson, or that her
infatuation with him has seismic repercussions on her relationship
with her mother. What Isabelle does to Amy in return is savage and
yet horribly understandable -- an act of unmoored maternity that
illuminates the contradictions in her nature. Strout is likewise
skillful in making Mr. Robertson both loathsome and attractive, and
Amy poignantly ignorant while also poignantly perceptive.
</P>
<P>
   But the story's true drama lies in the palpable, intricate way
it examines the ``scrape of longing'' that drives these characters
toward human contact, leaving them raw and bleeding yet also more
fully alive. The physical world is always suggesting the romantic
one Amy and Isabelle ache for, and Strout wonderfully captures the
beauty and absurdity of this connection. Consider, for example,
this scene, in which Amy visits the A.&AMP;P.: ``The grocery store made
her want to cry: a strange hope and hopelessness collided here --
the hope of all those brightly lit kitchens out there with
telephones ringing on the wall, silverware clattering down on
tables, steam rising from pots on the stove, and then the
hopelessness of these rows and rows of canned beets and canned
corn.'' Similarly, as Isabelle drives by a farm at twilight, the
scent of mown grass fills her ``with some tremor that was almost
erotic, some confluence of different longings.''
</P>
<P>
   It's often these small occurrences, these glints of sweetness
and anguish, that lead Amy and Isabelle to expansive insights. When
Amy, awakening intellectually under Mr. Robertson's encouragement,
corrects her mother's pronunciation of Yeats, the humiliated
Isabelle decides to educate herself. First she tries reading
``Hamlet,'' which is beyond her, and then ``Madame Bovary,'' which
is not. Gripped by the novel, she experiences a devastating
understanding of ``the terrible longings Emma had.'' ``Madame
Bovary'' so unsettles Isabelle, in fact, that she decides ``she
might not read another book for a while, that life was difficult
enough without bringing someone else's sorrows to crash down about
your head.''
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, this is an unsophisticated way to read a book;
on the other, it is exactly the way the best books are meant to be
read. Strout is shrewd in selecting two great stories of family
betrayal for Isabelle's education because she is utterly unprepared
for Amy's rebellion, for ``the sense that her daughter was
strikingly different from what she had thought.''
</P>
<P>
   What awkward moments exist in ``Amy and Isabelle'' occur mostly
when Strout tries too hard to wrap up her story; suddenly a
narrative that has felt large and luminous is resolved into a tidy
parcel. She is also overfond of using parentheses to tuck in
extraneous details. But this is such an eloquent, captivating novel
that its occasional missteps don't much signify. By focusing on the
``confluence of different longings'' that bedevils her characters
into harming and helping one another, Strout makes the drab little
world of Shirley Falls seem richly important.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't blame these things on God,'' Isabelle reflects
toward the end of the book, ``It was people, just ordinary, regular
people, who did this to each other. People ruined other people's
lives.'' With this simple observation, she recalls us to our
purpose as readers and as human beings: to struggle to appreciate
the sorrows of others and perhaps reach a wiser sympathy for our
own.

 &UR; THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT STELLA
</P>
<P>
   BY LISA ZEIDNER
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Fresh air! Real people! A return to family values! Right-o. The
moment a character in a British novel craves country life, gleeful
readers know what to expect: the doddering, besotted aristocrats;
the grand old manor decaying; the local folk toothless perverts;
even the animals not pleasingly pastoral but randy and repulsive.
The parodic country idyll is so well entrenched as a genre in
Britain that a whole generation of prep school boys has memorized
the dialogue from the cult film ``Withnail &AMP; I,'' in which two
young London roommates, during their charming weekend away, do
things to a chicken that make the horse-head-in-the-bed scene from
``The Godfather'' look like a gentle training session on humane
animal treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Cusk's third novel, ``The Country Life,'' stands squarely
in this comic tradition. The risk was that the jokes wouldn't
translate to an American audience. But they do, handily. The first
of this novelist's books to be published here, ``The Country Life''
boasts pitch-perfect tonal control and humor of such sly subversion
that the novel's premise transcends mere skit.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine-year-old Stella Benson ditches her London life,
packs light and takes off for the tiny town of Hilltop, in Sussex.
There she is to help Piers and Pamela Madden of Franchise Farm care
for their disabled 17-year-old son, Martin. The last governess has
departed under mysterious circumstances. Stella herself, it
appears, has a secret in her past that she is eager to bury. ``I
just want to be left alone,'' Stella declares. ``Like a pair of
eyes in a jar.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's true, she has come to the wrong place. Stella finds
herself thrust into all of the tangled business of the fractious
Maddens. She also may or may not be privy to a plot by the locals
to expose the Maddens as the unscrupulous, licentious -- and
possibly homicidal -- tyrants they are.
</P>
<P>
   A reader is certainly inclined to feel sorry for Stella, who has
been given no advance on her salary, no food, no towels and no
definite idea of her duties, although her employers accuse her
almost at once of performing them poorly. ``My story so far could
be regarded,'' Stella confides, ``as a history of oppression, one
of those old-fashioned stories in which a poor, plain heroine
endures all the misfortunes that social and material disadvantage
can devise for her, but lives to be triumphantly rewarded at the
last moment for her forbearance.''
</P>
<P>
   But at around the point that Stella transforms her slacks into
foxy hot pants with the use of a pair of nail scissors -- before
she steals the booze or begins to chauffeur her paraplegic charge,
although she has no driver's license and in fact has never sat
behind the wheel of a car -- readers begin to suspect that she is
not exactly a stable woman. ``I stood on the brink of an abyss of
self-consciousness,'' Stella admits, ``a void into which I often
fall, rendering me unable, even over several hours, to dress
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Mary Poppins, in short. Although why a smart 17-year-old who
can wheel his chair himself and attends an exclusive academy (made
handicapped-accessible for him alone by his doting parents)
requires the full-time services of a governess is not quite clear.
Actually, it's clear what Martin wants to do with Stella. It's the
same thing that his dashing, cavalier older brother, Toby, wants to
do with her as soon as he sees her in the hot pants. It's the same
thing the Maddens' farm manager, Mr. Trimmer, wants to do with her,
though she has been warned that Mr. Trimmer's mama, with whom he
still lives, will brook no competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Because Stella's escapades are related in her own skittish,
stilted, often smashed, always highly unreliable voice, it's
frequently difficult to tell what's really happening. The Maddens
are either landed aristocracy of legitimate menace or fairly
ordinary if pretentious folk with a bit of family money to keep up
the Elizabethan rose garden. Nor can Stella give a coherent account
of the past that has led her to this point: ``The feeling that
one's own memories have become unfamiliar can give rise to the
suspicion that one's identity is malfunctioning and inefficient,
like a badly run office.''
</P>
<P>
   THE pleasure of ``The Country Life'' derives from how skillfully
Cusk draws us into ``the solipsistic cabbage patch'' of Stella's
consciousness. Like Alice in Wonderland, Stella often seems to have
critical scale problems. She can get inordinately bent out of shape
by a sunburn or a hangover. The end of the novel, however, finds
her stewed on Champagne, attempting to impale the family dog with
the tip of a picnic table umbrella. The novel's climax is sure to
offend anyone who gets sentimental about pets or considers suicide
a grave, existential matter.
</P>
<P>
   Cusk's Whitbread Prize-winning first book, ``Saving Agnes,'' was
an energetic dating novel, the type of which ``Bridget Jones's
Diary'' is the most visible recent example -- a genre featuring
hapless but not conventionally helpless young women looking for
love. ``The Country Life'' is an altogether stranger, more
sophisticated confection. Stella's love life is the very least of
her problems. For this delightful novel about the governess from
hell, maybe only the word ``wicked'' will do.

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

criticism from publishing houses.)

<P>
   Where some see an empty closet, second bedroom, or garage
apartment, others see a home office.
</P>
<P>
   But today's home work spaces don't have to be rooms dedicated to
computers, files and fax machines.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on needs and workloads, a ``home office'' can be
anything from an elaborate L-shaped desk to a rollaway computer
cart, or even a hide-the-goods armoire.
</P>
<P>
   With 40 million of us doing at least some of our work at home,
and increasing tax incentives for setting up space exclusively
devoted to business, homeowners are seeking creative solutions to
fashioning home offices.
</P>
<P>
   It's best to start with the fundamental question: Where?
</P>
<P>
   Will the office dominate an entire room? Or will you make do
with a small wall panel in the den or family room?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you have no space at all to set up a computer desk full
time.
</P>
<P>
   Consultant and author Candace Ord Manroe, who wrote ``The Home
Office'' (Reader's Digest, 1997, $23), says once you evaluate your
needs and have a clear idea of what you want, a space can always be
found. She's designed offices that have been tucked under
stairwells, in closets, attics and former pantries.
</P>
<P>
   Components exist to fit just about every need for a home office,
which at a minimum often means a personal computer, monitor, and a
printer/fax machine. The typical workstation has a hutch, a place
for a computer monitor, a pullout printer stand, a work surface,
file drawers and little nooks for paper.
</P>
<P>
   Rooms that have an open 7-by-7-foot corner can accommodate
elaborate L-shaped centers of that size, with plenty of room for
accessories like a printer table.
</P>
<P>
   ``The L-shaped and U-shaped desks are becoming more popular due
to space. The traditional executive type set up is just not
functional for the home,'' says Christina Erridge, public relations
manager of Staples Inc., the office-supply chain based near Boston.
``And people want more of a choice in fabrics, cabinet facings,
wood finishings. Not just the typical metal filing cabinets.
Something that complements their home and doesn't stick out.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2000, nearly 50 percent of homes will have some form of home
office, Erridge says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's tremendous growth. A lot of homes are now being built
with an office in mind,'' she says. ``Home offices are growing four
times as fast as any other kind of business, which is great for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary 30-by-60-inch computer desks and workstations can
fit into rooms where just one wall is available. For a standard
desk you would need a 6-foot wall space.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for L-shape centers can range from $199 to $800, while
desks and one-wall workstations are from $99 to $400.
</P>
<P>
   Most office furniture is made of laminated wood, and requires
assembly. If you'd rather someone else handle the screwdriver and
bolts, expect to pay an additional fee ranging from $35 to $125,
depending on the size of the unit.
</P>
<P>
   Desks and workstations are available in more than just
dark-stained wood, although that's still most common. Homeowners
can order hues from whitewash to cherry to match their decor.
</P>
<P>
   Armoires have become the fastest selling home-office components
on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Like entertainment centers, armoires allow owners to ``hide''
their computer behind closed doors when not in use. The armoire
then blends in with other furniture in the room, so the ``office''
literally closes up at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   If space is tight, the all-inclusive computer cart may be the
answer. Since it's on wheels, the computer can be rolled out for
work, then stashed away in a closet when done.
</P>
<P>
   Fitting into a space just 42-inches wide, the cart has space for
a computer, keyboard, monitor, printer and copy holder. It's a
popular option for a bedroom office.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for carts range from about $39 to $200, with a variety in
the $100 range. A matching hutch would cost about $50 more.
</P>
<P>
   Armoires and carts make even more sense these days as increasing
technology continues to shrink hardware. When home offices require
printers, copiers and fax machines, some companies have responded
with the ``all in one'' machine.
</P>
<P>
   These space savers combine a fax machine, printer, scanner,
copier, answering machine and telephone in a unit the size of a
typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Himowitz, who writes about his techno-addiction in
Fortune magazine, says his home office was greatly simplified by
the Concerto Switchboard, a $495 gadget from Centrepoint
Technologies that gives a home office the equivalent of a ``fancy
corporate phone system.'' It routes, screens or transfers calls,
coordinates the phone, fax and PC, and can even play music or
prerecorded messages while customers are on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Since one of the big advantages of home offices is comfort, make
sure furnishings provide ergonomic support.
</P>
<P>
   Use chairs that raise and lower pneumatically to match keyboard
height. Prices range from $20 for simple models to $400 for leather
desk chairs.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget inexpensive copy holders, mouse pads, wrist
pads, cord ducts or cable guides for hiding cords from view and
preventing tangling.
</P>
<P>
   Other items to consider are power strips with plug-ins for all
electronic equipment and a master switch to turn everything off at
once. They run about $50, with surge protectors built in.
</P>
<P>
   Functional desk lamps needn't be elaborate or expensive ($9 to
$60). Reading lamps with soft-white bulbs work well, regardless of
whether they're floor or desk models.

SHIFT GEARS...NOW!

<TEXT>
<P>
   Barry Wine graduated from Tufts University in the mid-'60s with
a degree in science. The following year he entered the University
of Chicago Law School. His academic success landed him a job with a
prestigious Wall Street firm; his future seemed set.
</P>
<P>
   Within a short time, Wine decided he would be happier pursuing a
simpler lifestyle. He and his wife moved to a small town near
Manhattan and he hung out his shingle.
</P>
<P>
   His love and study of nouvelle French cuisine prompted him to
fulfill a romantic dream. He opened The Quilted Giraffe, a pricey,
25-seat restaurant. One night, when the chef didn't make it to
work, Wine stepped into the kitchen. He has never practiced law
since.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I knew we wouldn't starve,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Quilted Giraffe has earned a four-star rating, more than
tripled in size, became world famous and provided a glamorous,
time-consuming career, Wine said.
</P>
<P>
   The story reads like an endorsement for the best selling
inspirational career guide, ``Do What You Love, The Money Will
Follow'' by Marsha Sinetar, California organizational psychologist
and author of the new book ``The Mentor's Spirit'' (St. Martin's
Press, $16.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are successful and fulfilled tend to be doing the
work they are suited for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But surveys show that, at best, only 25 percent of the work
force are clearly happy with their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, don't be discouraged if you haven't found your
niche.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Lore, a Maryland resident and author of ``The
Pathfinder: How to Choose or Change Your Career for a Lifetime of
Satisfaction and Success'' ( Fireside/Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1998, $14.)
said it frequently takes three jobs until the right career match is
found.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Musgrove, an Ohio licensed professional counselor for 30
years identifies two midlife points at which many people rethink
their careers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Between the ages of 28 to 32, those who feel that what they
are doing isn't right for them begin to realize that time is
ticking.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the mid-40s to early 50s, dissatisfied individuals address
the important questions of life with respect to their career and
overall contentment.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Sinetar says that the only way people, regardless
of age, can achieve personal harmony is to use their natural
talents, contribute to others, continue to grow and work in a way
that fits their personality, needs and desires.
</P>
<P>
   Changing to meet those criteria is no an easy task. There is no
guarantee of success. ``But if you want a guarantee, buy a
toaster,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Work feels good in any setting when the right match is made
between a persson's talents and the job requirements, experts
agree.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Ives, a graduate of New York University School of
Physical Education, loves going to work every day - at Ives and
Associates, her 19-year-old based executive search firm in
Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am definitely where I should have been all along. Business
keeps my mental juices flowing. I have taken some of my teaching
skills and applied them to a sales environment.''
</P>
<P>
   And she's financially successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a zoo, you want to have lions,'' Lore said. ``If
you have a business, you want to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much money you earn, however, it isn't worth it if
you don't find fulfillment career coaches say.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Arnold, 29, was on the fast track to financial success
before he left a sports marketing firm in Washington D.C. A few
years ago, he abandoned his goal of a master's in business
administration from a top school and decided to follow his dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that the salary was something competitive for me. I
did it to tell people I could earn six figures. Now I use that same
ambition for getting acting roles,'' said Arnold will appear in two
consecutive parts of the NBC show ``Homicide: Life on the Street.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lore's vernacular, what Arnold did was look into his personal
tool box of possibilities. Arnold decided that an acting career was
not a pipe dream, determined what he would have to do to get it
started and began to make the possibility a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think that chasing your personal star necessitates giving
up all convention.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Moskowitz, a Cleveland, Ohio psychotherapist and
artist, is represented by numerous galleries, has had shows in
several states and sells many of his works. He chose to piggy-back
his painting career on top of his medical profession when the
limits of managed care frustrated and diminished his satisfaction
in psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an extreme fantasy of moving to Santa Fe and living
above a studio gallery and seeing a few patients in
psychotherapy,'' he said. ``I call it an extreme fantasy because it
was partially rooted in fear. I was afraid I couldn't make enough
money to maintain the life my wife and kids were used to and that I
would be forced to cater to public tastes. That wouldn't be as
gratifying.''

SUPPLEMENT OF WONDER
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Here is the short list of facts about creatine, the athletic
supplement:
</P>
<P>
   It works.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a steroid.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone from talk show hosts to the salesman at your local
health food store is spouting off about the stuff (``Sure, take the
whole jar. That's why they make them big.'').
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kreide, associate professor at the University of
Memphis, is one of the country's foremost experts on creatine,
having conducted creatine supplementation studies of his own and
reviewed dozens of others. Equally important, Kreider was an
athlete before he was a scientist. ``Athletes should know the
facts,'' he said. ``Anyone who is thinking about taking creatine
should know what it is, what it does and what it doesn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   And so:
</P>
<P>
   Creatine is an amino acid, one of the twenty naturally occurring
amino acids that form protein molecules. Your body manufactures
creatine in the liver, pancreas and kidneys. Most people produce a
gram or two a day, about half your daily needs. By eating high
protein sources, you can get the rest through diet (a pound of beef
contains two grams of creatine; ditto for a pound of salmon).
</P>
<P>
   Protein's main job is to construct and repair tissue, so it's
not hard to see why protein comes in handy in exercise and sport,
activities that basically tear your muscles down and then rely on
you to repair them.
</P>
<P>
   But why, with a bunch of other amino acids involved in the job,
is creatine so important? As your body makes creatine, or as you
ingest it as food or a supplement, it's whisked through the blood
stream to your muscles, where it's converted to phosphocreatine, is
an important store of energy in the muscle cells.
</P>
<P>
   Creatine supplementation doesn't build muscle and power
directly. What it does is boost phosphocreatine levels in your
muscle cells. That allows you to work out more intensely. And that
translates to all of creatine's proven benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increased one-rep maximum lifting strength, improved vertical
jump performance, enhanced sprint performance in sprints lasting
six to thirty seconds, improved high-intensity performance in
events lasting ninety to three hundred seconds, an increase in the
total amount of exercise performed, increased total body mass and
an increase in fat-free mass,'' says Kreider. ``The science is
virtually indisputable.''
</P>
<P>
   In layman's terms, bigger, stronger, faster.
</P>
<P>
   And the effects can be dramatic. Research has shown that
creatine supplementation can increase strength from 5 to 15
percent. In studies, short-term supplementation, as little as a
week, added roughly a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of muscle to some
athletes' frames. Longer studies, two to twenty weeks of
supplementation, showed muscle gains as high as 5.5 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
   Side effects?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now there is no scientific evidence to suggest any
concern,'' says Kreider. ``To date the only side effect reported
from clinical studies on athletes, untrained people and hospital
patients is weight gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreider isn't the only one to give creatine a blemish-free bill
of health to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be irresponsible of me as a scientist to say that
there's absolutely nothing that could go wrong if you use creatine
supplements,'' says David Pearson, an exercise physiologist at Ball
State University in Indiana. ``But personally I have very little
concern about our athletes using them in controlled doses. Creatine
is a naturally occurring substance in food. If you were eating meat
you'd be getting creatine anyway. ''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if recreational athletes -- the weekend basketball player
who wants to recover faster, the 40-year-old weightlifter who
wouldn't mind a bit more muscle - could benefit from creatine,
Kreider gives them the green light, as long as they use the
supplement in a reasoned dose.
</P>
<P>
   But Pearson disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real benefits of creatine come from very, very intense
training,'' says Pearson. ``If you're just a jogger, a cyclist, a
swimmer or a three-day a week weightlifter who is training for
fitness benefit, don't mess with it. There is absolutely no
scientific evidence to support that creatine has a positive effect
on just the person who is working out for fitness reasons only.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson has a broader concern too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think creatine has been portrayed as much more important
than it really is,'' he says. ``Believe me, the changes that we see
with most individuals are less than dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creatine is not a quick fix for anybody's workout. It's a
supplement that appears to enhance strength and power under very
intense training conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other concerns shared by experts who aren't on a
supplement providers payroll.
</P>
<P>
   First, that those who use creatine don't abuse it. The typical
recommended - and scientifically proven safe -- ``loading'' regimen
for a 160-pound athlete (dosages vary slightly depending on the
athlete's weight) is a 5-gram dose four times a day for 5 to 7
days, then 3-5 grams of creatine each day after that to maintain
the muscles' elevated creatine content.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern, that those who do use creatine don't just go
out and buy the first, or cheapest, stuff they can get their hands
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be blunt,'' says Steven Plisk, director of sports
conditioning at Yale University and a certified strength and
conditioning specialist with the National Strength and Conditioning
Association. ``There's a lot of crap out there. Probably the most
insidious problem on the creatine market right now is the
counterfeit stuff that's coming in, especially from overseas. ''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, though Yale University won't supply creatine to
its athletes, Plisk makes sure he knows where the athletes are
getting it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the question of the long-term effects of
creatine use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lingering question is, `Is it safe?' and we will certainly
be researching that,'' says Kreider. ``But athletes have been using
creatine as a nutritional supplement for over ten years, and to my
knowledge there have been no serious problems. Certainly, more
long-term studies are needed. But right now there is no evidence
that creatine supplementation results in any adverse effects when
taken in recommended dosages.''
</P>
<P>
   Krieder and Plisk take creatine. Pearson does not.
</P>
<P>
   By this point, you may have already reached this decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to try it, fine,'' says Kreider. ``If you don't
want to try it, fine.''

CLEAR THE AIR WITH LIVING FILTERS
</HEADLINE>
  By TRACEY C. REMBERT 
 c.1999 ``E'' magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To lower stress, many physicians recommend a relaxing hobby like
gardening. But cultivating plants indoors may also lower the risk
of asthma, allergies and ``sick building syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency cites indoor air pollution
as one of the top five public health threats in America, and the
main culprit in the 60 percent rise in asthma over the last decade.
Now researchers are looking to houseplants for a solution to
polluted indoor air.
</P>
<P>
   The energy crisis of the 1970s led many Americans to
superinsulate their homes and offices against energy loss. Man-made
materials like particle board, synthetic fibers and plastic--which
emit harmful formaldehyde, trichloroethylene (TCE), benzene and
other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) over years of
exposure--have also become ubiquitous indoors. And while air
filters are adequate at capturing particles like dust and dander,
they do little to eliminate noxious VOCs.
</P>
<P>
   Though debates have raged for over a decade as to just how
effective houseplants are in improving indoor air, studies in
Europe and the U.S. have reported that particular plant species can
lower VOC levels.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, NASA senior research scientist Bill Wolverton tested
houseplants for their ability to maintain clean air for future
habitable lunar bases. Testing in sealed chambers, Wolverton found
that philodendrons and golden pothos were excellent formaldehyde
controllers; gerbera daisy and chrysanthemums were impressive
benzene purgers; pot mums and peace lilies were highly rated for
TCE removal.
</P>
<P>
   His initial findings suggested that one to three mature plants
were enough to improve the air in a 100-cubic-foot area. He also
found that it wasn't just plants doing the clean-up work, but the
microbes that were specific to the plants' roots.
</P>
<P>
   Wolverton's personal favorites are the lady palm, peace lily and
``Janet Craig'' dracaena--''because they're easy to grow, resist
insects and work wonders'' for a variety of pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   His latest book, ``How to Grow Fresh Air: Fifty Houseplants That
Purify Your Home or Office'' (Penguin Books, $15.95), additionally
lists the areca and bamboo palms, English ivy and rubber plant as
top pollutant controllers.
</P>
<P>
   But other researchers are unconvinced. For years, the EPA'S
Office of Indoor Air Quality has remained skeptical. ``Under a
tightly controlled situation, using plants may have some merit, but
people bring in contaminants when they enter a room,'' said Skip
Boat, who writes the office's newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Axelrad, former director of the EPA Indoor Air Division,
said NASA's studies did little to simulate the air changes of a
typical home or office. ``Our calculations indicate that a much
higher density of plants would be required (hundreds of plants in
the typical house) to achieve these results,'' writes Axelrad.

   ONE GOOD REMINDER
</P>
<P>
   When you dug into the Brie on the holiday table, did you wonder
whether it was OK to eat the rind? Some people just scoop out the
semisoft center. Others eat the cheese rind and all. Brie is aged
with the help of friendly bacteria called penicillium candidum,
which attach to the rind and encourage it to age
</P>
<P>
   from the outside in. The rinds are safe to eat, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ONE GOOD EXPLANATION
</P>
<P>
   What's the magic with chicken soup? It may just be the hot
fluids that soothe sufferers with colds. But Barbara Kafka, author
of Soup - A Way of Life (Artisan, $35), theorizes that chicken
soup's restorative reputation may be based on gelatin. Good chicken
soup requires good chicken stock. When you make your own stock from
chicken bones, gelatin (a body builder) is extracted from those
bones. If your stock comes from a can, you may be missing
something.
</P>
<P>
   Author casts light on healthy eating
</P>
<P>
   If the Jan. 1 resolution - and you know which one - is already
waning, get some inspiration from the new Light Basics Cookbook
(Morrow, $25). Martha Rose Shulman is a cookbook author known for
her Mexican Light, Provencal Light and Mediterranean Light books,
and she has a strong sense of flavor as well as an understated
commitment to lightening the food she sendsto the table. This one
targets beginning cooks.

 &HT;    Former schoolteacher prepares to hear case against Clinton
 &HT;    (ATTN: OHIO editors)
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When U.S. Rep. Steve Chabot made his living as a
lawyer, he was the legal equivalent of the family doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Advertised in the Yellow Pages, Chabot's one-man law office
handled cases across the legal spectrum from criminal defense to
divorce court. It was a mix of work Chabot categorizes under the
heading of ``whatever came in the door.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, Chabot's legal profile is about to rise. Just weeks
into his third term in Congress, this former elementary school
teacher is part of the team of prosecutors that on Thursday will
begin presenting a case for removing President Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   Chabot's role in the trial will be to outline for Senators the
definitions and dangers of perjury, one of the core charges against
Clinton. Chabot's presentation will not deal directly with the
evidence, though he may make reference to it, but rather he will
talk in general terms about the laws on perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll probably be talking for somewhere between 10
minutes and a half hour,'' Chabot said recently.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors, a group of 13 Republican members of the House
of Representatives, have 24 hours over several work days to make
the case against Clinton. Chabot said he expects to present his
piece of the case on the second day, although the schedule easily
could shift.
</P>
<P>
   Chabot is one of five members of the prosecution team that is
focusing on legal issues in preparation for the Senate trial. The
group includes U.S. Reps. Bill McCollum of Florida, George Gekas of
Pennsylvania, Bob Barr of Georgia and Chris Cannon of Utah. If the
White House makes any arguments on points of law, this group will
do the research to combat them.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Chabot's group is responsible for handling witnesses, if
they're called. The issue of whether to have live witnesses testify
remains a volatile one that the Senate, which dictates the rules of
the trial, has yet to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and the White House oppose calling witnesses because
they say it will needlessly lengthen a trail for which a voluminous
record of sworn testimony already exists. Republican prosecutors
say having witnesses appear before the Senate is essential to the
trial because it's the only way to let Senators evaluate their
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will settle the issue by voting later in the trial,
after both sides have presented their case. In the mean time,
Chabot's group is meeting ``usually more than one time in a day''
to discuss legal issues, and prepare a list of potential witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   If prosecutors are permitted to call witnesses, Chabot's group
will do the preliminary preparations, including interviews. Others
from the 13-member prosecution team would question the witnesses in
the Senate chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Chabot's coming performance in the impeachment trial should
signal the last phase of the long, pressure-filled task of judging
the president. Chabot is a member of the House Judiciary Committee
that began meeting last fall to review the Independent Counsel's
report on the extent to which Clinton sought to conceal his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   While some lawmakers have said they were belatedly struck by the
historical reality of what they were doing when they had to cast
votes on impeachment articles, Chabot said wearily, ``It always has
been very real to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been living and breathing this for months now.''

 &HT;    Film commission backtracks after featuring local school in drug
movie
 &HT;    By Ron Hayes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ While the students at Lake Worth High
School were being held to a strict ``Zero Tolerance'' anti-drug
policy last week, Palm Beach County's film commission was
unwittingly helping a low-budget film crew shoot a comic drug deal
in one of the school's bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Dave's Day Out begins when Dave buys some marijuana in the
bathroom. The scene was filmed Saturday with the cooperation of
both the school district and the county Film Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Did the county know the school would be used to film a drug
deal?
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't ask,'' writer-director Marlene Rogoff said.
``Nobody asked.''
</P>
<P>
   They should have. Even though the school will not be identified
in the film and the pot was fake, district policy allows the use of
school property only if the films don't ``contain scenes depicting
alcohol or drug usage.''
</P>
<P>
   Film Commissioner Chuck Elderd conceded Tuesday that his office
had not read the script before helping Rogoff gain access to the
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to request that any footage shot in conflict with
this policy be reshot on nonschool property,'' Elderd said.
</P>
<P>
   School District spokesman Nat Harrington was relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it's make-believe, it just makes it more difficult
for us to send a public message to young people that drugs are
wrong,'' Harrington said. ``Especially at school or anywhere near
school.''
</P>
<P>
   The feature film is not likely to be a blockbuster. Rogoff is
hoping to interest Blockbuster in a straight-to-video release.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a live-action Beavis &AMP; Butthead,'' Rogoff explained
Tuesday outside a Holiday Inn on Lake Worth Road, where filming
continued. ``The comedy is that they're oblivious.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave and his best friend, Fred, are ``only in search of the next
pleasure and girls, according to a press release touting the film.
Reality eventually catches up with them, but only after a fun-paced
twenty-four hours of misadventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the fight scene being shot Tuesday at the Holiday
Inn, teachers probably won't be recommending the Dave's Day Out,
which expects an R rating, even without the bathroom humor.
</P>
<P>
   When a leather-clad biker pulls a shotgun on Fred, Dave crowns
him with a concrete block.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got foul language galore, but no nudity,'' Rogoff said.
``They talk about it, but we don't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogoff is no stranger to local lovers of the cinema.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, she wrote and directed Scooter In Palm Beach, another
low-budget comedy that featured County Commissioner Carol Roberts
as a Palm Beach socialite.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner was so dazzled by her experience before the
cameras she persuaded the county to establish a film commission.
</P>
<P>
   She does not appear in Dave's Day Out.

 &HT;    Stupid PC signs contract to sell IBM equipment
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Stupid PC, the company trying to bring down-home
simplicity to home computer sales, is hoping to tap deeper into the
business market.
</P>
<P>
   The Norcross, Ga.-based PC retailer signed with the IBM Business
Partner program last week. The agreement lets the Po Folks of PC
sales peddle Big Blue's stuff, from Netfinity servers to ThinkPad
laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Stupid PC has also allied with Corporate Tele-Data, a South
Carolina company with an Marietta office, that will install the
servers and networks Stupid PC sells.
</P>
<P>
   This comes on the heels of a plan to open several retail stores
in five Southern cities.
</P>
<P>
   Stupid PC is on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, between 15 percent and 20 percent of the $4.3 million
in computers Stupid PC sold were to businesses. Most of that
business came from word of mouth, said Bart Brannon, president and
chief executive officer. The $4.3 million in revenue is up from
$3.5 million in sales in Stupid PC's first 12 months. Stupid PC
employs 18 people, most in offices off Peachtree Industrial
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Stupid PC was started in March 1997 over drinks at a Mexican
restaurant. The idea, Brannon said, was to make buying and setting
up a computer simple. Brannon tailored Stupid PC's business and
marketing plan accordingly. The company includes delivery and one
hour of instruction for each computer it sells. Promotional
material refers to processor speed as ``oomph.'' Stupid PC's Web
site refers to technical support as ``help with your 'puter.'' The
company's delivery and setup staff is known as ``the geeks.''
</P>
<P>
   But can a company that proudly dresses itself in overalls cater
to the blue-suit market?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our advertising seems to work with the business market as
well,'' said Brannon.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has no plans to change his marketing focus. ``At
least not a whole lot,'' he said. ``We've met with a marketing
company, and they seem to think we're on the right track. Maybe
we'll focus more on the geeks.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, Stupid PC completed its merger with World Net
Holdings. Stupid PC is traded on the OTC under the symbol STPX.
With the merger came about $600,000 from a London investment group,
Trident Trust Co. Stupid PC is using the investment and money from
stock sales to fuel expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that expansion will come in the form of retail stores,
which Brannon expects to cost about $50,000 each to open and
promote. The first opens in Marietta, off North Marietta Parkway,
the first week in February. A Charlotte store opens later next
month. Branches in Orlando and southeast Atlanta are expected by
May, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Next is electronic commerce. Brannon said Stupid PC's Web site
received 170,000 hits in December. Customers can order a computer
by e-mail or with a toll-free phone number. He hopes adding the
ability to buy a computer with a credit card from the company site
will entice some of the 170,000 visitors to stop browsing and start
buying. The electronic commerce option is expected to be available
by April, he said.

 &HT;    Company building a better Y2K trap
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Most PC software programs that test for Y2K problems
conduct limited searches. These explore only the computer's first
two layers, its real time clock and its BIOS, a chip in which basic
instructions have been hard wired.
</P>
<P>
   But most problems happen at the third level, in the operating
systems such as Windows or UNIX , claims Alpharetta, Ga.-based
Client/Server Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Their updated product tests all three layers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are unique things about our product, `Foundation/2000,
version 9,' '' said Alfred Nickles, president of the company.
``First, we test the operating system's application programming
interfaces, the path that programs use to access time and date
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do that in conjunction with testing the BIOS and the real
time clock. The issue here is, while individual pieces may be
compliant, the sum of the pieces may not be. There is no other test
product on the market that we are aware of that tests these
interfaces.''
</P>
<P>
   Competitors, though, aren't ready to acknowledge the Alpharetta
company has the better Y2K trap. ``There are a lot of products out
there and they all do things a little differently,'' said Suzanne
Sliter, spokesman for Centennial 2000 made by Centennial
International in Burlingame, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fix the BIOS with our product, and if the real time clock,
a hardware piece that can't be fixed using software, is OK, that's
all the fixing that's necessary,'' she said. ``The key is the BIOS.
You gotta fix the BIOS.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, it's important to obtain compliance statements from
application manufacturers. We provide all of this testing plus an
inventory of applications that can be used to obtain compliance
statements,'' Sliter said.
</P>
<P>
   Her company's product starts at $48 per PC and can be ordered at
650-373-2090.
</P>
<P>
   One of Client/Server Technologies' major customers doesn't agree
with Sliter's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there's a Year 2000 exposure that goes beyond
checking the BIOS and the real time clock, and this is the only
product we found that does that,'' said Jim Deffenbaugh, vice
president, technology, at Equifax. ``We've been real pleased with
the product and the level of support.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem: The Client/Server Technologies product tests for
Y2K and issues reports, but it doesn't fix the glitches.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded in 1993, employs 11 and has been in the
Year 2000 business since 1995. In addition to Equifax, clients
include BellSouth and several U.S. intelligence agencies, Nickles
said.
</P>
<P>
   Client/Server Technologies is located at 3050 Royal Blvd. S.,
Suite 180, Alpharetta, GA 30022.
</P>
<P>
   Companies can order the testing program at 770-360-6302, and
individuals can download it from the Internet (http://www.f2k.com).
The cost is $49.95.

 &HT;    Snow days are exciting...at first
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ On the first day school is canceled, it is all
joy and snowman-making and sled-riding. And guilty pleasure as the
routine of the work week fishtails like a Camaro on bald tires.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day, it is all joy and game-playing and
video-watching. Grandma and Grandpa are delighted to watch the kids
again. The boss is understanding when you can't make it in. The
older kids are thrilled to be home alone, impressed with their
newfound independence.
</P>
<P>
   On the third day, it is all joy and snowball fights and playing
with the Christmas presents, some of them for the first time. But
the grandparents have plans. The boss sounds a little less
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth day, you become alarmed when your 3-year old has
memorized the script of Here Come the Teletubbies , and chortles
through dinner, ``Who spilled the Tubby c-c-custard?''
</P>
<P>
   The 7-year-old becomes so adept at playing Clue you wonder if
he's headed for a career as a private investigator. Or a life of
crime.
</P>
<P>
   The lists to the older kids become as elaborate as a war room
map, beginning with ``Do not put the Tupperware in the oven'' and
building up to ``Do not feed the Godiva to the pet iguana.''
</P>
<P>
   In a level 1 cabin fever emergency, you're excited about running
out of diapers and having an excuse to run to Kroger's.
</P>
<P>
   On the fifth day, you're muttering things you never thought
you'd say: ``Back in our day, we never had snow days for an entire
week. Back in our day, they sure cleared the streets a lot
faster.'' Your third cousin, 15 times removed, agrees to watch the
kids for $100 a day.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-year-old invites a friend over, pleads demonic possession
_ ``I don't know what came over me'' _ when dismembered doll parts
are found all over the basement floor.
</P>
<P>
   On the sixth day, you start to envision a future in which little
Johnny, 15, is still in the third grade.
</P>
<P>
   In a level 2 cabin fever emergency, you drag out the lawn chairs
and watch the parade of snow plows.
</P>
<P>
   On the seventh day, sinister thoughts creep into your mind about
a conspiracy between the road department and the board of
education. No doubt they're all hunkered down at the Club Med in
Maui, enjoying a good laugh over their daiquiris.
</P>
<P>
   In a level 3 cabin fever emergency, an invitation to Chuck E.
Cheese's is gratefully accepted.
</P>
<P>
   On the 45th day, the boss turns the cafeteria into a child care
center; food fights break out.
</P>
<P>
   On the 153rd day, Dayton records its first June snowfall: 27
inches.
</P>
<P>
   On the 401st day the snow holds off, but a lone ice patch
cancels school . . . for the entire Miami Valley.
</P>
<P>
   On the 845th day President Dole declares a state of emergency .
. . for the entire state.
</P>
<P>
   On the 1,251st day, Johnny looks over his fourth-grade book list
and shaves for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   On the 3,453rd day, President Clinton pardons her husband for
the third time; Johnny gets drafted, but requests an educational
deferment.
</P>
<P>
   On the 6,521st day, potholes the size of the baseball stadium
cancel school for a month.
</P>
<P>
   On the 21,419th day, the rains come and never stop. A giant ark
is built and nervous cityfolk scramble to get on. Elderly first,
declares the mayor.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Swallowing a dog, choking on a flea
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Much has been made of the almost
unanimous support among blacks for President Clinton. The most
pious critics suggest that such support is an acceptance of lower
moral standards and a disregard for the level of decency and
integrity set forth in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest that such critics consider another possibility:
government-sanctioned social conditioning. The history of black
people in this country has taught most of us that, in governing,
Americans condone selective morality, the kind that can swallow a
dog but choke on a flea to preserve power.
</P>
<P>
   Even when discriminatory practices by our government are
confirmed beyond any doubt, the public demands no official
admission of guilt to declare that past actions will not be
tolerated in the future. Nor in such cases of abuse of power is
there public outrage that a moral message must be sent to America's
children. We have only to look at recent events to confirm this
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Department of Agriculture settled a
discrimination suit brought by black farmers. This case was filed
in 1997 after many years of futile protests and public
demonstrations. Farmers argued that since 1983, the department
systematically had denied them loans and subsidies routinely given
to white farmers. Many black farmers lost part or all of their land
as they sank deeper and deeper into debt.
</P>
<P>
   Even after discrimination had been documented, records show that
department officials lied and used every legal maneuver to obstruct
justice. That caused little public concern, then or now, with this
suit being expediently settled by consent decree to avoid giving
wider exposure to blatant discriminatory practices. The $375
million settlement cannot compensate fully what the farmers lost,
nor can it make up for the loss to America's farm culture of
countless black people who wanted just to earn a living through
sweat and toil on their own land.
</P>
<P>
   Probably, many black youths who have taken up careers in the
drug trade or otherwise abandoned efforts to remain within the
system are amused that the government is offering the black farmers
chump change by today's standards: a minimum of $50,000 tax free
and forgiveness of their debts to the Agriculture Department. Money
as a moral salve is not a remedy that can heal the debilitating
wounds of official bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   The cynicism of those who have lost all respect for law,
however, warrants less concern than the settlement's provision that
the department does not admit it discriminated against the farmers.
The department agrees only that its procedures in handling bias
cases were ``flawed,'' says civil rights director Rosalind Gray.
And, may I add, tolerance of little flaws to serve the ends of
power is the American way.
</P>
<P>
   Such tolerance of ethical compromise emboldens other officials,
without regard to the Constitution, to routinely apply selective
morality as it suits their purpose. Evidence can be found
throughout this country's history _ from treatment of Native
Americans to discrimination against peoples of color. Indeed,
tolerance of immorality to perpetuate power among those
traditionally in power has become so pervasive that our intrinsic
perceptions of right and wrong are skewed by our politics more than
by any other principles.
</P>
<P>
   Lying under oath, sworn or implied by the responsibilities of
office, and obstruction of legal justice are grievous offenses.
Unfortunately, our government never has declared them punishable
behavior worthy of expulsion from office. Our children know that.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of Mr. Clinton's impeachment trial
resulting from his reprehensible sexual behavior, children will
ultimately conclude, as most blacks have already concluded, that
our government demands adherence to a strict moral code _ but only
when that standard serves the purposes of those in power. National
integrity should be made of sterner stuff.

 &HT;    Replacing paddles with gavels
 &HT;    (ATTENTION, Georgia, Texas editors.)
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Children and teen-agers should be disciplined by
their parents and teachers, not the government.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder that the Supreme Court was openly skeptical of the
argument that a Georgia school system should be held liable under
federal law for failing to stop a male student from sexually
harassing a female student.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the support of feminist groups in behalf of the former
fifth-grader's efforts to extend Title IX's prohibition of sex
discrimination into elementary classrooms, Justice Stephen Breyer,
often identified as an anchor of the court's liberal wing, observed
that such a ruling ``would take that problem from educators and
psychologists and give that problem to lawyers and judges.''
</P>
<P>
   So little Johnnie taunts, teases and sexually harasses little
Susie. As a result, little Johnnie and a boatload of adults around
little Johnnie are hauled into federal court where the child's bad
behavior enriches lawyers and further clogs the nation's courts.
</P>
<P>
   The first time little Johnnie harasses little Susie he should be
hauled into the principal's office where his little fanny is
paddled. Then little Johnnie should be sent home with a note
describing his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, little Johnnie should be quaking in his Nikes.
The discipline he will receive from his parents will be far worse
than any punishment he would ever receive from his teachers or his
principal.
</P>
<P>
   With divine intervention his only hope to avoid his parents'
wrath, little Johnnie learns how to issue his first unprompted
heavenly petition.
</P>
<P>
   That's how children used to disciplined before the first
generation of parents in the 1960s rejected parental discipline as
fascist, authoritarian and destructive of their children's
creativity. That's when the inmates took over the asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of permissive parenting eventually merged with
fallout from the destruction of traditional nuclear families. The
result of skyrocketing divorce rates, single-parent homes,
dual-wage earner homes and permissive parenting has been
generations of undisciplined children.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than discipline children, the trend over the past several
decades has been to understand why children misbehave.
</P>
<P>
   School counselors and family therapists now attempt to do the
job abdicated by parents and educators.
</P>
<P>
   In large measure, the result has been children who refuse to
obey parents. With no assured punishment for disobeying firm,
consistent and fair rules, children know they don't have to do
anything they don't want to do. The only consequence of misbehavior
might be a chat with a counselor or a therapist.
</P>
<P>
   Having never learned the lessons of discipline from their
parents or teachers, many of these children grow into teen-agers
who see no reason to obey the law anymore than they obeyed their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, lawmakers are asked to enforce discipline and
punishment on children with tougher juvenile crime laws and
curfews. They also pass anti-gang laws and build juvenile boot
camps. Taxpayers pony up to build alternative schools and hire more
counselors for undisciplined children.
</P>
<P>
   As surrogate parents, lawmakers use the power of the state to
restrict the ability to juveniles to get tatoos, pierce their
bodies, smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, obtain a driver's license,
eat in restaurants where alcohol sales exceed food sales, play loud
music or sit anywhere in a vehicle without a seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Supreme Court is being asked to empower the federal
government's lawyers and bureaucrats to go into the nation's
elementary schools to ensure that little Johnnie doesn't sexually
harass little Susie.
</P>
<P>
   Little Johnnie's sexual harassment is inexcusable. But it should
be the job of Johnnie's parents and educators to teach him
discipline, not the federal government.

 &HT;    Class' wildlife at Bear Lakes eats up about $60 month
 &HT;    By Stephanie Desmon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Your eighth-grade science class probably
wasn't like Branden Hursey's.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there was a fish tank or a gerbil or two.
</P>
<P>
   But did you have anything like Pete the prairie dog, who burrows
under the courtyard? Or Ferris the emu, who sits atop 14 eggs which
could mean as many as 14 baby birds in the coming weeks? Or Floyd
the iguana, found sunning himself on the Bear Lakes Middle School
roof Tuesday morning?
</P>
<P>
   ``We get to feed them _ things like that _ get to know them
better,'' said Branden, who is often reminded of his favorite
television network. ``This is the closest we've got (to The
Discovery Channel) because we've got lizards and pythons and
emus.''
</P>
<P>
   The class is Ag Science _ a basic care and feeding of plants and
animals. The elective is taught by Charlie McDaniel, who started
the menagerie with the standard gerbils and rabbits five years ago.
The first emu was donated by a friend a year later and over the
years, more and more have been added to _ or born into _ McDaniel's
collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this class, we study all kinds of things that relate to
environmental horticulture and that's how everything fits
together,'' he explained. ``The animals are just part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are too many animals to count. Three emus, three iguanas,
several snakes and many chickens. Three furry white guinea pigs
were born this week, bringing the total to more than 30 guinea
pigs. A gerbil was born during first period Tuesday, a hairless,
sightless creature for now. Then there are the mice, which are
actually bred to feed to those snakes (another class lesson).
</P>
<P>
   This is the only class of its kind in the Palm Beach County
schools and officials support it, said district spokesman Nat
Harrington. Still, he said, they are working on a policy to govern
the use of animals in the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   The animals help keep the students in line, McDaniel said.
Behavior problems are next to nothing in Ag Science, partly because
his idea of punishment is: You can't feed the animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a real knack with (students),'' said Pam Witczak, a
special education teacher whose students also take McDaniel's
class. ``Children who have difficulty in other classes do really
well with him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's absolutely phenomenal,'' said Andrea Peppers,
Bear Lakes' principal. ``It's a one-of-a-kind program that does so
much for the children. . . . It has a calming effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the burden of taking care of the zoo falls on McDaniel,
who spends time on weekends and over holidays making sure they have
enough chow. The food costs about $60 a month, covered by
fund-raisers and supplemented by local nurseries who donate the
extra fruit some of the animals eat.
</P>
<P>
   Guinea pigs get oranges and grapefruit; iguanas get bananas.
Emus eat stuff that comes in a bag marked ``Emu Food.'' And Pete
the prairie dog eats everyone else's food.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest treat of all for the students could come next week,
when the first of Ferris' eggs are due to hatch (another lesson:
Male emus incubate the eggs, not the females). Emus are rarely born
out of the wild and though the last thing McDaniel needs is another
litter of animals, he's excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not even supposed to do this in captivity,'' he said.

 &HT;    HEALTH: Woman claims Caesarean's expense made doctor push
vaginal birth despite risk
 &HT;    By Cara Tanamachi
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For Michelle Ramirez, routine tasks like
mealtime have become daunting challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's youngest son, who turns 2 in April, cannot swallow,
hold up his head, speak or crawl. He has severe brain damage and
doctors say he might never learn to walk.
</P>
<P>
   He's fed through a tube inserted into his belly every four
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard,'' said Ramirez, 27, who lives in Austin. ``I pray
he'll learn to walk one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez filed a malpractice lawsuit against her doctor on Jan.
12, claiming that a vaginal childbirth, which caused her uterus to
rupture, led to her son's brain damage. Ramirez, like thousands of
women, had a Caesarean section with her first child 7 years ago. In
her lawsuit, she says she wasn't properly told of the dangers of
having a vaginal birth for her second child.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's doctor, Melanie Collins, could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's lawsuit is one of a growing number across the country
that claim cost-cutting pressures from the managed care insurance
industry are forcing hospitals and doctors to perform risky vaginal
births instead of Caesarean sections, which are often more
expensive procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago, the wisdom was once a Caesarean section,
always a Caesarean section, but there's been a movement away from
that fueled in large part by economics,'' said Les Weisbrod, an
attorney representing Ramirez. ``It costs two to three times more
to have a Caesarean section than to have a vaginal birth. This
cost-cutting mentality has become so pervasive, it has become a
medical standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, who has three children, was on Medicaid when she
underwent the birth of Isaac, her now 21-month-old son. Caesarean
sections cost on average about $6,000 for a hospital stay, versus
$1,800 for a vaginal birth, Weisbrod said.
</P>
<P>
   Called a VBAC for ``Vaginal Birth After Caesarean,'' the
procedure carries a risk because the scars from previous Caesareans
can increase the risk of uterine tears during birth, according to
Paul Fine, director of urogynecology at Baylor College of
Medicinein Houston. Such tears can rupture the placenta, blocking
the flow of blood and oxygen to the baby during birth, which can
lead to brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 years ago, new studies indicated that VBACs were not as
dangerous as once thought, which opened the door for their routine
use. Since then, the advice to have VBACs has become more common
and has led to a growing number of malpractice lawsuits, Fine said.
</P>
<P>
   Just how dangerous VBACs are is being debated among researchers,
with some experts saying such a risk of uterine tears is less than
1percent and others saying it is far greater.
</P>
<P>
   In Ramirez's lawsuit, filed by the Morgan and Weisbrod law firm
in Dallas, she claims her doctor did not move quickly enough to
perform a Caesarean, once it was clear Ramirez's uterus had
ruptured and the baby was in distress. She also says she was not
fully informed of the risk in having a vaginal birth after she had
had a Caesarean section for her first child.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac's father, Luis Vargas, said he hopes the lawsuit will
educate other potential parents about the risks involved in VBACs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want everybody to be informed, so the same thing doesn't
happen to them,'' he said.

 &HT;    When every day is Take Your Child to Work Day
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Anais Hernandez has a dream setup at
work, an arrangement that might inspire rabid jealousy in any
mother who worries about putting her baby in day care.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:30 a.m., Hernandez arrives at Dr. John H. Merey's office
with her 14-month-old daughter, Alondra. She puts the toddler into
a portable playpen behind the front desk and starts her day as
part-time receptionist at the eye surgeon's office in West Palm
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Alondra sits in the playpen, content to fiddle with her toys and
yammer a steady vowel movement of baby talk. Occasionally, she
pulls herself up to ogle the latest person standing at the front
desk. Patients take turns cooing at the doe-eyed girl as they pay
their bills or schedule another appointment with her mother.
</P>
<P>
   As if the situation couldn't be more ideal, Hernandez leaves at
1:30 p.m. to go to her second part-time job, this time handling the
billing for internist Dr. Jose Allongo. Another portable playpen
and a second batch of toys at the new office keeps the little girl
happy while mommy works until 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond saving money that she and her husband, Ramon, would
otherwise spend on day care, Hernandez has the comfort of enjoying
every moment of her daughter's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more important for her to have me around at this age than
when she's 3 years old,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   And Merey, who had the idea for Hernandez to bring Alondra to
work, gets to keep a valuable employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's more relaxed here with the baby than if she was here and
the baby was being watched by someone else,'' he says. ``I don't
see why more employers don't do this.''
</P>
<P>
   The kids-at-work concept is growing in popularity, labor experts
say. Some companies have found that employees _ who are spending
more time at the office and must juggle child-care arrangements _
are happier and more productive when the children are cared for
on-site. According to the National Childcare Survey, 12 million
children younger than 6, as well as 17 million school-age
youngsters, have their sole parent or both parents in the work
force.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, parents are flocking to family-friendly employers.
In its rankings of America's 100 best companies to work for,
Fortune magazine said 31 of those employers offer on-site child
care. Software developer SAS Institute in Cary, N.C., was ranked at
No. 4, mainly because it offers a 35-hour workweek, a child-care
facility that costs just $250 a month and a paid week off between
Christmas and New Year's _ when kids are out of school.
</P>
<P>
   Some employers, like NationsBank, try to help employees with
emergency child-care problems. NationsBank provides a child-care
subsidy to its lowest-paid workers who might not have alternatives
when school is out. Employees who earn less than $60,000 a year
receive a $35-a-week stipend. The banking giant also operates
child-care facilities at its main offices in Jacksonville, Fla. and
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   But bringing children to the office _ either on a temporary
basis or full-time _ still has many pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful in an emergency situation, such as when
the day care is closed one day or if the baby sitter is sick, but I
don't think it's the ideal situation,'' said Robin Hardman, a
spokeswoman for the Families and Work Institute in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, mothers who repeatedly bring children to the
office eventually bump into problems either keeping the child
content, keeping pace with the workload at hand or avoiding the
stigma from co-workers who assume they aren't focused enough on
their job.
</P>
<P>
   Hardman should know. When her son was born in 1996, she brought
him to the office three times a week for the first eight months.
Co-workers loved it so much, they adopted him as the office mascot.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we knew that once he started to crawl, it would be all
over,'' Hardman said. ``There is no way that I could childproof the
whole office. There were paper clips people dropped, all sorts of
things on the floor. Plus, it wasn't fair for him, to be stuck in a
swing with no one paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult to concentrate on her job and her child at the
same time, she said. Enough so that when her daughter was born five
months ago, she didn't consider bringing her to the office. ``It's
just not practical.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said she understands how rare her arrangement is. It
helps that she works in a small office with few co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   It also helps that she introduced Alondra to the office and the
playpen early on instead of waiting until she was 6 months old. The
little girl has always come to the office, so she is familiar with
the constant stream of visitors and acts as if she's at home.
</P>
<P>
   There are days when decorum breaks down into a crying jag.
Alondra is, after all, a toddler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I will let her cry and not pay attention to her,''
Hernandez said. ``It lasts 10, 15 minutes, tops.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Hernandez doesn't miss anything in her daughter's
life. That alone makes up for the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a baby sitter I could use,'' she said. ``But no one
takes care of her better than I do.'' Guidelines to let kids
whistle while you work
</P>
<P>
   If you take your child to work, it doesn't matter whether your
office is at home or in a corporate tower: You have to keep that
youngster entertained long enough to get some work done.
</P>
<P>
   Workplace experts pose these questions, which you should
consider before bringing a child into the workplace:
</P>
<P>
   Will your boss, co-workers and human resources department be
sympathetic?
</P>
<P>
   Do you work directly with the public or in a job where
interruptions can't be tolerated?
</P>
<P>
   Is your child old enough that she doesn't require frequent
attention? How long is his attention span? Are engaging activities
available, or will your child bother you because he or she is
bored?
</P>
<P>
   Is your workplace safe for children?
</P>
<P>
   Is a private place available where your child can be isolated,
should that become necessary?
</P>
<P>
   Could your child damage delicate equipment or merchandise?
</P>
<P>
   Is your child well-behaved and polite?
</P>
<P>
   Do you have the right toys at the office? Make sure they're
quiet, engaging and flexible enough that a kid can use them over
and over and not get bored. Construction toys such as Legos or
Tinkertoys are fine for school-age kids 5 and up. For younger
children, stick to a pack of paper and crayons. Older children will
enjoy storybook tapes and a cassette player with headphones.
</P>
<P>
   Have you established rules, such as no playing on the computer
or no touching the copying machine? Let them know what they can and
cannot do.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of break are you planning? Give them an escape from
the office near the middle of the day so the child will know this
won't last forever.

 &HT;    Snow days not so popular with Ohio school officials
 &HT;    (ATTENTION Ohio editors.)
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Local school officials can expect a chilly
reception if they go to the Ohio legislature seeking additional
snow days.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers who would have to approve any increase in the
number of calamity days granted school districts said Tuesday they
did not think an extension was likely.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio school districts are allotted five ``calamity days'' each
year. Several area districts, including Dayton, Trotwood-Madison,
Beavercreek and Tipp City, have missed seven days due to the recent
winter storms. Several others are also over the five-day limit,
including Vandalia-Butler, Kettering and Centerville with six.
</P>
<P>
   ``(An extension) would not be easy,'' said state Sen. Gene
Watts, R-Dublin. ``We would look at that very skeptically. We need
more school, not less.''
</P>
<P>
   Districts must have a contingency plan for how they will make up
the sixth to 10th calamity day if they exceed the five-day limit.
State lawmakers added that rule in the aftermath of ice storms and
a bitterly cold winter in 1995-96, when the legislature ended up
waiving minimum school year requirements to prevent classes in some
areas from extending into late June.
</P>
<P>
   Among big districts around Ohio, Cleveland and Akron have used
four days, Columbus has used three, and Cincinnati entered this
week having used two. Some school districts in northwestern Ohio
have used more than five calamity days, having lost time earlier to
fog.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said urban districts especially have a difficult time
pleading for additional calamity days because it is assumed cities
have the resources to clear the streets after a storm.
</P>
<P>
   If there are no more storms, schools will have to make up their
days, legislators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless something major pops, the answer is no,'' said state
Rep. Jim Buchy, R-Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton school officials said they have not talked about asking
for more days. They plan to add two days in June to make up for the
extra snow days, said district spokeswoman Jill Moberley.
</P>
<P>
   Tipp City Schools will not have to reschedule any days as long
as they do not miss any more because of the weather, said school
spokeswoman Kitty Lobo. The district had two extra class days built
into the schedule beyond the 178 required by state law.

 &HT;    Sleepy mailcarrier has much to answer for in upcoming court
appearance
 &HT;    (ATTENTION: Ohio editors)
 &HT;    By Wes Hills
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Maybe rain or sleet can't stop postal workers _
but what if they're tired?
</P>
<P>
   A former mail carrier has been charged with keeping and opening
30,383 letters and packages, including 208 parcels _ and
authorities are holding it all as evidence until the case is
closed.
</P>
<P>
   James S. Wynn, 54, faces a maximum of five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine, is charged in U.S. District Court in Dayton in a
bill of information. Bills of information are filed when defendants
agree to waive their right to first have their cases heard by grand
juries and agree to enter a plea.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn is scheduled to appear Friday before U.S. District Judge
Walter H. Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were tight-lipped about the mail contents, and
postal officials would only say Wynn's route was in West Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   One source close to the case, however, said it appears Wynn was
tired more than anything else and figured he could deliver certain
mail later. Doug Ervin, a postal inspector, said he will be able to
say more about the case after Wynn's court appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin did say that authorities found some Social Security checks
in the undelivered mail and the Social Security Administration has
been advised of the addresses on those checks.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, allowed the Social Security office to contact the
person ``directly and re-issue the checks to them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin said Wynn resigned ``shortly after he was confronted and
realized that the inspection service was aware of what he allegedly
had done.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the case is closed, Erwin said ``all efforts will be made
to deliver this mail to the rightful owners.''
</P>
<P>
   One source close to the probe said it appears Wynn primarily
didn't deliver junk mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Wynn) made sure the important stuff got delivered,'' the
source said. ``When he got behind on his route, he'd put the heavy
catalogs'' and other third-class mail in his home with the hope
``of getting to them later.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Erwin said he hopes the public understands that
wrongful conduct is involved in ``less than one-half of 1 percent''
of the mail delivery.
</P>
<P>
   When Wynn's case gets settled, however, is up in the air. His
Friday hearing may have to be postponed because his attorney is
preparing to resign from the case, according to Montgomery County
Prosecutor Matt Heck.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn selected assistant Montgomery County Prosecutor Carla Y.
Jones to represent him. But Heck said his assistants may not act as
a defense attorney in a local criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is absolutely not permitted by me,'' Heck said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Heck said Jones' father asked her to represent Wynn because he
was a friend of her family for several years. Heck said Jones took
the case without telling anyone in his office. But he said he did
tell federal prosecutors that she is a county prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is very apologetic,'' Heck said of Jones. ``She is
basically a young lawyer. She simply made a mistake.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes.)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or E-mail
him at q&AMP;(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt is back in the
news, can you refresh my memory: When and where was he shot, and
was the person who shot him ever caught?
</P>
<P>
   A: Flynt was shot by a sniper on March 6, 1978, near the
Gwinnett County Courthouse in Lawrenceville, Ga. Gene Reeves, an
attorney who helped defend Flynt against charges that he broke
Georgia's obscenity laws in Gwinnett County, also was wounded. On
the day of the shooting, Flynt and Reeves had eaten at a cafeteria
and as they walked back to court, they were struck by the sniper's
bullets. One pierced Flynt's spine and another cut through his
back, continuing through Reeves' arm and into his abdomen. The
trial was called off and the charges dropped. Flynt was left
paralyzed, but Reeves recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Joseph Paul Franklin, a self-proclaimed white
supremacist, confessed while in an Illinois jail for murder to the
Flynt shooting and other shootings, including the wounding of civil
rights leader Vernon Jordan. Franklin said he shot Flynt because
the pornographer published sexually explicit pictures of an
interracial couple. Franklin was indicted in 1983 in Flynt's
shooting, but Gwinnett prosecutors never brought him to trial
because he already was facing stiffer penalties in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Q: During the NBA strike negotiations, I heard frequent
references to the ``Larry Bird rule'' or the ``Larry Bird
exception.'' What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: That was the rule allowing a team to go over its salary cap
to sign one of its own players who became a free agent. It was so
named because Larry Bird with the Boston Celtics was one of the
first situations it came into play.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was said on a TV quiz show that there are eight time zones
in the United States, but we can count only seven. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are only six time zones in the United States. From the
east: Eastern, Central, Mountain, Pacific, Alaska and
Hawaii-Aleutian. Three other North American times zones (heading
east) are: Atlantic, Newfoundland and Greenland. But Newfoundland
might not be considered a true time zone because it differs from
its neighboring time zones by only a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who was the first secretary-general of the United Nations?
How many have there been since then, and will you list their names
and nationalities?
</P>
<P>
   A: Seven men have served as secretary-general: Trygve Lie of
Norway, 1946-53; Dag Hammarskjold of Sweden, 1953-61; U Thant of
Burma, 1961-71; Kurt Waldheim of Austria, 1972-81; Javier Perez de
Cuellar of Peru, 1982-91; Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt, 1992-96;
and, since Jan. 1, 1997, Kofi Annan of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Four men, educated and world travelers,were discussing the
origin of the expression ``a lion's share'' the other day, and each
had a different explanation. Can you clarify how it came about?
</P>
<P>
   A: A lion's share is the largest portion of anything, and
relates to the term ``leonine contract,'' which means a completely
one-sided agreement. According to the Facts on File Encyclopedia of
Word and Phrase Origins, the source of both is Aesop's fable about
the lion that hunted with several other animals, with the lion
claiming all the spoils of the hunt. One-quarter of the spoils he
claimed as king of beasts; a second quarter because he was braver
than any other animal; a third for his mate and cubs; ``and as for
the fourth, let him who will, dispute it with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the characters on the Taster's Choice TV
commercials? It was sort of a love triangle. Now I don't see them
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   A: The spots fell apart, rather like the complicated
relationships they portrayed. But they kept many viewers enthralled
for a long time. The ad campaign, launched in 1990, had 13
episodes, the last of which was shown in July 1997. It started when
a divorced woman, whose name was never disclosed, knocked on the
door of a neighbor, a single (and suave) gentleman identified as
Michael. She had wanted to borrow some coffee, and he introduced
her to Taster's Choice.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the woman's ex-husband, Andrew, came back into
her life, as did her grown son. Viewers were tantalized about how
it would turn out, but they won't ever know, because the
commercials ended without a climax. In the last one, the ex-husband
arrived to pick up the woman for a date. Michael was clearly
disturbed. The ex-husband was shown calling the next day to
apologize to the woman for creating the awkward scene. ``I'm sorry
about last night,'' he said. She interrupted with a mysterious
``I'm not.'' And that was the end.
</P>
<P>
   In print advertisements in October 1997, Taster's Choice invited
viewers/consumers to decide, through a poll, which man she should
pick. Michael won, but no later commercial ever dramatized the
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If the Atlanta Falcons should go to the Super Bowl in 2000,
when it's scheduled for the Georgia Dome, would the game site have
to be moved to another city?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. So it would be considered a ``home game,'' even though
most people in the Dome would be corporate execs and others from
all over.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recall that years ago, when I was in school, stamps cost 3
cents, and they stayed at that price for the longest time. Do you
know exactly how long?
</P>
<P>
   A: The per-ounce rate was 2 cents on July 1, 1885, said Barry
Ziehl of the U.S. Postal Service. It rose to 3 cents on Nov. 3,
1917, but went back to 2 cents on July 1, 1919. Then on July 6,
1932, it went back up to 3 cents, and didn't rise again (to 4
cents) until Aug. 1, 1958. Ziehl said he couldn't speculate on why
the rate was lowered between 1919 and 1932.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's often mentioned that Republican Rep. J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma is a former college football player. When was that? Did he
also play pro football? How old is he, and does he have a family?
</P>
<P>
   A: Indeed he did play pro ball _ in Canada. From 1981 to 1986,
Watts started for Ottawa and Toronto in the Canadian Football
League. Watts was voted the most valuable player of the Grey Cup
game _ the CFL's equivalent of the Super Bowl _ his rookie season,
said his spokeswoman, Tobi Edwards. Watts had been drafted by the
New York Jets as a running back, but he wanted to play the
quarterback position and went to Canada. Before his entrance into
elective office in 1990 as an Oklahoma State Corp. commissioner,
Watts was best known to many people as the University of Oklahoma
quarterback who led the Sooners to consecutive Big Eight
championships and Orange Bowl victories in 1979 and '80.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. (for Julius Caesar) Watts Jr. was born Nov. 18, 1957, in
Eufaula, Okla., the son of a Baptist minister and policeman who
also traded cattle. The junior Watts graduated from the University
of Oklahoma in 1981 with a B.A. in journalism. He won his seat in
Congress, representing Oklahoma's 4th District, in 1994, and was
re-elected in 1998 with 62 percent of the vote. He and his wife,
Frankie, have five children and live in Norman, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can we use our old 1-cent stamps along with remaining 32-cent
stamps for the new mailing rate, instead of buying the
undenominated supplement stamp that the post office is selling?
Like the new $20 bill, it looks like something somebody printed in
their cellar.
</P>
<P>
   A: You can use any combination of new or old stamps you like, so
long as they add up to 33 cents, said Postal Service spokeswoman
Sandra Harding in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the difference between Coca-Cola Co. and Coca-Cola
Enterprises?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're obviously closely entertwined. As explained in
Hoover's Handbook of American Business 1998, ``Guys in lab coats
and suits at the Coca-Cola Co. concoct the secret recipes and
blitz-market the brand, but Coca-Cola Enterprises does much of the
actual bottling and distribution of Coca-Cola products.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the more official explanation, from CCE's Web site
(http://www.cokecce.com): ``Coca-Cola Enterprises is the world's
largest marketer, producer and distributor of products of the
Coca-Cola Co. We also distribute Dr Pepper and several other
beverage brands in selected territories. We are an independent,
public company traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the
stock symbol CCE.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coca-Cola Co. (stock symbol KO) develops products,
produces the advertising and programs to support those products,
and sells syrup concentrate to Coca-Cola Enterprises and other
bottlers. As a bottler, we combine the product concentrate with
other ingredients to manufacture and package our beverages.
Coca-Cola Enterprises then uses its extensive sales and delivery
force to market and distribute products to retail customers and
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about a plagiarism case involving
authors Danielle Steel and Nora Roberts? What books were involved,
and what was the disposition of the case?
</P>
<P>
   A: Steel wasn't one of the parties. The copyright infringement
lawsuit that shook the world of romance writing down to its
throbbing heart was filed by Roberts in August 1997 against fellow
romance writer Janet Dailey. The suit was settled out of court last
year for an undisclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved two of Dailey's books, ``Aspen Gold'' (1991)
and ``Notorious'' (1996), both of which contained ideas and
passages that she admitted were lifted from works by Roberts.
Dailey said the plagiarism occurred at a time when her husband was
undergoing cancer surgery and she was under great stress. When
asked about the incident last year, Dailey's husband, Bill, told
The Associated Press: ``That's all behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   The plagiarism first came to light when it was posted on the
Internet by readers who cited comparisons between paragraphs in
novels by both writers. Initial reports about the lawsuit said
Roberts was asking Dailey to make a donation to the Literacy
Volunteers of America in lieu of damages, but it wasn't disclosed
if that came to pass in the settlement.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of 2.)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I recall that Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) started publicly calling
for President Clinton's impeachment almost immediately after the
president was elected for the first time. Can you refresh my memory
about the sequence of these events?
</P>
<P>
   A: Clinton was first elected president Nov. 3, 1992. He was
inaugurated Jan. 20, 1993. It was more than four years later _
March 1997 _ when Barr wrote a letter to Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.),
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, asking Hyde to consider
beginning an impeachment inquiry of Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent item in Q&AMP;A said bottled waters have had the
fluoride filtered out. Is the same true for those of us using
faucet filters? I've had a PUR water filter for some time, and when
I bought it, I was told it doesn't filter out fluoride. I want the
fluoride for my children's benefit.
</P>
<P>
   A: You're in good shape using a PUR filter. ``None of our
products take out the fluoride in the water,'' Q&AMP;A was told by Judy
Smith of PUR and Recovery Engineering, which makes the PUR drinking
water system. The PUR filter does claim to remove lead and
chlorine, as well as Crypto (Cryptosporidium) and Giardia bacteria.
For more information about what the filter does and does not
remove, call PUR consumer service at 1-800-787-5463 or
1-800-845-7873.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, while fluoride is removed from most bottled waters,
not all are fluoride-free. Gleda James, president of Lithia Springs
Water Co. in Georgia, says her firm's mineral water contains
natural fluoride in the amount of 1.7 milligrams per liter. Doe
information: 770-944-3880.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that ever since Elizabeth Dole became president of
the American Red Cross, contibutions have been down. Is this true?
Can you list the total annual contributions to the Red Cross from
the time she took over until now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although contributions haven't gone up every year under Dole,
they've shown an increase of $181 million over the eight-year
period, according to the American Red Cross. Dole, who became
president of the Red Cross in February 1991, announced recently
that she would step down, prompting speculation that she would be a
Republican candidate for the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions over Dole's eight-year period added up to $3.4
billion, of which more than $650 million was earmarked for disaster
relief, said Red Cross spokesman Bill Maddox. The year-by-year
amounts: 1991, $386 million; 1992, $394.7 million; 1993, $535.6
million; 1994, $504.7 million; 1995, $465.6 million; 1996, $474.4
million; 1997, $493.4 million; 1998, $566.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross is not a government organization, Maddox
pointed out, so it relies on contributions from the public,
businesses, corporations and foundations. During her tenure, Dole
initiated a complete redesign of the organization's fund-raising
practices and launched a new four-year fund-raising growth plan,
Maddox added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We would like to write to Larry Flynt, who is so much in the
news lately for his project to expose what he calls the hypocrisy
of some members of Congress. What is the address?
</P>
<P>
   A: The publisher of Hustler magazine can be contacted at: L.F.P.
Inc., 8484 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 900, Beverly Hills, CA 90211.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the address for the Council of Conservative Citizens,
the organization that Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) spoke to, igniting a
controversy because of its white supremacist views?
</P>
<P>
   A: Write: Council of Conservative Citizens, P.O. Box 221683, St.
Louis, MO 63122. While Barr admits having spoken to the group, he
disassociated himself from it after his appearance was publicized,
saying he initially wasn't aware of its extremist views. That point
was disputed by his critics, however, who maintain that the group's
reputation is well known.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Five women were just sworn in to statewide office in Arizona,
making it the first state to have an all-female elected line of
succession. What are their party affiliations?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gov. Jane Hull, Secretary of State Betsey Bayless, Treasurer
Caro-- Springer and Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa
Graham Keegan are Republicans; Attorney General Janet Napolitano is
a Democrat. Arizona doesn't have a lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting footnote: According to statistics compiled by the
Center for the American Woman and Politics at Rutgers University,
Arizona long has had one of the highest percentages in the nation
of women in state legislatures. This year's percentage: 36.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I get tickets to Super Bowl XXXIV in Atlanta next
January? How much will they cost?
</P>
<P>
   A: A limited number of tickets is made available to the public
through a lottery. To enter the lottery for the 2000 game, send a
certified letter with your request between March 1 and June 1 to:
Super Bowl Ticket Lottery, National Football League, 280 Park Ave.,
New York, NY 10017. Names will be drawn at random for the
opportunity to purchase tickets. A National Football League
spokesman said he expected ``about 5,000'' to be available next
year. Tickets for the Jan. 31 game in Miami are $325 each; the cost
for Atlanta's Super Bowl hasn't yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Often on ``Good Morning America,'' a group of people is shown
saying something like this: ``We are the teachers from the Atlanta
middle schools. Good morning, America!'' How can we do that?
</P>
<P>
   A: First, you need to be aware that a screening process is
involved, and potential subjects for ``GMA faces,'' as they're
called, are backed up for at least six months. But if you want to
try your luck, you need to contact the network's local affiliate,
said ABC publicist Dahlia Roemer in New York. If the local
affiliate determines by its screening that the proposed group is
suitable, if then forwards it to ``Good Morning America'' at ABC
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I haven't seen who will perform the national anthem at this
year's Super Bowl. Do you know?
</P>
<P>
   A: It will be sung by Cher.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent TV commercial for the Audi A6 showed a European city
square scene with a bride, a man on a bicycle, and a man and woman
embracing. The music, sung in a foreign language, was haunting.
Where was it filmed? Who performed the music, and what is the
language?
</P>
<P>
   A: The spot, part of a six-commercial campaign for Audi titled
``Heart,'' was filmed at the Royal Naval Academy in London, said
Joni Madison, head of broadcast production at the ad agency
McKinney &AMP; Silver in Raleigh. The music is a Bulgarian folk song
performed by Mystere de Voix Bulgares, the Bulgarian State Radio
and Television female choir. The particular number in question is
``Polegnala e Todora,'' a love song. The language, of course, is
Bulgarian.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read several items suggesting that Ted Turner might run
for president. Is that true? I would vote for him because he's got
scads of money, so he couldn't be bought by any special-interest
group, and his wife is no wallflower, so maybe he wouldn't get into
any sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's the official response from Turner Broadcasting
spokeswoman Caroline Harkleroad: ``We can confirm that in November,
The New Yorker magazine reported that Mr. Turner said he would like
to run for president. On several occasions in the past, he also has
talked about running, but he has never announced his candidacy. His
current focus is his work as vice chairman of Time Warner Inc. and
his dedication to the United Nations Foundation, the Turner
Foundation and other philanthropic endeavors.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does ESPN stand for?
</P>
<P>
   A: It doesn't stand for anything any more. But when ESPN started
in 1979, it was the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network
(thus, ESPN). However, the full name was dropped in February 1985
when the company adopted a new corporate name, ESPN Inc., and a new
logo. Based in Bristol, Conn., ESPN is 80 percent owned by ABC
Inc., which is an indirect subsidiary of The Walt Disney Co. The
Hearst Corp. holds the remaining 20 percent interest in ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What powers does a president have to grant pardons? Must
other government leaders be consulted? Can pardons be challenged?
How common are they?
</P>
<P>
   A: The presidential power to pardon is absolute. As it has been
interpreted by the courts, the pardon power is one of the few
constitutional powers of the president that does not require the
agreement of Congress or allow for congressional interference.
</P>
<P>
   A challenge is possible, however. Such was the case when
attorney George Murphy brought an action against President Ford
seeking a judicial declaration that Ford's pardon of ex-President
Nixon was unconstitutional. Chief Judge Noel Fox of the U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Michigan validated the
pardon, but took the unusual step of lambasting Ford's decision.
``Evidence now available suggests a strong probability that the
Nixon administration was conducting a covert assault on American
liberty and an insurrection and rebellion against constitutional
government itself,'' Fox declared.
</P>
<P>
   Pardons are not uncommon. President Washington used his pardon
power to help quell the Whiskey Rebellion, and Presidents
Washington, John Adams, Madison, Lincoln, Andrew Johnson and Carter
all have granted amnesties, the latter extended to Vietnam-era
draft evaders. President Bush issued controversial pardons to
several key figures implicated in the Iran-contra scandal during
the Reagan administration, and Nixon pardoned labor leader Jimmy
Hoffa. President Truman pardoned more than 1,500 people who had
violated the Secret Service Act during World War II, and President
Reagan issued nearly 400 pardons during his two terms.

an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or E-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: Since Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt is back in the
news, can you refresh my memory: When and where was he shot, and
was the person who shot him ever caught?
</P>
<P>
   A: Flynt was shot by a sniper on March 6, 1978, near the
Gwinnett County Courthouse in Lawrenceville, Ga. Gene Reeves, an
attorney who helped defend Flynt against charges that he broke
Georgia's obscenity laws in Gwinnett County, also was wounded. On
the day of the shooting, Flynt and Reeves had eaten at a cafeteria
and as they walked back to court, they were struck by the sniper's
bullets. One pierced Flynt's spine and another cut through his
back, continuing through Reeves' arm and into his abdomen. The
trial was called off and the charges dropped. Flynt was left
paralyzed, but Reeves recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Joseph Paul Franklin, a self-proclaimed white
supremacist, confessed while in an Illinois jail for murder to the
Flynt shooting and other shootings, including the wounding of civil
rights leader Vernon Jordan. Franklin said he shot Flynt because
the pornographer published sexually explicit pictures of an
interracial couple. Franklin was indicted in 1983 in Flynt's
shooting, but Gwinnett prosecutors never brought him to trial
because he already was facing stiffer penalties in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Q: During the NBA strike negotiations, I heard frequent
references to the ``Larry Bird rule'' or the ``Larry Bird
exception.'' What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: That was the rule allowing a team to go over its salary cap
to sign one of its own players who became a free agent. It was so
named because Larry Bird with the Boston Celtics was one of the
first situations it came into play.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was said on a TV quiz show that there are eight time zones
in the United States, but we can count only seven. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are only six time zones in the United States. From the
east: Eastern, Central, Mountain, Pacific, Alaska and
Hawaii-Aleutian. Three other North American times zones (heading
east) are: Atlantic, Newfoundland and Greenland. But Newfoundland
might not be considered a true time zone because it differs from
its neighboring time zones by only a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who was the first secretary-general of the United Nations?
How many have there been since then, and will you list their names
and nationalities?
</P>
<P>
   A: Seven men have served as secretary-general: Trygve Lie of
Norway, 1946-53; Dag Hammarskjold of Sweden, 1953-61; U Thant of
Burma, 1961-71; Kurt Waldheim of Austria, 1972-81; Javier Perez de
Cuellar of Peru, 1982-91; Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt, 1992-96;
and, since Jan. 1, 1997, Kofi Annan of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Four men, educated and world travelers,were discussing the
origin of the expression ``a lion's share'' the other day, and each
had a different explanation. Can you clarify how it came about?
</P>
<P>
   A: A lion's share is the largest portion of anything, and
relates to the term ``leonine contract,'' which means a completely
one-sided agreement. According to the Facts on File Encyclopedia of
Word and Phrase Origins, the source of both is Aesop's fable about
the lion that hunted with several other animals, with the lion
claiming all the spoils of the hunt. One-quarter of the spoils he
claimed as king of beasts; a second quarter because he was braver
than any other animal; a third for his mate and cubs; ``and as for
the fourth, let him who will, dispute it with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the characters on the Taster's Choice TV
commercials? It was sort of a love triangle. Now I don't see them
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   A: The spots fell apart, rather like the complicated
relationships they portrayed. But they kept many viewers enthralled
for a long time. The ad campaign, launched in 1990, had 13
episodes, the last of which was shown in July 1997. It started when
a divorced woman, whose name was never disclosed, knocked on the
door of a neighbor, a single (and suave) gentleman identified as
Michael. She had wanted to borrow some coffee, and he introduced
her to Taster's Choice.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the woman's ex-husband, Andrew, came back into
her life, as did her grown son. Viewers were tantalized about how
it would turn out, but they won't ever know, because the
commercials ended without a climax. In the last one, the ex-husband
arrived to pick up the woman for a date. Michael was clearly
disturbed. The ex-husband was shown calling the next day to
apologize to the woman for creating the awkward scene. ``I'm sorry
about last night,'' he said. She interrupted with a mysterious
``I'm not.'' And that was the end.
</P>
<P>
   In print advertisements in October 1997, Taster's Choice invited
viewers/consumers to decide, through a poll, which man she should
pick. Michael won, but no later commercial ever dramatized the
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If the Atlanta Falcons should go to the Super Bowl in 2000,
when it's scheduled for the Georgia Dome, would the game site have
to be moved to another city?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. So it would be considered a ``home game,'' even though
most people in the Dome would be corporate execs and others from
all over.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recall that years ago, when I was in school, stamps cost 3
cents, and they stayed at that price for the longest time. Do you
know exactly how long?
</P>
<P>
   A: The per-ounce rate was 2 cents on July 1, 1885, said Barry
Ziehl of the U.S. Postal Service. It rose to 3 cents on Nov. 3,
1917, but went back to 2 cents on July 1, 1919. Then on July 6,
1932, it went back up to 3 cents, and didn't rise again (to 4
cents) until Aug. 1, 1958. Ziehl said he couldn't speculate on why
the rate was lowered between 1919 and 1932.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's often mentioned that Republican Rep. J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma is a former college football player. When was that? Did he
also play pro football? How old is he, and does he have a family?
</P>
<P>
   A: Indeed he did play pro ball _ in Canada. From 1981 to 1986,
Watts started for Ottawa and Toronto in the Canadian Football
League. Watts was voted the most valuable player of the Grey Cup
game _ the CFL's equivalent of the Super Bowl _ his rookie season,
said his spokeswoman, Tobi Edwards. Watts had been drafted by the
New York Jets as a running back, but he wanted to play the
quarterback position and went to Canada. Before his entrance into
elective office in 1990 as an Oklahoma State Corp. commissioner,
Watts was best known to many people as the University of Oklahoma
quarterback who led the Sooners to consecutive Big Eight
championships and Orange Bowl victories in 1979 and '80.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. (for Julius Caesar) Watts Jr. was born Nov. 18, 1957, in
Eufaula, Okla., the son of a Baptist minister and policeman who
also traded cattle. The junior Watts graduated from the University
of Oklahoma in 1981 with a B.A. in journalism. He won his seat in
Congress, representing Oklahoma's 4th District, in 1994, and was
re-elected in 1998 with 62 percent of the vote. He and his wife,
Frankie, have five children and live in Norman, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can we use our old 1-cent stamps along with remaining 32-cent
stamps for the new mailing rate, instead of buying the
undenominated supplement stamp that the post office is selling?
Like the new $20 bill, it looks like something somebody printed in
their cellar.
</P>
<P>
   A: You can use any combination of new or old stamps you like, so
long as they add up to 33 cents, said Postal Service spokeswoman
Sandra Harding in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the difference between Coca-Cola Co. and Coca-Cola
Enterprises?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're obviously closely entertwined. As explained in
Hoover's Handbook of American Business 1998, ``Guys in lab coats
and suits at the Coca-Cola Co. concoct the secret recipes and
blitz-market the brand, but Coca-Cola Enterprises does much of the
actual bottling and distribution of Coca-Cola products.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the more official explanation, from CCE's Web site
(http://www.cokecce.com): ``Coca-Cola Enterprises is the world's
largest marketer, producer and distributor of products of the
Coca-Cola Co. We also distribute Dr Pepper and several other
beverage brands in selected territories. We are an independent,
public company traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the
stock symbol CCE.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coca-Cola Co. (stock symbol KO) develops products,
produces the advertising and programs to support those products,
and sells syrup concentrate to Coca-Cola Enterprises and other
bottlers. As a bottler, we combine the product concentrate with
other ingredients to manufacture and package our beverages.
Coca-Cola Enterprises then uses its extensive sales and delivery
force to market and distribute products to retail customers and
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about a plagiarism case involving
authors Danielle Steel and Nora Roberts? What books were involved,
and what was the disposition of the case?
</P>
<P>
   A: Steel wasn't one of the parties. The copyright infringement
lawsuit that shook the world of romance writing down to its
throbbing heart was filed by Roberts in August 1997 against fellow
romance writer Janet Dailey. The suit was settled out of court last
year for an undisclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved two of Dailey's books, ``Aspen Gold'' (1991)
and ``Notorious'' (1996), both of which contained ideas and
passages that she admitted were lifted from works by Roberts.
Dailey said the plagiarism occurred at a time when her husband was
undergoing cancer surgery and she was under great stress. When
asked about the incident last year, Dailey's husband, Bill, told
The Associated Press: ``That's all behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   The plagiarism first came to light when it was posted on the
Internet by readers who cited comparisons between paragraphs in
novels by both writers. Initial reports about the lawsuit said
Roberts was asking Dailey to make a donation to the Literacy
Volunteers of America in lieu of damages, but it wasn't disclosed
if that came to pass in the settlement.

 &HT;    Soup is a good food, and a warming one too
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Chicken soup may be the ultimate winter comfort
food, not just for those with a cold or flu, but for those weary of
the sight of ice ruts and the whirring sound of slipping tires.
</P>
<P>
   But soup can be as stimulating as it is soothing. With
imaginative seasonings, a bowl of soup can be an invitation to play
Let's Pretend.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine exploring the exotic markets in Morocco. Fantasize about
the beaches of Cancun or the eternal springtime of Oaxaca or San
Miguel. Indulge dreams of trekking through the temples of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, turn your back on the snow piled high outside.
Put on a pot of soup, steam up the windows and pretend you are
somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The quick-cooking soup pictured here uses the exotic flavors of
Moroccan cuisine to become a flavorful and filling meal in a bowl
that's ready in 15 to 20 minutes. The recipe is adapted from
Cooking to Beat the Clock by Sam Gugino (Chronicle, $16.95). Using
boneless skinless chicken thighs trimmed of fat really bumps up the
flavor. I wanted a dab of Harissa, the fiery Moroccan condiment
made from red peppers, to add excitement, although the recipe's
generous seasoning with cumin and ginger provides a flavorful base.
Look for Harissa at specialty stores specializing in Middle Eastern
foods.
</P>
<P>
   Because the emphasis is on speed, the author uses a food
processor to chop the onions. That's fine if you take care not to
overprocess the onion, which can quickly become a watery puree in
the machine.
</P>
<P>
   MOROCCAN CHICKEN SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 pound boneless skinless chicken thighs
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon hot paprika
</P>
<P>
   5 cups fat-free chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   2 medium zucchini
</P>
<P>
   cup couscous
</P>
<P>
   1 16-ounce can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
</P>
<P>
   salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   8 sprigs cilantro
</P>
<P>
   Harissa
</P>
<P>
   Put the oil in a deep, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Use
scissors to trim away any pockets of fat and cut the chicken into
inch cubes. Add to the skillet, raise heat to high and stir once or
twice while browning.
</P>
<P>
   While the chicken browns, peel and quarter the onion and put in
a food processor. Pulse until just chopped. Add the onion, cumin,
ginger and paprika to the skillet. Stir and cook for 1 minute. Add
the stock to the skillet and stir with a wooden spoon, scraping any
bits from the bottom. (Note: The soup can be made ahead to this
point and kept warm before proceeding.) Cover the soup and bring to
a boil.
</P>
<P>
   While the soup heats, trim the zucchini and slice in half
lengthwise. Cut crosswise into inch wide half-moons. When the soup
comes to a boil, add the zucchini and the couscous. Stir and add
the drained chickpeas. Cover and let the soup return to a boil,
then lower the heat so the soup simmers for 4 minutes. Season with
salt and pepper to taste. (The amount of salt depends on the
saltiness of the broth used. Start with teaspoon). Chop the leaves
from the cilantro and stir into the soup. Cook for 1 minute and
serve.
</P>
<P>
   Or substitute teaspoon sweet paparika and teaspoon cayenne.
</P>
<P>
   Harissa is available in tubes in some specialty and Middle
Eastern food stores.
</P>
<P>
   Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 425 calories, 11.9
g fat, 94 mg cholesterol, 1,218 mg sodium (amount will be lower if
chick peas are well rinsed).

 &HT;    Mitrovich sings as herself, not Joplin
 &HT;    (ATTENTION: OHIO, TEXAS editors.)
 &HT;    By Chris Riemenschneider
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There's a thin, awkward line between exploiting
dead rock legends and using their memories to create something
heartfelt, immediate and real. Andra Mitrovich felt relieved when
she learned that Big Brother and the Holding Company didn't want
her to cross that line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on an elevator with (Big Brother guitarist) Sam Andrew
after our rehearsal,'' the 31-year-old Austinite said last week,
remembering the night in December when she first joined the
legendary San Francisco band that helped launch Janis Joplin.
Mitrovich played Joplin in Zachary Scott Theatre's musical ``Love,
Janis.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued, ``Sam asked me, 'Andra, you didn't bring any
Janis garb, did you?' I said, 'No. To tell you the truth, I was
hoping to sing as Andra Mitrovich tonight and not Janis Joplin.' He
said, 'Good, that's exactly what we want.'''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake about it, Mitrovich and the founding members of
Big Brother and the Holding Company _ Andrew, Dave Getz and Peter
Albin _ have an adoration for Janis that Melissa Etheridge herself
could never quell (Etheridge was rumored to be portraying the Texas
icon in one of two upcoming film biographies). But when the band
members get together with the Austin performer for a series of
Texas gigs this month, none of them are interested in reincarnating
Joplin's musical ghost.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she had a good night, she sang as good as anyone in pop
music _ simple fact,'' Andrew said of Joplin, who got her musical
start as a folkie when she was briefly a student at the University
of Texas. ``But we are musicians, too. These tunes are fun to play,
and we think we actually say something new when we play them now.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing to remember about Big Brother and the Holding Company,
as well as many of the songs they still perform, is that they were
around before Joplin joined and after she left. The singer, who
died of an accidental heroin overdose in 1970 at the age of 27, was
only with the group for about two years before she and Andrew left
to form the Kozmic Blues Band. Even when she was with Big Brother,
Janis often lent the limelight to the other members, as evident in
the recently released ``Live at Winterland '68'' CD.
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovich, meanwhile, was a singer who happened to look and
sound like Janis, which led to a great opportunity to play the
troubled rock queen at Zachary Scott Theater. She went on to win a
B. Iden Payne Award for her performance last year. If anything, the
award showed that Mitrovich was portraying Joplin _ not trying to
be her.
</P>
<P>
   The two singers do share odd similarities, though. Mitrovich's
birthday is a day after Joplin's (Jan. 19). Mitrovich also grew up
in a refinery-laden Texas coastal town, LaMarque, much like
Joplin's native Port Arthur. And, said Mitrovich, ``I wasn't liked
by anybody at my high school, either.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mitrovich is quick to point out, ``I'm not a fanatic. I
don't have all the recordings. I don't go to the museums and try
and steal feathers from her boa. . . . I grew up listening to her
music and admiring her persona, just like so many other people.''
</P>
<P>
   The key similarity Andrew sees between the two singers is their
singularity. ``Believe me (Andra) has a big, big personality,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew first came across Mitrovich when he attended the opening
of ``Love, Janis'' in Austin in 1996. The two met after the show
and, later, at several other Janis-related functions. But it wasn't
until this fall, when another young woman singing with the band
opted out, that Andrew contacted Mitrovich about singing.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Janis' shadow set aside, few probably would have
guessed that Big Brother and the Holding Company would still be
playing together, almost 35 years after it became the house band at
the Avalon Ballroom in San Francisco and helped kick off the city's
revolutionary psychedelic era. When Joplin's star began shining
brightly after the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival and the release of
the ``Cheap Thrills'' album, the band was hit hard by critics who
said its musicianship was amateurish and that Joplin could do
better without the band _ words she eventually believed. Andrew,
who also left the band then but soon rejoined, said he and Janis
made a ``big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she would have been better off someday . . . but she
left too early, and so did I,'' he said. ``Full Tilt Boogie Band
was good and they were starting to build a solid friendship with
Janis when she died, but Janis never reached the same rapport with
another band that she reached with Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Brother continues to tour and record semi-regularly.
Following the Texas tour, which includes a stop at Port Arthur's
Janis Joplin Birthday Bash on Saturday, Mitrovich will prepare for
a spring run of ``Love, Janis'' in Cleveland. The Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame Museum in Cleveland is opening a new Joplin exhibit to
coincide with the production. Mitrovich hopes to hook up with the
band there, and anywhere else she can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt good about singing with the band when Peter
(Albin), their biggest skeptic, told me I worked well because I
don't fake Janis, I feel her, and I feel the music,'' she said.
``That's what it's all about.''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of 2.)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I recall that Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) started publicly calling
for President Clinton's impeachment almost immediately after the
president was elected for the first time. Can you refresh my memory
about the sequence of these events?
</P>
<P>
   A: Clinton was first elected president Nov. 3, 1992. He was
inaugurated Jan. 20, 1993. It was more than four years later _
March 1997 _ when Barr wrote a letter to Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.),
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, asking Hyde to consider
beginning an impeachment inquiry of Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent item in Q&AMP;A said bottled waters have had the
fluoride filtered out. Is the same true for those of us using
faucet filters? I've had a PUR water filter for some time, and when
I bought it, I was told it doesn't filter out fluoride. I want the
fluoride for my children's benefit.
</P>
<P>
   A: You're in good shape using a PUR filter. ``None of our
products take out the fluoride in the water,'' Q&AMP;A was told by Judy
Smith of PUR and Recovery Engineering, which makes the PUR drinking
water system. The PUR filter does claim to remove lead and
chlorine, as well as Crypto (Cryptosporidium) and Giardia bacteria.
For more information about what the filter does and does not
remove, call PUR consumer service at 1-800-787-5463 or
1-800-845-7873.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, while fluoride is removed from most bottled waters,
not all are fluoride-free. Gleda James, president of Lithia Springs
Water Co. in Georgia, says her firm's mineral water contains
natural fluoride in the amount of 1.7 milligrams per liter. Doe
information: 770-944-3880.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that ever since Elizabeth Dole became president of
the American Red Cross, contibutions have been down. Is this true?
Can you list the total annual contributions to the Red Cross from
the time she took over until now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although contributions haven't gone up every year under Dole,
they've shown an increase of $181 million over the eight-year
period, according to the American Red Cross. Dole, who became
president of the Red Cross in February 1991, announced recently
that she would step down, prompting speculation that she would be a
Republican candidate for the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions over Dole's eight-year period added up to $3.4
billion, of which more than $650 million was earmarked for disaster
relief, said Red Cross spokesman Bill Maddox. The year-by-year
amounts: 1991, $386 million; 1992, $394.7 million; 1993, $535.6
million; 1994, $504.7 million; 1995, $465.6 million; 1996, $474.4
million; 1997, $493.4 million; 1998, $566.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross is not a government organization, Maddox
pointed out, so it relies on contributions from the public,
businesses, corporations and foundations. During her tenure, Dole
initiated a complete redesign of the organization's fund-raising
practices and launched a new four-year fund-raising growth plan,
Maddox added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We would like to write to Larry Flynt, who is so much in the
news lately for his project to expose what he calls the hypocrisy
of some members of Congress. What is the address?
</P>
<P>
   A: The publisher of Hustler magazine can be contacted at: L.F.P.
Inc., 8484 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 900, Beverly Hills, CA 90211.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the address for the Council of Conservative Citizens,
the organization that Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) spoke to, igniting a
controversy because of its white supremacist views?
</P>
<P>
   A: Write: Council of Conservative Citizens, P.O. Box 221683, St.
Louis, MO 63122. While Barr admits having spoken to the group, he
disassociated himself from it after his appearance was publicized,
saying he initially wasn't aware of its extremist views. That point
was disputed by his critics, however, who maintain that the group's
reputation is well known.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Five women were just sworn in to statewide office in Arizona,
making it the first state to have an all-female elected line of
succession. What are their party affiliations?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gov. Jane Hull, Secretary of State Betsey Bayless, Treasurer
Caro-- Springer and Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa
Graham Keegan are Republicans; Attorney General Janet Napolitano is
a Democrat. Arizona doesn't have a lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting footnote: According to statistics compiled by the
Center for the American Woman and Politics at Rutgers University,
Arizona long has had one of the highest percentages in the nation
of women in state legislatures. This year's percentage: 36.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I get tickets to Super Bowl XXXIV in Atlanta next
January? How much will they cost?
</P>
<P>
   A: A limited number of tickets is made available to the public
through a lottery. To enter the lottery for the 2000 game, send a
certified letter with your request between March 1 and June 1 to:
Super Bowl Ticket Lottery, National Football League, 280 Park Ave.,
New York, NY 10017. Names will be drawn at random for the
opportunity to purchase tickets. A National Football League
spokesman said he expected ``about 5,000'' to be available next
year. Tickets for the Jan. 31 game in Miami are $325 each; the cost
for Atlanta's Super Bowl hasn't yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Often on ``Good Morning America,'' a group of people is shown
saying something like this: ``We are the teachers from the Atlanta
middle schools. Good morning, America!'' How can we do that?
</P>
<P>
   A: First, you need to be aware that a screening process is
involved, and potential subjects for ``GMA faces,'' as they're
called, are backed up for at least six months. But if you want to
try your luck, you need to contact the network's local affiliate,
said ABC publicist Dahlia Roemer in New York. If the local
affiliate determines by its screening that the proposed group is
suitable, if then forwards it to ``Good Morning America'' at ABC
headquarters.

<P>
   Q: I haven't seen who will perform the national anthem at this
year's Super Bowl. Do you know?
</P>
<P>
   A: It will be sung by Cher.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent TV commercial for the Audi A6 showed a European city
square scene with a bride, a man on a bicycle, and a man and woman
embracing. The music, sung in a foreign language, was haunting.
Where was it filmed? Who performed the music, and what is the
language?
</P>
<P>
   A: The spot, part of a six-commercial campaign for Audi titled
``Heart,'' was filmed at the Royal Naval Academy in London, said
Joni Madison, head of broadcast production at the ad agency
McKinney &AMP; Silver in Raleigh. The music is a Bulgarian folk song
performed by Mystere de Voix Bulgares, the Bulgarian State Radio
and Television female choir. The particular number in question is
``Polegnala e Todora,'' a love song. The language, of course, is
Bulgarian.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read several items suggesting that Ted Turner might run
for president. Is that true? I would vote for him because he's got
scads of money, so he couldn't be bought by any special-interest
group, and his wife is no wallflower, so maybe he wouldn't get into
any sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's the official response from Turner Broadcasting
spokeswoman Caroline Harkleroad: ``We can confirm that in November,
The New Yorker magazine reported that Mr. Turner said he would like
to run for president. On several occasions in the past, he also has
talked about running, but he has never announced his candidacy. His
current focus is his work as vice chairman of Time Warner Inc. and
his dedication to the United Nations Foundation, the Turner
Foundation and other philanthropic endeavors.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does ESPN stand for?
</P>
<P>
   A: It doesn't stand for anything any more. But when ESPN started
in 1979, it was the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network
(thus, ESPN). However, the full name was dropped in February 1985
when the company adopted a new corporate name, ESPN Inc., and a new
logo. Based in Bristol, Conn., ESPN is 80 percent owned by ABC
Inc., which is an indirect subsidiary of The Walt Disney Co. The
Hearst Corp. holds the remaining 20 percent interest in ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What powers does a president have to grant pardons? Must
other government leaders be consulted? Can pardons be challenged?
How common are they?
</P>
<P>
   A: The presidential power to pardon is absolute. As it has been
interpreted by the courts, the pardon power is one of the few
constitutional powers of the president that does not require the
agreement of Congress or allow for congressional interference.
</P>
<P>
   A challenge is possible, however. Such was the case when
attorney George Murphy brought an action against President Ford
seeking a judicial declaration that Ford's pardon of ex-President
Nixon was unconstitutional. Chief Judge Noel Fox of the U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Michigan validated the
pardon, but took the unusual step of lambasting Ford's decision.
``Evidence now available suggests a strong probability that the
Nixon administration was conducting a covert assault on American
liberty and an insurrection and rebellion against constitutional
government itself,'' Fox declared.
</P>
<P>
   Pardons are not uncommon. President Washington used his pardon
power to help quell the Whiskey Rebellion, and Presidents
Washington, John Adams, Madison, Lincoln, Andrew Johnson and Carter
all have granted amnesties, the latter extended to Vietnam-era
draft evaders. President Bush issued controversial pardons to
several key figures implicated in the Iran-contra scandal during
the Reagan administration, and Nixon pardoned labor leader Jimmy
Hoffa. President Truman pardoned more than 1,500 people who had
violated the Secret Service Act during World War II, and President
Reagan issued nearly 400 pardons during his two terms.

 &HT;    Versatility, effort define Vikings defensive tackle
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINTER PARK, Minn. _ Remember Keith Millard, the 1989 NFC
defensive player of the year? A ferocious, dominant defensive
lineman. A run-stopping, pass-rushing juggernaut. Well, Dennis
Green took over the Vikings in '92 and promptly traded him. It
seems there was a young, fearless terror who displayed the
potential to redefine the position and make everyone forget about
Millard.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, Green is still right. Millard's name has hardly
been raised in these frigid parts since, primarily because John
Randle fulfilled Green's prophecy. Make that exceeded the coach's
expectations. Surpassed anyone's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In the seasons since Millard was jettisoned, Randle has made the
Pro Bowl seven times. He has 86 sacks from '91-97 _ more than
anyone else. Keith who?
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of scared me at first,'' Randle said about the Millard
trade. ``I mean, I was supposed to replace Keith Millard, a guy who
did this and that. Coach Green told me not to be worried about all
that, (to) relax and play. Finally, I was able to just forget about
everything and just go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   He's played the best defensive line of anyone. And Randle has
been so dominating because he plays all over the line. He rushes
the quarterback from the left side and the right and the middle. He
rushes from a down stance and from an upright position. He stops
the run and attacks on the pass.
</P>
<P>
   And Randle attributes his ability to play various positions to,
of all things, basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to emulate basketball players,'' he said, ``a guy like
Michael Jordan or like Charles Barkley. I get my versatility from
watching a guy like Jordan. I'm able to line up on both sides. I
got my spin move from Charles Barkley. When you watch him play,
he's more likely to push you, push you and then spin off you to get
to the basket. I got those moves from watching basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching Randle work during practice and games is to witness the
ultimate, tireless competitor, his teammates say. That's really
what seems to separate Randle from others who are as physically
gifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy the game so much,'' he said. ``I just go out there and
just play as hard as I can. When I'm out there, I want to make the
most of it. I want to let everyone on the field know, `Hey I'm out
here, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's highly unlikely Randle goes unnoticed by anyone. Surely the
Falcons will doubleteam him during Sunday's NFC Championship game
at the Metrodome. His teammates notice how committed he is to
preparing himself and to performing at a high level.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see the kind of work he puts into it is amazing,''
defensive line mate Derrick Alexander said. ``I've learned to
appreciate it. It's uplifting to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone except the opposition. Green Bay's Brett Favre said
earlier this season: ``John is the toughest player I play. On
artificial turf, he's unblockable.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, the NFL blocked one of Randle's pregame rituals that
he's done for years. Some called it petty, others called it
ridiculous, but the league, in a harshly written letter, fined
Randle $10,000 and told him he could no longer line his face with
black paint on game days. It violated the NFL Uniform and Equipment
Rules. ``Specifically, you used black paint to cover your face,''
the letter said, although paint on the face was neither on his
uniform or equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just tried to find a way to stop me,'' he said, knowing
that it wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing that can stop Randle is, well, no one's
sure. Maybe injury. He's hampered with a knee problem this week,
suffered in the Arizona win Sunday, but no one among the Vikings
believes he would miss a game that decides who represents the NFC
in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, I'm pretty sure John'll be there,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Randle will start getting emotionally ready for Atlanta early
Sunday morning. ``My body is alive when I wake up on the day of a
game,'' he said. And he gets more excited as the day progresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if I play in Alaska or the middle of a desert,''
he said. ``Just give me 10 teammates and a chance to get to the
Super Bowl and I'll be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Randle, 31, had a tough but happy childhood in rural Hearne,
Texas. And it's a reason he's so relentless on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've chopped cotton, picked watermelons, built fences, worked
on an assembly line, worked in an oil field, built scaffolding,''
he said. ``You know what? Those jobs are harder than football. So,
I'll never take it easy in football.''

 &HT;    And that reminds me....
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Notes, quotes &AMP; winter coats . . .
</P>
<P>
   Unlike politicians, Michael Jordan is apparently going to ignore
the polls. I say apparently because I hold out hope.
</P>
<P>
   Eight NFL head coaches have been fired or left their jobs, and
none of them was named Bruce Coslet. I think I saw that movie once:
Against All Odds.
</P>
<P>
   Nice game of Musical Chairs the boys are playing, too. Ray
Rhodes, fired in Philadelphia, takes over in Green Bay. Andy Reid,
the Green Bay quarterback coach, replaces Rhodes in Philadelphia.
One man's trash is another man's treasure, and trash-versa.
</P>
<P>
   Two days into 1999, we had a frontrunner for Classless Act of
the Year: After his Dolphins beat Buffalo, Miami coach Jimmy
Johnson ripped up a box of Flutie Flakes and flung the cereal
across the locker room floor.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't know, Bills quarterback Doug Flutie's son was born
with autism, and profits from Flutie Flakes go to help people with
the disorder. Really hated to see Jimmy get drilled by Denver in
the next round, 38-3. Denver should have spread some of his
hairspray on its floor.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of full disclosure, I checked five names on my
Hall of Fame ballot: Nolan Ryan, George Brett, Tony Perez, Tommy
John and Jim Kaat. No Robin Yount. I didn't consider him
first-ballot worthy, although I would have voted for him next year
had he not made it.
</P>
<P>
   My Heisman ballot: 1. Ricky Williams of Texas; 2. Tim Couch of
Kentucky; 3. Donovan McNabb of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Since I've ripped Big Ten football _ deservedly _ these many
years, I must say now that the conference was the best in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes will miss David Boston more than Andy Katzenmoyer,
but they'll miss Joe Germaine more than either of them.
</P>
<P>
   If I'm the Browns, I trade that No. 1 pick and get a starter and
a No. 1 pick in return. Ricky Williams isn't going anywhere without
an offensive line and, as Jacksonville showed (with Mark Brunell),
expansion teams need mobile quarterbacks, of which Couch isn't one.
</P>
<P>
   Remember O.J. at Buffalo before they put together The Electric
Company?
</P>
<P>
   If I'm the Bengals, I'm looking real hard at offensive tackles
(BYU's John Tait, Georgia's Matt Stinchcomb or UCLA's Kris Farris).
Any or all of these guys might be an anchor who you put in the
lineup and then don't worry about for the next 12 years. The
Bengals blew it the last time this came up when they took Ki-Jana
Carter instead of tackle Tony Boselli.
</P>
<P>
   My four-team playoff after the bowl games would have been
Tennessee, Ohio State, Florida and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's national championship the year after Peyton Manning
left reminds me of a duplicate in college basketball. After Oscar
Robertson left Cincinnati (1960), the Bearcats won the next two
national championships.
</P>
<P>
   Fox-TV's ace play-by-play announcer, Pat Summerall, has
officially come to a point where he is as lost as Robinson Crusoe.
My favorite of his 317 miscalls or no-calls this season came in
October. Terrell Davis blasted at the goal line against the Eagles.
Half his body was clearly in the end zone. The officials on both
sides raised their arms. The entire Denver offensive line raised
its arms. Davis jumped up and exulted.
</P>
<P>
   Summerall, after 15 to 20 seconds: ``Well, the extra-point team
is coming on the field, so I guess it was a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Summerall is always the last to know. For his benefit, I
close with this: Hey, Pat, you're in Minneapolis this Sunday. Get
on your bike.

 &HT;    Grocery gendarmes squeal at bacon treat
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SNOOK, Texas _ Occasionally throughout history, a visionary
comes along who should be honored for his Herculean efforts in
swimming upstream against the tide of political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   Such a man is Frank Sodolak, who is pretty darned sure he
invented chicken-fried bacon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't never heard of it anywhere else,'' Sodolak said.
</P>
<P>
   Sodolak, owner of Sodolak's Original Country Inn in this small
town (population 489) about 13 miles southwest of College Station _
that's about 100 miles northeast of Austin _ serves the breaded and
deep-fried bacon as one of his appetizers. For that totally brown
meal, he says some people order it as an appetizer to go with their
chicken-fried steak.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what they're going to order,'' Sodolak said. He
concocted the high-in-vitamin-G (grease) food item eight or 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some bacon one time, and I was just fooling around to
see what would happen,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure Dr. Frankenstein said about the same thing when he
created the monster.
</P>
<P>
   Sodolak makes his chicken-fried bacon by double-dipping uncooked
bacon strips in milk and flour. Then he tosses the breaded strips
in a Fryolator and nukes them in animal/vegetable oil for three or
four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   For that final touch, the chicken-fried bacon is served with a
bowl of cream gravy.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it tastes pretty good. ``It's crisp, flaky, has a
distinct bacon flavor,'' said American-Statesman food editor Kitty
Crider, who sampled part of a to-go order. The stuff travels well
in the car. Hey. What's to go bad?
</P>
<P>
   But what I really like about Sodolak's concoction is that it
makes the food police crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard of anything worse,'' said Jayne Hurley,
senior nutritionist at the Center for Science in the Public
Interest in Washington D.C., the same bunch of food frumps who
warned us about theater popcorn, guacamole and Chinese food.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've taken fat, they've doubled-coated it in fat, they've
fried it in more fat, and then served it with a side order of
fat.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's her problem?
</P>
<P>
   At Sodolak's, you get six chicken-fried bacon strips for $3.50.
If you ate an order of this stuff every day for a year and you went
to the store in a pair of Capri pants, it would look like you were
keeping a sack full of gophers prisoner in your underwear.
</P>
<P>
   So how many calories are there in an order of chicken-fried
bacon?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no earthly idea,'' Sodolak said. His restaurant prides
itself in its ``Texas sized steaks,'' some of them up to 2 1/2
pounds. The restaurant T-shirt shows a fat cartoon guy patting his
stomach and saying, ``BURP . . . I Ate The Whole Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what the grocery gendarmes think, Sodolak says his
chicken-fried bacon sells pretty well. ``It runs in spurts,'' he
said. ``One night, we may sell five or six orders, another time 10
orders. Who knows?'' He says the firefighters from the firefighting
school at nearby Texas A&AMP;M love it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all comment on it; they've never seen nothing like it
before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There would be one way to improve it, however. ``The only thing
they're missing is a couple of fried eggs under the whole thing,''
said Hurley, the nutritionist.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a bad idea. That way they could serve it for
breakfast.

 &HT;    HEALTH: Woman claims Caesarean's expense made doctor push
vaginal birth despite risk
 &HT;    By Cara Tanamachi
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For Michelle Ramirez, routine tasks like
mealtime have become daunting challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's youngest son, who turns 2 in April, cannot swallow,
hold up his head, speak or crawl. He has severe brain damage and
doctors say he might never learn to walk.
</P>
<P>
   He's fed through a tube inserted into his belly every four
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard,'' said Ramirez, 27, who lives in Austin. ``I pray
he'll learn to walk one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez filed a malpractice lawsuit against her doctor on Jan.
12, claiming that a vaginal childbirth, which caused her uterus to
rupture, led to her son's brain damage. Ramirez, like thousands of
women, had a Caesarean section with her first child 7 years ago. In
her lawsuit, she says she wasn't properly told of the dangers of
having a vaginal birth for her second child.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's doctor, Melanie Collins, could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's lawsuit is one of a growing number across the country
that claim cost-cutting pressures from the managed care insurance
industry are forcing hospitals and doctors to perform risky vaginal
births instead of Caesarean sections, which are often more
expensive procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago, the wisdom was once a Caesarean section,
always a Caesarean section, but there's been a movement away from
that fueled in large part by economics,'' said Les Weisbrod, an
attorney representing Ramirez. ``It costs two to three times more
to have a Caesarean section than to have a vaginal birth. This
cost-cutting mentality has become so pervasive, it has become a
medical standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, who has three children, was on Medicaid when she
underwent the birth of Isaac, her now 21-month-old son. Caesarean
sections cost on average about $6,000 for a hospital stay, versus
$1,800 for a vaginal birth, Weisbrod said.
</P>
<P>
   Called a VBAC for ``Vaginal Birth After Caesarean,'' the
procedure carries a risk because the scars from previous Caesareans
can increase the risk of uterine tears during birth, according to
Paul Fine, director of urogynecology at Baylor College of
Medicinein Houston. Such tears can rupture the placenta, blocking
the flow of blood and oxygen to the baby during birth, which can
lead to brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 years ago, new studies indicated that VBACs were not as
dangerous as once thought, which opened the door for their routine
use. Since then, the advice to have VBACs has become more common
and has led to a growing number of malpractice lawsuits, Fine said.
</P>
<P>
   Just how dangerous VBACs are is being debated among researchers,
with some experts saying such a risk of uterine tears is less than
1percent and others saying it is far greater.
</P>
<P>
   In Ramirez's lawsuit, filed by the Morgan and Weisbrod law firm
in Dallas, she claims her doctor did not move quickly enough to
perform a Caesarean, once it was clear Ramirez's uterus had
ruptured and the baby was in distress. She also says she was not
fully informed of the risk in having a vaginal birth after she had
had a Caesarean section for her first child.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac's father, Luis Vargas, said he hopes the lawsuit will
educate other potential parents about the risks involved in VBACs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want everybody to be informed, so the same thing doesn't
happen to them,'' he said.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Norton utilities package goes a bit overboard
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After many a fanfare and rolling of the drums, the
computing public finally has Norton SystemWorks, a new package
apparently created because the venerable purveyor of utilities
succumbed to the siren call of introducing a product with a capital
letter in the middle of the name.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Norton Utilities, which have been recovering trashed
and damaged files for about as long as computers have been trashing
them, are here. Thrown in for good measure are a bunch of other
excellent utilities, such as Norton's AntiVirus, CleanSweep and
CrashGuard.
</P>
<P>
   If you install the entire program, you will have what amounts to
a silicon Chicken Little. You will be bombarded by colorful pop-up
messages warning you that WinDoctor has found errors in your
system. Rescue Disk will complain regularly that it needs to be
updated. LiveUpdate will pester you with urgent messages about
checking the Norton Web site for upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   Eudora Pro, my Internet mail program, never gives me any
trouble. But the first time I shut it down after installing
SystemWorks, CrashGuard leaped onto the screen, beating its hairy
chest and announcing it had saved me from disaster _ Eudora had
experienced 26 _ count 'em, 26 _ errors and was about to seize up.
</P>
<P>
   When I rebooted the computer for the first time after the
installation session, a Norton program came on and announced the
system hadn't been shut down correctly _ it had _ ran its own
version of Scandisk and found something on the order of 1,000
errors, most of which it corrected in less time than it takes to
tell you about it.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow this puts me in mind of those parking lot vampires who
disable your car when you aren't looking, then run up and
graciously offer to get you going again when it won't start.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I would never want to be without the Norton Utilities.
These are the best tools there are for recovering from accidental
or mistaken file and disk erasures and hard disk crashes. On the
other hand, I am not a computer hypochondriac; I don't want half a
dozen out-of-work neurologists, psychiatrists and proctologists up
to their elbows in my computer all day long, clucking and gasping
over the slightest blemish. Fortunately, there are ways of cutting
down on the communications.
</P>
<P>
   There is one problem in my system WinDoctor cannot, apparently,
solve _ a missing file needed by a Norton program already installed
on my computer. Evidently I'm going to have to uninstall this
program just to get Windoctor off my back about it.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting new part of Rescue Disk offers to create a more
elaborate and effective rescue setup on a 100-meg Zip disk if you
have an Iomega Zip drive. There's a second CD-ROM with the program
that throws in virtually everything else Norton publishes,
including Visual Page, a Web page creator; a basic edition of
WinFax; Norton's Mobile Essentials for laptop users; a utility
intended to bring you into the Year 2000 without disaster; and
something called ``Norton Secret Stuff.'' Hey, I can keep a secret.
</P>
<P>
   But just one suggestion. Why give up a title that stands forever
in anyone's top 10 software programs? If Peter Norton absolutely
had to give it a name with a capital letter in the middle, then why
not just plain NortonUtilities?

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Cold weather batters battery's health
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One victim of cold weather car killers is the battery.
</P>
<P>
   Has this ever happened to you? You go out to start your car in
the morning, after a subfreezing night, and hear either a sluggish
``grrrrr,'' a ``click click'' or nothing at all. What in the world
happened? Yesterday morning (a warmer day), the car started fine.
Now, without warning, the engine won't even attempt to turn over.
</P>
<P>
   Car batteries don't like cold weather. Batteries want to live in
temperatures around 80 degrees (don't we all?). At 80 degrees, a
fully charged battery will deliver 100 percent of its energy to
whatever electrical devices the car uses, including the starter. As
the temperature drops, so does the efficiency of the battery. In
fact, at 32 degrees, the battery is only about 80 percent
efficient. At zero degrees, available energy nose dives to around
50 percent. While even a partially charged battery may have enough
energy to start a car at 80 degrees, that same battery will fall
flat on its face when the temperature drops below freezing.
</P>
<P>
   The same cold conditions that cause the battery to become weaker
increase the engine's initial need for more electrical power. After
sitting overnight, the engine oil has a tendency to thicken. This
makes the engine harder for the starter to ``turn over.'' The
starter will try its hardest to accomplish the task, which means
using more electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have a vicious circle.
</P>
<P>
   The starter demands more electricity from a battery incapable of
delivering it. Consequently, ``click click.'' When you stop and
think about it, many of us drive around with partially charged
batteries, especially during the winter. If we drive short
distances with the accessories on (lights, wipers, defroster,
radio, etc.), we never give the battery a chance to fully recharge.
It actually takes about 20 minutes of continuous driving at around
2000 engine rpms to feed back to the battery the electricity used
for cranking.
</P>
<P>
   Because much of our commute time is spent idling at low engine
rpm, complete recharge is often never achieved. Of course, short
trips consisting of repeatedly starting the engine, driving a few
miles and shutting it off several times dig the fastest grave for
our little 12-volt friend.
</P>
<P>
   Short of overhauling your lifestyle, what can you do about it?
Make sure your battery is clean and the battery cables are clean
and tight (no green stuff growing on them). This ensures a clear
path for the electricity's travel. Take a long trip occasionally,
or at least make sure the engine is allowed to run continuously
about once a week for 20 minutes or so. (If you do this in the
driveway, don't turn on any accessories.)
</P>
<P>
   You might want to invest in a small, inexpensive battery charger
(2 to 5 amps). Hook it up to the battery overnight about once a
month.
</P>
<P>
   On nights it is going to be really cold, put your car to bed
with an old blanket thrown over the hood. Do this shortly after
you've shut the engine off. This will help keep some of the engine
heat under the hood and some of the cold out, which may help the
starting process in the morning. Most importantly, have your
battery checked and serviced as part of your annual winter
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Potential problems and marginal batteries can be caught and
attended to before they leave you stranded.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    CDs detail every inch of national parks
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Remember the ``Brady Bunch'' episode when Bobby and
Cindy got lost in the Grand Canyon on a family vacation and had to
eat baked beans out of a flashlight with an Indian boy?
</P>
<P>
   A National Park Digital Guide could have saved them the hassle.
Maptech, a New Hampshire and Massachusetts-based company, sells the
guides on CD-ROM for $29.50. Regional CD-ROMs, which come in sets
of two discs and have maps for eight to 13 parks, sell for $69.50.
The complete set of 54 parks is $179.50.
</P>
<P>
   The discs include topographic maps, which show elevation, and
information about park wildlife and history. The maps are
printable.
</P>
<P>
   Latitude, longitude and elevation are shown on the screen
automatically as you move your cursor. The interface is similar to
Microsoft Windows and works on a PC. You use a mouse or trackball
to draw your path on the on-screen map. Your charted course can be
printed, measured for distance, and viewed by elevation and
profile.
</P>
<P>
   The program requires Windows 95, Windows 98 or Windows NT; a 486
CPU or higher; 2X CD-ROM; 8 megabytes of RAM; and a mouse or a
drawing equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   The map CD-ROMs, a 1998 winner of Popular Science's Best of
What's New award, are available at http://www.maptech.com or

   Cereal killing
</P>
<P>
   The good folks at Cheerios are looking for four kids, ages
several months to 10 years, to be featured on a parenting advice
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The site, Growing Up With Cheerios, will offer child development
advice. The site also will include biographies of the four kids,
weekly progress reports and monthly articles written by child
development experts.
</P>
<P>
   Each kid chosen will get a $2,500 savings bond for his or her
college education and a year's supply of Cheerios, a popular
oat-based cereal.
</P>
<P>
   The kid search will be conducted online at the Cheerios site,
</P>
<P>
   http://www.cheerios.com. The site has information about the
Cheerios Kids program, a printable application form and
instructions for entering the search. Applications are due March 1.
The Growing Up With Cheerios site is to be launched in June.

   Save the tiger
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta-area software company is helping an international
effort to save the Sumatran tigers in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Sumatran Tiger Project are using satellite
image maps created with ERDAS IMAGINE geographic-imaging software.
Project members use the images to help field research teams map
Sumatran tiger habitats and identify threats.
</P>
<P>
   The Sumatran Tiger Project was started in 1995 by the Indonesian
Ministry of Forestry, the World Conservation Union, the Minnesota
Zoo and Taman Safari Indonesia to gather information on Sumatran
tiger ecology, population and threats. Members are developing
geographic imaging software that will let researchers analyze the
data collected during three years of field studies and use it to
develop conservation plans.
</P>
<P>
   ERDAS, a mapping software company, started helping with the
project in 1997. The company develops customizable software that is
used in more than 20,000 projects in 105 countries. The software is
used for oil, gas and mineral exploration; natural resources
management; urban and regional planning; environmental monitoring;
forestry; academia; engineering; telecommunications; utilities; and
map-making.

</P>
<P>
   Look at http://www.metaspy.com/spy/warningtop.html or, for those

   KIDS-AT-WORK _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The kids-at-work concept
is growing in popularity, labor experts say. Some companies have
found that employees _ who are spending more time at the office and
must juggle child-care arrangements _ are happier and more
productive when the children are cared for on-site. According to
the National Childcare Survey, 12 million children younger than 6,
as well as 17 million school-age youngsters, have their sole parent
or both parents in the work force. As a result, parents are

might never learn to walk. He's fed through a tube inserted into
his belly every four hours. ``It's hard,'' said Ramirez, 27, who
lives in Austin. ``I pray he'll learn to walk one day.'' Ramirez
filed a malpractice lawsuit against her doctor on Jan. 12, claiming

   KIDS-AT-WORK _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The kids-at-work concept
is growing in popularity, labor experts say. Some companies have
found that employees _ who are spending more time at the office and
must juggle child-care arrangements _ are happier and more
productive when the children are cared for on-site. According to
the National Childcare Survey, 12 million children younger than 6,
as well as 17 million school-age youngsters, have their sole parent
or both parents in the work force. As a result, parents are
flocking to family-friendly employers. (Houck, Palm Beach ) MOVED.

   CAESAREAN-SUIT _ AUSTIN, Texas _ For Michelle Ramirez, routine
tasks like mealtime have become daunting challenges. Ramirez's
youngest son, who turns 2 in April, cannot swallow, hold up his
head, speak or crawl. He has severe brain damage and doctors say he
might never learn to walk. He's fed through a tube inserted into
his belly every four hours. ``It's hard,'' said Ramirez, 27, who
lives in Austin. ``I pray he'll learn to walk one day.'' Ramirez
filed a malpractice lawsuit against her doctor on Jan. 12, claiming
that a vaginal childbirth, which caused her uterus to rupture, led
to her son's brain damage. (Tanamachi, Austin American-Statesman)

Pete the prairie dog, who burrows under the courtyard? Or Ferris
the emu, who sits atop 14 eggs which could mean as many as 14 baby
birds in the coming weeks? Or Floyd the iguana, found sunning
himself on the Bear Lakes Middle School roof Tuesday morning?

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Novice PC buyers should stick to familiar names
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ My grandfather had some ironclad rules for buying a
car. It needed a high clearance so that _ when he crossed at the
fording spot on the Caddo River near Arkadelphia _ it wouldn't
scrape on the rocks. The spark advance control needed to be
accessible from the outside so that, when he cranked the engine
himself, he could adjust the spark.
</P>
<P>
   They were excellent rules and served him well. But I doubt
they'll help you much when you buy your next family car. It's much
the same with advice on buying PCs. I write about it often, and
that's because the advice has to change with the times. So let's
spend today assembling a list of what you should look for if that
hoped-for PC didn't arrive as a holiday gift and now you're in the
mood to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an up-to-date list for what to look for when buying a PC.
This advice is aimed at the novice, by the way. My suggestions on
where to buy and what to buy would be different for an advanced
user. I'm figuring advanced PC users don't need this help and could
probably give me advice.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you're going to notice when you go shopping is
prices vary wildly nowadays. You can still pay $2,000 and more for
top-of-the-line, name-brand computers and $400 or less for a PC
from one of the many storefront operations you'll find. The
frustrating fact is some of these storefront PC shops do an
excellent job, putting together a PC with quality components. Some
are as good as the high-priced models. But if you don't know a
motherboard from a surfboard, it's next to impossible to weed out
the bad.
</P>
<P>
   So, until you learn more about computers, search one out with a
brand name you've heard of and buy the PC from a store that has
been around for two or three years. Since some small shops come and
go more frequently than the postman, you'll want to buy from a
place that has a track record. That way, odds are the store will
still be in business if you have problems later on.
</P>
<P>
   Think of buying a PC in the same way my one rich friend selects
a wine in a restaurant. He avoids the highest-priced bottles
because they're often put on the list just for flash, to make an
impression. He also stays away from the cheapest wines because,
often, their total virtue is the fact they are cheap. So think
twice before buying that $325 PC, complete with monitor. Use the
same shopping skills that would come into play if you found a
Toyota that sold for $800. You need to at least wonder why it's
selling for so little money.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing you'll notice is Intel isn't the only brand
anymore when it comes to processor chips. The processor is the chip
that does the actual computing work. In the old days, Intel was the
only sensible choice. But now _ based on which reviews you read _
some of the competing chips test out impressively. Power users
eventually develop their own prejudices as to which chip to buy.
But, in your case, I recommend you stick with the Intel chip. It's
still the target for the other chips, which attempt to emulate its
inner workings. Later, you may change your mind, but I promise you
won't feel foolish for buying Intel right now.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, make sure you get enough RAM memory when you buy your
computer. Since you're new at this, you'll feel uncomfortable _ in
the first few months _ even with the simple job of installing RAM.
And if you discover you didn't buy enough, you may end up paying
someone to install it for you. Get at least 64 megabytes of RAM
and, if you can afford it, double that amount. That's another thing
that has changed over the past couple of years. Windows now does a
much better job of turning added memory into faster performance. So
that added RAM can help supercharge your machine.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, since this topic deserves more discussion, we'll talk
about some some specific questions to ask at the computer store.
Some of these questions are very low tech and could end up saving
you a lot of grief and money.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Gathering rallies Apple faithful
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What a difference a year makes. At last January's
annual MacWorld convention in San Francisco, Apple Computer was
losing tens of millions of dollars and its share of the market had
fallen to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This year's convention, which ended Wednesday, came as Apple
Computer doubled its market share to 10 percent and had the No.
1-selling computer in the United States. And Apple posted its first
annual profit since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the first MacWorld conference that nobody thinks
will be the last MacWorld conference,'' computer industry
journalist David Pogue said as he greeted conventioneers.
</P>
<P>
   While Apple Computer has had a great year, the company remains
challenged. For one, its $309 million in earnings last year came
mostly from cost cutting and not higher sales. Annual revenues in
fiscal 1997 were $6 billion, down sharply from the company's peak
of $11 billion in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Falling revenue represents both lower prices and fewer sales,
which declined to 2.763 million in 1998. That's down from 2.874
million in 1997 and far below the company's 5 million peak in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers believe Apple Computer can survive only as a
niche player. Others think the company needs a white knight, such
as Disney or Oracle, to prosper long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Macs will never make up more than 10 percent of all desktop
machines,'' consultant Tim Bajarin told MacWorld conventioneers.
``Whether we like it or not, the desktop war is over.''
</P>
<P>
   But last week was a banner one for the Apple Computer optimists.
Consider the good news.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's iMac is the No. 1-selling computer, with 800,000-plus
units purchased since its August introduction.
</P>
<P>
   That success is luring both hardware and software developers
back to the Mac platform. Attendance at MacWorld was up 15 percent
to 420 exhibitors this year over last, according to the
convention's figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of Apple's sheer survival has died down,'' Rob
Scheschareg, MacWorld's director, told the San Jose Mercury News.
``Now the question seems to be, `What's next?' There's a lot of
enthusiasm for innovation.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Recipe sites a tool for every cook
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Food and computers have always made a strange mix. The
earliest programmers and Net wizards seemed to live on Coca-Cola
and cold pizza. But your computer and the Internet can help you
with meals a touch more elaborate than that.
</P>
<P>
   Today we'll look at some Web sites that do the expected (provide
terrific recipes) and the unexpected (offer little touches that
make good use of the unique advantages offered by a computer and an
Internet connection).
</P>
<P>
   Our first food site will furnish good examples of what we mean
on both counts. Let's go to Epicurious: Food, Drink, Cooking and
Recipes at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .epicurious.com/ahome
</P>
<P>
   /a00home/home.html to demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   This is a lavish and well-designed site. It offers a treasure
trove of recipes. Click on the recipe link at the bottom of the
page and you'll be able to ferret out even the most obscure recipe
using keywords. But there are times when you don't know what you'd
like to prepare for dessert, or, if you do know, you can't remember
the name of the dish.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the second method of searching the recipe file will
come in handy. It's divided into what seems to be nearly 100 topic
areas such as appetizers, breads, salads and so on. You can select
one of the topic areas and browse through the recipe file.
</P>
<P>
   That's the example of the expected. Any food site worth its salt
(and red pepper) offers recipes. And that's probably the most
helpful feature. But let's also use this site to see how the best
pages take an extra step toward making cooking easier and more fun.
</P>
<P>
   If you're like some beginning cooks, you may have heard someone
praise a specific ingredient or cooking utensil but need more
information. That's what you'll get at the Epicurious site, an
online dictionary that uses the computer's ability to search and
organize and the Web's knack for transmitting databases full of
information. If you want to know more about balsamic vinegar, for
instance, or even how to pronounce it, just click on the ``b'' in
the dictionary and you'll soon know the pronunciation. If you want
to know more, just use the hot link in the pronunciation guide to
visit an area where you'll learn more about vinegar than you ever
expected to know.
</P>
<P>
   Now that you know what to look for in a cooking site, you'll
appreciate the virtues of our next stop: The Culinary Connection at
http://www.culinary
</P>
<P>

   This site does a fine job with the expected recipe file (more
than 13,000 of them) and has added features that give it a unique
touch. If you're in the mood for live chat about food, you'll find
chat groups here. Or if you want to browse the thousands of Web
sites that feature food, then take a look at the links page. This
isn't the usual collection of names and links. Instead, the links
are rated by other users, so you'll be able to browse sites that
others have found useful.
</P>
<P>
   Those are two terrific general purpose sites. And, with the
collection of links on the second site, you have a way to find even
more. With all that done, let's take a look at a more exotic site
based at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   It's called The Global Gastronomer _ Cuisines of the World at
http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes
</P>
<P>
   /hupfer/global/gastronomer
</P>
<P>
   .html. If you have a special dinner party coming up and want to
prepare something out of the ordinary, you'll get some help in the
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the page is made up of links that take you to sites
dedicated to cuisine in specific countries. If the notion of
preparing that sort of a menu tickles your interest in a particular
part of the world, you can click on the country on an interactive
map and be taken to databases of information that cover more than
food.
</P>
<P>
   So when you serve the dish, you can also serve up some
information about its country of origin.

   1. CUBA'S SALSA STARS Cuba's salsa stars are its first
capitalists and, Castro fears, its most potent opposition. Castro's
government insists that Cuba is a socialist society, but a small
number of musicians today have more - much more - than the rest of
the 11 million Cubans who live on the island. They are the first
professionals in almost four decades - since the tobacco and sugar
barons, the mafiosi and the American corporations were driven out -
to accumulate wealth, the first Cubans allowed to be independent
businessmen and rich capitalists, even if they are not allowed to
invest in their own country. This preferential treatment coincides
with the country's loss of Soviet support. ``There will be more
confrontations with officials as they become a profitable
sub-culture,'' an American record producer says. ``The state will
start looking for excuses to crack down on them because they
represent freedom.'' By Silvana Paternostro. From The New York
Times Magazine. Full-length (4,000 words) + edited article
available.

FILMS AND MORALS Should we censor apparently amoral films such as
``Pulp Fiction?'' Or are they challenging us to repudiate their
twisted morality? Who is to say which film treats drugs, or
violence or sex in a responsible way, and which invites us to rush
out of the cinema and head straight for trouble? By Nigel Cliff.
From Prospect magazine. 1,000 words. (Not available U.K.)

WRESTLING HAS A HOLD ON HOLLYWOOD Four years ago, Hollywood
rediscovered the Western. Last year, disaster movies were all the
rage and this year, World War II movies dominated the screen. Next
year, moviegoers might be grappling with .... wrestling! Strange as
it sounds, there are a whole host of wrestling projects out there
right now. There are sound economic reasons why Hollywood thinks
wrestling is ``in.'' By Zorianna Kit. From The Hollywood Reporter.

LIV ULLMANN TALKS OF 'CONFESSIONS' AND BERGMAN Liv Ullmann calls
the experience of working again with Ingmar Bergman, for whom she
starred in nine films, ``like a circle, the ends coming around to
meet each other.'' The former actress, now a director, and the
retired director, now a screenwriter, have come up with 'Private
Confessions,'' inspired by an incident in Bergman's mother's life.
Interview by Betsy Sherman. BPI. 1,300 words + photo. 5. PATRICIA
ARQUETTE : ACTING TO BEAT OF A DIFFERENT DRUMMER Patricia Arquette
knows about peer pressure: not only are her father, grandfather and
siblings Rosanna, Alexis and David actors, but she is married to
superstar Nicolas Cage. But she's not intimidated, avoiding
mainstream movies to shape a distinctive career in independent
films, including Stephen Frears' ``The Hi-Lo Country.'' In this
interview Arquette talks about the new film, the experience of
working with director Frears, why she never felt competitive with
her siblings and why she doesn't worry that Cage's announced
intention to work steadily for the next five years or more may hurt
her own career. By Ian Spelling. 1,400 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 6.
STEVEN FREARS' 'COMPLICATED' WESTERN ``The Hi-Lo Country,'' a
Western, almost got made a few decades ago by American maverick
director Sam Peckinpah. Now it comes to the screen thanks to
British maverick director Stephen Frears, best known for such
non-Westerns as ``My Beautiful Launderette,'' and ``Dangerous
Liaisons.'' Frears and actors Billy Crudup, Woody Harrelson and
Patricia Arquette have concoted an admirable, imaginative addition
to the cowboy genre. By Joshua Mooney. BPI. 1,000 words + photo.

JOHN TRAVOLTA IN 'ACTION' There is a kind of performance possible
only to a movie star. It is a fascinating morphing process, tied to
the power of pop iconography. John Travolta, long on recognition as
a pop culture icon, short on recognition as an actor, has delivered
two such performances within the last 12 months. The first was in
``Primary Colors.'' The second, his extraordinary performance in
``A Civil Action,'' about a landmark toxic waste case. Much has
been written about Travolta - his comeback, his career trajectory,
his belief in Scientology. Little has been written about his
empathetic capacity and his ability to turn himself into one
character after another. By Jay Carr. From The Boston Globe. 2,100
words + photo.

   Other than the stamp, about the only thing a letter has over an
e-mail message is the idiosyncratic swirls of the sender's John
Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   This fact was not lost on H. Lee Browne, a venture capitalist
turned entrepreneur, who was determined to find a way to attach a
personal signature to an e-mail message. With his new service,
Signature-mail.com, visitors to his World Wide Web site can request
a form, which they use to fax Browne as many as 25 versions of
their penmanship. Minutes later, they receive their writing back in
digital form, for easy inclusion in e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening in e-mail is we all love it and think it's
great, but the fact is, it's eventually going to look a lot more
like paper mail,'' said Browne, who is offering the
signature-digitalization service free. ``We can't go on with it
looking all the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the inherent danger is that someone might take
somebody else's digital signature and use it inappropriately. But
Browne stressed the security of his company's computer system, and
the fact that, ``just like if I find your signature in a trash can,
I can't use it to legally bind a document.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing legally binding about this sort of
signature,'' he continued. ``This is definitely not
authentication.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Browne said, he had received expressions of interest from
banks and others about possible commercial applications of his
software.

   Intel and Compaq Dispute One Year 2000 Bug Theory
</P>
<P>
   Moving to debunk theories of a supposed Year 2000-related bug
known as the Crouch-Echlin effect, Intel and Compaq Computer, two
of the computer world's heavyweights, said last week that their own
extensive tests had found no evidence of such a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The findings could dampen fears that were first stirred in 1997
by Internet postings from Jace Crouch, a history professor in
Michigan, and Michael Echlin, a Canadian programmer, who reported
that the clocks on some computers could jump randomly forward or
backward in time after the year 2000. The jumps occurred at the
instant the computers were turned on, but not on every occasion,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   The purported problem, also known as time dilation, received new
currency last summer after a manager at Compaq's Year 2000
Expertise Center in Albany, N.Y., said that testing there had
confirmed it. Time dilation was said to affect primarily older
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Echlin proposed that the problem could arise from design flaws
in how the basic input/output system, or BIOS, chip retrieved the
time and date from a computer's real-time clock, a battery-driven
chip that keeps track of time even when the computer is off. Most
software on stand-alone personal computers relies on the BIOS for
time and date.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts had consistently dismissed the time-dilation
reports, saying faulty components rather than design bugs were
undoubtedly responsible for the reported date jumps. They were
stunned, and big corporate computer users were worried, by the
seeming confirmation from Compaq's Albany unit, which had just been
acquired in Compaq's merger with Digital Equipment Corp. The Albany
center also said it would sell diagnostic and repair tools
developed by Echlin.
</P>
<P>
   As criticism filtered back to Compaq's headquarters in Houston,
both Compaq, the leading PC maker, and Intel, the leading PC-chip
producer, set out to methodically search for the Crouch-Echlin
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's testing was especially extensive. And the company said
last week that although it could not completely rule out the
existence of time dilation, it had disproved all reported
hypotheses for how the anomaly could occur. The company also said
its tests included one machine provided by Echlin and had used his
diagnostic tools.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, meanwhile, revised its Year 2000 site
(www.compaq.com/year2000/year2000-qa.html) to say it would no
longer sell the Echlin tools. But Echlin is not ready to concede.
He said that while he had not yet seen the new research, evidence
continued to trickle in that post-2000 time dilation occurs, albeit
rarely.

   Executive Musical Chairs at Shopping.com, Again
</P>
<P>
   It sounded drastic _ the third management team in nine months.
But for Shopping.com, an Internet retailing company, it was more
like business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   The company said last week that Randall Read, an executive from
the packaging industry, would replace Shopping.com's chairman,
Frank Denny, who is becoming president and chief executive. Denny,
in turn, was replacing John Markley.
</P>
<P>
   According to Denny, Markley resigned to spend more time in the
family cabinet business. Markley had arrived in June to replace
Robert McNulty, who was president and chief executive before
leaving for undisclosed reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest shuffle, Denny, Shopping.com's founder, will take
over day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping.com, which sells housewares, sporting goods, computer
supplies, electronic gadgets and more, was initially backed by Bill
Gross, the financier who has ``incubated'' dozens of Internet
businesses through his company Idealab.
</P>
<P>
   Catching the wave of investor enthusiasm for electronic
commerce, Shopping.com's initial public offering in November 1997
was an instant success, starting at $9 a share and soon trading as
high as $39.
</P>
<P>
   But things soured. The Securities and Exchange Commission
suspended trading of Shopping.com shares for two weeks in March,
though trading resumed after the SEC found no wrongdoing by
executives of Shopping.com. But in September, an arbitration panel
of the National Association of Securities Dealers fined the
company's underwriter, Waldron &AMP; Co., on the grounds that it had
inflated Shopping.com's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Corona Del Mar, Calif., has had trouble
filling customer orders, and dozens of customers have filed
complaints with numerous consumer protection agencies. Denny
attributes these problems to an overly ambitious marketing campaign
that generated more sales than the company could handle. It grew
from $40,000 in daily sales in June to $300,000 a day by October.
After scaling back, the company now does about $100,000 in sales a
day.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping.com's shares, having dipped below $1 each last
September, closed Friday at $13.1875, up 68.75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Denny said the company was now intent on rebuilding its daily
sales volume, though more gradually than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to build a power center on the Web, a sort of
CompUSA, Home Depot and Wal-Mart,'' Denny said. But first, given
the recent upheavals, he may be busy building a power center in the
executive suite.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The world apparently sailed through the first days of 1999 with
only scattered mistakes by computers confused by the approaching
Year 2000 _ an outcome that added to growing optimism about the
chances of avoiding widespread disruptions 51 weeks from now.
</P>
<P>
   Transitions to new years are always a bug-ridden time for
information managers, because some devices and programs do not
automatically adjust calendars. But computer users had feared that
the advent of this year might be rougher than usual because many
computer programs look a full 52 weeks ahead and so would be
encountering dates in 2000 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Reports filtered in about mixups with taxi meters, with
accounting software that spewed out faulty bills or _
alternatively, failed to issue valid ones _ and similar glitches.
But the disruptions seemed to be isolated, quickly handled and in
some cases not really linked to the 2000 date at all. Year 2000
experts were especially impressed that the financial sector had
fared so well, despite having also committed huge computing
resources to the introduction of the euro, the new European
currency that began trading last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It points to the likelihood of a few hellish days rather than
big failures next year,'' said Ian Hayes, president of Clarity
Consulting, who advises large multinational clients from his base
in South Hamilton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem stems from the longtime use of just two
digits to refer to the year, and the inability of some computers to
recognize 00 as 2000. Some computers mistake 00 for 1900 while
others, programmed to expect steadily higher numbers in their
two-digit year data, cannot read 00 at all and shut down or revert
to some earlier date.
</P>
<P>
   Another uncertainty last week was whether some computers using
two-digit dates might be tripped up by programs that had used the
digits 99 to mean ``end of file,'' ``shut down'' or some other
message having nothing to do with dates. That practice was used as
a shortcut by an unknown number of programmers.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the 99 problem is a serious threat. For
one thing, the use of two or more 9s as an end-of-file signifier
within date programs is relatively rare. And even where it does
exist, it is typically easy to locate. In any case, although some
had warned that this last week was also a danger zone, Sept. 9,
1999, is seen as the most likely minefield of 9s.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the most widely reported glitches last week turned
out to be 99 problems, not failures to handle 2000. Taxis in
Singapore, for example, were unable to run their meters for several
hours on Jan. 1. And some in Stockholm _ to the delight of Swedes
out celebrating the New Year _ were unable to switch to higher
fares authorized for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler Corp. discovered on Jan. 1 that a program in its
regional data centers that helps run auto production had a 99
problem that could be fixed by the same patch the company was
planning to install later this quarter to deal with a Year 2000
defect. So Chrysler rushed the patching job through, and no
disruptions were suffered, according to Roger Buck, head of the
company's Year 2000 project.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. said it encountered four minor glitches,
including a commodities accounting program that would not allow it
to schedule a metals payment in the Year 2000. It turned out that
all four defects had been identified by Goldman's code scanners and
would have been scheduled to be eliminated anyway by program fixes
set for this spring. ``I feel good about that, but it doesn't mean
we are going to cut back on our contingency planning or other Year
2000 work,'' said Leslie Tortora, the firm's chief technology
officer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As expected, government computers in Washington and in several
states were unable to sign people up for unemployment benefits
using standard forms, which set a date one year ahead as the end of
the benefits. But, as previously planned, those agencies continued
to sign people up for the benefits last week by plugging in Dec.
31, 1999, as the ending dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will create a nightmare of paperwork to rework these if it
goes on for long, but most systems should be ready for Year 2000
dates by the end of this quarter,'' said Howard Waddell, a Labor
Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, chairman of President Clinton's Council on Year
2000 Conversion, said the unemployment benefit scramble underscored
the need to plan for breakdowns well in advance. He said he was
worried that last week's calm might encourage local governments and
small businesses to settle on ``wait until it breaks'' policies.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental Systems Products in Bohemia, N.Y., was one company
that paid a price for not paying attention in time. One of three
companies that supplies automobile emission-testing equipment for
use in New York state, Environmental Systems was surprised to
discover that equipment it had been phasing out could not produce a
00 windshield sticker for drivers whose vehicles had passed
inspection. Stickers in New York use two digits for the month and
two digits for the year to indicate the expiration date for an
emissions validation.
</P>
<P>
   The 00 sticker should have started appearing Dec. 22 because New
York motorists get a grace period of eight days for their one-year
validations. But the older Environmental Systems equipment printed
out stickers saying 91 instead, and many inspection stations simply
put them on car windows. Parking agents promptly began ticketing
the apparently out-of-date cars.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental Systems quickly reported the problem to the state
and procedures were set up to quash the tickets, but the crash
effort to complete the transition to newer equipment that issues 00
stickers was not completed until last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost a lot of money,'' said James Richardson, the company's
director of operations.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, the consultant, cautions ``there are a hundred problems
for every one reported.'' And he and others also warn that
companies with a faulty program creating bad data may not realize
it yet. Nevertheless, after this first week of the Year 2000
shakedown cruise, Hayes said it was hard not to see the results as
good news.

PRETEENS: WHERE SHOULD YOU DRAW THE LINE?

<TEXT>
<P>
   Did your preteen get invited to a New Year's Eve party? Not an
all-girl or
</P>
<P>
   all-boy sleepover, but a boy-girl dress-up party with music and
dancing and
</P>
<P>
   who knows what else? Or was there a party to which your child
didn't get
</P>
<P>
   invited?
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the social life of the 10- to 12-year-old, no
parent has
</P>
<P>
   it easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The variability in kids this age is enormous,'' says child
psychiatrist
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Greenspan of George Washington University. At one end of
the scale are
</P>
<P>
   children with surging hormones and a budding curiosity about the
opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, children are oblivious.
</P>
<P>
   If she could choose how her child would be, preteen researcher
Margaret
</P>
<P>
   Sagarese would go for oblivious. ``The worst that happens is
hurt feelings and
</P>
<P>
   a new set of friends,'' she says. For the precocious child,
there can be dire
</P>
<P>
   consequences: The National Center for Health Statistics
estimates that 3.2 of
</P>
<P>
   every 1,000 girls aged 10 to 14 gets pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, when a child is oblivious, parents can
inadvertently be the
</P>
<P>
   cause of a problem. ``If you weren't popular in high school,
your buttons may
</P>
<P>
   get pushed,'' says Sagarese. ``You say things like, `All your
friends are
</P>
<P>
   going to the party, don't you want to go?' '' Sagarese is
co-author of ``The
</P>
<P>
   Roller Coaster Years'' (Broadway Books), a book on middle-school
children.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't high school, though, and at this age, not being
social in a
</P>
<P>
   boy-girl way is not a stigma or a popularity issue. Not only do
these parents
</P>
<P>
   end up pushing a child into situations prematurely, but they
also send a
</P>
<P>
   message that can have deleterious effects by the time he is in
high school:
</P>
<P>
   that you should do something just because everyone else is doing
it.
</P>
<P>
   If your child isn't invited to an event and doesn't care, or is
invited
</P>
<P>
   but doesn' want to go, Sagarese tells parents to back off and
not worry. If a
</P>
<P>
   child is upset she isn't included, trying to make her feel
better -- ``Who
</P>
<P>
   cares about that stupid party, anyway?'' -- will only make her
think you
</P>
<P>
   don't understand. Instead, validate her feelings -- ``It's hard
not to be
</P>
<P>
   included.'' If friendships begin to shift and a child is hurt,
be honest: ``It
</P>
<P>
   seems like your interests aren't the same anymore. She's
interested in boys,
</P>
<P>
   you're not. That happens sometimes to friends. It's hard, but
you can still
</P>
<P>
   have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   For the parent whose child is socially active, the concerns are
very
</P>
<P>
   different.
</P>
<P>
   ``To assume this is innocent is a mistake,'' says Joan Lipsitz,
founder of
</P>
<P>
   the Center for Early Adolescence at the University of North
Carolina and a
</P>
<P>
   middle-school consultant.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't a given that a 10- to 12-year-old who wants to spend
time with an
</P>
<P>
   opposite-sex peer is experiencing sexual feelings. ``More
typically, it's a
</P>
<P>
   kind of playacting. They're trying on what they see older kids
doing,'' says
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, who is author of ``Playground Politics'' (Addison
Wesley).
</P>
<P>
   But it is likely this girl or boy is wondering, ``Am I lovable?
Am I
</P>
<P>
   attractive? Am I masculine/feminine?''
</P>
<P>
   Once they get a ``yes'' from one person, Sagarese says, they
tend to move
</P>
<P>
   on to someone else to test it out again. The child who is stuck
on one peer
</P>
<P>
   for weeks or months -- parents might call it a crush -- or who
pushes on a
</P>
<P>
   regular basis for activities that have a dating patina -- going
to the movies
</P>
<P>
   or the mall or buying him or her presents -- may be at risk for
unsafe
</P>
<P>
   behavior.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just an issue of age but also of judgment. ``They can
be so
</P>
<P>
   mindless,'' says John Serino, principal of the Belmonte Middle
School in
</P>
<P>
   Saugus, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   What keeps children safe, say Serino and others, is structure
and
</P>
<P>
   supervision. Parents can't be wimps about either. When we are,
we become what
</P>
<P>
   Serino calls ``enablers'': ``Every time you allow your kid to do
something
</P>
<P>
   with a mature social concept, you enable him to grow up too
fast. That's
</P>
<P>
   risky.''
</P>
<P>
   Serino believes this so strongly that he did away with dances at
his
</P>
<P>
   school, and only grudgingly allows an end-of-the-year social
from 6:30 to 8:30
</P>
<P>
   p.m. (anything later is too adultlike). He won't even allow a
local church to
</P>
<P>
   advertise dances at the school, even though the dances are only
for grades 6
</P>
<P>
   to 8.
</P>
<P>
   Sagarese wishes parents were as vigilant. ``When you just let
things happen
</P>
<P>
   because you don't know what to do or you're afraid of
embarrassing your child,
</P>
<P>
   even if kids aren't doing or thinking anything sexual, they are
getting a
</P>
<P>
   message that going down this path is what they should be doing.
You are
</P>
<P>
   saying, `This quasi-romantic, quasi-sexual path is for you. I
approve.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake,'' she continues. ``It's a path that leads
someplace.
</P>
<P>
   If they're slow-dancing in fifth grade, don't kid yourself about
what happens
</P>
<P>
   in seventh.''
</P>
<P>
   Her research shows that what happens in seventh is oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids were raised knowing about AIDS, so they've seized
on oral sex
</P>
<P>
   as a compromise,'' she says. ``They see it as safe and casual.''
Although AIDS
</P>
<P>
   is unlikely to be an issue at age 10 or 11, it is not unheard
of, and she says
</P>
<P>
   HIV can be transmitted through oral sex if there's a sore in the
mouth such as
</P>
<P>
   the kind children develop from braces.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lipsitz and Sagarese agree it's hard to stop a child
who is intent
</P>
<P>
   on physical intimacy, vigilance can reduce the likelihood of
risky behavior
</P>
<P>
   (see accompanying box). One piece of good news Lipsitz offers is
that even if
</P>
<P>
   an 11-year-old does something like kiss, it doesn't mean this
will become a
</P>
<P>
   regular activity. ``Kids do a lot of things one time and then
not again for a
</P>
<P>
   very long time,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   So your 12-year-old daughter has invited two boys over and they
want to go
</P>
<P>
   to her room and close the door. What do you do?
</P>
<P>
   Be respectful but firm, says Greenspan. ``Ask, `What is it you
want to do
</P>
<P>
   that you need the door shut?' They want `privacy' or they want
to turn up the
</P>
<P>
   music really loud? `That's fine,' tell them. `You can do that
with the door
</P>
<P>
   open.' '' Your child will probably balk. Don't get into
negotiations; stand
</P>
<P>
   firm. Similarly, fifth- or sixth-graders may push to go to the
mall or movies
</P>
<P>
   to hang out. Make sure they have a plan for the mall, arrange to
meet them at
</P>
<P>
   a restaurant; at the movies, go along but give them breathing
space, say, by
</P>
<P>
   sitting six rows behind them. Just dropping them off at either
venue becomes
</P>
<P>
   the enabling behavior Serino talks about.
</P>
<P>
   At a party, Sagarese says supervision means being in and out of
the room,
</P>
<P>
   refilling snacks and drinks, but not standing guard. Before you
agree to host
</P>
<P>
   a party, spell this out to your child. Tell him, ``This is my
job as a
</P>
<P>
   parent.'' If he says friends won't like it, a good response is
``If they don't
</P>
<P>
   understand, they aren't good friends to have.''
</P>
<P>
   A parent's worst fantasy, of course, is walking in on something
</P>
<P>
   inappropriate. Ever hear of a game called Lemon? Sagarese says
it's popular
</P>
<P>
   among 11-year-olds in some parts of the country. Participants
write names of
</P>
<P>
   body parts on scraps of paper, then take turns picking the
papers at random
</P>
<P>
   and describing whether they would like to lick, touch, or just
look at the
</P>
<P>
   body part. She knows one parent who walked in on the game and
walked back out
</P>
<P>
   again, flabbergasted but paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of makes you long for `Spin the Bottle,' '' says
Sagarese.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Serino would tell a parent in that situation to do:
``Say to
</P>
<P>
   the group, `This is not a game for kids your age,' or pull your
child aside
</P>
<P>
   and give him the option of stopping it before you do.'' Doing
anything less,
</P>
<P>
   he says, surrenders moral leadership.
</P>
<P>
   If you know for a fact, either from observation or overheard
conversations,
</P>
<P>
   that your child is sexually curious, ``I'd be having lots of
conversations,''
</P>
<P>
   says Sagarese. There are no magic words, but the main message to
get across is
</P>
<P>
   that sex is a wonderful thing, ``but you're too young for
anything but
</P>
<P>
   kissing.' '' Set up the idea that sex happens in stages;
otherwise, she
</P>
<P>
   says, kids go to intercourse at 14.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, shift your child's focus from sex to
personality traits:
</P>
<P>
   ``David makes you feel special, doesn't he? What is it about him
that you
</P>
<P>
   like so much?'' ``Is Jenny someone who could keep a secret?
Loyalty is a trait
</P>
<P>
   I admire in a person.''
</P>
<P>
   The more children this age do things in groups, the better, says
Lipsitz.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry if the group is lopsided, three girls and two boys
or even three
</P>
<P>
   and one. ``That's a pal group,'' she says. But consider it a red
flag if it's
</P>
<P>
   consistently two and two, especially if one ``couple'' stays the
same. ``That
</P>
<P>
   smacks of romantic overtones for somebody,'' she says, and it
can lead to
</P>
<P>
   experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   Sagarese says a parent's goal isn't to stop feelings but to
guide them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids need help to understand what their emotions are all about
and to act
</P>
<P>
   on them in appropriate ways. If you fall down doing that, what
they do at 10
</P>
<P>
   and 11 ends up as practice for what they will do at 13 and 14.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - In the lingo of preteens, ``going out'' means talking on the
phone and
</P>
<P>
   walking together to classes. ``Dating'' means going to the
movies or the mall.
</P>
<P>
   - Clues that your child is curious about sex: magazines she
reads; phone
</P>
<P>
   calls to peers of the opposite sex; conversations about the
opposite sex;
</P>
<P>
   interest in activities that look like dates.
</P>
<P>
   - Children with older siblings are more likely to engage the
opposite sex
</P>
<P>
   at a young age.
</P>
<P>
   - Keep socialization to age-mates. In these years, there are big
</P>
<P>
   developmental differences between children only two years apart.
Even hanging
</P>
<P>
   out with the friends of a slightly older sibling can expose a
10- to
</P>
<P>
   12-year-old to risky behavior.
</P>
<P>
   - Get together with parents of your children's friends. The more
consistent
</P>
<P>
   you all are in setting limits, the more likely it is that
parents, not
</P>
<P>
   children, will set behavior standards.
</P>
<P>
   - Don't be embarrassed or intimidated to call a child's parents
to ask
</P>
<P>
   about supervision at their house.

 &HT;    Now, even more of America can tune in `The Truman Show'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Truman Show'' (PG)
</P>
<P>
   Truman Burbank's life is so picture-postcard perfect, it doesn't
seem real. And it isn't. In director Peter Weir's comedy-drama, Jim
Carrey plays the unwitting star of a 12-hour documentary, unaware
that his life is constantly filmed, and that his picturesque
seaside village is actually the world's largest self-contained
sound stage. While the movie never finds a way to develop its plot
beyond easy social satire, the movie is a pleasure thanks to
supporting work from Laura Linney as Truman's ``wife'' (actually,
an actress), and especially from Ed Harris as the show's godlike
producer, and surrogate father for Truman. Grade: B +

 &HT;    Mini views of recently released movies
 &HT;    By Steve Murray and Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dance With Me'' (PG) _ A guilty, quick-stepping pleasure.
Vanessa L. Williams plays a Houston dance instructor who hopes to
recapture dance competition glory with the help of a Cuban newcomer
(Latin music star Chayanne). Original it isn't, but ``Dance'' is
great fun. It's the first film that lets Williams show off her
knockout dancing, and in his first Hollywood flick, Chayanne goes
for Hollywood heartthrob status. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Henry Fool'' (R) _ More challenging but irritatingly oblique
foolishness from Hal Hartley. A nerdy, withdrawn garbageman (James
Urbaniak) is befriended by a grandiose, overbearing stranger
(Thomas Jay Ryan) with literary pretensions and a secret past.
Encouraged to write himself, the protege surpasses his mentor.
Hartley has wit and an eccentric vision. But his trademark monotone
style is emotionally deadening. The movie just goes on and on and
on.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C -
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``54'' (R) _ Buy the soundtrack, skip the flick. This
tidied-up, fictionalized look at New York's ground zero of '70s
excess presents Studio 54 as a home for an alternative family of
sweet-hearted bartenders and would-be singers. Ryan Phillippe plays
the Jersey kid who doesn't seem to realize the only reason he gets
attention is because he's a cute piece of meat. The movie doesn't
seem to realize it, either. The only live performance comes from
Mike Myers as a drugged-out Steve Rubell. Grade: C -
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Pi '' (R) _ Math prodigy Max (Sean Gulette) thinks he may
have cracked the code to all existence in a 216-digit code he
discovers. And it's a code a bunch of other people want in this
black-and-white, science fiction fever-dream. Made for only
$60,000, it's rich with young filmmaking vigor and ambition. Grade:
B +
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Wilde'' (R) _ Stephen Fry delivers a sympathetic, smart
performance as famed playwright Oscar Wilde, whose affair with
Alfred Lord Douglas (Jude Law) destroyed his life. The strong
supporting cast includes Vanessa Redgrave, but the film is
everything Wilde was not: conventional. Grade: C +

 &HT;    A magical `Fair Lady'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Audrey Hepburn made two movies with her first husband, Mel
Ferrer (``War and Peace'' and ``Green Mansions''). Best skip them
and, instead, savor the on-screen magic between her and Rex
Harrison in ``My Fair Lady.'' This beautifully restored DVD version
of the acclaimed Oscar-winning musical looks wonderful, as you
might expect, but it also offers some enticing bonuses. Such as
commentary by art director Gene Allen and by singer Marni Nixon
(she subbed for Hepburn on the songs as she had done for Natalie
Wood in ``West Side Story''). Plus, for those really into this
movie and/or the ever-fair Hepburn, you can hear her versions of
the songs ``Show Me'' and ``Wouldn't It Be Loverly?''

 &HT;    Off-screen couples show on-screen chemistry
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'd think that after ``Shanghai Surprise,'' the picture he
made in 1986 with Wife No. 1, Madonna, Sean Penn would steer clear
of marital movie efforts. Yet he and Wife No. 2, Robin Wright Penn,
have acted together twice since tying the knot: first in ``She's So
Lovely,'' and now in ``Hurlyburly,'' which opens Friday. And
neither the marriage nor their careers seem in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Husband-and-wife teams appearing together is hardly a rarity in
Hollywood. Think of Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, Tom Cruise
and Nicole Kidman, Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy, Alec Baldwin and
Kim Basinger, Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, Warren Beatty and
Annette Bening. And, of course, Bogart and Bacall.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the marriages survived. Not all the movies worked. But
if you want to check out the on-screen chemistry of some of
Hollywood's more famous wedded couples, here are a few ideas.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward
</P>
<P>
   How they met: Introduced by an agent while making the theatrical
rounds in New York. They got to know each other better when both
were cast in ``Picnic'' on Broadway. He had a three-line role; she
understudied the two female leads.
</P>
<P>
   Some movies they've acted in together: ``The Long Hot Summer,''
``Paris Blues,'' ``Winning,'' ``The Drowning Pool,'' ``Harry and
Son''
</P>
<P>
   The one to rent: ``Mr. &AMP; Mrs. Bridge'' (1990)
</P>
<P>
   Newman and Woodward play Walter and India Bridge, a well-bred,
white-bread couple living in Kansas City in the '30s and '40s. The
Bridges have measured out their lives in coffee spoons. Sterling
silver ones. The movie may be a bit slow but it shows the minutiae
of these well-cushioned, bestilled lives with excruciating
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Richard Burton and Elizabeth
</P>
<P>
   Taylor
</P>
<P>
   How they met: Very publicly, in Rome, on the set of
``Cleopatra.'' Pre-Rome, he'd disparaged her, saying, ``I must don
my armor to play against Miss Tits.'' Obviously, his opinion
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Some movies they've acted in together: ``The Taming of the
Shrew,'' ``The Sandpiper,'' ``The Comedians,'' ``Under Milk Wood''
</P>
<P>
   The one to rent: ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' (1966)
</P>
<P>
   Mike Nichols made his directorial debut directing the fun couple
of the '60s as another fun couple of the '60s: George (Burton), the
bullied academician with the brutal tongue, and Martha (Taylor),
the blowzy harridan to whom he's married. George Segal and Sandy
Dennis are the young couple invited over for fun 'n' games (one is
Get the Guests). The movie nabbed 13 Oscar nominations, including
best actor and best actress for the stars (she won, he didn't).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan
</P>
<P>
   How they met: While filming ``Innerspace,'' a
comedy/fantasy/thriller directed by Joe Dante (``Gremlins'').
Actually, they had hardly any scenes together. As Ryan said in an
interview, ``There were very few minutes when he (Quaid) isn't five
inches tall and inside Martin Short's intestines.'' (See the movie;
you'll understand.)
</P>
<P>
   Some movies they've acted in together: ``Innerspace,'' ``Flesh
and Bone''
</P>
<P>
   The one to rent: ``D.O.A.'' (1988)
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing the premise (but little else) from a '50s film noir of
the same name, ``D.O.A.'' is definitely alive and kicking. Quaid
plays a college professor who's been poisoned by a slow-acting
toxin and spends his last days tracking down his killer. Ryan is a
fresh-faced freshman on his side. The directors are Rocky Morton
and Annabel Jankel, co-creators of Max Headroom.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson
</P>
<P>
   How they met: They were cast as a married couple in the BBC
miniseries ``Fortunes of War,'' which later aired on ``Masterpiece
Theatre.''
</P>
<P>
   Some movies they've acted in together: ``Henry V,'' ``Much Ado
About Nothing,'' ``Peter's Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The one to rent: ``Dead Again'' (1991)
</P>
<P>
   Branagh is a cynical L.A. detective whose quest to help a
beautiful amnesiac (Thompson) ties him to a headline-grabbing
scandal from the '40s in which a celebrated concert pianist (also
Branagh) was sentenced to death for murdering his wife (Thompson
again). This reincarnation/mystery-thriller may be high-class hooey
at heart _ a New Age nonesuch decked out in Hitchcockian trappings.
But even at its thinnest _ and it can get pretty thin _ ``Dead
Again'' is always lively. Plus, Branagh's direction gives it a fine
theatrical charge.

WE'D BE WISE TO QUESTION `SMART GROWTH'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember this phrase: ``Smart growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two little words. But they are about to become the defining
battle cry in the next great showdown between liberals and
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you thought that the conservative revolution was complete
_ that the liberal philosophy of politics and government had been
vanquished, had been consigned to the trash heap of history. Didn't
President Clinton declare not long ago that the era of big
government was over? Didn't Clinton support welfare reform,
reduction of the federal bureaucracy, even selective tax cuts?
</P>
<P>
   Sure he did. But that was politics. Clinton and his
government-loving disciples believe that government is the ultimate
force for good in the world _ that government is the instrument by
which every problem known to humankind can be alleviated.
</P>
<P>
   And so Clinton dispatches his vice president and would-be
successor, Al Gore, to spread the gospel of smart growth.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore announced the Clinton administration's plan to include
$9.5 billion for smart growth in its new budget proposal, the
likely Democratic nominee in next year's presidential race set the
stage for a massive effort by the federal government to control
economic development in local communities.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report in USA Today, smart growth ``is bound to
become the political mantra of the new millennium. It likely will
be one of the main issues in Gore's bid for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The premise of smart growth, it seems, is that everything
Americans think of as growth _ including staples of economic
development such as home-building and road construction _ is not
smart. New highways, housing developments, shopping centers, office
plazas _ all that is dumb, say the advocates of smart growth.
</P>
<P>
   The road to smart growth, say its supporters, is paved with ...
well, it's not paved at all. Smart growth is about making vast
expanses of America off-limits to developers. It's about forcing
Americans out of their private automobiles and onto mass transit
systems. It's about government bureaucrats deciding and dictating
how Americans should be permitted to use their property, travel
from place to place, conduct their business and live their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Smart growth. It sounds so innocent, so positive. The
alternative to smart growth, after all, would have to be stupid
growth _ wouldn't it?
</P>
<P>
   You might think so. But in fact, smart growth is a euphemism for
no growth.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. Gore is a hero to those who believe that
economic development represents a lethal threat to the Earth and
its inhabitants. To fanatical environmentalists, concrete is a
symbol of apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of preserving the environment, Gore has written, will
be the fundamental organizing principle of society in the coming
century.
</P>
<P>
   And so Clinton and Gore embrace smart growth, which proposes to
focus the power and resources of the federal bureaucracy on the
task of fostering an idyllic vision of America that demonizes
development.
</P>
<P>
   The smart-growth plan offers federal tax credits to ``protect''
billions of dollars' worth of American real estate from what its
backers consider the scourge of development. It extends the federal
bureaucracy's reach into local communities by using federal
subsidies to influence previously local decisions in matters such
as land use and transportation planning.
</P>
<P>
   And the fixation on smart growth clearly diminishes the federal
government's traditional role of financing highway construction.
The administration has budgeted more than $6 billion to promote
mass transit, despite the desperate need for new and improved roads
all across America.
</P>
<P>
   Look, folks. No sensible American is opposed to reasonable
measures to protect the environment and preserve natural resources
against undue encroachment by developers. But the key word here is
``reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   We need to keep an eye on the smart-growth crowd. ``Reasonable''
is not a word that crusading liberals understand.

 &HT;    Simmering stew is the perfect antidote to winter
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is the dead of winter, and as chill winds and gray
gloom threaten to creep under the windowsill, the kitchen kicks
into high gear as the heart of the home. Add a pot of stew
simmering on the stove and high-octane warmth can chase away any
winter melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   This timeless mix of meats and vegetables, herbs and spices in a
savory gravy is a basic and elemental dish that has been prepared
for eons by people throughout the world. From the robust beef, lamb
and potato combinations favored in the British Isles to the spicy
blends of meats, raisins and chickpeas eaten in Morocco to the
delicate fish stews of the Mediterranean, most every country has
its signature stew.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, though, that stew is not a quick fix. Like the season,
it is a contemplative pursuit that requires time and thought and
instinct. Each ingredient must be nurtured, coaxed and adjusted so
it enhances the others and blends rather than overpowers.
</P>
<P>
   Stew is one dish that really does taste better after a day or
two. So make enough when you have the time; add a loaf of crusty
bread and maybe a salad and you are set for part of the week.
</P>
<P>
   A good way to learn what the Internet has to offer you in the
kitchen with that new computer you may have received over the
holidays is to search out new and different stew recipes. Not only
will you be amazed at the stunning variety, but as you link up with
other sites, you will get a geography lesson as well.
</P>
<P>
   During our search we found ourselves deep into the history,
culture and cuisine of Ireland, all the while being serenaded by
bagpipes over the speaker. Another click found us in a place called
Bizkaia, which is in the Basque country of Spain, and meeting a
most amazing indigenous stew recipe containing four or five meats,
dozens of vegetables including lettuce, and even eggs.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have the time for a virtual trip around the world,
make your first stop
http://soar.berkeley.edu/recipes/stews/indexall.html for tons of
just recipes ranging from an exotic lamb stew with chestnuts and
pomegranates, to the hearty stew favored by the citizens of County
Cork, to a robust Italian variation of beef stew that features
wine-braised beef served over creamy polenta. For some African
stews and other dishes that are at least as tantalizing to read
about as they are to prepare, call up
http://ivu.org/recipes/african.html.
</P>
<P>
   If you have the greatest stew-making implement of the 20th
century, the crockpot, call up
http://southernfood.miningco.com/library/cprec/bl424.htm for an
index of recipes that includes Basque, French, Mexican, Italian and
Native American stews along with standard American beef and lamb.
</P>
<P>
   Some lovely pasta stews with ingredients geared to seasonal
availability can be found at

into seafood, beef and veal. A list of hearty vegetarian stews can
be found at http://www.suma.co.uk/rec-stews.html. Epicurious adds

 &HT;    Candy cake gets quick response
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In November, Joann Brewer of Conyers (Ga.) asked if
anyone had a recipe from a magazine like one she lost for Texas
Pecan Candy Cake, a dessert she said her whole family liked.
</P>
<P>
   Soon three possibilities arrived _ one of them the same recipe
taken from a 1985 issue of Family Circle magazine. Jean Dollar of
Snellville (Ga.), who sent that one, has made the cake many times,
too, often when she makes fruitcakes during the holidays. She
agrees it's delicious, ``but very rich,'' and adds, ``the longer it
sits, the better it gets.'' Our tester likes it, too, and echoes
that it is best to wait the full two weeks for the flavors to
mellow in the refrigerator.

 &HT;    When it comes to brews, everybody has a favorite
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``I must say, I am surprised at you.''
</P>
<P>
   A good knuckle-rapping should carry the weight of unbending
conviction, and Robert Manns' did. Manns was not merely aggrieved,
he was ``multiply aggrieved.''
</P>
<P>
   And he was not the only one, although he may have been the
wittiest.
</P>
<P>
   Manns, an Atlanta playwright, wondered if the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution's picks as Atlanta's 10 Best Beers last month
were a perverse joke. Not that he disagreed in every instance, but
where in the world, he wondered, was the Old Ivy Pale Ale made by
John Harvard's in Atlanta and Roswell (Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   And how could anyone, he asks, omit Sweetwater Festive Ale, a
seasonal sold in 1-liter bottles for $8. ``Ah, now that beer is so
fresh and so lightly spiced,'' Mann reports. ``It's a dark beer
without darkness in the taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Manns presents a formidable bill of particulars. But life is
full of choices, and you live with what you choose, right?
</P>
<P>
   It happens that a number of readers would have chosen very
differently, while others would have chosen in more or less the
same way. And, believe it or not, an enlightened few would have
chosen exactly as I did, beer for beer.
</P>
<P>
   That's the fun of picking 10-best lists. You can't be entirely
wrong, and there will always be someone who thinks you've hit the
nail on the head.
</P>
<P>
   No one so far has taken issue with the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution's choice of Percy's Pale Ale, brewed at
Percy's Fish House, as Best in Atlanta for 1998. But some thought
the Silent Screamer India Pale Ale at U.S. Border Brewery and
Cantina in Alpharetta (Ga.) was its equal, and others, like Manns,
were withholding judgment until they sampled it.
</P>
<P>
   Readers' responses to the Journal-Constitution's Top 10 list
showed, more than anything else, a surprising awareness of who's
been brewing what. More than one reader voiced the opinion that the
Seven Sisters Munchener at Phoenix Brewing Co. _ which made the
Journal-Constitution's Top 10 in 1997 but missed out (narrowly) in
1998 _ has been the most consistently excellent local beer since
the arrival of brewpubs.
</P>
<P>
   And it just might be.
</P>
<P>
   But a reader new to Atlanta, Debra Stacey, declared herself a
devotee of stouts _ Guinness in particular _ and said she was tired
of seeing brown ales wherever she went. Not just in brewpubs, but
in bottles as well. ``Newcastle's the worst,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I don't blame you, Debra. An English-style brown ale is a dull
beer. That's why the American-style browns at Max Lager's and at
U.S. Border were on our Top 10 _ stand-up beers that are bold
variations on a tired theme.
</P>
<P>
   Many readers wrote or e-mailed saying they missed the Kickin'
Cactus India Pale Ale no longer on tap at U.S. Border. Strictly
speaking, the Kickin' Cactus might not have been a true IPA, but it
was a pale ale in every respect and a different one at that. Chris
Terenzi, the new brewer at U.S. Border, would be smart to replace
one of the two IPAs now on tap with a version of the Kickin'
Cactus. Both the Three Silo and the Silent Screamer are, after all,
the same beer, the only difference being a smidgen more hop
character in the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Others offered briefs for the medal-winning Iron Horse Stout and
the new India Pale Ale at Rock Bottom. ``I've been to most of the
local brewpubs,'' wrote Jim Davis of Atlanta, ``and I find the beer
at Rock Bottom closest to what I used to enjoy in Denver. The stout
is outstanding, and, since you seem to like IPAs, I recommend you
try the one there.''
</P>
<P>
   I like the Iron Horse, too, but have to disagree on the IPA. I
liked Clay Gentry's old one better, even if it wasn't as hoppy as I
might have wanted. The Bramling Cross hops _ which Gentry says lost
their freshness too quickly _ gave the beer a soft, lemon-grass
finish that was different from the citrusy or piney notes of many
American-style IPAs.
</P>
<P>
   One test of any Top 10 list is whether you would make the same
choices a month later. It hasn't been quite that long and the
regrets about having to omit this beer or that beer are the same,
but regrets are not recantations. These were fairly calloused
knuckles even before Robert Manns took his rod to them.
</P>
<P>
   Many readers wrote or e-mailed saying they missed the Kickin'
Cactus India Pale Ale no longer on tap at U.S. Border. Strictly
speaking, the Kickin' Cactus might not have been a true IPA, but it
was a pale ale in every respect and a different one at that.

 &HT;    Resolved: Can't-resist-'em favorites aren't off-limits when
they're these flavorful, pared-down versions
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I wish I could tell you I found the perfect replacement for hot,
greasy, salty tortilla chips. Or that you can go ahead and eat
deep-fried chiles rellenos stuffed with half a cup of cheese and
still lose weight or be healthy.
</P>
<P>
   When I become a fairy godmother, I'll remember these wishes.
Promise. But until then, there are tasty alternatives that will
allow you to keep your resolutions and tantalize your Tex-Mex taste
buds, too.
</P>
<P>
   For quesadillas, try Rancho La Puerta chef Bill Wavrin's trick
and use chopped grilled veggies and a small amount of part-skim
mozzarella as the base. Then add just a teaspoon of a strongly
flavored crumbled cheese, such as blue cheese or feta, and cook in
a nonstick pan or a skillet lightly coated with vegetable spray.
</P>
<P>
   Soft tacos with grilled chicken cut in cubes and mixed with
cilantro are light and lean. For a crispy shell, Weight Watchers
suggests draping soft corn tortillas directly over the bars of your
oven rack and baking for 10 minutes at 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Think guacamole is out of the question? You won't when you try
the recipe below. Same goes for cheese dip and chips. We also have
lighter versions of cheese enchiladas, beans, chiles rellenos and
shredded beef tacos. Try these and we're sure a fiesta will fit in
your diet plan anytime.

   Baked Tortilla Chips
</P>
<P>
   Makes 24 chips Preparation time: 5 minutes Cooking time: 5-7
minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cookbook author Paulette Mitchell, who taught two cooking
classes at Rancho La Puerta the week I was there, offers this
alternative to fried chips.
</P>
<P>
   4 7- or 8-inch flour tortillas
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Use kitchen scissors to cut each
tortilla into 6 wedges. Arrange in a single layer on an ungreased
baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until crisp, about 5-7
minutes. The chips will continue to crisp as they cool. The chips
can be made in advance and stored in an airtight container at room
temperature for a few days.

   Microwave `Baked' Chips
</P>
<P>
   Makes 72 chips Preparation time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: about 30 minutes (about 5-7 minutes per batch)
</P>
<P>
   Noted Mexican cookbook author Rick Bayless discovered the
microwave is perfect for creating low-fat chips. The time it takes
for the wedges to crisp will depend on how powerful your microwave
is. The thinner and fresher the corn tortilla, the better.
</P>
<P>
   12 corn tortillas
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable oil for brushing or misting
</P>
<P>
   Salt, preferably kosher or sea salt
</P>
<P>
   Lay the tortillas out on a cutting board, lightly spray, brush
or mist both sides with oil, then cut each tortilla into 6 wedges.
Lay the wedges out in a single layer on the bottom of the microwave
oven. Microwave on high for 1 1/2 minutes. Turn the tortilla wedges
over and microwave for another 1 1/2 minutes. Continue turning and
microwaving at 1 1/2-minute intervals, moving the wedges around if
some seem to be browning more than others, until they are crisp
(remember, as they cool, they'll crisp even more). Total
microwaving time is likely to be 5-7 minutes. Immediately toss the
chips with salt and serve.

</P>
<P>
   Cilantro sprigs (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Drain tomatoes and tomatoes with chiles in a colander over a

   Still want to indulge in this traditionally high-fat dip?
</P>
<P>
   Here the fat is cut in half when the avocados are combined with
other green veggies for a winning concoction by Bill Wavrin, chef
at Rancho La Puerta.
</P>
<P>
   Try it once and you'll see.
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup broccoli florets
</P>
<P>
   1 cup fresh or frozen peas
</P>
<P>
   1 medium avocado (about 8 ounces), peeled and seeded
</P>
<P>
   1 medium tomato, diced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 red onion, finely diced
</P>
<P>
   1 green onion, trimmed and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
</P>

</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
</P>
<P>
   4 to 6 tablespoons fresh lime juice
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   In a small saucepan, cook the broccoli in gently boiling water
for about 10 minutes, until soft.
</P>
<P>
   Add the peas and simmer for about 3 minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   Drain and cool.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the broccoli and peas to a food processor; add the
avocado and process until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Scrape the mixture into a bowl. Add the tomato, red onion, green
onion, jalapeno, garlic and cilantro and season to taste with lime
juice and salt.

   Cooking time: 5-7 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Usually, refried beans are not only fried, but fried in lard.
Here's an alternative from ``The American Medical Association's
Family Health Cookbook'' (Pocket Books, $30) that will satisfy
without clogging those arteries.
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons chili powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cumin
</P>
<P>
   2 cans (16 ounces each) pinto beans, rinsed and drained, or 3
1/2 cups cooked pinto beans
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup chopped red onion
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 pickled jalapeno peppers, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 to 6 tablespoons warm water
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Toast the chili powder and cumin in a small skillet over medium
heat, stirring, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In a blender or the work bowl of a food processor, combine the
beans, onion, jalapeno(s) and toasted spices. Pulse to make a
coarse puree. With the motor running, add warm water to thin to a
spreadable consistency. Season with salt and pepper to taste. (You
can also mash the beans with the seasonings in a bowl, using a
potato masher.)
</P>
<P>
   Use immediately at room temperature as a sandwich spread or warm
the beans in a saucepan over low heat, stirring, until heated
through, about 5 minutes, and serve as a side dish.

   The last one of these I had at a restaurant was stuffed with
ground beef and at least 1/2 cup of cheese, then deep-fried and
topped with even more cheese. This version shows that a little
cheese will actually go a long way _ and won't stay with you nearly
as long.
</P>
<P>
   4 Anaheim or poblano chiles (about 3/4 pound)
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces low-fat, low-sodium Monterey Jack cheese, cut into 4
long strips
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg white
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons whole-wheat pastry flour
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Toast the chiles over an open flame until the skins are lightly
charred. Transfer to a paper or plastic bag and let rest for 10
minutes. (Alternately, roast the chiles in a baking pan in a
preheated 400 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until the skins
begin to pull away from the peppers.)
</P>
<P>
   Remove the skin to just below the stem of each chile. Make a
2-inch slit lengthwise in each chile and remove the seeds.
Carefully insert one cheese strip in each chile. Using an electric
mixer set on medium-high speed, beat the egg white until doubled in
volume. Beat in the whole egg, garlic, oregano and salt until the
mixture again doubles in volume or reaches soft peaks. Sprinkle the
flour on a plate and dredge the chiles in the flour to coat all
sides.

 &HT;    The lighter side of Tex-Mex
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TECATE, Mexico _ It's my first day at Rancho La Puerta fitness
spa, and I've huffed my way up the mountain, pumped my way through
an upper body weightlifting routine and held the warrior yoga pose
for what seemed like eter-
</P>
<P>
   nity. And it's only noon.
</P>
<P>
   Bring on the cottage cheese lunch plate. I mean to get lean.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. Is that a quesadilla they're putting on my plate?
</P>
<P>
   No, it couldn't be. Didn't the Center for Science in the Public
Interest in Washington say a few years back the average restaurant
quesadilla with all the toppings has the same amount of saturated
fat as three Quarter Pounders at McDonald's?
</P>
<P>
   Not when chef Bill Wavrin makes them. After all, each week he
oversees the preparation of three meals a day for 150 guests at
``the ranch,'' where the overall diet contains no more than 18
percent fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can't believe I'm talking about spa cuisine when I tell
them our most popular dishes are quesadillas and chiles rellenos,''
says Wavrin.
</P>
<P>
   If your New Year's resolution included eating healthy and losing
weight, you probably put Tex-Mex food on the ``red light'' list. No
more nachos nuked in the microwave. No more Friday lunches at the
cantina with the gang from work.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone knows today's deprivation is likely to be
tomorrow's binge. So we have a better plan. Go ahead and dine on
some favorites, such as guacamole and enchiladas, but use lighter
recipes that are loaded with flavor, not fat.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can still go to your favorite Tex-Mex restaurant,
but remember to take your iron will with you. ``They are probably
one of the most troublesome types of restaurants for people to stay
in control,'' said Page Love, an Atlanta nutritionist and
spokeswoman for the Georgia Dietetic Association. ``It starts with
the chip basket, where often each chip has a gram of fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled by the taco salad. With a fried shell, ground
beef, sour cream, cheese and avocado, many come in at 1,000
calories. And above all, watch your portions. A beef burrito the
size of a brick can have 800 calories or more.
</P>
<P>
   The best bet for negotiating the local cantina is to go with
soft flour and corn tortillas and salsa as an appetizer instead of
fried chips, cheese dip and guacamole. And Love suggests staying
away from the fried items, such as chiles rellenos, and steering
toward fajitas or soft tacos without the sour cream and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who simply can't stop themselves when a basket of
fresh, hot chips is plopped before them, it may be a better idea to
satisfy your Tex-Mex taste buds at home for a while. Cut some flour
tortillas into wedges and bake until crispy, or put wedges of corn
tortillas in the microwave until crisp for a quick, healthy chip
fix. Dip into salsa, which is usually fat free, or try our recipes
for low-fat guacamole and cheese dip.
</P>
<P>
   The guacamole comes from Wavrin, who's fooled many a
sophisticated spa guest into thinking they are indulging when he
offers it at special events. Truth is, his version has about half
the fat of regular guacamole.
</P>
<P>
   Wavrin's trick for quesadillas is to use small amounts of
cheeses with strong flavors, such as feta and blue cheese, along
with part-skim mozzarella. Grilled vegetables and corn make good
fillers, too. Garnishes are salsa and cilantro. They are served in
wedges, usually as a side to soup. Three wedges, or the equivalent
of a whole tortilla folded over, come in at around 180 calories and
only 6 grams of fat.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of low-fat, largely vegetarian cooking didn't come
naturally to Wavrin. He grew up on a cattle ranch and was trained
as a chef in the classic butter-and-cream French tradition.
</P>
<P>
   But during his six years as La Puerta's chef, he's mastered a
number of dishes to satisfy the health-conscious guest with
discriminating taste. Many of the recipes are in the ``Rancho La
Puerta Cookbook'' (Broadway Books, $20).
</P>
<P>
   We found some great ideas from other sources, too, proving that
cookbook folks know the appeal of Tex-Mex cuisine. For the makings
of a Tex-Mex fiesta for a fraction of the fat, see the recipes
inside. There are slow-cooked shredded beef tacos, cheese
enchiladas and unbelievably light chiles rellenos, all sure to fit
in with most diet plans.
</P>
<P>
   Now if someone would just invent a low-cal margarita. . . .

WRESTING STAR SHAWN MICHAELS RECOVERING FROM SURGERY

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ World Wrestling Federation superstar Shawn
Michaels is recovering from back surgery at a San Antonio hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons fused the wrestler's fourth and fifth vertebrae, said
Clyde McCormick, Michaels' attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult and it took a lot longer than we
expected, but he's doing very well,'' said Pablo Vasquez, one of
the physicians who operated on Michaels.
</P>
<P>
   The popular wrestler was resting comfortably after four hours of
surgery on Tuesday and will probably leave the hospital this
weekend, Vasquez said.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels, 33, known as ``The Heartbreak Kid,'' suffered a
serious back injury last year when The Undertaker tossed him
through a table during a match.
</P>
<P>
   He won the WWF's championship in 1996, and lost it a few months
later to Sycho Sid after Sid decked him with a television camera.
</P>
<P>
   To the delight of his fans, Michaels regained the championship
in January 1997 after a grueling, 17-minute grudge match at the
Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Michaels announced his retirement but said he would
continue to work as a WWF commissioner and with community groups.
</P>
<P>
   He also says he plans to open a wrestling school in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez said any return to the ring by Michaels would put too
much pressure on his spinal column.

IN THE LAND OF THE EURO, THE FRENCH FUME

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS _ What's in a name? Plenty when it comes to Europe's
new single currency.
</P>
<P>
   The euro, which on Jan. 1 became the currency for 11 European
Union countries, was hailed by officials here, the EU capital, as
the crowning achievement of a campaign for European integration.
</P>
<P>
   But the euro has also served to highlight the cultural and
linguistic differences across the continent that make problematic
the creation of a political and economic bloc to rival the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The French are angriest over the designation of the new economic
union as ``Euroland.'' They consider this use of an English word as
an insult, particularly because Britain is one of three countries
that chose not to participate in the euro launch. Greece wanted to
join but could not reduce its debt and inflation levels enough to
qualify, while the British, Swedes and Danes decided it was a
foolhardy surrender of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   French purists are incensed by what they consider yet another
Anglicization, a process aided and abetted in this instance by the
European Union. If French is the language of diplomacy, English has
become the language of finance. This fact is especially galling to
the Gauls.
</P>
<P>
   Former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing was among those
who vociferously denounced the term ``Euroland,'' first coined by
American bankers and adopted by European Union officials because
they think it sounds hip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a horrible expression, an Anglo-Saxon expression of
denigration,'' opined the former president, in French.
</P>
<P>
   Herve Lavenir de Buffon, president of the International
Committee for French as a European Language, was even more
strident, suggesting that adopting Euroland was an act of ``cheap
Americanization and treason against Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The august Academie Francaise formally ruled last week in Paris
that ``Euroland'' is a non-non. ``The Academy advises against the
use of `Euroland' because it is not the name of a sovereign state
or even a confederation, but simply the area of application of a
treaty,'' concluded the academy, which is the official guardian of
Gallic culture, in a communique. ``One never speaks of dollar-land
or sterling-land but of the dollar zone and the sterling zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy recommended calling the bloc the ``euro zone,''
pointing out that this is the term used by the Bank of France.
</P>
<P>
   But by joining the single currency, the Bank of France and the
10 other central banks in Euroland have become largely irrelevant.
Monetary policy for the bloc is set by the new European Central
Bank in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Other French institutions, including leading newspapers such as
Liberation, have taken to adding an ``e'' to the end of Euroland to
make it look more like the spellings of Ireland and Finland, which
are Irlande and Finlande in French. But as some Eurocrats here
point out, ``lande'' in French means open, uncultivated land.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking privately over dinner at an impeccable French
restaurant called La Maison du Cygne here on the Grand Place, one
European Union official said he was reluctant to arm those opposed
to the single currency with such a propaganda coup as the word
Eurolande.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be calling this the euro desert,'' he said.

THE HAZELNUT DESERVES A LITTLE RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The flavor of hazelnuts seems to be in
everything, from coffee to ice cream, yet you could count America's
per-capita consumption of these little heart-shaped nuts on one
hand. Actually, on two fingers.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, for all its popularity, Americans only eat two
hazelnuts per person, per year, according to the Hazelnut Marketing
Board. Most of the hazelnut-flavored products on the market in
America are just that, flavored, not made from real nuts. It's a
situation growers like Peter McDonald would like to see change.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's farm is in Oregon's Willamette Valley, where 99
percent of the hazelnuts _ or, filberts, as some call them _ grown
in America are produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joke is that we grow filberts and sell hazelnuts,''
McDonald said, standing in a grove of hazelnut trees last summer.
``There really isn't a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the sun shines brightly, the floor of the grove is
bathed in shadow. About 30 feet above, the branches of the
multitrunked trees form a thick canopy. From eye level, you can't
tell that there are nuts up there, much less what type they are.
Much like a chestnut, the smaller hazelnut develops in a husk that
dries and splits when the nut is mature. The trees start producing
when they are 4 years old and will keep producing indefinitely,
McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   The gray dirt below is as smooth as a ballroom dance floor and
devoid of litter, for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't pick the nuts, or shake them from the trees because
the branches are too fragile,'' McDonald said. To harvest, ``we
wait until they drop and vacuum them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Any divot larger than half an inch across will prevent a nut
from being harvested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drop'' happens each year in late September or early
October and, in a good year, each acre of trees can produce about
two tons of nuts. The 1997 harvest is the largest to date, with
Oregon farmers producing more than 45,000 tons. Unfortunately, it's
a cyclical crop, large one year and low the next; 1998 brought a
harvest of only 15,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, from one-fifth to one-third of the hazelnuts grown in
America are exported to Europe, with Germans buying the largest
share. Unlike peanut-loving Americans, the average German eats
about 200 hazelnuts annually, McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   So what is it that the Germans know that we don't? Well, there's
the medicinal folklore. Somewhere around the year 20, Dioscorides,
the first pharmacist, wrote in his ``De Materia Medica'' (``On
Medical Matters''), when pounded and eaten with honey, a filbert
will cure chronic coughing. And then there was the part about
mashing burnt filbert shells in suet and smearing the mixture on
bald heads to make hair come again.
</P>
<P>
   Today's consumers have even better reasons to use hazelnuts.
They contain fewer calories per ounce than either walnuts or pecans
and, although hazelnuts have nearly the same amount of total fat as
other nuts, they have a much higher ratio of unsaturated fat to
saturated fat. For instance, hazelnut oil is 88 percent unsaturated
fat and only 7.4 percent saturated fat, according to the Department
of Agriculture. Whereas peanut oil is 78 percent unsaturated fat
and 16 percent saturated fat. In fact, of the 15 oils listed by the
USDA, only canola oil contains less saturated fat than hazelnut
oil.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one ounce of hazelnuts supplies 75 percent of the
recommended daily intake of vitamin E, 31 percent of the
recommended daily intake of vitamin B6 and 18 percent of the
recommended daily intake of folic acid.
</P>

MUSLIM RAGE IN SOUTH AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Five days after he was shot in the head by a
policeman's rubber bullet, Yusuf Jacobs, a recent convert to Islam,
Tuesday became to many Muslims here the first martyr in a deadly
confrontation between South African security forces and radicals
suspected of sowing domestic terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of angry Muslims marched in a long funeral procession
in Cape Town Tuesday, shouting inflammatory slogans _ ``One Police,
One Bullet'' _ and firing weapons. Addressing mourners gathered in
a township stadium, the radical leader Abdulsalaam Ibrahim issued a
battle cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say to the police and the military, `You have declared war
on innocent people.' We need to arm ourselves because they are
killing defenseless people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, 22, was hit on Friday during a Muslim protest in Cape
Town against Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, who was
visiting, and the recent US-British airstrikes in Iraq. The rally
was illegal, prompting police response. But Islamic militants vowed
to retaliate by ``making the country ungovernable'' if Jacobs died.
</P>
<P>
   It was not an idle threat. Cape Town was shaken by 1,137 violent
attacks last year, including more than 80 bombings. The new year
opened with a car exploding on the city's waterfront _ a tourist
center. Police suspect Ibrahim's group _ People Against Gangsterism
and Drugs (PAGAD) _ is behind the violence.
</P>
<P>
   The government, directed by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki,
Tuesday launched an ambitious initiative making the crisis in Cape
Town its top national security priority. Called Operation Good
Hope, the plan devotes $67,000 per month to increase national
intelligence and police structures in the city and its surrounding
suburbs and townships. Security officials have also asked President
Nelson Mandela to open a probe into Jacob's death in an effort to
defuse anger against the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government will act against anybody who either propagates
or attempts to instigate any acts of violence,'' said Sydney
Mufamadi, minister of safety and security.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the crisis in Cape Town is a clash between the
police and a discontented minority. Western Cape Province has the
highest density of Muslims in South Africa, numbering about
500,000. Most are packed into the impoverished townships on the
outskirts of Cape Town. Illegal drugs _ prolific in those
neighborhoods for decades _ have fueled violence among
predominantly Muslim gangs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, in reaction to the rising criminal activity afflicting
the townships, civic leaders banded together and created PAGAD.
Initially, it was a secular response, a frustrated community's
attempt to take back its streets. The group enjoyed early support
among people who believed the police were standing idly by while
their children killed one another.
</P>
<P>
   But PAGAD soon turned into a vehicle for radical Islamic
elements, and their broadening target range of vigilante attacks
exposed the deep levels of political discontent and religious
ferment running through the Cape Muslim community. The group _ to
which Jacobs belonged _ started by bombing the homes of drug
dealers and killing gang leaders. Last year it turned against
Muslim businessmen, politicians, and mainstream clerics. The group
is suspected in the explosion of a Planet Hollywood restaurant in
August.
</P>
<P>
   ``PAGAD has organic roots in a community that over two decades
became destabilized through drug abuse and the resulting domino
effect of crime,'' said Shamil Jeppie, a University of Cape Town
historian. ``But that is a naive understanding of the problem.
There is a clash of visions about what Islam is and how it should
work within democratic law.''
</P>
<P>
   Active during the struggle to liberate South Africa from
apartheid, many Muslims have become disillusioned by democracy. The
new constitution ensured liberal freedoms anathema to Islam. The
Truth and Reconciliation Commission let murders buy their freedom,
they said, with half-truths. The police force, still manned by
old-guard apartheid officers, did not protect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, marginal Muslim groups determined that the
struggle should continue,'' said Rashied Omar, imam of the
Claremont Main Road Mosque in a suburb of Cape Town. Groups like
PAGAD, and more recent offshoots, have taken up arms against
government officials and moderate Muslims alike.
</P>
<P>
   Internecine religious strife aside, the police and politicians
have given their critics cause. Law enforcement has a difficult
record to defend. There was not a single conviction tied to the
1,137 violent attacks last year. Police have yet to bring a case in
the Planet Hollywood blast. In a blatant mockery of their efficacy,
the city's largest police stations were hit by armed robbers last
week.
</P>
<P>
   In their defense, police officials say they believe the violence
is being carried out by a small cell of people, and that building a
case against them is extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The Cape is also caught in a competitive game between two rigid
political rivals: the ruling African National Congress and its
apartheid foe, now called the New National Party. The Western Cape
is the only region governed at the provincial level by the NNP.
Mbeki wants it back, and underscored that point on Saturday at a
rally marking the 87th anniversary of the ANC. Celebrating in the
township of Athlone, a central turf in the Muslim conflict, the
deputy president urged people in the Cape to back his party in the
upcoming national elections in May.
</P>
<P>
   He also issued the call for a new police strategy in the Cape _
a move that, in an election year, looks political even if governed
by higher motives.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, false bomb threats forced evacuations in a shopping
mall, the central post office, and a restaurant Tuesday, and the
police are taking special precautions until the furor over Jacob's
death recedes. Members of the South African National Defense Forces
are patrolling Cape Town's waterfront undercover. Road blocks and
weapons searches have been set up at various points throughout the
city. And Operation Good Hope, devised in just days, is already
being implemented.

MEXICO TURNS TO WELFARE TO AID POOREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ While the United States is dismantling welfare,
Mexico is building such benefits for its poorest families.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 17 months, the administration of President Ernesto
Zedillo has quietly implemented a sweeping antipoverty initiative
that gives cash benefits directly to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The welfare program _ dubbed ``Progresa,'' or ``Progress'' _ is
a dramatic and controversial departure in Mexican social policy,
which for decades has largely consisted of providing food and other
basic services through government-funded subsidies or price
controls.
</P>
<P>
   But those projects have mostly failed to stop the country's
growing poverty, which now affects around 40 percent of the
population despite years of economic growth and a half-decade of
free trade with the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving cash benefits to the poor has been one of the most
difficult things to convince people of,'' said Santiago Levy, a
former Boston University economics professor who is now Mexico's
deputy finance minister and Progresa's chief architect. ``But we're
finding that the idea is more efficient and that the money is being
fairly well spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2 million families have been enrolled in the program
since it began in August 1997. The administration hopes to double
that figure by 2000. And although this year's federal budget is the
most austere in modern history, Progresa's 1999 appropriation
increased 40 percent over 1998, to $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty is perhaps Mexico's most pressing and daunting problem
and can be found in nearly every corner of the country, from the
dusty shantytowns along the Rio Grande to the remote jungle
enclaves in the southern state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   By most estimates, roughly 40 percent of the country's 97
million people live in poverty. That is more than the 29 percent
who lived in poverty a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today, extreme poverty hounds 25 percent of the country's
residents, most experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Progresa is as controversial as it is radical. Critics of the
sudden shift to welfare say the plan serves only the most needy at
the expense of the moderate poor, reducing or ending subsidies and
discount prices on a variety of staple foods.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore their argument, Progresa opponents point to
tortillas, the nation's most important food product. Days after the
government lifted price controls on tortillas on Jan. 1, the cost
of a 2-pound stack rose from about 30 cents to as high as 50 cents.
On Wednesday, the government pressured tortilla makers to limit
prices to about 35 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Progresa critics offer other reasons why the idea does more harm
than good: it favors the rural poor over the urban poor; it does
not do enough to lift families out of poverty through job training;
and it is too small to have any real impact on the country's
widespread problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a philosophy driving this that says you can give cash
to the poor but you won't help them up the income ladder,'' said
Denise Dresser, a political scientist at Mexico's Autonomous
Technological Institute. ``It's a message that doesn't offer much
hope for the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift to welfare underscores a change in the Zedillo
administration's emphasis to serving mostly rural poor, who make up
60 percent of Mexicans who live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, under the old system, nearly 69 percent of
federal antipoverty funds went to low-income urban residents,
according to government budget documents. With the expansion of
Progresa this year, the administration expects that rural
communities will receive 76 percent of assistance dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Progresa identifies eligible families from interviews conducted
mostly in rural towns and villages. To qualify, a family has to
keep two promises: that their children will stay in school and that
they will get regular medical checkups. Every month, caseworkers
review class attendance sheets and clinical records.
</P>
<P>
   If the family complies, it receives an average cash benefit
every two months of about $50. The amount increases for every
additional year each child remains in school _ what officials refer
to as ``scholarships.''
</P>
<P>
   Another trait that distinguishes Progresa from other assistance
programs in Mexico is its emphasis on women: Only the mother can
receive the family's benefits because experts say they think she
would handle the money more responsibly than the father, and
scholarships are higher for girls who stay in school than they are
for boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a program that makes a pact with families who have
been the principal buffer against our volatile economic
situtation,'' said Jose Gomez Leon, a Harvard-trained economist who
is Progresa's director. ``And it does it by integrating assistance
with health and education.''
</P>
<P>
   By scrapping the old programs _ nearly all of which were created
by Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has
controlled presidential power in Mexico for the past 80 years _
Zedillo appears to be distinguishing himself from his predecessors,
especially Carlos Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   A free-market proponent who is credited with winning approval
for the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, Salinas
created his own public works and social investment project called
``Solidarity.'' By 1994, however, the initiative was riddled with
accusations of corruption and that its main beneficiaries were
local party bosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Solidarity) sent money to the community level, but that left
it open to influence by political leaders who ruined the program,''
said one top administration aide. ``What we want to do is bring the
benefits directly to the family level.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Progresa sparked fierce debates within the government
between those who favored a cash-based welfare system and those who
worried about the chaos that would follow if subsidies were
removed. Zedillo settled the dispute by siding with Levy and Gomez
and approving Progresa, which has received praise from
international organizations such as the World Bank and the
Inter-American Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Progresa reaches its goal of aiding 4 million families,
it remains unclear how long welfare will last here, too. Zedillo's
term ends in 2000, and no one guarantees that the next president
will keep the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is for us to keep this progam from being
identified as a political operation,'' said Levy. ``If we can stick
by the rules and make sure the families are sticking with their
promises, then there will be no reason to change it. But it must
remain society's program.''

NIGHTMARE ON WALL STREET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They said it could not possibly happen again.
</P>
<P>
   But in the first week after the calendar flipped to 1999, the
Dow Jones industrial average twice set new records, coming within
shouting distance of that once-implausible 10,000 mark and imbuing
investors with renewed hopes of the untold riches yet to be reaped.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow has not only bounced back from a 512-point, one-day dive
in August but has done so while one-third of the world has been
mired in recession. Americans are spending like there's no
tomorrow, and Wall Street is predicting the economy will continue
to expand. Nothing can stop it!
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an optimism in the air _ a feeling a new wave is
coming with the euro and the millennium and all the rest,'' said
Jeremy Siegel, a finance professor at the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a new wave. Or it may, just suppose, be insanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the laws of nature have been repealed,'' said Barton
Biggs of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in a 1999 outlook report,
``bust still follows boom, and bear markets follow bull markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth about the market's future no doubt lies between the
doomsday forecasts of bears, like Biggs, who have crawled out of
their Wall Street dens, and the mania that has infected
Internet-stock buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, as the Dow last week added 461 points _ 5 percent
_ in its march toward Friday's record close of 9,643.32, it was not
difficult to find market analysts and economists willing to
indulge, albeit briefly, in their worst nightmares about 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Although none would predict a market collapse while the United
States is still in the midst of its longest peacetime expansion
ever, they did reveal what keeps them awake at night. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A junky bull market &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock market index posted a snappy
26.7 percent gain last year. Peel back the surface, and the picture
is not so pretty: The 10 best-performing stocks in the index
produced a remarkable 41 percent of that gain.
</P>
<P>
   In healthier bull markets, ``the soldiers _ the broader market _
support the generals,'' explained Marshall Acuff, equity strategist
for Salomon Smith Barney. ``In 1998, the soldiers ran away from the
field and left the generals to fight the battle by themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ``generals'' were technology giants: Microsoft
Corp., Dell Computer Corp., MCI WorldCom Inc., IBM Corp., Intel
Corp., Lucent Technologies Inc., Cisco Systems Inc., as well as
General Electric Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc., and Pfizer Inc. Of
the Top 10, all but four doubled last year. Dell's stock more than
tripled, and Lucent's nearly did.
</P>
<P>
   Blue chip companies propelled all markets last year. For
example, although the technology-heavy Nasdaq index rose 40 percent
last year, Acuff said, the average stock in Nasdaq was actually
down 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A market built on such a narrow foundation is what worries
analysts about 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a healthy thing,'' he said. ``The best-quality
bull markets are ones that rise on solid breadth.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Up and out &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the current market, analysts said, is the high
price of many stocks when compared to their per-share earnings.
</P>
<P>
   This ``price/earnings ratio'' has spiraled to record highs.
According to calculations by Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, a Lexington
research firm, the P/E ratio is currently at a record 33.8 times
earnings _ up from 28 times earnings last fall. At its low in 1980,
the market's P/E was just 7 times earnings. That was at the end of
the 1970s bear market, the longest in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me nervous,'' said economist David Wyss at S&AMP;P DRI,
who wonders how today's lofty prices can be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   As troubling, he said, is the market's accelerated pace. After
the 1987 crash, it took two years to return to pre-crash levels.
After the August 1998 plunge, the recovery period was only four
months _ ``the world's shortest correction,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Internet intensity &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although analysts generally avoid using ``bubble'' to describe
the market overall, it is the first word on their lips to describe
Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The combined market value of publicly traded Internet stocks is
currently about $250 billion _ about the size of the Hong Kong
stock market. Yet most Internet companies did not turn a dime of
profit last year.
</P>
<P>
   Take Broadcast.com. The Dallas-based company's stock shot up
from 80 a share at mid-week to nearly 230 after its executives told
stock analysts about a plan to disseminate earnings conference
calls by public companies over the Internet. After Nasdaq officials
on Friday temporarily halted trading in the stock it settled at 197
1/2 at week's end.
</P>
<P>
   The most successful among the Internet-related companies _
America Online Inc. (145 a share); Amazon.com Inc. (160 1/4); and
Yahoo Inc. (343 5/8) _ have combined yearly sales of $3.5 billion.
But their aggregate value in the stock market is out of this world,
at 40 times sales, said Ned Riley, chief investment officer for
BankBoston Corp. Compare it, he said, to the S&AMP;P 500, which is
worth twice its yearly sales.
</P>
<P>
   This ``doesn't matter'' to investors, Riley said, ``because
there's another fool out there buying at a higher price, and this
speculative bubble keeps expanding and expanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts' unspoken fear: If the Internet bubble pops, it could
jeopardize the entire market in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The great profits debate &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Economist say markets rise for essentially two reasons: Low
interest rates or strong corporate profits. When interest rates are
low, money is cheap, encouraging companies to invest and consumers
to spend. Low bond yields also make investors eager to pour money
into stocks, further driving up share prices.
</P>
<P>
   But in forecasting the stock market in 1999, economists can't
seem to agree on whether corporate America will make more money
this year or less. In an annual survey of analysts forecasting the
new year, First Call Corp. said Wall Street expects 18.5 percent
growth in 1999 profits. No one believes this _ not even First Call,
which said 18.5 percent was ``on the optimistic side.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, profits last year grew just 3.2 percent. More
bleak were operating profits _ profits minus one-time gains and
losses. By the end of the third quarter of 1998, operating profits
had been in decline during most of the seven quarters, according to
Charles Clough, chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
As companies' profits fell, their debt swelled by $350 billion last
year _ much more than it did during the leveraged buyout boom of
1988, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Profits, Clough predicted, ``will go down well into the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The wealth squelch &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that the consumer spending craze appears to be the
only engine keeping the economy going. Consumers are riding high,
and companies are obliging them: Two dozen new sport utility
vehicles were introduced last year in the United States, including
offerings by Mercedez Benz and BMW. Spending is being financed by
unprecedented gains in stock portfolios, which make consumers feel
rich, so rich that they have quit saving money: The savings rate
actually went into negative territory for part of last year for the
first time in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Although retailers report they had a good holiday shopping
season, the party may be over. Consumers ``are spending more than
what is sustainable,'' said Robert Brusca, chief economist in the
New York office of Nikko Securities Co.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the stock market? ``The image you get is of Wile
E. Coyote having stepped off a mesa but still smiling because he
hasn't looked down yet,'' Brusca said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The world is a mess &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   True, Asian stock markets are rallying. Hong Kong's market rose
6 percent last week; South Korea's, 11 percent; Indonesia's 10
percent. The cascading currency crises of the summer _ which
triggered Russia's economic collapse and the Dow's plunge in August
_ have abated.
</P>
<P>
   But the heart of Asia's economy, Japan, is still a mess. Its
financial system is sucking wind _ and carrying about $700 billion
in bad loans. Said Acuff, who traveled to Tokyo twice last month,
``people there ask you what can we do to make this better. There's
a loss of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Tokyo's whirlpool doesn't pull down the US market,
pessimists fear another international shock might. The prime
candidate: Brazil, which last week delayed payments of government
debt and is facing possible recession and currency devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``World growth is still slowing. Europe is probably getting
weaker, rather than stronger. Japan's not going anywhere and Latin
America's getting weaker,'' said Robert Mellman, senior economist
for J.P. Morgan in New York, who is also pessimistic about US
profits.
</P>
<P>
   So, why does the market keep going up? ``It's hard to know where
it's coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   But indulgence in such dark scenarios is futile, because they
could certainly prove to be wrong. The Dow and the S&AMP;P 500 in 1999
very well may post double-digit gains again _ for a fifth year in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   Stranger things have happened.

WHY BOTHA? GOOD QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Francois Botha knows most people would agree with
the opinion of Ron Stander's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Stander was a club fighter who somehow found himself
in the ring with Joe Frazier one night. After Frazier was done
beating Stander half to death, his wife was asked what she thought
of the mess her husband had become. She said, somehwat irked, ``I
told him you don't enter a Volkswagen in the Indianapolis 500.''
</P>
<P>
   Botha is considered the Volkswagen in Saturday's fistic race
with Mike Tyson at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, but this will be no
Indy 500. If the experts are correct, Botha-Tyson will be a
demolition derby, one in which the Volkswagen is widely expected to
collide head-on with a Ford Suburban.
</P>
<P>
   The former International Boxing Federation champion has done his
best to ignore such talk, but it is all around him. Wherever he
goes in Las Vegas, Botha hears that he is a 6-1 underdog but should
be 60-1. He hears how fearsome this latest incarnation of Tyson
appears after a 17-month layoff. He hears this is the unbeatable
Tyson again. The old Tyson. The intimidating Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Botha hears all this and tries to ignore it, because what else
can he do when a $1.8 million payday lies just three nights and one
probable beating away?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyson always had the intimidation factor,'' conceded Botha
(39-1, 24 KOs). ``So it's the opponent that counts. The guys he
fought like Frank Bruno and Bruce Seldon were scared. They lost the
fights before they got in the ring. I can't be intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he can't, but one sentence later Botha is saying, ``I
still think that Mike Tyson is the greatest heavyweight out there.
I have nothing to lose and everything to gain. If I lose, people
will say, `I told you so.' People don't expect anything of me.
People still see Tyson as the baddest man out there. That's going
to make my victory that much bigger. I'm not another Peter
McNeeley.''
</P>
<P>
   McNeeley, of course, lasted only 89 seconds with Tyson under
similar circumtances, so that's not saying much. Tyson was coming
off 3 1/2 years in prison that night and chose to fight a guy who
had never been in with anyone of note. This time he is coming off a
briefer exile for biting Evander Holyfield's ears and has chosen to
fight a former world champion, even if that championship was won
under a cloud because Botha tested positive for steroids after
winning a decision from Axel Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if one looks carefully at Botha's record, the victims list
is not much different from the one McNeeley carried with him into
this same Grand Garden Arena: Lee Gilbert, Tim Tomashek, David
Cherry, Willie Jake, Brian Sargent, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The only difference is the presence of two-time heavyweight
champion Michael Moorer and Schulz on Botha's list, but he lost a
desultory decision to the former and won the IBF title from the
latter without winning the fight, which was ruled a no-contest
after the drug test. So if Botha is not another Volkswagen or
another McNeeley what is he? A Yugo?
</P>
<P>
   ``I made same huge mistakes that night against Moorer,'' Botha
insisted. ``I'm a more mature fighter now. Most of the public
thinks I'm another Peter McNeeley. They think, `This guy is another
sacrificial lamb.' But I believe strongly in myself. I really don't
care what Mike Tyson thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a good, thing because here's what Tyson thinks of
Francois ``VW'' Botha, at the moment:
</P>
<P>
   Q. ``What do you expect Botha to do when you come right at
him?''
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Die.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might call that hyperbole. Others might think Tyson is
taking Botha a tad lightly. A few would conclude that Tyson simply
agrees with Mrs. Stander and chose to answer with a burst of
honesty.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Botha clings to the one straw out there for
all opponents of the two-time heavyweight champion: Evander
Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did the same thing with Evander Holyfield,'' Botha said.
``He didn't have any respect for Evander Holyfield before their
first fight. After the fight, he asked to shake Holyfield's hand.
He'll respect me after Jan. 16. This is the kind of fight that most
heavyweights wait for. It can put you up where you belong.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knock out Tyson, I will be the biggest thing in boxing. I
believe they bit off more than they can chew with Francois Botha.
No pun intended.''
</P>
<P>
   If they did, it's news to Tyson, his handlers, and local
bookmakers. In a world Botha believes is clamoring for the next
Great White Hope, he knows he is being seen as the Great White Nope
by the multitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with three days to go, he still believes. With three days to
go, he is still unafraid. With three days to go, he still thinks he
is what the world wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``People all over are crying for a white heavyweight champion,''
Botha said. ``In fact, many black people have come up to me many
times offering their support. Blacks and whites are crying for a
white heavyweight.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night they may have good reason to, as Mrs. Ron Stander
well knows.

WHEN TRAFFIC STOPS, POOR GO TO WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ It happens about any time of day at busy
intersections throughout this capital metropolis. Once the traffic
light turns red, the carnival begins.
</P>
<P>
   A man with a clown's exaggerated smile painted on his face
climbs a ladder and eats fire while his small children collect
pesos from waiting motorists.
</P>
<P>
   A woman in a white, soot-stained skirt sells straightened
doughnuts called ``churros.'' Young boys dart between cars offering
30-second windshield washings. The young and old peddle everything
from chewing gum to crayons to seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sign of the times in this cash- and job-strapped
economy, where millions of ordinary Mexicans must make ends meet
any way and anywhere they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is hard work and I know it's not good for my health, but
there's nothing else I can do,'' said Mario Fernandez, a
69-year-old fire-eater, who works an east-side street corner.
</P>
<P>
   On a good day, Fernandez said, he can make up to $10 in tips
from drivers, nearly triple the $3.40 daily minimum wage. But to
earn that, he repeatedly thrusts flaming gasoline-soaked swabs into
his mouth from 7 a.m. until sunset, six days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drink lots of milk to coat my mouth and throat,'' he added,
in a hoarse voice.
</P>
<P>
   Years of economic growth have opened government-controlled
industries to private competition, fueled by capital from
multinational corporations and bullish investors.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the country's new wealth has yet to reach the
swollen ranks of the poor. And new price hikes on basics from
tortillas to electricity may worsen the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rapid population growth is one way of explaining Mexico's
poverty, but it's not the complete answer,'' said Yolanda Moreno,
an economic consultant in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a new welfare program by President Ernesto Zedillo,
millions of Mexicans are not covered, and must make ends meet with
unusual tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Some walk around dressed as ostriches or other outrageous
costumes to get a laugh and a peso out of spectators. Others spread
blankets on sidewalks and sell old shoes, used watches, and faded
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Rodriguez Cardoso and his family guard Monte Stanovoi
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a damp red rag and a plastic bucket filled with soapy
water, the Rodriguez family earns about $140 a month washing and
protecting the cars that are parked on this affluent block.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes my wife washes dishes or sweeps over there,''
Rodriguez said, pointing to the Chinese Embassy on the corner.
``We're still enjoying the extra money we got during Christmas, so
we're not feeling the higher prices yet. But we will soon, I know
it.''

A VEHICLE TO THE AMERICAN DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yellow school bus. Orange city bus. Bright beacons, great,
glowing chariots chugging me to class. Some people just cannot
understand how I could see buses in this light. Many writers are on
a scorched-bus campaign, rewriting school busing into one of the
greatest wastes and social evils of the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The revisionists fool no one. They blame elitist, liberal
judges. They exhume 20-year-old polls to say, ``See, see, the
blacks didn't like busing either!'' These tactics give white
critics the license to torch busing without appearing to immolate
educational opportunity for African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   This week, busing was news again as Boston Mayor Thomas M.
Menino pledged five new neighborhood schools. The Globe said this
could signal the end of busing. Menino said he wanted parents to
have ``the choice of where to send their child to school. Parents
should make that decision. Not the politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   African-American parents know that buildings and ``choice'' mean
nothing when only five of the city's 75 elementary schools send
significant numbers of students to Latin. For Menino to go from
rhetoric to reality, he must remember what the revisionists
insidiously forget. The issue is not neighborhood schools. It is
the quality denied to black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   I called my mother to ask her why she put me on a school bus in
the second grade in Milwaukee to go to a school a mile away from my
neighborhood school. In the fifth grade she put me in an
accelerated program, which meant that from that point through high
school graduation, I would take the city bus to schools between 4
and 8 miles away from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't regret it at all,'' my mother, Doris Jackson, told me.
``I never gave it a second thought. Your little mouth was working
overtime. I knew you were not going to get what you needed in the
schools around here.''
</P>
<P>
   My mother did not use the buzz phrases of the '90s, like
``parent involvement,'' ``teacher-student ratios,'' or
``resources.'' She judged my neighborhood school with her eyes. The
school had served me fine in kindergarten and first grade in 1960
and 1961. I still feel the hug of first-grade teacher Ms.
Vanderkelen, who told me I did a great job even though my Marine
Corps hat fell off on stage during a Veterans Day program.
</P>
<P>
   But we lived in a neighborhood that went predominantly white to
predominantly African-American almost overnight. Parents could feel
resources and caring teachers leaving the local school with the
force of a gust blowing an umbrella inside out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing some of the teachers and hearing them talk, you could
tell that the quality was going way down,'' my mother said. ``You
could look around the school and see if the kids were at their
desks. If they were running around, going to the bathroom and not
going right back to class, that was not good.''
</P>
<P>
   From age 7 until 16, I spent one to two hours a day on the bus,
not to mention the sloshing, sliding, and freezing the half-mile to
and from the bus stop. Like my mother, I have absolutely no regret
except for watching how my neighborhood friends got the shaft
merely for staying close to home. Their textbooks were five to 10
years older than mine. I went on field trips to Madison and
Chicago, to farms, fish hatcheries, and pumpkin fields. My
neighborhood friends were lucky if they went to the city museum.
</P>
<P>
   Revisionists blame busing for a brain drain that harmed black
neighborhoods. That is laughable, since no one talks about brain
drains when white families send children to prep schools. The fact
is that black folks, whether my mother or the thousands of
African-American families who have used METCO in Boston to get
their children into suburban schools, are using any means necessary
to catch what was drained out of neighborhood schools.
</P>
<P>
   This was about more than books and teachers. It was about
exposure and confidence. I was friends with the sons of furriers as
well as factory workers. I had white and black bowling partners and
partners as who talked as much science fiction as sports. The
interracial friendships taught me about individual humanity in a
racist country. The vigorous debates with white teachers taught me
how to use the library to explore and explain my African-American
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The bus carried me through neighborhoods that showed me in
subtle ways the inequities of the American Dream. I did not
understand redlining, but I did understand the lower prices for
chocolate milk and hit records. I gained so much independence that
by 17, I regularly took Greyhound to Chicago to see shows or up to
Green Bay to photograph the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to travel would come in handy in journalism. Busing
is not ideal. But until society treat schools equally, it has no
right to vilify it or any other way black parents secure a good
school. Until quality education comes back to the black
neighborhood, it makes the critics rather transparent. They hate
busing so because they know those yellow buses, those great,
glowing chariots, put a lot of black children like me on the road
to a golden life.

`PROSECUTORS' DRAW ON THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The last time Representative F. James Sensenbrenner
Jr. argued a case in court was a divorce matter in 1975. He also
questioned a witness in a 1989 impeachment trial of a federal
judge. But over the New Year's holiday, while the Wisconsin
Republican was home watching the Rose Bowl, he penned the opening
argument in what many consider the case of the century, the Senate
impeachment trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner is one of 13 House ``managers'' who will act as
prosecutors in the impeachment trial. They are all white, all men,
and all lawyers, and all are among the most conservative members of
the House.
</P>
<P>
   While the 100 senators hold Clinton's fate in their hands, they
are not allowed to speak during the trial until the deliberations.
Thus, the managers will become the focus, as they make the final
effort to convince the Senate _ and a largely skeptical public _
that Clinton should be convicted and ousted from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But to the great frustration of the managers, they are preparing
for the case of their lives without a road map. ``It would be a lot
easier if we knew the rules,'' Sensenbrenner said in a telephone
interview last week, explaining that he still did not know whether
witnesses such as former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky
would be allowed. The Senate trial compromise worked out Friday by
Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Phil Gramm of Texas
leaves the question of witnesses up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner was handpicked by House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde to deliver the opening statement Thursday
because of his ``innate brilliance,'' Hyde said in a brief
interview minutes after he delivered the articles of impeachment to
the Senate last Thursday. It also helped, aides said, that
Sensenbrenner is the second-ranking member of the committee. Hyde
is slated to deliver introductory remarks before Sensenbrenner
begins, as well as one of two closing statements.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Bill McCollum of Florida has been tapped as one
the top managers, due to his even manner and his work as a judge
advocate general in the military, a job that McCollum said is
glamorized in the television series ``JAG.''
</P>
<P>
   McCollum said he dealt with all kinds of cases in the military,
but he said, ``You can never be prepared for a case like this.''
While the House team includes a number of former prosecutors and
staff lawyers, he said, ``We all know that the White House has . .
. the most high-power law firms in town, and we are obviously
working under some severe constraints.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who served with the managers on the House Judiciary
Committee expressed doubts about their qualifications, saying many
will be perceived by the public as conservative ideologues.
Moreover, said Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts
Democrat on the committee, ``None of them have tried a case in a
very long period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Paul McNulty, a spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee,
said the managers do not have to have backgrounds as star
prosecutors to perform well. ``Of the lawyers in this country, the
list of us who have done a really big case is rather small,''
McNulty said. He noted that Sensenbrenner and Representative George
Gekas of Pennsylvania have served as managers in impeachment trials
of federal judges, and that several other managers have been
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   While all 13 managers are expected to play a part in the trial,
it is clear that a handful, including Sensenbrenner, McCollum, and
Gekas, will be most prominent. In addition, Representative James
Rogan of California is scheduled to deliver one of the closing
arguments, and Representatives Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, Lindsey
Graham of South Carolina, and Charles Canady of Florida are
expected to receive top roles.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson may be in the extraordinary position of arguing the
case before a jury of senators that includes his brother, Senator
Tim Hutchinson, also of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, at least, one of the most qualified managers is
Representative Bob Barr of Georgia, who was the first member of
Congress to call for Clinton's impeachment. Barr, US attorney for
the northern district of Georgia from 1986 to 1990, successfully
prosecuted a former Republican congressman, Patrick Swindall of
Georgia, in 1989 on charges of lying to a grand jury. An aide said
that would make Barr especially well qualified to present the case
that Clinton lied before a grand jury, one of the two impeachment
articles being prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   But some Judiciary Committee officials, speaking privately, said
Barr may be given a low profile due to concerns that he is
perceived _ fairly or not _ as too much of an ideologue. Barr is
expected to be given a role in discussing the laws governing
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, one of the expected stars is Rogan, a telegenic
former Democrat who rose to prominence as a deputy district
attorney in Los Angeles by working in the ``hard-core gang murder
unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde himself is described by associates as more of a coach of
the team than the on-floor leader, but the committee chairman
picked himself for the final arguments of the trial. After Rogan
delivers a closing statement on the facts of the case, Hyde is
slated to wrap things up by making the case for Clinton's
conviction. While there had been some speculation that Hyde's
admission last year of adultery 30 years ago would make him a poor
choice for such a role, aides said this week that Hyde sees no such
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said last week that his job was ``a little depressing,''
but he felt a ``solemnity'' about it. ``All of us wish we could get
it over with,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Baron, an attorney who acted as a House counsel in the 1989
impeachment trials of two federal judges, said he expected much of
the legal work to be done by lawyers for the Judiciary Committee.
Baron said he helped prepare the managers in the previous cases
deliver their statements and sometimes wrote a proposed set of
questions to interrogate witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You brief them, you teach them, and your job is to make them
look good,'' Baron said, referring to the managers in an
impeachment trial. Unlike a regular case, in which one person might
take the lead in prosecution, Baron said, impeachment trials
usually are divided into small pieces with each manager handling a
specific part. Baron said managers who formerly were lawyers or
prosecutors often performed well, even if they had not argued a
case in many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience of handling a witness is a major help,'' Baron
said. ``It is kind of like riding a bike. And as politicians, all
these guys are reasonably articulate and think on their feet. Some
of the political skills are not only helpful but really applicable
to their skills as managers.''

MAINE'S IMPEACHMENT PERIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine -- Maine voters like their president and like
their two female Republican senators, and they don't want Clinton
ejected from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   So if Senators Olympia Snowe or Susan Collins vote with the
conservative Sun Belt senators who want Clinton impeached, they
risk forfeiting their seat representing a state that gives low
marks to partisan politicking.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe, like two other GOP moderates from New England, Rhode
Island's John Chafee and Vermont's Jim Jeffords, faces reelection
next year. Collins is not up till 2002. Both women are pro-choice
on abortion, hew to the political center, and take pains not to be
caught posturing on national issues while seeming to ignore
bread-and-butter concerns of this largely rural state.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe seems comfortably positioned for reelection, but that
would change dramatically if she votes to remove Clinton from
office, some local experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are satisfied that Snowe and Collins will do the right
thing'' and choose to censure Clinton rather than eject him from
office, said Dr. Chris Potholm, a government professor at Bowdoin.
``Maine assumes they will vote their conscience _ that the best
thing for Snowe and Collins is to say, `OK, the House had its fun,'
but not to vote to remove him.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Maine's voters are nearly evenly divided in thirds,
Republican, Democrat, and independent, said Potholm, ``Republicans
here succeed only by appealing to conservative Democrats.'' For
Snowe to cast her lot with southern and western Republicans baying
for Clinton's scalp, she'd fracture that coalition she needs to
hold her seat for a second term.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she does, it would be because she fears a right-wing
challenge in the primary,'' reasoned Potholm, author of ``An
Insider's Guide to Maine Politics.'' Snowe, whose husband is former
governor John McKernan, would seem to have little difficulty
disposing of a right-wing primary challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe last year heeded the entreaty of Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott and at a key juncture abandoned the campaign finance
reform proposal of Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and
Russ Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin. ``If she does cave in to Lott
(on impeachment),'' concluded Potholm, ``She would anger the
suburban Democrats in the belt around Portland.''
</P>
<P>
   You've heard of bipartisan and post-partisan. Try this: Maine is
tripartisan. The two senators are Republican; the two congressmen
are Democrats (who voted against impeachment); Governor Angus King,
just reelected with 59 percent of the total vote in a four-way
race, is an independent; and both branches of the Legislature are
controlled by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't get any more tripartisan than that. Maine expects its
senators to be independent and not hidebound partisans. Margaret
Chase Smith, a Republican who humbled the venomous Joe McCarthy,
and Edmund Muskie, a centrist acceptable to all factions of the
riven Democratic party of the late '60s, were role models for
George Mitchell and Bill Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe and Collins sit in the Mitchell and Cohen seats,
relinquished by both men. The irony is that Mitchell and Cohen, one
the former Democratic majority leader, the other a Republican who
became Clinton's highly regarded secretary of defense, are both
close to the embattled president, whose fate rests partly in the
hands of the two women who succeeded Clinton's allies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton remains generally popular here. ``I think if the
president came here for a visit tomorrow, he'd be well-received,''
is the hunch of A. Jay Higgins, a political writer at the Bangor
Daily News. ``I don't sense that there's a great hue and cry for a
full impeachment proceeding against the president, as far as
Olympia's or Susan's constituents are concerned. The mood in Maine
is pretty much `enough, already!' like most other places.''
</P>
<P>
   When Patrick Murphy of Portland's Strategic Marketing Services
polled 400 Mainers last October, 71 percent wanted him to stay in
office, 25 were for impeachment. Sixty-five percent approved of
Clinton's job performance, and 71 percent disapproved of the
Republicans' handling of the impeachment drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's ratings are high,'' said Murphy. ``Most people here
want the same thing as people in the rest of the country, excluding
the South. They want him censured, but not removed from office.''
</P>
<P>
   Maine's Democratic Party chairwoman, Gwethalyn Phillips, said,
``I'm hoping they (Snowe and Collins) will do the right thing, and
decide we don't need to hear Monica and company parading across the
stage one more time.'' But if Snowe votes to impeach, she added,
``There is an opening here.'' Phillips said she knows of at least
one Democratic office-holder who'll challenge Snowe next year, but
would say which. Potholm said he believes US Representative Tom
Allen ``will run if she looks vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Governor King has said repeatedly he's not interested in going
to a talking shop in D.C., but his second term is up when Collins
has to run again, and his poll ratings are higher than hers. The
Democrat who just lost to King, Tom Connolly, got only 12 percent
of the vote and would pose little threat to Snowe. Nationally, the
GOP's impeachment drive has driven the party's image to record low
territory _ two of three voters disapprove. A vote by Snowe to
impeach would energize Democrats here like no other issue could.

THE SENATE'S BLOODIEST BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- As they gathered in the old Senate chamber in
Washington for a private bipartisan caucus last week, one senator
rose and pointed to the door through which a congressman, Preston
Brooks of South Carolina, entered on what would be the red-and-gold
room's most dramatic and bloodiest day.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, now the senior Democrat on its
rules committee and thus a curator of its lore, argued that the
caning of Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts on May 22, 1856,
foreshadowed the firing on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever civility and comity remained in the Senate in the
late 1850s ended with that event,'' he said, arguing that when
decorum disappears, greater violence can follow. Dodd did not
exaggerate. In his two-volume biography of Sumner, Harvard
historian David Herbert Donald asserts that the Brooks attack ``may
be regarded as the first blow of the Civil War.''
</P>
<P>
   Educated at Boston Latin, Harvard College, and Harvard Law
School, Sumner was handsome, brilliant, and eloquent. Like many
heroes and martyrs, he was also vain, humorless, and insensitive.
He was slow to denounce the anti-Catholicism of the Know-Nothings
and slower to support women's suffrage.
</P>
<P>
   But he became a zealous advocate for the abolition of slavery
after the Massachusets Legislature elected him to the Senate in
1851. Sumner said he was ``in morals, not politics.'' He laced his
oratory with arcane classical allusions, but not with civility or
comity. Senator Andrew Pickens Butler of South Carolina, Sumner
said, ``has chosen a mistress to whom he has made his vows. . . . I
mean the harlot, slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler was absent but his cousin, Brooks, sought revenge with
the chosen weapon of Southern chivalry, a horsewhip. ``But knowing
that the senator was my superior in strength, it occurred to me
that he might wrest it from my hand,'' Brooks said later. With the
Senate in recess, Sumner sat addressing letters. Brooks approached
him from behind, wielding an 11-ounce hardwood walking stick with a
gold head.
</P>
<P>
   He addressed Sumner, whom he had never met, and when the senator
turned around Brooks brought the cane down upon his skull. A geyser
of blood covered his face as Brooks landed more blows. The 6-foot-2
Sumner staggered to his feet, ripping his desk from the iron plates
bolting it to the floor. Brooks flailed away at his blinded victim,
shattering the stick while delivering what he called ``about 30
first-rate stripes.''
</P>
<P>
   After the five-minute attack, Sumner was stitched up and, during
a long convalescence, lionized by the antislavery forces and the
new Republican party. The abolitionist John Brown visited him to
view his bloodied coat.
</P>
<P>
   The blows that disabled Sumner also disabled the Senate, Dodd
told his colleagues last week. After the Civil War, Sumner's vanity
rose and his statesmanship vanished. In 1868, he welcomed the
impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, who, he said, ``has
triumphed in his wickedness'' and ``patronized massacre and
bloodshed and license to the Ku Klux Klan.''
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, the late political operative Lee Atwater once
told me, the birthplace of ``Bully Brooks'' was regarded as a
shrine. But Sumner's assailant died of a sudden fever at 36. After
his victim died in 1874 at 63, the Commonwealth published a
317-page memorial volume of the eulogies for Sumner, including a
53-stanza poem by John Greenleaf Whittier.
</P>
<P>
   Statues rose to him in Boston and Cambridge, but the muse of
history seldom stood as self-confidently as did Charles Sumner of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   He was like ``a cat without smellers,'' his friend, Richard
Henry Dana Jr., said. ``He has none of the delicate tests that, as
he passes along, tell him what he touches.'' In 1965, historian
Samuel Eliot Morison wrote that Sumner was ``one of those
fortunately rare and rarely fortunate persons who are not only
thick-skinned themselves but assume that everyone else is.''

A BOY'S LIFE LOST, AND TOO FEW CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is no more than a collection of body parts _ a torso, a
thigh, a shoulder, a groin. Each piece of Eric Dawood is isolated
from the whole in the color photographs that are mounted on poster
board and exhibited on an easel in Courtroom 304.
</P>
<P>
   Circles of broken blood vessels mark the spots where the punches
landed. Strips of flayed skin hint at the sting of an electrical
cord. Blotches of red and purple flesh define the points of impact
where a heavy shoe smashed into the abdomen of a 6-year-old boy,
the places where Eric Dawood's intestines ruptured and his ribs
shattered.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after this child's broken body was lowered into a
grave, Juan E. Cruz is on trial in Suffolk Superior Court in Boston
for murder. Melissa Dawood, Juan's girlfriend and Eric's mother,
testified last week that she witnessed an assault that dragged on
for days but that she failed to intervene to save her son's life.
</P>
<P>
   In the time-honored tradition of criminal defendants, Cruz
contends she, not he, inflicted the fatal blows in the apartment
they shared on Quincy Street. A jury will determine criminal
responsibility; it's left to the rest of us to consider our own.
</P>
<P>
   In a week when political discourse has been dominated by the
governor's promise to cut the income tax and the mayor's commitment
to subsidize a baseball park, the murder of Eric Dawood barely
registered.
</P>
<P>
   There are no British au pairs or beauty pageant princesses to
elevate this case of fatal child abuse to a level of political
interest. There is only a dead boy, born impoverished to a mother
whose four other children had been taken away by the Department of
Social Services because of her chronic neglect, a mother whose
choice in men culminated in Cruz, a man with a history of drug
dealing and a prison term for armed bank robbery.
</P>
<P>
   The story is so familiar we assume we can fill in the blanks,
piece together the puzzle that was Eric Dawood's life with our
preconceptions about social dysfunction, substance abuse, and the
welfare state.
</P>
<P>
   But what easy answers can explain the ``exquisite pain'' and
``the profound suffering'' that a 40-pound kindergartner must have
endured on those awful days in January 1996 when, Dr. Eli Newberger
testified Tuesday, ``massive force'' must have been used against
the recumbent, naked body of Eric Dawood to produce his fatal
injuries?
</P>
<P>
   In a study issued this week, Columbia University's Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse reported that the number of abused or
neglected children has more than doubled, from 1.4 million in 1986
to more than 3 million in 1997. Joseph A. Califano Jr., the
center's director and a former US secretary of Health, Education
and Welfare, noted that at a time of economic boom we are devoting
fewer and fewer resources to children most at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this nation,'' he said, ``we take better care of condors
than of children.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no better in Massachusetts. In the last decade the state
has enacted a dozen laws to protect vulnerable children. We now
license foster homes, require more training of foster parents, and
limit to six the number of children permitted in a single foster
home. But still, six children in foster care died last year; 10
died the year before.
</P>
<P>
   And those numbers do not include children like Eric Dawood, dead
despite their family's supervision by the state's child protection
agency.
</P>
<P>
   At the State House this week, the no-longer-acting governor made
much of the state's robust economy, vowing to spend $1.2 billion in
the next three years to roll back the state's income tax rate from
5.95 to 5 percent. It is not a proposal that will distinguish his
tenure in the corner office.
</P>
<P>
   For almost a decade, the Department of Social Services has been
the last priority of the Weld-Cellucci administration. As caretaker
governor for 17 months, Cellucci continued his predecessor's
policies of benign neglect. He is faced with an opportunity to do
the right thing with a budget surplus this year that the
Massachusetts Taxpayers Association estimates will fall anywhere
between $300 million and $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Spend it on our children.
</P>
<P>
   At the courthouse this week, jurors examined the autopsy
photographs of a little boy's torso, his thigh, his shoulder, his
groin. They took notes on the shape of his bruises, on the
discoloration of his skin. As if, in reassembling the pieces of the
puzzle that was once a child, they could make Eric Dawood whole
again.

SPECIAL RECIPE IS A SECRET BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR CAN OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The vocabulary of fine dining experiences is varied and varying.
As trend follows trend and experts enthuse over different cuisines,
those of us observing from our kitchens pick up such words as
``fennel'' and ``focaccia.'' Almost without trying, we've learned
to rattle off terms like ``Cajun'' and ``fusion'' and
``reduction,'' and sometimes even back them up with their edible
incarnations. It's hard to remember when ``sun-dried tomato,''
``cilantro,'' and ``celeriac'' weren't part of the home cook's
everyday parlance.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely, however, do the words ``canned goods'' find their way
into the discourse. Compared with the elegance and occasional
mystery of such relative newcomers to the grocery store as mesclun
and portobellos, the contents of the tin or aluminum can might seem
passe, a relic of the colorless cooking of the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone uses canned goods, of course _ they just don't brag
about it. Usually they don't think beyond adding a can of chicken
broth for soup or building a pasta sauce with 28 ounces of peeled
tomatoes. But there are more imaginative ways to employ the humble
bean and sardine and their other canned relations. Many canned
goods have evolved to fit modern dietary and nutritional concerns,
coming in low-sodium and low-fat versions, while some _ such as
beans _ are virtually the equivalent of foods cooked from scratch.
Their convenience, versatility, and low cost are undeniable assets.
For a fraction of the cost of a pound of fresh fish, for example, a
can of tuna can be dressed up into a savory, satisfying sauce for
pasta. With the savvy addition of chili sauce or curry paste, red
kidney beans combine with bulgur for a quick vegetarian dish. Here,
then, a few recipes that no one _ not even someone who can
pronounce ``frisee'' _ would guess rely on a can opener.

PASTA WITH TUNA-MINT SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Mary Taylor Simeti's recipe for pasta with
swordfish, in ``Pomp and Sustenance'' (Knopf, 1989).
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 large, very ripe tomatoes, peeled and chopped (or 1 cup
canned)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped parsley mixed with 1 tablespoon dried mint
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 can (6 ounces) tuna
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup water (liquid drained from tuna can be used)
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound pasta
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces mozzarella, diced
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Saute the whole garlic cloves in the olive oil until they are
pale golden. Add the tomatoes, all but a few tablespoons of the
parsley-mint mixture, and salt and pepper, and simmer for 5
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the garlic, then add the tuna and the water. Simmer for
about 15 to 20 minutes over a low flame.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, cook the pasta in abundant salted water, drain
it well, and put it in a large serving dish. Add the tuna sauce and
the mozzarella, mixing well so that the mozzarella melts in the
heat of the pasta. Garnish with parsley-mint mixture and serve
immediately.

FISH WITH ARTICHOKES
</P>
<P>
   A sublimely tangy, easy-to-prepare dish. Adapted from Marcella
Hazan's ``More Classic Italian Cooking'' (Knopf, 1978).
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 pounds firm white fish (such as cod, scrod, or pollock)
</P>
<P>
   1 can (1 pound) artichokes in brine, drained and halved
(quartered if large)
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried or 1 to 2 teaspoons fresh rosemary
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In a baking dish large enough to hold the fish and artichokes,
mix together the lemon juice, oil, rosemary, salt, and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the fish into 3 or 4 chunks and place in the baking dish,
turning to coat well with the sauce. Push the fish to one side
while you stir the artichoke hearts into the sauce to coat them
well, then spread out the fish on the bottom of the dish and
arrange the artichokes over and around it. Bake, uncovered, till
the fish is done, about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 3 to 4.

<P>
   In a deep lidded skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
Add the onion and green pepper, if using, and saute until the
vegetables are soft. (If you like, turn up the heat so the
vegetables get browned on the edges.) Stir in the bulgur and mix
well to coat with the oil and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Add the water or tomato juice, then stir in the barbecue sauce
or curry paste. Cover the pan, turn down the heat, and simmer until
the bulgur is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in the beans, then
taste and adjust the seasoning. Add a bit more liquid if the
mixture seems too dry.
</P>
<P>
   Cover and simmer till the beans are hot. Garnish with parsley or
cilantro, if desired.

   Melt the butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Add the
onions, cover, and cook for 20 minutes. Then add the beets,
vinegar, sugar, coriander, and salt. Stir well and simmer,
uncovered, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the beet mixture, in batches, to a food processor and
process until very well mixed with no chunks of beet remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Return the puree to a saucepan and stir well over low heat until
heated through. (Or transfer to an ovenproof serving dish, cover
with aluminum foil, and heat in a preheated 350-degree oven until
steaming hot, for 25 minutes.)

SMOKED FISH PATE
</P>
<P>
   If you don't use the toasted almond garnish, try serving this
with sesame seed crackers.
</P>
<P>
   1 can (3 1/2 ounces) kippered snacks, drained, or 1 can (4 1/4
ounces) sardines, drained
</P>
<P>
   4 to 5 ounces cream cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon cream or milk
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 teaspoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 tablespoons minced onion or scallion
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste

<P>
   Liquid smoke to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon toasted almonds (optional), for garnish

</P>
<P>
   With a fork, mash the kippers or sardines in a bowl until fairly
smooth. Add the cream cheese and mash together with the fish until
smooth, thinning as necessary with the cream or milk and the lemon
juice to get a spreadable consistency. Add the minced onion, a
small pinch of salt, and, if necessary, 1 or 2 drops of liquid
smoke. (Kippers are already smoked, so if you use them you may not
need to add any liquid smoke.) Mix together thoroughly and taste
for seasoning. (Add more liquid smoke very carefully; it is a very
powerful flavoring agent.) When the mixture is seasoned as you
like, mound in a small bowl. Sprinkle with optional toasted almonds
and serve.

IN THE LAND OF THE EURO, THE FRENCH FUME

<P>
   BRUSSELS _ What's in a name? Plenty when it comes to Europe's
new single currency.
</P>
<P>
   The euro, which on Jan. 1 became the currency for 11 European
Union countries, was hailed by officials here, the EU capital, as
the crowning achievement of a campaign for European integration.
</P>
<P>
   But the euro has also served to highlight the cultural and
linguistic differences across the continent that make problematic
the creation of a political and economic bloc to rival the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The French are angriest over the designation of the new economic
union as ``Euroland.'' They consider this use of an English word as
an insult, particularly because Britain is one of three countries
that chose not to participate in the euro launch. Greece wanted to
join but could not reduce its debt and inflation levels enough to
qualify, while the British, Swedes and Danes decided it was a
foolhardy surrender of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   French purists are incensed by what they consider yet another
Anglicization, a process aided and abetted in this instance by the
European Union. If French is the language of diplomacy, English has
become the language of finance. This fact is especially galling to
the Gauls.
</P>
<P>
   Former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing was among those
who vociferously denounced the term ``Euroland,'' first coined by
American bankers and adopted by European Union officials because
they think it sounds hip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a horrible expression, an Anglo-Saxon expression of
denigration,'' opined the former president, in French.
</P>
<P>
   Herve Lavenir de Buffon, president of the International
Committee for French as a European Language, was even more
strident, suggesting that adopting Euroland was an act of ``cheap
Americanization and treason against Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The august Academie Francaise formally ruled last week in Paris
that ``Euroland'' is a non-non. ``The Academy advises against the
use of `Euroland' because it is not the name of a sovereign state
or even a confederation, but simply the area of application of a
treaty,'' concluded the academy, which is the official guardian of
Gallic culture, in a communique. ``One never speaks of dollar-land
or sterling-land but of the dollar zone and the sterling zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy recommended calling the bloc the ``euro zone,''
pointing out that this is the term used by the Bank of France.
</P>
<P>
   But by joining the single currency, the Bank of France and the
10 other central banks in Euroland have become largely irrelevant.
Monetary policy for the bloc is set by the new European Central
Bank in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Other French institutions, including leading newspapers such as
Liberation, have taken to adding an ``e'' to the end of Euroland to
make it look more like the spellings of Ireland and Finland, which
are Irlande and Finlande in French. But as some Eurocrats here
point out, ``lande'' in French means open, uncultivated land.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking privately over dinner at an impeccable French
restaurant called La Maison du Cygne here on the Grand Place, one
European Union official said he was reluctant to arm those opposed
to the single currency with such a propaganda coup as the word
Eurolande.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be calling this the euro desert,'' he said.

NINETIES NOMENCLATURE, LOVE SCIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are a country drawn irresistibly toward the art of
trend-making, toward braiding together a few of the very many
strands, toward identifying new cultural thrusts and counterthrusts
that signify. Are we afraid our world, so fragmented, so
fast-paced, so stranger-than-fiction, will spin out of control? Are
we unable to deal with a deluge of the unique, the one-of-a-kind,
the purely original? It's lots of fun, of course, gathering up bits
of evidence of the national mood from TV and the movies and the
news, to piece together a corner of the ever-growing puzzle. But
trendifying is also satisfying on a much deeper level, as it feeds
a great hunger for a semblance of order amid all the electronically
enhanced chaos.
</P>
<P>
   And so the race for the definitive name for the Nineties is on,
as this curious 10-year story draws to a close. In the coming
months, expect reams of very smart trendifying, a bunch of clever
phrases, and a massive effort to be objective about a decade that
is still very much upon us. The February Vanity Fair begins the
festivities, with an impressive run at the Nineties in a long
article by David Kamp called ``The Tabloid Decade.'' Kamp says
that, just as previous decades had their crystallizing events (for
the '50s it was the House Un-American Activities hearings, for the
'60s it was J.F.K.'s assassination, for the '70s it was Nixon's
resignation, for the '80s it was the economic boom), the '90s will
find its moment in the O.J. Simpson trial, ``a prolonged Hollywood
Babylon spectacle that confirmed the prevailing national interest
in sex, death, celebrity, and televised car chases.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamp's Tabloid Decade has its official start in the 1991
porn-theater arrest of Pee-wee Herman, which got much more
attention than it ever deserved. Behind the fraudulent parental
concern about the fall of a children's icon, there was
``countrywide mirth at his humiliation,'' Kamp writes, a mirth that
next found its target in the Clarence Thomas hearings, which
presaged the Starr report ``in their public airing of humiliating
details.'' And then parade began, with Amy Fisher and Joey
Buttafuoco, Lorena and John Wayne Bobbitt, Tonya Harding and Jeff
Gillooly, Woody and Mia, the Menendez brothers, Heidi Fleiss,
Gennifer Flowers, Michael Jackson's child accuser . . . America
began its open love of ``going where the stink is,'' as Matt Drudge
puts it, a love that culminated seven years after Pee-wee Herman
with Ken Starr's document dump.
</P>
<P>
   Kamp pulls a lot of information together nicely, looking at the
minitrends within the miditrend (maxitrend should probably be saved
up for millennial guesswork), and talking to some well-chosen
observers, including director John Waters, whose movies ride on a
sort of tabloid joyousness. Waters points out that real tabloids
like the National Enquirer (``we hate you because you're famous''),
the Star (``we hate you because you're on TV''), and the Globe
(``we hate you because you're famous and have sex'') are losing out
in the Tabloid Decade. ``My sense is that they hate the Monica
story, because they've been robbed of it. They feel gyped. It
should be theirs, and it's everyone's.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamp is also responsible for the least interesting piece in VF,
the cover story on the forthcoming ``Star Wars'' sequel, which
bears the cumbersome title ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace.'' Just as Kamp is naming the decade before it's over, he is
turning the next chapter in George Lucas' sci-fi series into a
classic before it's even finished. The reason for the story is that
Lucas has let VF into his shroud of secrecy, for a few promotional
interviews, a bland photo spread by Annie Leibovitz, and an
exclusive preview of the text that will appear at the beginning of
the film, which begins ``A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away
. . . '' But there's not much here, beyond the hype.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I was struck by the coverlines on February's Life magazine,
which read ``The Science of Love: What researchers now know about
how we fall in love and why we stay in love.'' Now here I thought
love was marvelous and mysterious, but it turns out we are driven
to mate, marry, and remain monogamous thanks to ``a complex mix of
naturally occurring chemicals and hormones _ cupid's elixers, if
you will.'' (Do we have any choice?) The whole attraction thing
comes down to a pretty little cocktail made up of dopamine and
norepinephrine and phenylethylamine, and this potion brings on ``a
slight buzz'' like ``a very low dose of amphetamines,'' as well as
``almost irrational feelings.'' That means that within the next 10
years, according to one professor, we'll be able to treat marital
unbliss easily and painlessly, with ``brain chemical nasal sprays
to enhance love between a couple.'' Hey, wasn't that popular back
in the '70s?

HE WAS NEVER GONE, BUT THE BARD IS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's everywhere. Up there on the silver screen, double-clutching
with Gwyneth Paltrow. He's got a play running over at the
Huntington Theatre, and another one at what a friend of mine
uncharitably calls the American Repertory Museum of Avant-Garde
Theater. I heard him on a radio show the other day. Not The Man
himself, but His representative here on earth, Yale professor
Harold Bloom.
</P>
<P>
   BBC listeners recently voted him the man of the millennium,
edging out tough competitors like Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin.
According to the search engine Yahoo!, he's got 15,323 web pages to
his credit. (Compare with 1,336 for ``Mamet, David.'') At this very
moment, Mongolia's minister of culture is commissioning a CD-ROM of
one of his plays.
</P>
<P>
   We speak, of course, of William Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   All you clever English majors who fantasize about writing the
next ``There's Something About Mary'' or ``South Park'' episode _
maybe it's time to ``banish hence these abject lowly dreams''
(``The Taming of the Shrew'') and aim a little higher. Writing for
the gronk culture is fine, if you want a nice car or to make a
little headway in the singles scene.
</P>
<P>
   But if you'd like to have a reputation that endures for four
centuries, you might adopt a style ``by spirits taught to write /
above a mortal pitch'' (Sonnet 86). In his book, ``Shakespeare: The
Invention of the Human,'' dewlapped acolyte Bloom makes a
persuasive argument for his subject's near-divinity. Shakespeare is
``a mortal god,'' quoth Bloom. ``Some authors are indeed dead, but
not William Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   So, how fares Shakespeare in ``the flinty ribs of our
contemptuous city'' (``King John'')? Pretty well. I launched my
personal Shakespeare safari last week at the ART's production of
``The Merchant of Venice,'' which I did not expect to enjoy. So I
was disappointed, in a good way. The production was fine, edgy, and
excusably incoherent. Bloom himself waxes incoherent on
``Merchant'' in his book, but he's correct when he writes: ``The
Holocaust made and makes `The Merchant of Venice' unplayable, at
least in what appear to be its own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Merchant'' was written as a comedy, but of course the travails
and ``trial'' of Shylock, powerfully rendered by Will LeBow in this
version, don't evoke any humor these days. The play ends with a
comic act disentangling two pairs of entangled lovers, but after
Shylock has been offered a choice between death and a forced
conversion to Christianity, the audience really doesn't feel like
laughing any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' at the Huntington reaches for less
and comes up with more. Much ink has been shed praising the
MacArthur-certified genius director Mary Zimmerman; her real genius
in this production of ``Dream'' is staying out of the way. Not a
bad idea, in a play Bloom deems ``flawless.'' The set is perfect,
and this ``Dream'' has the best-directed ending of any Shakespeare
play I've seen, which may say more about my theatergoing habits
than about Ms. Z's directorial acumen.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, but not leastly, I took in Joseph Fiennes's over-the-top
performance in the movie ``Shakespeare in Love.'' It's a great role
in a great movie that will bring the Bard home to a larger audience
than a barrel full of Yale profs. Bloom has dumped all over
``Love,'' and trashes most recent popularizations of Shakespeare,
whether it be Kenneth Branagh's ``Hamlet,'' ``Henry IV,'' or ``Much
Ado About Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But for once the self-styled Bardolator is wrong. ``The purest
spring is not so free from mud,'' Shakespeare reminds us in ``Henry
VI,'' Part 2. Some impurities have curative properties, as
Bardophiles like Branagh and the writers of ``Love,'' Marc Norman
and Tom Stoppard, demonstrate while running Shakespeare through
their well-tempered typewriters.
</P>
<P>
   Will I wax so lyrical when the planned film version of ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream'' comes out, starring Kevin Kline as Bottom
(maybe), Michelle Pfeiffer as Titania (groan), and Calista
Flockhart (red alert!) as Helena? ``Opinion's but a fool,'' He
writes in Pericles. Maybe Flockhart &AMP; Co. will prove to be such
stuff as dreams are made on.

MICHAEL JORDAN LEAVES BIG SHOES TO FILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Michael Jordan's re-retirement has forced us to
examine our attitude toward one of America's most prevalent
contemporary pastimes _ slapping his best highlights into a single
reel, backed by music you would throw your radio out the window to
avoid hearing ever again.
</P>
<P>
   The miserable pop tunes melded onto his incandescent moments
have brought all right-thinking people to their knees since the
news of his departure broke. He left us with memories for a
lifetime, and we responded with a jukebox full of slop that
wouldn't make the cut on Jock Jams XVIII.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. He leaves the NBA to its own inadequate devices, and
he leaves our ears the same way.
</P>
<P>
   He did the right thing for him, of course. A glorified
half-season, his own agent routed by the forces of David Stern, his
favorite coach (Phil Jackson) gone and his least favorite executive
(Jerry Krause) still sitting in place, and above all, the prospect
of winning a cheapened championship to go with the six full-sized
ones he already has ... frankly, what's in it for him to stay?
</P>
<P>
   Ahh, but what of the rest of us? Much has been made that he does
not leave behind a logical inheritor to his crown the way Magic
Johnson and Larry Bird left theirs to him, or Julius Erving to
them. What has not been discussed is what the rest of us do about
his absence.
</P>
<P>
   There is much to be done, of course. First, we will have to
feign interest in the NBA while we endure the wholesale remaking of
the 29 rosters (well, the 28 that aren't the Bulls; they are, as we
all know, headed for Warriorville at top speed).
</P>
<P>
   We will have to pretend that 61 percent of a season is the same
as a full season, that we won't know who is on what team until the
playoffs start, and that we will still be interested when the
Finals end at the same time as baseball's All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   That, though, is the easy part. Whatever it is that Jordan has
done all these years, it has nothing to do with us, and we all
understand that.
</P>
<P>
   Here, though, is where the sledding gets difficult.
</P>
<P>
   We have to find new heroes upon whom to spread our post-Jordan
worship, and there really is nobody worthy of it.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal hasn't been to a Finals since 1995, and more
viscerally, his teams' records in the last series they have played
is an absurd 1-19. Thus, we remember him mostly as a guy who
couldn't win the big one, even when the big one has just been an
opening-round series.
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon is the best of a tiny group of non-Jordanians
who have rings in this decade, but he will turn 36 before the
season begins. The other big names the league sold with such
alacrity in this decade are also on the back nine, career-wise _
Charles Barkley (35), Joe Dumars (34), Patrick Ewing (36), Karl
Malone (35), Reggie Miller (33), Gary Payton (30), Scottie Pippen
(33), Glen Rice (31), Mitch Richmond (33), David Robinson (33),
Dennis Rodman (37) and John Stockton (36).
</P>
<P>
   Their replacements _ well, there won't be any, because the
league's big thinkers have determined that they set their own
financial trap by promoting the players above the teams, and while
this benefited Jordan, it also elevated lots of pretenders and even
non-contenders. Shoe companies have scaled seriously back on their
endorsers, and the owners, having won the lockout, are sure to want
to win the peace as well.
</P>
<P>
   We have to decide if it's worth the bother to punish the teams
by not attending the games or watching them on television. Oh, a
few of us operate on the lofty principle of a dollar lost for a
dollar wasted, but even baseball in its darkest times lost only
about 10 percent of its paying customers. Jordan's loss will mean
50 fewer sellouts this year (out of 725 games), and 82 thereafter
(out of 1,189), but crowds have always responded more to their own
teams' successes than another team's marquee. After all, Jordan at
his best could only be in one building at a time.
</P>
<P>
   We have to decide if we can see redemption in the Golden State
Warriors the day after Latrell Sprewell is traded.
</P>
<P>
   We have to decide if we can live with the spectre of Ahmad
Rashad wandering aimlessly with nobody to talk to.
</P>
<P>
   We have to decide if we will spend that extra $170 on a pair of
Air Potapenkos.
</P>
<P>
   We have to decide, more comprehensively, who will sell us our
next phone card, our next cereal box, our next pair of underwear,
our next ... well, our next everything. We have to decide who will
lead us into the next century when politics, commerce, wrestling,
Mark McGwire, animated television shows, the Internet and Sandra
Bullock tear-jerkers fail us.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, we have no answers.

A Y2K DEADLINE NEARS, UTILITIES LACK GUARANTEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a breakfast meeting in a Boston financial district office
tower recently, Boston Edison manager Jim Ashkar displayed a slide
spelling out the question on the minds of 100 business executives
who had turned out to hear him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the lights stay on 1/1/2000?'' the slide read.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will they?'' called somebody from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the $64,000 question!'' replied Ashkar, who
coordinates Boston Edison's efforts to ensure that the local power
grid will operate through the millennial date change _ and the
resulting computer software problem popularly known as the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   The work by Boston Edison and other utilities to resolve the
issue is vital. As the North American Electric Reliability Council
warned last September: ``The electric industry's year 2000
preparedness is crucial to the operation of virtually every aspect
of the economies of the United States and Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   But like other utilities, Edison and its parent, BEC Energy,
will not promise that their distribution network will function 356
days from now. Rather, Edison will say that it is ``very optimistic
that there will be only minimal problems'' come Jan. 1, 2000. In a
$32 million race to prepare for the new century, 70 Edison
employees are reviewing codes for 300 computer systems. Their work
is scheduled to be completed by mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   That date, however, is later than the utility industry's
self-imposed June 30 deadline. Northeast Utilities, which serves
Western Massachusetts and most of Connecticut and New Hampshire,
says it also expects to miss the deadline, by a month.
</P>
<P>
   The US Department of Energy is keeping an eye on the deadline as
it tracks the industry's ability to keep the computerized switching
equipment at the heart of the nation's electric grid on line.
Edison and Northeast say their lagging schedules should not be
cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they also say prudent customers should expect at least minor
problems or blackouts on New Year's Day 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who assumes it will be perfection has a
misperception,'' Ashkar said at his presentation, hosted Tuesday by
the World Affairs Council.
</P>
<P>
   Ashkar said Edison and other utilities cannot offer more
specific guidance, in part because of concerns over legal
liability. But given the stakes, that stance vexes public
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members need to come away with some assurances and not
just fluffy statements,'' said Leon Jacobs, who heads the Y2K task
force of the National Association of Regulatory Utility
Commissioners in Washington. Dennis DiMarzio, chief operating
officer for the city of Boston, plans to meet soon with BEC Energy
and other providers of basic services to hear their specific Y2K
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for more assurance,'' DiMarzio said.
</P>
<P>
   It is an awkward position for monopoly power distributors,
unaccustomed to strict deadlines. Never mind the millennium, says
David Jacobs of Eastern Utility Associates in Boston, ``We can
never guarantee that the lights are even going to stay on
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Y2K bug'' refers to the difficulties expected to affect
computers programmed to use only the last two digits of the year to
keep track of dates. Whereas ``99'' indicates the current year,
some computers might interpret next year's ``00'' as 1900, and
malfunction or shut down.
</P>
<P>
   As the power industry's reliability council notes, much of the
country's basic infrastructure will be vulnerable unless systems
are reprogrammed. For New England's bulk-power distribution system,
those improvements are being monitored by New England's so-called
Indepedent System Operator, based in Holyoke. James Sinclair, the
group's spokesman, said the organization is comfortable with the
progress of its member utilities.
</P>
<P>
   So will the lights stay on?
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to ask the membership,'' Sinclair said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the wrong question,'' said Howard Gruenspecht, a staff
member of the US Energy Department who helps oversee the industry's
Y2K response. More immediately, he says, regulators must make sure
utilities that miss the June 30 target can explain why. Some spot
checks of lagging utilities are likely later this year, Gruenspecht
indicated.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving reports from the country's largest electric
utilities last September, the Energy Department said the industry
``needs to accelerate its efforts.'' An updated survey was released
Jan. 11, a report Gruenspecht said showed utilities are making
``reasonable'' progress.
</P>
<P>
   Handicapping the outlook for specific utility companies is
difficult. Trade groups will not discuss the progress of individual
members; except for Northeast Utilities, most local power
distributors declined to release filings describing their
performance. Boston Edison spokesman Michael Monahan said that
``There's so much minute detail it could be confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the reports were available from the state's Department of
Telecommunications and Energy, which had also requested them from
the utilities.
</P>
<P>
   These filings suggest a mixed picture of the progress being made
by New England's three largest utilities compared to other electric
distributors in the Northeast and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, New England's big three _ Northeast Utilities,
Boston Edison, and New England Electric System _ seem to be ahead.
For example, by June 1, 1998, Boston Edison had finished counting
which systems it needed to check for Y2K problems, and had assessed
problems to see how they might be fixed, several months ahead of
most other utilities in the region.
</P>
<P>
   But the three lag in other categories. New England Electric and
Northeast do not plan to finish assessing their systems until Jan.
31 and March 31, 1999, respectively, well behind the average
completion date of Nov. 19, 1998 for the region.
</P>
<P>
   Also, as of Nov. 25, 1998, none of the three had finished
planning for special Y2K conditions like temporarily taking
malfunctioning power plants off line or recovering from blackouts.
Other utilities had already developed such plans and a few had
tested them.
</P>
<P>
   New England's biggest utilities do expect to have contingency
plans in place by the summer. Out of 40 systems it calls
``mission-critical,'' Boston Edison says only one system will not
be ready by the June 30 deadline. The company blames the delay on a
Montreal software maker that is providing upgrades to the system,
used to track the performance of Edison's energy distribution
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think it's that significant,'' Edison's Ashkar said.
</P>
<P>
   But software consultants working on Y2K remediation say they
worry about missed deadlines because final tests can take longer
than expected. ``You need as much time to test as possible,'' said
Tony Wray, a sales manager in New England for Nexus Unlimited Inc.,
a systems integrator in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Should remediation efforts fail, other power executives are
developing backup measures to reduce the strain on the region's
electric grid.
</P>
<P>
   One plan would put extra power plants into standby mode by Dec.
31. Another more costly option would be to suspend the exchange of
power between neighboring regions of the country, keeping each
region's grid independent and, theoretically, less vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Elacqua, a New York Power Pool engineer in Albany, N.Y.,
who oversees regional Y2K readiness, said he expects such efforts
will keep the bulk-power distribution system functioning. Besides,
he said, demand for electricity during a January holiday typically
runs at just 40 percent of New England's summertime peak of around
20,500 megawatts. That means plenty of power plants should be
available to provide backup generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic, but I'm also realistic,'' Elacqua said. ``I'm
not going to say that there won't be any local blackouts. But there
won't be any bulk-power system blackouts. We won't lose the whole
Eastern Seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be isolated pockets throughout the US,'' Elacqua
added. ``But hopefully it's nothing to worry about. We're
experienced at putting things back together once something
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, most of the lights will stay on?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said Janet Gail Besser, chairwoman of the Massachusetts
Department of Telecommunications and Energy. The agency began
surveying the utility companies it oversees last spring, and Besser
says she is satisfied with their preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Typical is one filing from Northeast Utilities: ``NU has found
nothing that cannot be repaired or replaced and be made Year 2000
ready in time,'' it states. Northeast is also the region's largest
nuclear utility, owning most of the Millstone facility in
Waterford, Conn., and the Seabrook, N.H., reactor.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Northeast has spent about $11 million of the $30 million
it expects to pay to review codes and fix weaknesses. Spokeswoman
Debra Durbin said the company is not concerned that its scheduled
completion date lags the rest of the industry because the company's
July 31 goal was set several years ago. She said the date still
reflects ``prudent planning.''
</P>
<P>
   Durbin also mentioned a Northeast site on the World Wide Web
discussing questions the utility often gets, such as: Should
households buy portable electric generators? The company responds
that ``The leader of our Millennium Program team has no plans to
buy a generator for his home, because he does not expect to need
one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is, however, an individual choice,'' the company adds.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ross Paasche had bought books and sold stocks over the Internet.
But as a professional seafood buyer, he doubted many others in his
own industry were of a mind to go on line.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with holidays coming up and demand certain to build for
calamari, a seasonal tradition in many homes, he took a chance.
Before going home one evening last fall he posted a request for the
squid delicacy on an Internet site, GoFish.
</P>
<P>
   The number of calls he got the next day ``threw me for a loop,''
said Paasche, who works for Agar Supply Co. in Boston, a wholesale
distributor of meat, poultry and seafood. And one was a winner,
from a supplier known for quality who offered ``such a bargain,
such high quality, that I saved enough money to go up a level in
quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Shedding its low-tech reputation, New England's fisheries
industry is putting electronic commerce and information technology
to work to speed a globalization demanded by shortages in haddock,
cod, and other popular species.
</P>
<P>
   Deals once cut in a smoke-filled Boston Fish Pier auction room
are being replaced by a system that can deliver market quotes via
the Internet to laptop and desktop computers from Boston to Seattle
and Bangkok and Buenos Aires, many of those quotes open for all to
see, and at the blink-of-an-eye speeds these perishable products
require.
</P>
<P>
   When combined with better refrigeration and low-cost bulk air
transport, e-commerce is being seen as the next step in assuring
consumers of uniform quality, at prices that reflect actual market
conditions and reduce middleman charges.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, information technology is being seen as a
framework for specialty trading, by which consumers who will settle
for nothing else can track down hard-to-find products _ Alaska king
crab, for example, rarely sold in the East _ that they can buy on
line directly from the fisherman who caught it.
</P>
<P>
   The key word in all this is ``information,'' says Neal Workman,
43, who heads SeaFax Inc., the Portland, Maine, company that
introduced GoFish to the World Wide Web last August.
</P>
<P>
   ``The invisible hand of business is imperfect information,''
Workman said, paraphrasing Adam Smith. And the fish industry, in
which most of the work done is at sea or in distant ports, suffers
imperfect information more than most others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet starts to make things a little tighter _ it
starts to take some of the shell game out of the business,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big story here,'' says Ken Coons, director of the
Boston-based New England Fisheries Development Association, ``is
the global flow of fish'' that has resulted from shortages of
traditional fish species in North America and Europe. Once unknown
species such as orange roughy, from the South Pacific, are now
common on American tables, and high-speed technology has arrived
just in time to deal with this trading revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Coons describes electronic trading of fish as ``an on-line
version of the farmer's market,'' and sees even greater use when _
as biologists hope _ limits imposed on fishermen to rebuild
depleted stocks have done their job and catches are so big that
``it will take a lot of mechanisms to get it all to market.''
</P>
<P>
   Workman learned the value of information as a commodity when he
set out, in 1987, as a bill collector who chased down delinquent
restaurant owners on behalf of Maine lobstermen.
</P>
<P>
   He soon found others also wanted to know who was not paying on
time, and began publishing semimonthly reports detailing what he
knew. Later, he began sending his reports by fax, a move that was
welcomed in a world where the value of time is measured in spoiled
inventories _ and which led to the name SeaFax.
</P>
<P>
   Workman moved into preparing full-scale credit reports for
clients on a case-by-case basis _ and then began compiling this
information into printed directories and, later, CD-ROM disks, also
sold by annual subscription. By last year, closely held SeaFax had
revenues of more than $5 million annually, Workman said, and the
Internet was his next frontier
</P>
<P>
   Others had beat SeaFax onto the Net. One, Fish Info Service
(www.sea-world.com), based in Tokyo, distributes price and market
data from around the world. The National Marine Fisheries Service
statistical service (www.st.nmfs.gov), does the same for US ports.
Another site is sponsored by the National Fisheries Institute
(www.seafoodlink.com). And the Massachusetts Department of Food and
Agriculture last month launched a site to serve state seafood
exporters (www.massfish.org).
</P>
<P>
   But GoFish (www.seafax.com/gofish) offered the first global
matchmaker service in which vetting of buyers by SeaFax's
credit-rating staff offered sellers some confidence they'd be paid.
</P>
<P>
   GoFish's other advantage, both Workman and his subscribers say,
is its ability to introduce buyers and sellers who might otherwise
have never met. ``All of a sudden you get six or seven different
offerings, and you can select from among them,'' said James R.
Faro, president of Sea Star Seafood Corp. of Holliston, which
processes and distributes seafood under its own Beacon Light brand
and various private labels in 38 states.
</P>
<P>
   John Fiorillo, editor of Seafood Business, a monthly trade
magazine, said it's too early to tell the ultimate impact of
on-line buying and selling, but pointed out that only a decade ago
the industry's open-outcry auction system was mostly replaced by
the fax machine. ``Nobody was sure what that (technology) would do,
and now it is the way they do business all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The 350 responses Workman got when he offered free access to
GoFish for 90 days convinced him that an on-line service could
succeed. Since that trial ended Nov. 1, he said, 95 dealers have
signed up for subscriptions that cost between $2,000 and $6,000 a
year, depending on use. Workman said GoFish had $150,000 in
revenues last year, and expects to reach $500,000 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   GoFish so far doesn't give users an option to quote prices.
``They see what's there and then they get off line and haggle over
the price on the phone,'' Workman said.
</P>
<P>
   But a transactional site, where traders could do one-on-one
deals without picking up a telephone, is the second phase of his
business plan. A third phase would be an on-line auction, ``at a
certain time of day, that GoFish would conduct.'' Both would be
promoted as a package that would include SeaFax credit reports.
Sellers would pay GoFish a 1 percent commission, justified by the
credit information they get and time saved by selling on line,
Workman said. GoFish would keep half and rebate the rest to buyers
as an inducement to keep coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-five percent of GoFish's traffic now is in frozen
seafood, which distributors thaw and cut into fillets for sale to
restaurants or grocery stores. Both upscale restaurants and big
supermarket chains are holding back, Workman said, although about
25 smaller grocery chains are members. He thinks larger
organizations will be convinced only if they can see prices on
line, something that sellers so far are reluctant to do.
</P>
<P>
   Workman thinks the US fresh fish market, composed of hundreds of
small boats that sell either through small distributors or at
localized auctions, is too volatile to make much use of GoFish.
</P>
<P>
   But John Sackton, a fisheries consultant in Lexington whose
market research company, Seafood Datasearch, developed the
Massachusetts Department of Food and Agriculture's Web site, sees
the fresh-fish marketplace differently.
</P>
<P>
   Sackton says the Internet's wide-open access is a good forum for
directly matching specialty sellers with buyers who want unusual
species or premium quality. ``On the West Coast there are now some
boats branding their catch by the boat's name, and restaurants are
featuring it that way,'' he said. ``The Internet has potential to
open up this kind of specialty niche.''
</P>
<P>
   Sackton says GoFish faces problems in an industry in which
buyer-seller relationships are important. ``Nobody likes to be
lumped in as just a commodity buyer or seller,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Paasche, at Agar Supply, said using GoFish helped him
establish new relationships. One was with the New Jersey supplier
who submitted the winning response in his first search for 5,000
pounds of frozen calimari.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the quality good, Paasche said, but the money he
saved paid for his first-year subscription to GoFish. Since then
Paasche has both bought and sold haddock, shrimp, scallops, and
calamari, via GoFish, expanding his Rolodex along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of GoFish as a dating service,'' Paasche said. ``I
won't turn back now. This thing exposes you to people all across
the country and around the world. Sometimes in this business you
get blinders on and don't see things you should.''

INTERNET STOCKS DEFYING WALL STREET'S GRAVITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just eight days ago, shares in Internet-site developer CMGI Inc.
sold for $57.25 apiece; Tuesday they traded for more than twice
that, $130.75. Yahoo Inc., the search-engine company, has seen its
stock nearly double over the same period, to $402. And
Broadcast.com, an Internet radio and television provider, ended the
session at $223 a share, nearly three times what the stock fetched
at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in these and other Internet stocks during the past two
months has spawned a buying frenzy the likes of which Wall Street
has not seen in a generation. Even though investors stopped to
catch their breath Tuesday, prompting a selloff of some Internet
issues, the mania for stocks of companies connected to cyberspace
shows little sign of abating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's buying them,'' said Ken Pasternak, president of
the brokerage firm Knight Securities in Jersey City, N.J., which
handles stock orders for Internet trading companies. Everybody, he
said, ``down to taxicab drivers and housewives'' and anyone else
who has ``felt the empowerment of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   By traditional standards, hardly any of the Internet companies
deserve to trade at the atmospheric prices they have reached in
recent days. Even some of the best-known Internet companies, like
on-line bookseller Amazon.com, do not expect to turn a profit any
time soon. Yet thanks to the run-up of its stock, the 4-year-old
company has a market value of $26 billion, six times the combined
value of its two main competitors, traditional booksellers Borders
Group Inc. and Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of profits hardly seems to matter to Internet investors,
many of them trading on-line from home computers, far from the
advice of stock brokers. In their world, fundamental yardsticks
like revenue estimates take a back seat to the drive for quick
gains _ and the belief that companies making their mark in the
rapidly growing area of electronic commerce have bright futures,
whatever their bottom lines say now.
</P>
<P>
   So who has the nerve to buy the inflated shares of these
companies?
</P>
<P>
   James Payne for one. A computer science major at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the 20-year-old Payne said
that so far this month he has made $10,000 trading in Internet
stocks and other issues. Each morning, he boots up a personal
computer loaded with software that tracks the Nasdaq stock
exchange, where most Internet issues are traded.
</P>
<P>
   Payne said he has ``absolutely not'' mastered the art of valuing
stocks over the long term and has no intention of doing so. But he
said he has grown adept at anticipating increases in individual
stocks at specific moments. ``This is about seeing a pattern and
stepping in front of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Payne also has made mistakes. The worst, he said, came last
month when he went to the gym while still holding shares of
Amazon.com. By the time he returned, he had lost $1,000. Now he
tries to sell all his shares at the end of each two-hour trading
session before heading to his part-time job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know when this (Internet) bubble is going to burst,
and I don't want to be there when it does,'' Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   A friend, MIT senior Jeremy Roy, who also dabbles as a so-called
day trader, said he lost $500 last week when he stepped away from
his screen to use the restroom, but he has made it back and still
hopes to make big profits in technology trades.

   Investors like Payne and Roy have been stoking Internet stocks
since early December, analysts say, helping push the
technology-heavy Nasdaq market index to record levels this month.
According to BankBoston Corp., the combined total value of all
Internet stocks rose to about $275 billion on Monday _ or twice of
the size of Hong Kong's stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq has gained 63 percent since a recent low last Oct. 8
of 1419.12. The index, after breaking another record Monday, lost
63.84 points Tuesday, closing at 2320.75, amid concerns that the
sector had become overheated. But even with Tuesday's declines,
many Internet stocks remain well above their levels of a few months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Investment professionals appear hard pressed to make sense of it
all. Many believe the unbridled enthusiasm for Internet stocks may
screech to a halt and are avoiding them.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Riley, BankBoston Corp.'s chief investment officer, said he
is not buying any Internet stocks for the bank's $27 billion
portfolio. Riley said the stocks ``may be the greatest illusion
we've seen since David Copperfield made a 737 disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than buy these stocks, Riley said, the bank holds the
shares of profitable companies that make an identifiable product
related to the World Wide Web, such as Cisco Systems, Lucent
Technologies Inc. and Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But Rob Adler, president of CCBN.com in Boston, an on-line
financial data provider, thinks the Internet the boom is far from
over. He offers a simple explanation for why it will continue:
supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The supply (of Internet stocks) is grossly limited compared to
their place in the world,'' Adler said. ``The fact is that
everybody thinks that the Internet is going to open up a lot of new
electronic channels of commerce, and they want to have a piece of
that in their portfolios.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say the boom is being driven by the rise of small
investors, who are taking advantage of on-line trading services,
and are not shy about speculating in stocks they think are on the
way up.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we see particularly here in New York . . . is that
there's a huge amount of day trading going on, both by the firms
that specialize in that, as well as Internet-savvy people trading
the Internet stocks on the Internet from home,'' said Robert
Yevich, president of the Tucker Anthony Inc. retail brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   Amateur investment crazes have long been a staple of the
markets. Most recently, biotechnology stocks became notoriously
volatile as small investors tried to match their limited knowledge
of complex scientific developments against the chance of making
large profits.
</P>
<P>
   But never before the Internet run-up have lightning-fast
decisions by amateur investors had such an impact on industry
leaders, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet bubble is as big (a bubble) as I've ever seen,''
said Robert M. Whelan, a partner in the Boston office of Volpe
Brown Whelan &AMP; Co., an investment banking firm specializing in
technology companies.

RETURNS SHINE, BUT DON'T SCRATCH TOO HARD 
</HEADLINE>

 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mutual fund investors who stood steady during Wall Street's
fizzles last year can reward themselves with champagne. A sparkling
fourth-quarter rally in the stock market rescued fund shareholders
from a downturn that threatened to end
</P>
<P>
   the long party for investors.
</P>
<P>
   But to many financial professionals, the gains in 1998 _ tamer
than in recent years _ masked a market more troubled than it
appeared. The danger, some say, is that fund investors will equate
last year's respectable to spectacular returns, depending on where
you invested, with an unstoppable market.
</P>
<P>
   The average US diversified stock fund rose a solid 14.5 percent
in 1998, according to Lipper Inc., the fund tracking firm in
Summit, N.J. While below 1997's 24.6 rise and more in line with
recent historical averages, the bounty nonetheless reflected a
record fourth straight year of double-digit returns on Wall Street.
After slipping 15 percent in the third quarter, when the Dow
swooned, stock funds gained a stunning 22 percent over the last
three months.
</P>
<P>
   The surge made 1998 a cork-popper for funds invested in stocks
of the biggest companies as well as in technology and
telecommunications firms. It was also a banner year for funds that
mirror the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, the market's most common
gauge. In fact, most domestic stock funds had double digit gains
last year, except for funds invested in small to mid-size
companies, natural resources, and real estate.
</P>
<P>
   But disquieting questions abound. One problem is that most of
the gains came from relatively few stocks, mainly the biggest
blue-chips and tech shares; most equity funds had to load up on
those issues to do well. That skewing could prove troubling to the
$5.4 trillion fund industry in a protracted downturn.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P 500 index funds, including the well-known Vanguard 500,
mirrored their benchmark to bring home a stunning 28 percent return
in 1998, better than 9 out of 10 actively managed funds and any
other category of diversified stock fund. Propelled by a mania for
Internet-related shares, tech funds gained 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, funds focused on small companies continued their
miserable streak, losing 0.3 percent despite big fourth-quarter
strides. Those invested in value, or relatively inexpensive, stocks
fell far behind funds in growth stocks, or companies with expanding
sales and profits.
</P>
<P>
   In another measure of the unevenness of 1998's gains, the Dow
Jones industrial average of 30 blue chip stocks, usually not far
behind the S&AMP;P 500, rose only 16.1 percent. And barely half the
issues in the S&AMP;P 500 gained last year, despite the barometer's
overall increase of 26.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with the changes that have swept the nation's fund
industry this decade, the performance differences point to a
volatile cocktail for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   One key issue facing investors this year, according to Tony
Kreisel, manager of Putnam Investment's Growth &AMP; Income II fund, is
that the domestic stock market is now driven less by solid
fundamentals, such as strong earnings growth, and more by scads of
money waiting to be invested at any cost. Most cash idling in
conservative money market funds, including $11 billion yanked out
of stock funds in August as the market sank, is simply looking for
a new stock fund _ evidence that investors believe they will not be
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the lesson of last year is that the market is not what it
seems to be,'' Kreisel said, noting the performance chasms dividing
individual fund categories. The differences, he said, revealed how
fewer issues accounted for the market's gains _ not a portent of a
smooth road ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Many strategists predict a decent but unspectacular year for
stocks but lower corporate earnings as well _ an inconsistency that
begs the question of how shares can rise when company profits
don't. Already many stocks are at record-high valuations, despite
dimmer earnings outlooks. Yet those points may be lost on fund
investors, who by and large will look at 1998's returns and pile
into popular equity funds to seek more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers will always buy past performance,'' said Bruce R.
Specka, president of the New England Funds, pointing out what
investors often forget: that the past does not predict the future.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the intoxication with the Internet _ a phenomenon
known to some as ``tulip.com'', a reference to the 17th century
Dutch mania for speculating in flowers that ended in a crash.
Already Internet fever among money managers and ordinary investors
alike shows some signs of infecting other shares, such as expensive
Microsoft and Intel _ a situation some observers say could presage
a blow-out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has aspects of what some people would call a
bubble,'' said Prof. Richard E. Sylla, an economic historian at New
York University. ``It reminds me a bit of the late 1920s'' _ when
stocks were the wave of the future and faith in new technology was
high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would advise an investor to build up cash, since stocks are
richly valued and subject to a downturn,'' Sylla said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would constitute a major shift for Americans. At the
beginning of 1990, 25 percent of all households owned around $1
trillion in mutual funds, with stock funds accounting for a quarter
of the total. Now the fund-owning population is nearly 40 percent,
and equity funds make up 56 percent of the industry's assets,
according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Although investors grew a shade more conservative in 1998,
putting more net new cash into money market funds than stock funds,
they are back in force this January, traditionally a strong buying
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing now is the belief that the market's
momentum continues,'' said Lipper chairman A. Michael Lipper. He
cautioned later: ``People are extrapolating present trends into the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, each of the past four years has seen investment
professionals ask a trenchant question: Can the returns continue?
</P>
<P>
   Each of those years has ended with good gains. And portfolio
managers who answered the question with a no and sought returns
outside the most popular US stocks often came up empty handed.
</P>
<P>
   For answers, some investors may look increasingly at European
stock funds, which gained 22.6 percent last year on optimism about
monetary integration. Others may point to international funds;
those avoiding emerging markets and most Asian countries, all
disasters last year, rose 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still others may search outside the stock market. Seemingly
boring US Treasury bond funds, deemed a good bet in times of stock
market turmoil, rose 9.7 percent in 1998 _ a hefty gain that may be
telling investors a thing or two about temperance for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investment strategists take the view that the stock market is
the only game in town,'' Lipper said. ``Statistically, of course,
they're right, except when they're wrong. And as last year proved,
when they're wrong, they're wrong big.''

NO AIR TIME HURTS NBC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The truth is in the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Without Michael Jordan, NBC's ratings dropped 22 percent for NBA
games.
</P>
<P>
   Without Michael Jordan, ratings on WGN, the Chicago affiliate
that carried Bulls games, dropped 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Without Michael Jordan, the NBA championship series lost as many
as 8 million viewers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Higher ratings mean higher advertising revenue, and Jordan was
money, television money. Word of his retirement has caused industry
executives to wonder privately just how TV, particularly NBC, plans
to restore the value to a league already deflated by a protracted
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, NBC was downplaying the retirement of His Airness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all been fortunate to have been part of one of the
most magical rides in sports history,'' NBC Sports chairman Dick
Ebersol said in a statement. ``Michael Jordan's retirement is not
completely unexpected, but we've been here before . . . While no
single player can replace the transcendent athlete of this decade,
it will be exciting to see what players and what `super teams' step
into the spotlight for the fans to embrace in the next era.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol is half-right. Back when NBC acquired rights to the NBA
in 1990, critics said the league didn't have a superstar to market
because Magic Johnson and Larry Bird were on the way out.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the numbers from last year. The Bulls were on NBC eight
times during the regular season and pulled an average rating of
6.5, or about 5.7 million households. NBC showed 17 other games
during the season, which were seen by an average of 3.7 million
households. The lowest-rated Bulls game bettered the highest-rated
non-Bulls game.
</P>
<P>
   The real test was the playoffs. When Jordan was playing baseball
in the mid '90s, the NBA Finals between Houston and New York
averaged a 12.4 rating. The next year's championship series,
between Houston and Orlando, averaged a 13.9.
</P>
<P>
   When Jordan played in the Finals, he was able to attract
crossover fans and increase the ratings. In 1992 against Portland,
the rating was 14.2. It was 17.9 against Phoenix in 1993, 16.7 in
1996 against Seattle, and 16.8 in 1997 against Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bulls-Jazz was no different. Game 5 alone pulled a
20.6 rating.
</P>
<P>
   NBC and Turner paid about $2.6 billion last year to televise NBA
games, and though the cable networks felt more pain during the
lockout, NBC will take the ultimate hit with the loss of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Jordan became such an attraction was that NBC gave
his team prime-time exposure. The Sunday games that started at 5:30
p.m. usually featured the Bulls. With no Jordan, and probably no
Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman, the Bulls will be no better than
any other team undergoing a rebuilding year. Or decade.
</P>
<P>
   The question, then, is what team can replace the Bulls as a
prime time player. Never mind what player can replace Jordan; that
person probably hasn't been born yet.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol remain hopeful that something or somebody will emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to reintroduce the new generation of stars in the
NBA,'' he said.

BULLS HAVE DECISIONS TO MAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We got a glimpse of the new Chicago Bulls last June 14, in Game
6 of the NBA Finals. Scottie Pippen was on the bench with a bad
back and Michael Jordan was getting a rare breather. The team
looked horrible.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Bulls know that their rebuilding can begin. Right now,
the team has only four players under contract for this season _ Ron
Harper, Toni Kukoc, Keith Booth, and Randy Brown. They had a
league-high 10 free agents, which are now down to nine. Some of
those _ Pippen, Luc Longley, Steve Kerr, maybe even Dennis Rodman _
may stay on the Bulls' cap while the team decides which way to go.
</P>
<P>
   There are two alternatives. The Bulls can use their cap money to
lure someone such as Antonio McDyess, whom vice president Jerry
Krause loves, then try to re-sign Pippen and Longley and win with
that group. The other is to take a big hit this season and get
ready for the summer, when they'd get a good draft pick and have
oodles of money to spend on a list of free agents that may include
Antoine Walker, Ray Allen, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Glen Rice, and
Stephon Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   Krause said Monday that he would try to rebuild around Pippen
should Jordan retire. The Pippen story is an interesting one. He
has felt underpaid and, at times, underappreciated in his years in
Chicago. He has said he will never wear a Chicago uniform again,
cannot stand Krause, and seemed like a lock to go elsewhere until
the money limits were installed as part of the new Collective
Bargaining Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Would the Bulls make up for Pippen's years of lost wages and
reward him with what he wants, a five-year deal starting at $14
million? Don't count on it. Pippen is 33 and coming off back
surgery, and Chicago may feel that if it can't win without Jordan,
why spend the money on Pippen?
</P>
<P>
   No top-name free agent are likely to sign with the Bulls without
knowing that Pippen is there. McDyess, for instance, is being wooed
heavily by Houston, which also has only four players under
contract. But one of those is Hakeem Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was the top priority, and now the Bulls know about him.
Pippen should be the next stop, except that Chicago would lose its
cap room if it re-signed him right away. But if he did, Krause
could then try to re-sign Longley, Kerr, and others from the title
team and let it roll.
</P>
<P>
   But if Pippen goes elsewhere, or is signed by Chicago and traded
for bodies, then the Bulls go into the tank this season. Krause
will try to load up the roster with serviceable players in the
final years of their contracts or promising rookies. He will then
focus on the 1999 draft and try and rebuild through free agency.
Depending on how the roster is built, the Bulls could have $15
million-$20 million available, enough for two impact players to go
along with what should be a good draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman is a goner without Jordan. What's the point? Rodman, when
he decided to play, was valuable as the third wheel. He'll be no
more than a freak show without Jordan and Pippen and, frankly, it's
hard to see him toeing the line for Tim Floyd. Even the enormously
patient Phil Jackson struggled with Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Longley and Kerr will have suitors and could find new homes.
Teams need centers, and Longley is one, if not a great one. The
Celtics, for instance, could offer their $1.7 million average
exception, but that likely isn't enough. And Longley might not want
to close out his career playing Pitino Ball. (Remember, though,
Longley was part of a trade, along with Pippen, that Pitino mulled
in June 1997.) Phoenix might take a pass at Longley, and it has
money to spend. Detroit is said to be eyeing Kerr for the same role
he had in Chicago, only this time to benefit Grant Hill.
</P>
<P>
   No one is shedding any tears for Krause. The Bulls of the '90s
are a lot like the Celtics of the '80s; there's is no shortage of
teams eager for payback when Chicago stops by. That's the price of
building a consistent winner, and Krause can only hope that he now
also has built a tradition in Chicago, although that may be hard
without Jordan in this day and age.
</P>
<P>
   Krause, of course, is the man who said organizations, not
players, win championships. His organization is about to be put to
the test, and many feel Krause has been salivating for the
opportunity to show that it can be done without No. 23. He drafted
Pippen, Horace Grant, and Kukoc, signed key free agents and made
big deals (Bill Cartwright for Charles Oakley) to get Chicago
rolling. But he always had Jordan. He doesn't have that luxury
anymore.

BENEFITS AND BEYOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Melissa Brisman gave birth to twins 10 months ago, the
Boston lawyer received a basket of toys, bibs, gift certificates,
and a baby book _ courtesy of her employer, Goodwin, Procter &AMP; Hoar
LLP.
</P>
<P>
   Brisman, a tax associate, did not have to go too far for
parenting advice or help, either. The reason? Her employer supplied
it as part of a benefits program for new moms and dads.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't all. Goodwin Procter offers an emergency child-care
center to employees such as Brisman, part-time hours and flexible
scheduling, and a savings program that allows employees to set
aside up to $5,000 in pretax wages for child care.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a Parent Exchange Program the law firm developed with
the help of Workplace Connections Inc., a Waltham, Mass. workplace
benefits firm, offers everything from home visits and counseling
for new parents to help choosing day-care centers or nannies who
best meet their needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These services offer great peace of mind,'' said Brisman, 27,
who splits the responsibility for caring for her fraternal twins
with her husband, a medical resident at a Boston area hospital.
</P>
<P>
   As the demand for skilled employees increases, companies are
doing all they can to hold on to top talent, and that includes
offering more flexibility, more benefits and, yes, more gifts and
perks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In industries that are experiencing the effects of the tight
labor market, they are realizing that after salary, the other thing
that employees look at is the benefits package,'' said Grace
Pantano, president of Workplace Connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Benefits can actually set companies apart in terms of
potential employees' choice of jobs,'' Pantano continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do have lives outside of work, and that is definitely
being recognized by employers more and more.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Kelly, director of human resources at Goodwin Procter,
agreed. ``Our Parents Exchange benefits are geared to keeping
people,'' she said. ``We believe they will help to alleviate some
of the push and pull, the struggle of work and family demands.''
</P>
<P>
   And few understand that struggle better than those who are
trying to balance family or personal needs with the goal of making
partner at a big, competitive law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Nancer Ballard, a senior partner at Goodwin Procter, discovered
as much when she began studying why some young women and men are
abandoning their legal careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The myth of the culture is you work hard and deny yourself,''
Ballard said in an interview with The Boston Globe last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a huge number of women are leaving law, including women
who have gotten past the glass ceiling, and even men are saying
that the prize might not be what they thought it would be,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, severe labor shortages in some industries and
increased competition for top-flight professionals and skilled
employees are forcing employers to pay closer attention.
</P>
<P>
   When Working Mother magazine began compiling information for its
1998 report on the best companies for mothers to work at, it
pinpointed a slew of exceptional benefits designed to help workers
cope with life's many stresses _ and keep them on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   Dayton Hudson, Hewlett-Packard, and Sequent Computer Systems all
offer subsidized public schools at worksites, says Working Mother.
Procter &AMP; Gamble offers insurance coverage for organ transplants,
and Glaxo Wellcome and Motorola give employees cash to help buy
houses or take courses.
</P>
<P>
   At Eli Lilly, profit-sharing added an extra 18 percent to
workers' salaries in 1997. And new parents at IBM Corp. can take
advantage of a three-year unpaid leave program. At Merck, by
contrast, new moms get six months off with a guaranteed return to
their previous job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies compete vigorously to get on the Working Mother 100
list because they want to be known as the most family-friendly
employer in their industry or profession,'' wrote Milton Moskowitz,
who compiled the magazine's list of top firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recruitment needs drive this competition and, of course,
companies want to retain the talented people who already enrich
their ranks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Goodwin Procter, portions of the Parent Exchange Program are
purchased by the law firm and offered to employees free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   A simple list of available child-care centers that meet a
client's specifications costs the law firm $25, for example. The
cost of the entire package? About $1,000, according to Kelly,
Goodwin Procter's human resources director.
</P>
<P>
   Brisman says the program has sent her research information about
twins, parenting, and baby-proofing her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program will help you find day care and, if you want,''
she said, ``a counselor will actually go to the day-care center
with you, or they will give you the list and you can go alone.''

   BOSTON _ Jessica Willard was standing in front of the 30-foot
jet dragster race car called the ``Queen of Diamonds'' at the World
of Wheels show in Boston recently, flashing her smile and
describing the car to anyone who walked by.
</P>
<P>
   But don't for a minute assume that that the 5-foot-3-inch
Willard was serving as window dressing at the show.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Willard is the driver of that needle-nosed,
10,000-horsepower machine, the one who puts on a fire suit and
helmet and gets strapped into the seat to power the race car to
faster than 300 miles per hour in about five seconds. When she hits
the brakes, two parachutes behind the car inflate to help it stop.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the owners of the car did want to find a woman
driver for their team to liven up the marketing, Willard brought
not only her gender, but lots of experience, with her.
</P>
<P>
   Her father made sure of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made me take apart a motor and put it back together before
I drove a real race car,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Willard, a 22-year-old from Leominster, virtually grew up at
racetracks as her mother and father traveled to compete in races
every weekend. So it was only natural that when she got her
driver's license, she wanted do more than just tool around the
roads of central Massachusetts, where rotaries during rush hour
offer the most excitement.
</P>
<P>
   So she borrowed her mother's Chevy Lumina to start drag racing
in the trophy class _ for regular street cars _ and raced at 76
miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   She kept racing in that class, and moved up to an '84 Corvette
that she revved up to 85 miles an hour and in 1994 won the National
Hot Rod Association Sears/Craftsman Scholarship award and was named
the New England Dragway Rookie of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997 _ after Willard had taken apart that motor _ she had
moved up a class and was racing a Super Comp Baretta at speeds of
160 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   She went on the the University of New Hampshire, from which she
graduated last May with a degree in psychology, but her eye was
still on the racetrack. And the eyes of the Hanna race Team were on
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard about her from someone at Lebanon Valley Dragway, and
met with her and her family and made the decision to add her to our
team,'' said Al Hanna, who with his son, Richard, run the Hanna
Motorsports team.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did she have the drive and ability, he said, but being
female was a plus. ``She adds to the marketability.'' In fact,
after naming the car ``Queen of Diamonds,'' he got a sponsorship
with the Bicycle Division of the US Playing Card Company.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna said that he and his son, both jet dragster racers, took
about a year to train Willard in the car that was like none other
she had driven.
</P>
<P>
   They took a rear-view mirror so she could see the smoke and
flames that flared out up to 30-feet long on the back of the car
when she fired up the engine. The flames are to both put on a show
and to burn off fuel and make the car lighter to race.
</P>
<P>
   The engine _ the kind in an F-5 fighter jet _ is so loud that
when Willard fired up the race car last Friday morning outside the
Bayside Expo, the state police thought an explosion had gone off
and came rushing to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna spent the next months training Willard how to hold onto
the butterfly-steering wheel and release the throttle when the
starting lights signal it's time to go. And he had some terse words
of advice for Willard in case her two main parachutes and the
reserve one didn't go off to make her brake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to her, `just drive your blank off, and if you don't
have parachutes, just keep driving.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I did it I went 60 feet and shut the car off,''
Willard said. ``It was so fast, before I even knew I was scared, I
was at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   But she obviously got in again and again, and is now the only
active female jet dragster racer in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Willard got her jet car license last June, and has since chalked
up several track records. Perhaps the most exceptional one was when
she covered the quarter-mile track at Englishtown (N.J.) Raceway
Park in 5.08 seconds at 305 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   In August, after she had been racing only six weeks, Willard won
jet car races at the New England Dragway in Epping, N.H., and at
the Jet Car Nationals in Englishtown, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``She beats the boys, she beats them all,'' Hanna said. ``She's
beating everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Willard, who has a boyfriend (and yes, he races), said she's
been the target of both good and bad attention as a woman in a
male-dominated sport. She just shrugs it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a while, after I race them they won't talk to me, but
that's kind of to be expected,'' she said. ``I don't think it's
because I'm a woman, either, I just think it's because our team is
very respected.''
</P>
<P>
   And the notice she gets isn't just from other racers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of marriage proposals this year, most of them
yelling from the grandstand,'' Willard said, laughing. ``A few come
up and they offer their friends' for marriage, stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Willard acknowledges that she had a less-than conventional
childhood that was centered around racetracks, first to watch her
parents drive, then to race herself.
</P>
<P>
   She and her brother, Nick, would play with toy cars, or play
catch on the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd stop the game when my dad was racing and go watch, then
go back to our games,'' Willard said. ``We used to color Easter
eggs there, and most of my major birthdays were at the racetrack.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In high school, she said, friends wondered why she took off
every weekeend. Even though she played on the field hockey and
softball teams, she couldn't practice on Saturdays because she was
traveling to racetracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't really get it,'' Willard said. ``But they were all
thrilled for me when I won the high school race. When I came back
on Monday they announced it over the intercom to the whole school,
and everybody was really excited for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Willard, who was a senior at the time, didn't get prize money
for the win, but was given $1,000 for her school. She donated half
to the school library, and half to the automotive trade department.
</P>
<P>
   Now that she's in her racing offseason, Willard is using her
psychology degree to work with a first-grader with Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. And she spends about two to three
hours a day in the gym learning boxing ``as a hobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, she has thought about taking up skydiving,
flying, and would love to go up with the Blue Angels. As for a
career, Willard said she aspires to teach, but wants to stay in
drag racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to use drag racing as a tool, to get the kids'
attention,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That shouldn't be a problem.

PHONE CALL IS FREE, ONCE YOU'VE LISTENED

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Maryland company is offering consumers free calls to anywhere
in the United States _ if the caller is willing to listen to an
advertisement first.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is similar to radio or television. Listeners don't
pay for each song or news report they hear on the radio;
advertisers do. And advertisers will foot the bill for BroadPoint
Communications of Landover, Md., to offer callers two free minutes
of long-distance service for every 10- to 15-second ad they listen
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to completely refresh the telecommunications
industry and at the same time launch a new medium for
advertising,'' said Perry Kamel, president of BroadPoint, which is
rolling out the service nationally with DQE Inc., a Pennsylvania
energy services company.
</P>
<P>
   Broadpoint's FreeWay service is not for someone in a hurry, but
Kamel said a test in Pittsburgh last year found that callers with a
little extra time on their hands were happy to trade it for free
long-distance minutes. More than 10,000 people signed up for the
service during the Pittsburgh test.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty advertisers have bought into the concept, including
Blockbuster Entertainment, Acura, Rolex, the Wall Street Journal
and Sports Illustrated. Relying on questionnaires that FreeWay
members are required to fill out, advertisers are guaranteed that
their ads will reach their target market. The service even allows
callers who want more information after hearing an ad to connect
directly to the advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   Kamel, who previously was head of strategy at MCI WorldCom's
mass markets division, said advertisers pay BroadPoint between 6
cents and 24 cents for delivering each message to a customer. The
rate varies depending on how closely the caller fits the
advertiser's demographic requirements and whether the caller can
connect directly to the advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   BroadPoint buys long-distance time at discounted rates from one
of the nation's top three long-distance companies. Kamel declined
to say whether his long-distance supplier was AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom or
Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for AT&AMP;T, which relies on the traditional
pay-per-minute long-distance model, said the firm was following
BroadPoint's venture closely. ``We are watching this segment of
calling. However, I cannot speculate as to whether we will offer a
service such as this in the future,'' said Andy Boisseau.
</P>
<P>
   The only way currently to sign up for FreeWay is to go to
www.broadpoint.com and fill out an application and demographic
survey. Enrollment is free currently, but an email address and a
touch-tone phone are required.
</P>
<P>
   Broadpoint says the demographic information will not be provided
to unrelated third parties, although it will be used to link
advertisers and callers. Demographic questions focus on age,
educational background, work status, income, hobbies and other
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Once accepted, FreeWay members receive a card with instructions
on how to make a call. Callers dial a toll-free number to hook up
with Broadpoint, punch in their home phone number plus a four-digit
PIN number and dial the number they are calling.
</P>
<P>
   The first ad comes on immediately. At its conclusion, you can
then press the phone's star button to hear another ad and receive
another two minutes of calling time, or press the pound button to
connect the long-distance call you want to make. Kamel said the
Pittsburgh test indicated the typical caller listens to about seven
ads and builds up 14 minutes of calling time.
</P>
<P>
   With some advertisers, callers can also punch zero and be
connected directly to the advertiser. After you finish talking to
the advertiser, you can press the star button again and be returned
to FreeWay.
</P>
<P>
   If a caller doesn't use all of his minutes on a call, the
minutes cannot be banked and are lost. Callers are notified that
their time is about to expire 30 seconds before the end of the
call.
</P>
<P>
   FreeWay is currently restricted to US calls only, but Kamel said
he is working on expanding the calling area to include
international calls.
</P>
<P>
   Kamel said surveys of those who joined in Pittsburgh revealed a
membership that would be very attractive to advertisers. He said
most participants had children and an average household income of
$60,000.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for BroadPoint said there were enough varied
advertisers participating in FreeWay so no one would be rejected
for membership because they failed to meet certain demographic
criteria. But BroadPoint is cautioning that membership may be
delayed if response to the national rollout is bigger than
expected.

 &HT;    ONE YEAR LATER, A MIXED RECORD FOR STATE OF THE UNION AGENDA
 &HT;    With UNION. For release Sunday, Jan. 17.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton prepares a list of proposals
for his State of the Union address Tuesday, many of his goals from
a year ago have not been accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Save Social Security first'' was the most memorable phrase
from the 1998 speech. The president vowed to reserve ``every
penny'' of the expected budget surplus until the Social Security
system was made stronger.
</P>
<P>
   With the treasury collecting its first surplus in three decades,
Clinton has declared his promise to be fulfilled. However, many
budget watchers have cried foul because the president and Congress
forged a plan to use $20 billion of the surplus funds for
``emergency'' spending.
</P>
<P>
   The record on other proposals in the 1998 speech is mixed:
</P>
<P>
   FULFILLED
</P>
<P>
   _ The ``largest funding increase in history'' for the National
Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. Congress
agreed and added even more for health research.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increased International Monetary Fund contributions, totalling
$18 billion, to help bail out ailing foreign economies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expanding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to include
Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republican to the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization. The Senate easily ratified the plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ An overhaul of the Internal Revenue Service. Congress
completed and the president signed a measure, initiated by the
Republicans and later embraced by Clinton, that pledges to make the
tax collecting agency more helpful and less dictatorial.
</P>
<P>
   RECEIVED PARTIAL ACTION
</P>
<P>
   _ ``An ambitious agenda to reduce the serious threat of weapons
of mass destruction.'' In a year of tension in this area, Clinton
ordered air strikes of suspected arsenals and arms factories in
Iraq, but U.S. officials acknowledged they could not determine how
much weapons production was affected. The strikes ended the United
Nations inspections role in Iraq, at least for the foreseeable
future.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, North Korea fired a ballistic missile test over
Japan. India shocked the world, including U.S. intelligence
agencies, by exploding a nuclear bomb, and Pakistan soon followed,
despite Clinton's efforts to dissuade its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``From Belfast to Korea to the Middle East, America will
continue to stand with those who stand for peace.'' Clinton
administration efforts helped produce the Good Friday agreement to
end the sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. But Clinton's
effort to broker an interim peace accord between the Israelis and
Palestinians unraveled soon after it was signed.
</P>
<P>
   _ 100,000 new teachers to help reduce class size in primary
schools. In a last-minute budget deal with Congress last October,
the president won $1.2 billion to hire about 30,000 new teachers
starting next fall.
</P>
<P>
   _ Environmental spending increases, including ``a far-reaching
effort'' to clean up rivers, lakes and coastlines as well as reduce
fossil fuel emissions. The White House asked for $1.1 billion in
increased funding, and Congress granted $714 million in last fall's
annual budget. A Clinton plan to grant tax cuts of $6 billion over
five years for the research and development of fuel-efficient homes
and cars did not pass.
</P>
<P>
   RECEIVED NO ACTION
</P>
<P>
   _ An increase in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   _ National standardized testing for schools. The exams for 4th
and 8th graders, first promised in 1997, have yet to be designed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Construction money to build or remodel 5,000 schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ A consumer ``bill of rights'' for health care to give patients
more control in choosing doctors and treatment provided by
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allowing people between the ages of 55 and 65 who have lost
their private health insurance to purchase Medicare coverage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Raising cigarette taxes by $1.50 a pack to discourage teen
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   _ Major new tax cuts and new federal spending for day care.
Without the tobacco tax increase to pay for it, this plan was
dropped. However, Clinton won $200 million in new funding for
after-school activities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Campaign finance reform. This perennial request died once
again in the Republican-led Congress.
</P>
<P>
   _ Special authority to negotiate international trade pacts.
Congress rejected the measure, a mainstay of the Clinton foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Payment of overdue debt to the United Nations. Clinton vetoed
the $900 million bill because Congress attached a measure to ban
federal aid to agencies that lobby for abortion rights in foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>

   PHOENIX - Fear not, fellow and sister foodies. Follow me into
battle. Today, we tackle the Yeast Beast, one of the most
beneficial yet somehow frightening denizens of the food world.
Otherwise-good cooks tremble and turn the cookbook page at the very
word yeast. Fear not! The Yeast Beast can be yours.
</P>
<P>
   The Yeast Beast, once tamed, makes a wonderful pet. The Yeast
Beast will perform tricks at your command, make your home smell
terrific and bring you the happy glow of successful baking.
</P>
<P>
   The Yeast Beast is alive. Seriously. Yeast is a one-cell plant,
identified as a living organism by Louis Pasteur in 1857. Like a
seed that needs to be planted, watered and warmed to grow, the
Yeast Beast sits in your cupboard (or, better yet, your freezer)
waiting for you to give it something warm, wet and edible. After
it's put to work, the Yeast Beast eats sugars and gives off carbon
dioxide and ethyl alcohol, gases that expand when trapped in a
gluten network.
</P>
<P>
   Gluten is strands of protein that form when wheat flour and
water are mixed together. As dough is kneaded, gluten strands stick
together in stretchy bands, and the yeast divides, grows, eats more
sugars and gives off more bubbles that blow up the gluten. Poof.
The Yeast Beast works, and the bread rises.
</P>
<P>
   Flours contain varying amounts of protein (and gluten), which is
why bakers learn to choose certain flours for certain jobs. In
general, high-protein flours are best for products that need lots
of gluten for strength and elasticity, such as bread, cream puffs,
puff pastry, pizza and pasta. Semolina is the first choice for most
pastas.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, low-protein flours, made from wheat grown in
the South and widely used there, make great cakes, quick breads,
muffins, pancakes, gravies, pie crusts and biscuits _ all of which
need tenderness and little gluten, leavened as they are by baking
powder and baking soda. (Brand names: Swansdown and Softasilk cake
flours; Shake &AMP; Blend and Wondra Instant Flours for gravies;
bleached Southern all-purpose flours such as White Lily, Martha
White, Gladiola and Red Band for pie crusts, quick breads, muffins,
biscuits).
</P>
<P>
   In ``CookWise,'' Shirley Corriher explains that national brands
of bleached all-purpose flour have a little too much protein for
the best pie crusts and not quite enough protein for outstanding
yeast breads. However, she says, ``unbleached'' all-purpose
national brands of flour are blended to contain more protein,
enough for the Yeast Beast to work well.
</P>
<P>
   Only wheat has the ability to form lots of gluten, which is why
white flour is often combined with rye, barley and all those other
grains to make bread. The bran in whole-wheat flour, the outer
layer of the grain of wheat, is sharp enough to cut gluten strands
and thus doesn't rise as much.
</P>
<P>
   Yeast, wheat flour, water: These are the basics of bread. Now
you need . . . technique.
</P>
<P>
   You can make bread dough in a bread machine set on the dough
cycle, in a heavy-duty mixer with a dough hook, in a food processor
or by hand.
</P>
<P>
   If you have any one of those machines, use it, by all means. A
bread machine makes a superior dough, and you can pull it out of
the machine to have the joy of shaping and baking without working
up a sweat while kneading. Instruction booklets for your appliances
should give details of how to adapt recipes; there are several
excellent cookbooks to consult, too.
</P>
<P>
   When you've made dough by hand, however, you will understand all
the nuances _ and all the confusing terms. In all recipes, it's
important to read through them first before starting to cook, but
in bread recipes, it's critical.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe for French Bread in 201YEAST-RECIPES describes all
the steps in detail, with a few flourishes from the person who gave
it to us a few years ago: Nancy Johnson, who developed this recipe
at home before she opened her highly successful bakery,
BreadCrafters, in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Along with kneading the dough and giving it rest periods,
Johnson slams the dough around to develop the gluten. It works. You
can slam, or you can knead continuously. With time, you, the
successful tamer of the Yeast Beast, will develop your own tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's recipe describes the sequence of kneading: fold, push,
quarter-turn. But there really is no right or wrong way to knead.
What you want to do is manipulate the dough for some minutes until
you feel it begin to change right under your hands into a silky
ball. It's then ready to rise in a greased bowl, covered with your
best kitchen towel.
</P>
<P>
   Most recipes call for two rises, starting right after kneading,
until the dough ``has doubled in size.'' How do you tell when it
has doubled? If you know the volume of your bowl, you can tell when
it's risen from the 4-quart mark to the 8-quart mark. The first
rise generally takes an hour, after which the bread is deflated to
let the air out (it's always fun to sock your fist into the middle
of the mass). The bread is then shaped and left to rise a second
time, which usually takes half the time of the first rise, around
30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal conditions that your Yeast Beasts need to give off gas
and rise are in a warm, draft-free place. The kitchen towel keeps
the crust from hardening. You don't want the crust to harden until
after it's in the oven. And for this recipe, you want to make a
crisp, crackly crust.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson achieves that by misting the oven with water to make
steam and with a baking stone, which is preheated to simulate the
brick-line ovens in which artisan breads are baked. (Yes! This is
an artisan bread!) Baking stones draw out moisture from the crust
as it cooks, making it crisp.
</P>
<P>
   Stones are flat slabs, often round because they are so excellent
for pizza crust. Look for them in kitchen and department stores.
The only thing you have to watch is that they don't go from hot to
cold quickly, which might crack them. Preheat stones in a hot oven
for about 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Loaves are slashed after they have fully risen and just before
going in the oven to release interior steam that will otherwise
blow out a side or end of the loaf. Use a single-edge razor blade
or a really sharp knife and cut quickly.
</P>
<P>
   When the bread goes into the oven, the gases give one last jump
after they hit the heated air inside. This is called ``oven
spring,'' and it's the last gasp of the Yeast Beast before it dies
in the heat, having given its all. This is why your oven must be
preheated _ to promote oven spring.
</P>
<P>
   How do you tell when the bread is done? For one thing, the crust
should be really brown, not just a little brown. Recipes tell you
that a thumped loaf sounds hollow, but until you develop an ear for
that sound, or if you're tone-deaf, use an instant-read
thermometer, to measure the interior temperature of the loaf. This
French bread is done when the internal temperature is 200 degrees;
most breads are done around 190 degrees. Take the loaf out, turn it
sideways onto a cooling rack and insert the thermometer's stem into
the bottom of the loaf. If it doesn't register high enough, return
it to the oven for a few more minutes.
</P>
<P>
   As you can see from Johnson's recipe variations, you can delay,
slow down or otherwise manipulate the Yeast Beast to work on your
schedule. You can also tell that between the rest periods and the
rising of the dough, there are many times that the dough is just
sitting there, doing its thing while you do something else around
the house, such as laundry.
</P>
<P>
   All the Yeast Beast needs is a little warmth, something to eat,
gluten protein to blow up like bubble gum, and your hands or a
machine, kneading it into silky submission. The Yeast Beast can be
cranky, yes, but work with it. Practice. One bite of your first
good loaf, and the Yeast Beast is yours for life. &QL;

LET'S REVIEW BAKING BASICS 
</HEADLINE>

 ByJUDY WALKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Brief points for baking success from ``The Arizona
Republic's'' Cooking 101 series: &QL; 
- Measure accurately for baking success. You need different
measuring cups for liquids and dry ingredients. Flat-topped
measuring cups are made to be filled to the top with dry stuff.
Liquid measures are usually glass, with more space at the top to
eliminate spills, and a pour spout. &QL; 
- To measure flour, stir the flour first. Gently spoon flour into
the (flat-topped) measuring cup while held over a sheet of waxed
paper or the flour canister. Do not tap it or shake it to level the
flour. Let the flour heap up. When the flour is over the top, use
the flat side of a knife or spatula to level off the top of the
cup. &QL; 
- Preheated ovens are critical in baking. Most ovens will preheat
in 10 to 20 minutes. &QL; 
- Whole wheat is heavier than white flour. You can substitute up to
half of the flour amount in an all-white-flour recipe with
whole-wheat flour. &QL;

I LEFT MY BALLPARK IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Someday archaeologists will dig up heaps of old
newspapers and conclude that San Francisco was a city obsessed not
with sex, not with beauty or style, not with food or restaurants,
not even with itself, but with ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   It's very odd that politically correct San Francisco is obsessed
with stadiums rather than food, sex or world peace. It's like
discovering that Dallas is a city obsessed with social justice
rather than social climbing.
</P>
<P>
   The Stadiazoic period of San Francisco began in the early 1980s
when then-Giants owner Bob Lurie said Candlestick Park was no
longer adequate and started moping for a new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   To appease Lurie, public officials drew up plans for ballparks
all along the shore of San Francisco, shared ballparks with
Oakland, ballparks near the airport, in Santa Clara and near dumps
in Milpitas.
</P>
<P>
   At one point a plan for a floating ballpark was floated.
</P>
<P>
   The area was littered with imaginary ballparks, while
journalists built entire careers writing about them. Politicians
threw away their political capital trying to get ballparks built.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after a brilliant campaign, the voters gave the Giants
their ballpark. What a jewel it will be when it's finished, and in
such a setting, with the Bay glistening on one side and brightly
hued traffic jams on the other.
</P>
<P>
   This week, San Francisco's ballpark obsession flared up again _
about the proposed 49ers stadium and shopping mall. Yes, that's
what our mayor wants, even though a stadium-mall in San Francisco
makes as much sense as a croquet lawn-vegetarian restaurant in
Muleshoe, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The headlines sounded like medical reports from Generalissimo
Francisco Franco's bedside. Depending on which newspaper you read,
the stadium-mall was still dead, or still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The project is moving forward in the same fashion it has for
the last two months,'' a spokesman for the 49ers told the San
Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   And Generalissimo Francisco Franco has shown just as much
movement.
</P>
<P>
   All that matters for Mayor Willie Brown is that the stadium-mall
survive on the resuscitator, or at least stay alive as an idea,
until after the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has put a lot of his prestige on the line for this
ungainly concept, combining The Gap and Wet Seal with beer-sodden
fans and tailgates outside a multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   If the stadium-mall completely, certifiably dies before the
election, what will Brown have? A lot of homeless people still on
the streets, a gold dome on a poorly computerized $300 million City
Hall and a flea market on Treasure Island.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody might even dare to run against him.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the 49ers have something to do with the intensity of
the current weirdness. The hard-core fans are basically a cult,
expecting nothing less than perfection.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are religion, sports, family and politics rolled into
one sputtered-out offense.
</P>
<P>
   Talk-radio conversations and letters to the editor about the
Niners sound like debates about how many angels can run pass
patterns on the head of a pin _ as debated by pinheads.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder San Francisco is stuck on its nonexistent
stadium-mall, even though many people in this town avoid both
stadiums and malls as if they're on the same boycott list as
Starbucks and Coors.
</P>
<P>
   I guess I'm just a typical fan, one who watches most of the
games on television and doesn't plan to do a lot of shopping after
paying a couple of hundred bucks on tickets, parking, hot dogs and
beer.
</P>
<P>
   Let them play in Candlestick, as long as they play. Who cares
about luxury boxes and getting a Super Bowl? Those are for other
people, and not the kind of people who live in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it doesn't look like the Niners will be in a Super Bowl
for a while. Not to argue theology with you.

BOOKSTORES SEE THEIR CAUSE IN `YOU'VE GOT MAIL'' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail'' is an enticing first kiss of a film, with
stars Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks as irresistible as free puppies
outside a store and New York City looking like a flower-bedecked
nirvana, which is why audiences are falling hard for this season's
most popular romantic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one group of people who watch ``You've Got Mail''
and see something other than Hollywood romance. Never mind the
``Somewhere Over the Rainbow'' romantics of Nora Ephron's film.
Independent booksellers focus more on the movie's subplot and feel
as though they are watching their own funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``You've Got Mail'' is the first popular entertainment
to focus on the plight of embattled independent booksellers as they
try to survive the tidal wave of chain superstores (Barnes &AMP; Noble,
Borders) along with such online competitors as Seattle-based
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tense battle that has involved not only a war of words,
but also lawsuits as independent booksellers have taken their case
to court, alleging that chain superstores have engaged in unfair
trade practices and extracted favoritism from publishers.
</P>
<P>
   The chains still march on. In six years, independent booksellers
have gone from selling one-third of the books in this country to
half that percentage and many beloved independents have closed,
including the recent demise of the Printers Inc. bookstore in Palo
Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   So while other viewers feel a tug at their heartstrings as the
Ryan and Hanks characters perform their wise-cracking mating
ritual, booksellers brush away tears as the adorable little
children's bookstore run by Ryan's character (Kathleen Kelly) is
imperiled by a chain superstore run by Hanks' character (Joe Fox).
</P>
<P>
   The fictional Fox &AMP; Sons Books (carbon copy of a Barnes &AMP; Noble)
muscles its way into the same Manhattan neighborhood, offering it
trademark mix of what Fox laughing describes as ``cheap books and
legal addictive stimulants.'' And in about six months, a sign goes
up on the front door of The Shop Around the Corner, which was
started by Kelly's mother and had been in the family ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 42 years,'' the sign announces, ``we are closing. We
have loved being a part of your lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie made me feel very sad about what is happening in our
business,'' admits Carol Santaro, co-owner of the Fremont Place
bookstore in Seattle. ``We were both thankful the film brings out
these issues, especially for those who might not be aware.''
</P>
<P>
   ```You've Got Mail' does portray many of the problems for
independent bookstores in this country,'' says Paul Hanson, manager
of Eagle Harbor Book Co. on Bainbridge Island, Wash. ``Meg Ryan's
bookstore did close in the movie and that's the plight of a lot of
bookstores these days.''
</P>
<P>
   The bookselling duel in the film _ which representatives at
Barnes &AMP; Noble's headquarters in New York City declined to discuss
_ is perhaps nowhere better mirrored in the Seattle area than in
the bustling environs of University Village shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   There, a two-level Barnes &AMP; Noble superstore, already having
supplanted the long-established Kay's Bookmark, draws a steady
crowd of customers, who stroll through its wide aisles and sprawl
in its overstuffed chairs as the upbeat elevator music of
``Guantanamera'' plays over loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   The upstairs children's section at Barnes &AMP; Noble is a showcase
of big bucks being spent to attract little customers (and their
parents), with huge cardboard cutouts of favorite characters from
children's books, as well as tiny tables and stools and some kid
Adirondack chairs. From the picture windows in the department can
be seen University Village shops and parking lots and not far
beyond them, a bright blue shape. It turns out to be the awning on
the front of a small bookstore for children _ All for Kids Books
and Music.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, owner Chauni Haslet presides over a thriving independent
of 4,000 square feet that sprawls through several rooms of varying
shapes and sizes. It is a homespun, handwritten notes, crazy quilt
kind of place.
</P>
<P>
   Haslet's attitude mirrors that of Ryan's character in the film.
While Kelly derides her chain-store competition as a ``theme park,
multilevel mocha-cino land,'' Haslet simply refers to hers by its
initials, which she jokes stand for ``Big &AMP; Nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   ```You've Got Mail' is remarkably true, although it is
unfortunate that Tom Hanks makes the big guys look really
lovable,'' Haslet says. ``That's not the sense I have of the big
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old bookstore owner is not just spouting off. She
has already felt the muscle of the chains, closing a second
location in suburban Issaquah when a Barnes &AMP; Noble was opening
there (one of several factors in the closing). She decided to
concentrate all her energies on the University District store,
moving aggressively to continue its success.
</P>
<P>
   She expanded All for Kids into an adjoining storefront and
hosted a series of daily events for four months prior to the
opening at Barnes &AMP; Noble. These measures were intended to draw
traffic, convey properousness and foster customer loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   All for Kids, already chock-full of products related to kid
books (from plush characters to music to art), even added a section
of adult books (all read and recommended by staffers) as a kind of
living memorial to the defunct Kay's Bookmark. All for Kids may
indeed be the only children's bookstore in the country to stock a
novel by Thomas Pynchon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that if we had stayed small, not as visible, with not
as much window space, we would not be in existence,'' says Haslet,
who has 16 years' experience in the book business. ``Any time an
independent sees a chain coming and does not make adjustments,
they're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what happened to The Shop Around the Corner in
``You've Got Mail.'' Kelly counts on her customers' loyalty, but
sales continue to plummet each day that Fox Books is open. Even a
blitz of favorable media coverage about the little store's plight _
a battle depicted as ``Joan of Arc against Attila the Hun'' _
cannot stem the bleeding of red ink.
</P>
<P>
   After the frantic going-out-of-business sale, Kelly returns to
the shop one last time and surveys its empty shelves. She admits,
``I feel as if a part of me has died. I feel the way I did when my
mother died all over again and no one can make it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent booksellers hope that sympathy for The Shop Around
the Corner will be transferred to their own stores. The American
Booksellers Association in Tarrytown, N.Y., distributed free movie
tickets to booksellers in major cities and sent special ``You've
Got Mail'' posters to its members, posters that included the
additional lines: ``Independent Bookstores for Independent Minds''
and ``Visit the shop around YOUR corner.''
</P>
<P>
   As Len Vlahos, spokesman for the 3,300-member association,
stresses, ``The movie has done what we anticipated _ it raises
issues about independent bookstores that many people in the public
may never have considered. So this helps, whether we happen to
agree with how things are depicted in this Hollywood film. It
raises consciousness and gets people talking, so we felt that our
members needed to be connected to `You've Got Mail.'''
</P>
<P>
   The connection is already paying some dividends at small
independents in the Seattle area. Booksellers may complain that The
Shop Around the Corner is too cute to be real, and that Kelly
starts a new career much too easily after her store closes.
</P>
<P>
   But those complaints have been muted by real customers who have
come into their real stores, bought books and expressed support
because of having seen the film.
</P>
<P>
   It is only a trickle of customers, thus far, but independent
booksellers are grateful for any encouragement they can get these
days.

   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's lawyers file
a brief of more than 100 pages in preparation for opening arguments
Thursday in the Senate impeachment trial. (Deans, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   OTHER IMPEACHMENT SIDEBARS
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-JURORS _ WASHINGTON _ Breakdown on various blocs among
the senators and who viewers should watch for: Northeast GOP
moderates targeted by Dems (Collins, Chaffee, Jeffords, Snowe) GOP
pragmatists (Lott, McConnell); hardliners, Senators facing
elections (and likely to keep a low profile), etc. (Foskett,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-BARR _ WAHINGTON _ Bob Barr's job as a House manager is
to persuade Senators to see the merits of the case against
President Clinton. But, in the weeks before the trial, Barr has
gone out of his way to insult these jurors, questioning both their
attention spans and backbone. (Carr, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-WORLD _ MOSCOW _ As opening arguments begin today(Jan.
14) in the Senate trial of American President Bill Clinton, is the
world still paying attention? Or are they growing more weary of
this saga than the American public? Developing. (Foreign staff, Cox
News Service).
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-TV _ You say you're tired of the Clinton scandal. You
can't stand to watch a second more. But watch you will. Ratings are
up across the board on CNN, MSNBC, Fox News Channel and more for
Clinton coverage. (Jubera, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-TVBOX _ Where to watch it, and what you'll see. (Jubera,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-CHABOT _ WASHINGTON _ When Ohio's Rep. Steve Chabot made
his living as a lawyer, he was the legal equivalent of the family
doctor. Advertised in the Yellow Pages, Chabot's one-man law office
handled cases across the legal spectrum from criminal defense to
divorce court. It was a mix of work Chabot categorizes under the
heading of ``whatever came in the door.'' But now, Chabot's legal
profile is about to rise. Just weeks into his third term in
Congress, this former elementary school teacher is part of the team
of prosecutors that on Thursday will begin presenting a case for
removing President Clinton from office. (Montgomery, Dayton Daily
News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   DISABLED-ADDICTS _ WASHINGTON _ Drunks and addicts can become
disabled. Disabled people can abuse alcohol or drugs. On Wednesday,
a federal panel of physicians and other professionals releases a
new ``treatment protocol'' _ advice to their peers on successful
methods of treating someone with this particularly frustrating
combination of symptoms. Recovering substance abusers who are
disabled will be there to comment. (Mollison, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   Cox photos for this story will be placed in the National folder
on the Cox server.

   MICROSOFT _ WASHINGTON _ Continuing spot coverage of the federal
antitrust trial against Microsoft Corp. (Glass, Cox News Service).

</P>
<P>
   BUSH-D0LE-PRESIDENCY _ CONCORD, N.H. _ Years after other
potential GOP presidential candidates began campaigning in this
bellwether state, two noncampaigners have jumped way ahead of the
pack. In results that confirm speculation that noncandidate
Elizabeth Dole could provide the most serious challenge to
noncandidate George W. Bush, a Manchester TV station poll gives
Dole a slight edge among New Hampshire Republicans, but within the
margin of error. Bush and Dole both have said they are undecided on
a presidential candidacy. Dole got a bump in the polls last week
after she resigned as president of the American Red Cross.
Political leaders here expect them both to run. (Herman, Austin
American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   CLEAN-MARSH (developing) _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The federal
government helped craft Florida's $763 million Everglades cleanup
plan, but five years later the project still lacks a federal
permit. Now the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is offering a
permit, but it has all kinds of strings that South Florida water
managers and the sugar industry object to. Among them: super-strict
rules on how much polluting phosphorus the cleansed water may
contain. The feds say they'll relax the rules if research later
shows that the Everglades can take more phosphorus, but the growers
say they smell a trap. Meanwhile, environmental groups say the
strict rules are needed to keep the state and sugar from colluding
on a ``cleanup'' that leaves the Everglades polluted. Sugar growers
will urge the water managers today to either reject the permit or
seek big changes. (King, Palm Beach Post).
</P>
<P>
   SMOKE-MONEY (developing) _ Lawyers who represented Florida in
its successful lawsuit against tobacco money are meeting in Orlando
to decide how much of their fees to give to the Lawton and Rhea
Chiles Center for Healthy Mothers and Babies, and other charities.
Lawton Chiles, who died last month, pushed for the lawsuit while
governor of Florida. (Hiaasen, Palm Beach Post).
</P>
<P>
   NEW-BISHOP _ PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. _ Anthony J. O'Connell
becomes the third bishop of the Diocese of Palm Beach today in
investiture services at the cathedral. Gushee spends time with him
in Knoxville, Tenn., on his last weekend in that diocese and writes
a profile, laced with color and comments from the parishioners
there. (Gushee, Palm Beach Post). 74. WITH PHOTOS.

   WELFARE _ An Ohio Senator is taking Bob Taft to task over his
inaugural example of a welfare reform success story. Taft
highlighted the succes of a Dayton woman, Shannon Stavis, who went
from welfare to work with training at Miami Jacobs College. State
Sen. Fingerhut says under GOP sponsored welfare reform Stavis could
not have gotten her benefits while going to schools. (Jasper,
Dayton Daily News). WITH PHOTO.

   FLA-DRUG-MOVIE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ While the students at
Lake Worth High School were being held to a strict ``Zero
Tolerance'' anti-drug policy last week, Palm Beach County's film
commission was unwittingly helping a low-budget film crew shoot a
comic drug deal in one of the school's bathrooms. ``Dave's Day
Out'' begins when Dave buys some marijuana in the bathroom. (Hayes,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TIRED-MAILMAN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Maybe rain or sleet can't stop
postal workers _ but what if they're tired? A former mail carrier
has been charged with keeping and opening 30,383 letters and
packages, including 208 parcels _ and authorities are holding it
all as evidence until the case is closed. James S. Wynn, 54, faces
a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, is charged
in U.S. District Court in Dayton in a bill of information. (Hills,
Dayton Daily News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   OHIO-SCHOOL-SNOWDAYS _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Local school officials can
expect a chilly reception if they go to the Ohio legislature
seeking additional snow days. Some lawmakers who would have to
approve any increase in the number of calamity days granted school
districts said they did not think an extension was likely.
(Bebbington, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   STATE LEGISLATIVE NEWS
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-BUDGET _ State spending would creep above the $90 billion
mark for 200-2001, under a budget plan proposed by legislative
leaders. The Legislative Budget Board spending plan, widely
considered the blueprint for the state budget, would increase
spending 3.8 percent overall and 6 percent in general fund
expenditures, which are those funded by taxes. (E;izondo, Austin
American-Statesman).

PHONE CALL IS FREE, ONCE YOU'VE LISTENED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Maryland company is offering consumers free calls to anywhere
in the United States _ if the caller is willing to listen to an
advertisement first.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is similar to radio or television. Listeners don't
pay for each song or news report they hear on the radio;
advertisers do. And advertisers will foot the bill for BroadPoint
Communications of Landover, Md., to offer callers two free minutes
of long-distance service for every 10- to 15-second ad they listen
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to completely refresh the telecommunications
industry and at the same time launch a new medium for
advertising,'' said Perry Kamel, president of BroadPoint, which is
rolling out the service nationally with DQE Inc., a Pennsylvania
energy services company.
</P>
<P>
   Broadpoint's FreeWay service is not for someone in a hurry, but
Kamel said a test in Pittsburgh last year found that callers with a
little extra time on their hands were happy to trade it for free
long-distance minutes. More than 10,000 people signed up for the
service during the Pittsburgh test.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty advertisers have bought into the concept, including
Blockbuster Entertainment, Acura, Rolex, the Wall Street Journal
and Sports Illustrated. Relying on questionnaires that FreeWay
members are required to fill out, advertisers are guaranteed that
their ads will reach their target market. The service even allows
callers who want more information after hearing an ad to connect
directly to the advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   Kamel, who previously was head of strategy at MCI WorldCom's
mass markets division, said advertisers pay BroadPoint between 6
cents and 24 cents for delivering each message to a customer. The
rate varies depending on how closely the caller fits the
advertiser's demographic requirements and whether the caller can
connect directly to the advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   BroadPoint buys long-distance time at discounted rates from one
of the nation's top three long-distance companies. Kamel declined
to say whether his long-distance supplier was AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom or
Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for AT&AMP;T, which relies on the traditional
pay-per-minute long-distance model, said the firm was following
BroadPoint's venture closely. ``We are watching this segment of
calling. However, I cannot speculate as to whether we will offer a
service such as this in the future,'' said Andy Boisseau.
</P>
<P>
   The only way currently to sign up for FreeWay is to go to
www.broadpoint.com and fill out an application and demographic
survey. Enrollment is free currently, but an email address and a
touch-tone phone are required.
</P>
<P>
   Broadpoint says the demographic information will not be provided
to unrelated third parties, although it will be used to link
advertisers and callers. Demographic questions focus on age,
educational background, work status, income, hobbies and other
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Once accepted, FreeWay members receive a card with instructions
on how to make a call. Callers dial a toll-free number to hook up
with Broadpoint, punch in their home phone number plus a four-digit
PIN number and dial the number they are calling.
</P>
<P>
   The first ad comes on immediately. At its conclusion, you can
then press the phone's star button to hear another ad and receive
another two minutes of calling time, or press the pound button to
connect the long-distance call you want to make. Kamel said the
Pittsburgh test indicated the typical caller listens to about seven
ads and builds up 14 minutes of calling time.
</P>
<P>
   With some advertisers, callers can also punch zero and be
connected directly to the advertiser. After you finish talking to
the advertiser, you can press the star button again and be returned
to FreeWay.
</P>
<P>
   If a caller doesn't use all of his minutes on a call, the
minutes cannot be banked and are lost. Callers are notified that
their time is about to expire 30 seconds before the end of the
call.
</P>
<P>
   FreeWay is currently restricted to US calls only, but Kamel said
he is working on expanding the calling area to include
international calls.
</P>
<P>
   Kamel said surveys of those who joined in Pittsburgh revealed a
membership that would be very attractive to advertisers. He said
most participants had children and an average household income of
$60,000.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for BroadPoint said there were enough varied
advertisers participating in FreeWay so no one would be rejected
for membership because they failed to meet certain demographic
criteria. But BroadPoint is cautioning that membership may be
delayed if response to the national rollout is bigger than
expected.

   LOS ANGELES _ Fortunately enough, for a woman who spent several
years of her life being an angel, Ellen McLaughlin never has had a
fear of flying.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of McLaughlin's earliest and best memories is of
her first plane trip with her parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I went up, when I was a little girl, I really
did think that I would see the edge of the world from the plane,''
the playwright and actress recalls. ``And I remember distinctly
feeling that I was finally at home in the air, being up that high
and having that omniscient view was where, to a certain extent, I'd
always been. I've always been very comfortable in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Several decades after that first celestial odyssey, McLaughlin
is again reaching for new heights.
</P>
<P>
   This week will mark the opening of the Mark Taper Forum's
production of McLaughlin's psychological-adventure drama, ``Tongue
of a Bird,'' about a female search-and-rescue pilot's hunt for an
abducted 12-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   Playing through Feb. 7, it features a heaven-sent cast,
including Tony Award winner Cherry Jones, last seen in Los Angeles
in ``The Heiress,'' as the intrepid aviator, Maxine. The rest of
the all-female ensemble consists of Golden Globe winner Diane
Venora as the child's strong-willed mother, venerable Tony winner
Marian Seldes as Maxine's eccentric Polish grandmother,
Emmy-nominated Sharon Lawrence (``NYPD Blue'') as a spectral
presence and newcomer Ashley Johnson as the missing child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tongue of a Bird'' was commissioned by the Taper and developed
as part of its 1995-96 New Work Festival. It premiered at Seattle's
Intiman Theatre in September 1997 and was subsequently produced at
the Almeida Theatre in London. It will open at the Joseph Papp
Public Theater in New York City in March.
</P>
<P>
   Taper resident director Lisa Peterson, who helmed the Seattle
production, will oversee the play here as well.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin herself already is familiar to Taper audiences as an
actress, having created the eponymous role, so to speak, in
``Angels in America,'' Tony Kushner's two-part epic of AIDS,
Reaganism and premillennial angst. She and Stephen Spinella were
the only actors to be connected with ``Angels'' from its earliest
formative readings in San Francisco all the way through its Tony
Award- and Pulitzer Prize-winning Broadway run.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner is still one of McLaughlin's close friends and, she
says, the only person she trusts to cut her writing. And ``Angels''
remains a high point of her acting career. Imagine getting paid to
dip and soar across Broadway's Walter Kerr Theatre eight times a
week!
</P>
<P>
   ``I just loved it,'' she says. ``It's hard on the back, hard on
the body, but well worth it. I was totally happy up there, 35 feet
above the stage, I was zipping around, I was having the time of my
life. Because it did conform with all those dreams that you have,
you know, those ecstatic dreams of flying.''
</P>
<P>
   Play writing, however, is for McLaughlin an occupation that can
quickly bring you down to earth. Although she has written half a
dozen plays, which have been produced at such prestigious venues as
the Actor's Gang in Los Angeles, the Vineyard Theatre off-Broadway
and at the Humana Festival at the Actors Theatre of Louisville, it
remains for her a process full of storm and stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's your heart and your soul that's like a little raw oyster
out there,'' she says. ``And when the reviews come in, they're
reviewing something essential about you as a human being. As an
actor you've still got a lot of armor because you're saying
somebody else's words, you're in somebody else's production, you've
been directed to do things by a director, you're standing on
somebody else's set. And you're basically in somebody else's
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotional rigors of play writing are magnified if the work
enters deep within the airspace of your own psyche, as it has with
``Tongue of the Bird.'' McLaughlin says she can identify with
certain aspects of Maxine, who has a perfect record of finding
missing persons and always has been able to keep her own demons at
bay by throwing herself into her work.
</P>
<P>
   But, confronted with the increasingly desperate search for the
lost child, Maxine's own unresolved past baggage surfaces with a
vengeance, and a psychological crisis ensues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that, to a certain extent, is what I experienced a few
years ago,'' McLaughlin says, ``that, yeah, I'm good at coping, but
after a certain point you want to do more than cope. You want to
sort of know who you are and confront your demons and get on with
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you get to a certain point in your life where you want to
do more than survive. And actually you want to do more than
succeed. And I think that that's what she (Maxine) gets to, that
she sort of wants to stand in her own body. She wants to land the
plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherry Jones, who has known McLaughlin for many years and,
ironically, inherited the role of the angel from her in ``Angels in
America,'' says she has ``never been so scared of a role'' as she
is of Maxine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally I was not going to do the New York run because I
already knew I'd be doing Los Angeles, and I just didn't think I
could do it (the play) that long, simply because I find it so
disturbing,'' Jones says. ``Even though there is a catharsis at the
end, it literally comes in the 59th minute of the 11th hour, and
the rest of the time it's pretty rough going for Maxine and for all
the other characters. They're in crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   In person, McLaughlin doesn't give the impression of someone
who's ever been on intimate terms with crisis or dire self-doubt.
Calm, steady-eyed and quietly witty, the Yale-educated child of
academic parents appears to always have had both feet planted on
terra firma.
</P>
<P>
   As an ``academic brat,'' she says, she grew up in many different
places, on the campuses of Stanford and Harvard universities and,
later, American University in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up to the sound of typewriters going all night long,
the most comforting sound in the world. And nobody does it anymore!
The clickety-click (of personal computer keyboards), it just isn't
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet her childhood was difficult. Both of McLaughlin's parents
had contracted polio during the epidemic of 1955, before she was
born. Her father began using a wheelchair, and her mother went
temporarily deaf.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother also suffered from severe mental illness for one
10-year period, during which most doctors didn't think she was ever
going to improve, although McLaughlin says her father never doubted
his wife would pull through.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd have these doctors say, `You know, you really should
settle your affairs, your wife's not getting out of here.' And he'd
say, `I think she might. I think she'll be OK.' So it was a tough
childhood. Sort of zero through six for me were pretty bad years.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what kept her grounded during childhood, McLaughlin
hesitates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I was very grounded,'' she replies. ``I had a
psychic once tell me, `You know, you're not actually in your body
almost all the time. You're sort of located behind you'.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin says that ``Tongue of a Bird'' initially shaped up as
a lyrical rumination about women and flying in the form of an epic
poem or perhaps a novel. Its guiding spirit was Amelia Earhart, a
figure who has always interested the playwright, ``but not in a
conventional `she's my hero' way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel like I know her on some level,'' she explains.
``She was really only comfortable in the air. She was a
tremendously uncomfortable being on the ground, socially.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she wasn't a natural. When you realize that she was
actually nauseated every second that she was in the air _ she was
airsick, always, and she was afraid, it wasn't like this was some
easy thing for her _ the desire for that state of being had to be
deeply passionate and compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, McLaughlin ruled out writing a biographical play
about Earheart. Instead, ``Tongue of a Bird'' invokes the vanished
pilot as a kind of icon of self-sufficiency and godlike detachment.
</P>
<P>
   While she's reluctant to generalize about gender, McLaughlin
thinks there may be a fundamental difference in the way men and
women perceive flying _ and in the way male and female aviators
have expressed those feelings in literature. For men, the
experience often is characterized in territorial terms, Man vs.
Nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``And for women, I find that oftentimes it ... has to do with
entering a kind of sublimity, being empowered by an element rather
than conquering an element. It is out-of-body and the confines of
the body, the confines of identity. When you're in the air, you're
not a person who belongs to a country, a family. You're stripped,
to a certain extent, of a kind of human identity. You transcend the
body and the confines of the body. And I think for women that's
different than it is for men.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin describes her talent as a ``cranky'' one, making it
difficult for her to feel comfortable ``writing on demand'' for
film and television, or acting in works she doesn't care for
deeply. She once spent two days working on a soap opera and found
the experience so humiliating and depressing that ``it took me
months to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she describes play writing as ``like watching your baby
walk out into traffic every night,'' she seems dedicated to
fighting her fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing's scary for me,'' she says for more than the second
time. ``I used to be a painter, and I would fall in love with the
blank canvas. And as soon as you put a mark on it, you're marring
it to a certain extent, you're marring the perfection of that blank
canvas.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as soon as you write the beginning of the play, you're
already marring the perfection that exists somewhere inside you.
There is a perfect play, and it will not come out of you whole.'' &QL;

 &HT;    A WORLD WEARY OF MONICAGATE WATCHES THE CLINTON TRIAL,
RELUCTANTLY
 &HT;    With IMPEACH-CLINTON-0114.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES

<P>
   MOSCOW _ On the streets of the Russian capital, souvenir hawkers
peddle a unique version of the matrioshka, the traditional
pear-shaped, wooden nesting doll.
</P>
<P>
   In a twist on the folk craft, this version presents Bill
Clinton's face painted on the outer layer, which opens to reveal a
Monica Lewinsky, then a Ken Starr, then a Hillary Rodham Clinton,
and a Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Lewinsky scandal still inspires hot-selling
novelties, but is it news?
</P>
<P>
   Not big news, judging from many of the major daily newspapers
and broadcasts from Tel Aviv to Tokyo. The world's media is
choosing not to play up the opening arguments Thursday in the first
impeachment trial of an American president in more than 130 years.
</P>
<P>
   After months of saturation coverage of the Clinton saga, the
world seems weary of a bewildering process that blends modern-day
media sensationalism and obscure legal wrangling between the U.S.
House of Representatives, the Senate and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We follow it only because we have a responsibility to do so,''
said Yelena Ovcharenko, foreign editor of ``Komsomolskaya Pravda''
newspaper in Moscow. ``We are tired of this and we would like to
turn the page.''
</P>
<P>
   With widespread predictions that a two-thirds vote is lacking in
the Senate to remove Clinton from office, many wonder just what the
point is of the trial and worry about a lasting effect on American
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Israelis) don't understand how Americans don't realize that
their image is being destroyed in the world,'' said Judith Elizur,
a lecturer in political science at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
``They're worried he won't be effective in Middle East peacemaking
if he is battered by this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if Clinton were to be removed from office, the Mexico
City newspaper ``Reforma'' noted, he would be replaced by Vice
President Al Gore, ``whose political opinions are very similar to
those of his boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, much of the world's press say only America's reputation
and morale are at stake in the current saga, with limited
implications for the globe.
</P>
<P>
   In Central America, Guatemala's ``Prensa Libre'' called the
accusations against Clinton ``serious'' but noted there was little
chance he would be forced from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loser is U.S. society in general because its president has
stained the dignity of his office and hurt moral values across the
country,'' the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   The venerable British Broadcasting Corp. promises live coverage
of portions of the Senate trial. But even the usually avid British
tabloids have taken a break from Monicagate.
</P>
<P>
   In part, this is because the London press has been captivated by
domestic turmoil in Prime Minister Tony Blair's government that has
led to some highly public resignations and finger-pointing. And for
sleaze, the British public got all it wanted from an expose written
by the ex-wife of Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who she accused of
all sorts of infidelities and unacceptable behavior in great
detail.
</P>
<P>
   But sex doesn't sell in Beijing. The Starr Report was banned in
China as obscene. Most accounts of Clinton's troubles in China's
government-controlled newspapers and on television stick to the
least sensational facts that will tell the story. And they usually
spell out that a majority of Americans oppose Clinton's removal
from office.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, newspapers Wednesday carried photos of President
Clinton dancing merrily with Amanda Fernandez, the wife of an
Argentine official at a state dinner for Argentina President Carlos
Menem.
</P>
<P>
   This prompted columnist Bronwen Maddox to admire the president's
toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like him or not,'' Maddox wrote in the London Times. ``You
have to admit that President Clinton is amazing. Judged on
resilience, he beats all other politicians in the United States
hands down.''
</P>
<P>
   In many parts of the world, political scandals involve murder
and brutality. Thus, many people don't quite understand what all
the fuss is about over mere sex.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, editorials centered on the start of peace talks
designed to end a long-time civil war in that country.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican papers played up Pope John Paul II's upcoming visit to
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is coping with deep economic problems -- highlighted by
Wednesday's resignation of the head of the central bank and
devaluation of the real -- which dominates the country's news
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Its ``O Globo'' newspaper wrote recently about Clinton --
Hillary Clinton -- in a piece discussing her possible bid for a
U.S. Senate seat and Republican Elizabeth Dole's potential pursuit
of the presidency in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Interest from the world media will most likely increase should
witnesses appear in the Senate trial or new revelations surface.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, said Yuri Levada, director of the Russian Center for
Public Opinion and Market Research, ``We have our own important
problems to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   If the world's consumers of news have had their fill of Bill
Clinton and former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, apparently
chocolate-lovers have not.
</P>
<P>
   In Ukraine, a candy manufacturer has been deluged with orders
for its new line of ``Monica'' chocolates, a triangular-shaped
confection with raisins and nuts. The box features a cartoon
illustration of Lewinsky addressing the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The candymaker experienced an ``avalanche'' of orders it could
not meet, according to an article in the Russian newspaper
``Sevodnya.''
</P>
<P>
   Its promotional pitch: ``Monica is now available to all.''
</P>

JACKSON CAN BE SEEN AND HEARD AT THE MUSEUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Michael Jackson, who recently returned to the
airwaves at talk radio KRLA-AM (1110), is broadcasting through the
end of next month from the Museum of Television &AMP; Radio in Beverly
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   And you're invited to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's news-talk program is originating from the museum's
glass-enclosed high-tech studio; listeners can drop by anytime
between 9 a.m. and noon weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   Comic George Carlin, a recent visitor to Jackson's show, took a
look around and joked that the veteran broadcaster must be feeling
a bit like a museum piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day, Larry King was walking by the museum and we
happened to see him and invited him in,'' Jackson said Tuesday. ``I
want to make this the radio station of record for L.A. and I can't
think of a more seductive setting. This gives me the opportunity to
meet groups of students _ I've had fourth-, eighth- and
10th-graders in. And by far the best were the fourth-graders, every
single one of whom knew what they wanted to be when they grew up.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who spent three decades at talk outlet KABC-AM (790),
said he also expected to use the museum's auditorium at some point
for a Town Hall broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Television &AMP; Radio is at 465 N. Beverly Drive,
Beverly Hills. Information: (310) 786-1000.
</P>
<P>
   HERE AND THERE: Radio vet Johnny Magnus will host afternoons on
adult standards KLAC-AM (570), starting Jan. 25. Magnus previously
worked at KMPC-AM, KIQQ-FM, KJOI-AM and most recently spearheaded
the ``Music of Your Life'' format for syndication. ... KLOS-FM
(95.5) music director Rita Wilde has been named program director at
the ABC-owned rock station. As a result of the promotion, she has
given up her midday air shift. &QL;

felt sorry for him, and now, as soon as he hears my coffee grinder,
he starts howling. By Anne Raver.

BANKAMERICA CHIEF VOWS MORE LENDING IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The chairman of BankAmerica Corp. is pledging at
least $70 billion over the next 10 years for loans to low- or
moderate-income communities and to minorities in California, saying
that the figure is ``a floor, not a ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   During a trip designed to smooth concerns about the recent
takeover of the San Francisco bank by NationsBank of Charlotte,
N.C., the executive also pledged $20 million in philanthropic gifts
in the state this year, a 30 percent increase over 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh McColl, the chairman and chief executive of the merged
corporation, said Tuesday that decisions about Bank of America
operations in California would be made there, not in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attempting to run an organization this large by concentrating
all authority in one place is a recipe for disaster,'' McColl told
the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks responded to California critics that managers in
Charlotte do not understand the needs of California. Critics,
including some leading public officials, also have said the new
bank is not as responsive to cultural and ethnic diversity as the
former BankAmerica was.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most difficult view I have run into has been the suspicion
from day one that we are going to do the wrong thing instead of the
right thing,'' McColl said in a question-and-answer session. ``And
the view that nothing we have done before counts.''
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank acquired the venerable San Francisco bank last year
but took the Bank of America name. The combined corporation is now
based in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the BankAmerica president for Northern California,
Barbara Desoer, presented one of the banks' first gifts of the
year: $5 million, over five years, to the University of California
at San Francisco for development of a new campus.
</P>
<P>
   The grant is equal to the largest donation ever made by Bank of
America, a $5 million gift in 1997 to support construction of the
Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   John Gamboa, executive director of the San Francisco-based
Greenlining Institute, a nonprofit advocacy center for low-income
and minority groups, said that his and other community
organizations ``would like more investments and fewer presents''
offered by the bank.
</P>
<P>
   He has unsuccessfully pressed McColl to be specific about how
much is available for community lending in California and said
``promises do not ring true.''
</P>
<P>
   McColl said diversity was at the core of the bank's strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have said many times that our company is an inclusive
meritocracy ... It means we care about results, we believe in the
power of diversity and we help all associates fulfill their
potential without regard to race, gender, sexual orientation,
culture, religion or any other non-relevant factor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McColl met with three San Francisco supervisors who have been
critical about the lack of specificity about community lending
plans. Supervisor Michael Yaki said later he was ``pleasantly
surprised'' by the meeting and that McColl wants to work with
political and community leaders to determine the proper course for
lending.
</P>
<P>
   Yaki, who earlier characterized the bank merger as akin to ``The
Invasion of the Body Snatchers,'' said he and McColl had agreed
``the past is past.''

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Something to impeach over
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you think the Monica Lewinsky matter merits impeachment, take
a look at the increasingly dippy UNSCOM spy scandal as something
more like a real reason to throw a president out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say it's true the CIA planted a bug on U.N. weapons
inspectors in Iraq. Let's say the CIA ran the plan past Bill
Clinton beforehand. Let's also imagine the CIA didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Playing fast and loose with UNSCOM, in effect ending inspections
and allowing Saddam Hussein to continue to cook bio-chemicals, is
closer to the kind of abuse the framers had in mind when they made
high crimes and misdemeanors the standard for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Did Bill Clinton know? I have no earthly idea. Was he kept in
the dark? Ditto. Nobody's asking. One can only presume U.N.
inspectors have no sex life worth worrying about.

 &HT;    NEW GUIDELINES OFFERED FOR DISABLED ALCOHOLICS AND ADDICTS
 &HT;    600&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A national panel of experts Wednesday released a
set of guidelines designed to help disabled substance abusers
achieve recoveries like those of John de Miranda and Hector del
Valle.
</P>
<P>
   De Miranda had a seizure disorder and drank excessively. He saw
no connection between them at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I resolved the alcohol problem, the seizure problem
was resolved as well,'' de Miranda said. ``I have been seizure-free
for 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Valle, now 34, was 17 and drunk when he crashed his car into
two other cars and a brick wall, leaving himself paralyzed from the
chest down.
</P>
<P>
   After a grueling therapy session, he and other patients would
party to ``reward'' themselves with alcohol and drugs. He heard
visitors and medical personnel whisper things like, ``If I was in
their situation, I would do it too.''
</P>
<P>
   Today he thinks, ``Perhaps that is why it was so easy to have
family, friends, nurses and home health aides hold my straw to
snort a line of cocaine again, or roll my joints _ because they
only saw what I had lost.''
</P>
<P>
   After nine months of treatment and physical rehabilitation, he
landed a job in New Jersey with the National Council on Alcoholism,
using an expensively equipped van to drive himself and his
wheelchair to public appearances at which he warned against the
consequences of drunk driving.
</P>
<P>
   His brochure read, ``Drinking and Driving can Kill or Worse!''
It had a big picture of del Valle ``as if to say living in a
wheelchair is worse than death,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove drunk or stoned for seven years after the initial
crash,'' del Valle recalled. With the encouragement of recovering
addicts and alcoholics in Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics
Anonymous, he spent the last three of those seven years trying
again and again to quit.
</P>
<P>
   He was turned down twice for in-patient treatment because the
programs lacked features such as assistance with using a toilet or
getting dressed. He missed some meetings in 10-step programs
because they were held in church attics or basements that could be
reached only by narrow stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was he above using his disability to excuse his relapses.
``I thought that I couldn't recover because I was a disabled
individual, and was separate from people who were recovering
without a disability,'' del Valle said.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually he learned to deal with his disability and
substance abuse at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to grieve my disability as I had to grieve my
addiction,'' he said. ``I have to wake up every morning as an
addict and as a quadriplegic. But on Aug. 23, 1989, I came back,
and by the grace of my higher power I have not used a drug or drink
since.''
</P>
<P>
   He strongly endorsed ``Treatment Improvement Protocol 29,'' the
guidelines released Wednesday by the Center for Substance Abuse
Treatment, which is part of the federal Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).
</P>
<P>
   The 156-page reference book spells out ways to cope with this
frustrating tangle of symptoms. It was developed over four years by
a panel of researchers, clinicians, substance abuse program
directors and patient advocates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to distribution through professional and disability
associations, it can be ordered by phone at two toll-free numbers
(1-800-729-6686, or TDD for the hearing-impaired at 1-800-487-4489)
and is to be posted for online access
(http://www.samhsa.gov/csat/csat.html).
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people with disabilities use substance in response to an
injury. Others may suffer injury as a result of using alcohol and
drugs,'' said Dr. H. Westley Clark, the center's director.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is data (indicating) that between 20 and 40 percent of
individuals in treatment for substance use disorders have a
coexisting disability, whether physical, cognitive or affective,''
Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   But many disabled substance abusers aren't being treated, said
Dennis Moore, who chaired the panel. Among the deaf, for example,
one researcher tallied seven hand signs for crack cocaine. ``Yet
there was no sign for abstinence,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, ``five million people with disabilities are
in need of chemical dependency treatment,'' said Moore. He
estimated that men and women with disabilities are about twice as
likely as others to abuse alcohol or drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The protocols tell professionals treating the disabled or
substance abusers about field-tested ways to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Eliminate barriers in attitudes, communications and
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   _ Identify and end discriminatory policies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Train staff to understand and accommodate special needs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Judge whether specialized treatment or use of existing
programs would be better for an individual.
</P>
<P>
   A shorter, simpler version for non-professionals will also be
developed, SAMHSA administrator Nelba (CQ) Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disabilities too often contribute to isolation, chronic pain,
low self-esteem and poverty,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But an appropriate treatment plan can not only help someone
recover, but can help them obtain full-time, part-time or volunteer
work. This opens the door for people who have been stigmatized or
shut out of mainstream life,'' Chavez said.

the disease by 80 to 90 percent. The new study, by researchers at
the Mayo Clinic, is regarded as the most reliable work to date on
the surgery, known as bilateral prophylactic mastectomy. The
authors of the paper, however, cautioned that the findings should
not be used to pressure women into having their breasts removed. By

   FOLK-ART (Undated) _ Among the sleek seals swimming through
Christie's New York with their fur coats, thin watches, Italian
loafers and winter tans, appeared John Gordon, wrapped in a wool
scarf, wearing suede bucks and an imitation beaver-skin coat _ like
a piece of folk Americana miscatalogued in a European sale. Gordon,
72, a preeminent folk Americana dealer who retired eight years ago,
was at the auction house to observe the installation of the 1,352
lots of his own collection, an important view of an unusual field,
being offered Friday and on Tuesday. By William L. Hamilton.

   GRAVES-DESIGNS (Undated) _ At last, there is reason to hope that
the Whitney Museum of American Art may be casting off its
reputation for trendiness. In what may be seen, fairly or not, as a
defining moment in the early tenure of the Whitney's new director,
Maxwell Anderson, the museum has rented its premises next Tuesday
evening for the unveiling of a new line of houseware accessories
and furniture designed by the noted American architect Michael
Graves. By Herbert Muschamp.

<P>
   HAMPTON-ANTIQUES (New York) _ Like extremely rare gilt side
chairs and exceptional Louis XV what's-its, the late decorator Mark
Hampton was a fixture at the Winter Antiques Show. Hampton, who
died at 58 of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma last July, was known for his
erudition as well as an A-list of clients that included George and
Barbara Bush, Anne Bass, Carter and Susan Burden and Pamela
Harriman. He left behind his wife, Duane, two daughters, Alexa, 30,
and Kate, 27, and hundreds of watercolors. By Patricia Leigh-Brown.

   COKE-BOOKS (Undated) _ ``Have you seen them?'' asked Carole
Baron, the president and publisher of Dell Publishing and Delacorte
Press. ``They're cute.'' Indeed they are. Cute was exactly the word
that came to mind when I first set eyes on the six little books
that will, beginning in February, be distributed on supermarket
shelves, tucked inside some 40 million 12- and 24-packs of Diet
Coke. Four inches by six inches, roughly 30 pages thick, these
excerpts of forthcoming works by best-selling authors are adorable.
By Karrie Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   LIVINGROOM-POOL (Undated) _ Andrea Urban was in the kitchen
washing dishes when she heard something strange: ``Suddenly there
was this sound of splashing in the living room,'' she said, ``and I
thought, `Somebody's floating through the house.''' Then it
clicked. It was just her husband, Glen. He had shoved off on his
inaugural swim in the lap pool. By Joseph Giovannini.
</P>
<P>
   DOG-FRIEND (Undated) _ Hemingway is not my dog. He belongs to
the people I rent from, but they don't have the time to exercise
him. He's beautiful, all white with big black liquid eyes and a big
black nose. But he's a work dog; he needs a farm to run on, a herd
of sheep to tend. I started to walk him every morning because I
felt sorry for him, and now, as soon as he hears my coffee grinder,
he starts howling. By Anne Raver.
</P>

STUDENTS SEEKING A `FLAKY' FUTURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Rocky Mountain News)  
 
By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When you're 20 years old, retirement seems like a long
way off. Joining the snowbirds in South Texas or being able to golf
every day isn't a big conversation starter on campus.
</P>
<P>
   But at an age when students are likely to be telling tales of
drinking vast quantities of beer, many of them are thinking ahead
to an early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-one percent of college students reported that they plan to
retire between 40 and 50 years of age in a online poll by the
accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick. Another 17 percent plan to
retire between the ages of 50 and 60.
</P>
<P>
   Career counselors weren't a bit surprised to hear that.
</P>
<P>
   Many college students and recent college graduates want to stop
their traditional career early in life and devote their time to a
hobby, focus on volunteer work or start their own business.
</P>
<P>
   Students are thinking of their life as a series of careers,
rather than a climb up one career ladder until retirement, said
Cheryl Matherly, director of career services at Rice University in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   One student told her she wanted to go to medical school and work
as a physician until the age of 40. After that, she'd like to join
a group of doctors doing relief work in Guatemala until the age of
60 and finally buy some land and open an antique store.
</P>
<P>
   Many others plan to teach after ``retirement'' or start their
own businesses, said Matherly, who teaches a career and life
options course for freshmen and sophomores. When these students
talk about retirement, it's not the traditional put up your feet
and watch television all day.
</P>
<P>
   Matherly was also struck by how important money is to the
students she talks to. They recognize that they can't satisfy their
other needs _ such as volunteering full-time _ until they have
enough money to support that career change.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Holdcroft, vice president of Career Management Resources in
Dallas, a company that sets up in-house career development programs
for corporations, said she also has found that recent graduates
increasingly are interested in making financial plans to ensure
they'll have the money they need to retire early.
</P>
<P>
   That's a change. Young people didn't usually focus on financial
planning for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
INTERESTING WORK SOUGHT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While students want to earn enough to retire sooner than their
parents, they're also keen to find interesting work, Matherly said.
They don't just want to find a high-paying job that isn't
satisfying until they can earn enough to quit and do what really
interests them.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Laird Jr., a senior at Texas A&AMP;M University in College
Station, Texas, has a clear career plan: He's studying civil
engineering and plans to get a job with a company that will let him
learn everything he can about construction. By the time he's in his
30s, Laird said, he wants to start his own construction company.
</P>
<P>
   Those first years will be tough, so the 21-year-old student
figures he won't be able to retire really early. Laird figures that
retiring at the age of 60 is more like it.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Milano, partner in charge of university relations for
KPMG Peat Marwick in Montvale, N.J., said that retirement age is
more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Milano, a certified public accountant who admitted he likes to
see mountains of data before he will proclaim a trend, speculated
that students who are planning to retire in their 40s are doing
little more than wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   What would you say if you're asked if you want to work until
you're 70 years of age or quit when you're 50 and do something
really neat and cool like joining an over-50 football league?
Milano asked.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LAYOFFS MAKE IMPRESSION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Career counselors believe, however, that the tide is turning.
Every student today has seen someone close to them get downsized _
either a parent, relative or family friend _ and they have been
deeply affected by that devastating experience, said Holdcroft.
That's convinced students they can't just rely on an employer to
provide them with a lifetime career.
</P>
<P>
   That thinking leads students to consider a much wider variety of
options, including early retirement. It also has removed the stigma
that someone who quits a traditional 9 to 5 job somehow shows a
weak work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   Our fathers couldn't retire early from a traditional job for
fear of being labeled flaky, said Matherly, but younger workers
don't have that same constraint. Now, it's cool to think about
retiring early and doing something completely different.
</P>
<P>
   That said, they'd still like to know, ``Where's the beer?''
</P>

WHOOSH! THE NEXT PENTIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Nick built his own personal computer from scratch in 1996,
it was the fastest machine in our house. He spent his life savings
for components, including a motherboard that contained an Intel
Pentium 166 microprocessor. He was 13 years old then. Now he is 16
and in high school, with the keys to my car, and he cannot believe
he ever thought a Pentium 166 was cool.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was cool, for about three months, until it was
upstaged first by faster versions of the Pentium chip, then by the
Pentium with MMX and then by the Pentium II, all of which came in
steadily ascending chip speeds. Today, Nick regards his ancient
computer as decidedly lame, but marginally useful and occasionally
amusing _ sort of like his parents.
</P>
<P>
   The only difference, from his perspective, anyway, is that
parents start out old and get older, while computers start fresh
and new, only to descend into decrepitude at an abnormally
accelerated pace.
</P>
<P>
   And now it is happening again. The Intel Corp. is about to
introduce the Pentium III, a new generation of microprocessor for
consumer and business computers. Or, as Intel's marketing folks
call it, the Pentium !!!, with exclamation points replacing the
Roman numerals of the old Pentium II chip.
</P>
<P>
   Or are they three daggers? They must look that way to anyone who
bought a new Pentium II computer just in time for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the chip ought to be called the Pentium ??? because
Intel will not divulge its performance specifications until later,
probably during Super Bowl commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Computer makers already have the Pentium III systems ready to be
shipped. They are waiting until Intel's marketing army is ready to
try to convince us, once again, that it is time to upgrade our PCs
and downgrade our bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, most PC owners question whether they are suckers
for buying into this constant game of rapid obsolescence. The
advance of computer technology has always occurred at a dizzying
speed, but the experience of computing seems to slog along at the
same old pace.
</P>
<P>
   We have been promised for years that as computers get more
powerful, they will become easier to use and more useful, allowing
us to do wonderful new things.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, however, the most wonderful advances in recent
years have been the growth of the Internet and its main
applications, including the World Wide Web, E-mail and E-commerce.
When it comes to the Internet, a faster modem has probably had more
impact on our happiness than a faster processor.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some analysts are now suggesting that we are on the
cusp of a new, ``post PC'' era in which simple, relatively
inexpensive information appliances, not complex PCs with
fire-breathing microprocessors, will win the hearts of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   With the Pentium III, however, Intel is once again promising
that great things are just around the corner, including better
tools for using the Internet, and that people who do not adopt the
newest chip will miss out on exciting new computing experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we've heard it all before. But there are technical and
economic reasons to be interested in the imminent arrival of the
Pentium IIIs, even if one has no plans to move up to the new chip.
</P>
<P>
   On the technical side, there are two principal things that
differentiate the Pentium III from the Pentium II. One is speed.
Intel is expected to offer two versions of the new chip at first,
one operating at 450 megahertz and one at the milestone level of
500 MHz.
</P>
<P>
   A version that is 600 MHz or faster is expected by the end of
the year. Chip speed alone is not a reliable measure of computer
performance, but all other things being equal, standard software
applications will run faster on a 500-MHz machine than on a 400-MHz
system.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The second and more intriguing difference is something called
the Katmai New Instructions, a set of some 70 new multimedia
instructions that programmers can use to create applications with
better audio and graphics. Katmai was the code name for the Pentium
III.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Intel added new instructions for its major PC
microprocessor line was two years ago, when it introduced the
Pentium MMX chip. MMX stands for multimedia extensions, and
software developers eventually took advantage of the new hooks to
develop software with better graphics and sound.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's rivals, including Advanced Micro Devices, Cyrix and IDT,
came up with their own version, called 3DNow, which greatly
improves the performance of 3-D graphics and has been very popular
with game designers.
</P>
<P>
   According to people who have worked with it, the Pentium III
chip with Katmai New Instructions pushes ahead of both MMX and
3DNow. Intel has been working with software developers for more
than a year in preparation for the Katmai introduction, so
announcements are likely to come from software makers about their
support for the new chip in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, consumers can expect new software that makes
richer use of video, sound, speech and 3-D graphics. Games will get
more realistic, with almost fluid motion, better video playback,
better sound quality and superior 3-D graphics.
</P>
<P>
   But there will also be improvements in streaming video and audio
over the Internet, speech recognition as a user interface, video
E-mail, DVD-based entertainment, video and sound editing, and other
multimedia applications that developers are keeping secret for now.
</P>
<P>
   Such enticements typically make people reach for their wallets.
Some do so warily because they know that to take full advantage of
a Pentium III machine, they will have to buy new software. Others
do so enthusiastically because they want to be the first one on the
block to have the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Intel will probably reserve the Katmai instruction set
exclusively for its Pentium III chips for the next year, at least,
before extending it to the rest of the Intel product line. Doing so
will create a clear difference between the high end Pentium III and
the low end Celeron chips.
</P>
<P>
   With the introduction last week of 366-MHz and 400-MHz versions
of the Celeron, the performance gap between the cheaper Celersons
and the Pentium IIs is quite narrow.
</P>
<P>
   Intel officials would not disclose the pricing for its Pentium
III chips, and they are prohibiting PC makers from talking about
system prices before the Pentium III is formally launched, which
might not occur until late February. But analysts say Intel plans
to be aggressive in keeping Pentium III prices low because of
increasing pressure from companies like AMD.
</P>
<P>
   AMD, meanwhile, is preparing to announce in a few weeks its K6-3
Sharptooth microprocessor, which it will promote as a challenger to
the Pentium III. And later this year, AMD is scheduled to unveil
the K-7, a powerful and fast chip that AMD asserts will finally let
the company break free from its usual place a speed bump or two
behind Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Details of all these future chips are unknown, but one thing is
certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be a price war,'' said Keith Diefendorff,
editor in chief of The Microprocessor Report, a newsletter
published in Sunnyvale, Calif. ``Intel's latest announcements have
some pretty impressive prices on the low end, much lower than what
they have done before. They are growing tired of AMD taking market
share and they are going to put up a fight. That's going to cause
AMD to cut their prices. It's great news for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   People who just want to do word processing, E-mail and basic
Internet browsing will almost certainly be able to buy a very
capable low-end machine, with more power for less money. The cost
of Pentium II-based machines will come down as the chip is phased
out.
</P>
<P>
   Cautious PC owners can relax and wait to see whether the new
applications written specifically for the Pentium III are really
worth the cost of upgrading. And fanatic game players, who
perpetually lust after the fastest machine on the block, will soon
have a choice of several new high-end machines.
</P>
<P>
   The hard part for Nick will be deciding whether to spend his
momney on petroleum or silicon.

<P>
   Maud Lavin and Locke Bowman were each other's first loves,
college sweethearts who were together for three intense years then
went their separate ways. One day, twenty-two years and three
marriages later _ one for her, two for him _ Bowman was in New York
on business. He called Ms. Lavin and they met for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   As they made tentative steps back into each other's orbit,
e-mail flew back and forth constantly between his computer in
Chicago and hers in New York. Their messages _ some 200 in all _
were at once confessional and guarded, brutally honest and gently
solicitous. Three-and-a-half months after the first message, they
were married.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a story about anonymous passion, infused with
subtext that asks, ``What does he/she look like?'' and ``Will the
physical chemistry be there?'' It's not the real life version of
the movie ``You've Got Mail.'' This is about the role e-mail can
play in matters of the heart when you already know about that
strange thing your former, current, or prospective lover does with
his mouth, or that sometimes annoying way she flips her hair back
when she's nervous. It is about the revival of the epistolary
romance.
</P>
<P>
   Love by letter is nothing new, of course. During the Victorian
Era, when the post was delivered several times each day,
impassioned letters fairly flew from door to door. Even before
those days, no Jane Austen novel would have been complete without
repeated scenes at the writing desk. When the telephone became a
more convenient instrument of communication, the intensity of
conducting a love affair by letter tapered off.
</P>
<P>
   Now e-mail has returned to relationships the ability to
formulate feelings and desires by writing them down.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, e-mail represents an inverted version of the
role of the letter in courtship rites, said Steven Johnson,
co-founder of the online magazine Feed and author of ``Interface
Culture: How New Technology Transforms the Way We Create and
Communicate,'' (HarperCollins 1997) ``Letters gave you the
formality of actually putting it down on paper,'' he said. ``You
could express in full rich language the depth of your feelings.
E-mail prose is much more informal. It's half way between speech
and writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lavin and Bowman, both 44, had already known each other
intimately.
</P>
<P>
   But when they rediscovered each other, divorce had made them
wary and frightened. Ms. Lavin credits e-mail with helping them
broach topics too awkward for the telephone, yet too urgent for
snail mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about everything,'' she said. ``It was like one long
pajama party.'' A running electronic dialogue, she said, also
helped speed things up. ``I think we would have gotten together
anyway, but it would have taken much more time.'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations with a few couples among the many who have courted
_ or parted _ by e-mail suggest that people with an affinity for
words are those most likely to embrace the technology as a means of
propelling a relationship forward, or speeding its end.
</P>
<P>
   Alaina and David Sloo met at a computer industry press
conference in New York in 1993. Ms. Sloo, then an analyst in New
York, caught the eye of Sloo, then a user interface designer at a
Silicon Valley startup. They went out for coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought anyone who could describe the tables at the Royalton
as looking like turtles tucking themselves up under their shells
was a guy worth knowing,'' recalled Ms. Sloo. ``But it wasn't until
I got an e-mail message from him that I realized he had an
astonishing imagination and routinely turned the most mundane
things into pure fun with the turn of a phrase. And I promptly fell
in love.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a year, they lived on separate coasts, then Ms. Sloo
moved to California and they married in 1995. ``I think writing
makes a fun-loving, poetic soul visible much faster than speech,''
said Ms. Sloo.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sloo, 33, said she believed there can be lingering effects
when a relationship has been galvanized by e-mail. ``Sometimes I
wonder if one of the reasons we're so given to turning our grocery
list into a Gershwin rhyme or falling into fits of alliteration on
the sidewalk is that we built our relationship on the written word,
rather than the spoken word,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   M.P. Dunleavey, 33, a writer in New York, and her boyfriend,
Paul Budnitz, 31, an entrepreneur in Berkeley, Calif. had an
experience similar to that of the Sloos. After meeting at a party
in New York last February, they went on a date. Things went well.
Soon after, he left for a three-week trip to Hawaii. E-mail became
not just a means of frequent communication, but, for Ms. Dunleavey,
it was also a gauge of the seriousness of his intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely paid close attention to how he was e-mailing me,
how long his e-mails were, how often he sent them, how quickly he
responded to mine, etcetera,'' she said. ``You're trying to see how
interested this person is.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the spring and summer and into fall, although they were
visiting each other frequently, the e-mail flow remained constant.
``Sometimes it was just these cute little dumb remarks,'' said Ms.
Dunleavey. ``It was almost a way of reaching out and tousling
someone on the head. Once he sent me an e-mail that was my name,
Mary Pat, copied a hundred times. Then `I love you.'And that was
it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But e-mail is no substitute for the real thing. Last week, Ms.
Dunleavey moved to California to be together with Budnitz. And now
that they are married, Ms. Lavin and Bowman seldom use e-mail to
communicate with each other. ``During the day we use the phone,''
said Ms. Lavin.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail is as much of a boon for cowards and cads as it is for
separated lovers. Polly Shulman, 35, a senior editor at Discover
Magazine in New York, noted the appeal of e-mail as something to
hide behind. When her boyfriend of a year confessed to her that he
had been having a clandestine romance _ with someone, it may bear
noting, that he had met electronically _ he preferred to conduct
the painful prelude to his breakup with Ms. Shulman over e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was ridiculous, because we lived seven blocks
apart. I thought: Why can't we do this in person?'' said Ms.
Shulman. ``He's a writer and feels like he has more access to who
he really is in writing, that he's revealing a truer aspect of
himself than by talking person to person.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks after the final split, Ms. Shulman received a box
from her former beau containing her possessions _ including someone
else's undergarment, which Ms. Shulman noticed was nothing close to
her size. She donated the lingerie to Goodwill, and fictionalized
the experience in a short story she published in the Village Voice.
She has not identified her former lover.
</P>
<P>
   Currently in a relationship with a colleague, Ms. Shulman avoids
e-mail, preferring instead to ``just stick my head over the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kaminer, 32, president of a public relations firm in New
York, has broken up via e-mail, and says he regrets it. After
months of a long-distance relationship with someone in London, he
recalls, he wanted to put an end to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put together a very terse e-mail and sent it over to him. It
said something like, `This is it. Bye-bye,' '' he said. ``It was
direct enough, and impersonal, and enough of a brushoff he wouldn't
get in touch with me again.''
</P>
<P>
   Or so Kaminer thought. Instead, the plan backfired. For months
afterward, he recounted, ``I'd get phone calls from him, drunk. The
e-mail brush-off seemed to set him off more than anything I could
have said on the phone. It set some bomb off in this guy's head.''
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, said Kaminer, ``It was obviously a total cop-out.
I wouldn't do it again unless I really really disliked the
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Ullman, author of ``Close to the Machine: Technophilia and
Its Discontents'' (City Lights 1997), is also a critic of the
technique. ``Breaking up is a dreadful thing to do by e-mail,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Ms. Ullman confessed to having done precisely that.
``Several times. With the same person,'' she added. ``There was no
other way to get in touch. The only alternative was a cell phone,
and he had said he was too busy to talk with me. What was I
supposed to do? Break up a meeting? So e-mail seemed the best
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said, e-mail is a medium famous for being sent in the
heat of the moment and she advised caution. ``I have a folder that
I call `letters for the drawer,' '' she said. ``I get it off my
chest but don't send it.'' Ms. Ullman's system isn't perfect.
``Sometimes I take it right out of `letters for the drawer' and
send it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail can also be a good way to clarify things at the start of
a brand new relationship, especially for someone as reserved as Jon
Coifman. After Coifman, 32, a senior program director at
Environmental Media Services in Washington, D.C., went out with
Lisa Magnino, 31, a public relations executive, he was unclear
where things stood. ``I wasn't sure if the first date had actually
been a date or something else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So the following morning, he sent an e-mail asking just that.
Ms. Magnino e-mailed back cheerily that a date it had been. But
whatever reassurance Coifman may have taken from that message (and
a sign, perhaps, that e-mail, alone, will never a successful
relationship make) paled when he picked up Ms. Magnino for a second
date the next week. ``She planted a big one on me as soon as she
opened the door,'' he recounted.
</P>
<P>
   Now Coifman and Ms. Magnino live together and work in the same
office building. They still use e-mail, but differently. ``Now we
fire crude little missives back and forth,'' he said. &QL;

 &HT;    Editors: RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT
 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes.)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or E-mail
him at q&AMP;(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt is back in the
news, can you refresh my memory: When and where was he shot, and
was the person who shot him ever caught?
</P>
<P>
   A: Flynt was shot by a sniper on March 6, 1978, near the
Gwinnett County Courthouse in Lawrenceville, Ga. Gene Reeves, an
attorney who helped defend Flynt against charges that he broke
Georgia's obscenity laws in Gwinnett County, also was wounded. On
the day of the shooting, Flynt and Reeves had eaten at a cafeteria
and as they walked back to court, they were struck by the sniper's
bullets. One pierced Flynt's spine and another cut through his
back, continuing through Reeves' arm and into his abdomen. The
trial was called off and the charges dropped. Flynt was left
paralyzed, but Reeves recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Joseph Paul Franklin, a self-proclaimed white
supremacist, confessed while in an Illinois jail for murder to the
Flynt shooting and other shootings, including the wounding of civil
rights leader Vernon Jordan. Franklin said he shot Flynt because
the pornographer published sexually explicit pictures of an
interracial couple. Franklin was indicted in 1983 in Flynt's
shooting, but Gwinnett prosecutors never brought him to trial
because he already was facing stiffer penalties in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Q: During the NBA strike negotiations, I heard frequent
references to the ``Larry Bird rule'' or the ``Larry Bird
exception.'' What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: That was the rule allowing a team to go over its salary cap
to sign one of its own players who became a free agent. It was so
named because Larry Bird with the Boston Celtics was one of the
first situations it came into play.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was said on a TV quiz show that there are eight time zones
in the United States, but we can count only seven. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are only six time zones in the United States. From the
east: Eastern, Central, Mountain, Pacific, Alaska and
Hawaii-Aleutian. Three other North American times zones (heading
east) are: Atlantic, Newfoundland and Greenland. But Newfoundland
might not be considered a true time zone because it differs from
its neighboring time zones by only a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who was the first secretary-general of the United Nations?
How many have there been since then, and will you list their names
and nationalities?
</P>
<P>
   A: Seven men have served as secretary-general: Trygve Lie of
Norway, 1946-53; Dag Hammarskjold of Sweden, 1953-61; U Thant of
Burma, 1961-71; Kurt Waldheim of Austria, 1972-81; Javier Perez de
Cuellar of Peru, 1982-91; Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt, 1992-96;
and, since Jan. 1, 1997, Kofi Annan of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Four men, educated and world travelers,were discussing the
origin of the expression ``a lion's share'' the other day, and each
had a different explanation. Can you clarify how it came about?
</P>
<P>
   A: A lion's share is the largest portion of anything, and
relates to the term ``leonine contract,'' which means a completely
one-sided agreement. According to the Facts on File Encyclopedia of
Word and Phrase Origins, the source of both is Aesop's fable about
the lion that hunted with several other animals, with the lion
claiming all the spoils of the hunt. One-quarter of the spoils he
claimed as king of beasts; a second quarter because he was braver
than any other animal; a third for his mate and cubs; ``and as for
the fourth, let him who will, dispute it with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the characters on the Taster's Choice TV
commercials? It was sort of a love triangle. Now I don't see them
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   A: The spots fell apart, rather like the complicated
relationships they portrayed. But they kept many viewers enthralled
for a long time. The ad campaign, launched in 1990, had 13
episodes, the last of which was shown in July 1997. It started when
a divorced woman, whose name was never disclosed, knocked on the
door of a neighbor, a single (and suave) gentleman identified as
Michael. She had wanted to borrow some coffee, and he introduced
her to Taster's Choice.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the woman's ex-husband, Andrew, came back into
her life, as did her grown son. Viewers were tantalized about how
it would turn out, but they won't ever know, because the
commercials ended without a climax. In the last one, the ex-husband
arrived to pick up the woman for a date. Michael was clearly
disturbed. The ex-husband was shown calling the next day to
apologize to the woman for creating the awkward scene. ``I'm sorry
about last night,'' he said. She interrupted with a mysterious
``I'm not.'' And that was the end.
</P>
<P>
   In print advertisements in October 1997, Taster's Choice invited
viewers/consumers to decide, through a poll, which man she should
pick. Michael won, but no later commercial ever dramatized the
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If the Atlanta Falcons should go to the Super Bowl in 2000,
when it's scheduled for the Georgia Dome, would the game site have
to be moved to another city?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. So it would be considered a ``home game,'' even though
most people in the Dome would be corporate execs and others from
all over.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recall that years ago, when I was in school, stamps cost 3
cents, and they stayed at that price for the longest time. Do you
know exactly how long?
</P>
<P>
   A: The per-ounce rate was 2 cents on July 1, 1885, said Barry
Ziehl of the U.S. Postal Service. It rose to 3 cents on Nov. 3,
1917, but went back to 2 cents on July 1, 1919. Then on July 6,
1932, it went back up to 3 cents, and didn't rise again (to 4
cents) until Aug. 1, 1958. Ziehl said he couldn't speculate on why
the rate was lowered between 1919 and 1932.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's often mentioned that Republican Rep. J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma is a former college football player. When was that? Did he
also play pro football? How old is he, and does he have a family?
</P>
<P>
   A: Indeed he did play pro ball _ in Canada. From 1981 to 1986,
Watts started for Ottawa and Toronto in the Canadian Football
League. Watts was voted the most valuable player of the Grey Cup
game _ the CFL's equivalent of the Super Bowl _ his rookie season,
said his spokeswoman, Tobi Edwards. Watts had been drafted by the
New York Jets as a running back, but he wanted to play the
quarterback position and went to Canada. Before his entrance into
elective office in 1990 as an Oklahoma State Corp. commissioner,
Watts was best known to many people as the University of Oklahoma
quarterback who led the Sooners to consecutive Big Eight
championships and Orange Bowl victories in 1979 and '80.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. (for Julius Caesar) Watts Jr. was born Nov. 18, 1957, in
Eufaula, Okla., the son of a Baptist minister and policeman who
also traded cattle. The junior Watts graduated from the University
of Oklahoma in 1981 with a B.A. in journalism. He won his seat in
Congress, representing Oklahoma's 4th District, in 1994, and was
re-elected in 1998 with 62 percent of the vote. He and his wife,
Frankie, have five children and live in Norman, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can we use our old 1-cent stamps along with remaining 32-cent
stamps for the new mailing rate, instead of buying the
undenominated supplement stamp that the post office is selling?
Like the new $20 bill, it looks like something somebody printed in
their cellar.
</P>
<P>
   A: You can use any combination of new or old stamps you like, so
long as they add up to 33 cents, said Postal Service spokeswoman
Sandra Harding in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the difference between Coca-Cola Co. and Coca-Cola
Enterprises?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're obviously closely entertwined. As explained in
Hoover's Handbook of American Business 1998, ``Guys in lab coats
and suits at the Coca-Cola Co. concoct the secret recipes and
blitz-market the brand, but Coca-Cola Enterprises does much of the
actual bottling and distribution of Coca-Cola products.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the more official explanation, from CCE's Web site
(http://www.cokecce.com): ``Coca-Cola Enterprises is the world's
largest marketer, producer and distributor of products of the
Coca-Cola Co. We also distribute Dr Pepper and several other
beverage brands in selected territories. We are an independent,
public company traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the
stock symbol CCE.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coca-Cola Co. (stock symbol KO) develops products,
produces the advertising and programs to support those products,
and sells syrup concentrate to Coca-Cola Enterprises and other
bottlers. As a bottler, we combine the product concentrate with
other ingredients to manufacture and package our beverages.
Coca-Cola Enterprises then uses its extensive sales and delivery
force to market and distribute products to retail customers and
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about a plagiarism case involving
authors Danielle Steel and Nora Roberts? What books were involved,
and what was the disposition of the case?
</P>
<P>
   A: Steel wasn't one of the parties. The copyright infringement
lawsuit that shook the world of romance writing down to its
throbbing heart was filed by Roberts in August 1997 against fellow
romance writer Janet Dailey. The suit was settled out of court last
year for an undisclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved two of Dailey's books, ``Aspen Gold'' (1991)
and ``Notorious'' (1996), both of which contained ideas and
passages that she admitted were lifted from works by Roberts.
Dailey said the plagiarism occurred at a time when her husband was
undergoing cancer surgery and she was under great stress. When
asked about the incident last year, Dailey's husband, Bill, told
The Associated Press: ``That's all behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   The plagiarism first came to light when it was posted on the
Internet by readers who cited comparisons between paragraphs in
novels by both writers. Initial reports about the lawsuit said
Roberts was asking Dailey to make a donation to the Literacy
Volunteers of America in lieu of damages, but it wasn't disclosed
if that came to pass in the settlement.

 &HT;    EDITORS: RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT
 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of 2.)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I recall that Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) started publicly calling
for President Clinton's impeachment almost immediately after the
president was elected for the first time. Can you refresh my memory
about the sequence of these events?
</P>
<P>
   A: Clinton was first elected president Nov. 3, 1992. He was
inaugurated Jan. 20, 1993. It was more than four years later _
March 1997 _ when Barr wrote a letter to Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.),
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, asking Hyde to consider
beginning an impeachment inquiry of Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent item in Q&AMP;A said bottled waters have had the
fluoride filtered out. Is the same true for those of us using
faucet filters? I've had a PUR water filter for some time, and when
I bought it, I was told it doesn't filter out fluoride. I want the
fluoride for my children's benefit.
</P>
<P>
   A: You're in good shape using a PUR filter. ``None of our
products take out the fluoride in the water,'' Q&AMP;A was told by Judy
Smith of PUR and Recovery Engineering, which makes the PUR drinking
water system. The PUR filter does claim to remove lead and
chlorine, as well as Crypto (Cryptosporidium) and Giardia bacteria.
For more information about what the filter does and does not
remove, call PUR consumer service at 1-800-787-5463 or
1-800-845-7873.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, while fluoride is removed from most bottled waters,
not all are fluoride-free. Gleda James, president of Lithia Springs
Water Co. in Georgia, says her firm's mineral water contains
natural fluoride in the amount of 1.7 milligrams per liter. Doe
information: 770-944-3880.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that ever since Elizabeth Dole became president of
the American Red Cross, contibutions have been down. Is this true?
Can you list the total annual contributions to the Red Cross from
the time she took over until now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although contributions haven't gone up every year under Dole,
they've shown an increase of $181 million over the eight-year
period, according to the American Red Cross. Dole, who became
president of the Red Cross in February 1991, announced recently
that she would step down, prompting speculation that she would be a
Republican candidate for the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions over Dole's eight-year period added up to $3.4
billion, of which more than $650 million was earmarked for disaster
relief, said Red Cross spokesman Bill Maddox. The year-by-year
amounts: 1991, $386 million; 1992, $394.7 million; 1993, $535.6
million; 1994, $504.7 million; 1995, $465.6 million; 1996, $474.4
million; 1997, $493.4 million; 1998, $566.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross is not a government organization, Maddox
pointed out, so it relies on contributions from the public,
businesses, corporations and foundations. During her tenure, Dole
initiated a complete redesign of the organization's fund-raising
practices and launched a new four-year fund-raising growth plan,
Maddox added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We would like to write to Larry Flynt, who is so much in the
news lately for his project to expose what he calls the hypocrisy
of some members of Congress. What is the address?
</P>
<P>
   A: The publisher of Hustler magazine can be contacted at: L.F.P.
Inc., 8484 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 900, Beverly Hills, CA 90211.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the address for the Council of Conservative Citizens,
the organization that Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) spoke to, igniting a
controversy because of its white supremacist views?
</P>
<P>
   A: Write: Council of Conservative Citizens, P.O. Box 221683, St.
Louis, MO 63122. While Barr admits having spoken to the group, he
disassociated himself from it after his appearance was publicized,
saying he initially wasn't aware of its extremist views. That point
was disputed by his critics, however, who maintain that the group's
reputation is well known.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Five women were just sworn in to statewide office in Arizona,
making it the first state to have an all-female elected line of
succession. What are their party affiliations?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gov. Jane Hull, Secretary of State Betsey Bayless, Treasurer
Caro-- Springer and Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa
Graham Keegan are Republicans; Attorney General Janet Napolitano is
a Democrat. Arizona doesn't have a lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting footnote: According to statistics compiled by the
Center for the American Woman and Politics at Rutgers University,
Arizona long has had one of the highest percentages in the nation
of women in state legislatures. This year's percentage: 36.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I get tickets to Super Bowl XXXIV in Atlanta next
January? How much will they cost?
</P>
<P>
   A: A limited number of tickets is made available to the public
through a lottery. To enter the lottery for the 2000 game, send a
certified letter with your request between March 1 and June 1 to:
Super Bowl Ticket Lottery, National Football League, 280 Park Ave.,
New York, NY 10017. Names will be drawn at random for the
opportunity to purchase tickets. A National Football League
spokesman said he expected ``about 5,000'' to be available next
year. Tickets for the Jan. 31 game in Miami are $325 each; the cost
for Atlanta's Super Bowl hasn't yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Often on ``Good Morning America,'' a group of people is shown
saying something like this: ``We are the teachers from the Atlanta
middle schools. Good morning, America!'' How can we do that?
</P>
<P>
   A: First, you need to be aware that a screening process is
involved, and potential subjects for ``GMA faces,'' as they're
called, are backed up for at least six months. But if you want to
try your luck, you need to contact the network's local affiliate,
said ABC publicist Dahlia Roemer in New York. If the local
affiliate determines by its screening that the proposed group is
suitable, if then forwards it to ``Good Morning America'' at ABC
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I haven't seen who will perform the national anthem at this
year's Super Bowl. Do you know?
</P>
<P>
   A: It will be sung by Cher.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent TV commercial for the Audi A6 showed a European city
square scene with a bride, a man on a bicycle, and a man and woman
embracing. The music, sung in a foreign language, was haunting.
Where was it filmed? Who performed the music, and what is the
language?
</P>
<P>
   A: The spot, part of a six-commercial campaign for Audi titled
``Heart,'' was filmed at the Royal Naval Academy in London, said
Joni Madison, head of broadcast production at the ad agency
McKinney &AMP; Silver in Raleigh. The music is a Bulgarian folk song
performed by Mystere de Voix Bulgares, the Bulgarian State Radio
and Television female choir. The particular number in question is
``Polegnala e Todora,'' a love song. The language, of course, is
Bulgarian.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read several items suggesting that Ted Turner might run
for president. Is that true? I would vote for him because he's got
scads of money, so he couldn't be bought by any special-interest
group, and his wife is no wallflower, so maybe he wouldn't get into
any sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's the official response from Turner Broadcasting
spokeswoman Caroline Harkleroad: ``We can confirm that in November,
The New Yorker magazine reported that Mr. Turner said he would like
to run for president. On several occasions in the past, he also has
talked about running, but he has never announced his candidacy. His
current focus is his work as vice chairman of Time Warner Inc. and
his dedication to the United Nations Foundation, the Turner
Foundation and other philanthropic endeavors.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does ESPN stand for?
</P>
<P>
   A: It doesn't stand for anything any more. But when ESPN started
in 1979, it was the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network
(thus, ESPN). However, the full name was dropped in February 1985
when the company adopted a new corporate name, ESPN Inc., and a new
logo. Based in Bristol, Conn., ESPN is 80 percent owned by ABC
Inc., which is an indirect subsidiary of The Walt Disney Co. The
Hearst Corp. holds the remaining 20 percent interest in ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What powers does a president have to grant pardons? Must
other government leaders be consulted? Can pardons be challenged?
How common are they?
</P>
<P>
   A: The presidential power to pardon is absolute. As it has been
interpreted by the courts, the pardon power is one of the few
constitutional powers of the president that does not require the
agreement of Congress or allow for congressional interference.
</P>
<P>
   A challenge is possible, however. Such was the case when
attorney George Murphy brought an action against President Ford
seeking a judicial declaration that Ford's pardon of ex-President
Nixon was unconstitutional. Chief Judge Noel Fox of the U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Michigan validated the
pardon, but took the unusual step of lambasting Ford's decision.
``Evidence now available suggests a strong probability that the
Nixon administration was conducting a covert assault on American
liberty and an insurrection and rebellion against constitutional
government itself,'' Fox declared.
</P>
<P>
   Pardons are not uncommon. President Washington used his pardon
power to help quell the Whiskey Rebellion, and Presidents
Washington, John Adams, Madison, Lincoln, Andrew Johnson and Carter
all have granted amnesties, the latter extended to Vietnam-era
draft evaders. President Bush issued controversial pardons to
several key figures implicated in the Iran-contra scandal during
the Reagan administration, and Nixon pardoned labor leader Jimmy
Hoffa. President Truman pardoned more than 1,500 people who had
violated the Secret Service Act during World War II, and President
Reagan issued nearly 400 pardons during his two terms.

PLAYFUL ALCHEMY: A MOVIE BECOMES A GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If, as Frank Zappa observed, writing about music is like dancing
about architecture, then video games about movies are like
synchronized swimming about opera. The media have very little in
common except a flat screen.
</P>
<P>
   And the question is: How do you map a linear, noninteractive
story onto a free-ranging environment where the player decides what
comes next? How do you translate a film into a game without
compromising either?
</P>
<P>
   For Disney Interactive, which produced a version of ``A Bug's
Life'' for the Sony Playstation, it was a particularly tricky
prospect because the intended audience _ children 8 to 12 years old
_ has sky-high standards for video games. Having seen the movie,
they already know the story.
</P>
<P>
   A few months from now, they will have seen it over and over on
video. They don't want anything incongruous in a game, but they
demand something new. And they expect it to look great.
</P>
<P>
   Grafting the film's narrative into the structure of a game is an
exercise in streamlining. ``We went through the film very early
with the script and picked out what we thought were high points, or
beat points,'' said Dan Winters, the game's senior producer. ``We
came up with a five-part structure that allowed us to hit every
major beat point of the film and then design to those points.
During those stages, the player kind of re-enacted or walked in the
footsteps of Flik, the hero, which allowed us to incorporate a lot
of the action elements of the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Storyboards can be cut and pasted from a film. The dynamics of
game play cannot. It took Hollywood a long time to understand that,
which is why movie-based games have been among the most boring ever
released.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, the studios are beginning to realize that you can do
more than put your hero in the standard
running-jumping-and-shooting scenario that prompts jaded eye rolls
among second graders. You can make something original. And Disney
Interactive has done so, in a playful and elegant way.
</P>
<P>
   A Bug's Life incorporates the conventional running and jumping
and shooting. (No deadly projectiles. You hurl large berries at
enemy bugs, and they disappear or run away. This is, after all, a
Disney title.) But most of the game play revolves around collecting
things and using them strategically.
</P>
<P>
   The bug-scale universe is littered with useful objects to be
picked up and transformed. Giant seeds can be hauled around and
dropped. If you jump on them, they sprout. So if a ledge is too
high to climb, you can grow a mushroom, which functions as a
trampoline, and bounce up to the ledge.
</P>
<P>
   If it's too high for you to use a mushroom plant, then you run,
find another seed, grow it into an ivy plant next to the mushroom,
bounce onto the mushroom and leap onto the higher plateau of an ivy
leaf. Then you climb over the wall.
</P>
<P>
   There's a good deal of puzzle-solving in A Bug's Life, but
nothing is arcane (decipher the extraterrestrial runes; play the
ancient musical instrument). The problems mostly involve getting
from point A to point B when you're not strong or tall enough, or
tracking down things that are difficult to find. These are problems
that an 8-year-old can understand.
</P>
<P>
   There are different ways to solve these problems, and there are
different ways to win. You can win by making it through all 15
levels. Or you can win by uncovering everything that is hidden in
the game world _ digging up the buried treasure and unlocking all
the secret doors, covering every inch of virtual ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are very goal-oriented,'' Winters said. ``They
just want to get through the game and finish it and have the
accomplishment of getting through the game. Other people want to go
through and find every single little thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It depends on your definition of winning. In one case, it means
going as far as you can on a linear path from beginning to end. In
the other, it means drilling down from the game's surface through
all of its layers to the core. A video game, like a film, has an
axis of length. But it also has an axis of depth.
</P>
<P>
   That is the most fundamental difference between a cinematic
narrative and an interactive narrative. A film can be cut up,
rewound or fast-forwarded. You can skip around. You can slow it
down. You can notice different things at different times. But you
can't reveal something that was submerged and invisible. There's no
such thing as ``deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bug's Life is a layer cake, in that sense. After every level
of the game, a video clip follows the narrative arc of the movie.
Strung together, the clips constitute a rough sketch of the story.
And if you race through the game, that is what you'll see.
</P>
<P>
   But if you really delve into the environment _ explore every
cranny, solve every puzzle, collect every floating icon and defeat
all the enemies _ a screen pops up, congratulates you and plays a
bonus clip. There are almost 20 minutes of film buried in the game,
and those moments are enhanced precisely because they are hidden
and inaccessible.
</P>
<P>
   If you could simply fast forward to them, it wouldn't be as much
fun. This way, they are like the elusive gold berries or the
propeller plants: objects to be sought, areas to unlock.
</P>
<P>
   Embedded in the game universe, these kernels of film sprout into
the roots and branches of the interactive narrative, just like the
other seeds lying around. They become part of the environment and
part of the player's story. Because in a video game, the
environment (italics)is(end italics) the story.
</P>
<P>
   The player moves through it, gazing around all the while. The
story of a video game is like the story of a theme park, minus
ticket lines and hydraulics.
</P>
<P>
   Video games are theme parks of the mind. And if there's one
thing that Disney knows how to build, it's theme parks: synthetic
environments that contain fragments of its films. Disney knows a
lot about making films into objects and creating a context for
those objects.
</P>
<P>
   The question of translating a linear story into an interactive
story is really a question of context. ``What is the envelope?'' is
the question that defines the design process. If the envelope is
linear and you put little interactive things into it, you get
something that looks like a game but feels like a snaggy,
interrupted movie.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated players ask themselves, ``Why can't I just watch the
movie straight through without the roadblocks and speed bumps?'' If
the envelope is the interactive environment, you get something that
looks like a movie and feels like a decent video game _ and meets
the exacting standards of an 8-year-old.  &QL;

A SWEET DECEIT: THE SECRET'S IN THE SAUCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the holidays over and the rich menus of pies and cakes and
cobblers gone, it is time to seek out a simpler, more deceptive way
of getting our sugar fix.
</P>
<P>
   I think it could be bread pudding.
</P>
<P>
   Bread pudding might be a regular thing at your house, but not at
mine. We are in denial at my home; we never admit having desserts.
We recently bought a birthday cake for our son-in-law and when he
was unable to claim it, we had to quickly eat away the evidence. It
was a two-layer cake, fully iced.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, we ate it while standing, and any nutritionist
worth their sodium will tell you calories don't count if consumed
in the upright position. It is an axiom, if not a constitutional
mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Bread pudding is not a fancy dessert. How damaging can it be
when it doesn't even have icing? It is easy to prepare and it is
truly a comfort food _ warm, good smelling and squishy in your
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   That might not be vital to a lot of people, but to those of us
who grew up thinking it was funny to squish Jell-O through our
teeth, a soothing texture is important.
</P>
<P>
   Also, bread pudding crosses tons of cultural lines. It can be
found in many French cookbooks; one Alsatian recipe I came across
was made with Bing cherries, a fruit-based liqueur and lemon zest.
</P>
<P>
   It is a western dish as well. Today's chuck-wagon cooks often
use leftover biscuits to soak in milk and eggs and sugar. Bread
pudding can be made easily in a Dutch oven.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, it's not too important how the pudding turns out
anyway because most of the cooks pour a whiskey sauce over it, and
the sauce would bring out a nice, delicate, wonderful taste in boot
leather.
</P>
<P>
   Bread pudding recipes are found in Mexican versions, Southern
versions, soul food versions and Cajun versions. I'm sure there are
more variations, but those were the only books I had.
</P>
<P>
   Raisins are generally one of the ingredients in a basic bread
pudding, although I've never cared for them. It has to do with that
texture thing. Some people use fruit cocktail, pecans, candied
orange and lemon peel.
</P>
<P>
   Cinnamon is prominent in many recipes, others use nutmeg, and a
few call for both.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone uses whiskey sauce. Rum is often substituted, and
the pudding is commonly topped with honey, sorghum, fruit glazes,
whipped cream or ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing I don't care for is tightly packed, dense bread
pudding. I don't want to slice my pudding from a brick; I want it
moist and creamy, the way pudding is supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   And, in my opinion, it ought to be reasonably simple. I saw one
recipe for chocolate brioche-English toffee bread pudding, and
although it looked like a luscious dessert, it didn't look like
bread pudding. It was more like a chocolate block that oozed
caramel.
</P>
<P>
   And there was another recipe for ``bread and butter pudding
served with clotted cream and compote of apricots.'' I, and the
rest of the guys down at the feed store, don't eat things that are
clotted.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a reasonably simple recipe our family has enjoyed for
years. I'm not sure where it originated, and probably there have
been so many changes it no longer matters.
</P>
<P>
   Notice it has apples, and that makes it a fruit, not a dessert.
</P>
<P>
   APPLE BREAD PUDDING
</P>
<P>
   Yields 8
</P>
<P>
   8 thin slices stale, firm white bread
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons unsalted butter at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   6 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces frozen unsweetened apple-juice concentrate, defrosted
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup apple jelly
</P>
<P>
   4 Golden Delicious apples
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 pint vanilla ice cream, optional
</P>
<P>
   Butter one side of bread slices with 2 tablespoons of butter.
Cut each slice into quarters. Lightly butter a 6-cup baking dish
with 1 tablespoon of butter. Lay bread evenly in dish, overlapping
slices.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, granulated sugar and
cinnamon until well blended.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium saucepan, combine cream, apple juice and apple
jelly. Bring to simmer over moderate heat. Gradually whisk liquid
into eggs in a thin stream. Pour custard over bread and let stand,
pushing slices down once or twice, until bread is saturated, about
15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Place baking dish in a roasting pan
and add enough warm water to reach halfway up sides of dish. Bake
in center of oven for 45 to 50 minutes, until custard is set.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, quarter, core and peel apples. Cut each quarter into
two wedges. In a large skillet, melt remaining 2 tablespoons
butter. Add apples and saute over moderately high heat, tossing
occasionally until browned, about 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat broiler. Broil pudding about 4 inches from heat until
top is browned, 1-2 minutes. Dust with 1 teaspoon of the
confectioners' sugar, mound sauteed apples on top and sprinkle with
remaining 1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar. Serve warm or at room
temperature with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

 FLAT TVs, STILL FOR THE FAT-WALLET SET, IMPROVE AS PRICES FALL

 (af)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For decades, flat-panel, hang-on-the-wall televisions have been
a staple of science fiction and viewers' fantasies. And not too
long ago, the only place anyone could actually see one was at a
World Fair or geeky science expo.
</P>
<P>
   But now flat-panel plasma televisions are on sale at Circuit
City and other mainstream television retailers nationwide. They are
expensive _ $10,000 or more _ finicky and fragile. And the
technology has not been perfected. Nonetheless, for a variety of
reasons, they almost certainly represent the future of television,
almost within reach.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every television manufacturer showing products last week
at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nev., had plasma
monitors on display, even though the high prices insure that, for
now, they will remain a specialty product.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is straightforward: Current-generation televisions,
the conventional ``direct view'' sets with picture tubes, as well
as projector sets, have reached the end of the technology curve.
And the advent of digital television demands greater capabilities
that old-style televisions cannot easily provide.
</P>
<P>
   Direct-view sets cannot be manufactured to display
full-resolution, high-definition images at anything even
approaching an affordable price. It is simply too hard to squeeze
two million picture elements, or pixels, onto the screen of even a
40-inch conventional set, the largest size possible. (An inviolable
law rules the consumer electronics industry: No television set can
ever be so large that it will not fit through an ordinary door.)
</P>
<P>
   The best of the world's front- and rear-projection televisions
can produce a full-resolution, high-definition image. But they are
also quite expensive, $10,000 or more, and so large that they
cannot happily sit in most family rooms. That is why more than 90
percent of the televisions sold are conventional direct-view sets.
</P>
<P>
   Flat-panel plasma sets can be as large as they need to be, and
still be relatively unobtrusive, because they are extraordinarily
thin. In fact, Pioneer Electronics is selling a 50-inch plasma
monitor capable of displaying high-definition images. And it's just
under four inches deep, about as wide as your hand, so it can
easily fit through a door.
</P>
<P>
   Circuits tested the Pioneer and three other plasma sets,
manufactured by Fujitsu, Philips Electronics and Runco
International. All of them are wide-screen sets. And all but one
are just monitors _ to function, a monitor has to be attached to a
television tuner, which can be accomplished by hooking it to a VCR.
Their prices range from the startling to the absurd: $10,999 to
$25,000.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, a plasma set is arresting. Anyone spying it
invariably walks up and peers around the back to be sure there
isn't an attached piece of necessary equipment built into the wall
somehow. But there isn't.
</P>
<P>
   You can, in fact, hang them up, assuming you have selected a
load-bearing wall. They weigh 80 to 100 pounds. Several recent
magazine advertisements have shown them artfully displayed on a
proud new owner's wall like a piece of fine art, hung unobtrusively
between what looks like a Cezanne and a Monet. Not shown, however,
are the fat cables that feed the set, some nearly as plump as your
arm. They dangle to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   A plasma monitor is like a honeycomb sandwiched between two
sheets of glass. Each cell in the honeycomb represents a pixel and
holds a mixture of neon-xenon gas as well as a tiny bit of
phosphorescent material in one of the three primary colors: red,
green and blue.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny, transparent electrode is attached to the front of each
cell, and another to the back. When a charge is applied to these
electrodes, it passes through the cell, exciting the gas so it
enters a plasma state and begins emitting ultraviolet light. That
excites the colored phosphorescent material, or phosphors, which
then project light to create a picture. In principle, it's a neat,
clean technology, unencumbered by the many technological
limitations that plague conventional televisions.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not to say there are no problems. It turns out that
the electrical process is extraordinarily inefficient. As a result,
plasma displays are dimmer than conventional television sets. It
may not seem immediately intuitive, but that means plasma displays
cannot render the color black.
</P>
<P>
   Televisions, of course, cannot actually project black, which is
simply the absence of light. A television screen portrays the black
portions of a picture outby projecting no light. And we see black
because television screens are tinted that color. When no light is
coming through, you are looking at the black glass.
</P>
<P>
   Direct-view sets are generally as bright as torches so the
picture is strong, even when projected through black-tinted glass.
But plasma sets are so inefficient that the picture would be too
dim to watch if it had to pass through black-tinted glass. As a
result, the darkest images most plasma sets can render are a dark
gray. That gives the picture a noticeably washed-out look.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That said, the technology has come quite a long way. When
Fujitsu put the first one on the market in the Hammacher Schlemmer
mail-order catalog two years ago, at a price of $25,000, buyers
needed to be impressed with the size and shape of the screen
because the picture wasn't very good. Large areas of the picture
were simply missing because the set could render nothing darker
than medium gray.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers looking at an image of a darkened room, for example,
would not be able to see the villains lurking in the shadows; the
screen would depict a dark gray void.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Fujitsu is selling a second-generation model with
a 42-inch screen at half the price _ a mere $10,999 _ and the
picture is much improved. This one can render a very dark gray, so
the problem is much less obtrusive. This is among the least
expensive plasma sets using current technology, and one of the
best.
</P>
<P>
   Philips licensed Fujitsu's plasma technology and used it to
produce its own plasma set, called the Flat TV. It is heavily
advertised in national magazines and costs $15,000, even though the
Philips set produces a picture not quite as good as Fujitsu's. But
the Philips system includes its own television tuner, so there is
no need to connect it to a VCR to receive television programming.
</P>
<P>
   Philips also adds on a multichannel sound system for $4,000. But
you would have to work quite hard to spend that much on your own
for a sound system and not do a whole lot better.
</P>
<P>
   But plasma technology is evolving fast. Each new entry is
notably better, giving power to the idea that plasma displays will
eventually become a mainstream product for consumers not interested
in deciding between a new car and a new television. And the two
latest entries in the market, from Runco and Pioneer, prove the
point.
</P>
<P>
   Runco, a high-end manufacturer of home-theater products, sells a
new 42-inch plasma monitor that is based on a plasma mechanism
manufactured by the NEC Corp., the Japanese computer company.
Brightness measurements show that it projects more light than any
other plasma display on the market right now. That means it can
come closer to portraying true black. This unit costs $13,995,
partly because it comes with a nifty (and expensive) touch-screen
remote control.
</P>
<P>
   Finally comes the Cadillac of the category, Pioneer's
high-definition plasma display, so nicknamed because you could buy
a Cadillac for the price of this television: $25,000. It is 50
inches wide, wider than any conventional direct-view television
sold in the United States. Yet it is only about four inches deep.
</P>
<P>
   The Pioneer monitor can display 983,040 pixels, nearly three
times as many as a conventional television. That is just enough to
allow it to qualify as a high-definition television. But a
full-resolution HDTV can display more than two million pixels. As a
result, when a high-definition signal is fed to this monitor, it
looks quite nice but lacks the clarity and sparkle that makes a
full-resolution signal look almost real.
</P>
<P>
   The Pioneer comes close to the Runco in brightness and the
ability to portray black. But the review sample suffered from
several serious flaws that hampered the picture quality, including
excessive video noise, the kind of on-screen affliction that used
to be called snow. A Pioneer executive said the company was aware
of the problems and working to remedy them.
</P>
<P>
   But then, this is a brand-new product category. Researchers at
several major consumer electronics companies are still trying to
overcome the hurdles that will make plasma displays a mainstream
product, so bumps along the way are not only understandable, but
expected.

 &HT;    EDITORS: RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT
 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of 2.)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I recall that Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) started publicly calling
for President Clinton's impeachment almost immediately after the
president was elected for the first time. Can you refresh my memory
about the sequence of these events?
</P>
<P>
   A: Clinton was first elected president Nov. 3, 1992. He was
inaugurated Jan. 20, 1993. It was more than four years later _
March 1997 _ when Barr wrote a letter to Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.),
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, asking Hyde to consider
beginning an impeachment inquiry of Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent item in Q&AMP;A said bottled waters have had the
fluoride filtered out. Is the same true for those of us using
faucet filters? I've had a PUR water filter for some time, and when
I bought it, I was told it doesn't filter out fluoride. I want the
fluoride for my children's benefit.
</P>
<P>
   A: You're in good shape using a PUR filter. ``None of our
products take out the fluoride in the water,'' Q&AMP;A was told by Judy
Smith of PUR and Recovery Engineering, which makes the PUR drinking
water system. The PUR filter does claim to remove lead and
chlorine, as well as Crypto (Cryptosporidium) and Giardia bacteria.
For more information about what the filter does and does not
remove, call PUR consumer service at 1-800-787-5463 or
1-800-845-7873.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, while fluoride is removed from most bottled waters,
not all are fluoride-free. Gleda James, president of Lithia Springs
Water Co. in Georgia, says her firm's mineral water contains
natural fluoride in the amount of 1.7 milligrams per liter. Doe
information: 770-944-3880.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that ever since Elizabeth Dole became president of
the American Red Cross, contibutions have been down. Is this true?
Can you list the total annual contributions to the Red Cross from
the time she took over until now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although contributions haven't gone up every year under Dole,
they've shown an increase of $181 million over the eight-year
period, according to the American Red Cross. Dole, who became
president of the Red Cross in February 1991, announced recently
that she would step down, prompting speculation that she would be a
Republican candidate for the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions over Dole's eight-year period added up to $3.4
billion, of which more than $650 million was earmarked for disaster
relief, said Red Cross spokesman Bill Maddox. The year-by-year
amounts: 1991, $386 million; 1992, $394.7 million; 1993, $535.6
million; 1994, $504.7 million; 1995, $465.6 million; 1996, $474.4
million; 1997, $493.4 million; 1998, $566.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross is not a government organization, Maddox
pointed out, so it relies on contributions from the public,
businesses, corporations and foundations. During her tenure, Dole
initiated a complete redesign of the organization's fund-raising
practices and launched a new four-year fund-raising growth plan,
Maddox added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We would like to write to Larry Flynt, who is so much in the
news lately for his project to expose what he calls the hypocrisy
of some members of Congress. What is the address?
</P>
<P>
   A: The publisher of Hustler magazine can be contacted at: L.F.P.
Inc., 8484 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 900, Beverly Hills, CA 90211.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the address for the Council of Conservative Citizens,
the organization that Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) spoke to, igniting a
controversy because of its white supremacist views?
</P>
<P>
   A: Write: Council of Conservative Citizens, P.O. Box 221683, St.
Louis, MO 63122. While Barr admits having spoken to the group, he
disassociated himself from it after his appearance was publicized,
saying he initially wasn't aware of its extremist views. That point
was disputed by his critics, however, who maintain that the group's
reputation is well known.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Five women were just sworn in to statewide office in Arizona,
making it the first state to have an all-female elected line of
succession. What are their party affiliations?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gov. Jane Hull, Secretary of State Betsey Bayless, Treasurer
Caro-- Springer and Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa
Graham Keegan are Republicans; Attorney General Janet Napolitano is
a Democrat. Arizona doesn't have a lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting footnote: According to statistics compiled by the
Center for the American Woman and Politics at Rutgers University,
Arizona long has had one of the highest percentages in the nation
of women in state legislatures. This year's percentage: 36.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I get tickets to Super Bowl XXXIV in Atlanta next
January? How much will they cost?
</P>
<P>
   A: A limited number of tickets is made available to the public
through a lottery. To enter the lottery for the 2000 game, send a
certified letter with your request between March 1 and June 1 to:
Super Bowl Ticket Lottery, National Football League, 280 Park Ave.,
New York, NY 10017. Names will be drawn at random for the
opportunity to purchase tickets. A National Football League
spokesman said he expected ``about 5,000'' to be available next
year. Tickets for the Jan. 31 game in Miami are $325 each; the cost
for Atlanta's Super Bowl hasn't yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Often on ``Good Morning America,'' a group of people is shown
saying something like this: ``We are the teachers from the Atlanta
middle schools. Good morning, America!'' How can we do that?
</P>
<P>
   A: First, you need to be aware that a screening process is
involved, and potential subjects for ``GMA faces,'' as they're
called, are backed up for at least six months. But if you want to
try your luck, you need to contact the network's local affiliate,
said ABC publicist Dahlia Roemer in New York. If the local
affiliate determines by its screening that the proposed group is
suitable, if then forwards it to ``Good Morning America'' at ABC
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I haven't seen who will perform the national anthem at this
year's Super Bowl. Do you know?
</P>
<P>
   A: It will be sung by Cher.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent TV commercial for the Audi A6 showed a European city
square scene with a bride, a man on a bicycle, and a man and woman
embracing. The music, sung in a foreign language, was haunting.
Where was it filmed? Who performed the music, and what is the
language?
</P>
<P>
   A: The spot, part of a six-commercial campaign for Audi titled
``Heart,'' was filmed at the Royal Naval Academy in London, said
Joni Madison, head of broadcast production at the ad agency
McKinney &AMP; Silver in Raleigh. The music is a Bulgarian folk song
performed by Mystere de Voix Bulgares, the Bulgarian State Radio
and Television female choir. The particular number in question is
``Polegnala e Todora,'' a love song. The language, of course, is
Bulgarian.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read several items suggesting that Ted Turner might run
for president. Is that true? I would vote for him because he's got
scads of money, so he couldn't be bought by any special-interest
group, and his wife is no wallflower, so maybe he wouldn't get into
any sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's the official response from Turner Broadcasting
spokeswoman Caroline Harkleroad: ``We can confirm that in November,
The New Yorker magazine reported that Mr. Turner said he would like
to run for president. On several occasions in the past, he also has
talked about running, but he has never announced his candidacy. His
current focus is his work as vice chairman of Time Warner Inc. and
his dedication to the United Nations Foundation, the Turner
Foundation and other philanthropic endeavors.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does ESPN stand for?
</P>
<P>
   A: It doesn't stand for anything any more. But when ESPN started
in 1979, it was the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network
(thus, ESPN). However, the full name was dropped in February 1985
when the company adopted a new corporate name, ESPN Inc., and a new
logo. Based in Bristol, Conn., ESPN is 80 percent owned by ABC
Inc., which is an indirect subsidiary of The Walt Disney Co. The
Hearst Corp. holds the remaining 20 percent interest in ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What powers does a president have to grant pardons? Must
other government leaders be consulted? Can pardons be challenged?
How common are they?
</P>
<P>
   A: The presidential power to pardon is absolute. As it has been
interpreted by the courts, the pardon power is one of the few
constitutional powers of the president that does not require the
agreement of Congress or allow for congressional interference.
</P>
<P>
   A challenge is possible, however. Such was the case when
attorney George Murphy brought an action against President Ford
seeking a judicial declaration that Ford's pardon of ex-President
Nixon was unconstitutional. Chief Judge Noel Fox of the U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Michigan validated the
pardon, but took the unusual step of lambasting Ford's decision.
``Evidence now available suggests a strong probability that the
Nixon administration was conducting a covert assault on American
liberty and an insurrection and rebellion against constitutional
government itself,'' Fox declared.
</P>
<P>
   Pardons are not uncommon. President Washington used his pardon
power to help quell the Whiskey Rebellion, and Presidents
Washington, John Adams, Madison, Lincoln, Andrew Johnson and Carter
all have granted amnesties, the latter extended to Vietnam-era
draft evaders. President Bush issued controversial pardons to
several key figures implicated in the Iran-contra scandal during
the Reagan administration, and Nixon pardoned labor leader Jimmy
Hoffa. President Truman pardoned more than 1,500 people who had
violated the Secret Service Act during World War II, and President
Reagan issued nearly 400 pardons during his two terms.

 &HT;    Editors: RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT
 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes.)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or E-mail
him at q&AMP;(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt is back in the
news, can you refresh my memory: When and where was he shot, and
was the person who shot him ever caught?
</P>
<P>
   A: Flynt was shot by a sniper on March 6, 1978, near the
Gwinnett County Courthouse in Lawrenceville, Ga. Gene Reeves, an
attorney who helped defend Flynt against charges that he broke
Georgia's obscenity laws in Gwinnett County, also was wounded. On
the day of the shooting, Flynt and Reeves had eaten at a cafeteria
and as they walked back to court, they were struck by the sniper's
bullets. One pierced Flynt's spine and another cut through his
back, continuing through Reeves' arm and into his abdomen. The
trial was called off and the charges dropped. Flynt was left
paralyzed, but Reeves recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Joseph Paul Franklin, a self-proclaimed white
supremacist, confessed while in an Illinois jail for murder to the
Flynt shooting and other shootings, including the wounding of civil
rights leader Vernon Jordan. Franklin said he shot Flynt because
the pornographer published sexually explicit pictures of an
interracial couple. Franklin was indicted in 1983 in Flynt's
shooting, but Gwinnett prosecutors never brought him to trial
because he already was facing stiffer penalties in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Q: During the NBA strike negotiations, I heard frequent
references to the ``Larry Bird rule'' or the ``Larry Bird
exception.'' What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: That was the rule allowing a team to go over its salary cap
to sign one of its own players who became a free agent. It was so
named because Larry Bird with the Boston Celtics was one of the
first situations it came into play.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was said on a TV quiz show that there are eight time zones
in the United States, but we can count only seven. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are only six time zones in the United States. From the
east: Eastern, Central, Mountain, Pacific, Alaska and
Hawaii-Aleutian. Three other North American times zones (heading
east) are: Atlantic, Newfoundland and Greenland. But Newfoundland
might not be considered a true time zone because it differs from
its neighboring time zones by only a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who was the first secretary-general of the United Nations?
How many have there been since then, and will you list their names
and nationalities?
</P>
<P>
   A: Seven men have served as secretary-general: Trygve Lie of
Norway, 1946-53; Dag Hammarskjold of Sweden, 1953-61; U Thant of
Burma, 1961-71; Kurt Waldheim of Austria, 1972-81; Javier Perez de
Cuellar of Peru, 1982-91; Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt, 1992-96;
and, since Jan. 1, 1997, Kofi Annan of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Four men, educated and world travelers,were discussing the
origin of the expression ``a lion's share'' the other day, and each
had a different explanation. Can you clarify how it came about?
</P>
<P>
   A: A lion's share is the largest portion of anything, and
relates to the term ``leonine contract,'' which means a completely
one-sided agreement. According to the Facts on File Encyclopedia of
Word and Phrase Origins, the source of both is Aesop's fable about
the lion that hunted with several other animals, with the lion
claiming all the spoils of the hunt. One-quarter of the spoils he
claimed as king of beasts; a second quarter because he was braver
than any other animal; a third for his mate and cubs; ``and as for
the fourth, let him who will, dispute it with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the characters on the Taster's Choice TV
commercials? It was sort of a love triangle. Now I don't see them
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   A: The spots fell apart, rather like the complicated
relationships they portrayed. But they kept many viewers enthralled
for a long time. The ad campaign, launched in 1990, had 13
episodes, the last of which was shown in July 1997. It started when
a divorced woman, whose name was never disclosed, knocked on the
door of a neighbor, a single (and suave) gentleman identified as
Michael. She had wanted to borrow some coffee, and he introduced
her to Taster's Choice.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the woman's ex-husband, Andrew, came back into
her life, as did her grown son. Viewers were tantalized about how
it would turn out, but they won't ever know, because the
commercials ended without a climax. In the last one, the ex-husband
arrived to pick up the woman for a date. Michael was clearly
disturbed. The ex-husband was shown calling the next day to
apologize to the woman for creating the awkward scene. ``I'm sorry
about last night,'' he said. She interrupted with a mysterious
``I'm not.'' And that was the end.
</P>
<P>
   In print advertisements in October 1997, Taster's Choice invited
viewers/consumers to decide, through a poll, which man she should
pick. Michael won, but no later commercial ever dramatized the
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If the Atlanta Falcons should go to the Super Bowl in 2000,
when it's scheduled for the Georgia Dome, would the game site have
to be moved to another city?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. So it would be considered a ``home game,'' even though
most people in the Dome would be corporate execs and others from
all over.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recall that years ago, when I was in school, stamps cost 3
cents, and they stayed at that price for the longest time. Do you
know exactly how long?
</P>
<P>
   A: The per-ounce rate was 2 cents on July 1, 1885, said Barry
Ziehl of the U.S. Postal Service. It rose to 3 cents on Nov. 3,
1917, but went back to 2 cents on July 1, 1919. Then on July 6,
1932, it went back up to 3 cents, and didn't rise again (to 4
cents) until Aug. 1, 1958. Ziehl said he couldn't speculate on why
the rate was lowered between 1919 and 1932.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's often mentioned that Republican Rep. J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma is a former college football player. When was that? Did he
also play pro football? How old is he, and does he have a family?
</P>
<P>
   A: Indeed he did play pro ball _ in Canada. From 1981 to 1986,
Watts started for Ottawa and Toronto in the Canadian Football
League. Watts was voted the most valuable player of the Grey Cup
game _ the CFL's equivalent of the Super Bowl _ his rookie season,
said his spokeswoman, Tobi Edwards. Watts had been drafted by the
New York Jets as a running back, but he wanted to play the
quarterback position and went to Canada. Before his entrance into
elective office in 1990 as an Oklahoma State Corp. commissioner,
Watts was best known to many people as the University of Oklahoma
quarterback who led the Sooners to consecutive Big Eight
championships and Orange Bowl victories in 1979 and '80.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. (for Julius Caesar) Watts Jr. was born Nov. 18, 1957, in
Eufaula, Okla., the son of a Baptist minister and policeman who
also traded cattle. The junior Watts graduated from the University
of Oklahoma in 1981 with a B.A. in journalism. He won his seat in
Congress, representing Oklahoma's 4th District, in 1994, and was
re-elected in 1998 with 62 percent of the vote. He and his wife,
Frankie, have five children and live in Norman, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can we use our old 1-cent stamps along with remaining 32-cent
stamps for the new mailing rate, instead of buying the
undenominated supplement stamp that the post office is selling?
Like the new $20 bill, it looks like something somebody printed in
their cellar.
</P>
<P>
   A: You can use any combination of new or old stamps you like, so
long as they add up to 33 cents, said Postal Service spokeswoman
Sandra Harding in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the difference between Coca-Cola Co. and Coca-Cola
Enterprises?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're obviously closely entertwined. As explained in
Hoover's Handbook of American Business 1998, ``Guys in lab coats
and suits at the Coca-Cola Co. concoct the secret recipes and
blitz-market the brand, but Coca-Cola Enterprises does much of the
actual bottling and distribution of Coca-Cola products.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the more official explanation, from CCE's Web site
(http://www.cokecce.com): ``Coca-Cola Enterprises is the world's
largest marketer, producer and distributor of products of the
Coca-Cola Co. We also distribute Dr Pepper and several other
beverage brands in selected territories. We are an independent,
public company traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the
stock symbol CCE.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coca-Cola Co. (stock symbol KO) develops products,
produces the advertising and programs to support those products,
and sells syrup concentrate to Coca-Cola Enterprises and other
bottlers. As a bottler, we combine the product concentrate with
other ingredients to manufacture and package our beverages.
Coca-Cola Enterprises then uses its extensive sales and delivery
force to market and distribute products to retail customers and
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about a plagiarism case involving
authors Danielle Steel and Nora Roberts? What books were involved,
and what was the disposition of the case?
</P>
<P>
   A: Steel wasn't one of the parties. The copyright infringement
lawsuit that shook the world of romance writing down to its
throbbing heart was filed by Roberts in August 1997 against fellow
romance writer Janet Dailey. The suit was settled out of court last
year for an undisclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved two of Dailey's books, ``Aspen Gold'' (1991)
and ``Notorious'' (1996), both of which contained ideas and
passages that she admitted were lifted from works by Roberts.
Dailey said the plagiarism occurred at a time when her husband was
undergoing cancer surgery and she was under great stress. When
asked about the incident last year, Dailey's husband, Bill, told
The Associated Press: ``That's all behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   The plagiarism first came to light when it was posted on the
Internet by readers who cited comparisons between paragraphs in
novels by both writers. Initial reports about the lawsuit said
Roberts was asking Dailey to make a donation to the Literacy
Volunteers of America in lieu of damages, but it wasn't disclosed
if that came to pass in the settlement.

NORM MACDONALD HAS NEW COMEDY ON ABC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Norm Macdonald, fired from NBC's ``Saturday
Night Live'' because Don Ohlmeyer didn't think he was funny, has
taken his game to ABC and a new half-hour comedy called ``The Norm
Show,'' premiering March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why ABC, Macdonald said: ``I like ABC because it's the
American Broadcasting Company, and I think that's nice. `American,'
you know what I'm saying? Whereas NBC is `National,' but they don't
really say what nation. And then the other one (CBS) is a bunch of
freaking Colombians, aren't they?''
</P>
<P>
   (A note to the reader: Macdonald didn't exactly say
``freaking.'')
</P>
<P>
   Then he was asked, why not Fox?
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox I couldn't do because I'm three dimensional.''
</P>
<P>
   In his new show, Macdonald plays a hockey player turned social
worker, albeit an unorthodox one, who is kept in line by his
straight-arrow colleague, played by Laurie Metcalf (``Roseanne'').
The wisecracking native of Quebec said the ``climate of society,''
including the activities of the president of the United States,
paves the way for low-grade humor on television. Always ready with
an opinon, Macdonald added that, if the president's unconventional
use of tobacco products is a crime, ``then I'm (insert profanity
here) Dillinger.''
</P>
<P>
   From the profane, we move to propane, Hank Hill's line of work
on ``King of the Hill.'' More specifically to Chuck Mangione, known
by an older crowd for his 1977 megahit, ``Feels So Good,'' but
probably more familiar to a younger set for his recurring
``appearances'' on Fox's animated series.
</P>
<P>
   Mangione's sense of humor even extends to special engagements,
such as a favor this week to executive producer Greg Daniels, who
hosted about 50 TV critics on a tour of the ``King of the Hill''
studio _ actually a converted law office in an L.A. high rise. For
anyone wanting to know about the show's move from a successful
Sunday slot to a tender Tuesday posting, Daniels pointed to a small
room where Mangione stood alone, ready to play a few bars of
``Feels So Good'' for each visitor.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels' point: Despite a sharp drop in total viewers, ``King of
the Hill'' ratings remains strong in several desirable demographic
categories. A fact sheet of supporting evidence concludes with this
bit of sarcasm: Since the move to Tuesdays, ``Fox's entire Sunday
schedule is down 13 percent in the key adults 18-to-49 demo. That
shouldn't feel so good, but it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for a severe ankle injury, Jenna Elfman might be
more famous for her toe shoes than her tofu. Each summer for three
years in the late '80s, the tall star of ``Dharma and Greg''
studied in Seattle with the Pacific Northwest Ballet, intent on
becoming a great dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Elfman, who plays the peace-loving daughter of 1960s flower
children on her ABC sitcom, says there's a little motor inside her
that keeps her focused and driven. Though her career was redirected
by an injury, Elfman said, ``I don't feel that I can be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to assess her talent as a ballet dancer on a scale from 1
to 10, Elfman said quickly and directly: ``Eight and a half.''

 &HT;    More and more people are moving up to larger TVs, but be warned:
It's not just a case of `the bigger, the better'
 &HT;    By Sandy Amann John
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ David Tillis is so happy with his big-screen
television with surround sound that he had the media room in his
new home specifically designed for the system. The house, now under
construction in north Fulton County, includes pre-wiring and spaces
in the walls for front and rear speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Tillis, a licensed professional counselor, and his family enjoy
watching videos on the 50-inch screen. When they move into the new
home next month, they'll switch from cable to satellite television
for a better picture.
</P>
<P>
   And Tillis is definitely planning to watch Super Bowl XXXIII on
his big-screen TV.
</P>
<P>
   With one of America's heaviest days of TV viewing on the horizon
_ Jan. 31 _ many people are upsizing their TV sets to a big-screen
model, or thinking about it. What should they know before buying?
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association considers any
television with a screen 30 inches or larger to be a big-screen
model. But for most customers, ``big screen'' means at least 40
inches across, said Marshall Bronson, manager of the HiFi Buys
store in Roswell (Ga.). The most popular size among buyers there is
about 50 inches.
</P>
<P>
   When shopping for a big-screen TV, you need to know where you're
going to place it and what you're going to watch on it. The
salesperson will ask you those kinds of questions to help you
select the size that best meets your needs, Bronson said.
</P>
<P>
   Prices start at about $1,500, with most people spending between
$2,000 and $2,500 for a big-screen set, Bronson said. Huge screens
_ 60 inches and bigger _ with high-end features cost much more, as
do more elaborate home theater systems.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that the larger the screen, the more it will
amplify flaws in the picture. On a big screen, the interlace lines
and individual pixels that make up the picture become more visible,
CEMA notes. To make them disappear, you'll need to sit farther from
the screen than with your smaller TV.
</P>
<P>
   So, before you head to the electronics store, measure the room
in which you plan to install the TV. For optimum viewing, CEMA
suggests the ``2.5'' guideline: You should sit 2.5 times as far
from the screen as the screen's diagonal measurement. With a
50-inch screen, for example, try to sit about 10 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Another variable that could affect the screen size you want is
what the consumer electronics industry calls ``sources,'' or where
the picture being viewed comes from: cable, VCR, laser disc,
satellite, etc.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you blow the picture up to 50 inches, some sources don't
look so good,'' Bronson said.
</P>
<P>
   Cable television has a lower-quality picture than a laser disc,
for example. So if cable is your main source of viewing material, a
screen on the smaller end of the big-screen spectrum might be
better. Cable looks ``grainy'' on his screen, Tillis said.
</P>
<P>
   If you're dead set on a humongous screen, Bronson said, you
might want to change the source, by switching from cable to digital
satellite TV, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers also should keep in mind the coming advent of
high-definition television, or HDTV. For most people, a big-screen
set is a purchase that will last 10 years or longer. So it's
important, Bronson said, to buy a system that's flexible _ one that
can be upgraded for HDTV and that can accommodate options such as
digital video discs, or DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, upgrading for HDTV costs about $3,000, Bronson said,
but he expects that price to fall below $1,000 within two years.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the largest of today's big-screen sets are
rear-projection models, in which the picture is projected through
the screen via mirrors. Rear-projection sets are more easily
upgradable to HDTV, which is a major plus, but the screen is
delicate and can be damaged. If you have children or pets, consider
buying a protective screen, or look for a model with a built-in
protective screen. Airborne grease can also damage these screens,
Bronson said, so he recommends a protective screen if the set will
be near a kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   To get the highest-quality picture when selecting a big-screen
television, Bronson recommends that you focus on the
black-and-white elements, not the colors. Every manufacturer has
its own color standards, which makes the same picture look
different, although the colors can be adjusted; the blacks and
whites aren't adjustable, Bronson explained.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to hook up a lot of other gear to your television,
make sure the set you select allows for easy switching among
sources. Another convenience feature to consider is a multibrand
remote control, which will allow you to operate your Sony VCR and
your Mitsubishi television, for example, from one hand.
</P>
<P>
   FOR MORE INFORMATION
</P>
<P>
   More advice on selecting a television is available in ``The
Official Guide to Buying, Connecting and Using Consumer Electronics
Products'' at the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association
Web site, at http://www.cemacity.org/gazette/cebook/.

<P>
   TV terms to know
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Direct-view TV: These television sets _ the kind most of us
grew up with _ house the picture tube, tuner and speakers within
the set.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Projection TV: Includes both a projector and a screen for
viewing the TV picture: It can be front projection (the projector
is in front and projects onto the screen, like a movie projector)
or rear projection, in which the projector is behind the screen and
uses mirrors to get the picture onto the screen.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Big-screen TV: The consumer electronics industry considers any
TV with a diagonal screen measurement of 30 inches or more to be a
big screen, at least for statistical purposes. Most consumers in
the market for a big screen want it to be at least 40 inches,
retailers say.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wide-screen TV: The newest kind of TV features a rectangular
screen resembling the shape of a movie screen. These are also known
as 16:9 screens, because the ratio of width to height is 16 to 9.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  HDTV: High-definition TV, in which digital images result in a
TV picture that is amazingly clear and lifelike. Many stations now
air high-definition broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  DVD: Digital Versatile Disc, the latest video playback
technology. A DVD disc in a DVD player provides much better audio
and video quality than does a VCR, and offers viewers a variety of
options, such as subtitles and different viewing angles and screen
ratios.

MIKE BLEW CHANCE FOR SLAM DUNK

   PHOENIX - Maybe we should all wear black _ warm-ups _
embroidered with the name Jordan. It's only fitting: He's quitting,
so it's time to mourn.
</P>
<P>
   Expect infinite paeans to His Airness, the man/god in the red
jersey numbered 23. Hacks nationwide will effuse about ``balletic
grace'' and ``competitive fire,'' about 10 scoring crowns and six
NBA championship rings. They will wail in prose over the loss of
Michael Jordan, our Christ in high tops.
</P>
<P>
   And they will be so very wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan quitting is exactly what sports needs, for he is a
perfect marker of all that ails sports: The athlete turned
pitchman, a soulless corporate shill; a human being reduced to a
logo; a name manipulated into a slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Be Like Mike, goes the commercial's catchline. Eat Wheaties;
slug Gatorade; munch McDonald's; wear Nikes, Oakley sunglasses and
Hanes underwear; bathe in Michael Jordan cologne; and use a
WorldCom cellular phone _ but have no social conscience whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   The hacks look at Jordan on the court and see basketball
perfection. I look at Jordan in that other arena _ life _ and see
untold unfulfilled potential. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Husksters big losers &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You say he is not a role model, and I sadly nod in agreement _
exactly! But imagine if he had been? Imagine if Michael Jordan had
used all his influence to sell not sports drinks or hot dogs, but
something worth selling?
</P>
<P>
   Then the loss of him would be true tragedy. As it stands now,
the big loser is Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Don't cry for the hucksters, though. There's always videotape:
Last year's jumper against the Jazz to clinch the Bulls' sixth
title; the night when, just out of retirement, Jordan dropped 55 on
the Knicks; the double-pumping buzzer-beater over Craig Ehlo to
knock the Cavaliers out of the 1989 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Such presence on the court. Such a cipher in life.
</P>
<P>
   Think of what Jordan might have done to fight violence after the
murder of his father, James. Think of what a few well-placed words
might have meant, then think only of his silence.
</P>
<P>
   Think of Michael Eugene Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   He was 15 in 1989, a Maryland ninth-grader with a friend named
James Martin and a brand-new pair of Air Jordan basketball
sneakers. Thomas paid $115.50 for the shoes. He also paid with his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Martin strangled his pal. He left the body barefoot in the
woods.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas wasn't the first kid to die over sneakers stitched with
Jordan's number, but he may have been the first dead kid Jordan
learned about. For a 1990 story that detailed how endless hype had
made his Nikes part of gangbangers' uniforms, a ``Sports
Illustrated'' writer gave the superstar a press clipping. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Most Valuable Pitchman &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jordan looked like ``he might cry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone likes to be admired,'' he said, ``but when it comes
to kids actually killing each other . . . then you have to
re-evaluate things.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan again, a few dozen paragraphs later: ``I'd rather
eliminate the product (the shoes) than know drug dealers are
providing the funds that pay me.''
</P>
<P>
   It must have been some re-evaluation. In 1997, Michael Jordan
made $78 million _ about $50 million of it from endorsements.
Yesterday afternoon, Foot Locker was still selling Air Jordans.
</P>
<P>
   For $150 a pair.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not labelling Jordan an accomplice to murder, or blaming him
for a culture where welfare kids lust after sneakers priced higher
than a set of encyclopedias. But he did he benefit from it, then
abdicate what chance he had to help stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Such silence is not the stuff of heroes.
</P>
<P>
   So he will go now, and the mourning will commence. Sports Pundit
Nation has lost its meal ticket. The ad people have lost their Most
Valuable Pitchman. We will wait for the next Jordan, dribbling even
now in a far-off playground.
</P>
<P>
   I imagine that boy, and again I hear the commercial with its
catchline.
</P>
<P>
   Kid, I think, play like Mike. Don't be like Mike. &QL;

NO LIE: IT WASN'T CHERRY, BUT DOOMED TREE WAS ALIVE!

   PHOENIX- As I looked at the letter in my hand from the city of
Phoenix that I received several weeks ago, my blood began to
bubble. It explained that a complaint had been filed against my
front yard, claiming that it contained an inordinate amount of
trash and overgrown weeds.
</P>
<P>
   With my hands shaking, I wondered out loud if this was a joke.
While it's plainly obvious that my landscape will never appear on
the cover of ``House &AMP; Garden,'' the city of Phoenix had to be
kidding. Maybe we didn't mow as often as we should, but rest
assured a small child never got lost in the grass, nor had anyone
mistaken it for a cornfield. (That was at my old house.)
</P>
<P>
   When we bought our little house two years ago, it had been
vacant for another two years before that. The yard was a dirt
parking lot, and virtually every one of the 16 trees on the
property was brown, cracked and dead. Eventually, we pulled most of
them out, with the exception of an ancient orange tree that escaped
the chain saw.
</P>
<P>
   It had one green branch that made my husband insist that the
tree was still alive, but it also survived because the chain saw
was stolen before we got to that side of the yard. Since then, I've
requested a chain saw at every birthday and Christmas to take the
tree down, but until I got a note from my old therapist, no one
would let me have one.
</P>
<P>
   On a hunch, I sought out all of my neighbors and discovered, not
to my surprise, that we had all received the same letter on the
same day. There could be only one culprit, I decided, as I shot an
evil eye toward his house. It had to be the Neighborhood Nemesis,
or, as he likes to call himself, the president of the neighborhood
association _ a man who doesn't even have a yard, only a small
strip of grass as wide as my thigh.
</P>
<P>
   I once attended an association meeting, but when Neighborhood
Nemesis proudly boasted that he spent the majority of his nights
running up and down his street armed with a video camera taping his
neighbors, I became too freaked out to go anymore. The letter was
plainly the result of his walking up and down my street, writing
down what he didn't like, and then calling the city to rat us out.
</P>
<P>
   I was loading the eggs and a big slingshot into the car when my
husband came home from work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this!'' I yelled as I waved the letter in front of
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing with all of those eggs, honey?'' my husband
said slowly. ``Oh God, please tell me you didn't buy a mongoose
today!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a mongoose,'' I said smugly, handing over the complaint.
``I'm gonna catch myself a rat!''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with our yard!'' my husband yelled as he
read the letter and then pointed, ``That tree is ALIVE!!''I
haven't seen him that mad since a bartender carded him, laughed and
said, ``Does your sister know you have her license?''
</P>
<P>
   We jumped in my car to drive to the Nemesis' house to launch our
attack, but there he was, standing out in his front strip,
videotaping stuff. I stumbled for an insult to yell, but all I
managed to say was, ``It's ALIVE!!'' Then we went home and had
omelets for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, I was eating an egg salad sandwich when someone
knocked on my door, a raggedy man who asked if I needed any yard
work done. I smiled as if God had sent him there himself. It had to
be a sign.
</P>
<P>
   I motioned toward the orange tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty bucks,'' he said through the gap where his teeth used to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you knock it down before my husband comes home?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   Before I knew it, the man, whose name was Jerry, took a running
start and jumped on the tree, breaking off massive branches with
his bare hands. I went back inside, too afraid that I'd be called
as a witness in a suit against me after Jerry had impaled himself
on a twig. With every loud ``SNAP!'' that I heard from within my
office, I got more and more frightened.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of guy does yardwork for a living without tools, I
wondered. Where were his teeth? Who breaks apart a tree with his
hands? Through the window, I peeked outside, and that's when I saw
two of them, Jerry and his ``assistant,'' violently swinging on the
tree like monkeys as they rocked it back and forth. Then they
landed and kicked it until it was dead.
</P>
<P>
   I sat down and wrote an e-mail to my editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two homeless guys trying to kick down the dead orange
tree in my front yard,'' I typed. ``I'm going to describe them to
you so if they end up robbing and killing me, you can give the
police a lead: Guy No. 1, Jerry: No teeth. Short. Guy No. 2: Some
teeth. Shorter.''
</P>
<P>
   I ran outside to assess the damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very nice,'' I nodded at Jerry, who was emphatically
grinning and nodding back. ``Now you have to leave before my
husband comes home. Here's some eggs.''
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, my husband's truck pulled up in front of the
house. He got out slowly, glared at me and then walked inside
without saying a word.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tree is gone!'' I said excitedly, with a big smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I wouldn't say that,'' he answered. ``The tree is not
gone. It's lying in 500 pieces around the yard. Who are those guys?
Why are you talking to strangers when you're in the house alone?
Who told you to mutilate the tree? You've ruined everything!''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were only four green leaves left on that tree,'' I said
quietly. ``I was pretty sure that a comeback was out of the
question.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not it!'' my husband yelled. ``Now I have to take back
your Christmas present!''
</P>
<P>
   I gasped with glee. ``But the therapist wouldn't write the note
when I asked her,'' I said, jumping up and down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK,'' my husband said, shuffling toward his study. ``I
bought an electric-powered chain saw so if I run away fast enough,
you can only chase me so far.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tree in the back yard with only six green leaves on
it,'' I suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ALIVE!'' my husband shot back. &QL;

   French Bread
</P>
<P>
   (From Nancy Johnson, BreadCrafters Bakery &AMP; Cafe)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons fresh or 1 1/2 teaspoons dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   11 1/2 to 12 ounces water (76 to 80 degrees)
</P>
<P>
   2 cups (9 ounces) unbleached bread flour
</P>
<P>
   2 cups (9 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour, plus additional
flour for the work surface
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in 11 ounces of water. In a
separate bowl, mix flours together. (To measure flour, spoon flour
into a 1-cup measuring utensil, then, using the back of a straight
knife or a spatula, sweep the top to level.)
</P>
<P>
   Add 1 cup of flour to the water/yeast mixture and stir
vigorously. Continue adding flour by the 1/2 cup until the mixture
becomes too difficult to stir.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer mixture to a floured work surface and begin kneading
dough by folding it onto itself and then pushing away with the heel
of your hand. Give the dough a one-quarter turn and repeat the fold
and push sequence.
</P>
<P>
   If, after 2 to 3 minutes, dough seems stiff, flatten dough into
a circle and sprinkle with additional water.
</P>
<P>
   After kneading for a few minutes, pick up the dough piece by one
end and slap it down hard onto the work surface several times.
(This helps to develop the gluten in the dough and cuts down the
amount of kneading required.)
</P>
<P>
   1st Rest: Round the dough into a ball, cover lightly with
plastic wrap and let dough rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After the rest, flatten dough into a circle and sprinkle with
salt. Knead for 2 to 3 minutes, then repeat picking up dough and
slapping it onto the work surface.
</P>
<P>
   2nd Rest: Again, round the dough into a ball, cover, and let
rest 10 to 15 minutes. After 2nd rest, finish kneading until dough
is smooth and elastic.
</P>
<P>
   1st Rise: Round dough into a ball and place in a deep, narrow
glass or plastic container. Cover container with plastic wrap and
place dough in a draft-free location. Let dough rise until double
in bulk, checking after 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2nd Rise: When dough has doubled, deflate it by pressing down in
the center of the mass, then pulling in the outer edges. Turn ball
of dough over and re-cover to let rise a second time _ usually half
the time of the first rising.
</P>
<P>
   After second rise, transfer dough to a lightly floured work
surface and deflate by gently patting dough out with the palms of
the hand.
</P>
<P>
   Divide dough into 2 equal pieces, cover and let rest for 20
minutes before shaping.
</P>
<P>
   To shape: Take a piece of the dough and flatten it into a
circle. Fold the top 1/3 down so that the edge of the dough is in
the center of the circle. Seal the seam with the side of your hand.
Repeat with the bottom 1/3 of the circle and seal again. Fold the
top of the dough piece down to meet the bottom edge of the dough
and seal again with the side of your hand. Turn dough so that the
seam side is on the bottom and gently roll the piece back and forth
on the table, tapering the ends as you roll.
</P>
<P>
   If using a baking stone, place loaves seam-side down on a
lightly floured or cornmeal-dusted sheet of parchment paper that
has been placed on a rimless cookie sheet or on the bottom of an
overturned rimmed cookie sheet. If not using a stone, omit
parchment paper and place loaves directly on a floured or
cornmeal-dusted sheet pan, preferably a perforated pan.
</P>
<P>
   Cover loaves with a clean, damp kitchen towel and let rise in a
draft-free area until 1 1/2 times original size, or until a slight
indentation remains when dough is pressed with a fingertip.
</P>
<P>
   To bake: Turn oven to 450 degrees and place rack in center of
oven. If using a baking stone, place stone on middle rack and let
oven preheat for 30 to 45 minutes. Before baking loaves, slash the
top of each loaf with a sharp serrated knife or a razor blade. Hold
the knife or blade almost horizontal to the surface and cut under
the crust that has formed on the loaf.
</P>
<P>
   Using a spritzer bottle filled with water, quickly spray the
walls and floor of the oven, avoiding the oven light _ it may
break.
</P>
<P>
   If using a baking stone, slide the parchment paper with the
loaves directly onto the stone. If not using a stone, place the
sheet pan onto the middle rack of the oven. Spray again with the
water and quickly shut the door.
</P>
<P>
   Continue misting the oven with water every 2 to 3 minutes during
the first 10 minutes of baking.
</P>
<P>
   Bake until loaves are a rich, golden color and sound hollow when
tapped on the bottom, or until an internal temperature of 200
degrees is reached, about 18 to 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 2 loaves, about 15 servings, or 10 to 12 rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Sponge method: Using the sponge method will give your bread more
character, as the grain has more time to develop flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Working from the same recipe as given above, take 2 cups of the
flour, 8 ounces of water and 1/2 the amount of yeast and place in a
glass or plastic container with enough room to allow the mixture at
least to triple in volume. Stir the flour, water and yeast together
vigorously until a thick, stringy batter known as a sponge forms.
</P>
<P>
   Cover the container with plastic wrap and let sit at room
temperature for 4 to 24 hours before using in the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   To continue with the recipe, scrape the sponge into a large
mixing bowl, add the remaining water and yeast and stir until
frothy. Add the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the
mixture becomes too difficult to stir. Then transfer the dough to
your work surface and begin kneading procedure as directed above.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight-Rise method: Using only 1/2 to 3/4 of the amount of
yeast listed, follow the recipe above through the final kneading.
Then place dough into a glass or plastic container that has been
lightly oiled or sprayed. Turn dough ball over so that the surface
is lightly oiled. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and place in your
refrigerator overnight, or until doubled in bulk. Let dough return
to room temperature, about 2 hours, before proceeding with recipe
at the point of dividing the dough.
</P>
<P>
   Variations: Before slashing and baking the loaves, spritz the
surfaces with water and sprinkle the loaves with sesame seeds.
</P>
<P>
   When shaping the loaves, flatten the dough into the circle as
described, then sprinkle with your favorite fresh or dried herbs.
Shape as directed and you will have a swirl of herbs in your
loaves.
</P>
<P>
   Substitute 1/4 cup of whole-wheat flour for some of the
unbleached white flour in the recipe. &QL;

Whole-Wheat Pizza Crust
</P>
<P>
   (From Peg Rhodes)
</P>
<P>
   1 package active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup warm water (110 to 115 degrees)
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups whole-wheat flour
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups unbleached white flour plus 1/2 cup as needed
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Stir yeast and sugar into warm water in a small bowl. Cover and
let stand 5 to 10 minutes, or until yeast is foamy. In the large
bowl of a heavy-duty mixer, stir together 1 1/2 cups each of
whole-wheat and white flour and salt. Make a well in the center.
Pour in oil and dissolved yeast. Beat until dough starts to form a
ball. Remove from bowl and knead on a lightly floured board; add no
more than 1/2 cup white flour to the board if needed. Knead until
smooth and elastic.
</P>
<P>
   Spray inside of a large plastic bag with non-stick coating.
Place dough inside. Press the air out and coil the bag from the
dough all the way to the top. Knot the top. This allows the bag to
spread as the dough expands.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerate overnight, or 4 to 6 hours. Press dough down if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   To use: divide into 2 balls. Roll each into an 11-inch circle.
Place on oiled 12-inch pizza pans. Top as desired. Bake in
preheated 450-degree oven 20 minutes, or until bottom is browned.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 2 pizza crusts, 8 servings each.
</P>
<P>
   Variations: 1) Add 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese to
flour mixture.
</P>
<P>
   2) Add 1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary (or 1 teaspoon dried)
and 1 teaspoon chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   3) Add 1/4 cup chopped green olives. &QL;

processor; pulse 2 times, or until blended. With processor on,
slowly add water and 2 tablespoons oil through food chute; process
until dough forms a ball.
</P>
<P>
   Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until
smooth and elastic (about 5 minutes), adding enough of remaining
flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, to prevent dough from sticking.
</P>
<P>
   Place dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning
to coat top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free
from drafts, 10 minutes. (Dough will not double in bulk.)
</P>
<P>
   Punch dough down; turn out onto a lightly floured surface.
Divide dough into 12 equal portions, shaping each portion into a
4-inch circle. Place on 2 large baking sheets coated with cooking
spray and dusted with cornmeal. Cover and let rise 40 minutes or

Whole-Wheat Bread
</P>
<P>
   (From ``Cooking Light'' magazine)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 packages dry yeast (about 4 1/2 teaspoons)
</P>
<P>
   2 cups warm water
</P>
<P>
   3 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 cups whole-wheat flour, divided use
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   Cooking spray
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sunflower seed kernels
</P>
<P>

THINGS BAKERS KNEAD TO KNOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY WALKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Tips for at-home bakers:
</P>
<P>
   - Accurate measurement is so important that it cannot be
overemphasized.
</P>
<P>
   - Use bottled or filtered water in bread recipes if your tap
water is hard.
</P>
<P>
   - Store whole-grain flours, nuts, seeds and other ingredients
that have oil in them in the freezer in airtight containers.
Otherwise, they'll go rancid, which doesn't take long in warm
desert-area pantries.
</P>
<P>
   - Use a pastry scraper (also called a dough scraper or case
knife) to scoop soft dough off the pastry board when you knead.
It's also extremely useful for cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   - If dough tries to spring back to its original shape when
kneading, rolling out for pizza crust or shaping into loaves, let
it rest, covered, for 10 or 15 minutes, so the gluten can relax.
</P>
<P>
   - Instead of ``lightly flouring'' the board before you turn out
dough to shape it, spray your kneading board with non-stick spray.
Spray your hands, too.
</P>
<P>
   - A 1-pound loaf of bread made with 3 cups of flour will bake up
much prettier in a medium-size loaf pan, 8{ by 4{ by 2{ inches,
instead of in a 9- by 5- by 3-inch loaf pan. The loaf will be domed
in the smaller pan, and flat in the larger one.
</P>
<P>
   - How do you tell when dough has risen enough? Press a finger
lightly into the dough. If the indentation remains, the dough has
risen enough. (In loaf pans, for best shape, the dough should be
risen slightly above the edge of the pan.)
</P>
<P>
   - Always preheat the oven, unless the recipe says not to.
</P>
<P>
   - In case your oven has hot spots, rotate and turn loaves during
baking onto different oven racks when you bake more than two
loaves.
</P>
<P>
   - When it comes out of the oven, let bread cool at least 20
minutes before slicing.
</P>
<P>
   - Let bread cool completely on a rack before wrapping for
storage.
</P>
<P>
   - Slice bread before freezing it, if you're going to use it for
breakfast toast. That way, you can remove one slice at a time.
</P>
<P>
   - Doughs can be frozen after the first rise, after they are
punched down. Let doughs thaw to room temperature, then shape and
let rise again before baking. Or bake the bread, then freeze it for

   - Specialty tools for bakers abound. Kitchen stores have lots of
things, from pans to dough scrapers to dough buckets marked inside
to let you know how much the dough has risen. More hard-to-locate
items, such as the French lame, a razor-sharp tool for slashing
loaves, are available through The Baker's Catalogue, 800-827-6836,
published by King Arthur Flour in Vermont. The catalog is also an
excellent resource for hundreds of items such as specialty flours,
salts, yeasts, and additives such as diastatic malt powder, a
natural ingredient used in professional bakeries. These people are
devoted to baking, and even produce a fantastic bimonthly
newsletter with recipes. &QL;

<P>
   PHOENIX - Maybe we should all wear black _ warm-ups _
embroidered with the name Jordan. It's only fitting: He's quitting,
so it's time to mourn.
</P>
<P>
   Expect infinite paeans to His Airness, the man/god in the red
jersey numbered 23. Hacks nationwide will effuse about ``balletic
grace'' and ``competitive fire,'' about 10 scoring crowns and six
NBA championship rings. They will wail in prose over the loss of
Michael Jordan, our Christ in high tops.
</P>
<P>
   And they will be so very wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan quitting is exactly what sports needs, for he is a
perfect marker of all that ails sports: The athlete turned
pitchman, a soulless corporate shill; a human being reduced to a
logo; a name manipulated into a slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Be Like Mike, goes the commercial's catchline. Eat Wheaties;
slug Gatorade; munch McDonald's; wear Nikes, Oakley sunglasses and
Hanes underwear; bathe in Michael Jordan cologne; and use a
WorldCom cellular phone _ but have no social conscience whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   The hacks look at Jordan on the court and see basketball
perfection. I look at Jordan in that other arena _ life _ and see
untold unfulfilled potential. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Husksters big losers &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You say he is not a role model, and I sadly nod in agreement _
exactly! But imagine if he had been? Imagine if Michael Jordan had
used all his influence to sell not sports drinks or hot dogs, but
something worth selling?
</P>
<P>
   Then the loss of him would be true tragedy. As it stands now,
the big loser is Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Don't cry for the hucksters, though. There's always videotape:
Last year's jumper against the Jazz to clinch the Bulls' sixth
title; the night when, just out of retirement, Jordan dropped 55 on
the Knicks; the double-pumping buzzer-beater over Craig Ehlo to
knock the Cavaliers out of the 1989 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Such presence on the court. Such a cipher in life.
</P>
<P>
   Think of what Jordan might have done to fight violence after the
murder of his father, James. Think of what a few well-placed words
might have meant, then think only of his silence.
</P>
<P>
   Think of Michael Eugene Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   He was 15 in 1989, a Maryland ninth-grader with a friend named
James Martin and a brand-new pair of Air Jordan basketball
sneakers. Thomas paid $115.50 for the shoes. He also paid with his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Martin strangled his pal. He left the body barefoot in the
woods.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas wasn't the first kid to die over sneakers stitched with
Jordan's number, but he may have been the first dead kid Jordan
learned about. For a 1990 story that detailed how endless hype had
made his Nikes part of gangbangers' uniforms, a ``Sports
Illustrated'' writer gave the superstar a press clipping. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Most Valuable Pitchman &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jordan looked like ``he might cry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone likes to be admired,'' he said, ``but when it comes
to kids actually killing each other . . . then you have to
re-evaluate things.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan again, a few dozen paragraphs later: ``I'd rather
eliminate the product (the shoes) than know drug dealers are
providing the funds that pay me.''
</P>
<P>
   It must have been some re-evaluation. In 1997, Michael Jordan
made $78 million _ about $50 million of it from endorsements.
Yesterday afternoon, Foot Locker was still selling Air Jordans.
</P>
<P>
   For $150 a pair.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not labelling Jordan an accomplice to murder, or blaming him
for a culture where welfare kids lust after sneakers priced higher
than a set of encyclopedias. But he did he benefit from it, then
abdicate what chance he had to help stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Such silence is not the stuff of heroes.
</P>
<P>
   So he will go now, and the mourning will commence. Sports Pundit
Nation has lost its meal ticket. The ad people have lost their Most
Valuable Pitchman. We will wait for the next Jordan, dribbling even
now in a far-off playground.
</P>
<P>
   I imagine that boy, and again I hear the commercial with its
catchline.
</P>
<P>
   Kid, I think, play like Mike. Don't be like Mike. &QL;

   Move over, Martha Stewart and Jaclyn Smith. Costing less means
selling more. Or so Michael Graves hopes.
</P>
<P>
   The former poster boy of post-modern architecture is coming out
with a line of kitchen accessories for Target, the discount chain.
By Jan. 27, the first 150 items of the Graves Design Collection
will be on display at Target's 851 stores, priced from $3.99 for a
spatula called the Hipper Flipper to $40 for a toaster whose fluid
shape recalls a Bakelite radio (it's nicknamed ``Toast Modern'') to
an Indonesian-hardwood patio set for $499.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not blessing towels,'' Graves said dismissively of the
comparison with Martha Stewart and K-Mart. ``It is not licensing,
but designing.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the first samples arrived in Graves' own kitchen in
Princeton, N.J. Seeing the finished products for the first time,
the architect picked up a blue-handled garlic press and let his eye
trail over the rotund white electric can opener. A chubby peeler,
Graves said, was ``nice enough to take to bed.'' (A Graves bed with
Graves sheets, ideally, and Graves alarm clock nearby _ though beds
and sheets are not yet items Target has designs on.)
</P>
<P>
   With the Graves Collection, Target is bringing something new to
the giant discount stores on America's exurban strips: it wants to
make an architect's name into a house brand. The time seems right.
People accustomed to a beaming Martha Stewart face on K-Mart
placards are likelier to be ready for a high-design pitch at
Target, where customers have a higher average household income _
around $47,000 _ than in other discounters, and are more likely to
have college degrees. Target also enjoys a reputation for wit and
something like chic. Its ads mingle housewares and clothing: a
dollar and a half of paper clips made into a woman's shirt, a
pleated lampshade turned into a skirt. It is not only in Graves'
Princeton studio that the the company name is pronounced a la
francaise: tar-ZHAY.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Graves, 64, declared himself as proud of the products as of
anything he has ever done. Prouder, presumably, than of the
flamboyant Portland Building, the lavish headquarters for Humana in
Louisville, Ky., or the whimsical Walt Disney World hotel or the
intimate San Juan Capistrano Library.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the better part of the '80s and '90s, Graves was
considered at the cutting edge,'' said Reed Kroloff, the editor in
chief of Architecture magazine. ``But the cutting edge is very
fickle these days, and it's safe to say he is at the cutting edge
no longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Graves' most singular area of triumph may lie
elsewhere. ``Whatever you think of his architecture,'' Kroloff
continued, ``there is no architect alive who has managed to cross
markets with such success, even in this age of hypermarketing.''
</P>
<P>
   He has designed high-end products for Steuben, Lenox,
Spinneybeck , Swid Powell and Vorwerk; has appeared in magazine
advertising for Dexter shoes and Miele appliances, and then
upgraded the Miele endorsement into a commission to design the
company's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In the popular mind, Graves is perhaps best known for his 1985
teakettle for the Italian Alessi company, with its famed bird
whistle: more than 1 million have been sold, at $150. Its U.S.
cousin, for Target, with its reverse-mounted handle and a whistle
like a Cracker Jack prize, set backwards so it also suggests a
pointing finger, will sell for $35.
</P>
<P>
   The two teakettles _ couture versus off-the-rack _ suggest the
difference in the decades: if the '80s were about simple
ostentation, the '90s have brought ostentatious simplicity. Nowhere
is the difference more evident than in the success of discounters
like Target. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Part of Dayton Hudson Corp. of Minneapolis, the number of Target
stores has grown more than tenfold, from 80 a decade ago. Sales,
which totaled $21 billion last year, are growing at about 13
percent a year, according to the company's figures. This year will
bring 65 or so new stores, many in the Northeast, joining recent
openings in College Point, Queens, and West Nyack, N.Y., a company
spokesman said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving money is chic,'' said Kurt Barnard, who publishes
Barnard's Retail Trend Report, an industry newsletter. Even those
who can afford to pay more go to discounters _ a trend that Barnard
said will bloom as consumers shift their spending from clothing to
products for the home.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Target, which spends an estimated $500 million annually on
advertising and marketing, refused to reveal the size of its
investment in the Graves Collection, but its ambitions are clear:
the kickoff party next Wednesday will be held at the Whitney Museum
of American Art.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney itself is not a site of triumph for Graves. In the
mid-1980s, he produced two ambitious expansion plans for the
museum. Neither was built, thanks largely to opposition from
architects and others who charged that the designs overwhelmed
Marcel Breuer's original modernist building.
</P>
<P>
   But Target planners said they were not conscious of any irony:
``We do not believe most of our guests will know him, but we think
they will recognize great design,'' said Ron Johnson, a vice
president and merchandising manager for home decor.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Company brands seem to be to the '90s what designer names were
for the '80s. Not knowing Graves may be an advantage.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Target is counting on the designs to catch the shopper's eye.
The Graves kitchen appliances and utensils share a palette of
colors _ blue handles and yellow and red knobs _ and a vocabulary
of forms based on an elongated egg shape: this is reassuring
off-the-shelf taste.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Target wants to sell Graves as a '90s brand like Bodum, whose
housewares the company introduced with great success in 1997, or
like Calphalon, whose cookware the stores will also soon begin
selling at prices 10 percent below those of Williams-Sonoma. The
company is locked in a battle with other chains called ``big box''
stores because they are housed in huge, windowless cinderblock
piles on the malls of America. Nabbing Graves accords with Target's
longterm strategy of seeking products its competitors don't have.
``A Target exclusive'' is a recurrent phrase in its catalogs.
Without this cachet the only thing to compete on is price _ and
even Target's roster of 851 stores cannot match Wal-Mart's 3,000
and K-Mart's 2,300. The casualties of such wars are all along the
strips: Bradlees and Caldor's are operating in Chapter 11; Janeway
is gone.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When it is suggested to the architect that Target customers may
even think Michael Graves is an invented figure like Betty Crocker,
he is unfazed.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company's relationship with Graves began after Target
pitched in $6 million for the renovation of the Washington Monument
and asked him to do an elegant scaffolding. With his professed
admiration for ancient shapes, he conceived of the scaffold as a
second, larger obelisk, to keep the monument visible. It also made
Target's involvement more visible.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While working on it, Graves met Johnson of Target's home decor
division. ``We've been knocking you off for years,'' Graves recalls
Johnson saying, ``so why not go right to the source?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, they went to a Target store, where Johnson asked for
advice. Graves offered to put yellow Post-It notes on all the
products whose design his office could improve. Johnson worried
there might not be enough Post-Its. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But what struck Graves most was an exquisite $18 glass vase that
he saw again a few days later on Madison Avenue for $180. ``That
told me something about the purchasing power of 850 stores,''
Graves recalled.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Graves products are manufactured by long-time Target
suppliers like Black &AMP; Decker and Miro and meet the down-to-earth
functional requirements of Middle America. Even the design language
_ they are being promoted as a ``family of objects'' _ suggests
family values, even family relations, made flesh: the pepper
grinder, for example, looks like the offspring of the blender.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started with the notion that most of the things in the
kitchen you touch,'' said Graves. ``When you pick up a spatula you
want to touch a cool handle and know that it will feel good. These
things are not so abstracted as modernist design objects where you
don't know which end to pick up.''
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Graves read a survey of architects and
designers talking about the perfect shape. Someone cited the egg.
The hemispheric shape ``is easy to recognize as something you want
to touch, whether on a teapot or spatula or garlic press,'' Graves
said. ``We also colored them similarly. There's the metaphor of
blue for cool on a handle versus red for, say, the whistle of the
teakettle.'' The same cues exist in the Alessi teakettle.
</P>
<P>
   The egg may even subliminally suggest nurture. This is a more
mellow, less grave Graves: the references to Thebes are left on the
patio _ in the outdoor furniture. The culture of inspiration here
seems to be mid-century Middle America Art Deco and moderne _
Dreyfuss toasters or mixers of the 1940s and 1950s. The handles
recall the enameled wooden utensils sold at Woolworth's half a
century ago.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Graves has lived with such items. ``I shopped at flea
markets and found multicolored plates and bone-handled flatware,''
he said. ``I had a half-moon shaped Sunbeam toaster with a little
light and chrome strips. All this was in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The appliances reflect an era of informality and avoid all sense
of the weight of the precious and the collectible. They are to
Sunbeam mixers as the cartoon cars in ``Roger Rabbit'' are to the
real thing. The kettle looks like a Keystone Cop directing traffic;
its whistle sounds like a train's. If there is anything '90s about
the objects it is this: they seem made for kitchens increasingly
used as de facto family rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But there are problems. The kettle's egglike handle is awkward,
steam can lift the lid, and the removable whistle is almost too hot
to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Kroloff of Architecture magazine, said: ``Graves' designs have a
comfortable, timeless quality and widespread appeal. They look like
design.''
</P>
<P>
   But will they become collectibles for Everyshopper in Cordova,
Tenn., or Mason City, Iowa? To urge buyers on, Target has conceived
of a special teakettle billboard that will emit real steam. Look
for egg-shaped designer puffs.

UNABOMBER RELATIVES DONATE REWARD TO HELP CRIME VICTIMS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _20In an effort to avoid a potentially huge tax
bill, David Kaczynski will establish a special fund for crime
victims with $535,000 of the $1 million he received for turning in
his brother, convicted Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski.
</P>
<P>
   David Kaczynzki of Schenectady, N.Y., unveiled the new ``Unabom
Survivors Fund'' on Monday. It will be managed by an Albany-based
charity that administers some $18 million for individuals,
businesses, foundations and other nonprofit organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The Unabom fund is designed to satisfy Internal Revenue Service
rules that would otherwise have required David Kaczynski to pay
about a third of the reward in income taxes _ along with gift taxes
each time he gave out donations of more than $20,000, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, according to the foundation that will manage it, will
be tax-exempt and help victims of violent crimes committed by
paranoid schizophrenics, but only in the seven states in which the
Unabomber struck, and only over the years in which he was active _
1978 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   If the money were used only for the Unabomber's victims, it
wouldn't be eligible for tax-exempt status, tax lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The Community Foundation for the Capital Region, which will
manage the fund, will open applications to victims of criminal
paranoid schizophrenics in California, Connecticut, Illinois,
Michigan, New Jersey, Tennessee and Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski said $465,850 of the $1 million federal reward will
pay his brother's legal fees and taxes on the taxable portion of
the reward.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski, a social worker, and his wife, Linda Patrik, a
philosophy professor at Union College in Schenectady, still face
legal bills of their own. They plan to pay them, they said Tuesday,
from an anticipated book or movie based on their life story.
</P>
<P>
   Anything left over, they said, will also go to victims, but, she
added without giving details, ``It's much less than you would
imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski and Patrik in 1996 became suspicious that his
reclusive brother, living then in a Montana cabin, was the
Unabomber after his 35,000-word manifesto on the evils of
technology was published in The Washington Post. Through an
attorney, they approached the FBI about their suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Kaczynski, whose bombing spree claimed three lives and
injured 29 others, is serving multiple life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a terrible tragedy,'' David Kaczynski said of
his brother's crimes. ``We're one step closer to having some
closure and resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Insisting they never wanted to profit personally from the
Unabomber's crimes, Kaczynski and Patrik last year worked with Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-New York, to insert a provision in a
$500 million spending bill that would allow them to give the entire
$1 million reward to victims, tax free. ``We always wanted as much
money as possible to go to the victims,'' Patrik said.
</P>
<P>
   But their effort failed in the final days of last year's
congressional session.
</P>
<P>
   Patrik said she hoped the money would go in particular to the
families of those who died _ Thomas Mosser, a New Jersey public
relations executive, Gilbert Murray, a California timber industry
executive, and Hugh Scrutton, a California computer dealer.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ From a hillside overlooking the border with Mexico,
you can see the many obstacles that illegal aliens and drug
smugglers must navigate to enter the United States. There is a
steel fence cutting across miles of scrub, stadium lights that
illuminate the night and hundreds of government agents posted in
vans and inspection booths.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, the border is being fortified with yet another
line of defense that even the fastest sprinter may have trouble
eluding. Whether using stealth or crossing legally by car, citizens
and noncitizens alike must now overcome a barrier of computer
chips, copper wires, video monitors and camera lenses.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster its effort to stop lawbreakers from entering the
country and to speed along the law-abiding, who sometimes wait for
hours to cross the border with a truck or car, the government is
enlisting the help of technology. Within the first moments of
entering the United States, most travelers become the focus of
electronic scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are clearly coming into the 20th century just in time,''
said Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is that more true than here in San Diego, where
thousands of people cross the border, legally and illegally, each
day. The federal agencies that oversee the frontier have installed
an array of gadgets that can, for example, find hidden compartments
where drugs may be stashed, scan license plates to see if a car is
stolen and help law enforcement agents see people concealed in the
bushes.
</P>
<P>
   The investment in border technology is part of a larger effort
to control the nation's frontier with an infusion of personnel,
fences and aircraft. While critics say that the buildup has merely
shifted the stream of illegal traffic from urban areas like San
Diego to more remote locations, officials say that they are gaining
the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   But some supporters of immigrants rights complain that
electronic deterrents are intrusive and not very neighborly. Some
question whether it is necessary to ``militarize'' a border shared
with a friendly nation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most sophisticated systems on the border is one at the
Otay Mesa crossing, a bustling port of entry on the outskirts of
this seaside city. Frequent commuters can avoid long car lines of
up to two hours by using what is called an automated driving lane.
It is the difference between traveling first class and suffering in
steerage.
</P>
<P>
   Cars in the program are equipped with transponders that emit a
sort of radio fingerprint. As a car approaches the border, the
license plate number, along with the names of the authorized
occupants and their photographs, appear on a monitor inside the
inspector's booth. Inspectors compare these images with the faces
inside the cars to see if there are any impostors.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning outside her booth into the car fumes on a recent
afternoon, Christine Aranita, an INS inspector, found people who
had shaved their beards or gained weight, but nothing out of the
ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   As drivers swiped an identity card through a machine, she asked
if they had brought anything with them from Mexico and, when told
no, wished them a good day. A few people chosen at random were
referred to the inspection area by the computer as a precaution
against smuggling, but most quickly continued on their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the other lanes, you have to check the immigration
documents and make sure that they actually belong to them because
we have a lot of fraud,'' Ms. Aranita said. ``The good thing about
the automated lane is that they've already gone through a
background check, so it's much faster. We already know who they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the automatic lane is to allow inspectors to
dispatch low-risk travelers quickly and spend more time with the
others. As it is, inspectors in the regular lanes typically spend
less than a minute to question each person and examine the person's
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Olga Gomez, one of 3,300 people authorized to use the automated
lane, was enthusiastic about the program. ``Waiting in line used to
be horrible'' when commuting between her home in San Diego and her
job at a furniture factory in Tijuana, Mexico, she said. Now she
crosses the border in about 40 seconds and thinks nothing of the
$129 annual fee to participate in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I pay that with a happy face,'' said Ms. Gomez,
who was having her fingerprints scanned by a computer in the port
office to renew her identity card.
</P>
<P>
   Some remote ports of entry along the Canadian border use other
kinds of technology that allow people to cross even after everyone
who works there has gone home for the day. At a crossing in Scobey,
Mont., for example, residents can speak into a microphone connected
to a computer that analyzes their voices and lets those it
recognizes pass.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast, there are several isolated border crossings
where inspectors can work via video camera from dozens of miles
away. Travelers must hold up their identity documents and sometimes
open their trunks for a camera so the images can be transmitted
back to inspectors watching live on a television screen.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras also play a role at Otay Mesa, where they scan the
license plate number of every passing car so a computer can check
it against those on a criminal lookout list. If the computer finds
a problem, it alerts the inspector with a loud beep.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Keeping reliable files on illegal aliens, who often use
fraudulent documents or carry no identification, is almost as easy.
Using digitized fingerprints, a computer system can determine
whether an alien has been caught before and is wanted by the
police.
</P>
<P>
   A Mexican woman who identified herself as Patricia was looking
especially glum as an inspector entered her fingerprints and
digital photograph into the database for the first time. She had
tried to fool inspectors by using someone else's United States
birth certificate and would now be deported and prohibited from
legally entering the country for five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before it was like, `Do I know you?' '' said Rick Perez, an
immigration agency supervisor at Otay Mesa. ``Unless you recognized
the person, you would never know whether they had been apprehended
before.''
</P>
<P>
   It used to be difficult enough just to determine whether someone
crossing the border was carrying an authentic green card or
crossing document. But the agency has recently started phasing in
cards that include holograms, magnetic stripes and digital
photographs, which make them more difficult to forge.
</P>
<P>
   Layered defense is also the theme in inspecting trucks, which
for years have been used to smuggle everything from Cuban cigars to
cocaine, from humans to puffer fish. If the sheer number of
different gadgets is any measure of official resolve to thwart
illegality, truckers should beware.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't rely on any one piece of technology,'' said Ray
Mintz, director of applied technology for the United States Customs
Service, which oversees vehicle inspections. ``Every truck, every
car, every container that comes in the country will run the gamut
of three or four different securities.''
</P>
<P>
   Those include X-ray machines that are big enough to drive a
truck through and fiber optic cameras that look into hard-to-reach
places like gas tanks. One instrument can determine whether the
liquid inside a glass jar may contain dissolved drugs. Another,
built into a lane in El Paso, alerts inspectors when a passing
truck is carrying radioactive material and indicates whether it
might be in a nuclear bomb or medical waste.
</P>
<P>
   Technologies like these are intended to make inspections faster
and more thorough. Searching by hand would require dismantling
truck walls, rifling through tons of cargo and, in many cases,
destroying the contents because narcotics are often embedded in
items like plaster statues and toilet bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Border authorities still use low-technology deterrents like dogs
to look for hidden drugs and money. Though often successful at
their job, dogs are somewhat limited in that they need frequent
breaks, are too small to get their noses into high places like
tractor-trailer ceilings and are incapable of sniffing inside
liquid-filled containers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to force the smugglers to more complicated and
expensive methods that may make them more vulnerable,'' Mintz said.
``I'm not trying to say that we will capture three times as much
drugs because, frankly, the smugglers will stop coming. They'll try
somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, faced with this ensemble of deterrents at the ports,
many would-be illegal immigrants and smugglers opt for what they
believe is an easier road, through the ravines and pastures along
the border fence. But these dirt paths are not always as primitive
as they may seem.
</P>
<P>
   That was clear one night as Carlos Vaca, a Border Patrol agent,
sat in his unmarked van on a hillside overlooking the frontier and
listened to a radio dispatcher announce the locations of buried
ground sensors that had detected movement.
</P>
<P>
   Every few minutes, he maneuvered a thermal scope, which can see
heat sources in the dark, in the direction of the sensor hits. All
that appeared in shades of green on his video monitor, though, was
a dog loping down a trail and a colleague's truck driving by.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, technology has also been used against the government.
Agents have found smugglers carrying night vision goggles and radio
scanners that, before encryption technology, could monitor law
enforcement radio traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we are going to have to stay one step ahead,'' said
Ron Collison, who heads the technology program for the INS. ``We're
using things that can be bought on the open market for the right
price.''
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm for electronic deterrents is not held by
everyone. Roberto Martinez, director of the border project of the
American Friends Service Committee, said that technologies like
cameras and ground sensors were creating an ``increasingly
militaristic frontier'' and ``making it more intrusive to U.S.
citizens and legal residents.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone agrees that technology is not the only answer to
protecting the border. Though electronics are proving to be
increasingly effective, Demetrios G. Papademetriou, co-director of
the migration policy program for the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, based in Washington, said that the equipment
was sometimes flawed and unequally distributed and had obviously
yet to stop the thousands of illegal migrants and tons of drugs
from flowing across the border each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology will help you, but it will not do the job for
you,'' Papademetriou said. ``You still need someone to go out and
pick up the illegal aliens and stop the smugglers.''

ELECTRONIC DOGS GUARD AIRPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It does not bark, wag its tail or scratch when sniffing for
drugs and explosives at the nation's airports and border crossings.
Rather, this device flashes a red light when it has detected
contraband and, on a display screen, tells what kind.
</P>
<P>
   Call them electronic dogs. These suitcase-size instruments are
increasingly being used to stop drug smugglers from entering the
country and terrorists from blowing up airplanes. They check for
prohibited materials without tiring, drooling or pawing at the
public.
</P>
<P>
   More properly called particle detectors or trace detectors,
these devices are perhaps best known from their use in airports.
They work on the principle that explosives, and the people who
handle them, leave traces of the stuff on much of what they come in
contact with.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word on the street was that canines were 100 times better
than the detectors,'' said Tony Fainberg, director of civilian
aviation policy for the Federal Aviation Administration. ``But now
we believe that the detectors are about equal, and in some cases,
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's detectors, which are set to search only for
explosives, are located inside airport terminals next to the X-ray
machines. To use the devices, security guards usually wipe the
handle of carry-on luggage with a piece of cloth to pick up
microscopic particles.
</P>
<P>
   The cloth is then placed inside the detector and heated to make
the particles that were absorbed turn to vapor. Within seconds, the
instrument can tell whether that vapor contains any traces of a
dangerous substance.
</P>
<P>
   Some detectors rely on a different method to operate: security
guards use a tiny vacuum cleaner to suck the air around baggage.
</P>
<P>
   According to Fainberg, trace detectors are generally sensitive
enough to detect nitroglycerin on the luggage of passengers who are
taking it in medication for heart conditions. Alerts have also been
triggered by military and police personnel who work in demolition.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, the FAA has installed 327 trace detectors at the
nation's airports. Fainberg said that the goal was to have
detectors at every terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for using this technology, he said, is that
explosives do not always show up on X-ray machines. He added that
while the FAA did still sometimes use dogs, the animals needed
frequent breaks, were not efficient in checking a large volume of
passengers and were considered by some to be intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the FAA has yet to find any actual bombs using the
detectors, said Rebecca Trexler, a spokeswoman for the agency.
Rather, she said the technology serves as a deterrent and is in
place just in case someone does try to smuggle explosives aboard a
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Other agencies like the Customs Service and the Coast Guard also
use particle detectors. But unlike the FAA agents, they search for
drugs as well as explosives, often by wiping steering wheels,
travel documents and door handles.
</P>
<P>
   Customs has had some modest success in detecting drugs with the
technology, according to Robert Armstrong, the agency's director of
research and development. However, he said that inspectors have yet
to find a bomb using a detector.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no technology can guarantee that contraband will be
found discovered every time, Armstrong said. Smugglers often try to
circumvent detection, he said, by wearing rubber gloves, packing
drugs in plastic, and not letting the person who carries the load
ever touch it directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is 100 percent,'' he said, and added that efforts at
evasion like wrapping illegal substances in thick plastic wrap
could make smugglers more vulnerable to other technologies, like
x-rays or send them searching for other routes.

HIGH-TECH HELP FOR FREQUENT TRAVELERS ENTERING U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<P>
   After a transcontinental flight to the United States, most
travelers want to grab their luggage and go to bed, not wait in
line at the airport. But wait they do, sometimes up to an hour as
Immigration and Naturalization Service inspectors check passports
and ask questions in their efforts to stop criminals and
unauthorized foreigners from entering the country.
</P>
<P>
   But now, by using what looks like a automated teller machine,
some travelers can be on their way in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   People enrolled in a program called the Immigration and
Naturalization Service Passenger Accelerated Service System, or
INS-PASS can avoid the bureaucracy by simply inserting an identity
card into the machine, placing a hand into an identity analyzer and
then, if all goes well, walking through an open gate.
</P>
<P>
   The program is open to frequent business travelers, who are
considered a low-risk group, from the United States and 28 other
designated low-risk countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the lines are so full,'' said Yoko Omae, a flight
attendant from Japan who was using the INS-PASS machine at the Los
Angeles International Airport recently after working on a flight
from Tokyo. ``During Christmas, New Year's and summer it takes an
hour to go through. This system is a great idea.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Ms. Omae only about 40 seconds to be allowed entry. The
computer examined a national database to find out if she was wanted
by the police and verified her identity using a relatively new
technique called hand geometrics.
</P>
<P>
   To prove that she was authorized to enter the United States, Ms.
Omae followed the instructions on a view screen to lay her right
hand inside a slot on the console. Within a few seconds, the
computer compared her hand with a sample she gave a year ago when
she enrolled in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Once cleared, she received a receipt from the computer, went to
pick up her luggage and walked past United States Agriculture and
Customs inspectors. If she had been rejected entry, either because
of a criminal alert or in error, a message would have appeared on
the screen telling her to wait in line to see an inspector.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 75,000 people have enrolled in INS-PASS. It is available
at an increasing number of airports, including Kennedy, Newark and
San Francisco International Airports. Applicants must generally
travel to the United States at least three times a year, submit to
an interview and undergo a computer background check that lasts a
few seconds before being issued a magnetic striped card bearing
their picture.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Graber, director of the INS operations at the Los Angeles
airport, said that the program allowed his inspectors to spend more
time trying to find passengers who are criminals or using
fraudulent documents. The way things are now, he said, inspectors
have an average of only 30 to 45 seconds to determine whether a
traveler should be allowed to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to do is move the low-risk passengers
through and take the inspectors we have and concentrate them on the
bad guys,'' Graber said.

DAVIS TRIMS SAILS ON SCHOOL REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Lawmakers and lobbyists listening to Gov.
Gray Davis lately are finding that several education policies he
was promoting during last year's campaign somehow have vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed policies were dropped or rewritten either because
of pressure from the powerful California Teachers Association, or
because of new laws signed during the campaign, a lack of money in
the state budget, or just common-sense advice from Davis' new
education advisers.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Davis said school districts should
reimburse colleges and universities for the cost of teaching basic
English and math to incoming students. Those students, he reasoned,
should have learned the subjects before they entered college. That
plan has vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Contracts should be required between parents and teachers, the
campaigning Davis said, to encourage more interest from home. But
in his State of the State address, Davis said he would ``urge''
school districts to require the contracts, which all school boards
have the option of installing.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, during the campaign, pledged to force the lowest
performing 10 percent of schools to create a partnership with a
community college or university to improve instruction. Now, Davis
wants community colleges to issue report cards on failing schools
and create reading-development partnerships with elementary and
secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
   And Davis' campaign idea to require a certain amount of homework
from students _ so specific that kindergartners were to be given 15
minutes of homework a night _ has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any reasonable person who becomes governor,'' said Kevin
Gordon, assistant executive director of the California School
Boards Association, ``looks at how pragmatic some of the ideas were
on the campaign trail, and also how they were received, and then
decides what to disregard and what to go with.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, school lobbyists and Democratic lawmakers have
embraced Davis' comprehensive education package, which includes
increased teacher training, tougher graduation requirements, more
reading programs and more scrutiny of failing schools.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have been impressed with the task force Davis
appointed, after taking office earlier this month, to look at
proposals to overhaul public education. They also are impressed
with the appointment of former state Sen. Gary Hart, an education
reformer for many years, as the new education secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The Davis administration said some of the reforms had been
delayed because of money problems. The state faces a $2.3 billion
deficit, which has forced Davis to cut back on his ambitious $3
billion program to buy new textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has called a special session of the Legislature to tackle
his education program. Davis spokesman Michael Bustamante said
voters should expect more from the new governor, including,
perhaps, some of the reforms that appeared to have vanished after
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only about three minutes into the first quarter,''
Bustamante said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans worry that Davis is too quickly succumbing to
pressure from the California Teachers Association, a major Davis
campaign contributor, particularly when it comes to the ability of
school districts to fire teachers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail and even in his inaugural address, Davis
was tough on teachers, saying: ``They will get better, or they will
be encouraged to find another line of work.'' But in his State of
the State address, Davis said he wanted a system in which a teacher
was reviewed by a more experienced colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the teacher receives an unfavorable review,'' Davis said,
``he or she will be given an opportunity to improve. But if there's
no improvement after an appropriate period of time, the results ...
will be conveyed to the local school board.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not enough for Assembly Republican Leader Rod Pacheco of
Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned,'' Pacheco said, ``if you're talking about
broken promises, about his apparent retreat on accountability. He
said we are going to crack down on teachers and principals who are
incompetent.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Davis' campaign promises may have been jettisoned
because they just didn't seem logical.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that failing school districts should pay the California
State University system for educating incoming students with poor
English and math scores has two problems.
</P>
<P>
   It's the California State system, after all, that trains the
vast majority of California teachers. If they are producing
teachers who are producing failing students, then why should the
CSU system be reimbursed for their failures? And making failing
school districts pay more money from their already thin budgets
seems counter-productive.
</P>
<P>
   The Davis homework requirement, lawmakers say, may have suffered
from overkill. School districts constantly complain about state
mandates, preferring block-grant checks from Sacramento instead of
one-size-fits-all laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a certain point, we do need to draw the line between state
mandates and local control,'' said Assembly Education Committee
Chairwoman Kerry Mazzoni, D-San Rafael. ``I would really hesitate
to see the state micro-manage that much.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, Davis' proposed education reforms on the campaign
trail were already being discussed in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail Davis demanded an end to ``social
promotion,'' the practice of advancing students a grade level even
though they are failing. There wasn't a single word about social
promotion in Davis' education-laden State of the State address.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps for good reason: Former Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican,
signed a measure last year that requires students to meet minimum
academic requirements before they can move up to the next grade.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has not abandoned student accountability. The new governor
is proposing a rigorous state-mandated test in order to graduate
from high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not shied away from student responsibility,'' Gordon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gordon said he had noticed a subtle change in Davis'
rhetoric as soon as he was sworn in. Davis listed many proposals
during his inaugural address but offered this caveat up front:
``What matters is whether the idea is right or wrong _ and whether
it will work.''

<P>
   To be an aspiring screenwriter today without knowing a soul in
Hollywood is like trying to tackle Mount Everest without training,
supplies or guides. Writing is the easy part. Ascending the peak
means selling the script. To do that, the writer needs an agent or
manager to shepherd the script to Hollywood producers and studio
executives. There's a Catch-22: reading unsolicited material is
verboten for those same agents and managers. The same goes for
producers and studio executives.
</P>
<P>
   What's a writer to do?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, send the script to Francis Ford Coppola.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Coppola, the director of arguably some of the best
movies ever made _ ``The Godfather'' and its sequels, as well as as
``Apocalypse Now'' and ``The Rainmaker'' _ began accepting
speculative screenplay submissions for his production company,
American Zoetrope, through its Web site  &UR; (www.zoetrope.com) &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already identified a few screenplays that are really
superior,'' Coppola said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Web has become a virtual Schwab's drugstore for
screenwriters, offering sites where they can post their work and
hope to be discovered. The Zoetrope site is designed as a free-form
screenwriter's workshop. That is the cost of access to American
Zoetrope and to Coppola, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   For a screenplay to be considered by Zoetrope, a writer must
read and evaluate four screenplays submitted by other writers to
the site. The evaluations are then read by Zoetrope employees, and
the best scripts are catapulted into the Zoetrope system for
consideration for purchase. There is also a chat site and
individual pages for writers to post their biographies. Discussion
has been brisk, and Coppola said he was pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, when you're accepting all comers, it's the one out
of a thousand that's going to be that diamond,'' Coppola said.
``How unorthodox, on the other hand, to get your work read by
people who could make it into a film.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppola said he was not only looking for material but was also
hoping to identify superior writers who had been unable to
penetrate the Hollywood system. He predicted that studios and
production companies would follow his lead soon.
</P>
<P>
   The revolution already has begun for Chuck Ivie, a 62-year-old
retired NASA scientist. He said always he had loved to write and
had even published articles in the journals Astrophysical Review
and Icarus.
</P>
<P>
   Ivie posted his screenplay on  &UR; www &LR;   &UR; .writerswebsite.com &LR; , a
site for screenwriters. An independent producer took an option on
the script. This means the producer has, for a limited time, the
exclusive rights to make the movie. In November, Ivie attended a
casting session for a trailer for the film. In the independent film
world, a trailer is used to sell the movie to potential investors.
At the casting session, Ivie, a man who helped design the first
United States satellite, was welcomed as ``the screenwriter.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a popular Hollywood aphorism (and Coppola, too),
there are 60 screenwriters writing all the movies in Hollywood
today. The numbers tend to bear this out: the Writers Guild of
America, the union for Hollywood screenwriters, has about 11,000
members. In a typical year, 50 percent work in film and television,
earning an average of $80,000 each. But only 5 percent of guild
members earn $300,000 a year or more from writing, said Chuck
Slocum, director of special projects at the guild. The low end of a
working Hollywood screenwriter's annual salary, he said, is in the
low six figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a better chance of winning the California lottery
than getting a Hollywood movie made,'' said Colin Chapman, an
aspiring screenwriter. Chapman, 34, a former political consultant
and Web developer in Falls Church, Va., has never been to
Hollywood. He tried getting attention for his four screenplays by
mailing 200 query letters to literary agents and production
companies. Only three companies responded. No one took the bait.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman then decided to publish his screenplay on his own Web
site. Within weeks of the posting, among the hundreds of responses,
he received five e-mail messages from people who described
themselves as producers or directors.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was a Canadian commercial director, Donovan Boden,
looking for a project that would allow him to break into feature
films. Boden introduced Chapman to his talent agent, Sanjay Burman,
a packaging agent at the Characters Talent Agency in Toronto, who
signed Chapman as a client. The agency then gave the script to
another client, the actor Yaphet Kotto, who plays Giardello on
``Homicide.'' Burman said Kotto liked the script and was waiting
for a rewrite before attaching himself to the project.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman said that there was no good reason not to publish on the
Web and ``1,000 reasons to do it.'' ``You get a chance of getting
discovered that you're not going to get anywhere else,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood insiders are not so sanguine about the Web's value as
a talent scout. Cheryl Stanley, vice president for creative affairs
at More-Medavoy Management, which represents writers, said she and
her colleagues did not have time to search the Web. But she did
acknowledge that someone could be discovered that way. ``Miracles
do happen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the posting of screenplays, Ms. Stanley said: ``I
wouldn't recommend it for anyone who's working under the system or
even close to the outside. The reason we do business this way is to
protect our writers, to make sure that they get paid for what makes
them special and unique, and that's their ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Edgar, Webmaster of the Zoetrope site, acknowledged that
there was some risk of theft but said it was far outweighed by the
benefits the site offered. Writers who submit scripts to Zoetrope
with ideas they think are easy to steal can list them on the site's
``anti-rip-off registry.'' When the company makes films, it will
search the registry for similar scripts. Should it find any, Edgar
said, Zoetrope will ``attempt to come to an appropriate agreement''
with the writer.

   NEW YORK _ Among the sleek seals swimming through Christie's New
York last Thursday, with their fur coats, thin watches, Italian
loafers and winter tans, appeared John Gordon, wrapped in a wool
scarf, wearing suede bucks and an imitation beaver-skin coat _ like
a piece of folk Americana miscatalogd in a European sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fake,'' he said of his coat, as if to establish his
credibility quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, 72, a preeminent folk Americana dealer who retired eight
years ago, was at the auction house to observe the installation of
the 1,352 lots of his own collection, an important view of an
unusual field, being offered Thursday and on Tuesday. The estimate
for the sale is $1.3 million to $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has been buying, selling and more than occasionally
keeping non-Native American, nonacademic American arts and crafts,
or folk Americana, for 50 years: whirligigs, rattles, rugs,
pottery, paintings, sculpture, furniture and other items.
</P>
<P>
   There are 38 weather vanes in the sale. ``In Europe's Catholic
countries, it's invariably a rooster,'' he said. ``Association with
Christ. The day the cock crowed. Here, name a subject, you've got
it in a weather vane: peacocks, locomotives. I've got a cow jumping
over the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has watched the market for folk Americana make the same
surprising leap from an eccentric, undervalued taste, restricted to
a few rich collectors like Henry duPont and Dr. Alfred Barnes, to a
star-powered, crowd-pleasing auction commodity. Gordon has sold
items to the Rockefellers and Andy Warhol. Since buying his first
piece, a $3 pie plate, as an art student in his 20s, he has set
records, including the $26,500 he paid in 1977 for a Shaker trestle
table, since resold.
</P>
<P>
   After a disastrous crash in the late 1980s, much like that for
contemporary art, the market for folk Americana has made a steady
march back to health, in part because of the interest in outsider
art, which is drawing new excitement to the field. Sotheby's
Americana sale Saturday and Sunday includes 57 lots of outsider
art. Gordon's collection has several examples, including two
drawings by Bill Traylor.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, Gordon and his wife, Leah, have lived over
the years in a New York apartment and two houses in Massachusetts
with an expanding body of impressive bric-a-brac that now _ 10
truckloads later _ sits at Christie's. ``You're not going to find
my bed here, but they do have my chest of drawers,'' he said,
gesturing to a scrolled-foot, yellow-painted piece with a flowered
front. Not a problem. ``My wife hated it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to believe that Gordon understands his visiting
privileges will end. He lifted an 18th-century Windsor chair off a
podium to sit on while talking, and offered a figured maple Queen
Anne as though he were at home and not in a room being set up for a
preview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nine spindles,'' he said of the Windsor's fanned back,
``which is scarce. It reflects the work of a master craftsman.
Normally, there are seven or less.'' Gordon settled in. ``The
American Windsor is a marvel of comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   He sat with a carved gray gull in his lap, its head nested back
on its wing as though Gordon had lulled it to sleep by stroking the
wood. He held the gull to his nose. ``It's camphor wood, so we know
the wood came from China,'' he said, holding it out. The air
suddenly smelled as though someone had opened a spice box. ``It was
made as a cap for a masthead, as luck for the sailors.''
</P>
<P>
   As a young collector, Gordon began dealing on the side. Later,
as a dealer, he began collecting on the side. Hattie Brunner, a
pioneer Pennsylvania Dutch folk Americana dealer and one of
Gordon's mentors, told him that being close to something was the
only way to learn about it. So Gordon told his wife that they would
keep what they liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-five years ago, you couldn't sell the stuff,'' he said.
``You couldn't mark it up more than 5 percent. Rather than quit the
business, I started selecting things for us to live with and to
enjoy.'' It improved Gordon's game.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon had witnessed the lesson as a young man, at the hand of
another mentor, Barnes. ``He began, in his house, associating
pieces from the Pennsylvania Dutch country with work by major
artists,'' Gordon said, ``placing dower chests under paintings by
Renoir. It proved art from any culture, any time, could have
value.'' Years later, Gordon repeated the experiment himself,
taking an Andy Warhol ``Marilyn'' painting on approval in exchange
for the balance on a bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hung it in my living room with an Edward Hicks,'' Gordon
said, referring to the artist discovered and made famous as folk
Americana. ``You know what? It held up.'' It hangs in Gordon's
newly empty bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though now part of the canon of collecting, folk Americana has
been a hard sell and a subject of controversy. The largely
anonymous material has lived by its wits and its charm, the
suppositions of scholarship and the attributions of the market, not
by the sureties of dated signatures that verify other genres of
art.
</P>
<P>
   There are 21 attributions in the John Gordon collection, in
addition to many items described as probably or possibly by various
artists, schools or of various regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can say who it's by, you can charge more for it,'' said
Jack Lindsey, curator of American decorative art at the
Philadelphia Museum of Art. Lindsey was asked by Christie's to
comment on the Pennsylvania Germanic pottery, a feature of Gordon's
collection. The ``fugitive nature of proof,'' he said, haunts the
category of folk Americana.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, it has stayed popular with a public that responds
to both its nostalgia and its patriotism. Much of Gordon's force as
a dealer has been in mapping America as an uncollected, uncharted
country. As a collector, Gordon formed an idiosyncratic view of his
subject _ the subject itself was idiosyncratic: face vessels,
walking sticks, rummers, flags constructed from pop-tops. He
collected 18th-, 19th- and 20th-century examples, using his own eye
as much as provenance or scarcity.
</P>
<P>
   Paul D'Ambrosio, the chief curator of the New York State
Historical Association at Cooperstown, said he thought that range
was the strength of Gordon's vision. ``Very few people collect both
19th and 20th century,'' he said. ``There's a lot to be gained by
seeing the two together.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Pennington, editor of Maine Antique Digest, said the
broadness of the mixture worked against the collection's interest.
``There are some great things, some not great things in there,''
Pennington said. ``Any time you have a sale of a dealer's
collections, it's going to be a big mixed bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Have there been wild goose chases? Not to hear Gordon tell it.
There was the dower chest, one of five in the sale, that he bought
from a man named Smitty, a funeral director and postman in
Pennsylvania, who didn't easily let Gordon into his house and
thought the chest was French. Gordon recognized the stencils as the
work of Moses Eaton Jr., one of the most-renowned 19th-century New
England decorators.
</P>
<P>
   There was the weather vane he had to copy for the firemen to get
the rare original off the firehouse roof. There was the widow he
drank tea with until three in the morning to get her late husband's
pair of John Brewster Jr. paintings. ``I think she got tired,''
Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   In conversation, Gordon digresses like the county roads that
have revealed treasure for him. Where will the road take the
ex-collector next, now that America has been discovered and
consigned? ``Here's a secret,'' he said. ``I collect other things:
Japanese prints, School of Paris paintings, German Expressionist
prints.''
</P>
<P>
   Having an empty house might mean the chance to fill it. ``Who
knows if I won't see a piece and go nuts over it?'' Gordon said.
</P>

NEXT, THE DRINK 'N' READ
</HEADLINE>

By KARRIE JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Have you seen them?'' asked Carole Baron, the president and
publisher of Dell Publishing and Delacorte Press. ``They're cute.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed they are. Cute was exactly the word that came to mind
when I first set eyes on the six little books that, beginning in
February, will be distributed on supermarket shelves, tucked inside
some 40 million 12- and 24-packs of Diet Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Four inches by six inches, roughly 30 pages thick, these
excerpts of forthcoming works by best-selling authors are adorable.
They boast the cover designs of full-size hardbacks scaled down to
resemble those Joe Bonomo booklets that used to be sold at the
checkout counter, the ones with titles like ``How to Develop a New
Personality for a More Vibrant and Magnetic You.''
</P>
<P>
   Except these are the products of major publishing houses:
HarperCollins, Penguin Putnam, Doubleday.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale behind this unorthodox promotion is abstract. As
Diana Garza, a Coca-Cola spokeswoman, put it, the company made a
``concerted effort to get to know the consumer on a deeper level.''
Researchers discovered that typical Diet Coke drinkers have inner
lives and that they especially like to read. So, in the words of a
news release, the company decided to ``provide Diet Coke consumers
with a medium for enjoying the simple pleasure of drinking a Diet
Coke and curling up with a good book.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola approached a number of publishers, who drew up lists
of popular titles that would be released in the first months of
this year. No money traded hands. The publishers embraced the joint
venture because it represented vast quantities of free advertising.
What Coke gets out of it is, perhaps, a momentary advantage over
Pepsi. The deal, as they say, is win-win.
</P>
<P>
   But it can't be good for the increasingly shaky status of the
book as a bedrock cultural artifact. While predictions of
extinction may be far-fetched, the book is a less definite object
than it once was.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Rocket eBook, for example, the paperback-size
electronic device that can hold 4,000 pages of text and that
recently had its debut in, of all places, the Levenger catalog
(``Tools for Serious Readers''). Offered for sale amid the halogen
lamps and the fancy paper clips, the $500 gadget allows one to
download books _ or, rather, the contents of books _ from the
Barnes &AMP; Noble Web site. If Coca-Cola made the book cute, the
Rocket eBook has made it downright insubstantial.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, what's disturbing about the Diet Coke promotion is not
that it seems wrong. It's that it seems exactly right. Walk into a
Barnes &AMP; Noble superstore and you'll notice that the long wall of
new releases, the book jackets facing outward, could just as easily
be the cereal aisle of your supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   And the books Coca-Cola selected are not great works of
literature but rather the written equivalent of soda pop. Three of
the selections are Maeve Binchy's ``Tara Road,'' Nora Roberts'
``River's End'' and Barbara Taylor Bradford's ``A Sudden Change of
Heart.'' (``We hate to call them romance novels,'' Ms. Garza said
of the genre.) One book, ``Mistaken Identity,'' is a thriller by
Lisa Scottoline _ ``the female John Grisham,'' according to the
book jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Soup for the Couple's Soul,'' complete with blurbs
from Marie Osmond and Deepak Chopra, is, of course, another in the
best-selling series of saccharine (or Aspartame-sweetened)
inspirational tales. They will be right at home in the soft drink
section, where they will be depicted on the cardboard Coke cartons
above the words ``Collect All Six.''
</P>
<P>
   The standout is an Elmore Leonard novel. With its brash cover
design _ a harshly cropped photograph of a tough-girl face and type
that looks as if it were rubbed with sandpaper _ it is the one book
of the batch that does not look like supermarket fare. It was
designed by Chip Kidd, the award-winning art director, who, over
the course of a decade, has revamped the visual language of book
jackets. Kidd jokes that the Leonard novel was picked by Coke for
its title: ``Be Cool.''
</P>

   When asked how he feels about having a book he designed
distributed like a Cracker Jack prize, Kidd said he didn't mind.
``I don't think it's a bad thing, if it's a good book and a good
jacket,'' he said. ``Let's face it, books are products for a mass
market.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the sanguine Kidd believes in limits. ``If Knopf
started advertising Dr Pepper on the back of our books,'' he said,
``that would be the decline of Western civilization.''

   As William Shakespeare observed in ``As You Like It,'' all the
world's a stage _ but these days it helps to have some idea of
exactly where to find the good stuff. The American Theater Web
(www.americantheaterweb.com) is helping to do just that, providing
links and listings in one convenient place for over 1,000 theaters
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The site's eventual goal is to list as many Web sites from
American non-profit performing arts groups as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Web surfers in the mood for a little drama can search for
playhouses by either an alphabetical listing of theater names or by
city and state. For each entry on the site, there is a summary of
the theater company's work and productions, along with a link to
that theater's own Web site for more detailed information.
</P>
<P>
   The range of organizations found on the site is impressive _
everything from small community theaters in Utah to the famed Arena
Stage in Washington. Although the big commercial houses of Broadway
are not on the site, links to several dozen non-profit drama
companies in New York City are listed.
</P>
<P>
   The American Theater Web, which now averages 175 hits a day,
went on line last fall and has been growing steadily. The site's
creators are constantly on the lookout for new links, and one or
two theaters a week have been sending in the URLs for their home
pages for inclusion on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Using keywords, the American Theater Web site can be searched to
the surfer's own tastes. The site also has monthly groupings of
shows going up nationwide, and many theaters also list all their
productions for the current season. A message board for theater
professionals and other interested parties to exchange notes, ideas
and information is also a popular area of the site.
</P>
<P>
   The American Theater Web was created as a non-profit venture,
but its creator, Andrew Propst, said he was looking for a corporate
sponsor to help enhance it. ``Should this sponsorship be gained,''
he wrote by e-mail, ``the first expansion that we would like to
have take place is the creation of a server where smaller theaters
can place their Web pages.''
</P>
<P>
   Many smaller theaters use free Web space on America Online or
Geocities, but the Web addresses tend to get a bit unmemorable and
unwieldy. ``A URL of `http://americantheaterweb.com/publictheater,'
provided free of charge, we believe would be much more valuable for
the theater as it attempts to reach new audiences through the
Web,'' Propst said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the site is offering to design Web pages, at no charge,
for a limited number of non-profit theaters that need them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the sponsorship search continues, the site is growing and
adding new features. In addition to more theaters submitting their
Web addresses for inclusion, the American Theater Web has a new
section called ``American Theater in the News'' devoted to feature
articles and reviews of productions from newspapers with online
sites, as well as stories of general interest to theatergoers.
</P>
<P>
   With this site, all the Web's a stage. And if by any chance your
appetite has now been whetted for a performance of ``As You Like
It,'' the site lists upcoming versions of the popular Elizabethan
comedy, including the Alabama Shakespeare's Festival's production
running from March 9 to July 25, 1999.

GRAVES' PROGRESS FROM PAPER VISIONS TO GIANT TEAKETTLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With GRAVES-TARGET) 
(js) 
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At last, there is reason to hope that the Whitney Museum of
American Art may be casting off its reputation for trendiness. In
what may be seen, fairly or not, as a defining moment in the early
tenure of the Whitney's new director, Maxwell Anderson, the museum
has rented its premises next Tuesday evening for the unveiling of a
new line of houseware accessories and furniture designed for Target
stores by the American architect Michael Graves.
</P>
<P>
   Few architects today are less trendy than Graves. In the early
1980s, he was a trend beyond compare, an architect who designed
shopping bags for Bloomingdale's, a trophy cup for the style awards
presented by GQ magazine, a Fifth Avenue boutique for Diane Von
Furstenberg. Today, he is regarded by many as a stale trend:
yesterday's bag. And in these fast-paced times, a stale trend is
virtually ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Graves' appearance at the Whitney has the aura of an
archeological excavation. As the historically minded may recall,
Graves is the architect who designed an addition to the Whitney
Museum in 1985. The overbearing composition, a neo-classical
ziggurat that reduced Marcel Breuer's building to a black
cornerstone, roused wide public opposition, was twice revised and
was eventually abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The outcry belied the conventional wisdom that controversy
boosts an artist's career. Though Graves has continued to prosper
as a builder, in the last 15 years his work has largely fallen off
the map of critical appreciation. This may be partly attributed to
a fickle press, which creates stars and then contrives to dim their
luster. But it's also true that his later work did not live up to
the promise of his early vision.
</P>
<P>
   The architect made his first reputation in the late 1970s with a
series of drawings on yellow tracing paper, which offered a
powerful new vision of urban America in the late 20th century. The
Fargo-Moorehead Cultural Center Bridge project, designed in 1977,
remains a powerful image of its time, although the design was never
executed.. But it also suggested that the post-modern movement was
creatively inspired, not the reactionary force it would become.
</P>
<P>
   It was with mounting disappointment, therefore, that some of
Graves' admirers acknowledged the awful truth disclosed by his
progression into full-scale building: the quality of his drawings
did not translate into architecture. Some fundamental talent for
space-making was glaringly absent and could not be concealed by the
swags, festoons, urns and other devices on which the architect
increasingly came to depend.
</P>
<P>
   Graves has written of his childhood encounters with Paul Cret's
neo-classical civic buildings in his native Midwest, and what
continues to be winning about his drawings is that they offer a
child's garden of classicism, immense, imposing buildings viewed
from the perspective of a child going off to explore the terrors
and wonders of the American downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Graves' drawings for the Portland Building, his first major
public commission, were wonderfully young-eyed, but when the
project was completed in 1982, it became painfully clear that this
quality had not survived the translation from drawing to building.
Nor was there any compensation in the imaginative use of space. The
result resembled some grotesque, architectural version of Alice
after she telescopes out into the giant of Wonderland.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland Building could be defended as a young architect's
learning experience, if an immensely conspicuous and expensive one.
But subsequent projects only confirmed that the strength of Graves'
vision relied on the essentially graphic virtues of architectural
drawings: the tentativeness of line, the atmospheric use of color
and, yes, even the background tone, at once sunny and mournful, of
the tracing paper.
</P>
<P>
   As Graves' celebrity ballooned, so did the extravagant claims he
made for his architecture. In one essay, he said he was restoring
the connection between mankind and landscape allegedly shattered by
the modern movement. Those traveling to La Jolla, Calif., can see
for themselves the absurdity of this notion. At the Salk Institute,
Louis I. Kahn, a modern architect, created one of the most sublime
landscapes in the world. A few miles up the road squats the
Aventine, a mixed-use development that Graves designed in 1985. The
buildings occupy the land with less sensitivity than the highway
that glides serenely past them.
</P>
<P>
   The pleasant surprise is that Graves' designs for Target stores
reverse the disenchantment with his architecture. At first, the
idea of them seemed like a bad memory. The '80s rise again! More
architect's baubles! But this resistance swiftly melts, because the
objects have such pleasingly cheap charm. They are not great design
on the level of work by Ettore Sottsass, Philippe Starck or Shiro
Kuramata. Nor are they uniformly elegant. But they do possess the
childish quality that has animated Graves' drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Enlargement of scale works to the designer's advantage here.
Graves' teakettle is large enough to boil lobsters in. His
two-slice toaster looks big enough to mix, knead and bake two small
loaves of bread. At a time when design is dominated by an
increasing trend toward miniaturization, these bloated objects are
comically perverse.
</P>
<P>
   The Target designs also illuminate an underlying philosophical
contradiction that has weakened many of Graves' buildings. Like
other post-modernists, he imagines himself a classicist, but the
infantile strain in his work places him firmly in the romantic
tradition. Deliberate regression, to use Robert Harbison's phrase,
is a hallmark of the romantic movement, and so is the craving for
novelty that the Target products are clearly designed to satisfy.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing unsound with being a romantic classicist _ it's
a style of distinguished historical pedigree. And the tension
between Graves' classical ambitions and his romantic sensibility
could be a source of strength if he allowed his sensibility freer
reign. As he evidently did in unearthing these playful artifacts
from within his richly fertile mind.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like extremely rare gilt side chairs and exceptional
Louis XV what's-its, the late decorator Mark Hampton was a fixture
at the Winter Antiques Show. He could invariably be spotted at the
cavernous entrance to the Seventh Regiment Armory, one prestigious
client or another hanging on both his words and his pinstriped
Savile Row suits with twin vents.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who died at 58 in July, was known for his erudition as
well as an A-list of clients that included George and Barbara Bush,
Anne Bass, Carter and Susan Burden and Pamela Harriman. He left
behind his wife, Duane, two daughters, Alexa, 27, and Kate, 30, and
hundreds of watercolors of interiors, including those of his own
design, some 40 of which will be on display in his stead at the
show, opening Friday. Later this month, there will be a tribute to
Hampton at Blair House, which he redecorated with Mario Buatta, and
a second show of watercolors will open at the New York School of
Interior Design on April 8.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's passion for painting _ especially while on the
telephone _ was such that his beer would sometimes turn blue from
the paintbrush he dipped absent-mindedly in the wrong glass. He was
constantly sketching, and the walls of the family's Park Avenue
apartment are filled with archly rendered watercolors: Duane as
Venus on the half shell in workout clothes; Kate dancing
Astaire-style with her father, his bald spot in full bloom.
</P>
<P>
   This week, as the watercolors of idealized interiors were being
bubble-wrapped, Hampton's widow and daughters gathered on the
18th-century four-poster bed found for them by their friend the
duchess of Marlborough and remembered Hampton, periodically
resorting to balled-up Kleenex. Though their loss was still fresh,
the subject at hand was the news that Alexa, who worked with her
father from the time she was in high school, is taking over the
creative reins of Mark Hampton Inc. Although Duane technically owns
the firm and will be its ``figurehead,'' as she put it, Alexa will
forge its path.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible legacy, and a great comfort to keep Daddy's
memory going,'' Ms. Hampton said, her gravelly voice betraying
tobacco. ``We've been doing this forever, but we've lost our
mentor.'' She paused. ``I realize I'll be judged by his standards,
possibly unfavorably.''
</P>
<P>
   His standards were legendary, even within the fussy sphere of
decorating. Two days before he died, Ms. Hampton visited him in the
hospital, carrying a legal pad, blueprints and drawings of
moldings. He corrected their shape in shaky scrawl and expressed
dismay that she'd brought a pencil instead of a pen.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ms. Hampton worked side by side with her father, she has
a delicate balancing act ahead, as she aims both to keep her
father's lifelong clients and to reposition the firm for a younger
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alexa has been grooming herself,'' said Alan Tanksley, 39, a
Manhattan decorator and family friend, who worked at the firm in
the 1980s. ``She admired her father's passion and style and has
emulated that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who was best known for an understated traditionalism,
was a native of Plainfield, Ind., but seemed a lifelong citizen of
style. He dated his own career from the moment when, at 13, he
precociously refinished the walnut shutters of his bedroom. In a
eulogy, his Michigan law school roommate, Charles Eisendraft,
recalled his shock at first entering their dorm room to ``a huge
splay of freshly cut rhododendron,'' three porphyry obelisks and
``little boxes all over the place, not one of them containing
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Like her father, who abandoned law school to study art history,
Ms. Hampton studied at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York
University (apres Spence and Brown). Her under-600-square-foot
apartment, substantially smaller than the family manse in
Southampton, was featured in Elle Decor in the fall. Her father
would sooner have lived with his back to the window than use bamboo
blinds from Manhattan Shade and Glass (``I couldn't afford
curtains''), and would never have displayed ``a Lucite cube I
begged Gracious Home to sell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of her strategy will be to go after the moneyed children of
her father's clients _ young people not so unlike herself, a young
woman who spent her 16th birthday with her father at the Prado.
Among her current projects are the downtown loft of Carter Burden
Jr. and his wife, Charmaine, and Belle Burden's apartment on the
Upper East Side. ``A lot of younger people love what our parents
had but maybe don't want to be so traditional,'' Ms. Hampton
explained. ``It took years for our parents to know what they
wanted. We have fewer layers, and we're less wedded to being
rigorously partial to one particular period.''
</P>
<P>
   With her friends, she is often ``an anti-decorator decorator,''
she said, adding: ``I sometimes tell them: `Don't do it _ buy it
later. How much money do you want to invest in a look when you're
only 27?' '' She seems to resist decorating the apartment of her
sister, Kate, an actress off-Broadway. ``She's insisting that the
particleboard has to stay,'' she said with brow-furrowing
disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   In the often catty world of decorating, where rumors sprout
whiskers, the entry of a younger Hampton into the business is being
greeted with some degree of skepticism, though many wish her luck.
``Is she going to Kennebunkport to plan the future of the Bush
empire?'' said a publicity agent in the decorating business, who
insisted on anonymity. ``You don't get there by reading history
books.''
</P>
<P>
   While her mother retains the links with the old guard _ jetting
off to visit long-term clients ``whose hands need to be held,'' in
Tanksley's words _ all three Hampton women (Kate works a day job in
the office) are keenly aware of Hampton's mystique, ``assessing how
to place themselves as a newly formed design entity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's an emotionally tricky task. ``I have no interest in defying
his style,'' Alexa said of her father, whom she more than
fleetingly resembles. ``I think he was, and is, a genius.''
</P>
<P>
   At Hickory Chair, for whom Hampton designed a West Indian
rope-turned bed and other historically based furniture, Hampton
style will continue to be sold. His archive, said Jay Reardon, the
company's president, ``is like having a portfolio of mutual funds:
we'll keep reaching in and pulling out what's great.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But longtime Hampton watchers point out that decorating has its
own peculiar rules, ones that, in the stratosphere Hampton operated
in, are often dominated not just by a look but by winey lunches and
crystalline dinner repartee. ``If you're used to going to Mark
Hampton, have spent millions, and you buy a third house, do you go
back to the firm?'' asked Louise Grunwald, a family friend who took
her own business to Parish-Hadley and used to own an antiques shop
with Duane Hampton. ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hampton now faces her own blank canvas, brush in hand. For
now, she seems to have an ally in the economy. ``The timing is on
her side,'' said Arie L. Kopelman, chairman of the Winter Antiques
Show and president of Chanel, who became a client of Mark Hampton's
26 years ago. ``He was the rainmaker. But there are a lot of young
people out there with money.''
</P>
<P>
   In conversation, Ms. Hampton comes across as spunky, fiercely
determined and possessive of her father's memory. ``Mark was
certainly preparing her, but she's up against the entire design
world,'' said Paige Rense, editor in chief of Architectural Digest.
``Her problem is obvious: is she talented and strong enough to
handle the kind of clients he had, or will they turn to a brand
name? A personal relationship only goes so far, and chemistry is as
important as talent. My feeling is, she'll make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nan Kempner, a longtime client of Mark Hampton, who has hired
Ms. Hampton to ``freshen up the Kempner Hotel,'' as she called her
Park Avenue apartment, said: ``She has a lot of guts. She's not
just name alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton would probably approve of his daughter's direction. He
knew that many saw decorating as frivolous, but ``to transform the
bleak and the barren into welcoming places where one can live,'' he
wrote, ``seems to me an important and worthwhile goal in life.''
</P>
<P>
   The legacy Ms. Hampton inherits is present in the watercolors
now hanging, bittersweetly, in the Armory. In her father's hands,
life's moments were enchanted chapters to be illustrated. They
burst from the 51 leatherbound scrapbooks in the bedroom containing
family snapshots and triumphal newspaper clippings. Volume 52 waits
to be filled.

   Blooming Pips
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have heard that it is possible to force lily of the valley
to bloom indoors in the winter. I have them in my garden, and I
wonder _ can I just dig them up and bring them inside or is there
more to it than that?
</P>
<P>
   A. More, but not a great deal. Dig and lift the
lily-of-the-valley rhizome and cut pieces about as large as a thick
finger, making sure that each piece contains a distinct bud, or
eye. Those pieces are called pips.
</P>
<P>
   To grow and bloom, these pips, unlike the Pips that backed up
Gladys Knight, need to go through a cooling period of eight weeks
at soil temperatures no warmer than 45 degrees. They should be
wrapped in barely moist peat moss, put in a plastic bag and placed
in the coldest part of your refrigerator _ low and in back, near
those forgotten leftovers. Some bulbs and rhizomes can have their
flowering inhibited by ethylene gas, so you may want to first eat
all your apples, pears, cantaloupes and tomatoes, which produce
this gas. Maybe blend them into a peculiar but very healthy drink.
</P>
<P>
   Since lily of the valley does well in low light, the pips can be
potted up just below the surface in a rich, well-drained medium and
put near any window in the house, once they have been through the
cooling period. They'll bloom in about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to save your refrigerator for food, you can try to
guess when the ground is going to freeze. Since the pips don't care
where they get their cooling, you can wait until the last minute to
dig them. As long as the soil temperature stays below 45 degrees,
the time counts toward the eight weeks. If you miss your guess and
the ground freezes solid, you can still enjoy the flowers next
spring, right there in your garden.
</P>
<P>
   Hold On Tight
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why is it that many oak trees keep their leaves through most
of the winter even though the leaves are dead? They seem to shed
the leaves little by little, so that they have to be raked several
times. Are there other deciduous trees that do this?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This is one of those interesting little phenomena that
apparently are not interesting enough to have prompted a definitive
scientific study. Beeches and chestnuts also hold on to their
leaves, and are in the same family as oaks, the Fagaceae.
</P>
<P>
   What is known is that young trees, and young branches that
sprout from old stumps, seem to hold on to their leaves longer than
mature trees do.
</P>
<P>
   Why they hold on is a mystery, but there are at least two
possibilities as to how they do it. When fall comes, deciduous
plants move all of the carbohydrates from their leaves back into
their woody parts _ trunk, branches and roots. A hard tissue called
the abscission layer is then formed at the point where the leaf
stalk meets the stem, effectively closing the door between leaf and
plant, and causing the leaf to fall off. It may be that the
abscission layer in oaks and beeches isn't as thick as it is in
other trees, and the leaves just hang on longer, hoping that the
tree will hear them knocking and open up, or at least send out a
warm sap toddy.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that the bundle of vascular tissue
between the leaf stem and the twig is larger or stronger in these
trees, and that it just takes more time and effort to break it.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, these trees are always stubborn, always the last to
let go of last year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Missing Snow
</P>
<P>
   Q. My father and I have noticed that trees in the park seem to
melt the snow right around their trunks, baring the ground up to a
foot or two away. This seems to happen even while the snow is
fairly thick around everything else (even lamp posts and benches).
My father has heard that there's some enzymatic activity around
tree roots that makes the soil above them just a teeny bit warmer.
But if this is so, why wouldn't the ring of melted snow be as wide
as the tree's root spread, which is surely on average larger than
two feet?
</P>
<P>
   A. Your father has the right idea, but the wrong plants. Dr. Tom
Whitlow, an associate professor of plant physiological ecology at
Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., said that there are some
plants, jack-in-the-pulpit, for example, that release enough heat
as part of their respiration process that they not only melt
surrounding snow as they begin to grow in the early spring, they
can actually feel warm to the touch.
</P>
<P>
   But this respiration process is unusual, and is not shared by
any trees that he knows of. Instead, he said, the melted snow you
notice is probably due to a combination of the sun's heat being
absorbed and then radiated by the dark bark, and the run-off of
water from snow melting on the branches. Mixing water with snow
does more than just help melt the snow, it also makes the snow
wetter, and wet snow is a better conductor of the radiated heat
than is powdery, dry snow.
</P>
<P>
   Next time you see a tree with a bare trunk, look around it and
see if there is more snow melted on the south side than on the
north. Since there is more sun from the south, the melted circle
shouldn't be symmetrical. &QL;

   Shortcuts Save Steps
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are desktop shortcuts and alias files the same thing?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, but they are on different computer platforms. Shortcuts
and alias sit conveniently on a computer desktop. In Windows 95 and
98, they are called shortcuts; in Macintosh, aliases. Whatever you
call them, shortcuts and aliases serve as time-saving pointers to
frequently used documents, folders or even programs on your
computer and can be placed directly on your desktop, serve as time
savers that can be placed directly on your desktop, where they
offer quick, one-step access to frequently used documents, folders
and even programs.
</P>
<P>
   To make a shortcut in Windows 95 or 98, click on My Computer,
then go into the hard drive (probably drive C) and find the file,
program or folder that you want a shortcut for. Click on the item
with the right mouse button and drag it onto the desktop. A pop-up
menu will ask if you want to move it, copy it or create a shortcut.
Select shortcut, and a new icon with a small black arrow above the
item's name will appear on your desktop.
</P>
<P>
   If you are using a Macintosh with System 7.5 or later and want
to make an alias, click once on the icon for the item. Under the
File menu, select Make Alias (or press Command M on the keyboard).
The alias of the file will appear next to the original item. You
can drag the alias to wherever you would like it to be on your
desktop.

BOBBING FOR LITERARY PLUMS ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When my 9-year-old daughter brought home an arts and crafts book
called ``Confetti'' from the school library three months ago, she
must have had me confused with a different sort of mother, the kind
who likes to create perfect homemade decorations for a Halloween
party.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, we had the party all right _ I will not try to shock you
with the details of 15 children bobbing for apples, then running
crazily through the house with wet hair and pieces of fruit still
gripped in their teeth _ but we never once opened that book. Our
decorations consisted mainly of a set of orange plastic dishes
(circa 1967) purchased for $2 from a secondhand store in town.
Also, my husband taped a strip of black crepe paper to the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   So what became of the book? It was my recollection at the time,
and remains my testimony, that ``Confetti'' got mixed in with all
the cookbooks, phone directories and catalogs that crowd the
bookcase in the kitchen. I never thought about it again until one
day last week when my daughter Zoe came home looking sick. ``I lost
that book so the librarian says I have to pay for it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you look in the bookcase?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three times.'' I negotiated a deal with terms highly favorable
to me (a month of chores, to be specified later) to front her the
money to pay for the book, figuring that I had heard the last of
``Confetti.'' But the next day, the librarian phoned. ``The book is
out of print,'' she said. ``So we probably won't be able to replace
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't give up,'' I reassured her. ``I might be able to find a
copy.''
</P>
<P>
   Such an offer would have been hubris just a few years ago, when
the best way to find an out-of-print book was to ask a local
used-book store to query an unofficial network of other sellers. In
those dark days, it could take weeks to get a response, if you got
one at all. I have spent years trying to track down a copy of a
children's novel called ``Me and Caleb,'' picking over countless
stacks of remaindered library books in search of a piece of my
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, retrieving lost books has changed for the better.
I found out just how much better last month when I went to
www.bibliofind.com to search for ``Black-Eyed Susan,'' a novel I
read when I was 7. Armed with only the title, I searched the
database of more than 3,500 book dealers and 9 million titles.
Almost instantly the site supplied a list of books with the same
title.
</P>
<P>
   I recognized my ``Black-Eyed Susan'' as the one whose author was
Evelyn Trent Bachmann. The site said the book was published in 1968
and that a bookseller in Ames, Iowa, had a first edition in very
fine condition. After exchanging e-mail with the bookseller and
mailing $30, I received the package within a week. I ripped it open
and got my first glimpse of an old friend who had disappeared for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   I admit that I got a little out of control after that. I tracked
down a $9 copy of ``The Secret of the Crazy Quilt'' (a 1972 novel
about a girl who discovers dark family secrets _ trust me, it's
great), a $15 copy of ``Ballet Shoes'' (the 1937 classic about
three orphaned girls who go on stage) and, to ease my husband's
transition to the post-football season, a $2 paperback of
``Semi-Tough'' by Dan Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   So after assuring the librarian that I could find ``Confetti,''
I went to Bibliofind. But I found nothing. I filled out a ``book
wanted'' form; the site promised to keep looking for up to six
months.
</P>
<P>
   I next tried www.powells.com, maintained by a well-known
bookstore in Portland, Ore. Searching its inventory of more than 1
million new and used books, I could purchase copies of other books
by the authors of ``Confetti'' but not ``Confetti'' itself. At that
point, I decided I needed a metasearch engine. So I went to
www.bookfinder.com, a one-stop tool for simultaneously searching a
number of large, distinct databases that contain a total of more
than 10 million books. Still no ``Confetti.''
</P>
<P>
   I decided to take the unusual step of going to www.amazon.com to
place an order for the out-of-print book. The reason I hesitate to
do this is simple: I am cheap. I buy plenty of new books from
Amazon.com because its prices substantially beat my local
bookstore's. But Amazon.com tacks on a finder's fee for
out-of-print books, a cost that depends on how hard it is to track
down the title. Since Amazon.com relies on some of the same sources
as Bookfinder and Bibliofind, it's usually cheaper to do the
legwork yourself.
</P>
<P>
   But I was desperate. So I placed an order _ knowing that I would
have the option to cancel it if the copy that Amazon.com tracked
down seemed too pricey. The site told me it would take a week or
two to search.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are patient enough to wait that long. Me? Facing
visions of a disappointed school librarian, I phoned Amazon.com two
minutes later to ask the company's media-relations librarian, Dj
Alton, why I was having so much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Alton explained that it was often easier to track down
out-of-print novels than niche-market books like ``Confetti,''
which might have had a smaller publication run. ``It's detective
work,'' he said. ``We'll try.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later, I still hadn't heard from Amazon. But you never
know where you'll find treasure. In the meantime, as I was trying
to compose a note to the librarian that sounded hopeful without
being unrealistic, my daughter came running in. In her hand, she
clutched a copy of the elusive ``Confetti.'' She said she had found
it in the bookcase in the kitchen.

FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD, DINOSAURS AWAIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETH SCHACHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a Tyrannosaurus rex shows up on your computer screen, your
spine doesn't tingle as it does when the giant beast dwarfs you at
a museum. On the other hand, when you read on line about how
dinosaur eggs were discovered in Patagonia, you are not likely to
be bashed in the shin by errant baby strollers.
</P>
<P>
   Natural history and paleontology museums are exploring new ways
to use the Internet to complement exhibits and enhance science
education. The results so far have been promising for curators and
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Museum scientists can use the Internet to offer new windows into
paleontology. Many museums have vast collections but limited space
for displaying their artifacts, and financial restrictions can also
limit the size and style of exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is also a good place to see specimens that are too
delicate to display openly and others that are barely visible to
the naked eye but are captivating when magnified.
</P>
<P>
   Museums are also beginning to experiment with the Internet as an
education tool that can attract children and adults who might
otherwise feel alienated from science. Science textbooks, even
those for college students, provide little insight into the real
working life of scientists, but online exhibits can easily present
such details.
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists realize that many people find dinosaurs
fascinating and enjoy fossil hunting. Many museum-based educators
are responding to this interest by showing enthusiasts what is
involved in paleontology research. Taking advantage of the
Internet, they help people learn about the kinds of questions
paleontologists ask, the kinds of tools they use to look for
answers and the process in which new answers lead to new questions.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring a museum Web site does not replace the experience of
roaming through the actual galleries, but it can enhance the
on-site experience. Previewing a museum Web site before your actual
visit can help you identify the displays you want to visit. After
your visit, a look at the Web site may give you additional
information about the exhibits you saw firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   Such Web sites can whet one's appetite for information. Since
exploring the paleontology museum Web sites, I've made several
trips to the American Museum of Natural History in New York to gaze
at the myriad fossils. I got my first New York Public Library card
in order to explore paleontology more deeply, and I am midway
through two terrific books: ``Taking Wing: Archaeopteryx and the
Evolution of Bird Flight'' by Pat Shipman (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1998)
and ``Wonderful Life: the Burgess Shale and the Nature of History''
by Stephen Jay Gould (W.W. Norton &AMP; Co., 1989).
</P>
<P>
   My virtual explorations of paleontology on the Internet led me
to many Web sites, including those described below.
</P>
<P>
   Among others, I toured the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Canada
(www.tyrrellmuseum.com), where I learned about museum-sponsored
digs for the general public. Now I'm saving my money to go on a
real fossil hunt. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MUSEUM OF PALEONTOLOGY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.ucmp.berkeley.edu &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The richness of this online museum is not found in
state-of-the-art interactive features. The museum team elected to
keep dynamic features to a minimum until user-friendly software
became available and has begun adding fancier features only
recently.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the museum provides text _ sometimes with pictures, and
frequently with photographs of exceptional quality _ that tells a
lot about paleontologic research.
</P>
<P>
   The site, one of the first 50 on the Web, was started in 1993 by
some visionary graduate students _ Robert P. Guralnick, P.David
Polly and Allen G. Collins _ from the department of integrative
biology at the University of California at Berkeley. They
recognized early the Internet's potential for showing the outside
world the processes and thrills of scientific research. The site
now registers about a million hits per week.
</P>
<P>
   Readers enter the main hall, Paleontology Without Walls, through
one of three interlinked portals: Phylogeny presents the Family
Tree of Life, Geologic Time shows who shared the earth with whom
during each geologic era, and Evolutionary Thought describes the
work of major evolutionary biologists, paleontologists and
geologists. Brief essays tell the history that led to Charles
Darwin's theory of the origin of species and describe the
controversy that followed.
</P>
<P>
   The Family Tree of Life lets the reader meander through exhibits
of the domains of life, from microscopic bacteria to extinct
creatures like the quagga. One important side trip explains
cladistics, the technique used for figuring out how organisms, both
living and extinct, are related to one another.
</P>
<P>
   The site's Special Exhibits include Dinobuzz, which covers
current dinosaur research. It answers such questions as, How fast
did dinosaurs move? While Hollywood films like ``Jurassic Park''
may show dinosaurs running at a cheetah's pace, Dinobuzz presents
the real evidence. The distance between the fossil imprints of
dinosaur feet, along with the absence of tracks from their large
tails, help answer the question about dinosaur speed. The evidence
suggests that some of these beasts could lope along at 26 miles per
hour.
</P>
<P>
   The Special Exhibit on Vertebrate Flight shows how scientists
develop hypotheses, then look for evidence to support or to refute
them. Did the ancestors of birds first fly by gliding from the
treetops, or did they run fast along the ground and jump into the
air?
</P>
<P>
   The current wisdom now favors the ground-up idea rather than the
trees-down) hypothesis. As you read on, you learn how scientists
study flight in modern birds and look at fossil remains to learn
how bird flight evolved.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's director, David Lindberg, said the Web site was as
much an encyclopedia as a virtual museum. The museum staff is
currently designing interactive Internet-based programs for
teaching the process of paleontology in middle school and high
school. New programs will include both tours and interactive
laboratory research modules.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Scotchmoor, the museum's education and outreach director,
showed me the first research module, which is near completion. It
draws on a real field study in Montana that museum researchers are
conducting and will let students and their teachers study fossils
from the Cretaceous/Tertiary (or K/T) boundary, which marks the end
of the dinosaur era.
</P>
<P>
   Users will be able to take a virtual journey to the field to
collect specimens then return to a Berkeley laboratory to sort and
classify them. Using the interactive tools, students will learn how
to do things like distinguishing teeth from tiny bone fragments and
inspecting the teeth to determine their source.
</P>
<P>
   Students will record their findings in online journals, then
submit hypotheses about the ancient environment they are studying.
Each class can send a report to the museum and receive a response
from graduate students and faculty researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The modules are being created in a novel way by museum
scientists and graduate students in collaboration with middle
school and high school biology teachers. After seeing the
interactive research module, I left with the feeling that these
Internet pioneers were exploring exciting territory. They are
making the process of paleontology come alive. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Deep within the Gobi Desert, Dr. Michael Novacek, a
paleontologist, had just completed an online interview with his
colleagues back home at the American Museum of Natural History in
Manhattan. Soon after, he got an e-mail message from a boy in New
Delhi asking whether he had found a velociraptor skeleton that day.
``Here we were, in one of the world's most deserted places,'' he
said recently. ``Suddenly I felt more in communication with the
population of the planet than I ever did in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Novacek, senior vice president and provost for science at the
American Museum of Natural History and co-leader of the museum's
Gobi Expedition, relishes the museum's role in turning cyberspace
into an interactive showcase for paleontology. For the past two
years, the museum has used the Internet to link the world to its
scientists on the Gobi fossil hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists on the 1998 trip gave interviews that people
could hear through live Webcasts and submitted nightly e-mail
dispatches, which were immediately posted on the Web site. The
results reflected life on a dig. Some days were thrilling, while
others were hot, tiring and boring. The thrills came in many forms
_ new fossil discoveries as well as torrential hailstorms.
</P>
<P>
   A History in the Desert, written by the team's co-leader, Mark
A. Norell, accompanies the dispatches. This narrative describes the
Gobi locale, which contains the most extensive finds to date on
animals from the dinosaur age. Links to other sites point to
drawings of fossil animals found on this expedition.
</P>
<P>
   The daily Web dispatches from the Gobi expedition are only one
creative way in which the museum uses electronic media. Nancy
Hechinger, director of the museum's National Center for Science
Literacy, Education and Technology, noted that the museum's
Internet projects extended, rather than imitated, the features
provided at the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Another area, Dinosaur Discoveries in Patagonia, on the Web site
details another of the museum's famous expeditions. A team leader,
Luis M. Chiappe, provides clear narratives about the discovery in
1997 of dinosaur eggs containing embryos, skin and all in
Patagonia, a remote part of Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   To complement this text, the Web site contains pictures of the
fossils embedded in rock. As the viewer moves around the frame, the
fossil is highlighted against the rock background.
</P>
<P>
   The fossil skull exhibit allows an interactive approach. Here
you can compare the skull of a modern human with the skulls of
several close primate relatives. Moving the mouse within the frame
rotates each pair of skulls left or right, or up or down.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the site's Fossil Halls display reveals another
example of effective electronic media. In the Hall of Vertebrate
Origins, users learn how scientists constructed the vertebrate
family tree.
</P>
<P>
   The page features a simple tree, called a cladogram. Take care
to let the program download, then move your mouse to the Expedition
Guide panel at the left. Click on the Vertebral Column and
Braincase, and you get a diagram and text explaining that the
backbone and braincase were the first features that distinguished
vertebrates from other animals.
</P>
<P>
   By bookmarking the Electronic Newspaper address found in the
site's Fossil Halls, you can easily return for more paleontology
news. &QL;

<P>
   THE HOOPER VIRTUAL NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.wf.carleton.ca/Museum/lobby.html &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Tim Patterson, an associate professor of earth
science at Carleton University in Ottawa, started giving his
undergraduate students a choice: they could turn in traditional
term papers on topics in paleontology, or they could create
relevant Web pages. Each year, about half the class has opted for
the latter. These classroom assignments are now on the Web as the
Hooper Virtual Natural History Museum, produced largely by
third-year undergraduates majoring in geoscience.
</P>
<P>
   The museum was named to honor Dr. Ken Hooper, the first
paleontologist in the earth sciences department. Its virtual wings
range from The Mammalarium to Microfossils and Theoretical
Paleontology. Students have selected the topics for their
presentations, resulting in a pleasantly broad range of subjects in
each of the wings.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the Flight wing, you will find The Flying
Dragons, the pterosaurs. You can choose to see an animation of the
beast in flight or go on to a page offering a range of information
about pterosaurs _ plus a fanciful depiction of a pterosaur
attempting to rescue Fay Wray and battling King Kong. Click on the
navigation icon at the bottom of the page, and you move from
fantasy back to reality.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a well-crafted presentation about the pterosaur,
including information that is easy for nonscientists, including
children, to grasp. The author poses several questions: Did these
extinct flying lizards walk on two legs or on all four? Were they
warmblooded or not? He provides answers and identifies the
controversies that remain. Excellent illustrations, complete with
citations, are included.
</P>
<P>
   Other noteworthy presentations include Gastropoda: Snails
Throughout the Ages, in the Invertebrates wing; Burgess Shale:
Hidden Treasure in the Canadian Rockies, in the Fantastic Fossil
Finds wing; and Evolution and Creationism: An Objective Evaluation,
in the Evolution and Extinction wing.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said the presentation quality improved each year. So
while each exhibit remains within a museum wing for a year, some
are moved to the Archives after that.
</P>
<P>
   With traditional homework assignments, only two people _ the
student author and the teacher _ read most term papers. Patterson
said that because his students had a way to share their work with a
broader audience via the Web site, many of them took greater care
with their projects. Moreover, public display of the work helps
students learn from one another.
</P>
<P>
   Even the best presentations on this site could benefit from
further editing and tweaking. Patterson said students continued to
modify their online exhibits and improve their homework on their
own time, well after the works are posted (and, of course, grades
are given).
</P>
<P>
   Although secondary students with passions for dinosaur hunting
often consider careers in paleontology, many do not know about the
necessary training. A tour through the Hooper Virtual Natural
History Museum offers an excellent view of the matters that concern
fossil hunters when they are not digging in the field.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some homeowners get perturbed when they find that even though
they have a new furnace with a state-of-the-art heating system,
there is always one room in the house that is cold. Turning up the
thermostat will warm the room, but it may also make the rest of the
house too hot and create higher heating bills.
</P>
<P>
   What is the best way to bring heat into that cold room?
Unfortunately there is no easy answer because the chill may come
from a number of causes. First, it's important to examine the
heating system to make sure that heat is indeed being delivered to
the room. In extreme cases, it may be necessary to consult a
heating specialist who can evaluate your home heating system to
determine if it is operating efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   First, inspect the system yourself to see if there are any
obvious malfunctions. With a few simple adjustments, you may be
able to correct the problem and save yourself a consultation fee.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a forced-air system, look first at the air filter. A
dirty filter can restrict the flow of hot air from the furnace to
the delivery ducts. Many homeowners neglect to change air filters
at the beginning of the season. As a result, the system cannot
deliver heat efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Inspect the heat outlet, or register, in the cold room. It is
usually in the floor near a wall. Feel to make sure that heat is
coming out. If not, it could be blocked. Unscrew the register cover
and look down with a flashlight. Remove any obstructions.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no blockage, examine the ducts that feed air into
the room. These usually have dampers that control the flow of air
through the duct. Make sure that they are in the open position. If
these measures do not restore the proper air flow, the problem
could be more serious, like faulty duct design. It is best to
consult with a heating specialist to see if this is the case.
</P>
<P>
   If hot air is coming out of the register, it is likely that it
is not flowing toward the center of the room. This can happen if a
piece of furniture is positioned over the register. The obvious
solution is to move the furniture. Another way to redirect the air
flowing from a register is by installing plastic deflectors. These
are available in a variety of shapes that allow you to control the
air-flow patterns in a room.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a steam-heating system with radiators, inspect the
room radiators to see if they are hot. Cold radiators may not be
leveled properly. A radiator that is perfectly level or pitched
away from the intake valve will trap water so steam cannot enter.
Raise one end with small wood blocks so the radiator slopes toward
the valve.
</P>
<P>
   Another cause of cold radiators is a blocked air vent. The air
vent is the small chrome-plated cylinder mounted on one end of the
radiator. It allows air to escape from the radiator so steam can
enter. If the vent is blocked, the radiator will never heat up.
Sometimes you can open a blocked vent port with a thin wire, but
it's best to install a new vent.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to buy variable adjustment vents that allow you
to regulate the amount of air released and, consequently, the
amount of steam entering the radiator. If the radiator doesn't heat
up, simply turn the adjustment control on top of the vent to allow
more air to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Modern hot-water radiators are less problematic because they are
part of a closed system. Still, air can collect in the radiators
and keep the hot water out. These units have a purge valves that
allow you to release the tapped air. Purging the air from a hot
water radiator is not difficult. Hold a metal container under the
valve port and open the vent with a screwdriver. Keep the vent open
until all the air is released and water begins to flow, then close
the vent.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most efficient heating system will fail to keep a room
warm if cold air is allowed to enter through the gaps and cracks in
an old window. The best way to remedy this problem is by replacing
the old windows with new, energy- efficient ones. This is
expensive, and such an installation may not be possible in the
middle of winter. As a temporary seasonal fix, you can install
plastic indoor ''storm'' windows, available as kits at most home
centers. Tape the plastic sheet over the window then heat it with a
hair dryer to make it taut.

   For many, the computer mouse is a marvel of ingenuity. But for
Dr. George E. Gerpheide, an engineer, it is an abomination. He set
out to build, if not a better mousetrap, then something to rid
society of the inelegant mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed clunky,'' said Gerpheide, who is 46. ``What the
world needed was a pointing device that matched people's
expectations and looked like it belonged in the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years and 19 unsuccessful prototypes built after hours
in the basement of his home, he hit upon the solution in 1988: an
electronic touch pad that would register the slightest twitch of a
finger and translate it into cursor movements on the monitor. He
picked the nickname ``cat'' for his rival to the mouse and founded
the Cirque Corp., where he is now chief executive, to market the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Apple was the first to license Gerpheide's technology and take
it to market. It incorporated a touch pad 11/2 inches wide into its
Powerbook laptops in 1994, replacing the built-in trackball.
</P>
<P>
   Most laptop manufacturers, with the exception of IBM and
Toshiba, which employ a joystick, have adopted touch pads. Nearly
all of the laptop touch pad market is now divided between Alps
Electric, a Japanese company that licenses Gerpheide's technology,
and Synaptics, a competitor based in San Jose, Calif. (Apple
switched a few years ago to Synaptics technology.)
</P>
<P>
   Cirque, which makes Glide Point touch pads and is based in Salt
Lake City, made 70 percent of the touch pads sold as accessories
(primarily for use with desktops) in the first 11 months of 1998,
according to PC Data, a market research company.
</P>
<P>
   Touch pads range from the size of a pack of matches to that of a
small wallet. They rely on minute flows of electric current and how
those currents are modified by the human finger's effect on small
electric fields, so moisture or electromagnetic interference can
diminish performance. That was particularly true of early touch
pads.
</P>
<P>
   What touch-pad users do not have to worry about is peanut
butter, cookie crumbs or hair fouling any moving parts, as they can
in a mechanical mouse, which dates from the mid-60s. They also do
not need to make space on their desks for a mouse to roam in.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike touch screens and some touch pads called resistive, which
require pressure from a finger or stylus to function, one need not
actually touch the surface of a capacitive touch pad to make it
work. The finger can affect electric fields in the touch pad even
when it is merely near the surface.
</P>
<P>
   But if a business card or two is placed on top of a touch pad,
that extra insulation will keep it from registering the presence of
a finger running on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage of newer models of touch pads is that they can
be trained to recognize handwritten commands. Synaptics sells a
model, popular in China, that enables users to use their fingertips
to enter Chinese characters into the computer. If used properly,
the touch pad is less likely to cause repetitive stress injuries
because touch-pad users do not have to grip or press anything.
</P>
<P>
   The finger movements required are subtle and relatively easy.
But Dr. John Kella, an ergonomics consultant to The New York Times,
said touch-pad users still needed to be careful. ``With any
tracking device, the user should take frequent breaks, flex and
move the muscles and joints,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerpheide offered a few tips for using a touch pad: (a) The
lighter the touch, the better the touch pad works. (b) For a large
cursor movement, slide the finger; for a more precise movement,
hold the finger still and roll the tip from side to side. (c) A
double tap equals a double click of the mouse. To highlight and
drag an object, use a tap and a half: tap once, then lower the
finger and leave it down.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the advantages of touch pads, they have been slow to
catch on, especially among desktop users, who may have had bad
experiences with the first generation of touch pads, which were
less precise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're currently in our fifth generation, light-years ahead of
what you find on a notebook computer,'' Gerpheide said. It takes
roughly two years for the product cycle to catch up to new
touch-pad technology, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Other users are simply more comfortable with the more familiar
mouse, but Gerpheide is banking that the rapid evolution of
technology will change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the post-PC era, when you're talking about mobile
appliances,'' he said, ``the mouse is not suitable. Nobody wants a
mouse dangling from their Net-connected cell phone.''

MAKING BOOKS: A PLACE FOR POETS, PERHAPS NOT FOR GIANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where have all the poets gone, long time passing; where have all
the poets gone, long time ago? It may not be that young girls pick
them, everyone, but several major publishing houses do.
</P>
<P>
   Poetry has become a consequential part of a few publishing
programs, and it's not just Jewel and Springsteen and Dylan and
Cobain either, but Robert Pinsky and Mark Strand and Deborah
Garrison and Frederick Seidel and Sharon Olds and others whose
names and work you may not know either, but whose art is more
literary than the songwriter poets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is not one major poet who has the crossover
recognition in mainstream America that a Robert Frost or a Wallace
Stevens or a Marianne Moore had (although she might have been as
well known for being photographed in large hats and beautiful black
velvet at baseball games as for her poetry), with the possible
exception of the best-selling Maya Angelou, who is probably known
more for her memoirs than for her poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the proliferation of literary poetry, why is there
no one artist who bestrides this terrain? Perhaps because there is
no one American language. The Scotch and the Irish, for instance,
each have their own luxurious national languages. The United States
doesn't. It is too polyglot, too regional for that.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it always was, but even as recently as Wallace
Stevens, who died in 1955, the country paid little attention to its
powerful diversity, and the national language was white and male
and middle-class. Rap, for instance, might as well have come from
the far side of the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Meneka, who is senior editor and in essence poetry editor
of Random House, said that there were ``a huge number of
multicultural threads, pulling together a bit now, maybe because of
the Internet, and maybe because of that we'll see a more national
picture in the world of poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If so,'' he continued, ``it remains to be seen who will emerge
as high-profile figures.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Galassi, the editor in chief at Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux
and himself an accomplished poet and translator of the poetry and
essays of the Italian writer Eugenio Montale, agrees that ``a lot
of Americans are interested in language, but there are regional and
ethnic idioms _ a lot of different consistencies, more of a grab
bag of different groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Meneka and Galassi see, if not exactly a great surge of
interest in poetry, certainly an increasing pursuit of it by
publishers and the public. Virginia Hamilton Adair, who was 83 and
blind when her first book, ``Ants on the Melon,'' was published two
years ago, and Deborah Garrison, author of ``A Working Girl Can't
Win'' (1998), both sold well for Random House. There are 20,000
copies of Ms. Garrison's book in print, a goodly number for poetry.
``We should be a pure purist about what poetry we publish,'' Meneka
said. ``We shouldn't worry about pegs. Nevertheless, a suitcase
carries better with a handle on it. `Working Girl' has a built-in
demographic _ the young working professional and her plights and
her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of a contemporary celebrity poet, the Alfred A.
Knopf publishing group last year still sold 250,000 books of
poetry, hardback and paperback, which was not bad for something so
many people apparently feel is intimidating if not actually
menacing in its mannered pithiness on the page. The figure is
slightly misleading since it includes Knopf's Everyman's Pocket
Poetry Series, which has 30 books in print ranging from Emily
Dickinson to an anthology of erotica.
</P>
<P>
   Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux and Random House publish serious poetry,
as of course do the university presses. Galassi, who is also
president of the Academy of American Poets, said that his house
``actually does make a little money out of publishing poetry, but
it's about the way we think of literature _ when people quote, what
do they quote most often but poetry. So it's not a byproduct of
what we do, not a side issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrar, Straus over the years has published T.S. Eliot and
Robert Lowell and Joseph Brodsky and Seamus Heaney, among its
poets. Last year the publishing house sold more than 100,000 copies
of Ted Hughes' ``Birthday Letters,'' although that large number
could probably be attributed mostly to the fact that the poems
discussed, for the first time, his doomed relationship with his
wife, the poet Sylvia Plath, whose suicide at the age of 30 turned
her into a feminist icon and him, for many, into a dark presence.
</P>
<P>
   HarperCollins paid seven figures to publish the songwriter
Jewel's best-selling ``A Night Without Armor,'' but then not every
poet comes to the calling with a mega-platinum disk in her agent's
pocket. Last year Crown published ``the complete poems and lyrics''
of Joni Mitchell. (Were they poems? Yes, mostly, whatever their
lasting quality, although both books raised the question of where
is the line between poems and lyrics.)
</P>
<P>
   However one looks at it, things are happening in poetry. Bill
Wadsworth, executive director of the Academy of American Poets,
said that membership had grown from 2,000 to 8,000 during the last
four years and that the organization now supported poetry prizes at
160 colleges and universities. It also awards the annual Tanning
Prize of $100,000 to the poet of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Slate, the online magazine, features a weekly poem selected by
Pinsky, America's poet laureate. Click the right ``here'' and you
can even hear Pinsky read the poem. There are even ``poetry
slams,'' which means that conventional poetry readings often have
been replaced by a performance art that combines poetry and rock
and, well, athletics. The performing poets are scored by judges in
the same way Olympic ice-skaters are scored.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   No one remembers seeing a newspaper want ad that said ``poet
wanted,'' so it's nearly impossible to make a living by simply
writing poetry. The usual advance for a poet is $10,000 to $15,000,
although $2,500 advances are not rare. Very occasionally, a poet
might receive a $25,000 advance. Ten thousand copies is an
excellent ego-building first printing; 20,000 borders on being
newsworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Most poets earn their living teaching. Frederick Seidel, whose
well- received ``Going East'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux) was
published last summer, writes screenplays. What makes him unusual
is that when he was young and was asked the eternal question what
do you want to be, he answered not fireman or forest ranger but
poet.
</P>
<P>
   Reading Ezra Pound's ``Cantos'' in ``my school library in St.
Louis stunned me,'' Seidel said. `` `What thou lovest most
remains.' Reading that lyric got to me; it was a moment. It's the
pleasure of rounding words, it's gripping, it's a transportation.
As a writer you go places, you aim, you aspire, you're
transported.''
</P>
<P>
   And for him there was, not unnaturally for a young man, hero
worship, not for a ball player but for a poet. At the time, Pound
was considered a crazy traitor to his country. ``He wrote those
poems while being held in a cage, imprisoned, the cage made of the
metal matting they used for airfield runways,'' Seidel said.
</P>
<P>
   He accounts for the increased interest in poetry, in part, by
the explosion in the number of creative writing classes at colleges
and universities: ``Years ago there were hardly any; now it's a big
part of a university's liberal arts program. That means there's
lots of poetry being written; doesn't mean good poetry, but more
poetry, and that's important. Poems are meant to be a pleasure.
They instruct by pleasing.''
</P>
<P>
   How will technology affect the popularity of poetry? Since
poetry by its nature tends to be terse, and its books generally
slim, perhaps there will be little need to cram your electronic
book with verse, but many people in publishing believe that the
ability to publish one's own book on demand means getting your
rhythms the very moment you want them, easily and cheaply, and that
will make poetry more popular. As will the ability to not only read
poetry on the Internet but hear it as well.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States is not a language-oriented nation,
people still seem to feel a need to write poetry, as has every
schoolgirl and boy whose heart was broken. Poetry is the history of
emotion. It is imprinted on a page, and it has to stay put, always
available. Looked at that way, perhaps it doesn't need a superstar.

KEY QUESTIONS IN BATTLE BETWEEN WHITE HOUSE AND GOP PROSECUTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the historic Senate impeachment trial gets under
way Thursday, President Clinton's legal team and House Republican
prosecutors will square off in a go-for-broke final weighing of the
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-member House team led by Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde
will attempt to prove that the president, sworn to uphold the
Constitution and enforce the laws, is guilty of the crimes of
perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, White House Counsel Charles Ruff, White House
special counsel Gregory Craig, and David Kendall, Clinton's private
lawyer, will unleash a scorched-earth attack on Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's findings of possible impeachment offenses by
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to arguing that the offenses alleged do not fall
under the Constitution's impeachment standard of ``high crimes and
misdemeanors,'' the Clinton lawyers will try to pick holes in the
Starr investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The first impeachment article approved by the House last month
charges Clinton with lying under oath during his Aug. 17, 1998,
federal grand jury appearance about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky. While acknowledging ``inappropriate intimate contact''
with the former White House intern, Clinton stuck by his previous
denial that he ever had ``sexual relations'' with Lewinsky. That
denial came Jan. 17, 1998 in his deposition in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment lawsuit and was based on a definition of sexual
relations provided by Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The second article charges Clinton with obstructing justice by
taking steps to hide his affair with Lewinsky. It says Clinton
urged her to deny the affair in an affidavit to the Jones lawyers,
helped her find a job in exchange for her silence and assigned his
secretary Betty Currie to retrieve from Lewinsky the gifts he had
given her.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some key questions likely to come up:
</P>
<P>
   DID CLINTON LIE ABOUT HAVING `SEXUAL RELATIONS' WITH LEWINSKY?
</P>
<P>
   During his grand jury appearance, Clinton acknowledged
``inappropriate intimate contact'' with Lewinsky but claimed that
his deposition in the Jones case denying ``sexual relations'' was
technically correct and within the definition provided by Jones'
lawyers because he and Lewinsky never had sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors say Clinton was lying. The definition was
broad enough to cover any touching for sexual stimulation, they
contend, but Clinton in essence was saying he received such
stimulation from Lewinsky but never touched her himself. Lewinsky,
the House prosecutors note, testified Clinton touched her in a
sexual manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``While his treatment of Ms. Lewinsky was offensive, it is much
more offensive for the president to expect the Senate to believe
that ... his intimate contact with Ms. Lewinsky was so limited that
it did not fall within his narrow interpretation of a definition of
`sexual relations,''' the House prosecutors said in their Jan. 11
trial brief.
</P>
<P>
   The White House team is said to believe it can more easily
defend Clinton's grand jury testimony than his deposition in the
Jones case, in which Clinton said it was ``absolutely true'' that,
as his lawyer Robert Bennett put it, ``there was absolutely no sex
of any kind.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House trial memorandum released Wednesday says that on
discrepancies between Lewinsky and Clinton over when the
relationship began, whether he touched her sexually and the extent
to which they were alone: ``Should the will of the people be
overruled and the president ... removed from office because two
people have a different recollection of the details of a wrongful
relationship _ which the president has admitted?''
</P>
<P>
   DID CLINTON ENCOURAGE LEWINSKY TO SIGN A FALSE AFFIDAVIT?
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans cite a 2 a.m. phone call Dec. 17, 1997 from
Clinton to Lewinsky in which, they say, he asked her to lie about
their relationship. He informed her that her name had appeared on a
witness list submitted by the Jones lawyers. Lewinsky told the
grand jury that Clinton said, ``Well, maybe you can sign an
affidavit'' denying the relationship, and ``you can always say you
were coming to see Betty (Currie) or that you were bringing me
letters.'' Lewinsky signed the affidavit on Jan. 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers argue that Clinton suggested only that
Lewinsky might sign a ``truthful but limited'' affidavit. During
his grand jury testimony, Clinton said he never talked to Lewinsky
about her approach to the affidavit, but ``if she defined `sexual
relationship' in the way that I think most Americans do, meaning
intercourse, then she told the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   DID CLINTON GET CURRIE TO RETRIEVE HIS GIFTS TO LEWINSKY?
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors point to Dec. 28, 1997, the day Clinton met
Lewinsky for the last time. The Jones lawyers' subpoena that
Lewinsky received nine days earlier required her to produce ``each
and every gift'' from Clinton. After he gave her holiday presents
including a stuffed animal and chocolates, Lewinsky broached the
subject of what to do about all the gifts. She suggested that
perhaps Currie could take charge of them. Lewinsky recalled Clinton
saying, ``I don't know'' or ``let me think about that.'' Later that
day, Lewinsky said, Currie called her and drove by Lewinsky's
Watergate apartment, took the boxed-up gifts home and put them
under her bed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers argue that if he was so concerned about hiding
gifts, he would not have given Lewinsky new ones. They accuse Starr
of ignoring other Lewinsky statements reporting that when she
brought up the gifts, Clinton said nothing. In none of her
statements about the issue, they add, did Lewinsky say Clinton told
her to conceal the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers accuse Starr of ignoring Currie's recollection that
it was Lewinsky who called and asked her to pick them up.
</P>
<P>
   DID CLINTON SEEK A JOB FOR LEWINSKY TO BUY HER SILENCE?
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors say Lewinsky asked Clinton to help her find a
job in New York in July 1997, but the assistance she received from
the president and his friend Vernon Jordan intensified in December
1997 at the time her name appeared on the Jones lawyers' witness
list. Clinton met Lewinsky on Dec. 6, 1997, the same day he learned
her name was on the list. When she complained that Jordan, a
high-powered Washington lawyer, had done nothing to find her a job,
Clinton replied, ``I'll talk to him. I'll get on it.'' Lewinsky met
Jordan five days later. On Jan. 9, 1998 _ two days after Lewinsky
signed the affidavit _ Revlon Inc. offered her a job in New York.
After learning of the offer, Jordan left a message for Clinton with
Betty Currie: ``Mission accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers contend that Lewinsky's job search was at
full throttle well before her name appeared on the Jones lawyers'
witness list. The White House team points to testimony from Revlon
executives that the company official who offered her a job had not
been told of Jordan's phone call to Revlon's chief executive on
Lewinsky's behalf the previous day.

`ART INFORMATION AND THE INTERNET': AN ART BOOK FOR BROWSING THE
INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS.: Publication notes are at the end of review.) 
(js) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes you have to stare at a work of art for a while before
appreciating it. ``Art Information and the Internet: How to Find
It, How to Use It,'' a recently published book from Oryx Press, is
a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Lois Swan Jones, whose 1990 book, ``Art Information:
Research Methods and Resources'' (Kendall-Hunt), is a standard
reference for educators, students and museum staff members, the new
book is serious stuff, too. At first glance, it seems useful only
to the same audience of researchers. But take time to look deeper
and ``Art Information and the Internet'' turns into a $45 resource
that many casual culture lovers, as well as art professionals, can
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art Information and the Internet'' is, in fact, a guide to
information on the Internet that you never knew you wanted _ but
will enjoy once you find it.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the sites under ``Museums and Libraries: Medieval and
Byzantine Collections'' on page 134. The Bodleian Library at Oxford
University (www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/welcome.html) lets you enter its
Map Case and call up a sampling of early maps: the London Docks of
1831 and America, circa 1800, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Pick ``early manuscripts'' and you can view several examples up
close. Or you can shop in the Bodleian Arcade, check in on the
Bodleian's Broadside Ballads Project, which is building a digitized
repertory of 30,000 ballads, or try the library's Toyota City
Imaging Project, which offers images from the John Johnson
Collection of auto ephemera.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever been puzzled by classical paintings, unable to
tell Aphrodite from Demeter or Ares from Hades? ``Art Information
and the Internet'' has a section on mythology (page 170), and one
of the listed sites, Classical Myth
(web.uvic.ca/grs/bowman/myth/index.html), may help. Besides giving
a brief timeline of Greek history, it has images and texts for each
Olympian god. Another section, called ``Attributes in
iconography,'' gives the symbols associated with each god.
</P>
<P>
   Like most sites, Classical Myth has links of related sites. One
of the best is the Perseus project (www.perseus.tufts.edu), a
digital library of resources for studying the ancient world that
includes texts and translations, maps and art images from more than
70 museums. You can also, for example, take a walk around ancient
Athens (click on Starting Points, then on Sites and click on any
triangle to see a photograph from that vantage).
</P>
<P>
   Animals can also be artistic symbols, but the Internet
references in this category (page 175) will not help. The Butterfly
Site (www.mgfx.com/butterfly) is charming, however, with
illustrated information on the butterflies of every state and other
places, plus links to sites-in-the-making on hummingbirds, birds
and dragonflies. The Unicorn Web Page is in French
(perso.wanadoo.fr/bruno.faidutli/licornes/unicorn.html).
</P>
<P>
   The book's Chapter 10, on art historical periods, offers some
good sites. In one example, readers are directed to an ancient art
site maintained by the University of Wisconsin's art history
department. And if you backtrack to the department's main site
(www.wisc.edu/arth) and look under ``course materials'' for various
classes, not just ancient art, you will find Assyrian, Renaissance,
French and Asian art images. Better yet is the department's ``Find
an Image'' section, which lets you sample the work of an artist,
architect, period or site around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 10 lists many, many other museum, university and other
sites, covering early civilization up to the present.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a real aid to find information about contemporary
artists online since they are by definition less known. ``Art
Information on the Internet'' first sends readers to galleries,
then suggests ``Worldwide Books On Line'' (www.worldwide.com). But
you will find little to see here. Go to ``Artist Index'' and you
can browse the names of some 6,000 artists, with not much more than
a roster of books or their catalogs. Using the ``Extended Search''
option will bring up a description of the book, but no images.
</P>
<P>
   Another section of the book, ``Pronunciation,'' on page 145
looked promising, perhaps the key to finding out at last the
correct way to say Ingres or Caillebotte. Alas, no; it recommends a
CD-ROM. Still, the section does direct readers to a
French-English/English-French dictionary
(humanities.uchicago.edu/formsunrest/FR-ENG.html) that works for
single words, but not titles or phrases.
</P>
<P>
   And so ``Art Information on the Internet'' goes, reflecting the
spottiness of World Wide Web sites themselves. Some references are
very good; others quite pedestrian. The publisher promises,
however, to keep current. It posts updates to the book on its Web
site &UR;  &LR; (www.oryxpress.com/artupdate).

JUSTICES EXAMINE WELFARE BENEFITS IN CALIFORNIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, delving into the
constitutionality of welfare reform efforts, on Wednesday
considered if benefit restrictions that California imposes on new
residents violate the constitutional freedom to travel.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was whether the Constitution permits California to
require people to live in the state for a year before they can
collect higher welfare benefits than they would have received in
their previous residence. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
San Francisco, agreeing with poor Californians who challenged the
restriction, has ruled that the law violates the freedom to travel
by discouraging welfare recipients from entering California.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the the state disputed the 9th Circuit's ruling,
arguing that the one-year waiting period for full benefits is a
temporary delay that only remotely hinders travel. Theodore
Garelis, California's deputy attorney general, said the delay
passes constitutional muster because it is a rational way for the
state to achieve its legitimate goal of encouraging new residents
to get off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   But attorney Mark Rosenbaum, representing new Californians on
welfare, countered that the reduced benefits for incoming residents
discourage poor people from exercising their freedom to travel.
Because it encroaches on a constitutional right, the law is valid
only if the state can prove it is narrowly written to achieve a
compelling state interest, Rosenbaum told the justices.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Solicitor General Seth Waxman, the Clinton administration's
chief advocate before the high court, agreed that the California
law impinges on the freedom to travel but added the interference
might not be so severe as to violate the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Garelis and Rosenbaum, Waxman argued that the
welfare statute should be upheld if California can show the
one-year delay is substantially related to achieving the important
governmental objectives Congress spelled out in a 1996 welfare
reform statute.
</P>
<P>
   Those goals include giving states greater flexibility in
operating assistance programs for needy families and encouraging
self-reliance and family stability.
</P>
<P>
   The justices appeared as divided as the lawyers, with several
indicating that the law is a substantial encroachment on the
freedom to travel and others regarding it as a mere inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, questioning the law's validity,
said the court has held that the right of people to travel is
greater than the authority of states to enact laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can pick their states, but states cannot pick their
people,'' Ginsburg said. ``That is the genius of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy disputed Garelis' contention that the
state's purpose in enacting the law was not to keep welfare
recipients out of the state. ``The whole purpose of this law was to
discourage migration,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Kennedy, Justice John Paul Stevens asked Garelis how the
state could argue that the law was not chiefly intended to convince
indigent people to stay away from California. The state presumably
sets benefits for long-term residents based on its cost of living,
meaning that the statute effectively forces new residents to make
do with inadequate funds for an entire year, Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Garelis responded that the welfare benefits do not reflect
California's cost of living. He said states have always provided
different welfare benefits and that the disparities have not raised
constitutional concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Antonin Scalia and Sandra Day O'Connor, indicating
support for California, said the state law might impose a mere
hindrance on the freedom to travel and not raise significant
constitutional concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia said states have many legitimate regulations that
discourage travel, such as those that assess higher licensing fees
on out of state residents. ``I would like to get Louisiana hunting
licenses at Louisiana-resident rates,'' added the justice, who
resides in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, picking up on Scalia's theme, said states have a
strong interest in charging higher rates for fishing licenses to
ensure that fish caught in the state are consumed in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosenbaum answered that people who seek to change their
state of residence have greater rights than those who merely visit
a state to hunt or fish. The freedom to travel embodies ``a right
not to be discriminated against based on the length of residence,''
Rosenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   That response led Scalia to poke a bit of fun at the Los Angeles
attorney's home state. ``I'm more interested in my right to travel
to California than I am in my right to live there,'' the justice
said.

TAX LAW SQUEEZES NOT-SO-RICH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   A story in BEGIN ITAL HERE The New York
Times END ITAL HERE on Sunday became the latest damning evidence of
how tax policy designed to soak the rich inevitably has harmful
unintended consequences for hard-working taxpayers trying to cope
with life's financial challenges.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The effort was headlined ``Funny, They Don't Look Like Fat
Cats,'' and its anecdotal focal point was the Klaassen family of
Marquette, Kan. David Klaassen and his wife, Margaret, have 13
children, including one 17-year-old son who has endured a long
fight with leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   Klaassen, a lawyer, made just under $90,000 in 1997 and paid
$5,989 in federal income taxes. A few weeks ago, Klaassen got a
notice from the Internal Revenue Service demanding $3,761 more in
taxes. The amount was due, the IRS said, under the alternative
minimum tax. It included a penalty because Klaassen was deemed to
have been aware he owed the AMT, as the tax is generally known.
</P>
<P>
   Klaassen acknowledges knowing of the potential AMT claim but
says the law wasn't intended to apply to somebody in his situation.
He has never, he said, invested in tax shelters or tax-free bonds
or other investments to avoid income taxes. The reason for his
relatively low tax liability is his 13 children and the medical
expenses incurred as a result of his son Aaron's leukemia fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of policy taxes you for spending money to save your
child's life?'' Klaassen asked.
</P>
<P>
   The kind so obsessed with squeezing the rich that it allows the
imposition of outrageous injustices on unintended victims. Over
time, however, governmental sclerosis renders a reasonable remedy
apparently impossible. Tax experts say both Congress and the
administration understand the unfairness of the law's current flaw
but can't agree on how to reform it in a way that best serves the
original intent.
</P>
<P>
   The AMT was born 30 years ago after a revelation that 155
wealthy Americans paid no income taxes. The alternative minimum tax
was devised to prevent the very rich from avoiding their fair share
of income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the story estimated, more than 2 million tax filers
will owe the AMT, and about half will have incomes from $30,000 to
$100,000. Paradoxically, many of the truly rich won't be among
those liable. Meanwhile, those subject to the AMT will expand over
the next decade by about 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   How did the AMT evolve into a source of tax oppression for
ordinary folk instead of a way to soak rich business owners and
investors? At the risk of oversimplification, here's what happened:
</P>
<P>
   When tax reform was undertaken in the mid-1980s, huge deficits
made it politically necessary to make it appear as though the
Treasury wouldn't lose revenue. One way to accomplish this was to
restrict AMT tax preferences. The effect of these restrictions has
spread to taxpayers of relatively ordinary means because the AMT
limits haven't been indexed to inflation. The total allowable
exemptions before the AMT kicks in, for instance, have been fixed
since 1993 at $45,000 for a married couple filing jointly.
</P>
<P>
   Klaassen is fighting, but most experts consider it a losing
fight because the law is clear. Thus, only Congress can undo the
injustice. Unfortunately, it seems in no hurry to do so.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andrea Urban was in the kitchen washing dishes when she heard
something strange. ``Suddenly there was this sound of splashing in
the living room,'' she said, ``and I thought, `Somebody's floating
through the house.''' Then it clicked. It was her husband, Glen. He
had shoved off on his inaugural swim in the lap pool.
</P>
<P>
   Most houses lead from front living room to back family room in a
gradient from formal to informal. At the Urbans new addition in
rural Massachusetts, however, Sheila Kennedy and Frano Violich of
the Boston architectural firm of Kennedy &AMP; Violich plunge visitors
into the life of the house: they have put the living back in the
living room.
</P>
<P>
   The architects radicalized the plan by placing front-and-center
the activity areas (including the pool) that are usually relegated
to the back rooms, basement and yard. Perhaps the Urbans are more
affluent than most, but the new configuration reflects changes in
the way many Americans live. By taking pool, exercise area, office
and an art gallery out of the margins and placing them center
stage, the architects are catching up with everyday reality.
</P>
<P>
   In the very wide world of conventional four-bedroom, three-bath
houses, the coexistence of gallery, office, pool, gym, music room
and living room under a big top represents no less than a big bang
in thinking about the home.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about the poker-faced facade of the house extension,
completed last summer, would strike anyone heading up the driveway
as conspicuously revolutionary: the classical proportions overcome
the avant-gardism implied by the unpainted zinc shingle cladding.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the front door, a 48-foot-long lap pool plies its way
past the furniture and continues into a windowed extension
cantilevered into the garden. A gracefully arched plywood ramp
swans over the pool on its path to a home office tucked into an
upper corner of the living room; an exercise space with a ballet
barre lies beyond the pool.
</P>
<P>
   The walls, under a faceted 17-foot ceiling, serve as a gallery
for the Urbans' art collection. The Urbans haven't gotten around to
buying sofas, but the piano is in place, already the centerpiece of
their musical soirees.
</P>
<P>
   The architects have mixed seemingly irreconcilable functions _ a
pool and a gallery _ in a new domestic landscape that collects
rather than separates the couple on their daily routines. This is a
big house in which husband and wife are not lost to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the Urbans found themselves empty nesting in
the traditional-style house they had built in 1970. The house no
longer suited their needs _ but not because they needed something
smaller once their two children had left. Their art collection,
which they started as a young couple, had expanded to bursting, and
they needed much more wall area, with space for long sight lines.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Urban, a dancer also devoted to yoga, needed an exercise
area. Urban, a business professor, consultant and an amateur
sculptor, wanted an all-year lap pool. Urban also wanted a
technically sophisticated office.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of them wished to feel exiled from the house, and from
each other, in compartmentalized rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The Urbans are active in the arts, and they treated the shaping
of their new addition as an artistic process. Even though they had
designed the old house, with double-height living room and gabled
ceiling, they hired architects for the new addition.
</P>
<P>
   The project revealed a subtext of two people moving into a
different phase of life. ``It was important that the addition not
simply reflect the old house but the challenges we were growing
into,'' Urban said. ``It had to be about what we were becoming and
would become. We wanted to make another step forward in our
development and creative outlook.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Urbans, remodeling their house was, in a sense, a way of
remodeling their lives. The design process became a metaphor for
two people in transition. They were molting into a larger shell.
``It was clear they didn't want the usual loft or a big box,''
Violich said.
</P>
<P>
   What intrigued the architects most, and finally broke open the
floor plan, was the Urbans' notion that their pool didn't have to
be set outside the main living spaces: it was the wild card that
dislodged the usual relationships in the layout and acted as a
magnet for additional functions the Urbans wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frano and I were interested in bringing the pool into the
gallery, because we saw it could have a double life,'' said Ms.
Kennedy, who is also an associate professor at the Harvard Graduate
School of Design. ``We thought the pool would also be a water piece
_ an art piece _ with surfaces that reflect light.'' They saw that
the pool would function as a wall _ ``because you couldn't walk
across it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So the architects performed surgery on the original house,
opening its side to draw out a narrow isthmus of space (now the
site of the piano) that connects to the addition. The architects
shaped the overall geometry by inverting the gable so that, from
the outside, the roof line takes on the topography of an angular
hill. A frosted glass trough in the new roof, at the center of the
addition, acts as a skylight over the pool and anchors the roof
planes that fly up to a band of clerestory windows around the
perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   The outside of the house changes character several times _
intimate around the back courtyard and monumental on the side where
the lap pool bursts through the wall. Inside, the roof looks like
an umbrella blown inside out by a gust of wind.
</P>
<P>
   While the addition roughly doubles the size of the house, it
nearly quadruples the wall space for paintings, from 600 square
feet to 2,200 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   To maximize wall space, the architects invented what they call
``near furniture'' _ small built-in pieces that incorporate
cabinets, air grills and lighting elements. The largest piece of
near furniture is in Urban's home office. As the bridge over the
pool descends into the office area, one side metamorphoses into
cabinets and desktop.
</P>
<P>
   The pool acts as a reflecting pond or, perhaps, a conceptual
water installation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pool changes the color of the light, and the play of the
light on the ripples reflects on the walls and makes the whole
space feel more alive,'' Mrs. Urban said. ``It changes all the
time, the natural light mixing with the artificial light, and all
of it reacting with the surfaces of the painting. We get surprising
moments.''
</P>
<P>
   To handle the dampness, the architects designed a glass pavilion
around the pool, with disappearing sliding doors that contain the
humidity when the pool is heated in the winter. The roof of the
pavilion contains a system of air ducts.
</P>
<P>
   Multiplying the functions in the space alters the experience of
viewing the paintings.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the pool that changes the experience most radically.
``You can see the artwork when you're in the water _ as though
you're swimming in a museum,'' Mrs. Urban said. ``And the water
reflects light on the art. I like that overlay. With the water by
my side, I feel its tranquillity as I'm looking at a work of art. I
enjoy just knowing it's there.''

HIGH COURT SHOWS IT'S SKEPTICAL ABOUT CALIFORNIA WELFARE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several U.S. Supreme Court justices on Wednesday
indicated they were skeptical about a 1997 California law that
would confer lower welfare benefits to newcomers than to more
established residents.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the law may violate the
constitutionally protected right to travel by setting up financial
roadblocks to migrating welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the genius of the United States,'' she said. ``People
can pick their states, and states can't pick their people.''
</P>
<P>
   After Congress passed its 1996 welfare reform law, California,
like 14 other states, redesigned its welfare system to pay new
residents who sign up for aid only as much as they would have
received in their former states. Newcomers could receive full
California benefits after one year of residency.
</P>
<P>
   California's welfare program is among the most generous, ranking
sixth among all 50 states in terms of individual welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   This means that the vast majority of newcomers would receive
less money than established residents. For example, California
would pay an established family of four $673 per month, but if that
family had recently arrived from Mississippi, for example, it would
receive $144 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Congress allowed the two-tier system to prevent states with
higher benefits from becoming ``welfare magnets'' that would
attract migrating poor people. If welfare migration were to happen,
lawmakers feared that states might engage in a ``race to the
bottom'' to lower their benefits and make themselves less
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This law blatantly treats new residents differently from other
residents and prevents citizens from freely choosing the state in
which they wish to live,'' Mark Rosenbaum, attorney for a group of
welfare recipients, told the justices Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum's clients, a woman and a family, sued the state in
1997 because they would have received lower welfare benefits under
the new law.
</P>
<P>
   The family, listed under the fictitious name the Roes, moved to
Long Beach, Calif., from Oklahoma qualified to $307 per month under
the new law compared to the in-state resident benefit of $565.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Anna Doe, moved to Los Angeles from Washington, D.C.,
when she was six months pregnant was slated to receive $330 per
month under the new law, compared to an in-state resident benefit
of $456.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. district judge ruled on April 1, 1997 that the new law
was unconstitutional. The court said the law penalized migration
between states in violation of the equal protection clause of the
14th Amendment. The next year, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in
a unanimous decision agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's decision, which is expected by July, could
force California to restructure its welfare program, the nation's
largest with about 2.6 million recipients and a $6 billion budget.
The decision also could impact other states that have enacted
similar laws under the 1996 welfare reform law passed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   During Wednesday's arguments before the high court, Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor pressed California Deputy Attorney General
Theodore Garelis to show why his state's law does not infringe on a
person's right to move to California.
</P>
<P>
   Garelis answered that while the law may ``impede'' migration to
California, it certainly does not prevent freedom of travel.
``People move for a host of reasons, with welfare benefits being
only one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the law does not ``hurt'' newcomers because they
do receive benefits and those payments increase to California
levels after a year. ``In the end, they're no worse off than if
they had stayed in their original state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A skeptical O'Connor replied: ``You'd be hard-pressed to tell a
family who must live on welfare that getting $300 a month instead
of $600 a month is not painful. This has grave consequences for
that family.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Ginsburg asked Garelis why California chose to reduce
welfare benefits of newcomers, while not lowering their
unemployment benefits or adjusting their taxes to the level of
their old states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there something special about welfare benefits that
distinguishes them from other kinds of benefits?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Garelis said the state felt lowering welfare benefits was ``the
best way to save money.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Anthony M. Kennedy and John Paul
Stevens also appeared skeptical about the California law.
</P>
<P>
   The only justice to show sympathy to Garelis was Antonin Scalia,
who noted that states often treat new residents or travelers
differently than established residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every state that I know of charges higher tuition in their
universities for out-of-state residents and doesn't give the
in-state tuition until they live in the state at least a year,'' he
said. He added that states also charge different fees for hunting
and fishing for non-residents.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration asked the court to send the case back
to lower courts to decide if the statute fully conforms to 1996
welfare law passed by Congress.

a brief of more than 100 pages in preparation for opening arguments
Thursday in the Senate impeachment trial. (Deans, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   OTHER IMPEACHMENT SIDEBARS
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-JURORS _ WASHINGTON _ Breakdown on various blocs among
the senators and who viewers should watch for: Northeast GOP
moderates targeted by Dems (Collins, Chaffee, Jeffords, Snowe) GOP
pragmatists (Lott, McConnell); hardliners, Senators facing
elections (and likely to keep a low profile), etc. (Foskett,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-BARR _ WAHINGTON _ Bob Barr's job as a House manager is
to persuade Senators to see the merits of the case against
President Clinton. But, in the weeks before the trial, Barr has
gone out of his way to insult these jurors, questioning both their
attention spans and backbone. (Carr, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-WORLD _ MOSCOW _ As opening arguments begin today(Jan.
14) in the Senate trial of American President Bill Clinton, is the
world still paying attention? Or are they growing more weary of
this saga than the American public? Developing. (Foreign staff, Cox
News Service).
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-TV _ You say you're tired of the Clinton scandal. You
can't stand to watch a second more. But watch you will. Ratings are
up across the board on CNN, MSNBC, Fox News Channel and more for
Clinton coverage. (Jubera, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-TVBOX _ Where to watch it, and what you'll see. (Jubera,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-CHABOT _ WASHINGTON _ When Ohio's Rep. Steve Chabot made
his living as a lawyer, he was the legal equivalent of the family
doctor. Advertised in the Yellow Pages, Chabot's one-man law office
handled cases across the legal spectrum from criminal defense to
divorce court. It was a mix of work Chabot categorizes under the
heading of ``whatever came in the door.'' But now, Chabot's legal
profile is about to rise. Just weeks into his third term in
Congress, this former elementary school teacher is part of the team
of prosecutors that on Thursday will begin presenting a case for
removing President Clinton from office. (Montgomery, Dayton Daily
News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   DISABLED-ADDICTS _ WASHINGTON _ Drunks and addicts can become
disabled. Disabled people can abuse alcohol or drugs. On Wednesday,
a federal panel of physicians and other professionals releases a
new ``treatment protocol'' _ advice to their peers on successful
methods of treating someone with this particularly frustrating
combination of symptoms. Recovering substance abusers who are
disabled will be there to comment. (Mollison, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   Cox photos for this story will be placed in the National folder

   FLYNT-TALKS _ DAYTON, Ohio _ It's easy to forget, I suppose, but
Larry Flynt is a former Daytonian, worked here for six years and
started the publication here that became Hustler magazine. In an
interview Wednesday, Flynt recalled his days in Dayton and
explained his motivation in investigating the pasts of prominent
Republicans. Asked if he feels more legitimate now, Flynt said no,
he's still a smut peddler. (Beyerlein, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   GINGRICH-DISTRICT _ATLANTA _Two non-residents of the 6th
Congressional District jump into the race to replace Newt Gingrich.
(Visser, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-D0LE-PRESIDENCY _ CONCORD, N.H. _ Years after other
potential GOP presidential candidates began campaigning in this
bellwether state, two noncampaigners have jumped way ahead of the
pack. In results that confirm speculation that noncandidate
Elizabeth Dole could provide the most serious challenge to
noncandidate George W. Bush, a Manchester TV station poll gives
Dole a slight edge among New Hampshire Republicans, but within the
margin of error. Bush and Dole both have said they are undecided on
a presidential candidacy. Dole got a bump in the polls last week
after she resigned as president of the American Red Cross.
Political leaders here expect them both to run. (Herman, Austin
American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   CLEAN-MARSH (developing) _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The federal
government helped craft Florida's $763 million Everglades cleanup
plan, but five years later the project still lacks a federal
permit. Now the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is offering a
permit, but it has all kinds of strings that South Florida water
managers and the sugar industry object to. Among them: super-strict
rules on how much polluting phosphorus the cleansed water may
contain. The feds say they'll relax the rules if research later
shows that the Everglades can take more phosphorus, but the growers
say they smell a trap. Meanwhile, environmental groups say the
strict rules are needed to keep the state and sugar from colluding
on a ``cleanup'' that leaves the Everglades polluted. Sugar growers
will urge the water managers today to either reject the permit or
seek big changes. (King, Palm Beach Post).
</P>
<P>
   PRAYERONAIR _ ATLANTA _Supporters of Conyers, Ga., visionary
Nancy Fowler are taking to the airways to get the whole world
praying for peace. In a monthly international telecast, backed
largely by Martin Folse, president of HTV of Houma, La., a free,
hour-long program now will be part of a daytime television lineup.
Fowler claim to have spoken to the Virgin Mary and thousands of
people have attended rallies at her farm.(Scott, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

Chiles Center for Healthy Mothers and Babies, and other charities.
Lawton Chiles, who died last month, pushed for the lawsuit while
governor of Florida. (Hiaasen, Palm Beach Post).

alternative schools; $48.6M for new prisons; $17.3M for juvenile
justice improvements and $83M for the first phase of a property tax
cut. (Mantius, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   WELFARE _ An Ohio Senator is taking Bob Taft to task over his
inaugural example of a welfare reform success story. Taft
highlighted the succes of a Dayton woman, Shannon Stavis, who went
from welfare to work with training at Miami Jacobs College. State
Sen. Fingerhut says under GOP sponsored welfare reform Stavis could
not have gotten her benefits while going to schools. (Jasper,

   FLA-DRUG-MOVIE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ While the students at
Lake Worth High School were being held to a strict ``Zero
Tolerance'' anti-drug policy last week, Palm Beach County's film
commission was unwittingly helping a low-budget film crew shoot a
comic drug deal in one of the school's bathrooms. ``Dave's Day
Out'' begins when Dave buys some marijuana in the bathroom. (Hayes,

<P>
   TIRED-MAILMAN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Maybe rain or sleet can't stop
postal workers _ but what if they're tired? A former mail carrier
has been charged with keeping and opening 30,383 letters and
packages, including 208 parcels _ and authorities are holding it
all as evidence until the case is closed. James S. Wynn, 54, faces
a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, is charged
in U.S. District Court in Dayton in a bill of information. (Hills,

   OHIO-SCHOOL-SNOWDAYS _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Local school officials can
expect a chilly reception if they go to the Ohio legislature

   TEXAS-BUDGET _ State spending would creep above the $90 billion
mark for 200-2001, under a budget plan proposed by legislative

considered the blueprint for the state budget, would increase
spending 3.8 percent overall and 6 percent in general fund
expenditures, which are those funded by taxes. (E;izondo, Austin

 &HT;    Actor portrays King with emotional power
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Clifton Powell says he was about 12 and
oblivious to the civil rights movement when he came home one night
in 1968 and found his father crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew something big had happened, cause my dad never cried.
He said, 'Dr. King has just been killed.' I was deeply into sports
and almost a teenager, and the civil rights movement just hadn't
registered on me. It didn't affect my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``But from that day, I started my education in the civil rights
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Powell is a part of that education for a new generation.
He's playin the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in the ``The Wonderful
World of Disney'' TV movie ``Selma, Lord, Selma'' (7 p.m. Sunday on
ABC).
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who starred in the short-lived Fox series ``South
Central,'' trimmed his moustache to match King's and studied old
footage to learn his speaking voice. ``I tried to get tapes of him
away from the crowd, just sitting with the SCLC or in the back room
meetings,'' he says during an interview at an ABC party for the
nation's TV critics meeting here. ``I wanted to capture his natural
voice, when he wasn't doing a sermon.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, filmed in Atlanta, Griffin, Ga., and Selma, Ala., in
Setpember and airing on the eve of King Day, also stars Yolanda
King, the late minister's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She plays a schoolteacher,'' Powell says. ``For one of my
sermons, she was sitting in the back of the church just listening.
After we finished I went to her and we both started crying. It was
so emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more emotional, Powell says, was re-enacting the march on
the Edmund Pettis Bridge and Bloody Sunday, milestones in the
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't imagine how Dr. King and those people faced any
of that. The feeling of walking up to those policemen and knowing
they're not going to really hit us is a lot more of a relief than
walking up there and knowing that you're going to get beat down. I
don't think I could have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's impeachment on TNT
</P>
<P>
   At noon Sunday, Turner Classic Movies will air the 1942 film
``Tennessee Johnson.'' It chronicles President Andrew Johnson's
impeachment hearings some 130 years ago. Van Heflin plays Johnson
with Lionel Barrymore portraying Sen. Thad Stevens.

HOME COLUMN: ADOPTED UNAWARES IN RED HOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RED HOOK, N.Y. _ We never talked to each other until the big
yellow dog showed up, lying like a sphinx under the goal posts of
the soccer field. ``Come over here, honey,'' Charlie Mae called,
only I didn't know her name then. To me, she was the jaunty woman
who walked the track every morning in a colorful headdress, a loose
skirt that came to her calves and red tights with Reeboks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come over here, girl,'' she said in a velvety voice. ``Aren't
you a pretty girl? Who could've dumped you?''
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway, the Great Pyrenees who drags me to the park every
morning, hardly gave the stray a second glance. It was Monday, and
two days' worth of picnickers had left a wealth of chicken bones in
the grass. His big black nose was working the ground like a metal
detector.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at those big ears,'' I said as we stared at the dog. One
ear stood up, the other flopped. She had a broad head and a big
pink nose, and squinty eyes. She looked like Miss Piggy. Mostly
Labrador, with some pit bull mixed in. Or maybe Akita.
</P>
<P>
   A little man in a hooded sweatshirt, who never said a word as he
did his morning crunches and knee bends with the discipline and
silence of a Buddhist monk, now walked onto the field with a Rite
Aid bag full of scraps, dumped them on the ground and spoke to the
dog in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hemingway was interested. The crunch of bones between
another dog's jaws was riveting.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway is not my dog. He belongs to the people I rent from,
but they don't have the time to exercise him. He's beautiful, all
white with big black liquid eyes and a big black nose. But he's a
work dog; he needs a farm to run on, a herd of sheep to tend. I
started to walk him every morning because I felt sorry for him, and
now, as soon as he hears my coffee grinder, he starts howling.
</P>
<P>
   Now he was watching this upstart eat pork chop bones as I and
the others tried to cajole her closer. She'd wag her whole body,
drawing her black lips back from her long white teeth in a worried
little crocodile smile. But she wouldn't budge.
</P>
<P>
   The man in the sweatshirt, who told us he was from Puerto Rico
and had just moved to Red Hook Houses, said he had seen a family
dump her here. ``They went to Florida,'' was all he said.
</P>
<P>
   It went on like that for a couple of weeks, as people brought
food and talked about who among us could adopt her (no one), or if
we knew anybody who could.
</P>
<P>
   One day a big Buick drove up on the grass, and a woman got out
with her own bag of scraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey,'' one of our band called out, ``that dog already had
two breakfasts!'' We felt a little proprietary by this time, almost
hostile, as the woman defiantly plopped some pancakes onto the
grass. It was obvious that this dog was not going to starve. But
winter was coming. And we worried about wild dogs, like the pit
bulls turned out of Red Hook Houses when the Housing Authority
ordered tenants to give up their dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen guys sic their pit bulls on her,'' a man had told me
one day as Hemingway and I left the park. ``She sleeps in that
empty lot over there.'' This man parks his van at the edge of the
field every morning and lets his three cocker spaniels run about as
he drinks his coffee. We'd never exchanged more than a nod before,
but there was something lovable about this big yellow dog with the
soft ears and gentle independence.
</P>
<P>
   One day at last, the dog (we called her Red for Red Hook)
trotted up to Hemingway and playfully bit his neck. Then she bowed,
rump up, paws down, inviting him to play. And the two of them
gamboled down the field as I let the leash out as far as I could,
while they leapt and gnawed and growled at each other. Once in a
while, Red would tug at the leash, as if to say, ``Let him off this
thing so we can have some real fun.''
</P>
<P>
   So Hemingway became the love object, and I started trying to
lead Red home, using Hemmie as bait. I also asked around to see if
anyone wanted a dog. I even rang some doorbells to show her off.
One friend fell in love with her, but then the friend's arthritis
flared up.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Red was loping after us as we walked down the streets.
But she would veer off when Hemingway and I got to our corner. I
tried to lure her through the front gate with chicken scraps, but
she would have none of it. So one morning I tried the Tom Sawyer
routine, feigning no interest in anyone helping to whitewash the
fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, Hemingway,'' I said, without a backward glance as I
left all the doors open to the backyard. It didn't work the first
time. But on the second try, I heard paws trotting down the
hallway. She bounded through the back door to leap on her lover
boy, and I slammed it shut.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, Red was ours, like it or not. I tried to give her
to an artist down the street whose little boy fell in love with
Red, but within half an hour she was at our gate. I took her back,
but she slipped away again in the pouring rain and sat by the front
door, barking, until we let her in.
</P>
<P>
   So now there are two dogs at our house on Dikeman Street. One
afternoon the neighborhood children married them in the backyard.
Hemingway wore a bow tie, Red a little skirt made of a shawl. The
two play-fight for hours on the deck, then flop down for a snooze,
head to head.
</P>
<P>
   I've remembered the comfort of dogs. They were my constant
companions when I was a child. As a young woman, I had a dog,
Molly, who knew me in some uncanny way. She was my spirit dog. I
think you get only one of those in your life, but I guess I'm ready
to love some others. I'd been waiting for that life in the country,
when I could work at home and let my dogs use a dog door.
</P>
<P>
   But two big dogs adopted me in the middle of my real life. It
isn't convenient. I don't have a lot of time. But living with me is
better than being mauled by a pit bull. And Hemingway is so much
calmer now, he reminds me of a man with slippers.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the weather is cold, they spend their nights with me,
and I love to hear them breathing as I drift off, peaceful and safe
with my pack.

NORM MACDONALD ISN'T IN IT FOR THE APPLAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ You get the feeling that Norm Macdonald
requires adult supervision, but that you wouldn't want the job.
</P>
<P>
   He's surely left behind a string of sputtering, red-faced
relatives, teachers, neighbors, bureaucrats, bosses and _ this we
know for sure _ network TV executives.
</P>
<P>
   Macdonald will listen, but with a crooked half smile that tells
you he thinks you're crazy, and then do exactly as he damn well
pleases.
</P>
<P>
   Don Ohlmeyer, a very large suit at NBC, tried to get Macdonald
to knuckle under and finally fired him, a year ago, from ``Saturday
Night Live.'' Ohlmeyer didn't like Macdonald's ``Weekend Update.''
Macdonald apparently didn't care what Ohlmeyer liked or didn't
like.
</P>
<P>
   So now Macdonald is rewarded with his own ABC prime-time comedy
series, ``The Norm Show,'' scheduled to premiere in March. He'll
play a social worker who _ surprise! _ can't abide rules and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I can fail upward all the way,'' Macdonald says of his
capacity to parlay apparent screwups into career advances.
</P>
<P>
   Getting fired made Macdonald instantly infamous, and a bit of a
hero, because of suspicions that Macdonald's O.J. Simpson jokes
were the real burrs for Ohlmeyer, a longtime friend and supporter
of Simpson's.
</P>
<P>
   ``This publicity did help me,'' Macdonald told critics during an
ABC interview session this week, ``because all publicity is good
publicity, as Hitler said.''
</P>
<P>
   But wasn't a network pink slip upsetting? Didn't Macdonald fear,
however fleetingly, that he'd somehow scuttled a career that began
in the stand-up comedy dens of eastern Canada?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I mean, I don't want to be maudlin or anything,'' he
said, ``but my dad, when I was a young boy, told me that, you know,
life would not always be easy, and God knows he had hard times. And
he said that in times of trouble, you should drink a lot of
whiskey.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Macdonald slouched back in his chair, hands on his
knees, and waited for the silence to be broken by laughter. It took
a long five-count.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Macdonald eventually added, he has nothing against
Ohlmeyer, NBC's soon-to-depart West Coast president. He doubts that
his firing was due to ``the O.J. thing'' and agrees that his
``Weekend Update'' segments weren't ``an audience-pleasing, warm
kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did jokes that I knew weren't going to get big reactions,''
Macdonald said. ``I think he just, his thing to me was always like,
`Hey, Jay (Leno) goes out there every night and kills with his
monologues, and they applaud constantly, and you don't, even though
you only have to do it one night a week.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So I saw his point, you know. But I wasn't trying to please
the audience. So I can understand from a businessman that why the
f_ would you want some dude not trying to please the audience?''
</P>
<P>
   Radical thought, but isn't pleasing the audience the point of
show business?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I just try to, like, please my buddies and myself,''
Macdonald said. ``I know that you can do certain jokes, like I know
on `Update' oftentimes people would offer jokes to me, the idea
being like, you know, Newt Gingrich being a Nazi or something.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I knew that the audience would applaud that, but I never
thought Newt Gingrich was a Nazi. I hate doing jokes where people
applaud, you know? Because they're not laughing, you know what I
mean?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the thing. I loved Johnny Carson when he would do a
joke and when the joke didn't work, he would backtrack. That was
always very funny. Like he'd go, `Ahhh, I guess that one ...'
That's my Carson impression. And it seemed like everybody tried to
do that afterward. In other words, you'd do the joke, then if it
doesn't work, you're embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling always was, I like the f_ joke. And so if the
audience doesn't laugh, that doesn't mean (set ital)I'm(end ital)
wrong. It means (set ital)they're(end ital) wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the audience couldn't possibly have been more
wrong about ``Dirty Work,'' a feature film Macdonald co-wrote and
starred in last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the audience not laugh, it didn't even get within
chuckle distance of the theaters where ``Dirty Work'' was playing.
</P>
<P>
   So of course Macdonald was asked about that particular exercise
in cinematic futility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they put the movie out in the summer against
blockbusters,'' he said. ``Some people have told me that's the
reason.
</P>
<P>
   He paused a beat and added, ``Some people say that the film is
just f_ horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, that would be their fault.

KING'S FAMILY WANTS HOLIDAY TO BE ABOUT HELPING OTHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSAMY BROWN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Independence Day, families watch fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Thanksgiving is a turkey and football gorgefest.
</P>
<P>
   But what to do on Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, an American
holiday so new that there aren't widespread traditions?
</P>
<P>
   During his life, King led the movement for civil rights for
African-Americans and equality for all. So his family wants the
holiday honoring him to be more than a day off from work or school.
They are promoting the annual event as a national day of service,
on which people do hands-on things to help others.
</P>
<P>
   ``People working together and getting to know each other, that's
improving the quality of relationships among people. People working
together learn to respect each other,'' Coretta Scott King, 71, the
Baptist minister's widow, said in a telephone interview. ``To
improve race relations starts with relationships among people. We
have to work at it. It's not going to happen by itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King Jr. was born Jan. 15, 1929, in Atlanta and
assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn., where he was
leading a strike of sanitation workers. President Reagan in 1983
signed papers making the third Monday in January a holiday for
remembering King and honoring his legacy. The nation's first
observance of King Day was in January 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Coretta Scott King suggests that Americans take an hour or two
to read to an elderly person or go grocery shopping for invalids.
Schools need painting and voters need registering, she said last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site for the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for
Nonviolent Social Change (www.thekingcenter.com) suggests that
people donate books about King, civil rights and black history to
prisons, nursing homes or halfway houses. Planting a tree and
flying the U.S. flag are two additional ways to honor what King
stood for.
</P>
<P>
   Dexter King, 37, one of King's four children, said the holiday
should not be thought of as only for blacks, but as a celebration
of America's diversity and pledge to equality among people.
</P>
<P>
   King's message is universal, his son said, and the civil-rights
movement was subsequently used as a basis for the anti-Vietnam War
effort, the women's movement and the gay-rights movement in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I am challenging America to be its best self, to
live up to the statement in the Constitution that all men are
created equal.' He said we have an obligation to live up to the
commitment that we've made to ourselves,'' said Dexter King,
president of the King Center in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Although much has changed since the 1960s, there's still work to
be done to achieve the goal of becoming a ``harmonious society,''
Coretta Scott King said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosa Parks didn't organize a committee,'' she said, referring
to the seamstress who inspired the 1955 Montgomery, Ala., bus
boycott by refusing to give up her bus seat to a white rider, as
was required. ``If she had, we might still be arguing about how to
get things done. One person can make a difference.''

THE VENERABLE CBS NEWSMAGAZINE JOINS A CROWDED FIELD _ AND RAISES
EYEBROWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Word is that Don Hewitt, patriarch and
longtime producer of ``60 Minutes,'' is still miffed over this ``60
Minutes II,'' which made its debut Tuesday night. Hewitt's
aggravation, in fact, is receiving sound-bite treatment courtesy of
``60 Minutes II'' Executive Producer Jeff Fager, who is sharing the
story about arriving his first day and finding a note from Hewitt
attached to his door.
</P>
<P>
   It read: ``It's 6 a.m. I'm here. Where the &AMP;% are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Notes Fager: ``I think Don was still very nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, who isn't? Though the CBS brass insist that Hewitt has
given his blessing, ``60 Minutes'' veteran correspondent Mike
Wallace has repeatedly expressed that he thinks it's a lousy idea
for the highly distinguished newsmagazine to birth an offspring and
fall in line with the lesser shows such as ``Dateline NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   I can see the competitive, cranky Wallace growling something
about the selling of journalistic souls and jeopardizing
credibility and integrity just to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Me? I simply find it gutsy for a network to dive headfirst into
a pool that's already being sucked bone-dry.
</P>
<P>
   Joining ``60 Minutes II'' next month will be a third edition of
ABC's ``20/20,'' plus a prime-time hour tentatively titled ``ABC
News Thursday.'' This will bring to 15 the number of hours on the
networks and cable, which is far more than any human should be
expected to digest, unless, of course, such viewing is used as a
torture tactic.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings, most of them heading south this year, seem to bear
out saturation levels. But the networks insist that viewers aren't
losing interest in the newsmags but in the ratings-challenged
sitcoms that are lead-ins. And besides, overall viewing on network
TV is down, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, the largest audience exodus has been from ``Dateline
NBC,'' the format's leader with five installments a week.
Viewership is down for all except the Wednesday edition.
</P>
<P>
   Is it time to stop the newsmag madness? Those running the
networks think not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying that there are too many newsmagazines was the same as
saying that there were too many talk shows before Ricki Lake
entered the group,'' says Susanne Daniels, president of
entertainment at The WB. ``What \Rcreators\S did so well with Ricki
Lake was take a new twist on an old talk format. That can be done
with newsmagazines. There's always room for that in television.''
</P>
<P>
   The scary thought is that at least three networks seem to be
moving inexorably toward a daily prime-time news hour, which would
merely combine an evening news-style wrap-up of the day's events
with the usual shopworn stories and consumer scare-tactic pieces.
Like when a ``Dateline'' story on trucking called America's
highways ``a trucker's killing fields!''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has spent much time watching newsmagazines knows how
unoriginal the stories are. Good investigative reporting takes time
_ something your average magazine show doesn't have.
</P>
<P>
   The growing problem, though, is that because they compete in the
entertainment milieu, these shows must acquire certain aspects of
entertainment programming. They have ``stars'' (Jane Pauley and
Stone Phillips, Diane Sawyer and Hugh Downs, Barbara Walters and
Sam Donaldson, Katie Couric and Maria Shriver), titillation in the
form of hidden cameras, and hype in the form of enticing on-air
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Many segments are merely re-examinations of earlier stories or
pieces plucked out of some print magazine or newspaper, often
tabloidy in nature.
</P>
<P>
   One producer who didn't want his name or affiliation used said
that network executives even request minute-by-minute ratings on
newsmagazines, so it is known not only which stories entice
viewers, but also which aspects of those stories get their hearts
racing.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``60 Minutes II,'' well, it's here for the same reasons
that NBC has stuck ``Dateline'' under a copy machine. Newsmagazines
have in the past been extremely profitable, earning dependable
Nielsen ratings in almost any prime-time hour.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has learned _ and this was Hewitt's point early on _ that
it's easier to stick in a ``Dateline'' than to find another
``Seinfeld'' or ``ER,'' which is costing the network a small
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Moonves, president of CBS Television, argued vigorously
for ``60 Minutes II'' on the notion that finding dramas hasn't been
the problem _ getting people to watch them has.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why newsmagazines are easy picks,'' he says. ``They
cost half the amount of money. And it's easy to sell. Look at NBC.
``Trinity'' goes off the air and they put ``Dateline'' in there.
Nice fix. Easy fix. You know it's a solid performer. Problem
solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Moonves would rather not see a TV universe filled
with newsmagazines, ``New dramas are difficult to launch. Our two
highest-rated new shows are ``L.A. Doctors'' and ``Martial Law.''
Neither one of them is knocking down the world yet.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say whether ``60 Minutes II'' will, either.
Correspondents Bob Simon and Dan Rather'' are familiar faces.
Charlie Rose is the acerbic late-night host with a reputation for
being a disarming questioner; Vicki Mabrey and Carol Marin are
lesser-known, but are considered smart reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``60 Minutes II'' plans to follow the same ``60 Minutes''
format: three stories, an occasional commentary, letters segments,
and the familiar ticking clock.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with TV critics over the weekend, Moonves tried his best
to separate ``60 Minutes II'' from what producer Dick Wolf ``(Law &AMP;
Order)'' calls cookie-cutter television and ``the enemy of
dramas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there should be a balance between comedy, between
news, between movies,'' he said. ``And have they overdone it, some
of our competitors? Possibly.'' But not CBS, even though a ``48
Hours'' offspring is also rumored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to duplicate the best traditions, the
highest-quality storytelling, the highest- quality interviewing,
the best stories, week in and week out,'' says Fager. ``And we'll
do that with an A-team of broadcast journalists both on and off the
air. I don't see how anyone can object to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The only objection so far has been to one of the show's
commentators, comedian Jimmy Tingle. Fager calls him ``sharp'' and
``opinionated.''
</P>
<P>
   He's more than that. A comic on a ``60 Minutes'' franchise is
yet another example of how news and entertainment have become
basically one and the same.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Treacherous traveling conditions Thursday will prevail from
southern New England across the central Appalachians to the eastern
Ohio Valley, where a combination of snow, sleet and freezing rain
will fall. A series of disturbances will cause mild, moist air to
rise as it encounters a mound of Arctic air centered over eastern
Canada. Periods of snow will occur though midday from northern Ohio
to southern New England. The cold air will gradually be eroded
causing the snow to mix with sleet and freezing rain later in the
day. Milder air from the ocean will cause the mixed precipitation
to eventually change to rain near the coast. Sleet and freezing
rain will be persistent in the central Appalachians resulting in an
accumulation of ice, some of which will cling to trees and power
lines. Farther south, rain will dampen most areas near the Middle
Atlantic Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and showers will be scattered ahead of a cold front as it
moves through the Southeastern States. A few stronger thunderstorms
will develop near the Gulf Coast as increasingly humid air moves
north ahead of the front. Clouds and cool breezes will linger
behind the front in the lower Mississippi Valley. Farther west,
partly to mostly sunny skies will develop over the southern Plains
although it will be cooler than recently.
</P>
<P>
   A front in the Dakotas will separate cold air and snow showers
over the Great Lakes and northern Mississippi Valley from much
milder air and gusty winds in the northern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Rain will accompany a front in the Pacific Northwest. Meanwhile,
the Southwestern States will remain dry.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Understanding Ice
</P>
<P>
   An icy mixture will fall in much of the Northeast on Thursday.
Nearly all winter precipitation starts as snow 10 to 20 thousand
feet above the ground. The type of precipitation that reaches the
ground is determined during the last 5,000 feet of descent.
Sometimes a warm layer aloft will melt the snowflake before
reaching the ground. If a shallow layer of subfreezing air is
present at the surface, the raindrop freezes on contact, producing
the glaze condition called freezing rain. A deeper layer of cold
air will cause the drop to freeze into a pellet of ice known as
sleet.

CLAY FEAT: DESIGNER IS TILE STYLE GURU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Name a linoleum designer. How about an artist known for
cabinets, faucets or floors? No? It's understandable. In those
trades, most of the creative people labor in obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   The tile industry, though, has a star. Her name is Ann Sacks,
and she is bringing her exquisite tiles to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After the International Home Builders Show closes Jan. 17, the
Ann Sacks Tile &AMP; Stone store and showroom will open to the public
in Dallas' Design District. In an enclave of brick fortresses
hiding their precious contents from public view, Sacks'
glass-walled space is as open and enticing as a chest full of
jewels. It stands out.
</P>
<P>
   Her work always does. Sacks manipulates tile as fashion
designer, architect, engineer and archaeologist. She includes
stone, metals and glass in her mosaic palette.
</P>
<P>
   Sacks makes narrow, heavily textured tiles to border walls,
reminiscent of boucle trim on a Chanel jacket. On a floor of huge,
matte-glazed tiles, she embeds brilliant little pieces of glass
that look like jeweled buttons on gray velvet.
</P>
<P>
   She shakes free of the traditional 4-inch-square boundaries. Her
tiles are large, larger _ and minuscule. They are rectangular like
shoe boxes, or interlocking odd shapes resembling an M.C. Escher
background. They are thick, thin, heavily textured or as slick and
reflective as a mirror. They are glazed with the intense hues of
semiprecious stones or mottled with a multitude of earth colors.
</P>
<P>
   Sacks tiles entire rooms. She makes border tiles that look like
baseboards and then turns them upside down, places them at the top
of the wall and turns them into crown molding.
</P>
<P>
   She buys old terra-cotta tiles from houses and barns that are
being demolished in France. The barn tiles _ flat terra-cotta
rectangles that have a concave surface _ were used inside the barn
roofs. The six-sided kitchen tiles have seen decades of wear and
wine spills and are all the more beautiful for their nicks and
stains.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come here covered with mold, dirt and pieces of mortar,
and you can see the history in them,'' Sacks says reverently.
</P>
<P>
   She saves stones from ancient buildings in Israel. The crude
limestone blocks with their rough-hewn surfaces are carefully
numbered, registered and shipped to Sacks. She calls the
centuries-old building blocks her biblical stones and sells them
for $48 a square foot. She is dunned an additional export tax
because they are antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   A more affordable limestone look can be found on the back wall
of the Sacks showroom. What looks like Texas Hill Country limestone
isn't natural at all. The synthetic material is called Jacques
Rocks, and it can be put up right over Sheetrock without any other
supporting subsurface. It sells for $7 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   The price range in the various lines is extreme, from a few
dollars to $250 a square foot. When faced with a tight budget,
Sacks recommends using more tile in a lower price range. She likes
to see rooms covered in tile, at least one entire wall and the
floor. She covered her kitchen in rectangular white tiles that are
priced at $4 a square foot. The more tile, the more stunning the
effect, she maintains.
</P>
<P>
   Sacks took a winding course to find her calling, even though the
big sign, the neon light of awareness, presented itself to her in a
Mexican shower stall when she was 13.
</P>
<P>
   She was on a family vacation at a resort in Mexico, and the bath
area was covered in Talavera tiles. The blue, green and gold colors
and hand-painted organic design fused to her memory. It was an
epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still remember walking into that shower,'' Sacks says as
she closes her eyes to conjure up the vision that has stayed with
her for years.
</P>
<P>
   At 13, epiphanies, hormonal surges and the stress of family
vacations can be confusing. Whatever the reason, Sacks finished her
education with a degree in English literature and a fall-back
position in education. She accumulated a husband, children and
experience as a teacher and social worker.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, just when her life seemed on a predictable trajectory,
Talavera tiles made another appearance, this time in a Portland
gift shop. They had been backed with felt and were displayed next
to the cash register, to encourage an impulse buy. It worked. Sacks
bought them all and ordered more.
</P>
<P>
   She began importing large terra-cotta tiles and brilliant
Talaveras from Mexico. She tiled entire rooms in her house. She
covered her tables, then began tiling her husband's office. She
became the source for Mexican tiles in the Pacific Northwest. Her
home was her showroom. Soon she was manufacturing tiles of her own
design.
</P>
<P>
   She quizzed a few designers. ``If I could do with tile what you
can get with Formica, would you be interested?'' The answer was an
emphatic ``yes.'' That was all she needed to jump-start her custom
collection.
</P>
<P>
   At first, her name would appear in small print buried in the
resource list within the glossy magazines. If a bathroom or kitchen
was so extraordinary that a reader was compelled to wade through
the interminable where-to-buy section, her name inevitably
appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, the name Ann Sacks Tile &AMP; Stone began
appearing under the photos, like that of a furniture designer. She
had a signature, a look. She was a name.
</P>
<P>
   The giant Kohler company, makers of sinks, tubs and fixtures,
bought her business in 1989. There are now eight showrooms, with
the one in Dallas and one other opening in '99. The company employs
more than 100 people, 30 of whom are artists, in seven states.
</P>
<P>
   Rizzoli, publisher of fine art books, recognizes her special
place in the design pantheon and is releasing a book about Ann
Sacks and her tiles this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to see her work, though, is to visit her store. You
can't miss it. It's the shining beacon of color and light one block
south of Stemmons Freeway on Oak Lawn Avenue.

FORT WORTH, Texas: that are available. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And that's going to be serendipitous because of what comes
available or can be made to come available. So, here, I am not
focused on identifying gaps in the collection, which is very
different from Melbourne. In Melbourne, the collection was much
larger, and we did look for gaps that could be feasibly filled.
</P>
<P>
   Here, if we go for 20 years without buying a piece of European
sculpture, that's fine. If nothing is good enough, you wait until
the outstanding thing comes along. And, if there are wonderful
things in Asian art, 20 things in the next 10 years, then let's get
all 20 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about blockbuster shows?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually, that's a term I don't like. Because it has acquired
all sorts of bad connotations, and I think rightly so. What I like
to do is present good exhibitions, some of which will be big, which
the press will call ``blockbusters,'' and some of which will be
small and just as good and won't be called blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   The aim always is to do the very finest exhibition of that
artist or subject or period that can be done at a certain time. ...
My experience has been that, if you focus on that core issue of
quality, the rest of the problems directors are forced to worry
about _ attendance, financial liability and so on _ do, in a way,
take care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   If you put people in front of really great art and explain what
is important, by and large you get a really positive response. You
can put wonderful works together but, if they're from an exotic
culture and you don't explain them, people may be perplexed and
walk away feeling that they've had a great experience but it really
didn't mean anything to them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about the idea that really great works don't need that
verbal support?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, there's an enormous amount of art historical knowledge
that art professionals bring to an exhibition that we all take for
granted. But it is a specialist's knowledge that most people don't
have. So it's not condescending in any way to say that people need
and want to be told what is interesting about the object in front
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And that does justice to the object and the culture that
created it, as well. What about other exhibitions coming up, apart
from ``Matisse and Picasso''? I know there's an Egyptian faience
show.
</P>
<P>
   A: The schedule that was in place when I arrived had ``Matisse
and Picasso'' and faience the first half of the year, and the
permanent collection the second half. It might as well stay that
way, and it certainly won't worry me if it does.
</P>
<P>
   Most exhibitions of real substance that are already curated
somewhere else take more than a year to put together. So I'm not
about to scramble to find things to fill the gap. Because we don't
need to: The permanent collection is an important priority. So my
plans are focused on the years after 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So is there anything planned for the millennium?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are lots of things milling around. But it's too soon to
say. I'm not being coy. It's just too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about working in the Unites States? When you still were
in Melbourne and we talked on the phone, you said you were looking
forward to working here because of some positive differences.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's very different. The private foundation support of a
museum like this and _ on a very straightforward level, the
relative lack of bureaucracy and unnecessary paperwork _ is a
delightful change from a public institution.
</P>
<P>
   Here, all the focus is on actually achieving the result.
Everything is determined by wanting to acquire the best work of
art, by wanting to put together the best possible exhibition. The
very senior people are focused on achieving the core mission of the
institution, and are very happy to talk about how to make it
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Speaking of here, how do you find Fort Worth?
</P>
<P>
   A: People told me I would find Fort Worth very hospitable and
welcoming, and that's been absolutely true. My family and I have
been overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Any difficulty at all adjusting?
</P>
<P>
   A: Practically speaking, it's still a bit chaotic at home. And,
you know, you get used to a certain kind of espresso coffee. The
hardest thing about coming here has been getting a strong cup of
coffee that isn't a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What would be the most fun thing you've done since you got
here?
</P>
<P>
   A: I haven't asked myself that in quite those terms. But my
greatest sense of anticipation was to go through the vaults and
discover all the things I didn't know about or hadn't seen in
person before. Some of the antiquities. Some of the Old Masters.
And some of the pieces where it's not clear who the artist is _
famous ones like the La Tour ``Saint Sebastian.'' That has been
very exciting.

NEW KIMBELL DIRECTOR TIMOTHY POTTS TALKS IN WIDE-RANGING INTERVIEW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Oxford graduate, archaeologist, art
historian, husband and father, former art critic and financier,
semi-frustrated espresso drinker and new director of the Kimbell
Art Museum, Timothy Potts, 40, has been a busy man since his
arrival in Fort Worth in November.
</P>
<P>
   He's still settling into his new job as head of a small,
relatively new, privately operated museum _ quite a change from
Australia's big old public National Gallery of Victoria, which he
directed for three years. But, as this first interview with him
indicates, Potts has a clear appreciation of what the Kimbell is
and can be.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: You've arrived at the Kimbell in the midst of
preparation for ``Matisse and Picasso.'' But what are some of the
other things you're addressing daily and weekly for now?
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: Well, there are things that go under the heading of
management: security arrangements, planning on how we'll rehang the
permanent collection during ``Matisse and Picasso.''
</P>
<P>
   But I said when I came here that I wanted to take time to get to
know the institution. I spent the time before Christmas getting to
know the staff. With the new year, I'll be talking with them about
issues and, in four or five months, I'll be coming out with a clear
plan for what I want to do.
</P>
<P>
   Still, certain things already are jelling in my mind.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Such as?
</P>
<P>
   A: One is getting the collection, which is small and of high
quality, fully cataloged and in the form of digitized images, and
getting it online. There's no reason why it can't all be online.
Other museums are doing this, but they have 10- or 15-year
timetables, because they've got hundreds of thousands of objects.
We have a few hundred objects and can achieve that in a much
shorter space of time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about the idea of a new, hard-copy publication of works,
as well?
</P>
<P>
   A: Publications is another area we are looking at. ``In Pursuit
of Quality'' came out in 1987, and we've continued to collect so
much that there is a lot of new material. But each decade, any
institution needs to stand back and rethink what visitors want to
know and the best way of presenting it to them. ... But I'm still
for the handbook. So we will be doing a new edition.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you thought about using the property across the street
that the foundation acquired last year?
</P>
<P>
   A: We haven't set a timetable for a decision on use of the new
site. In due course, we'll consider how we might use it to enhance
our current facilities. But anything we consider will be based on a
commitment to preserving and making optimum use of the Kimbell's
collections and its world-renowned Louis Kahn building.
</P>
<P>
   Q: This may be a bit soon to ask, but have you found a favorite
piece of art yet in the collection?
</P>
<P>
   A: (laughs) It's hard to avoid that question, isn't it? It's
funny, the only time you ever stop and think about it is when
you're asked by someone doing an article. But here is what might be
a cryptic response and a long-winded one.
</P>
<P>
   The sense in which you have favorites changes, I have found.
It's not a favorite in the sense of a collector who might want to
have that picture at home or over the mantelpiece. It is what is
uppermost in your mind. It's the work you're most interested in at
the moment. And the work you're most interested in often is
something you find fascinating because you know very little about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Often it's what you've most recently acquired. Because I'm new
here, my favorite work is the latest surprise in the vaults. That's
the sort of stage I'm at. You ask me this question a year from now,
and I'll give you a very different answer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about the antiquities collection here? With your
background in antiquities and archaeological research, do you think
more things will be coming into that collection?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, the antiquities are not the most distinguished
collection in the Kimbell. There are a handful of good pieces, and
there's certainly scope for improvement. And I bring some expertise
in that area. So there's that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But it's never been my practice to focus the collections of the
institution on what I know about or am most interested in. What you
enjoy the most is building a collection as a collection and not
just an assemblage of objects, looking at the balance and overall
direction of it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you address the balance of the Kimbell's collection or
its direction?
</P>
<P>
   A: Let me answer that in general terms, because the Kimbell has
never been a comprehensive collection. Nor should it be. During the
decades it's been collecting, there have been artists and
categories of art where the sort of quality you want just wasn't
available. So the Kimbell has tried to collect across a broad range
of areas ... and go for absolutely the supreme objects that are
available.

 PARTISAN POLITICS LEADS TO ABUSE OF IMPEACHMENT CLAUSES  (EDITOR'S
NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the Casper
(Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First Amendment
commentary. His e-mail address is levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)  By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY    
 c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The impeachment process which has entangled President Clinton
and the Congress is full of quirks and oddities that point to the
fierce partisanship that is driving this spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has been sworn in as jurors for the president's
impeachment trial. However, three newly elected senators will have
the privilege of voting twice on the impeachment of the president _
they were representatives in the 105th Congress. The double-vote is
comparable to the member of a grand jury voting to indict a person
and then in a trial voting on his guilt or innocence. They have
become both accusers and jury. This is one reason that the 106th
Congress should have begun the process all over again from the
start and dropped the articles of impeachment as passed by the U.S.
House in the 105th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three new senators voted to impeach Clinton when they
were in the House: Jim Bunning, R-Ky., and Michael Crapo, R-Idaho.
The other freshman senator, Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., voted against
impeachment. To be fair _ if the Senate were actually seeking
fairness, these senators should not be allowed to vote on whether
the president is guilty of the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   If only 97 members of the Senate can vote, it would take 65
votes to bring the president down. It would still require 12
Democrats to vote guilty on one of the two articles of impeachment
_ nevertheless, the process would preserve some notion of fairness.
</P>
<P>
   When President Nixon was facing possible impeachment, the
Democratic-controlled House Judiciary Committee appointed an
impeachment inquiry staff to define the nature of an impeachable
offense. The staff, which ironically included attorney Hillary
Rodham before she was married to Bill Clinton, placed impeachable
offenses for a president at a high threshold _ as envisioned by the
framers of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The staff submitted a memo to the committee that stated in part:
</P>
<P>
   `Because impeachment of a President is a grave step for the
nation, it is to be predicated only upon conduct seriously
incompatible with either the constitutional form and principles of
our government or the proper performance of constitutional duties
of the presidential office.` To be impeached, a president must have
acted to subvert the structure of our democracy.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that some of Nixon's actions surpassed the threshold
of impeachable offenses and were, indeed, `seriously incompatible
with the constitutional form and principles of our government.` The
break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters as an
act of political espionage and subsequent attempts to cover up this
and other covert activities did jeopardize our democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee in the 105th Congress, however,
sought no standard for an impeachable offense. They flew into
impeachment by the seat of their partisan pants. The
Republican-controlled committee knew an impeachable offense when
they saw one _ whether they could define it or not.
</P>
<P>
   During the Constitutional Convention in 1787, James Madison
spoke to the issue of impeaching a president. According to his
notes on the convention, Madison said that impeachment should be
used when a president embezzles money or oppresses the people or
`might betray his trust to foreign powers.`
</P>
<P>
   In `The Federalist Papers,` No. 65, Alexander Hamilton explained
and defended the Constitution's provisions on impeachment. He
considered impeachment appropriate when a president violates the
public trust or damages society. Nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   The framers of the Constitution were worried about Congress
abusing its impeachment powers, so they set the impeachment
standard for presidents at a high level. The standard they set for
the impeachment of a president is much higher than the two articles
of impeachment facing Clinton. The real culprit here is partisan
politics.
</P>
<P>
   When former special prosecutors Archibald Cox and Leon Jaworski
conducted their investigations of then-President Nixon, they
avoided partisan politics. And when they presented the House
Judiciary Committee with their report, they simply provided the
results of their investigations. They did not lobby for
impeachment. In stark contrast, special prosecutor Kenneth Starr,
whose office leaked grand jury testimony that was damaging to the
president, was a shameless advocate of impeachment when he
testified before the judiciary committee. His actions caused
Starr's ethics adviser Sam Dash to resign in protest.
</P>
<P>
   The standard for the impeachment of judges is not as high as the
constitutional standard set for the impeachment of presidents. The
impeachment clause in the Constitution that pertains to judges
states that judges `shall hold their offices during good behavior.`
The constitutional standard for the impeachment of a president is
`treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.`
</P>
<P>
   There is good reason for the difference. Judges are appointed,
but presidents hold office after winning a national election, after
a majority of American citizens across the country have voted for
the candidate. Only the gravest betrayal on the part of a president
can be an excuse to nullify an election.
</P>
<P>
   Judges can be and have been removed for committing perjury. Even
if Clinton committed perjury in his testimony to the grand jury
about sex with Monica Lewinsky, that action alone does not
jeopardize our nation. Lying about a sexual liaison does not
violate the public trust. The affair itself violated a marital
trust --- important to the family, but not a national crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The high standard of impeachment for a president does not put a
president above the law, as some claim. If, indeed, Clinton lied,
he can be prosecuted when his term of office is over.
</P>
<P>
   Critics claim that Paula Jones did not receive justice because
of Clinton's alleged false testimony. Nonsense. Jones had her day
in court. Judge Susan Webber Wright dismissed her lawsuit, saying
that even if her allegations were true, there weren't grounds to
sue. The judge also ruled that Clinton's testimony in regard to
Monica Lewinsky was irrelevant to the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate convicts Clinton on either of the two articles of
impeachment, Congress will have toppled a president by the abuse of
its powers. And Americans will have a lot more to worry about than
sex in the White House.

AS TRIAL BEGINS, COLLECTORS SCOUR FOR A PIECE OF HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Senate trial of President Clinton gets under
way Thursday, memorabilia collectors are scouring for keepsakes in
the first impeachment trial of a president in 131 years.
</P>
<P>
   Serious collectors already are bombarding dealers with requests
to purchase the tickets that will be handed out each day to members
of the public viewing the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got about 20 people who want to buy them, but I have
nobody who has offered them for sale,'' lamented Nelson Whitman,
owner of Capitol Coin &AMP; Stamp Co. in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, 50 seats in the 596-seat Senate gallery will
be made available each day to members of the public.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said that depending upon the length of the trial, the
tickets might be worth $50 to $100 to collectors. A shorter trial
likely would increase the value of the Clinton tickets because
fewer would be in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   A ticket to the only other impeachment trial of a president,
that of Andrew Johnson in 1868, sells for around $250.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Ross, a Washington attorney and president of the Clinton
Political Item Collectors club, is anticipating a small number of
Clinton tickets making it to the collectibles marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to be the sleepers,'' Ross predicted. ``A lot
of the Senate offices have asked people to hand them back at the
end of the day. One Senate office even requests a driver's license
in collateral.''
</P>
<P>
   Collectors in search of impeachment paraphernalia are sticklers
for nuance and oddities. For example, Ross noted that the Clinton
trial tickets are more true to the impeachment process than are the
Johnson tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson-era tickets admitted an individual to witness from
the Senate gallery the ``Impeachment of the President,'' which is
technically incorrect, since the Constitution requires the House to
vote articles of impeachment, then for the Senate to act as a court
to consider the charges. (The Senate acquitted Johnson by one vote
in 1868.)
</P>
<P>
   But the modern tickets admit a person to view ``The Impeachment
Trial of the President of the United States,'' which is the
appropriate phase for the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors are hoping that unique items associated with the
impeachment in the House and the trial in the Senate eventually
appear on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Levine, of Presidential Coin &AMP; Antique Co. in Alexandria,
Va., said that the pens used by senators to sign an oath book last
week officially opening the impeachment trial will be much sought
after.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they won't be of any value unless they are accompanied by
an authenticating letter from a senator saying they were used to
sign the book,'' Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   John Loring, a Chicago attorney and political memorabilia
enthusiast, said aficionados are on the lookout for items such as
signed note cards used by senators during the trial or copies of
the Congressional Record, the daily transcription of congressional
activity, signed by major players like House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., or Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawmakers have recognized the historic dimensions of the
impeachment activity and have begun their own collections.

AS TRIAL BEGINS, COLLECTORS SCOUR FOR A PIECE OF HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the Senate trial of President Clinton getting
under way Thursday, memorabilia collectors are scouring for
keepsakes in the first impeachment trial of a president in 131
years.
</P>
<P>
   Serious collectors already are bombarding dealers with requests
to purchase the tickets that will be handed out each day to members
of the public viewing the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got about 20 people who want to buy them, but I have
nobody who has offered them for sale,'' lamented Nelson Whitman,
owner of Capitol Coin &AMP; Stamp Co. in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, 50 seats in the 596-seat Senate gallery will
be made available each day to members of the public.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said that depending upon the length of the trial, the
tickets might be worth $50 to $100 to collectors. A shorter trial
likely would increase the value of the Clinton tickets because
fewer would be in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   A ticket to the only other impeachment trial of a president,
that of Andrew Johnson in 1868, sells for around $250.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Ross, a Washington attorney and president of the Clinton
Political Item Collectors club, is anticipating a small number of
Clinton tickets making it to the collectibles marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to be the sleepers,'' Ross predicted. ``A lot
of the Senate offices have asked people to hand them back at the
end of the day. One Senate office even requests a driver's license
in collateral.''
</P>
<P>
   Collectors in search of impeachment paraphernalia are sticklers
for nuance and oddities. For example, Ross noted that the Clinton
trial tickets are more true to the impeachment process than are the
Johnson tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson-era tickets admitted an individual to witness from
the Senate gallery the ``Impeachment of the President,'' which is
technically incorrect, since the Constitution requires the House to
vote articles of impeachment, then for the Senate to act as a court
to consider the charges. (The Senate acquitted Johnson by one vote
in 1868.)
</P>
<P>
   But the modern tickets admit a person to view ``The Impeachment
Trial of the President of the United States,'' which is the
appropriate phase for the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors are hoping that unique items associated with the
impeachment in the House and the trial in the Senate eventually
appear on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Levine, of Presidential Coin &AMP; Antique Co. in Alexandria,
Va., said that the pens used by senators to sign an oath book last
week officially opening the impeachment trial will be much sought
after.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they won't be of any value unless they are accompanied by
an authenticating letter from a senator saying they were used to
sign the book,'' Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   John Loring, a Chicago attorney and political memorabilia
enthusiast, said aficionados are on the lookout for items such as
signed note cards used by senators during the trial or copies of
the Congressional Record, the daily transcription of congressional
activity, signed by major players like House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., or Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawmakers have recognized the historic dimensions of the
impeachment activity and have begun their own collections.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James E. Rogan, R-Calif., an avid collector who also is one
of the prosecutors in the Clinton trial, has copies of the badges
House Judiciary Committee staff wore during the panel's proceedings
last month that resulted in the approval of articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., had Hyde and former House Speaker
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., sign a copy of the impeachment resolution
approved by the House that charged Clinton with obstruction of
justice and lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Virgil H. Goode Jr., D-Va., a charter member of the Clinton
Political Item Collectors club, said he plans to ask Hyde and Rep.
Ray LaHood, R-Ill., who presided over the House when Clinton was
impeached on Dec. 19, to sign a copy of the Congressional Record
for that day.
</P>
<P>
   Goode was one of five Democrats who crossed party lines to vote
for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Clinton has sparked tremendous sales of novelty
items, which may be valuable in years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our huge seller has been the Starr Report on toilet paper.
We've sold about 6,000 rolls of that,'' said Daniel Kennedy, a
sales clerk at Political Americana in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Another item racking up large sales is a bumper sticker that
says, ``Get Off His Back.'' Kennedy said that David Kendall, the
president's lawyer, has ordered a batch of 50.

IOC EXEMPTS SALT LAKE PANEL FROM SCANDAL CENSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though the International Olympic Committee is expected to ask as
many as a dozen of its members to resign next week, it will take no
action against the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, which gave cash
and gifts to IOC voters in an apparent attempt to land the 2002
Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Since SLOC's top two officials stepped down last week, ``there
is no action to be taken,'' IOC executive board member Jacques
Rogge of Belgium said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who were in the bid are no more,'' said Rogge, a
member of the special six-man panel investigating the worst scandal
in modern Olympic history. ``They took the actions they thought
were needed.''
</P>
<P>
   SLOC president Frank Joklik and senior vice president Dave
Johnson both quit under pressure, and their successors are expected
to be named within a month.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC, which has never expelled a member in its 105 years, is
likely to urge nearly a tenth of its roster of 115 to step down in
the wake of payoffs that included up to $70,000 in cash, college
tuition, jobs, free medical services, and expensive souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is also looking into charges that Sydney officials were
approached for payoffs during their bid to host the 2000 Summer
Games. ``We have a mandate to look into any possible form of
corruption,'' said Rogge. ``It is not limited to Salt Lake City.''
</P>
<P>
   Although several people with Olympic ties _ most notably former
IOC member Robert Helmick of the United States _ have demanded that
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch resign after accepting gift
shotguns from the Salt Lake organizers, IOC board members said that
would not happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Samaranch is not voting and he is not a corrupt man,
absolutely not,'' said Rogge. ``Why should someone resign at a
moment of crisis? We need leadership. We do not need resignations.
It would be ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's inquiry panel, which says it has gathered the evidence
it needs, will make a report in Lausanne, Switzerland, Jan. 24 to
the 11-member executive board, which is expected to push for
resignations. If the members do not comply, the full IOC can vote
to expel them at its meeting in Seoul in June.

THE BEST OF HIS ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is hard now to remember life before Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Young people have no frame of reference. If you are playing
basketball at the college or high school level, you cannot remember
a time when there was no Air Jordan, no Nike Swoosh, no ``Space
Jam,'' no David Falk.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe there was a time when the only bald players
were the ones losing hair. There was a time when ballhandlers did
not carry the ball on every drive to the basket. There was a time
when shorts were really short.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was not always the best basketball player who ever lived,
but only because he is not older than the sport. The pre-Michael
arguments pitted Bill Russell vs. Wilt Chamberlain, then Larry Bird
vs. Magic Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Bird shook his head and said, ``People always
want to talk about the greatest ever. Now it's Michael, and before
that, it was me or Magic. Well, I can tell you who it is. Look it
up. It's Russell and Chamberlain. Russell won 11 championships in
13 years. Chamberlain averaged 50 points a game for a whole
season.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounded logical at the time, but that was before Michael
began his run of championships, a run that certainly rivaled
Russell's, given the increase in the number of teams over the last
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Michael made that final shot against Utah last June,
it was almost impossible to find a sports fan who contested his
place atop the hardwood. Check the numbers. Count championships,
scoring titles, All-Defensive team selections, performances in the
clutch . . . Jordan is the best ever. There is no more argument.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is officially retired, we are left to assess his
place in American sports history. We know he's the best basketball
player. Where do we place him in the pantheon of national sports
legends?
</P>
<P>
   You have your list. I have mine. And Jordan's head is chiseled
on my Sports Mount Rushmore alongside those of Babe Ruth, Jackie
Robinson, and Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be clear that this is for American athletes only. We
cannot possibly measure the global significance of Pele or sundry
Olympians of the modern era.
</P>
<P>
   But in the US of A in this century, one can make a strong case
for Jordan alongside Babe, Jackie, and Ali.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth forever will be No. 1 because he played in an era when
baseball was the only real professional game and he single-handedly
kept the sport afloat after the Black Sox Scandal of 1919. The
Bambino was a kid magnet, bigger than the president when that was
considered a formidable achievement. Folklore holds that Japanese
soldiers cursed the name of Babe Ruth when attacking US forces
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Because of changing times and infinite entertainment
opportunities, no single game or figure can become larger than the
Babe was in the 1920s and '30s. It's the same logic that tells us
today's TV ratings can never top those of the days when there were
only three networks. The Babe was baseball when baseball was the
only game and everybody was a baseball fan. Case closed.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson belongs because he had the ability, the fire, and the
indomitable spirit to make America understand that athletes of
color belonged on the professional playing fields. It's hideous to
think of professional sports without black athletes, and Jackie's
The Man because he was the ideal candidate to blaze the trail.
</P>
<P>
   Ali was the perfect star when television took over sports
because he looked great, sounded great, and backed up his boasts.
He had the courage to stand his ground at the expense of his crown
when he became a conscientious objector during the Vietnam era, and
he fought long enough to convert all but a few detractors. He was
our first truly global sports star.
</P>
<P>
   And now there is Michael. He had none of Ruth's wild appetites
(unless we consider his compulsion for gambling). He was
consistently apolitical, sharing none of the controversy and social
consciousness that marked Robinson and Ali. He was the superstar of
the New World Order, famous around the world, infinitely wealthy,
loved by those who knew him and millions who didn't. He used his
fame to sell himself and wholesome products but ducked
controversial issues better than man-to-man defenses. He was
colorless and spotless, a man with no opinions and no peers when it
came to getting the job done in the final seconds of a championship
game. He could step on a movie set with no preparation and still be
a star.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth, Robinson, and Ali were unable to retire on top. They
performed in different eras when athletes were beholden to
promoters, owners, and those who used them up, then spit them out.
Jordan did everything on his own terms, retiring at the top of his
game, after a perfect game to win a final championship. Michael
made the system work for him, and he worked it better than any
other athlete in the history of sport. Like Ruth, he was a true
celebrity, an American icon on a par with Frank Sinatra and Elvis
Presley. We get only a few of those per century.

CARROLL TO COACH FOR ANOTHER YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Pete Carroll no longer is twisting in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that Carroll might be forced out as Patriots coach _
replete with rumors that Jacksonville offensive coordinator Chris
Palmer or Jets defensive coordinator Bill Belichick would be coming
aboard _ has been tempered for at least another year.
</P>
<P>
   Vice president of player personnel Bobby Grier, often blaming
himself for personnel decisions and draft choices, said in a
teleconference Wednesday that Carroll's job was never in jeopardy
but that the team had to go through its normal evaluation process,
an annual occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we went through the process, I don't think his job was in
jeopardy,'' said Grier. ``We had to go through the evaluation to
get things on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   There were still strong rumors of Palmer's possible return to
New England circulating along the Eastern Seaboard, though Grier's
comments appeared to debunk them.
</P>
<P>
   Grier divulged that, as reported, the evaluation of the coach
and the team involved interviews with players and coaches in the
wake of a 9-7 season that ended with a first-round playoff loss at
Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   He vowed to make personnel changes, which could mean a dip into
free agency for a top-flight offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   Though Grier said, ``Let's not point the finger at the offensive
line coach,'' for the Patriots' problems running the ball, Paul
Boudreau was fired from that post Tuesday. With him went receivers
coach Steve Walters.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll is currently evaluating other assistants, and other
changes could be in the works.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus was that the millions spent on linemen Bruce
Armstrong, Max Lane, and Todd Rucci didn't work out, although
statistics show that Drew Bledsoe would have passed for more than
4,000 yards had he remained healthy, an indication that the
quarterback was protected well; and that the featured back, Robert
Edwards, ran for almost 1,200 yards and averaged 3.8 per carry,
generally a sign the running game was at least decent.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not good enough for Carroll or Grier.
</P>
<P>
   Coupling that with the feeling that the linemen drafted two
years ago haven't progressed enough to take over as starters, Grier
thought the running game needed to go in a different direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we went through and talked to people, what was
disappointing to everyone was that we didn't fulfill our goal,''
siad Grier. ``We're disappointed in the performance not only of the
head coach but the performance of the players, and we're trying to
make some corrections. We're not satisfied with the run game, the
offensive line, and the running backs. We'd like to make changes as
far as personnel goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we don't want to do is point fingers at the line coach.
There are a lot of things beyond that. We haven't run the ball
effectively in three years. We had a great running back in Curtis
Martin. We have a young running back who is still developing. We
were not happy in the development of some of the young players. We
have a couple of young players in (Damon) Denson and (Ed) Ellis who
will progress and become players for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier also questioned the makeup of the team in terms of age and
the methods used to discipline players. He said Carroll's West
Coast/San Francisco style works with veteran teams, but the two
have discussed ways to alter that approach based on the fact that
the Patriots are a young team.
</P>
<P>
   He said he probably would change the mix of the team and
supplement the younger players with older ones if necessary _
exactly the recipe Parcells employed here.
</P>
<P>
   Grier said that could be accomplished through free agency,
pointing to players like Henry Thomas, Zefross Moss, Willie Clay,
Shawn Jefferson, and Mark Wheeler as veterans who came in and
filled such roles. Translated, that may mean don't hold your breath
awaiting free agents such as Antonio Freeman and J.J. Stokes.
</P>
<P>
   He envisions upgrades at offensive line, linebacker, cornerback,
and quarterback, where Scott Zolak's days may be numbered.
</P>
<P>
   Grier seemed taken aback when asked which of Carroll's qualities
persuaded the Patriots to keep him. The personnel boss said Carroll
was ``hardworking,'' did a good job keeping the team together
through massive injuries, and kept the offense current on NFL
innovations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of this organization is reaching the Super Bowl.
Everything else falls short,'' said Grier. ``There are things we've
discussed concerning game management and personnel development and
some other things that we'd like to improve in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete's a young coach and he's learning as he goes. I happened
to listen to (San Francisco coach) Steve Mariucci at his (contract
extension) press conference, and there are things he mentioned
about clock management and things he needs to improve on. Young
coaches have to do some work in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his recent drafts, Grier said, ``I'll accept all and full
responsibility. I won't pass that off on anybody. I'm being
evaluated like everybody else in organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier was questioned about his interviews of players such as
Armstrong, Bledsoe, and Ted Johnson after the season, and he said
the players' response to Carroll was mostly positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things we talked about are things I won't betray
confidences,'' he said. ``There were a lot of positive things
said.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier said he wasn't in any way trying to let the players make
the decision on Carroll but wanted their viewpoints on what changes
were necessary, just as he wanted such input from the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I interviewed everyone,'' said Grier. ``It's not unlike what I
did last year and what we'll do again. There's accountability that
all of us need to feel. I'm disappointed at some of (the players).
There's accountability that the players have to accept, too.''
</P>
<P>
   That will include attending the offseason conditioning program.
Grier said the number of participants in Parcells's offseason
program often was inflated, but he added that there have been too
many players who didn't care enough. He said he's met with Carroll
and strength coach Johnny Parker to discuss ways to get more
players with the program but he was not specific about new
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   As for the negative comments by some players at the end of the
season, Grier said, ``There's a concern. A lot of negative things
were said in the heat of battle. We have emotional young players. A
week after, when interviewing those same players, you got a
different response from them and a different perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   In summary, said Grier, ``I'm probably the most disappointed guy
in this organization other than the general public.''

HOUSE PROSECUTORS WARM UP FOR THURSDAY'S PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House prosecutors on Wednesday rehearsed the
arguments they will make Thursday when the Senate hears why they
believe President Clinton should be convicted in his impeachment
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 House prosecutors practiced their oral arguments in the
Senate chamber, which was closed to the public for the warm-up. The
actual session, which starts at 1 p.m. EST Thursday, will be open.
</P>
<P>
   All members of the House team are Republicans, white and male
and their ranks include former U.S. attorneys, county prosecutors
and a judge.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors have a total of 24 hours over three days to make
their case. Here's what to look for Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee and a former trial lawyer, will make the opening
statement. Also delivering remarks will be Rep. James
Sensenbrenner, Jr., R-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner said he is a ``compulsive nonprocrastinator'' who
spent last weekend rewriting, cutting and pasting his opening
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not done by staff, it is not done by a ghost writer,
it is done by Jim Sensenbrenner and no one else,'' he said. ``This
is the biggest speech I will ever give.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James E. Rogan of California, a former Los Angeles County
prosecutor, will argue that Clinton committed perjury before a
federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Calm and deliberate, Rogan, 41, was appointed in 1990 By
Republican Gov. George Deukmejian to the bench, making him
California's youngest judge at age 33. He once won a drunken
driving case by pouring out 10 beers in front of jurors to visually
illustrate how much a defendant had consumed.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan is a born-again Christian and former high school dropout,
who never knew his biological father and whose mother was a
convicted felon and welfare recipient. Raised by his grandparents,
he attended community college and eventually got a law degree from
the University of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Bryant, 50, a former U.S. attorney in Tennessee, brings
a measured, deliberate style to his work. His assignment is to
deliver a chronology of events, starting with Clinton's oath of
office.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a federal prosecutor, Bryant prosecuted a member of
his state's congressional delegation, Democratic Rep. Harold E.
Ford, on charges of bank fraud, mail fraud and tax fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant resigned from the Justice Department after his superiors
supported Ford's request for a new jury. Ford was eventually
acquitted, but Bryant later used his high-profile role in the Ford
case to win his seat in Congress. As a federal prosecutor, he had
one of the highest conviction rates of any U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., who will focus on the obstruction
of justice charge, said he has worked to make his presentation
concise ``because I don't want to bore the Senate with a lot of
details.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said when he goes home to the apartment he shares with
his brother, Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., a juror in the
impeachment trial, ``We don't talk about the facts of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Asa Hutchinson, who was nominated in 1982 by President Reagan to
be the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, will be
prosecuting his second Clinton. He once prosecuted and convicted
the president's brother, Roger, on drug charges while the president
was governor of the state.

   HELLO, AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On two days' notice, Bebe Neuwirth returns Thursday
night to her Tony Award-winning role as the hard-as-nails Velma
Kelly in ``Chicago'' at the Shubert Theater. Until Jan. 26 Ms.
Neuwirth will replace Ute Lemper, who has been battling the flu and
laryngitis for two weeks and has been advised by doctors to take a
rest.
</P>
<P>
   IMAGES IN DANCE
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a night at the theater, the business people wanted
to see performances that reflected their lives. And the warriors
wanted to see tales of their own adventures. So as Kabuki developed
as popular theater during Japan's Edo period (1603-1868), two
genres of dance drama evolved: the sewamono, based on domestic
matters, and the jidaimono, derived from historic events. At 8 p.m.
on Feb. 12 and 13, the Japan Society, at 333 E. 47th St.will
present three of Japan's most distinguished actors _ Nakamura
Shijaku, Nakamura Kannojo and Nakamura Kyozo _ in a typical program
consisting of each type of Kabuki dance.
</P>
<P>
   WHOSE BLUES?
</P>
<P>
   His name is Riley B. King, but the world knows him as B.B. King.
At 73, after more than 50 albums and eight Grammy Awards, he is
still brightening lives by singing and playing the blues. Although
he may be many people's favorite blues singer, he says his favorite
is Bobby (Blue) Bland. The two will perform at 8 p.m. on Saturday
at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   COMING ATTRACTIONS
</P>
<P>
   A musical that won five Tony Awards, including best book and
score, after opening on Broadway in 1978 will begin the 1999 season
at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn. ``On the 20th
Century,'' with book and lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green
and music by Cy Coleman, will run from April 9 to July 3. The
Goodspeed's other productions will be ``No, No, Nanette'' (July 9
to Oct. 2) and ``Glimmerglass'' (Oct. 8 to Dec. 19).
</P>
<P>
   SECOND SIGHT
</P>
<P>
   It's an encore for the Eifman Ballet of St. Petersburg, Russia,
which earned accolades when it introduced itself to New York in a
weeklong engagement last spring. On Tuesday, the company, led by
the choreographer Boris Eifman, is returning to City Center, for
two weeks, through Jan. 31. Its program includes not only ``Red
Giselle'' and ``Tchaikovsky,'' which created a stir last year, but
also three American premieres: ``The Karamazovs,'' set to
Rachmaninoff, Wagner and Mussorgsky; ``Requiem,'' set to Mozart,
and ``My Jerusalem,'' set to techno-rock, Rachmaninoff, Mozart and
religious music.  &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ The New York Philharmonic has not exactly been a
stranger to points beyond Manhattan in recent years. During Kurt
Masur's seven and a half years as its music director, the orchestra
has twice traveled to Latin America and to Asia, and to Europe four
times. But until now Masur and the Philharmonic had not made their
way across the United States together.
</P>
<P>
   Before it began its current seven-city tour, the orchestra had
not traveled in the United States since 1990, when Zubin Mehta was
conducting. And it had not appeared on the West Coast since 1986.
So the journey, which concludes Friday night in Boston after taking
the Philharmonic from West Coast to East, has included stops in
cities it had not visited in more than a decade, including Los
Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, its appearances have caused something of a
stir. So why did the Philharmonic wait this long? ``It's a matter
of money,'' Masur said during the orchestra's stop here. ``We need
support to make these tours. It's a partnership to decide where to
go next.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the Philharmonic's partner is Citibank. For nearly
20 years it has underwritten most of the Philharmonic's tours,
although this is the first time Citibank has paid for an American
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a terrific relationship with Citibank, but they like
to show their flag around the globe,'' said Deborah Borda, the
Philharmonic's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   For those attending these concerts, the long wait seemed worth
it. ``The music really reached my soul,'' said Sylvia Dillon, a
longtime Southern California resident, after the orchestra's
appearance on Saturday at Royce Hall here. The program consisted of
two powerful Fifth Symphonies, Beethoven's and Shostakovich's.
</P>
<P>
   The reception in the sold-out 1,838-seat hall was nothing short
of ecstatic. Stacy Peralta, who accompanied his wife and 8-year-old
son to the concert, said they had ``a terrific time,'' adding,
``These people must be lit up for years.''
</P>
<P>
   The music critic of The Los Angeles Times, Mark Swed, wrote: ``I
have never heard this orchestra sound better. I have seldom heard
any orchestra sound better.''
</P>
<P>
   The previous night, similar enthusiasm greeted the Philharmonic
at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, where
the program included two tone poems by Richard Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't improve on this,'' said Paul Darbee, who attended
that concert. ``It sets the standard.'' Darbee and his wife, Ricki,
who have lived in Orange County since 1969, come from Ohio, where
they heard the famously autocratic conductor George Szell lead the
Cleveland Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Masur would be fiercer,'' said Ms. Darbee. ``In
fact, he's pretty sprightly. I like the way he connects with his
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Because this is an American tour, the Philharmonic is connecting
with audiences in an unusual way. Most of the orchestra's 107
members were born in the United States, so for many the trip has
personal resonance.
</P>
<P>
   The Royce Hall performance summoned fond memories for the
violinist Glenn Dicterow, a Los Angeles native who has spent nearly
19 years as the Philharmonic's concertmaster. ``It's practically
home turf for me,'' said Dicterow, who made his professional debut
at Royce when he was 14 and served as concertmaster of the Los
Angeles Philharmonic before moving to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Though Masur's own roots are in Germany, he acknowledged that
there was something special about this tour. ``Maybe they are a
little bit proud of their orchestra,'' he said of the audiences,
trying to explain the extra effort his players have brought to the
concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Touring with them here, you find out that they have families
all over the country,'' he said. ``Very often I meet the family.
For me, that's a wonderful feeling, another connection to the
musicians and their backgrounds.'' And in such connections, ``there
is a trust that makes the music making more joyful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There were some complaints along the way, mostly from critics
lamenting the absence of American music. ``For an American
orchestra to tour its own country without offering at least one
American piece,'' wrote Alan Ulrich of The San Francisco Examiner,
``is little short of disgraceful.'' In San Francisco Masur and the
Philharmonic played Tchaikovsky in addition to Beethoven,
Shostakovich and Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, in The Orange County Register, Timothy Mangan
wrote, ``It would have been good, in this orchestra's first visit
to these parts since 1986, to hear some of the American music it
has been unearthing in the past few seasons at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Masur disagreed. ``Why play American music in America?'' he
asked. ``We always take some American music when we play outside
the country. Why does there need to be nationalism inside the
country?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think American orchestras should always play American
music. And after all, you cannot very often hear Shostakovich the
way the New York Philharmonic plays it.''

   U.S. Opens Hotline For Year 2000 Queries &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With fewer than 365 shopping days left until the possible onset
of a millenium bug, the federal government has sprung into action
and created ... a telephone hotline.
</P>
<P>
   Started last week, the new Year 2000 help line (1-888-USA-4-Y2K)
has recorded answers to common questions and also 25 operators
standing by from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time, Monday through
Friday. The idea is to help allay concerns, answer questions and
promote preparedness for citizens concerned about the possible
impact of widespread computer glitches in the banking, government,
utilities, telecommunications and airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem is an artifact of computer programmers'
decisions in years past to enter years only as two-digits; when the
clock rolls over from 99 to 00, some computers are expected to shut
down.
</P>
<P>
   In a press conference announcing the phone service last week,
President Clinton's Year 2000 czar, John Koskinen, said all signs
were looking up, noting ``at this point in time we do not think
there is any basis for concern about the basic infrastructure in
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget infrastructure. What about my toaster oven? ``One of the
things we'll get a lot of is questions about specific pieces of
equipment and household appliances,'' said Jack Gribben,
spokesperson for President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion.
``We'll provide people with whatever information we can, but they
really need to contact the manufacturer.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A &UR;  &LR; Really Big Scanner Still Comes Up Short &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Stanford University research team plans to use cutting-edge
technology to scan 3D images of the some of the greatest works of
art in Florence, Rome and the Vatican. But it seems the team could
benefit from the use of some old-fashioned technology, namely a
tape measure.
</P>
<P>
   The project's goal is to create three-dimensional images of all
of Michelangelo's statues for academic use although, according to
David F. Salisbury, a Stanford spokesman, there could also be
commercial applications for the scanning technology.
</P>
<P>
   The team had a scanner specially constructed that uses a video
camera and laser beams to capture and digitize the images. The
scanner, including the gantry on which it sits, is 20 feet high, a
size designed specifically to permit it to scan ``David,'' the
largest of Michelangelo's sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Stanford researchers arrived in Florence they
discovered that the scanner came up short. While art history books
commonly list ``David'' as standing 20 feet tall (14 feet of statue
and 6 feet of pedestal), the statue actually is 23 feet tall (17
feet of statue and 6 feet of pedestal). The researchers were forced
to make some modifications to their scanner, according to
Salisbury. ``It's a nontrivial problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the only challenge. The researchers also will have to
contend with the difficulties of accurately depicting the surface
colors of the sculptures, and of handling the huge file sizes of
these scans of works in museums in Florence, Rome and the Vatican.
Once they have scanned a sculpture, the researchers will apply
advanced algorithms to convert the digital data into a 3-D model,
the university said. &QL;

<P>
   DVD Player for Notebooks But What a Battery Hog &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new ultra-thin notebook from Compaq Computer includes a DVD
player, which could be a neat addition for mobile movie buffs, just
so long as they don't plan to watch Titanic. The reason is that the
DVD player eats a great deal of battery life, cutting roughly an
hour from the average useful battery life of 2{ to 3 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The new Compaq Presario 1920 is scheduled to go on sale later
this month. Roughly an inch thick and weighing just five pounds,
the notebook computer has 64 megabytes of RAM, a 6.4-gigabyte hard
drive and a Pentium II processor, the exact speed of which has not
been announced. The company also has not yet set a price.
</P>
<P>
   The computer is yet another tribute to the capacity of the
electronics industry to cleverly shrink gadgets and functions into
mobile form. Greg Memo, Compaq vice president for the Presario
Mobile Division, said it was a particular challenge to fit the DVD
into an ultrathin notebook because the device consumes a great deal
of resources when running. ``It's a very intense application,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Certain technological advances could help, such as improving
battery life. Alternatively, someone might consider cutting two
hours out of Titanic. &QL;

   Want Your Own Talk Show? You Can, On the Net &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It only seems as though everyone and her grandmother has a radio
talk show. Soon, however, everybody might. The catch is, the shows
won't take place on the radio, but on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   A Silicon Valley company, TalkNetRadio.com, plans to provide
Internet users with the technology to start their own talk shows,
on any topic under the sun (minus hard-core pornography and hate).
In other words, users who want a half an hour of ``airtime'' to
pontificate on baking, chat about the state of dental hygiene, or
invite listeners to share their thoughts on the wild world of the
Azalia soon will have a format.
</P>
<P>
   The way the technology works is that the talk show hosts will
speak into a microphone from their home computer. The computer will
digitize the sound, send it over the Internet to TalkNetRadio.com
in Santa Clara, Calif., which in turn will make it available for
listeners to download in real-time. The listeners in turn can
e-mail their responses back to the talk show host.
</P>
<P>
   TalkNetRadio.com has begun registering aspiring online talk show
hosts on its Web site. In the third quarter this year, it will
start offering the service, which involves sending the hosts a
marketing kit, and Web page and banner ad templates to promote
their talk show, said the company's chief, Ted Ganchiff.
</P>
<P>
   The service is free, with a big caveat. Ganchiff said the
audiences could be no larger than 30 people, to keep the company's
bandwith costs low, making these radio shows more like
tele-conferences via the Net. Also, people who want to use their
shows to promote products, or for business purposes, will have to
pay an, as of yet undetermined, fee. This is where the company
plans to make its money.
</P>
<P>
   The concept behind TalkNetRadio comes as commercial radio
streamed via the Net is increasingly popular. A recent study by
Arbitron found that 6 percent of Americans have listened to the
radio on line and that figure is growing. &QL;

   Follow the Soaps On Line By Checking With a PDA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One downside of always being on the go is that it's tough to
follow the latest murder plots, marital affairs, or the sudden
appearance of an evil twin. No, not the normal doings in your
office, we're talking about fans of television soap operas who
really want to keep track of each episode's events. Now, they can
do so through their handheld computers.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia TriStar Interactive is starting a new Soap City Daily
Dose newsletter that downloads automatically to a Palm Pilot or
Windows CE device. Columbia joins roughly 70 companies, including
the likes of The New York Times, USA Today and Excite that provide
content to AvantGo Inc. in San Mateo, Calif. AvantGo then makes the
information accessible via a Palm Pilot or Windows CE device.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers plug their mobile device into the Internet and
receive automatic updates of their choice, said David Rice,
director of content development for AvantGo.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Soap Opera site, who finds it really necessary to
have instant and mobile access to developments on major soap
operas? ``A lot of college students are hooked on soaps and a lot
of college students have'' handheld computers or personal digital
assistants, said Lynda Keeler, general manager of Columbia TriStar
Interactive. ``They can be in class and get their favorite
updates.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's Instant Replay At a Mouse Click &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to technology fresh out of Silicon Valley, it has just
become even easier to go stark raving mad at officials who blow
crucial calls during football games.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that is one possible use for Replay TV technology,
which offers television viewers a way to replay, pause and record
television programs in real time. The device, created by Palo
Alto-based Replay Networks Inc., is a box that goes on top or next
to the TV set. Inside, it's essentially a digital videocassette
recorder with the brains of a computer that translates analogue
television signals into digital data and then records them on a
self-contained hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to permitting real-time replay, the set-top box can
be programmed to automatically search and record programs on
specific topics, or certain actors. As a result, viewers can create
directories such as the ``ER file,'' that will record and store all
ER showings, said Anthony Wood, chief excutive of Replay. Woods
said the recorder would also continue to record an ongoing show
even while the user replayed part of the program that just
transpired.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, which should be commercially available in March
for around $700, won ``best of show'' honors last weekend at the
Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Overseas Internet Users Protest High Access Cost &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Internet users in Brazil said on Wednesday that they would stage
a cybers strike: They pledged to refuse to log on to the Internet
for the day to protest the high-cost of Net access.
</P>
<P>
   The cyber strikers in Brazil join brethren who have engaged in
so-called ``Internet strikes'' in Germany, France, Spain, the Czech
Republic, China and Poland. Often organized by students and
academics, the strikes are meant to protest high access charges
that can lead to hundreds of dollars in monthly Internet bills.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, supporters claimed as many as 500,000 of 2.2 million
Internet would participate in the boycott, the Associated Press
reported. The boycott was organized through an e-mail chain letter,
according to Antonio Tavares, head of an Internet provider
association.
</P>
<P>
   In most countries the protests are aimed not at the service
providers, but at the national telecommunication companies, which
are sometimes state-owned monopolies that dictate the telephone
access charges.
</P>
<P>
   In China, protesters there said they would boycott the Internet
every Sunday this month. There the monthly cost of basic access
runs $30 to $43, which is more than a quarter of the average
monthly income, according to The Guangzhou Daily newspaper.

IRWIN WINKLER: FILM PRODUCER ON THE SIDE OF UGLY DUCKLINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ It was 1966, and Irwin Winkler, an aspiring film
producer, had come to Hollywood from New York with a project for
Julie Christie. Winkler went to the offices of MGM and saw its
president, Robert O'Brien, who agreed to make the movie with one
proviso: he wanted to replace Julie Christie with Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler replied, with some understatement, ``Well, that would be
a big rewrite.''
</P>
<P>
   Winkler, whose newest film, ``At First Sight,'' which he also
directed, opens Friday, said the other day: ``So we rewrote it for
Elvis Presley. It made me wary of Hollywood ways, and with that as
a start I said, OK, anything is going to happen now.''
</P>
<P>
   And it did.
</P>
<P>
   From his first film, ``Double Trouble'' (yes, with Elvis),
Winkler and his business partner, Robert Chartoff, moved on to
produce some of the best and most provocative films of the 1970s
and '80s, including John Boorman's ``Point Blank'' (1967), Sydney
Pollack's ``They Shoot Horses, Don't They'' (1969), John Avildsen's
``Rocky'' (1976) and the four other ``Rocky'' movies, Martin
Scorsese's ``New York, New York'' (1977) and ``Raging Bull'' (1980)
as well as ``The Right Stuff'' (1983), directed by Philip Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   On his own, Winkler produced such films as Costa Gavras'
``Betrayed'' (1988) and ``Music Box'' (1989) as well as Scorsese's
``Goodfellas'' (1990).
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Brooklyn-born Winkler, now 65, has also turned
to directing, making such films as ``Guilty by Suspicion'' (1991),
``Night and the City'' (1992) and ``The Net'' (1995). In his newest
film, loosely based on a nonfictional account by the physician
Oliver Sacks, Val Kilmer plays a blind man who briefly recovers,
then loses his sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``What appealed to me was that the real character, a blind
masseur named Shirl Jennings of Atlanta, had this operation to
regain his sight and then had a horrible problem in understanding
what sight brings you,'' Winkler said. ``To me it seemed like a
very courageous story.''
</P>
<P>
   Winkler has produced more than 40 movies over the last four
decades, making him one of the most prolific and successful
producers in Hollywood. The five ``Rocky'' films, which have
grossed more than $1 billion combined around the world, have made
him quite wealthy: he and Chartoff share the copyright with United
Artists.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Winkler has mixed feelings about present-day Hollywood. What
altered Hollywood irrevocably, he said, was the notorious 1980 film
``Heaven's Gate,'' Michael Cimino's drama about immigrant settlers
in 19th-century Wyoming. The film's excesses and cost overruns
nearly ruined its producers, United Artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the studios suddenly realized that one film can bring them
down,'' Winkler said. ``They said they would not let one filmmaker
or actor control their destiny. They basically took the
individuality away from the filmmakers, the directors, the
producers. They changed the product. They exercised a lot more
control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well that was good in the days of Darryl Zanuck and Harry Cohn
and the other moguls,'' he added. ``Those guys loved movies and
they had no other businesses so they had to make money on their
movies. But now it was in the hands of corporate managers: people
who didn't have any great love for movies but a great love for the
bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   A result, said Winkler, was movie-making by committee, with
various executives giving filmmakers notes, sometimes conflicting,
about how to proceed with their films.
</P>
<P>
   He doubts that studios today would make such downbeat films as
``They Shoot Horses, Don't They,'' ``Raging Bull,'' ``Goodfellas''
and even the Cinderella fable ``Rocky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even back then, `Rocky' was the most difficult film to make,''
said Winkler in the study of his elegant Beverly Hills home. ``You
sat in the office of United Artists and told them you've got a
story about a broken-down fighter in Philadelphia who meets this
ugly duckling, and they'd say: `Philadelphia? No one wants to go to
Philadelphia. And what do you mean, ugly duckling, you've got two
ugly people?' They said: `Who wants to see a movie about two ugly
people who kiss on screen? And you want to star a guy named
Sylvester Stallone? You're crazy.''' ( Winkler and Chartoff had to
mortgage their homes to complete the film).
</P>
<P>
   Winkler grew up in Coney Island, attended New York University
and after a brief, unhappy stint as an agent at the William Morris
agency arrived in Hollywood in 1966 and started producing movies.
Winkler and his wife, Margo, have three sons, two of them film
directors. His successful partnership with Chartoff lasted until
1983.
</P>
<P>
   Chartoff has since produced several films and has become
involved in charity work, but Winkler remains restless. His other
forthcoming producing projects include an adaptation of the book
``Lush Life,'' about Billy Strayhorn, Duke Ellington's co-writer
and arranger; ``Spite House,'' about Robert Garwood, the Vietnam
soldier convicted of collaborating with the enemy, and ``Winds of
Change,'' about the life of a doctor from the 1950s to the present.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the films Winkler produced there were, of course,
financial disappointments, the worst being ``The Right Stuff,''
based on Tom Wolfe's book about the nation's first astronauts. Even
16 years later, he said, its box office failure rankles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the best films I was ever involved with,'' Winkler
said. ``It got Academy Award nominations, the cover of Newsweek,
eight pages in Time, great reviews. And nobody went to see it. I'll
never know why. It was a wonderful film, and there was no audience
for it. And it still hurts.''

SENATE FACES A FLOOD OF CYBER MESSAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate's computer system has been nearly
paralyzed by a seven-fold increase in the amount of electronic mail
pouring into lawmakers' offices ahead of Thursday's impeachment
trial.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical day, about 70,000 e-mail messages are sent to
various Senate offices. But since late December, the Senate has
received an average of 500,000 e-mails daily. This deluge is
expected to continue, slowing Senate computer systems as long as
the trial of President Clinton lasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen it this bad,'' Joseph Keenan, an employee in
the Senate press gallery, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members in the office of Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., faced a
queue of 7,000 e-mails after one recent weekend _ mostly on the
subject of impeachment. Levin's office normally receives less than
200 e-mails over a weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The onslaught of messages has kept many people outside the
Capitol from reaching Senate offices through the Internet and has
delayed e-mails sent to and from Senate offices. Some Senate
employees complained that e-mails they've sent never arrived at
their destination.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Lackey, press secretary to Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, R-Maine,
said he received an e-mail on Jan. 8 from a Maine congressman's
office. The message was dated Dec. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Senate employees experience little delay communicating with one
another on the Senate's internal e-mail system, but even an e-mail
sent to the House side of the Capitol is routed through the same
computer server that connects the Senate with the public and other
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, received 10,000 impeachment
related e-mails over New Year's weekend and is continuing to
receive thousands of e-mails and phone calls each day. Before
impeachment became an issue in the Senate, Hutchison received an
average of 700 e-mails a day.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, hasn't had the any trouble because his
office doesn't have an e-mail address. Kathy Dempsey, Gramm's
deputy press secretary, said Gramm has held off because other
offices have been frustrated with e-mail delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Iraq and other big items, the system was overrun,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Various issues have caused Senate computer systems to bog down
for a day or two, but the system has never been slowed for weeks as
it has with the impeachment issue.
</P>
<P>
   The number of e-mails is so great that many Senate offices are
having trouble logging them into pro- or anti-Clinton categories.
John Brennan, Levin's press secretary, said the e-mails ``are all
over the place'' with opinions on whether Clinton should be removed
from office and whether the Senate should conduct a full trial.
</P>
<P>
   Senate staff members have been advised to use the telephone or
fax machine if they want to communicate with people in government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Senate technicians increased computer capacity by 50 percent
last year and are currently trying to add more capacity, but they
said the computer delays are expected to continue until the amount
of e-mail slows.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of e-mails has dramatically increased, a few
Senate press secretaries said they hadn't seen an increase in the
overall number of phone calls and letters received by their
offices, but they said the subject matter has mostly been on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, as the House was debating whether to impeach Clinton
on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, that chamber also

   House Administration Chairman Bill Thomas, R-Calif., is

   In a recent letter to colleagues, Thomas said more than 11

normally receives 10 million to 11 million visits per month.

STUDY CASTS NEW LIGHT ON WHO PAYS FOR HEALTH INSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a study that could diminish the power of businesses to sway
national health care policy, researchers have found that private
employers pick up far less of the nation's health insurance tab
than previously assumed.
</P>
<P>
   Less than half of Americans _ about 43 percent _ have health
insurance that is paid for, in part or in full, by private sector
companies, according to a study in the current New England Journal
of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional notion has been that employers subsidize health
insurance for 60 percent of Americans. But the figure is far lower
when researchers, using data from a 1997 US Census Bureau current
population survey, subtract government workers, retirees, and
workers who pay 100 percent of their insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   The implication, according to study authors, is that business's
influence over such issues as managed care reform or mental health
coverage far outweighs its actual contribution to health care
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have operated under the assertion that employers pay
for everything, and therefore they should get their say,'' said
study coauthor Dr. Steffanie J. Woolhandler, associate professor at
Harvard Medical School. ``This study makes it clear that businesses
are paying for only a minority of the bill, and that they shouldn't
be calling the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The study's authors include Woolhandler; Drs. David Himmelstein
and David H. Bor, associate professors of Harvard Medical School;
and Dr. Olveen Carrasquillo, assistant professor at Columbia
University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. All four authors
are members of Physicians for a National Health Program, an
organization that advocates universal health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups bristled at the authors' conclusion that private
sector payors should have less influence over health policy,
particularly in Massachusetts, where 50.3 percent of residents have
insurance subsidized by private employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health care is the most expensive overhead item facing
employers today,'' said John Gould, president of the Associated
Industries of Massachusetts, an organization that represents 5,000
businesses in the state and has argued against excessive regulation
of the state's managed care industry. ``If I were paying the bill
for 43 percent of Americans, I would feel my right to comment would
have validity.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was better received within academic circles. John
McDonough, a Brandeis University health policy researcher and
former state representative, said the study brought up legitimate
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good hit,'' McDonough said. ``It will be surprising to a lot
of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the study's findings: 9 million Americans have access to
employer-sponsored health insurance but must pay 100 percent of
their premiums. Also, individual, out-of-pocket spending accounted
for 26 percent of total health care spending, outstripping spending
by private sector employers, who contribute just 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the nation's health care tab is picked up by
taxpayers, through government programs such as Medicare and
Medicaid, as well as insurance coverage for military personnel,
veterans, and government employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think people need to think differently about who pays for
health care,'' said Woolhandler.

breast cancer by 90 percent, and the risk of dying from the disease
by 80 percent to 90 percent. The new study, by researchers at the
Mayo Clinic, is regarded as the most reliable work to date on the

BIPARTISANSHIP IS ELUSIVE COMMODITY IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 17)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Bipartisan'' is the word senators are using as
they stride before television cameras to describe the way they and
their colleagues are conducting the impeachment trial of Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Each senator, having been sworn to impartiality by Chief Justice
William Rehnquist, promises to weigh the evidence as it is
presented and then, without consideration for party politics, to
vote for or against the two articles of impeachment passed by the
House.
</P>
<P>
   But the routine often is nothing more than a charade to please
the folks back home who want their elected representatives to work
together for the good of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Most senators know how they will vote on impeachment. But they
desperately want to avoid the appearance of narrow partisanship
that tarnished the House proceedings in which debate exploded with
ideological rhetoric and in which Republicans on the Judiciary
Committee voted against Clinton while Democrats voted for him.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators undoubtedly hope that when they get down to a
final judgment on Clinton's fate, polarization really will give way
to bipartisanship. That is what happened a quarter century ago when
the House Judiciary Committee approved articles of impeachment
against Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans joined Democrats in voting to impeach the
president. But that is where the process ended because Nixon,
having been informed by congressional leaders that he would be
found guilty in the Senate, resigned rather than suffer the ordeal
of a trial.
</P>
<P>
   It was the quest for an aura of bipartisanship that led the
Senate on Jan. 8 to vote 100 to 0 for the compromise on trial
procedures proposed by conservative Republican Phil Gramm of Texas
and liberal Democrat Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts. That
remarkable tally permitted the Senate to draw a sharp contrast
between itself and the House.
</P>
<P>
   But bipartisanship is an elusive commodity in an institution
such as the Senate, which is made up of members elected on party
platforms.
</P>
<P>
   That is why many observers contend that Clinton's Republican
prosecutors cannot garner the 67 votes _ two thirds of the Senate _
required by the Constitution to convict the president. That is why
a number of senators in both parties have suggested that in the
final analysis Congress should censure the president rather than
let him off without an official congressional reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, that may be the most important feat of
bipartisanship in the tragedy of the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Although bipartisanship often is difficult to attain on Capitol
Hill, it can be crucial in determining the course of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   When George Bush prepared to dispatch American combat forces to
turn back Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1991, he sought a
congressional resolution of support from a Democratic-controlled
Congress. Many senators, especially Democrats, were wary of America
becoming mired in another Vietnam. Some compared Bush's plan to the
1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which passed Congress and granted
Lyndon Johnson authority to project America into the deadly morass
in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Bush got his bipartisan resolution. By a vote of
52 to 42, the Senate approved the declaration. It fared even better
in the House, where the vote was 250 to 83. Bush already had
authority as commander-in-chief to send troops into combat, but he
felt more secure doing so once Congress had pledged its support.
</P>
<P>
   When the building blocks of America's enlightened post-World War
II foreign policy were put in place during Harry Truman's
presidency, their acceptance and approval in Congress depended on
the bipartisan leadership exerted by Michigan Republican Arthur
Vandenberg, who headed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in
the Republican-dominated 80th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Vandenberg, who had been a leading isolationist before the war,
became an invaluable partner in the initiatives taken by Truman to
help establish the United Nations, win congressional support for
the Marshall Plan and aid to Greece and Turkey, and break the
Soviet Union's blockade on occupied Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Everett Dirksen of Illinois played a somewhat
similar role in helping Lyndon Johnson push the 1964 Civil Rights
Act through the Senate. Johnson desperately needed GOP votes to
break the southern-imposed filibuster that prevented passage of the
measure that opened public accommodations to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   In the decades immediately preceding that struggle, Republican
conservatives had joined their southern colleagues consistently to
bottle up civil rights legislation. So Johnson knew that the only
way he could break the filibuster, masterminded by Georgia's astute
Sen. Richard Russell, was to win the support of Dirksen, the Senate
Republican leader.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of such Senate Democratic leaders as Hubert
Humphrey of Minnesota and Mike Mansfield of Montana, Johnson
finally persuaded Dirksen to join the civil rights battle. Once
that happened, the pending civil rights bill, which had originated
in the House, passed the Senate and became law.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s, when Johnson was Senate majority leader and
his mentor, Sam Rayburn of Texas, was speaker of the House, they
provided immeasurable support to Republican President Dwight D.
Eisenhower on important legislative issues, especially those
involving America's commitments abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In the impeachment trial of Clinton, we can only hope that the
Senate will return to the bipartisanship it exhibited on Jan. 8
rather than emulate the narrow partisanship demonstrated by the
House.

   WASHINGTON _ In their heyday, they were the kings of Capitol
Hill, but former House speakers are finding that retirement isn't
what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   First they lost their taxpayer-financed offices. Now the
institution they once headed is trying to reclaim desks, chairs,
rugs and a host of other keepsakes _ including some priceless
artifacts _ that the former lawmakers took with them when they left
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Legendary Speaker Sam Rayburn, who dominated the House for
nearly two decades until his retirement in 1961, returned to Texas
with a treasure trove that included a 2,500-year-old Grecian urn
valued at nearly $3 million, a crystal chandelier, the original
marble speaker's rostrum and a fireplace mantel that came to the
Capitol from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the disputed items are more mundane. Former Speaker Jim
Wright of Fort Worth recreated his Capitol office at Texas
Christian University with a credenza, a small table, a couch and a
display case that had been government property.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to take it back, they can,'' Wright said. ``I
don't lay personal claim to any of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Speaker Tom Foley of Washington state, who now serves as
ambassador to Japan, has also agreed to turn over any disputed
items.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the House clerk's office have opened negotiations
with the custodians of relics claimed by Speakers Thomas P. ``Tip''
O'Neill of Massachusetts, Carl Albert of Oklahoma and John
McCormack of Massachusetts, all of whom have died.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who resigned in
November, said the Georgia Republican has no plans to recreate his
Washington office with furnishings from the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things that he's allowed to take, maybe a gift
that someone gave him,'' spokesman Mike Shields said. ``But as far
as keeping the furniture, definitely not. I don't know what he
would do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rayburn's collection is on display at the Sam Rayburn Library
and Museum in Bonham, which is fighting to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it had come up when Mr. Rayburn was alive,'' said H.G.
Delaney, the museum director. ``He had the ability to use language
that would take wallpaper off. He wouldn't be exactly pleased, I
don't think.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for missing Capitol furnishings began shortly after
Republicans took control of the House in 1995, ending 40 years of
Democratic dominance. Trying to fulfill their promise of better
management, GOP leaders ordered an inventory that revealed some
glaring gaps in the property lists.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute also highlights the changing culture of Congress. In
Rayburn's day, speakers ran the House with unquestioned authority.
Tradition and practice also gave them the right to take their
office furnishings and other mementos when they left office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these items should never have been taken from the
Capitol,'' said one official involved in the reclamation effort.
``It was a different era. We want to make this as painless as
possible for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress eliminated another retirement benefit in 1993 by ending
the practice of giving former speakers lifetime government offices
and staff. The bill gave the living speakers five years, until
Sept. 30, 1998, to make other arrangements. Wright moved to TCU,
which is also the repository for the correspondence and other
documents from his 34-year congressional career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is as near to being a replica as TCU was able to create,
given the shape of the room,'' the Fort Worth Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, who came to Congress in 1955 when Rayburn was still in
power, said speakers were expected to make their papers and
memorabilia available to the public after leaving office. O'Neill
recreated his office at Boston College, which has sent the chair
that O'Neill used on the speaker's podium back to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was done was done with the full consent and knowledge of
everyone involved,'' Wright said. ``If the rules have changed,
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The guardians of Rayburn's legacy are a bit more reluctant to
surrender the showcase items in their museum. Delaney said the
Grecian urn was a gift to Rayburn from the Greek government.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Mr. Rayburn wanted here was a replica of the speaker's
office,'' Delaney said. ``Those people are saying that he should
have had permission from the Congress. Back in those days, he would
not have had any trouble getting permission.''

</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   THIN-RED-LINE-FILM (Undated) _ The Thin Red Line'' is a very odd
movie. I think it one of the pinnacles of American filmmaking in
the 1990s, but I can also appreciate the objections leveled against
it by other film critics who were baffled, irritated or chagrined
by this three-hour challenge. By Phillip Lopate. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   1,000-MOONS-INTERNET (Undated) _ ``1,000 Moons,'' is a
five-minute digital short designed for the Internet and one of four
movies now being screened at a site called The Bit Screen
(www.TheBitScreen.com). It's hazardous to make statements about who
is or isn't doing what on the Web, but it would appear that the
site is, if not unique, then most unusual. The movies aren't
intended for showing on the theater screen or on video. Films like
``1,000 Moons'' are conceived and created to arrive by modem and be
shown solely on a computer screen. By Peter M. Nichols. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   EIFMAN-BALLET (Undated) _ At supper in his studio in St.
Petersburg or at lunch in a New York restaurant, Boris Eifman, 52,
is all good-humored gallantry. It isn't until the Russian
choreographer reveals his life story that one understands how a
surface calm harbors the emotional intensity that blazes through
his ballets. Not every choreographer has been housed in an
underground pit during a harsh early childhood in Siberia or had
all his father's relatives killed by the Germans during World War
II. Nor have most choreographers, at least in the West, had to
invent themselves within the closed society of the Soviet era. And
rare is the choreographer who, like Eifman, has never been a
professional dancer. Yet a passion for creating dances has consumed
Eifman since he was 13 and passionate dancing is synonymous with
the Eifman Ballet of St. Petersburg, which opens a two-week season
Tuesday night at City Center. By Anna Kisselgoff. (Moved). Photo.

   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE-LANE-THEATER (Undated) _ Producers are not going to tell
you what they really think of George P. Lane: that they dislike
him, that they believe he is too demanding, that they dread his
phone calls. That is because Lane represents just about every hot
young playwright and director in the theater business these days,
not to mention a crop of blue-chip actors. So producers need him.
They basically can't live without him. By Robin Pogrebin. (Moved).

`Phedre' and `Britannicus.' (Moved). Photo.

   CLASSICAL-MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   RICHTER-MUSIC (Undated) _ In 1957 the Russian pianist Sviatoslav
Richter made friends with the Canadian pianist Glenn Gould at a
concert in Moscow. And now Bruno Monsaingeon, a Canadian film
director who collaborated on projects with Gould, has issued a
documentary, ``Richter: The Enigma,'' which will open the Lincoln
Center series ``Great Pianists of the 20th Century'' on Friday
evening at the Walter Reade Theater in Manhattan. By John Russell.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ARRON-CARNEGIE-HALL (New York) _ Give a determined evolution a
little time, and it can look like a revolution. ``She completely
transformed the institution,'' the once revolutionary composer and
conductor Pierre Boulez said last week of Judith Arron, who was no
one's idea of a revolutionary, and her achievement at Carnegie
Hall. She became executive director in 1988 and played a central
role in planning for the hall's extensive centenary celebration in
1991. Now a dream of her own has come to fruition with the recent
announcement of plans for a small but versatile third performance
stage in the historic Carnegie building, replacing a movie theater
under the main auditorium. But Ms. Arron died last month, at 56,
after a long battle with cancer, and the announcement brought added
news: although the new hall will be named for Arthur and Judy
Zankel, its prime donors, the performance space itself will be
called the Judith Arron Auditorium. By James R. Oestreich. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   DUKE-ELLINGTON-MUSIC (Undated) _ Most musicians making their
Carnegie Hall debut don't open with ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''
But this was no ordinary debut. On Jan. 23, 1943, Duke Ellington
and his orchestra played to a capacity crowd in a benefit concert
for the Russian War Relief fund. Ellington was riding high. At 43
he was one of the leading exponents of swing, the exuberant style
of jazz then reaching the crest of its popularity. His music was
known throughout the world. Thousands bought his recordings,
listened to his radio broadcasts, danced to his rhythms and
romanced to his songs. That evening at Carnegie Hall, though,
Ellington chose to play more than ``Mood Indigo,'' ``Don't Get
Around Much Anymore'' and the hits his fans expected. He also made
it clear that he expected serious recognition as a composer. By
Mark Tucker. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DUKE-ELLINGTON (Undated) _ What a world to step into, if you
were inquisitive. And at the beginning of the 1920s, Duke
Ellington, touched by genius and ambition, prepared by education
and class privilege, walked into the 20th century. When he arrived
in New York in 1923, it was the present and future cultural capital
of the world. He began playing in what were known as black and
tans, joints that catered to black and white audiences, and in
1927, just a year after his first wobbly recordings under his own
name, he fell into the job that changed American cultural history.
By Peter Watrous. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ELLINGTON-RECORDINGS (Undated) _ In April, RCA will issue ``The
Duke Ellington Centennial Edition: The Complete RCA Victor
Recordings 1924-1973,'' a 24-CD set, and for the rest of the year
the label will slowly issue the music from that set in triple-CD
bunches. By June, Columbia will have reintroduced spruced-up
versions of six albums, including the film-score album ``Anatomy of
a Murder'' and the Shakespeare-inspired ``Such Sweet Thunder,'' as
well as a three-CD overview. By Ben Ratliff. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   MARISSIAUX-PHOTOGS (Undated) _ One of the rare discovery in
photography festivals this year was a Belgin pictorialist named
Gustave Marissiaux, who was widely show in Belgian, Paris, Berlin
and Itlay in the first decade or so of this century, then large
forgotten even in his own country until a 1997 retrospective at the
Musee de la Photographie in Charleroi. A show during the Mois at
the Wallonie-Bruxelles Center in Paris closed on Nov. 26, but a
beautifully illustrated and well-researched catalogue, ``Gustave
Marissiaux: La Possibilite de l'Art,'' by Marc-Emmanuel Melon, has
been published by the Charleroi museum. By Vicki Goldberg. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   SAYS-YOU-RADIO (Undated) _ ``Says You!'' _ a low-budget,
independently produced half-hour quiz show reminiscent of the
old-time radio series ``Information Please'' and the long-running
BBC series ``My Word'' _ seems to have a good chance to join the
quirky listener-supported National Public Radio pantheon that
includes ``Car Talk,'' ``This American Life'' and ``A Prairie Home
Companion.'' Recorded over Sunday brunch in various Boston-area
hotel banquet rooms, ``Says You!'' is now broadcast on more than 60
public radio stations nationwide. By Andy Meisler. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TV-THIS-LIFE (London) _ ``This Life,'' a television drama made
an inauspicious debut three years ago in Britain but went on to
become one of the most talked-about, and passionately watched,
shows in years. The series, which ended abruptly after two seasons
when the producers (but not the audience) decided that it had run
its course, has until recently been absent from American
television, its heavy use of nudity, racy language and sex having
all but assured that no network would go near it. But BBC America,
a station devoted to BBC programming that appears on TCI digital
cable and on two separate satellite systems, has brought ``This
Life'' across the ocean, leaving in the sex and some of the nudity
but excising the rudest four-letter words. The first 11 episodes,
from the first season, went on the air beginning in November; the
11th will be broadcast on Saturday at the beginning of a night
devoted entirely to ``This Life.'' By Sarah Lyall. (Moved).

<P>
   RORSTRAND-PORCELAIN-ANTIQUES (New York) _ The New York
entrepreneur, Robert Schreiber, collection of 150 Art Nouveau
Rorstrand vases, bowls and jardinieres is described by experts as
the largest and most important anywhere. A selection of 86 pieces
is now on view in ``Rorstrand: Swedish Art Nouveau Porcelain From

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House no-surprises strategy for defending
the president aims to risk nothing that would sway the majority of
Americans against Bill Clinton or change the judgment of senators
who now appear unlikely to convict him and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the constitutional and factual arguments prepared for
the Senate trial and detailed in the 130-page trial brief released
Wednesday look very similar to the ones the president's lawyers
made in the impeachment case in the House. They are that:
</P>
<P>
   --While the president, in an effort to conceal his affair and
avoid embarrassment, misled his family, staff, and the nation about
his relationship with White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky, he did
not intend to commit perjury or obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   --There is no evidence to support the allegations the president
lied under oath, and innocent explanations _ faulty memory among
them _ explain why the president's federal grand jury testimony
sometimes appears at odds with Lewinsky's.
</P>
<P>
   --No matter how badly the president behaved, his wrongdoing
falls short of the constitutional standard of high crimes and
misdemeanors that would merit removing him from office and
overturning the will of voters who elected him in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to present, on behalf of the president, a vigorous,
successful, and complete defense,'' said Clinton lawyer Gregory
Craig. ``We are optimistic, we are confident, that the senators. .
.will conclude that the articles do not justify or warrant
conviction or removal from office.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House plan to keep the trial short, argue the facts
agressively, and paint the charges as inventions of an overzealous
prosecution could be put at risk, however, if the Senate votes to
allow witnesses or new evidence in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Witnesses are not in the president's interest,'' said Susan
Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University Law Center.
``Not because they will be so damaging _ some could be quite
sympathetic to him. But because the longer the trial goes, the
harder it will be to predict the outcome. The risk for the White
House is that a prolonged trial that ties up the country will put
pressure on the president to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week's Senate agreement to get the trial under way Thursday
and require votes later on witnesses or new evidence gave the White
House some relief. James Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House
counsel's office, said a speedy trial built on the existing record
is in the ``best interest of the country to get this behind us.
</P>
<P>
   For the White House, the trickiest witness would be Lewinsky,
whose sworn statements before independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr's grand jury have been used by lawyers both for and against
the president. Lewinsky's testimony on the nature of her physical
relationship with the president contradicts his and raised a
perjury charge against him.
</P>
<P>
   On the obstruction of justice charge, Lewinsky's testimony
appears to support Clinton's contention that he did not ask her to
lie about their affair in her affadavit in the Jones case and did
not provide her a job in exchange for her concealing it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet any help Lewinsky could provide the president is more than
offset by the unpredictability of what she might say and how she
would behave while being questioned in the well of the Senate,
legal experts say. Kennedy signaled the White House's caution with
Lewinsky when he denied a published report that Clinton lawyers
were prepared to challenge her credibility as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allowing a vivid narrative of what actually took place between
Lewinsky and Clinton, getting into a `he said, she said' debate on
the Senate floor, is not what the president's defenders want,''
said Jamin Raskin, a law professor at American University. ``It
could end up in a humiliating and not very positive outcome for the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat on the
House Judiciary Committee, said it would be a ``disaster'' if the
Senate trial turned into a highly explicit discussion of ``where
the president touched her and whether he meant to gratify her.''
The risk for the White House, Meehan said, is ``eventually the
American people will get angry about the president and his tawdry
affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, White House lawyers hope to stick to their game plan.
First, they will pound away on the constitutional argument that the
president's alleged wrongdoing does not meet the high standard of
proof of an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is ridiculous, and a dangerous precedent, to think of
removing the president from office because of this sexual
misconduct,'' said Cass Sunstein, a law professor at the University
of Chicago and one of 200 constitutional scholars who signed a
letter advising the House against impeachment. ``The president's
offenses may be legitimate for putting him in jail, but they are
not a legitimate basis for removing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ruff, the White House counsel, is expected to argue in
the trial that the president, whose private and personal conduct he
described to the House Judiciary Committee as ``morally
reprehensible,'' did not abuse his high office, endanger the
nation, or impair his ability to lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to have committed an impeachable offense,'' Ruff told
the committee, ``the president must have acted to subvert our
system of government. That did not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   On another constitutional point, White House lawyers will assert
that the articles, as written, are legally flawed because the are,
at the same time, too complex and too vague. Because the articles
are not specific enough, the senators might not agree on what they
are addressing with votes to convict or acquit.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase of the White House case will be arguing for
acquittal on the specific charges of perjury and obstruction of
justice. In the House, the president's legal team did not assault
the facts of the independent counsel's voluminous report and got
criticized for being too passive. The Senate trial will be
different, Kennedy predicts, as White House lawyers aggressively
challenge evidence as misleading, contradictory, and erroneous in
the `one-sided and prejudicial'' Starr record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can challenge the facts, and we can argue them,'' Kennedy
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the perjury charge, the White House lawyers will argue the
president never intended to lie to the grand jury and did, in fact,
admit to an improper relationship with Lewinsky. But, they say,
Clinton chose his words carefully because he did not want to reveal
the affair and did not believe the intimate activity with Lewinsky
fit the definition of sexual relations provided by US District
Judge Susan Webber Wright in Paula Jones's civil case.
</P>
<P>
   They also will maintain a perjury charge can't be based on
Clinton and Lewinsky's differing versions about their sexual
contact or on ``such insignificant matters'' as the president
``misremembering'' when he began an affair with Lewinsky or him
``understating'' how frequently they met, according to the legal
brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may judge he crossed the line,'' Craig said to the House
Judiciary Committee, describing Clinton's grand jury testimony as
at times ``evasive, incomplete, misleading, even maddening.'' ``But
there is no testimony, no proof, that President Clinton knew he was
wrong and intentionally lied.''
</P>
<P>
   On the obstruction of justice charge, White House lawyers will
tell the Senate that no one who appeared before the Starr grand
jury, including Lewinsky, White House secretary Betty Currie, or
lawyer Vernon E. Jordan Jr., testified that Clinton told them to
lie under oath, instructed them to conceal or retrieve gifts from
Lewinsky, or demanded that Lewinsky be found a job. They will note
the Lewinsky job search started before she was called as a witness
in the Jones case, and that Clinton was giving Lewinsky gifts at
the same time he is alleged to have suggested Lewinsky get rid of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, this inherent contradiction has puzzled
investigations,'' the trial brief said. ``If there was a plot to
conceal these gifts, why did the president give Ms. Lewinsky
several more gifts at the very moment the concelament plan was
lalegedly hatched?''
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde of
Illinois dismissed much of the president's defense as ``legal
hairsplitting and semantic gymnastics.'' But Bloch, the Georgetown
law professor, said she believes the House managers, who will act
as prosecutors in the trial, will have a hard time proving
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is there is no testimony from anyone that nails
the president on it, and on the contrary, there is material that
exonerates him,'' Bloch said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Meehan, Lewinsky's volunteered statement to the
grand jury that ``no one ever told me to lie'' is significant.
``That speaks volumes to the president's innocence on the
obstruction of justice charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the White House lawyers are expected to challenge the
relevancy and fairness of any attempts by the House managers to
depose Kathleen Willey and other women who gave testimony about
Clinton in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are irrelevant. It's too late in the day to attach on
other alleged affairs,'' Raskin said. ``The public won't accept it,
and the Senate would have to squint pretty hard to allow it.''

   NEW YORK _ When critics say it was a mediocre year for music,
that's not the whole story. What they mean to say is that it was a
mediocre year for popular music. With more than 25,000 albums
released last year, the laws of probability predict that at least a
few dozen will fit each taste. The problem is finding them. Record
labels and radio stations often make their decisions based on
trends, genres and lifestyle instead of along purely musical lines.
When the right music is released at the wrong time, it can slip by
unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Below, the pop and jazz critics of The New York Times list some
favorite albums you may not have heard last year. Some are hard to
find because they are on small independent or specialty labels;
others were released only abroad, and a few were neglected by their
own U.S. record companies.
</P>
<P>
   Hunting for some of these records can be an adventure. Here are
a few places to start:
</P>
<P>
   _ Other Music, an independent music record store at 15 E. Fourth
St. in the East Village. Its Web site iswww.othermusic.com &QC;
</P>
<P>
   _ Descarga Records, a Latin mail-order company, at (718)
693-2966 or (800) 377-2647 (www.descarga.com).

meshes a strong, sweet voice and intertwined acoustic guitars for
songs that blend sambas and African pop to draw grace from anguish.
</P>
<P>
   2. Saint Etienne: ``Good Humor'' (Sub Pop). Saint Etienne
anatomizes heartbreak with sleek, breezy pop songs that scramble
styles from the 1950s to the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   3. Rachid: ``Prototype'' (Universal). Skipping any
rhythm-and-blues apprenticeship, the ambitious Rachid heads
directly for the tormented, self-revealing, musically embracing
sphere of idols like Prince and Marvin Gaye.
</P>
<P>
   4. Amon Tobin: ``Permutations'' (Ninja Tune). Fiercely
propulsive, hallucinatory dance tracks from a disk jockey and
producer who knows old jazz as well as new software and who's not
afraid to break away from 4/4 time.
</P>
<P>
   5. Cheri Knight: ``The Northeast Kingdom'' (E-Squared). Country
meets its Celtic heritage in death-haunted songs of love and
strife.
</P>
<P>
   6. Deep Rumba: ``This Night Becomes a Rumba'' (Justin Time).
Using little more than drums and voices, Kip Hanrahan oversees
explosively kinetic music that sends Afro-Cuban rhythms hurtling
into the future.
</P>
<P>
   7. Casa da Mae Joana (Natasha, Brazilian import). Old-fashioned
sambas with an intimate, home-grown spirit from the musicians at a
Rio de Janeiro club where an earlier era lives on.
</P>
<P>
   8. Dr. Israel: ``Inna City Pressure'' (Mutant Sound System).
Fervent roots-reggae melodies top vertiginous jungle tracks for an
inevitable reunion of reggae's dance-floor diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   9. Califone: ``Califone'' (Flydaddy). In songs that clank and
sputter and drone, stray country and blues riffs turn into haunting
riddles.
</P>
<P>
   10. Asian Dub Foundation: ``Rafi's Revenge'' (Slash/London). The
agitprop rants are adequate, but the grooves are spectacular:
dizzying, globe-hopping mixtures of South Asian music, punk-rock,
electronics and reggae.
</P>
<P>
   PETER WATROUS
</P>
<P>
   1. Bloque, ``Bloque'' (Luaka Bop). A mixture of Colombian
rhythms and psychedelia that oddly enough produces images of a
workable musical future, somewhere between rock and older
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   2. Celia Cruz, ``Mi Vida Es Cantar'' (RMM/Descarga). Her best
record in years, in part because the material suits her voice _ one
of the great ones of the 20th century _ and also because the
arrangements work so well.
</P>
<P>
   3. Cuarteto Patria y Manu Dibango, ``Cubafrica''
(Celluloid/Descarga). A beautiful record in the son style made
different by the saxophone of the African musician Manu Dibango.
Against the traditional Cuban acoustic band, he places gorgeous
melodies.
</P>
<P>
   4. Manolito y Su Trabuco, ``Marcando la
Distancia''(Eurotropical/Descarga). A roaring, good-natured dance
record from Havana, one of the few to come out of the Cuban timba
scene this year.
</P>
<P>
   5. Eddie Palmieri, ``Rumbero del Piano'' (RMM/Descarga). His
first dance record in many years is an endlessly satisfying workout
in the New York salsa mold, intelligent and dance friendly.
</P>
<P>
   6. Dede Saint Prix, ``Afro-Caribbean Groove'' (BMG/Declic). An
extremely smart theme album by one of the Caribbean's best groups.
Saint Prix, from Martinique, uses native rhythms, along with ideas
from across the Caribbean; it's rich.
</P>
<P>
   7. Union Sanluisera, ``Charanga'' (Playasound/Descarga). A
basically unknown charanga band from a small town in Cuba, the
group from start to finish demolishes the dance house. Violins riff
away, the flute solos, the chorus sings, and all is well in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   8. The Yoruba/Dahomean Collection, ``Orishas Across the Ocean''
(Ryko/Descarga). Field recordings from Haiti, Brazil, Cuba and
Trinidad, taken from the late 1930s through the late '50s, that
document the Yoruba and Dahomean holdovers that link the musics of
the African diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   9. Viento de Agua, ``De Puerto Rico al Mundo'' (Agogo/Descarga).
A hard-working local band's first record, and it's good. The band
plays bombas and plenas, music from Puerto Rico, and its exuberant
and raucous.
</P>
<P>
   10. Caetano Veloso, ``Livro'' (Polygram). Wildly intelligent and
sensual, and perfectly produced, moving from orchestral works to
minimalist ballads and Brazilian drum workouts. There's nothing
like him in pop music, sophisticated and rhythmic.

PRO CONVICTION: EVIDENCE ADDS UP TO REMOVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is not the finger-wagging speech. It is not the
infamous declaration that ``I did not have sexual relations with
that woman.'' It is not the adultery or even the lies to the
American people. None of these individual acts, even many of
President Clinton's harshest critics say, are impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the case for impeachment is a winding legal staircase,
which must be understood step by step, according to those who
believe that Clinton's actions must lead to his removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the case against the president is the allegation
that Clinton lied before the grand jury when he said his testimony
in an earlier civil case was truthful. Moreover, Clinton tried to
obstruct justice and hide his relationship with former intern
Monica S. Lewinsky, according to the impeachment articles approved
last month by the House.
</P>
<P>
   To those who believe Clinton should be ousted, the evidence is
so overwhelming they can't understand why the public backs Clinton
or why the Senate seems likely to acquit him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is very clear,'' said Representative Bill
McCollum of Florida, one of the 13 House ``managers'' slated to
present the case against Clinton in the Senate impeachment trial.
``He committed the crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice,
and it is very clear these are impeachable offenses. It is an
incredible thought that we would let the president remain in office
if the senators came to the same conclusion that I have.''
</P>
<P>
   McCollum, like several other House managers, said he views the
upcoming trial as a last chance to convince the public that the
case against Clinton has nothing to do with partisanship, but
instead is based on irrefutable evidence and the mandates of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is an attempt to explain the case against Clinton,
according to interviews with House managers and based on the array
of evidence from independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr and the House
Judiciary Committee. The case revolves around two impeachment
articles approved Dec. 19 by the House, finding that Clinton
committed perjury before the grand jury and obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   --Perjury. While the House rejected an impeachment article that
said Clinton lied in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case, it
approved an article that said Clinton lied about many of the same
facts before the federal grand jury. This has complicated matters
for the House managers because in order to prove that Clinton lied
before the grand jury, it must be established that Clinton lied in
the civil case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burden of proof is higher,'' said Representative James
Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, a House manager who is slated to
deliver the opening statement in the Senate trial Thursday. ``We
have to prove he lied twice.'' But Sensenbrenner said it is clear
the lie occurred in both cases.
</P>
<P>
   The lie, according to the Starr report and the House Judiciary
Committee, is that Clinton repeatedly denied having a sexual
relationship with Lewinsky in the civil case. Or, as the
impeachment article puts it, Clinton made ``prior perjurious, false
and misleading testimony in a Federal civil rights action brought
against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defense, according to his lawyers, is that the
definition of sexual relations used in the Jones case did not
include oral sex. However, impeachment backers said even if that is
true, Clinton made other false statements during his testimony. For
example, Clinton denied touching private parts of Lewinsky's body,
which Lewinsky testified did occur.
</P>
<P>
   That has led Democratic critics such as Representative Barney
Frank of Massachusetts to say that the case against Clinton is
based on where he touched Lewinsky. But Sensenbrenner said such
complaints are ludicrous, arguing there is ample proof that Clinton
and Lewinsky agreed to cover up their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the Republican counsel for the House Judiciary
Committee, David Schippers, has said Clinton and Lewinsky were
alone on at least 21 occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had at least 11 personal sexual encounters, excluding
phone sex _ three in 1995, five in 1996 and at least three in
1997,'' Schippers said. ``They had at least 55 telephone
conversations, some of which, at least 17, involved phone sex. The
president gave Ms. Lewinsky 24 presents, and Ms. Lewinsky gave the
president 40 presents.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton gave a very different explanation under oath for a
deposition in the Jones case:
</P>
<P>
   ``Q. At any time were you and Monica Lewinsky alone together in
the Oval Office?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A. I don't recall, but as I said, when she worked at the
legislative affairs office, they always had somebody there on the
weekends. I typically worked some on the weekends. Sometimes they'd
bring me things on the weekends. She _ it seems to me she brought
things to me once or twice on the weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point in the Jones deposition, Clinton said: ``I have
never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. I've never had an
affair with her.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton was asked to explain these answers in his grand
jury testimony, he blamed the Jones attorneys for failing to ask
precise questions. He explained that his answers were based partly
on the tense of the questions. Clinton said, ``In the language I
used, I said, there's nothing going on between us. That was true. I
said I did not have sex with her as I defined it. That was true.''
Asked why he denied being alone with Lewinsky, Clinton explained,
``there were a lot of times when we were alone, but I never really
thought we were.''
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Clinton has not explicitly acknowledged having an
affair or sexual relations with Lewinsky. During his grand jury
testimony, he acknowledged having an inappropriate relationship
with her, and he has said publicly that he has sinned. But he has
not said that he lied in the civil case or before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors, however, argue that Clinton's lies are
self-evident and occurred under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Democrats have said that even if the worst is true _
that Clinton committed perjury before the grand jury _ that is not
necessarily an impeachable offense. Senator Joseph Lieberman, the
Connecticut Democrat, has said he might be able to vote for
acquittal of the president even if he is convinced that Clinton
committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   To Sensenbrenner and other House managers, such reasoning makes
no sense. Sensenbrenner noted that the Constitution says a
president should be impeached for ``treason, bribery, or other high
crimes and misdemeanors.'' Under the federal criminal code,
Sensenbrenner said, ``the penalty for perjury is higher than for
bribery.'' As a result, he said, perjury falls into the category of
other high crimes. Thus, Sensenbrenner said, Clinton must
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   --Obstruction of justice. The second article of impeachment says
Clinton conspired with others to ``impede, cover up and conceal the
existence of evidence and testimony'' in the Jones case. The
article gives seven examples, including the president's effort to
get Lewinsky to sign a sworn affidavit denying that they had a
sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The article also says Clinton tried to keep Lewinsky quiet by
trying to get her a job and by lying himself in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's chief defense is to quote the following testimony from
Lewinsky: ``I would just like to say that no one ever asked me to
lie and I was never promised a job for my silence.''
</P>
<P>
   But whenever the White House quotes this line, it neglects to
supply the rest of the testimony, in which Lewinsky said: ``The
best way to explain how I feel what happened was, you know, no one
asked or encouraged me to lie, but no one discouraged me either.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the discrepancy between these two quotes from Lewinsky
that has led the House managers to conclude that her testimony
before the Senate is crucial. The president's fate could turn on
whether she had an ``understanding'' with Clinton to lie about
their relationship, as impeachment backers have charged.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum said it is incorrect to assume that Clinton can escape
conviction in the Senate. If the House managers are able to present
their case, with witnesses in an open session of the Senate, then
many skeptical Democratic senators might be swayed to vote for
conviction, McCollum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we make a compelling case, it is likely there will
be surprises,'' McCollum said. ``I wouldn't predict it will end in
acquittal.''

 NEW YORK: and rhythmic.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEIL STRAUSS
</P>
<P>
   1. The Beta Band, ``The Three Eps'' (Royal). An eclectic
compilation of bedroom jam pop from a talented new Scottish group
that inhabits its own world, where there is no expressive
difference between a drum machine and a jew's-harp.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Beneath the Surface'' (BTS, Box 10307, Marina del Ray,
Calif. 90295). The best alternative rap release since Dr. Octagon
comes from the producer OD (Omid Walizadeh), who spent two years
gathering vocals from the Los Angeles underground (2Mex, Darkleaf,
Visionaries, Global Phlowtations) into a brilliant, bizarre album
of visionary sci-fi hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   3. Mark Hollis (Polydor U.K.). The first solo album from the
former leader of Talk Talk (the new-wave band that traded pop for
high concept music in the late '80s) further rarefies the emotional
art songs of ``The Spirit of Eden'' with slow, moody and intense
acoustic meditations.
</P>
<P>
   4. Various Artists, ``Au Royanne de Tricatel'' (Tricatel). Here
are high points in France's explosion of lounge music with Bernard
Burgalat, Etienne Charry and Valerie Lemercier contributing to a
compilation for which songs aren't written, they're arranged.
</P>
<P>
   5. Dock Boggs, ``Country Blues'' (Revenant). His voice will
raise goose bumps on your back, his banjo-picking will make you
dizzy and his fatalistic songs will bring a tear to your eye _ and
it was all recorded by a coal miner in the Appalachian mountains 70
years ago. You can continue unearthing Boggs with another new
anthology of his music, ``His Folkways Years, 1963-1968.''
</P>
<P>
   6. Fishmans, ``Long Season'' (Polydor Japan). This one-song
album is actually more than a year old, but it is a defining moment
for this Japanese trio _ a timeless, entrancing exploratory rock
epic. (A short version is on the band's recent live album.)
</P>
<P>
   7. Salako, ``Reinventing Punctuation'' (Jeepster). From the
label that released Belle and Sebastian comes an understated album
of lilting personal pop songs about telepathy and glass-bottom
boats occasionally augmented by skewed electronic dance beats.
</P>
<P>
   8. Michel Chion, ``L'Opera Concret'' (MCE/INA-GRM). Bringing
together street fair and High Mass, the French composer and film
critic excerpts 18 of his musique concrete pieces for an
experimental album that serves both as retrospective and new
composition.
</P>
<P>
   9. D.J. Ed Rush and Optical, ``Wormhole'' (Virus). This British
collaboration breathes new life into drum and bass with a
skitteringly cinematic dance record that builds a dark futurist
jazz out of scraps and throwaways. For an even darker, more
unfettered dance extreme, try ``Twisted Designz'' (Music Cartel) by
Germany's Panacea.
</P>
<P>
   10. Shoutcast (www.shoutcast.com). Lately I've been listening to
a lot of music, not all of it available in stores, at this free
online clearing house for specialty Web radio stations, including a
surprisingly interesting 24-hour-a-day video game music channel,
live concerts by bands famous and obscure, unreleased movie
soundtracks.
</P>
<P>
   BEN RATLIFF
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Ethiopiques, Vols. 1 and 3: Golden Years of Modern
Ethiopian Music 1969-1975'' (Buda). Transfixing soul and funk by
state-sponsored bands: something like James Brown with microtonal
African wails and pentatonic scales.
</P>
<P>
   2. Wessell (Warmdaddy) Anderson, ``Live at the Village
Vanguard'' (Leaning House). A good-natured jazz house party led by
an alto and soprano saxophonist with serious rhythmic bounce and a
muscular, sharpshooting tone.
</P>
<P>
   3. Reid Anderson Quartet, ``Dirty Show Tunes'' (Fresh Sound). A
debut by a young jazz bass player who writes witty, thoughtful,
sweet-and-sour small-group music.
</P>
<P>
   4. Johnny Society, ``Wood'' (Messenger). With a bar-band Beatle
voice and an unpretentious, utilitarian imagination, Kenny Siegal
writes perfect little agonized rock songs.
</P>
<P>
   5. Ravi Coltrane, ``Moving Pictures'' (RCA/BMG). As powerful as
it is unassuming, a saxophonist's debut jazz record explores short,
simple themes; the drummer Jeff Watts particularly shines.
</P>
<P>
   6. Waldemar Bastos, ``Pretaluz'' (Luaka Bop). Heart-rending
ballads and a few upbeat dance-rhythms by an Angolan refugee living
in Lisbon whose voice is a bullhorn of loss.
</P>
<P>
   7. Pluramon, ``Render Bandits'' (Mille Plateaux). A great
rock-with-abstract-electronics record, beautifully produced by
Markus Schmickler, but the star is the remarkable Jaki Liebezeit,
former drummer of the German group Can.
</P>
<P>
   8. Avishai Cohen, ``Adama'' (Stretch/Concord). A young jazz
bassist with a natural leader's commanding tone and a compositional
idee fixe: Sephardic jazz.
</P>
<P>
   9. Meshuggah, ``Chaosphere'' (Nuclear Blast America).
Self-consciously tricky, polyrhythmic heavy metal by a group of
hard-as-nails Swedes _ the most musicianly of metal bands.
</P>
<P>
   10. Radian: ``Radian'' (Rhiz). Scratchy, staticky noises by an
Austrian electronic trio, accompanied by real bass and drums, which
give it a delicious tension.
</P>
<P>
   ANN POWERS
</P>
<P>
   1. Dana and Karen Kletter, ``Dear Enemy'' (Hannibal). The voices
of the Kletter twins intertwine like strands of DNA as they
excavate secrets from the heart of family life, in pristine
settings crafted by the legendary pop-folk producer Joe Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   2. Slapp Happy, ``Ca Va'' (V2). Art rock never sounded so
elegant: the long-missed trio of Dagmar Krause, Anthony Moore and
Peter Blegvad return with an acerbic and dreamy collection of
rueful reminiscences and daring fancies.
</P>
<P>
   3. Tom Freund, ``North American Long Weekend'' (Red Ant). This
young singer-songwriter joins the long line of artists giving voice
to the disgruntled, romantic common man, and his tunefulness and
gruff heart help him cut to the front.
</P>
<P>
   4. Iva Bittova (Nonesuch). A truly singular artist, this Czech
violinist and singer performs her magical story-songs solo; her
astonishingly evocative voice and style conjure a new world with
its own gravitational pull.
</P>
<P>
   5. Lhasa, ``La Llorona'' (Atlantic). Call her the Edith Piaf of
Nafta, this American-born, Spanish-speaking resident of Montreal is
thoroughly modern in her syncretic approach to pop, and classic in
her florid, imperious singing.
</P>
<P>
   6. Shudder to Think, ``First Love, Last Rites: Music from the
Motion Picture'' (Epic/Sony). An eccentrically ambitious
underground rock band finds the ideal form for its ideas with this
soundtrack, which features guest vocalists like Liz Phair and the
late Jeff Buckley belting it out on hits from an imaginary radio.
</P>
<P>
   7. Mimi, ``Soak'' (Luaka Bop). Mimi Goese is an avant-garde diva
with the reassuring voice of a big sister; here, she pushes her
wandering philosophies into new shapes inspired by the electronic
landscapes of her longtime collaborator, Hahn Rowe.
</P>
<P>
   8. Diane Izzo, ``One'' (Sugar Free) This Chicago-based rocker's
influences _ mainly Patti Smith and P.J. Harvey _ still lead her,
but this vivid debut suggests that she may be rock's next
prophetess.
</P>
<P>
   9. The Henrys, ``Desert Cure'' (Trainrec/Canadian Arts Council).
Don Rooke's work on various slide guitars, from the kona to the lap
steel to something called a sonar zombie, recalls the erudite
ramblings of Bill Frisell. This ensemble (which sometimes includes
the vocalist Mary Margaret O'Hara) surrounds his playing with
sunset tones.
</P>
<P>
   10. Ozomatli, ``Ozomatli'' (Almo Sounds). The real sound of
California is the specialty of this multiracial crew as it blends
cumbia with hip-hop in a joyous free-for-all straight out of East
Los Angeles.

CLINTON HOPEFUL SENATE WILL DO `THE RIGHT THING' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Wednesday he was hopeful
that the Senate would do ``the right thing'' and acquit him of all
charges as House prosecutors prepared to make their case Thursday
in only the second presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking his silence of the last few weeks on the issue, Clinton
declined to comment directly on the perjury and obstruction of
justice charges against him, saying he will leave it to his lawyers
to make the case for why the 42nd president should not be removed
from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing for me is to spend as little time thinking
about that as possible,'' Clinton told reporters, on the eve of the
Senate convening to hear oral arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added that he plans to focus on other important issues
as his trial unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the brief speaks for itself, and the statements
which have been made by hundreds of constitutional experts and
others ... that this matter was not the subject of impeachment,''
he said. ``I trust that the right thing will be done. And I think,
in the meanwhile, I need to work on the business of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the comments shortly after White House lawyers
delivered to the Senate a 130-page brief rebutting point-by-point
the charges as outlined in the two articles of impeachment that the
House approved along party lines last month.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief, Clinton's defense team stuck to its contention
that the case against the president stems from an extramarital
sexual affair that under normal circumstances would have been kept
private and includes charges that are unconstitutionally vague and
ought to be dismissed outright.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers argued that the Senate ``has an obligation to turn
away an unwise and unwarranted misuse of the awesome power of
impeachment,'' which they insisted the nation's founding fathers
intended should be used only ``in the gravest circumstances, when
the stability of our system of government hung in the balance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Senate removes this president for a wrongful
relationship he hoped to keep private, for what will the House ask
the Senate to remove the next president, and the next?'' they
continued. They also contended that the House impeachment
proceedings were too `` partisan'' and ``unfair'' to even warrant a
trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Removing the president on these facts would substantially
alter the delicate constitutional balance and move us closer to a
quasi-parliamentary system in which the president is elected by the
choice of the people, but continues in office only at the pleasure
of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   They also called on the senators to consider ``the will and
interests of the people'' in their deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not simply the president, but the vote of the American
people rendered in schools, church halls and other civic centers
all across the land 26 months ago, that is hanging in the
balance,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate filing with the Senate, the 13-member House
prosecution team, which is made up of Republicans, issued a short
response to the White House defense argument that the case is
essentially about a private sexual affair. The prosecution team
insisted that Clinton should be removed from office, not for the
affair he had with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, but
for lying under oath about it and trying to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of the articles of impeachment warrant the conviction,
removal from office and disqualification from holding further
office of President William Jefferson Clinton,'' the prosecution
team wrote.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors also delivered to the Senate much of the
evidence and other supporting documentation that independent
counsel Kenneth Starr sent to them last September when he filed his
report outlining impeachable offenses against the president.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks to reporters, Clinton stressed that he intends to
continue with his plans to deliver the State of the Union address
next Tuesday, despite the fact that it will take place on the same
day his lawyers are scheduled to begin their oral presentation on
the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion is that I should be doing my job for the country,
and other people should be handling the defense and dealing with
this issue. And that's what I intend to do,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He also indicated that he does not plan to mention the
impeachment proceedings during his address because most Americans
have heard ``quite extensively'' about it already.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they would like it if somebody up here were putting
their interests first ... and I think that's what they expect me to
do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of senators have urged him to postpone the annual
speech to a joint session of Congress and the nation, saying it
would be ``awkward'' for it to take place on the same day his
lawyers present their case against impeachment. In an effort to
avoid a conflict with the trial, some senators have also urged
their leaders to postpone the opening of Clinton's defense
presentation by one day to allow the State of the Union address to
take place Jan. 19, as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   But an aide to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said
Republicans were not prepared ``at this point'' to interrupt the
trial schedule.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors will begin their opening arguments at Thursday
afternoon, marking only the second time that a presidential
impeachment trial has taken place in the Senate. The last time was
in 1868 when President Andrew Johnson was acquitted of charges
against him by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   A two-thirds vote will be needed to convict Clinton and oust him
from office. But few senators have indicated that House prosecutors
will be able to persuade 67 of them to vote for conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Still, following a tour of the Senate chamber Wednesday, the
prosecutors said the case for removal can be made successfully if
senators give careful consideration to the facts and the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our case is very solid if people will listen,'' said
Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who will take part in the opening
statements Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., also said
that senators will be better informed once they get the ``full
picture'' of what Clinton did from the prosecution's
``comprehensive presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for the opening arguments, two long, curved
tables were set up on the floor of the Senate on Wednesday. Each
table can accommodate up to 15 people from each side.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors will have 24 hours over the next three
days to present their case. Clinton's lawyers will get the same
amount of time next week to present their defense.
</P>
<P>
   Senate officials Wednesday issued rules of conduct for the 100
senators, who were sworn in as jurors last week. They are expected
to attend all sessions and to refrain from extraneous reading at
their seats. The senators, accustomed to speaking their minds
whenever they want, will also be required to remain seated and
silent until conclusion of the arguments. They then will be
required to submit questions in writing through Chief Justice
William Rehnquist, who is presiding over the trial.

 &HT;    WITNESS: MICROSOFT LACKS MONOPOLY POWER
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In opening its defense Wednesday against antitrust
charges, Microsoft Corp. called as its first witness an economist
who held that the software giant's Windows operating system did not
give it monopoly power over personal computer desktops.
</P>
<P>
   The view taken by Massachusetts Institute of Technology
economics professor Richard Schmalansee appeared to astound David
Boies, the government's lead attorney, as he began what promises to
be a lengthy cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   In bringing the landmark case, the government asserted that
Microsoft has illegally wielded its monopoly power by seeking to
extend its hold to the Internet while crushing its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's underlying power _ which is not illegal and
which is based on the fact that Windows runs on more than 90
percent of newly shipped personal computers _ had not been an issue
until Schmalansee took the stand.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, dean of MIT's Sloan School of Management, insisted
that Microsoft does not have a monopoly because its operating
system dominance is threatened by companies that could produce
rival technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree that (Windows) is a relevant market,''
Schmalansee told Boies. ``It makes no sense analytically. There are
developers out there writing for other platforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmalansee argued that such operating systems as Linux and
Beos, both of which run, along with Windows, on Intel-based
machines, were waiting in the wings as potential competitors, ready
to pounce on Microsoft's most valued turf. Even hand-held units,
such as those that run the Palm system, are ``competitors to
Windows,'' Schmalansee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you really mean to tell the judge that this hand-held
system is now a serious competitor to Windows?'' Boies asked
Schmalansee in an incredulous tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``My answer is no,''' Schmalansee replied, seemingly backing off
a bit. ``But it is the germ of a potential competitor. To rule it
out is to have a constricted view of the fluidity of this
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In filing 328 pages of testimony, Schmalansee wrote on page 250:
``Whatever one believes about Microsoft's power in the 'market' for
PC operating systems, the Windows desktop is surely not a relevant
market _ any more than the exterior of a Coke can is a 'market.' It
is only one of many effective channels of software distribution and
promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept of a ``relevant market'' is central to all antitrust
law. Unless the courts find that such a market in fact exists, a
finding that any company wields monopoly power, let alone abuses
that power by seeking to dominate other markets, cannot be made.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 states allege that Microsoft holds
a monopoly in the operating system for personal computers that it
has preserved and attempted to extend illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing Schmalansee's views, Boies said outside the
courtroom: ``It's like they used to say at the top in the former
Soviet Union that they were a democracy. They are not around
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmalansee took the stand after U.S. District Court Judge
Thomas Penfield
</P>
<P>
   Jackson denied a motion by Microsoft to dismiss antitrust
charges at the mid-point of the trial, now in its 11th week.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the ruling means that the government can now put on
its case. Since Jackson insisted that all testimony be submitted in
advance in written form, the Microsoft trial has taken place in
reserve, with nearly all the time being taken up by
cross-examination of hostile witnesses.

SOLDIER-OF-MISFORTUNE (Phoenix) - It was only a matter time before
the so-called ``Soldier of Misfortune,'' Bobby Joe Keesee, would
strike again. After all, the former Korean War hero was out of
prison again. In between terms, Keesee had stolen a plane while
stationed at Fort Huachuca and flown to Cuba, hijacked a plane in
Thailand and flew to North Vietnam during the war, killed a U.S.
diplomat in northern Mexico in a foiled ransom attempt and, more
recently, been involved in financial scams. So, when Lake Havasu
City boatman Harry Christensen placed an ad on the internet trying
to sale his airplane and Keesee arranged a test flight, you figure
that something would happen. It did. Christensen apparently was
killed by Keesee during the flight to Albuquerque. Keesee and his
wife have been arrested, but Christensen's body still hasn't been
found. By MARK SHAFFER. Story will move in the ``A' category. &QL;

CLINTON-AZNOTES (Phoenix) - The crisp morning air nips at the
children's cheeks, making them ruddy. But the kids running about
the Kyrene de Los Cerritos playground aren't bothered by it at all.
A mother takes in the scene from the playground gate and marvels at
the innocent faces. But already, the presidential scandal is taking
its toll. ``Look at them. They don't have a care in the world,''
says Roberta, who has a daughter in kindergarten. ``But the other
night, my daughter asked if her daddy would cheat on us like
President Clinton did on his family. I didn't even know she knew
what cheating was.''

LEGAL-OBSESSION (Phoenix) - Years ago, the Span family of Phoenix
was known as a group of gritty strivers who invested their hopes
and sweat in the future of Phoenix. Now, in the halls of Maricopa
County Superior Court, they are known for their strange obsession
with suing the city, alleging cover-ups and conspiracy related to
the condemning of their property in 1988. Their lives revolve
around their court cases. They have filed tens of thousands of
papers in court. They spend their days preparing filings and
meeting court deadlines. In between, they crash from exhaustion.
They are even suffering from what one lawyer calls `legal abuse
syndrome.'' By VICTORIA HARKER. Story will move in the ``A''

NOTARO-COLUMN (Phoenix) - As I looked at the letter in my hand from
the city of Phoenix that I received several weeks ago, my blood
began to bubble. It explained that a complaint had been filed
against my front yard, claiming that it contained an inordinate
amount of trash and overgrown weeds. On a hunch, I sought out all
of my neighbors and discovered, not to my surprise, that we had all
received the same letter on the same day. There could be only one
culprit, I decided. It had to be the Neighborhood Nemesis, or, as
he likes to call himself, the president of the neighborhood
association _ a man who doesn't even have a yard, only a small

   Expect infinite paeans to His Airness, the man/god in the red

WHITE HOUSE PURSUES STRATEGY OF CONCILIATION TOWARD SENATE
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-LEGAL, IMPEACH-HOUSE,
IMPEACH-SCENE.) 
(nk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Wednesday that he intended
to spend as little time as possible thinking about his impeachment
trial, choosing instead to do the work of the people, who he says
have already heard more than enough about impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate begins its trial in earnest on Thursday with
opening statements from House prosecutors, Clinton's aides say he
remains relatively uninvolved in his defense against charges that
could end his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has kept up a full public schedule and spent time
preparing for the State of the Union address next week _ acting, in
short, as if some other president were on trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, asked by a reporter at a social engagement last month
how it felt to be impeached, responded, ``Not bad.'' The president
expressed confidence that future historians would consider his
impeachment only a minor blot on his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief session with reporters before a meeting Wednesday
with labor leaders, Clinton said, ``The important thing for me is
to spend as little time thinking about that as possible and as much
time working on the issues we're here to discuss as possible. They
have their job to do in the Senate, and I have mine, and I intend
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of presidential detachment is one prong of a
White House strategy that has emerged in recent days as the Senate
opens the first impeachment trial of a president in 131 years.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of employing a combination of delay and defiance in
response to the investigations of Kenneth W. Starr, the independent
counsel, and the House Judiciary Committee, the White House has
adopted a markedly more conciliatory tone toward the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The president and his advisers hope that the bipartisanship
shown in the 100-to-0 vote on trial procedures last week will
survive as the trial continues over the next several weeks. To that
end, White House officials are careful to offer only praise for
Senate leaders, so as not to appear to be meddling with the
president's jury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was asked whether he thought the charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice against him were warranted. He replied, ``My
opinion is not important here. My opinion is that I should be doing
my job for the country and other people should be handling the
defense and dealing with this issue, and that's what I intend to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton strives to present an image of unconcern about the
proceeding unfolding in the Senate, his lawyers and aides are
approaching the members of his jury with a deference they did not
show his inquisitors in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're treating the Senate with more gravity, absolutely,''
said Paul Begala, senior adviser to the president, ``because they
are approaching this just as the framers of the Constitution would
have wanted, by setting aside partisanship, proposing a process
that allows us a fair chance to state our case.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the White House has not announced how it intends to
present its case over three days next week, officials are
considering adding some new faces to the now-familiar legal team
that argued the president's brief before the House.
</P>
<P>
   The group will be led by Charles F.C. Ruff, the White House
counsel, Gregory B. Craig, coordinator of the president's
impeachment defense, and David E. Kendall, Clinton's chief private
lawyer. But officials are considering using several younger, less
combative members of the defense team to present a gentler face to
the Senate. These lawyers include Nicole K. Seligman, a partner of
Kendall, and Lanny A. Breuer and Cheryl D. Mills of the White House
counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   But the deferential treatment of the Senate does not extend to
the House and its prosecution team, known as impeachment managers.
White House officials continue a campaign of vitriol against House
Republicans, who engineered last month's vote on two articles of
impeachment along near-party lines.
</P>
<P>
   In a trial brief filed with the Senate Wednesday, Clinton's
lawyers describe last month's House vote as ``an unwise and
unwarranted misuse of the awesome power of impeachment'' that
threatened the country's democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The brief accuses the House of ignoring the will of the people
and seeking to subvert the result of two national elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``In weighing the evidence and assessing the facts, we ask that
Senators consider not only the intent of the framers but also the
will and interests of the people,'' the president's lawyers write.
``It is the citizens of these United States who will be affected by
and stand in judgment of this process. It is not simply the
president _ but the vote the American people rendered in schools,
church halls and other civic centers all across the land 26 months
ago _ that is hanging in the balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the president's press secretary, described the
House prosecutors' trial brief as reading like a ``cheap mystery
novel'' and called the entire process that led to the president's
impeachment on Dec. 19 ``illegitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart's remarks were part of a continuing strategy to paint
the charges against the president as the politically-inspired work
of a rogue independent counsel and a Republican-dominated House.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you read their document,'' Lockhart said of the House
summary of its case against the president, ``you start to
understand the weakness of their case. People who have strong
factual case argue the facts. If you don't have the facts, you
employ plots and subplots and sinister mysteries.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Lockhart continued, ``I think the Senators have
distinguished themselves as able to act in a bipartisan way to
date, clearly distinguishing them from House. There's no big
mystery about our strategy here. As long as they continue their
bipartisanship, we'll treat them accordingly.''

MUSTANG TURNS INTO A STUD  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, JAN. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Ford stylists decided to play the retro card with the
(mostly) new 1999 Mustang, celebrating the 35th anniversary of the
original pony car with a nod to the past.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ford engineers were refining this old-style muscle
car into a thoroughly modern automobile, making it tighter, quicker
and generally more fun to be with.
</P>
<P>
   All I have to say is: sheesh, 35 years? Why, it was only
yesterday that my buddies and I were careening around the
neighborhood in a slightly used '66 Mustang convertible complete
with a 289 V-8 and the coveted pony interior.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not yesterday. Maybe it was a long time ago that
Ford took the chassis of its compact Falcon and created a new kind
of funmobile. Unveiled midyear, the 1964{ Mustang was cheerful and
youth-oriented, an all-American that combined the aura of a sports
car with the practicality of a small, inexpensive four-seater.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, Mustang also became Ford's imagemaker and perennial
performance machine. And, aside from a mid-'70s detour as the
crumby, downsized Mustang II, it has stayed the course.
</P>
<P>
   To recapture the look and style of the original, the designers
took the existing body and adorned it with sharper character lines,
fake hood and side scoops (that's (begin ital) so (end ital) '60s),
taillights that mimic the three-bar lights of the original 1964{, a
Mustang emblem that resembles the one in the original grille, and a
'60s-looking 35th anniversary badge stuck on the front fenders.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a new look for Mustang, the beveled edges, rounded
flanks and glowering headlights bringing it crisply up to date. And
compared with the archaic suspension and handling of our '66 model,
the new Mustang brings the breed into focus as a car that performs
as good as it looks.
</P>
<P>
   That includes upgraded power for the overhead-cam, 4.6-liter V-8
in the GT test car. This smooth, sophisticated mill, which replaced
the raucous 5-liter pushrod V-8 that faded away a couple years ago,
has been boosted to 260 horsepower, 35 more than last year.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not in the power game, Mustang also comes with an
upgraded 3.8-liter V-6 that's been kicked up 40 horsepower to 190.
This is how most Mustangs will be equipped, because enough power is
still there, and the price tag is about $4,000 less than a
comparable V-8.
</P>
<P>
   The enhanced V-8 brings Mustang GT's acceleration more into line
with archrival Chevrolet Camaro Z-28. The extra oomph is noticeable
especially from a standstill, when the Mustang hunkers down and
takes off with a hot-rod roar. Most satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of an overhead-cam engine, it lacks the massive low-end
torque of pushrod models, but soars mightily into the upper rev
range, picking up power as it climbs.
</P>
<P>
   If you require more, there's the limited-edition Mustang SVT,
with 320 horsepower stuffed under the hood, thanks to reworked
cylinder heads with a total of 32 valves instead of 16, and some
intake- and exhaust-system redesign.
</P>
<P>
   If that's (begin ital) still (end ital) not enough, wait until
April, when the new Cobra is due. The engine's the same as the SVT,
but the Cobra will boast Mustang's first-ever independent rear
suspension for better handling and overall finesse.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the Mustang GT's handling feels more supple and better
controlled than last year's. Credit goes to many incremental
suspension refinements, including about an inch-longer spring
travel to smooth the road, and quicker steering with a smaller
turning radius to straighten out curves.
</P>
<P>
   Our tester was outfitted with 16-inch performance tires;
17-inchers are available. In curves and quick maneuvers, the
Mustang remains poised and controllable, feeling nicely balanced.
</P>
<P>
   A quick run along a twisting desert road was a romp, though in
some tight turns at speed, the Mustang tends to feel heavy.
Advanced traction control keeps everything nicely tucked in, and
the four-wheel disc brakes are highly effective.
</P>
<P>
   The body of the convertible has been strengthened with box-rail
extensions to fight body flex and shake, and new motor mounts for
the V-8 to increase stiffness.
</P>
<P>
   Shakes, rattles and heaves are a lot less noticeable in the new
Mustang than in any of its predecessors. That '66 convertible shook
like a wet dog over rough surfaces, and later models weren't much
better.
</P>
<P>
   The hydraulic top works nicely, but the boot cover for the
folded top is a fussy affair that's destined to remain in the
trunk. Top down, cruising is pure hedonistic delight.
</P>
<P>
   The engine roar is another issue. The drone of the sporty
exhaust system becomes tiresome and intrusive, especially coupled
to an automatic transmission, as was our test car (five-speed stick
is available).
</P>
<P>
   The interior is nice, if plain, with decent space for front-seat
occupants. The driver's seat seems to have more legroom, which it
desperately needed. Passengers in the rear need to be considerably
smaller than adult scale _ a standard complaint with Mustang
convertibles.
</P>
<P>
   The trunk is small and shallow, another Mustang tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 Mustang is well-priced across the board, with V-6 coupes
starting at just over $16,000 and lavishly equipped GT convertibles
like our tester just over $27,000.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of style for the money. Especially now that it has
the performance to match. &QL;

 &HT;    ON EVE OF SENATE TRIAL, CLINTON SAYS HE'S FOCUSING ON HIS JOB

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of opening arguments in the Senate trial
that threatens his office, President Clinton broke weeks of silence
on the matter to say he has largely delegated his fate to his legal
staff while he carries on with the job of running the country.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating the point, Clinton's 11-person legal team filed a
130-page brief countering the charges against him, as House
prosecutors filed their own five-page brief reiterating the
allegations. Neither filing broke significant new ground.
</P>
<P>
   A key unresolved matter in the Senate trial is whether to allow
witnesses, but the House Judiciary Committee contacted Monica
Lewinsky's lawyers to see if she would be available for an
interview, said committee spokesman Paul J. McNulty. He said
lawyers for the former White House intern declined to make her
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Committee is duty-bound to gather all relevant evidence
and to be thoroughly prepared to present its case in the Senate,''
McNulty said. ``Implicit in the House's right to request witnesses
is the responsibility of the managers to determine who those
witnesses will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, CNN reported that two of the 13 House ``managers''
met this week with Kathleen Willey, a potential witness in the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The managers were interested in discussing alleged efforts by
the president's supporters to suppress Willey's claim that Clinton
fondled her in a room off the Oval Office, CNN said, citing sources
who were present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   As trial preparations continued, the president spent the day at
work on issues ranging from his upcoming State of the Union address
to the latest economic meltdown, this time in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ''My opinion is that I should be doing my job for the country,
and other people should be handling the defense and dealing with
this issue,'' Clinton said after a reporter asked him about his
views on the Senate impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''The important thing for me is to spend as little time thinking
about that as possible,'' Clinton said. ''I need to work on the
business of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   With the capital poised for arguments to begin in the first
Senate trial of a president in 130 years, Clinton plans to pay
little attention to the televised proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he's got a packed schedule Thursday, beginning with a
meeting likely to focus on Iraq with his national security adviser,
Samuel Berger, a morning event in nearby Alexandria, Va., to
spotlight administration efforts to put more police on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   As House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., kicks
off the prosecution's opening arguments at 1 p.m. EST before the
Senate, with Chief Justice of the United States William H.
Rehnquist wielding the gavel, Clinton is scheduled to be in an Oval
Office meeting with senior aides _ ostensibly, at least, to work on
the State of the Union address he plans to give before Congress
next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to leave town late Thursday for an
overnight trip to New York, where he'll go to Wall Street to
discuss ideas for making capitalism work better for the nation's
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton virtually ruled out the prospect that he might address
his personal predicament as part of his State of the Union speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the American people have heard about that quite
extensively over the last year,'' Clinton said. ''I think they
would like it if somebody up here would put their interests first,
their business first, and I think that's what they expect me to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton, ''We have to deal with the problems of America,
the challenges of America, the opportunities of America, and that's
what I intend to do in the State of the Union speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the remarks in response to reporters' questions
during a brief photo opportunity at the opening of a meeting with
labor leaders in the Cabinet Room.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time he has fielded press inquiries on the
subject of his impeachment since a press conference in Jerusalem in
mid-December, a week before the House voted to impeach him for
perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of either charge by a two-thirds majority in the
Senate, an outcome that appeared remote as of Wednesday, Clinton
would be required to leave office immediately and turn his
administration over to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was closed on Wednesday as its chamber was readied
for opening arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Television monitors were installed for the first time ever near
the richly paneled walls at the rear of the chamber, and a single
television camera was set up on the chamber's floor, another first.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 House members elected to act as floor managers for the
trial will have up to 24 hours to make their case, a process
expected to stretch out over Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Monday, Clinton's defense team _ a battery of 11
lawyers from the White House counsel's office and the private law
firm of Williams &AMP; Connolly _ would have an equal period of time to
rebut the charges and mount their defense.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments, from both sides, would be limited to the evidence
contained in the 7,000-page report the House presented to the
Senate to support its allegations that Clinton committed perjury
and obstruction of justice in connection with the Monica Lewinsky
sex-and-deception scandal that first surfaced a year ago this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the legal brief filed by Clinton's lawyers nor the brief
filed Wednesday by House prosecutors broke major new ground.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers amplified and detailed their contention that
none of the House charges rises to the level of ''high crimes and
misdemeanors'' the Constitution regards as impeachable offenses,
and that he is not guilty of the alleged charges in any event.
</P>
<P>
   The House brief claims precisely the opposite, stating
emphatically that ''each and every allegation in Articles I and II
is true and that Articles I and II properly state impeachable
offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the White House argument that the charges should be
dismissed after the scheduled arguments, the House brief contends
that the Constitution does not provide for dismissal, only for a
vote on whether to convict.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers insisted that the standard for conviction
should be evidence that is convincing ''beyond reasonable doubt,''
the highest standard applicable under conventional criminal trials.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, however, is not bound by such conventions. Indeed,
the Senate may vote to remove Clinton from office even if he is
found guilty of no specific crime, provided that a two-thirds
majority votes that he is guilty of one or more of the articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   As they have before, Clinton's lawyers made the case that the
allegations before the Senate do not justify removing the president
from office.
</P>
<P>
   ''The gravity of what is at stake _ the democratic choice of the
people _ and the solemnity of the proceedings dictate that a
decision to remove the President from office should follow only
from the most serious of circumstances and should be done in
conformity with Constitutional standards and in the interest of the
Nation and its people,'' Clinton's lawyers argued.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Articles of Impeachment that have been exhibited to the
Senate fall far short of what the Founding Fathers had in mind when
they placed in the hands of the Congress the power to impeach and
remove a President from office,'' they said.

<P>
   CORPACANCHA, Peru _ Claudencia Martin Gustavo cheered when
President Alberto K. Fujimori, defying the thin mountain air in
this remote village 12,000 feet above sea level, took two women
into his arms and twirled them in a vigorous Indian folk dance.
</P>
<P>
   He cheered as the president passed out pink blouses and beige
pants to local llama and alpaca herders. And he cheered again when
the Peruvian leader, already in campaign mode, donned a rather
unpresidential poncho, and talked about bringing telephones and
electricity to this settlement of 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   But Gustavo said he doubted he would vote a third time for
Fujimori next year because ``we don't have enough food and our
incomes are not enough for our families.''
</P>
<P>
   A deepening recession caused by stormy weather and the Asian
economic crisis has swung Peru's political mood against the
president who has dominated this country for nearly a decade. Once
widely popular for rescuing Peru from the abyss of terrorism,
cocaine trafficking and hyperinflation, Fujimori is struggling to
recapture his old magic that has brought him two election
victories. Whether he can regain it will determine if he will run
again next year.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Japanese immigrants, Fujimori bolted out of nowhere
as an independent populist to win the presidency in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But he governed as a tough-minded, free-market conservative.
Faced with a spreading wave of terrorism, he unleashed the military
and intelligence services and quickly captured the most important
rebel leaders. He even ordered the air force to shoot down planes
loaded with Peruvian coca paste destined for Colombia leading to a
rapid decline in trafficking and coca cultivation.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Fuji-shock,'' treatment yielded a wave of privatizations
of inefficient state enterprises and attracted foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
   And with crucial military support, he replaced the Congress and
Supreme Court in 1992, with like-minded officials. His actions drew
heavy criticism from the United States and human rights activists,
but the terrorists lost ground and Fujimori won re-election
overwhelmingly in 1995 over former United Nations Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar.
</P>
<P>
   But now the 60-year-old president's support in the polls, which
has risen and fallen in the past, has dwindled to about 35 percent,
and has hardly budged over the last four months.
</P>
<P>
   His popularity has declined even after he successfully
negotiated a peace treaty with Ecuador late last year, forcing him
to replace his prime minister and shuffle his Cabinet last week. A
frightening crime wave in Lima early last year abated after
Fujimori ordered Peru's intelligence services to infiltrate street
gangs and arrest their leaders, but even that has not helped his
standing.
</P>
<P>
   While he has not signaled his political intentions, his
supporters say he is privately gearing up to run again. But some
analysts say that if his polls do not improve in the next six to
eight months, Fujimori may decide to forego the election.
</P>
<P>
   His standing has deteriorated mainly owing to a recession that
resulted first from El Nino, which caused major flood damage and
pushed important varieties of fish from Peru's shoreline, causing
hardship for the country's substantial fishmeal industry.
</P>
<P>
   A decline in commodities prices brought on by the Asian crisis,
especially for Peru's copper and tin, has reduced economic growth.
Indeed, the once white-hot Peruvian economy that registered
double-digit growth rates in the early 1990's stalled to zero
growth in the last quarter. The unemployment and underemployment
rate has risen in recent months from 40 percent to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are hungry, unemployed and tired of Fujimori,''
said Javier Valle Riestra, who served as prime minister for two
months last year. ``He can only make it to re-election by fraud and
blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has been buffeted by widespread criticism that he
manipulated the courts and electoral tribunals to sidestep a
constitutional ban on a third term. Fujimori's claims that his 1992
``self-coup'' improved the justice system has been tarnished in
recent months by scandals, including two judges recently filmed
taking bribes from drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   And a new book about Vladimiro Montesinos, Fujimori's unofficial
chief of intelligence, describes the president as a virtual
prisoner of a sinister, power-hungry spy. The book has become an
instant best-seller sold at newsstands around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori cannot be counted out, however. The Ministry of the
Presidency controls 40 percent of the national budget, and it is
already turning on a pork-barrel spigot for bridges and roads. And
the opposition remains splintered. The strongest possible
opposition candidate, Alberto Andrade, was recently re-elected
mayor of Lima, but his organization is weak in the provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, opinion polls and political analysts suggest that
the brief surge Fujimori received in 1997 by the rescue operation
of 71 hostages held by terrorists in the Japanese ambassador's
residence has faded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say re-election is possible, but very difficult,''
said Alfredo Torres, a leading Lima poll taker. ``The question is
whether the recuperation of the Peruvian and world economy will
come fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Fujimori predicted that his new Cabinet
would help his government recover much of its luster. He said he
would be able to crank up economic growth by better the 5 percent
this year _ far higher than the consensus 2 percent of independent
economists _ unless neighboring Brazil suffers a complete economic
meltdown. Things will be better, he said, if for no other reason
than there will be not be an El Nino this year.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori made many promises, as he doodled on a piece of paper
in a wood-paneled office in the government palace. He pledged to
further reduce Peru's coca-growing area _ already cut by more than
half in three years thanks partly to eradication _ by an additional
20 to 30 percent this year. He predicted that the new treaty with
Ecuador would lead to yearly savings of $400 million in military
spending. And he promised to hunt down the handful of rebels left
in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before there was terrorism, now there is stability,'' Fujimori
said, as if practicing a campaign speech. ``Before we had economic
chaos, now we have order. Before we were isolated internationally,
now we have friends again. Before we had conflict with Ecuador, now
we live in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   He refused to rule out a re-election bid, adding, ``I don't have
to decide yet.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   But for the last two years, Fujimori and his allies who form a
majority in Congress have been acting as if the Peruvian leader
intends to run in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 Peruvian Constitution prohibits the president from
running for a third consecutive term. But in August 1996,
Fujimori's supporters in Congress passed a law that granted him an
exception, arguing that his first term did not count since it began
before the new constitution was written.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the opposition appealed to the seven-member
Constitutional Tribunal, saying the exemption was unconstitutional.
Three of the judges agreed, three abstained, and the head
constitutional judge upheld the 3-0 decision against Fujimori. In
May 1997, Congress dismissed the three judges who opposed their law
on the ground that they had exceeded their authority, opening the
way for a third Fujimori campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition mounted a signature drive to petition Congress to
hold a national referendum on the issue of a third term.
</P>
<P>
   By July 1998, it had collected enough signatures to hold a
referendum. But the Congress ruled that two-thirds of its members
would have to clear the way for any referendum, and Fujimori's
majority blocked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do not trust civilian, democratic institutions,'' said
Lourdes Flores Nano, an opposition congresswoman. ``The polls say
he can't win, but if the group at the head of the army insists on
Fujimori the possibility of fraud is very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori denied that he had manipulated the system and said
Congress was doing its democratic duty. ``I think we have a very
open, democratic system, even with its imperfections,'' he said.
``Before Peru had a democracy, but one that didn't function in the
face of terrorism and narcoterrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   He underscored how much Peru has changed on his trip to
Corpacancha. He would not have dared come to this Andean village 85
miles northeast of Lima without an army battalion when he first
took office in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, young Shining Path terrorists played soccer with
the skulls of their victims in these Andean highlands. As part of
their effort to terrorize the peasantry into submission, they
rounded up local leaders in village squares and then ordered their
relatives to stone them to death at gunpoint. The army was in
retreat until the security forces arrested the top terrorist
leaders in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But this Sunday, Fujimori dropped by this settlement in a
helicopter with only a light escort of bodyguards to enjoy a
mountainside picnic, pass out gifts and dole out promises of new
roads, tourism projects and credits to expand their llama, alpaca
and sheep production.
</P>
<P>
   As the peasants swelled around him, tussling him as they
received their gifts, he cried out: ``Order! Order! This country
needs order, no?''
</P>
<P>
   The peasants dutifully obeyed, like recruits following a drill
sergeant, as the chaos gave way to three neat lines.
</P>
<P>
   In appreciation for the presidential gifts, the peasants gave
Fujimori a sheep with the Peruvian flag tied around its neck and a
hunk of barbecued alpaca to go with the French wine and Polish
vodka he brought along on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Fujimori assembled the reporters traveling with him, and
via satellite telephone, gave a nationally broadcast news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government gets results,'' Fujimori told his people.

BUDGET PLAN TO MAKE BUSH'S TAX CUTS HARDER TO ACHIEVE, LAWMAKER
SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush's tax-relief promises will
be hard to fulfill, a key lawmaker said Wednesday after unveiling a
$91 billion state spending plan that boosts appropriations for
schools and public safety but leaves less money for tax cuts than
Bush desired.
</P>
<P>
   Without touching Texas' initial tobacco-settlement paycheck of
$1.7 billion, and without allocating the $2.5 billion in left-over
revenues from the 1998-99 spending cycle, the 2000-01 budget would
continue most services at current levels yet boost funding for
schools, public safety and human services by $3.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed budget is 3.8 percent bigger than that of the
current biennium, which ends Aug. 31. At $91 billion, it's
equivalent to the annual spending of some nations _ such as
Australia and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the current spending cycle, which will end with a
rare surplus, the new Texas proposal would increase spending on
education by $2.5 billion; add $428 million for public safety, and
$465 million for health and human services.
</P>
<P>
   Those big-ticket items are among Bush's spending priorities, but
he also campaigned for re-election with a pledge to push for $2.7
billion in sales and franchise tax reductions. Although Bush has
adjusted his outlook in recent weeks as new revenue projections
were released, he has remained hopeful that some degree of relief
was achievable
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Finance Committee Chairman Bill Ratliff, R-Mt.
Pleasant, renewed his own cautionary stance that there won't be
enough ``discretionary'' money to meet Bush's goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be difficult,'' Ratliff said. He explained that the
estimated $2.5 billion in discretionary money would have to cover
any tax cuts; new initiatives for public schools and universities;
and a proposed enhancement of Child Protective Services, along with
any other ``wish-list'' items that lawmakers present.
</P>
<P>
   House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rob Junell, D-San
Angelo, who filed the plan as House Bill 1 on Wednesday, joined his
Senate counterpart in urging members to carefully weigh the
spending options. He said the House could present its final plan to
the Senate by late March.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not enough money to do everything that every
politician has promised they would do to the extent they
promised,'' Junell said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in addition to the increases for education and public
safety, there could be significantly greater expenditures for debt
service; teacher and other state-employee benefits; and capital
expenses. And many existing programs could get more money based on
increasing population projections and changes in federal mandates.
</P>
<P>
   But, Junell said, ``we didn't take it upon ourself to start new
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't make any effort to try to address the spending of
any ... discretionary, new revenue,'' said Ratliff, who emphasized
that the top priority is to improve schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It properly reflects our priorities ... that 85 percent of the
$3.3 billion (new revenue) has to do with either public or higher
education,'' Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the bigger budget increases:
</P>
<P>
   _ Public schools would gain $1.6 billion to fully fund the
Foundation School Program, which is the state's primary education
fund, buy textbooks, raise the guaranteed yield and fund facilities
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   _ About $428 million for health and human services would cover
increased state Medicaid costs; help needy nursing-home clients and
compensate for rising caseloads in foster care and adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Teacher Retirement System would see $296 million to
address rising retirement costs and health insurance premiums. An
additional $76 million was set aside for a 2001 projected deficit
for the TRS-Care system of health care for retired teachers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Higher education would collect $233 million to accommodate
enrollment growth in junior colleges and health-related
institutions, and to help with debt service and insurance costs.
</P>
<P>
   _ The mammoth criminal justice system would get a $229 million
increase to improve supervision of adults and juveniles. About $148
million of the sum would be targeted to accommodate prison
population growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is simply to maintain current levels of programs,''
Ratliff said. ``If you add those up, that's virtually $3 billion of
the $3.3 billion (new revenue,) which is 90 percent of the
increase,'' Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco proceeds, part of a $17-billion settlement pact
reached last year, were earmarked months ago for various state
institutions, health and anti-smoking programs, but they must be
formally appropriated by lawmakers before distribution.
</P>
<P>
   If left unchanged by the Legislature, the distribution would
include $400 million for higher education; $200 million for a
smoking reduction pilot program; $100 million for the University of
Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center Endowment; and $25 million each
for the UT Medical Branch at Galveston Endowment and the UT Health
Science Center at Houston Endowment.
</P>
<P>
   Interest income from the various endowments would be available
to operate programs, but Ratliff and Junell said the endowments
should be off-limits to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Legislature, in its wisdom, should choose to spend that
tobacco money as opposed to putting it into endowments and
permanent funds for the future, then I suppose you could lump it in
as discretionary (money). We are going to strongly encourage the
Legislature not to do that,'' Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that it would be hard, in two years, to wean
agencies off higher funding levels if they got a huge infusion of
tobacco money.
</P>
<P>
   Junell cautioned that because the settlements recouped Medicaid
costs, about 40 percent of it might have to be returned to the
federal government.

JACKSON HOPES TO EXPAND PROJECT ON MINORITIES AND BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Senior executives from several dozen blue-chip
corporations will gather here Thursday with hundreds of their
counterparts at minority-owned companies for the second annual
economic conference organized by the Rev. Jesse Jackson's advocacy
initiative, the Wall Street Project.
</P>
<P>
   Like last year's event, the two-day conference has a
high-kilowatt guest list that includes AT&AMP;T chairman C. Michael
Armstrong, Citigroup co-chief executive Sanford Weill _ and, by the
way, President Clinton, three Cabinet members and other officials.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Jackson will use the occasion to exhort Corporate
America to expand its ``trade relationships'' with the ``emerging
markets'' in inner cities and rural backwaters, through employment,
capital investment and the purchase of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Jackson will also be trying to demonstrate
persuasively that the Wall Street Project is operating with a
broader mandate and a clearer focus than it demonstrated at its
debut conference last year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its name, the project is aimed at expanding
opportunities for women and minorities all across Corporate
America, not just on Wall Street. ``The term `Wall Street' is
simply symbolic of the entire finance and business culture,''
Jackson said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   When he met with local groups over the last year, he said, he
frequently asked them to name five top political leaders, and
``they all could.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I asked them to name five top corporate CEOs, and there
was dead silence,'' he continued. ``We've got to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Project still has much of the fervor and facets
of a grass-roots political organization. It relies heavily on its
founder's charisma, prominence and access to top executives. And
while Jackson says he prefers private negotiations, in the last
year he has also led marches, visited picket lines and attended
rallies _ proving that the fledgling project is, at the very least,
a bully pulpit for the economic agenda that he has promoted through
his Rainbow/PUSH Coalition for many years.
</P>
<P>
   And, like the grass-roots civil rights movement that first
brought Jackson to prominence as a top aide to the Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr., the Wall Street project is emerging as a
first-class networking arena for minority business leaders,
introducing them not only to mainstream executives like Weill at
Citigroup but also to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Emma Chappell, the founder and chairman of the United Bank of
Philadelphia, cites her encounter with Vernon Duckrey, who owns
more than 100 Burger King and Pizza Hut franchises in southern New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Both are black entrepreneurs, and they have built their
businesses a short distance away from each other. ``But I had no
idea he existed until the Wall Street Project referred him to me,''
Ms. Chappell said. ``Now we are getting ready to finance some of
his new construction, and I've got a good new customer.''
</P>
<P>
   A new element added to the project's grass-roots format, Jackson
said, is shareholder activism. The project has purchased stock in
107 American corporations, and it intends to be an active
shareholder. Jackson has attended annual meetings to urge
corporations to resolve existing disputes with minority employees
and to expand the business they do with minority-owned suppliers,
professionals and banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has always been part of Jesse Jackson's broader
rhetorical agenda, but now they're putting it into action,'' said
Timothy Smith, the director of the Interfaith Center on Corporate
Responsibility in New York. ``I don't think any company could
ignore him. He can jawbone or encourage or praise _ and he also has
the ability to launch a major campaign against you if you don't
respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Project already claims some successes. Several
companies have added minority directors to their boards at the
group's urging, and others, like Boeing Co., have begun to resolve
longstanding employee disputes after Jackson intervened.
</P>
<P>
   The project also persuaded General Motors Corp. to undertake a
year-long independent review of its minority dealer development
program. That review resulted in a blueprint to improve the
program, which is now being implemented. The project also
encouraged MCI Worldcom Inc. and six other companies to include
minority-owned banks in their securities sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Jackson's effort has emboldened some minority business
leaders to promote his agenda. In one example, analysts from Ariel
Capital Management, a black-controlled mutual fund and
money-management company in Chicago, now routinely ask executives
about the diversity of their boards and senior management, said
Ariel president John Rogers. ``The Wall Street Project has made it
easier to ask the question,'' he added. ``And it is a great way to
see whether top management at a corporation gets it.''
</P>
<P>
   The project's leaders have lobbied for improvements in Federal
Communications Commission rules about minority ownership of media
outlets and Small Business Administration programs aimed at
financing less affluent entrepreneurs. And it has pushed for new
public-private programs to steer capital to the inner cities and
Appalachia.
</P>
<P>
   But in a departure from both traditional shareholder activism
and grass-roots political work, the Wall Street project has as much
to say to its supporters as it does to its adversaries. And its
message, Jackson says, is that ``casting a ballot to vote is not
enough.``
</P>
<P>
   `` We have to cast our proxy, too,'' he said. ``We have to
exercise our power as investors.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 corporations are helping to sponsor this year's
conference events, up from barely a dozen last year. And while last
year's sponsors were largely from the financial-services industry,
this year's sponsors include Boeing, the Frito-Lay subsidiary of
Pepsico, Xerox Corp. and the Stop and Shop supermarket unit of
Royal Ahold NV.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Project is a program of the Citizenship
Education Fund, an Ohio-chartered charitable foundation that
Jackson formed 15 years ago. The fund has supported the project
during its embryonic stages and monitors its finances, said Janice
Mathis, an officer of the fund and general counsel of the
Rainbow/PUSH Coalition in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the project's 1998 revenues consisted of the
approximately $400,000 raised at last year's conference, Ms. Mathis
said, and its 1999 budget relies heavily on Thursday's benefit, at
which poet Maya Angelou and Clinton will be the guests of honor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The project's main office is in New York. Each of its new
regional outposts _ in Chicago, Detroit and Los Angeles _ is
expected to be self-sustaining through local fund-raising, Ms.
Mathis said. These offices, in most cases, are built around ``trade
bureaus,'' the local minority business clubs that have been run for
years by the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. Trade bureau members
contribute a minimum of $250 to join; their dues now entitle them
to receive the Wall Street Project's monthly newsletter, which says
it has 3,500 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Project will be constantly tempted to expand
beyond its shoestring budget simply because the needs are so great,
said Chee Chee Williams, who directs the New York office. And
Jackson has often been criticized for spreading himself too thin
and not following through on his ambitious agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But his supporters do not seem worried. ``I don't think we
should expect him to do the follow-through,'' said Ms. Chappell,
the Philadelphia banker. ``It is up to all of us to do that.''

CELTICS OWNER OFFERS TO BUY BACK STOCK

<P>
   Boston Celtics owner Paul Gaston offered to increase his stake
in the team's ownership Wednesday, driving stock in the limited
partnership to a 52-week high of 17 1/2, before it settled back to
close at 16 1/2, up 2 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Gaston's closely held Castle Creek Partners LP is offering to
buy up as many as 430,000 shares of the publicly held Boston
Celtics LP in a cash tender offer set to expire March 1. The offer
for the units, about 16 percent of those outstanding, is $17 per
unit.
</P>
<P>
   The offer spurred a high level of trading in the team's shares,
with 60,400 units traded. The three-month daily average has been
16,400.
</P>
<P>
   Castle Creek, which is privately owned and controlled almost
entirely by Gaston and his family, currently owns 120,000 shares of
the publicly traded portion of the Celtics ownership. If the tender
offer is realized in full, Castle Creek would own 24 percent of the
publicly traded stock.
</P>
<P>
   Castle Creek owns about 52 percent of the Boston Celtics, with
the publicly traded shares of the Boston Celtics LP controls about
48 percent of the NBA franchise _ the only publicly traded
ownership in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Gaston's move signals his expectation that the stock will
increase in value, despite the National Basketball Association's
recent labor strife and the retirement Wednesday of the league's
star attraction, Michael Jordan, team officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, the Gaston family believes in this entity,
and consolidating their ownership of the entity is always important
to them,'' said Richard Pond, executive vice president, chief
operating officer and chief financial officer of the Boston Celtics
LP.
</P>
<P>
   Pond said the team also is interested in cutting the high cost
of serving some 80,000 unit holders. Because many people have
bought shares as souvenirs more than investments, most investors
hold less than 100 shares. The administrative costs related to
serving them is high, Pond said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assumption is that by consolidating about 20 percent of
the stock, we'll reduce the number of shareholders,'' Pond said.
</P>
<P>
   The tender offer has nothing to do with either the six-month
lockout of NBA players, the most disruptive labor dispute in the
history of the league that was finally settled last week, Pond
asserted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that this was planned before that was done,''
he said. ``If we made this decision before it was done, it would
have looked like we were doing something based on information we
had that the public did not have.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock in the Boston Celtics LP has increased by about 60 percent
since the end of the lockout. It jumped 4 1/8 to 14 5/8 on day the
players and owners struck an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-week low was 7 5/16 on October 14, while the negotiations
were underway for two months and showing little hope of yielding an
agreement.

HONG KONG STOCK MARKET TUMBLES AMID CHINA DEBT JITTERS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Fears of a debt crisis in China swept through Hong
Kong on Wednesday, punishing the stock market and stirring fresh
anxiety in a city that seemed to be recovering from Asia's economic
distress.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index fell 437.79 points, or
more than 4 percent, to 10,273.77. The indexes here of
China-related stocks was hit even harder _ plunging 12 percent as
investors abandoned Hong Kong-listed companies with ties to Beijing
or to China's provincial governments.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first big reversal of Hong Kong's market since stocks
began rallying last September on hopes that the Asian crisis was
abating. ``People are freaking out because China stocks are
basically the only way Hong Kong made money in the last year,''
said Simon Ogus, director of Asian economics at Warburg Dillon Read
here. ``This is a reality shock for Hong Kong, just to show them
how difficult life is going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The fears about China began on Sunday, when the government in
Beijing refused to bail out foreign creditors of its second-largest
investment trust company. China said it would place the debt-ridden
Guangdong International Trust &AMP; Investment Corp., or Gitic, in
bankruptcy, and the foreign creditors would have to take their
places in line to try to recover their loans.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Chinese officials told foreign creditors of another
troubled state company, Guangdong Enterprises Holdings, that it had
debts of $2.9 billion. That figure was larger than expected and
prompted skittish investors to ask whether other China-related
companies had huge, hidden debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more things that come out about Chinese companies, the
more people want to run,'' said an executive at an international
bank with loans outstanding to Gitic.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials have warned that several more investment trust
companies may follow Gitic into insolvency. Some investors fear
that the financial crisis may spread to mainland Chinese companies
that are publicly listed on the Hong Kong market. These ``red
chips'' were once the equivalent of Wednesday's Internet stocks _
soaring to gravity-defying heights before the onset of Asian crisis
in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a report by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. estimates that the red
chips may have an aggregate debt exceeding $12 billion. Standard &AMP;
Poor's and other agencies have cut their ratings on the debt of
Guangdong Enterprises and other red chips as their balance sheets
have become precarious.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the debt trouble, many analysts reiterated that the
problems at two companies in Guangdong did not foretell a broader
crisis in the Chinese economy or banking system. Nor, they add, did
it mean that foreign banks would suddenly stop lending to Chinese
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may make it tougher for spiffy, coastal Chinese outfits
to get loans,'' Ogus said. ``But as far as Beijing is concerned,
it's not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   As investors digest the news from China, they are finding that
not all companies are the same in the eyes of Beijing. Gitic and
Guangdong Enterprises are both ultimately owned by the Guangdong
province government and have the same purpose: to raise capital for
the authorities there.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while Beijing peremptorily shut down and liquidated Gitic
and infuriated the company's creditors, it has gone to pains to
assure creditors of Guangdong Enterprises that it will keep the
company afloat by injecting cash and assets. The government also
retained Goldman, Sachs to devise a plan to clean up the company's
finances, install new managers and sharpen its focus.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the different approaches might have to do with the
different authorities involved: As a financial company, Gitic is
regulated by China's central bank. As a diversified conglomerate,
Guangdong Enterprises is controlled by officials in the provincial
capital, Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
   But the difference may also have to do with jurisdiction:
Guangdong Enterprises is listed in Hong Kong, where creditors have
rights, while Gitic is based in Guangzhou, where bankruptcy law is
untested and where foreign banks have made loans based on winks and
nods from Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Guangdong Enterprises owns some valuable assets, while
Gitic is a more speculative venture. Chinese Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji plans to phase out investment trusts as part of an overhaul
of the nation's financial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``In large part, this is a public relations matter on the part
of the Chinese government,'' said T.K. Chang, a partner in the Hong
Kong office of the law firm Coudert Brothers, which is representing
South Korean creditors of Gitic.
</P>
<P>
   Chang is among many lawyers here who are taking refresher
courses on Chinese bankruptcy law to monitor the Gitic proceeding.
He said he expected the process to last about six months. But he
expressed worries that if the bankruptcy court liquidated Gitic's
assets, particularly its real estate, too quickly, it might end up
holding a fire sale that would shrink the return for creditors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bankruptcy will give quite an indication of how China
plans to handle these issues in the future,'' Chang said.

BAY STATE MOVES TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM TOBACCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS AND HILARY SARGENT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In what anti-smoking leaders say is a groundbreaking
move that will serve as a national model, Attorney General Scott
Harshbarger Wednesday issued a set of tough marketing and
advertising regulations aimed at curbing the tobacco industry's
targeting of children.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger said his new rules, which are slated to take effect
August 1, will stop much of the industry's use of advertising and
sale strategies that are aimed at hooking young smokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to end the deceptive tactics used to market, sell and
distribute tobacco products to our children, and do whatever we
reasonably can do to stop illegal access to tobacco by minors,''
Harshbarger said.
</P>
<P>
   But the 11 regulations that the attorney general issued under
the state's consumer protection statute must withstand a likely
legal challenge from the tobacco industry before they can take
effect. Harshbarger's move -- any outcome from a court challenge --
will provide a litmus test nationally as to whether consumer
protection statutes can be used in the battle against smoking.
</P>
<P>
   An industry spokesman, Scott Williams, Wednesday sharply
criticized Harshbarger, accusing him of ``grandstanding.'' He said
the recent national settlement that the attorney general signed
already placed restrictions for deceptive marketing to teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harshbarger has tried to make a career of beating up on the
tobacco industry... and this is more public posturing by a
politician who prefers rhetoric over results,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the industry would study the regulations before
making a decision whether to challenge them with a court case.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Harshbarger's move, which began almost a year ago when he
announced he would hold a series of hearings on his proposed
regulations, has once again put him on the cutting edge of tobacco
control issues.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-smoking leaders Wednesday said his use of the state's
consumer protection statute that allows him to promulgate such
regulations will pave the way for other attorneys general to follow
his lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very comprehensive,'' said Edward L. Sweda, Jr.,
senior attorney with the Tobacco Control Resource Center at
Northeastern University School of Law. ``Other attorneys general
across the country can look at these as a model.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by his office, Harshbarger, who is
leaving office next week after a failed bid for governor last fall,
said the rules will deal a major blow to what he said is the
industry's attempt to addict young people to nicotine and thus
assure a future market.
</P>
<P>
   ``These landmark rules will be one more step toward denying Big
Tobacco new customers in Massachusetts,'' said Harshbarger. ``When
the 1999 school year starts, our children will no longer be
bombarded with highly visible enticements that are designed to make
tobacco products seem attractive and cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the regulations will regulate sales and ban tobacco
billboards and store ads at retail outlets near schools. They will
ban outward-facing tobacco ads in retail establishments within
1,000 feet of the state's elementary and middle schools, parks and
playgrounds. Stores selling tobacco products within this 1,000 foot
parameter will be restricted to displaying one black and white
sign, no larger than 576 square inches that states ``Tobacco
products sold here.''
</P>
<P>
   Other restrictions include requiring warning labels on cigars
packs; locks on cigarette vending machines; bans on the
distribution of unpackaged or repackaged cigarettes; prohibit
advertising tobacco products in enclosed stadiums; and outlaw
mail-order distribution of tobacco products without age
verification.

A VISIONARY'S DREAM FULFILLED, NOW AS MEMORIAL  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 17)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Give a determined evolution a little time, and it can look like
a revolution. ``She completely transformed the institution,'' the
once revolutionary composer and conductor Pierre Boulez said last
week of Judith Arron, who was no one's idea of a revolutionary, and
her achievement at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   True, change was already in the wind when Ms. Arron arrived as
general manager and artistic director in 1986. Her first major task
was to oversee the renovation of the hall and related construction,
which had been initiated long before.
</P>
<P>
   But she became executive director in 1988 and played a more
central role in planning for the hall's extensive centenary
celebration in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Now a dream of her own has come to fruition with the recent
announcement of plans for a small but versatile third performance
stage in the historic Carnegie building, replacing a movie theater
under the main auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Arron died last month, at 56, after a long battle with
cancer, and the announcement brought added news: although the new
hall will be named for Arthur and Judy Zankel, its prime donors,
the performance space itself will be called the Judith Arron
Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Carnegie Hall will present a memorial service for
Ms. Arron on Tuesday afternoon. Although fiercely partisan on
behalf of Carnegie and a tough competitor in booking artists, she
was widely loved in the world of music for her personal warmth as
well as her thorough professionalism, and those expected to speak
in tribute to her include the violinist Isaac Stern, who is the
president of Carnegie Hall, and Sanford I. Weill, the chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arron also conceived a wide-ranging series of events related
to the millennium, some of them just announced. But whatever
transformation she worked at the hall may best be symbolized not so
much by the big public events surrounding renovation, construction
or landmark celebrations as by her novel artistic ventures,
especially a series of professional training workshops, operating
largely out of public view.
</P>
<P>
   The prototype was the Robert Shaw Choral Workshop, developed in
1990 by a conductor with vast experience in training choral singers
and conductors. The current edition of that annual series _ alas,
without Shaw, who is ailing _ culminates in a concert Sunday
afternoon, with works of Verdi, Szymanowski and Poulenc conducted
by Charles Dutoit.
</P>
<P>
   Other workshops have been developed by Stern (chamber music),
Boulez (contemporary music and orchestral conducting), Georg Solti
(orchestral performance), Marilyn Horne (vocal performance),
Luciano Berio (composition), Jorma Panula (orchestral conducting),
Alfred Brendel (piano performance of Beethoven) and, for next
season, Daniel Barenboim (orchestral conducting and piano
performance).
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Arron had done nothing more than enlist some of the
world's finest musicians and let them work their will, she might
have done well enough. But to hear Boulez tell it, she did much
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had real artistic vision,'' he said. ``She had the ideas.
Instead of saying, `What can you do for us?,' she said, `Here's
what I have in mind,' and I appreciated that very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arron elaborated on the workshop idea in a series of
``Perspectives,'' broader collaborations with artists, beginning
this season with the conductor Dennis Russell Davies and Brendel,
and continuing next season with Barenboim, Boulez and the pianist
Maurizio Pollini. She set up a composer's chair, which Ellen Taaffe
Zwilich, the current occupant, cedes next season to Boulez. Ms.
Arron expanded the hall's educational activities and, in 1992,
installed the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band.
</P>
<P>
   Together, these multifarious initiatives represented a shift in
the balance from merely renting out the hall toward carving out a
genuinely creative role in the presentation and packaging of
concerts and related events. That shift was even more pronounced in
the smaller Weill Recital Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Some such activities had taken place before, of course, and Ms.
Arron's best efforts did not entirely eliminate humdrum events even
from Carnegie's own presentations. Yet her programming showed a
fresh imagination and a serious effort to create meaningful themes
and connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had an idea behind it, a continuing idea that Carnegie Hall
had never had before,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who hired her may, in fact, have got more than they
bargained for. Before going to Carnegie Hall in 1986, Ms. Arron was
the manager of the Cincinnati Symphony and Cincinnati May Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``She learned faster than anyone could have believed,'' Stern
said. ``She came to the big city from a small town and learned
incessantly on the job. She developed a personal connection with
the world's artists and with the big backers in this city, and she
established an atmosphere of collegiality that I, as a professional
traveler, have never seen in any other hall.''
</P>
<P>
   What especially struck one critic, whose dealings with Ms. Arron
were limited, was her unfailing grace in the face of adversity.
Only those who were close to her had any idea what she was going
through physically or personally.
</P>
<P>
   Professionally, she faced an interesting little test in 1995,
when a layer of concrete was found under the renovated stage floor
despite Carnegie's heated denials over a decade that any such thing
existed. Ms. Arron handled the matter deftly, overseeing removal of
the concrete in the summer and, in the fall, immediately inviting
representatives of the music press to her office to reveal and
explain the incident candidly.
</P>
<P>
   For this writer, Ms. Arron defined the word ``aplomb.'' And
that, to judge from many who knew her better, may have been the
least of it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ Pender High School coach Ron Coley often got
a funny feeling while watching Michael Jordan play with the Chicago
Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   When he looked at the man who was, many believe, the best
basketball player of all time, he would still see the wiry kid he
coached as an assistant coach at Laney High School.
</P>
<P>
   It's strange, Coley said to have such close contact with
immortality. But in many ways, Coley still saw in Jordan that kid
he knew at Laney.
</P>
<P>
   A kid with an unparalleled work ethic who wanted to get better -
and did. A kid who loved basketball.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to think he's walking away from the game and retiring
for good this time, Coley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our loss, the fans,'' he said. ``I'm really surprised
because Michael really loved to play. I'm surprised he'd do it
because of that love.''
</P>
<P>
   Coley could see Jordan budding into a star even in his high
school days. Jordan set the school record for points scored in one
game with 44, and he led the team to a 19-4 record his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   His high school career ended on a sour note. Jordan fouled out
trying to help Laney defeat New Hanover in his last high school
game, which they lost 56-52. But Jordan's career soon surpassed
anything Coley could have ever dreamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd thought he'd be an excellent NBA guard, but not an icon,''
Coley said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan keeps in touch with his old coaches, Coley said. He wrote
a letter of recommendation for Coley when he was being considered
for the Pender job four years ago. ``He joked about Pender being
the enemy,'' Coley said.
</P>
<P>
   When Coley got the job, Jordan donated shoes to the team, and
has every year since.
</P>
<P>
   Laney head coach Fred Lynch, an assistant at Laney, gets shoes
and sweats for the basketball team every year, a deal the school
has benefited from since Jordan signed an endorsement contract with
Nike in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The gym at Laney now bears Jordan's name.
</P>
<P>
   Like Coley, Lynch keeps in touch with Jordan from time to time.
He said Jordan's achievements have given the school a constant
source of pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the people at the school, they're proud to have a person
like him to be associated with the school,'' Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   Coley says we haven't seen the last of Michael Jordan on the
basketball court. Basketball will never cease to be part of
Jordan's life, Coley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be at Chapel Hill playing pickup because he loves the
game,'' Coley said.

   NEW YORK _ The slightly distant self-consciousness that can
envelop Cassandra Wilson in a concert hall was gone when she
performed at the Blue Note on Tuesday, her first nightclub
appearance in New York in four years. Instead, Ms. Wilson was
almost giddy, and in a confident cabaret-style performance with a
six-piece band, she nailed every step.
</P>
<P>
   It was an encouraging return: 13 months ago she presented a run
of concerts at Alice Tully Hall that dabbled with the idea of Miles
Davis as performer, composer and embodiment of a dark, elemental
tenderness. It was ambitious but chaotic, and she didn't quite make
her case.
</P>
<P>
   Since then she has finished a Miles Davis-themed record to be
released in March, done some touring, and tightened the concept for
each song in her repertory to the point where they're stylized and
shining. She included some of her older songs in the set, but the
Miles Davis songs easily stood out; they've come a great distance.
</P>
<P>
   She and her musical director, the bassist Lonnie Plaxico, don't
set out to replicate works from Davis' canon at all; there aren't
even any horns in the band. They take only the principal melody
within a piece of Davis' music, and create the rest on their own.
They're looking to suggest the spell he could cast with his
inward-gazing economy of notes. The group plays textural music,
with two guitars strumming flamenco chords and picking out ambient
effects that shimmer in pockets of silence. The show is inscribed
with all kinds of jazz connotations, but in the end it's elegant,
dreamy pop.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Never Broken,'' she sang the seesawing line of ``ESP,''
written by Wayne Shorter for the mid-'60s Davis band, stretching it
out over a slinky vamp. Davis' ``Seven Steps to Heaven,'' for which
Ms. Wilson has written lyrics, began with the rhythm played in
snare-drum rolls. After a few choruses the drummer Marcus Baylor
switched to swinging on the ride cymbal while Ms. Wilson plunged
into scat singing, delivering long, smoky tones.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilson practiced some Betty Carter-style on-the-spot band
control: she dragged out a vowel sound and looked at her pianist,
Jason Moran, who knew to extend the trill he was playing until she
let go of the word. In one of the evening's few solos Moran gave
the music a thrilling edge, staying deep in the rhythm and punching
dark chords in thorny bursts. Shortly thereafter Ms. Wilson cut off
the song, quickening the senses of those who had been lulled by its
groove.

SHERIFF JOE WINS, EVEN WHEN HE LOSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Sheriff Joe Arpaio is cheerful. He's relaxed. I'm
asking him about an $8.25 million settlement that Maricopa County
will pay the family of a man killed in his jail, and yet Joe's
happy. As he should be.
</P>
<P>
   He won.
</P>
<P>
   On May 31, 1996, police hauled 33-year-old Scott Norberg into
the Madison Street Jail. Within a few hours, Norberg suffered a
horrifying death at the hands of Joe's guards.
</P>
<P>
   All his family gets for this is money.
</P>
<P>
   No apology. No admission of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   The people responsible for Norberg's death haven't lost their
jobs and neither has their boss.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which was announced last week, will be paid by
insurance companies. Nowhere in it does the sheriff's department
accept blame for what happened to Norberg.
</P>
<P>
   For the cuts and bruises on his body. For the 21 pairs of
stun-gun burns. For the final, frantic moments of a man strapped to
a chair, his mouth and neck wrapped in a towel, gasping for air.
</P>
<P>
   After the settlement was worked out, Arpaio issued a statement
that read in part, ``I am relieved that this tentative agreement
contains no admissions of fault or liability on behalf of our
officers. . . Nor does the agreement require any changes in jail
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   He should be pleased.
</P>
<P>
   He gets to give away someone else's money and keep his own
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   When first asked about the Norberg deal, Arpaio says he can't
comment because it hasn't been finalized. Then he talks anyway.
</P>
<P>
   He always does.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Norberg's family) said it was never about money. So why
do they agree to settle?'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Then, softening his tone and his language, he adds, ``I don't
want to make derogatory statments against the family. I feel for
them, in a way. But, I know my officers tried to do the right
thing. I can't try this case in the media, but I still have to
protect my organization. As you know, throughout this whole ordeal,
I did support my officers. And I will, unless somebody comes up
with new information. And there isn't any.''
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio is asked if he would have accepted a deal in which the
Norbergs received no money, but his office admitted wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never. Never,'' he says. ``I would want to go to a jury. I
would want to go to a court of law where we could bring out the
true facts, not the hype in the media that you've been hearing.
That would be the opportunity to put our case before a judge and
jury and let them decide. So, no, I would never have agreed to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He can say that, now.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have to discuss the fact that Norberg hadn't been
convicted of any crime. He doesn't have to prove Norberg was as
confrontational as his officers claim. He doesn't have to explain
missing evidence.
</P>
<P>
   A trial would have forced his office to do all those things.
</P>
<P>
   But Norberg's father says his family couldn't bear the stress of
pursuing the lawsuit anymore. Scott Norberg has two sons. Their
family didn't want them to endure a trial. They knew would have
been ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of things we know about their son that would
have come out in that trial,'' Arpaio says. `` But I still feel
sorry for the mother and father.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an ongoing criminal investigation into Norberg's death.
Some officers may yet be charged. As for the big cash settlement,
though, the sheriff says, ``I have no control over this money. The
insurance company made that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he believes paying a settlement is not the same as
admitting guilt. And he's right.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things happen,'' he says. ``It's unfortunate. But it's
amazing what my officers have done with the lack of personnel and
the overcrowding. I'd have to say we have the best jail system in
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how it is if the deal stands.
</P>
<P>
   The Norbergs make $8.25 million. Arpaio makes a killing. &QL;

MOTHER OF SHOOTING SUSPECT DESCRIBES SON'S TORMENTED YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The young man accused of killing an Oakland
police officer may be a sad legacy of the tragedy of Jonestown,
said his mother and a psychiatrist who worked with Peoples Temple
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita Bogue, a Jonestown survivor and the mother of Chad
Rhodes, the man accused of killing Officer James Williams Jr., is
afraid her son will be executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything around his life has been trauma,'' Bogue said
Tuesday as she prepared to attend her son's arraignment. ``I'm the
only one who can help him and I can't help myself. He may go to the
electric chair and not even know who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes, 19, is accused of climbing out of a car on an overpass
above Interstate 580 early Sunday and shooting the officer with an
AK-47 assault rifle. He is charged with murder and three counts of
attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the living room of a friend's home Tuesday, Bogue,
42, appeared emotionally fragile as she described her son as a
teen-ager haunted by never knowing who his father was.
</P>
<P>
   Bogue suffers from bouts of amnesia _ the result, said a
psychiatrist, of the psychological trauma caused by her experiences
with the Peoples Temple and the mass suicide 20 years ago in
Jonestown, Guyana.
</P>
<P>
   Hardat Sukhdeo, a Guyana-born retired psychiatrist who treated
Bogue and other Jonestown survivors, said: ``I look at this whole
effect of Jonestown and the suicides and this boy, this little man,
is one of the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonestown was to have been a Utopian dream, free of racism, a
haven for justice.
</P>
<P>
   But on Nov. 18, 1978, the Rev. Jim Jones led his flock from the
San Francisco area into the worst mass murder/suicide in modern
history. More than 900 people, most of them children or elderly,
drank or were forced to drink cyanide-spiked fruit punch.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes was given the last name of a man who claimed he conceived
the child with Bogue in Guyana, but years later turned out to not
be his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left Guyana ... at the time I was pregnant with Chad,''
Bogue recalled. ``I didn't know I was pregnant. I was suffering
from amnesia or something like that. When I was five or six months
pregnant I couldn't remember who my son's father was.''
</P>
<P>
   After her son was born, Bogue said, another Jonestown survivor,
Odell Rhodes, stepped forward to claim paternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not knowing any difference, I put him on the birth
certificate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bogue said Odell Rhodes saw Chad only a couple of times
before he was a year old, and not again until he was 5.
</P>
<P>
   And when he returned, he sought and won custody of Chad.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes back into our lives again and gets custody of my son
because of my disability, my amnesia,'' Bogue said. ``The judge
gives Chad to a man he's seen once or twice before he's 5 years old
and he gets a restraining order against me.''
</P>
<P>
   A court battle that lasted several months resulted in her
regaining custody of her son. Odell Rhodes disappeared for several
years but returned again attempting to regain custody.
</P>
<P>
   Chad was about 10 when he learned from his mother that Odell
Rhodes wasn't his real father.
</P>
<P>
   Bogue said Odell Rhodes' last attempt to gain custody of her son
was about four years ago. But his attempt was stymied when a judge
ordered him to take a paternity test.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, according to Bogue, Odell Rhodes admitted he
wasn't Chad's father, but asked to adopt the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, time and distance from the Jonestown tragedy allowed
Bogue to remember things she had blocked out. Among the things she
said she remembered was the name of her son's real father, who died
in Jonestown.
</P>
<P>
   Bogue said her son began drinking recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started drinking heavy the last couple of months,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday, the police said, Rhodes was with several other
people driving over the 38th Avenue overpass when they saw officers
_ with the emergency lights of their cars flashing _ searching
along the shoulder of I-580 for a gun that reportedly had been
thrown by suspects involved in a chase minutes earlier.
</P>
<P>
   As Williams, two other officers and an evidence technician were
taking pictures of where they found the weapon, six to eight shots
rang out from the overpass, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was hit by a bullet that ripped through his bulletproof
vest. Williams _ a father of three just 11 weeks out of the police
academy _ died Sunday morning at an Oakland hospital.

   After the settlement was worked out, Arpaio issued a statement
that read in part, ``I am relieved that this tentative agreement
contains no admissions of fault or liability on behalf of our
officers. . . Nor does the agreement require any changes in jail
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   He should be pleased.
</P>
<P>
   He gets to give away someone else's money and keep his own
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   When first asked about the Norberg deal, Arpaio says he can't
comment because it hasn't been finalized. Then he talks anyway.
</P>
<P>
   He always does.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Norberg's family) said it was never about money. So why
do they agree to settle?'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Then, softening his tone and his language, he adds, ``I don't
want to make derogatory statments against the family. I feel for
them, in a way. But, I know my officers tried to do the right
thing. I can't try this case in the media, but I still have to
protect my organization. As you know, throughout this whole ordeal,
I did support my officers. And I will, unless somebody comes up
with new information. And there isn't any.''
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio is asked if he would have accepted a deal in which the
Norbergs received no money, but his office admitted wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never. Never,'' he says. ``I would want to go to a jury. I
would want to go to a court of law where we could bring out the
true facts, not the hype in the media that you've been hearing.
That would be the opportunity to put our case before a judge and
jury and let them decide. So, no, I would never have agreed to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He can say that, now.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have to discuss the fact that Norberg hadn't been
convicted of any crime. He doesn't have to prove Norberg was as
confrontational as his officers claim. He doesn't have to explain
missing evidence.
</P>
<P>
   A trial would have forced his office to do all those things.
</P>
<P>
   But Norberg's father says his family couldn't bear the stress of
pursuing the lawsuit anymore. Scott Norberg has two sons. Their
family didn't want them to endure a trial. They knew would have
been ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of things we know about their son that would
have come out in that trial,'' Arpaio says. `` But I still feel
sorry for the mother and father.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an ongoing criminal investigation into Norberg's death.
Some officers may yet be charged. As for the big cash settlement,
though, the sheriff says, ``I have no control over this money. The
insurance company made that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he believes paying a settlement is not the same as
admitting guilt. And he's right.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things happen,'' he says. ``It's unfortunate. But it's
amazing what my officers have done with the lack of personnel and
the overcrowding. I'd have to say we have the best jail system in
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how it is if the deal stands.
</P>
<P>
   The Norbergs make $8.25 million. Arpaio makes a killing. &QL;

TEXAS MAN KILLS 3, SELF IN CHILD SUPPORT CASE, POLICE SAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHARDSON, Texas _ A man who owed $38,000 in overdue child
support shot and killed his ex-wife, her mother and a family friend
early Wednesday, then took his own life.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old son of the ex-wife was in the house at the time
but escaped through an upstairs window when the shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   Police identified the victims as Janette Jeffers, 41; her
mother, Margaret Compton, 67, of Midland; and her friend, Mary
Roland, 63, also of Midland.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was identified as Allen Dale Price, 48, of Gorman,
which is about 140 miles west of this Dallas-area city of 87,000
people. He and Jeffers had been divorced for about 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Michael Hauver said Compton and Roland had been visiting
Jeffers and were preparing to return to Midland when Price arrived
at the house shortly before 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were carrying stuff out to their car when he approached
them and started shooting,'' Hauver said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women was shot in the driveway of the two-story brick
house and the other was found lying in the garage.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffers apparently was inside and called 911 after hearing the
gunshots. She was on the phone with the dispatcher when she was
shot. On a police tape of the call, a woman can be heard screaming,
followed by a shotgun blast. Price then turned the shotgun on
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, Jeffers' son heard the shots and his mother's screams
and climbed through a window onto a second-story balcony and leaped
to the ground, police said. He was standing in the front yard when
officers arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Price and one of the women died at the scene. Two of the women
were taken to hospitals, where they died a short time later.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the quiet cul-de-sac where the Jefferses live were
jolted by the early morning gunfire. Ben Harvey said he heard two
gunshots that sounded like they came from outside the house. ``Then
the house alarm went off and then several other gunshots after
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffers' husband was in California on business, police said, and
her college-age daughter, who is also Price's daughter, was not at
home.
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferses moved to the Dallas suburb from Midland about a
year ago, police said. Hauver said the motive was believed to be an
October order from a Midland judge that required Price to pay
$38,030 in back child support and interest for the couple's
daughter, Jennifer, who attends the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Price was ordered to pay $500 per month starting last November
to clear the debt, but did not do so. He originally was supposed to
have paid $250 per month starting in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Hauver said the 12-year-old told of Price causing ``a history of
some problems like theft of mail and tire-slashing,'' but nothing
recently. The officer added that the boy was a poor source because
his parents tried to shield him from the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Price was stopped by Richardson police Jan. 3 after he ran a red
light. He was driving a rented car and had a 12-gauge pump shotgun
in the back seat. Sgt. Steve Upchurch said a check with the rental
company revealed that the car was overdue and officers were asked
to impound it.
</P>
<P>
   The car had been rented in November, police said, but because of
a paperwork mix-up, the rental company could not confirm that it
had been stolen, so Price was released.
</P>
<P>
   Possession of the shotgun is not illegal, but because Price had
no transportation, it also was impounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't have a guy just walking around the streets with a
shotgun,'' Upchurch said.
</P>
<P>
   Price came to the police station two days later and retrieved
the weapon. It was the same gun used in Wednesday's shooting.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police also believe Price was at the Jeffers home early Tuesday
morning. Jeffers had just left for work when a man entered the
house through the garage.
</P>
<P>
   The man was confronted by Mary Roland, who screamed and ordered
him to leave. She and Compton called police, but the man was gone
when they arrived. Roland could not identify the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had never met Allen Price, so she would not have known if
it was him,'' Hauver said.
</P>

 MONEYBOX: GENERAL MOTORS IS RIDIN' HIGH  
 By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the more curious things about the auto industry is that
the most popular vehicles--sport-utility vehicles and pickups--are
also the most profitable.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean that auto companies make more money on SUVs and
pickups because they sell so many of them, but rather that the
profit margins on what you might call ``non-cars'' are
significantly higher than those on your average Taurus or Accord.
And there's no real sign on the horizon that this is going to
change anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, for instance, announced Friday that its new
full-size pickups should earn profit margins two points greater
than those the company had been making on its older pickups, which
in turn had higher margins than most of GM's cars. In 1999, GM
said, the new pickups could add as much as $400 million to its
bottom line, which is a hefty boost, even for a company as big as
GM.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, of course, the high margins on SUVs and pickups
are not especially paradoxical. If demand is high, automakers
should be able to keep prices up and avoid the discounting that has
eaten into their profits from cars. But in another sense the
non-car market is an anomaly in this consumer's paradise we now
inhabit, in which prices never go up and often go down. (Nothing
makes an advertisement seem more out-of-touch than a reference to
how expensive everything is these days.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the non-car market is an anomaly within the auto
industry itself. That industry essentially constructed itself
around the idea of regular price increases and of consumers' ascent
up the ladder of quality. Today, auto manufacturers have reconciled
themselves to the reality of stable prices and of consumers who
will be happy to drive an Accord for the rest of their lives. The
only real exception to this rule appears to be SUVs and trucks.
(Well, and Ferraris, I guess.)
</P>
<P>
   What's surprising about that exception is that it's lasted as
long as it has. Although SUV mania did reach a crescendo this year,
especially as the price of gasoline continued to tumble, the Big
Three have been selling Navigators and Jeep Cherokees as fast as
they could make them for years now. And these vehicles have been
high-margin all along. Whenever an SUV plant goes on strike, for
instance, you're sure to read about the thousands of dollars that
the company is losing on every vehicle that isn't rolling off the
line.
</P>
<P>
   So why hasn't price competition been the inevitable result of
high demand? If an opportunity for profit exists, competitors
should emerge to fill it. So what's missing?
</P>
<P>
   The simplest answer is also probably the most accurate one,
which is that the Big Three have faced less global competition in
the SUV and truck market than in the market for cars. While the
Camry and Accord have surpassed the Taurus in U.S. sales, and while
U.S. luxury cars are under significant pressure from Lexus,
Infiniti and Mercedes Benz, there are many fewer competitors in the
SUV market, and those that do exist are often recent competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The truck market, meanwhile, is even more dominated by the Big
Three. In part, that's because the market for cars is more global
than the market for pickups (there aren't too many pickups in
Japan). And in part it's because foreign car companies have been
slow to realize both that they have the technical capabilities to
compete in these markets and that these markets are only going to
get bigger.
</P>
<P>
   With the introduction of the new Mercedes and Lexus SUVs and the
recent arrival of the new Honda Odyssey, though, the relative
insulation of the Big Three from price competition should change.
That's more than just a good thing for consumers, too. The
experience of the 1970s and 1980s scarred Detroit, and ensured that
the Big Three wouldn't take U.S. consumers for granted. But
memories, no matter how bad, are no substitute for some real
competition in the present.

THE SPIN: WITNESS THIS, WITNESS THAT 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the weekend, various senators appeared on television to
explain why witnesses should or should not testify at President
Clinton's trial. Not surprisingly, every way in which the
Republicans frame the question leads to calling witnesses, and
every way in which the Democrats frame the question leads to not
calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want to focus attention on the facts of the case,
which are strong. Democrats want to divert attention to the
significance of the case, which is weak. So Republicans want
witnesses, and Democrats don't. Republicans also want to focus
scrutiny on the defendant (Clinton), whereas Democrats want to
shift scrutiny to the prosecution (the GOP). Finally, Democrats
want to underscore the constitutional costs of Clinton's
conviction, while Republicans want to underscore the social costs
of his acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a taxonomy of this week's frames and strategies, taken
from a debate among six senators on NBC's Meet the Press.
</P>
<P>
   1. Sex. This is the simplest Democratic frame. Its purpose is to
keep witnesses out. The argument is that they will talk about sex,
besmirch the Senate, and offend the viewing public. Example: ``I
don't understand why the House feels they have to sully the floor
of the United States Senate'' (Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.).
</P>
<P>
   2. Rule of Law. This is the Republican rebuttal to the ``sex''
frame. Its purposes are 1) to get witnesses into the trial by
arguing that the real subject of testimony is perjury and
obstruction, not sex; and 2) to shift the burden to Clinton's
defenders by warning that his acquittal would send the country a
corrosive message. Example: ``You can certainly argue ... that
someone who breaks the law in not upholding and not telling the
truth under oath and someone who obstructs justice does, in fact,
threaten the republic'' (Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa.).
</P>
<P>
   3. Summary Judgment. This is the basic Democratic rebuttal to
the ``rule of law'' frame. Its purposes are to shortcut the trial,
change the subject from the facts of the case to their
insignificance, and shift the burden back to Clinton's accusers.
The argument is that even if all the facts are granted, they don't
``rise to the level'' that would justify his removal. Example:
``We're willing to accept the facts, because the threshold question
is this: Even if it's all true exactly as the House managers have
put it forward, does this rise to the level of impeachment? Does it
rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors? That's the
threshold question'' (Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Censure. This is the advanced rebuttal to the ``rule of law''
frame. Its purpose is to fast-forward past the verdict to the
sentence, with an emphasis on mitigating circumstances. The
argument is that a resolution censuring Clinton is sufficient to
reaffirm the laws against perjury and obstruction of justice.
Example: ``I came to the conclusion that the appropriate punishment
for this kind of wrongdoing, lying about an extramarital
relationship, was censure. ... Part of the rule of law is that the
punishment should fit the crime'' (Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.).
</P>
<P>
   5. Constitutional Duty. This is the Republican response to the
``censure'' frame. Its purpose is to abort the censure movement
before the censure movement aborts the trial. The argument is that
the Constitution authorizes the Senate to vote only on conviction,
not on censure. Example: ``I don't think our business is to tell
the president he has to ... make some magical act of contrition.
... Our job is defined very clearly in the Constitution'' (Sen.
Mike DeWine, R-Ohio).
</P>
<P>
   6. Constitutional Duty II. This Democratic rejoinder turns the
GOP's strict constructionism on its head. The argument is that the
Constitution says the president should be removed only for crimes
that imperil the nation. Example: ``George Mason, I think, put it
succinctly. He said, 'Was this an attempt to subvert the
Constitution?' All of President Clinton's untruths, all of his
lying under oath, if you will, about an extramarital relationship
does not subvert the Constitution'' (Schumer).
</P>
<P>
   7. Jury. This all-purpose Republican frame posits that the
Senate is Clinton's jury and should behave accordingly. This
accomplishes several objectives. First, it makes the strongest case
for calling witnesses. Example: ``I have never seen a trial before
where you had factual disputes where you didn't have witnesses
where you could watch their demeanor on the stand, listen to them,
judge one witness vs. another witness'' (DeWine). Second, it
neutralizes the ``summary judgment'' frame, since summary judgments
are up to the judge, not the jury. Example: ``We have an obligation
to sit back as jurors and let the case be presented'' (Santorum).
Third, it shortcuts the ``summary judgment'' and ``censure'' frames
by organizing the trial's issues in temporal sequence rather than
as a decision tree. Example: ``We're prejudging this thing [when we
say] it doesn't meet the standard of the high crimes and
misdemeanors. That's what the trial's all about. ... We're going to
listen to the evidence'' (Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I.).
</P>
<P>
   8. Jury Nullification. This Democratic rebuttal shatters the
``jury'' frame and diverts scrutiny from the defendant to the
prosecution. The argument is that the Senate should reject the case
not because it's unproven but because it's politically motivated.
Example: ``One of the reasons why we feel that this impeachment
trial is really not what it's purported to be is that there have
been four years of investigations. ... There are people that just
want to get this president'' (Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.).
</P>
<P>
   9. Jury Nullification Nullification. This Republican rejoinder
grants that the House impeachment process was politicized but
argues that 1) the Senate should be above such tawdry politics; and
2) the way to regain public confidence is to transcend partisan
rancor and skepticism by reverting to the innocence of a jury.
Example: ``We're sort of like the petit jury. How we got there,
that's up for somebody else to determine. What we have to look at
is what the facts are'' (DeWine).
</P>
<P>
   10. Democracy. This nuclear response combines the jury
nullification and constitutional duty arguments, suggesting that
Clinton's removal would violate the Constitution and ``undo the
election.'' The purpose of this rhetorical bomb is to annihilate
any discussion of the facts. Example: ``Do I think he answered that
question honestly? No. Do I think what he did was reprehensible?
Absolutely. But the question is, this alone, does it rise to that
level where you overturn an election?'' (Feinstein).
</P>
<P>
   11. Jury Duty. This is Clinton's favorite frame. In the debate
over witnesses, its purpose is to strip Republicans of their
appeals to the Constitution, jury guidelines, and the rule of law.
The argument is that members of Congress have day jobs, and every
day they spend on Clinton's trial--i.e., jury duty--is a day
they're not spending on Social Security, education, and other
issues. When Boxer raised this concern, her Republican colleagues
explained that they were ``two-tracking'' the trial while working
on ``things that affect our constituents.'' That answer won't do.
It lets Clinton's defenders steer the discussion away from the
trial. It grants the distinction between the trial and the people's
business. And it puts the GOP on a collision course with its
argument that Clinton shouldn't deliver his State of the Union
address on Jan. 19. But that's a ``Frame Game'' for another day.

LIVES OF THE ARTISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  By JACOB WEISBERG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Painters, as a rule, have livelier lives than novelists do.
Where a writer basically sits alone at a desk, an artist does his
thing amid a supporting cast of patrons, models, dealers and
assistants. While the novelist hones his private style, the painter
joins and repudiates group movements.
</P>
<P>
   In the misbehavior category, there's not even any comparison. As
Faulkner nips from a flask in the drawer, Pollock makes a boozy
public spectacle of himself. Hemingway might have a few wives, but
Picasso has scores of mistresses. If the writer has mistresses, the
painter has orgies.
</P>
<P>
   All this has made art biographies, since Giorgio Vasari started
writing them in the 16th century, pretty good entertainment. Yet
it's not immediately obvious how such stories help you to
appreciate what's hanging on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to grasp what Harry Truman contributed to
civilization, you would do well to pick up a good bio. You can't
exactly go to a museum to view ``containment policy.'' Artists, by
contrast, endeavor to reach us without words. A critic or art
historian may direct our attention to things we would otherwise
miss. But does the intimate biographer bring us any closer to the
experience of art?
</P>
<P>
   You might derive very different answers to that question from
the three books I read over the holidays. These biographies of
Henri Matisse, Diego Rivera, and Salvador Dali, all of them by
British writers without backgrounds in art, represent alternative
approaches to the problem of writing a painter's life.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Spurling's Matisse is a careful and tightly focused
attempt to illuminate a painter's development. Patrick Marnham's
Rivera is a breezy life and times, a raucous and gossipy tale that
is only secondarily about painting. Ian Gibson's Dali is an
overflowing dumpster of a book, which puts forward an irritating
psychological argument about its subject.
</P>
<P>
   But though the first two of these biographies are excellent and
the third one dreadful, they all butt up against the same generic
problem. Artists' lives are often diverting but seldom
illuminating.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the best of the bunch. Spurling's biography of
Matisse, the first volume of a projected two, is a subtle account
of a great painter's unfolding. The obvious question about Matisse
is how a seed merchant's son from France's ugly and smelly
industrial north became both an inventor of modernism and a master
of Mediterranean color and light.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Unknown Matisse'' gives us his small steps, setbacks, and
radical innovations. Spurling's scoop is her explanation of why,
after moving several increments toward his mature style, the
painter lapsed into a dark period that lasted from 1902-04.
Matisse, she has discovered, was drawn into the scandal arising
from a huge financial fraud in which his wife's parents were
implicated. This took up all his time, strained his meager
resources and gave him a breakdown. Only after his in-laws were
cleared did Matisse make his Fauvist breakthrough in the summer of
1905.
</P>
<P>
   Spurling draws our attention to some of his influences: the
ornate textiles from the Flanders town where he was raised,
paintings by Turner seen on a honeymoon in London and a Cezanne
painting he bought with his family's grocery money.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that is so admirable about Matisse is his quiet
integrity. For the better part of two decades, this reserved man of
regular habits fought poverty, illness, incomprehension and
rejection to make revolutionary painting. His father considered him
a shame to the family and disinherited him. Teachers in Paris told
him he was hopeless. Contemporaries greeted each of his milestone
paintings as more ridiculous than the last. Works such as Matisse's
1907 Blue Nude shocked even rival-to-be Picasso. ``If he wants to
make a woman, let him make a woman. If he wants to make a design,
let him make a design. This is between the two,'' Picasso said.
Soon, Picasso was imitating him.
</P>
<P>
   But even a biography as well-wrought as this one does little to
elucidate artistic inspiration. What made Matisse radically
simplify the figure and flatten three dimensions into two in the
way he did in Harmony in Red (1908)? Spurling informs us that the
pattern on the wallpaper and tablecloth comes from a bolt of blue
cotton cloth that Matisse glimpsed from a bus and that in the
course of revising the painting he changed the background from blue
to red. This is interesting trivia, but it does nothing, really, to
enhance enjoyment of this masterpiece or comprehension of how
Matisse could have painted it.
</P>
<P>
   Diego Rivera had a wilder life than Matisse and produced less
important art, a balance wisely reflected in Marnham's entertaining
biography. Rivera had a lifelong involvement with Marxist and
Mexican politics, countless lovers, famous scandals, and a soap
opera of a marriage (actually two marriages) to Frida Kahlo. He was
also a fabulist of Marquezian proportions, spinning incredible
yarns about his days as a student cannibal or a fighter with
Emiliano Zapata.
</P>
<P>
   The true stories are nearly as good as the imagined ones. Though
Rivera didn't, as he claimed, try to assassinate Hitler, he may
have got Trotsky murdered, writes Marnham. Rivera evicted Trotsky
from the sanctuary of his home in Mexico City when he found out
that Trotsky was having an affair with Kahlo. Kahlo seduced Trotsky
because of her jealousy over the affair Rivera had with her sister.
Without Rivera's protection, Trotsky was easier prey for Stalin's
assassins.
</P>
<P>
   Marnham gives us the Rivera-Kahlo relationship as black comedy.
At one point, Rivera confides to friends that his wife has become
so depressed that he can't even cheer her up by telling her about
his latest sexual conquests.
</P>
<P>
   But in this biography, too, we learn the salient facts of an
artist's development without really coming to understand how they
happened. In Paris before and during World War I, Rivera was a
member of the French avant-garde, executing competent Cubist works
such as Still Life With Liqueur Bottle (1915). After a trip to
Italy, on which he saw the frescoes from the Italian Renaissance,
he dropped Cubism for what soon became his well-known mural
painting.
</P>
<P>
   In the public fresco, Rivera saw the chance to express his
political ideas to the masses. But where did this style come from?
And why do Rivera's murals transcend their propagandistic purpose
in a way that works by his contemporaries don't? The mystery at the
heart of genius remains.
</P>
<P>
   British biographers can usually be counted on to boil things
down for us, but Gibson swamps us with as much boring detail as an
American biographer. His book is crammed full of stray data he has
disinterred about Dali's Catalan ancestors, his sexual obsessions
and infighting within the Surrealist movement, which Dali was
eventually drummed out of for his pro-fascist sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   What Gibson never gets around to telling us is why we should
care. The author assumes that Dali was a great painter, which is
not a given, as with Matisse.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson's big theory is that Dali's life was defined by his
feelings of shame. This hardly amounts to a surprising idea about
the creator of a painting titled The Great Masturbator (1929), but
Gibson treats it as a bolt from the blue. He does not, however,
come close to giving us a sense of what went wrong with Dali's art.
Unlike Matisse and Rivera, who took a couple of decades to attain
their mature styles, Dali's arrival came quick and early.
Surrealism, a style he borrowed from Max Ernst and Yves Tanguy,
gave him a way to express the rancid contents of his own psyche.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to dispute the virtuosity of a painting such as The
Birth of Liquid Desires, painted when he was 28, in 1932. But Dali
rapidly became slack, repetitious, corrupt and in the end
completely pathetic. Gibson chronicles his long degradation but
can't begin to explain it.
</P>
<P>
   After reading these books, I performed an experiment by going to
the Museum of Modern Art in New York and testing my reactions
against the artists in question. Gibson had reduced Dali to a
midget. Several examples of his early works reminded me that he was
not completely worthless after all. A chunk of a Rivera fresco left
me wishing I could see the artist's great murals in Mexico City
again. Finally, I made my way to MoMA's big Matisse room, my
favorite in the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing more about Matisse's struggles had certainly deepened my
respect for him. I could have delivered a short lecture on his
early years. But did the book add anything to my appreciation of
his paintings? I can't say it did.

IN NAPLES, AN OPERA EXALTING REVOLT STIRS JUST THAT  
(RK)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Italy _ Politics, at least the garden variety sort, are
not taken too seriously in Naples. Music, however, is never taken
lightly in this city, the birthplace of bel canto. When the San
Carlo opera house opened its season with a new opera, ``Eleonora,''
starring Vanessa Redgrave as a heroine and martyr of the 1799
Neapolitan uprising, it unleashed angry demonstrations and debate
rivaling the intensity of President Clinton's impeachment trial. On
opening night, local royalists flooded the theater with leaflets
that read ``Jacobin Assassins!''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the opera is not simply a paean to the revolutionaries who
briefly overthrew the monarchy and were later hanged. ``Eleonora,''
created to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the uprising,
provided the respected Italian director and composer Roberto De
Simone with a creative opportunity to weave long-forgotten
18th-century religious music around texts by Leo Tolstoy, Thomas
Mann and Bertolt Brecht, whose words are recited in Italian by
Redgrave.
</P>
<P>
   Staged in Italy's oldest opera house, built by the Bourbons, the
work is an attempt to put a tragic if little-known moment in
Neapolitan history into a broader historical context. Local
citizens may still furiously debate the merits of their aborted
revolution, but the message of ``Eleonora'' is fairly universal: a
protest against the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   And that helped draw Ms. Redgrave to Naples. ``I find the piece
tremendously inspiring,'' the actress said in her dressing room
after Saturday's performance. ``It is against the death penalty by
any government for any reason.'' Warming to her theme, she added,
``The death penalty is a barbaric act, and so is the fact that it
still exists in America, the first country to proclaim the rights
of man.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Redgrave said she was attracted by the work's ``cultural
level'' as well.
</P>
<P>
   The actress, now 61, who studied Italian in school and has a son
by the Italian actor Franco Nero, said she had little difficulty
mastering the long texts in Italian. ``To a certain extent,'' she
said, ``reciting lines is like learning a song in another
language.'' She added, ``Mind you, most songs are not 10 to 14
minutes long. Not even an aria.''
</P>
<P>
   The piece opens with her walking to the edge of the stage and
reciting a 1944 farewell letter by an Italian resistance fighter
condemned to death by the Nazis. Two choirs and opera soloists
perform most of the music, but Ms. Redgrave also sings once, a hymn
to the revolution by the 18th-century Neapolitan composer Domenico
Cimarosa. The song was rediscovered and adapted by De Simone, who
is also the director of the Naples Music Conservatory. Audiences
rewarded the British actress with standing ovations and cries of
``Brava!''
</P>
<P>
   Like many non-Italians, Redgrave said she was unfamiliar with
the facts of the uprising until she was offered the part. She
blamed the British educational system, which she said, ``still
passes over the extremely reactionary role of Nelson in the whole
business of the Bourbons.'' English forces led by Admiral Nelson
helped put down the 1799 uprising and restore the Bourbon royalty
to power.
</P>
<P>
   Eleonora Fonseca Pimentel, the opera's central figure, belonged
to the Portuguese aristocracy, was born in Rome and was raised in
Naples, where she became a poet and frequented literary salons. She
became enamored of the revolutionary ideas of her time and was
imprisoned for Jacobinism in 1798. (The Jacobins, a society of
radical democrats in France during the Revolution of 1789, inspired
similar revolts elsewhere.) When the Bourbon court fled before the
advance of Napoleon's troops, Pimentel was set free and edited an
anti-monarchist newspaper. The Neapolitan peasantry sided against
the Jacobins. When the counter-revolutionary forces of Fabrizio
Cardinal Ruffo, aided by Lord Nelson, put down the uprising,
Pimentel was among the revolutionaries hanged.
</P>
<P>
   Many historians view that episode as the death blow to
liberalism in Southern Italy. ``The liberal elites came out of the
woodwork and were cut down and decimated,'' said Patrice Higgonet,
a professor of French and European history at Harvard University.
``It didn't affect the course of European history, but for Italy it
was as if Madison and Jefferson had been hung after the Battle of
Trenton.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Long a heroine of Italian leftists and feminists, Pimentel is
attracting renewed interest. An Italian-language biography by Maria
Antonietta Macciocchi, ``Cara Eleonora,'' came out in 1993. Susan
Sontag quoted Pimentel's final testament in ``The Volcano Lover: A
Romance,'' a novel about Lord Nelson and Lady Emma Hamilton set in
18th-century Naples. But Pimentel remains largely unknown outside
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   De Simone, 66, said it had never been his intention to create an
opera about her life. Rather, the character of Eleonora, assisted
by that of Pulcinella of the Neopolitan commedia dell'arte, acts as
a guide to an eclectic series of readings, historical tableaux and
ballets. ``For me, she is a great metaphor for all the
revolutionaries who ended up being executed,'' De Simone said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the choral singing is church music by the 18th-century
Neapolitan composers Cimarosa, Giovanni Paisiello, Leonardo Leo and
Francesco Durante. De Simone recruited young music scholars at the
Naples Conservatory to study and adapt the works for modern
orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   De Simone said he had no difficulty blending parts of a Requiem
Mass with Jacobin revolutionary themes and excerpts from the
writings of figures like the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky or
Ruben Dario, the Nicaraguan poet. ``Christ was the first
revolutionary and he ended up on the cross,'' De Simone said.
</P>
<P>
   But the director said he was distressed by the political tumult
surrounding his piece, much of it criticism from conservative
politicians angry that public money was spent to commemorate an
uprising they still view as treason.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is disinformation,'' De Simone said. ``My vision is one
of disenchantment with violence, be it revolutionary or by the
powers that be.'' He added: ``I can't win. Twenty-five years ago, I
revived popular 18th-century music that was pro-Bourbon and I was
attacked by the pro-Jacobins.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian critics responded skeptically to his effort to be
evenhanded. Under the headline ``Lots of Rhetoric, Little Depth,''
Paolo Isotta, the opera critic of the Corriere della Sera
newspaper, wrote, ``It reminds one of the usual Brechtian didactic
theater of the 1950s, with a little bit of plastic surgery and
little else.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the opening was a major event. The premiere on Friday was
attended by Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, many government
ministers, lawmakers including right-wing Alessandra Mussolini and
celebrities. The performance was projected on a giant screen across
the street from the San Carlo opera house. (The only other time the
San Carlo has arranged such a presentation was for a sold-out
Pavarotti concert.)
</P>
<P>
   The performance was also broadcast on Italian television and
radio. Neapolitan newspapers ran breathless front-page articles on
every angle from neo-Bourbon discontent to Ms. Redgrave's appetite
at dinner after the premiere. (``Robusto,'' one paper reported
approvingly.)
</P>
<P>
   In the end, local pride triumphed over partisan differences. In
an article on the 11 p.m. television broadcast of ``Eleonora,''
which fewer than 300,000 people watched, a headline in the local
paper Il Mattino put it this way: ``Few Viewers but of High
Quality.''

<P>
   CORPACANCHA, Peru _ Claudencia Martin Gustavo cheered when
President Alberto K. Fujimori, defying the thin mountain air in
this remote village 12,000 feet above sea level, took two women
into his arms and twirled them in a vigorous Indian folk dance.
</P>
<P>
   He cheered as the president passed out pink blouses and beige
pants to local llama and alpaca herders. And he cheered again when
the Peruvian leader, already in campaign mode, donned a rather
unpresidential poncho, and talked about bringing telephones and
electricity to this settlement of 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   But Gustavo said he doubted he would vote a third time for
Fujimori next year because ``we don't have enough food and our
incomes are not enough for our families.''
</P>
<P>
   A deepening recession caused by stormy weather and the Asian
economic crisis has swung Peru's political mood against the
president who has dominated this country for nearly a decade. Once
widely popular for rescuing Peru from the abyss of terrorism,
cocaine trafficking and hyperinflation, Fujimori is struggling to
recapture his old magic that has brought him two election
victories. Whether he can regain it will determine if he will run
again next year.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Japanese immigrants, Fujimori bolted out of nowhere
as an independent populist to win the presidency in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But he governed as a tough-minded, free-market conservative.
Faced with a spreading wave of terrorism, he unleashed the military
and intelligence services and quickly captured the most important
rebel leaders. He even ordered the air force to shoot down planes
loaded with Peruvian coca paste destined for Colombia leading to a
rapid decline in trafficking and coca cultivation.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Fuji-shock,'' treatment yielded a wave of privatizations
of inefficient state enterprises and attracted foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
   And with crucial military support, he replaced the Congress and
Supreme Court in 1992, with like-minded officials. His actions drew
heavy criticism from the United States and human rights activists,
but the terrorists lost ground and Fujimori won re-election
overwhelmingly in 1995 over former United Nations Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar.
</P>
<P>
   But now the 60-year-old president's support in the polls, which
has risen and fallen in the past, has dwindled to about 35 percent,
and has hardly budged over the last four months.
</P>
<P>
   His popularity has declined even after he successfully
negotiated a peace treaty with Ecuador late last year, forcing him
to replace his prime minister and shuffle his Cabinet last week. A
frightening crime wave in Lima early last year abated after
Fujimori ordered Peru's intelligence services to infiltrate street
gangs and arrest their leaders, but even that has not helped his
standing.
</P>
<P>
   While he has not signaled his political intentions, his
supporters say he is privately gearing up to run again. But some
analysts say that if his polls do not improve in the next six to
eight months, Fujimori may decide to forego the election.
</P>
<P>
   His standing has deteriorated mainly owing to a recession that
resulted first from El Nino, which caused major flood damage and
pushed important varieties of fish from Peru's shoreline, causing
hardship for the country's substantial fishmeal industry.
</P>
<P>
   A decline in commodities prices brought on by the Asian crisis,
especially for Peru's copper and tin, has reduced economic growth.
Indeed, the once white-hot Peruvian economy that registered
double-digit growth rates in the early 1990's stalled to zero
growth in the last quarter. The unemployment and underemployment
rate has risen in recent months from 40 percent to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are hungry, unemployed and tired of Fujimori,''
said Javier Valle Riestra, who served as prime minister for two
months last year. ``He can only make it to re-election by fraud and
blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has been buffeted by widespread criticism that he
manipulated the courts and electoral tribunals to sidestep a
constitutional ban on a third term. Fujimori's claims that his 1992
``self-coup'' improved the justice system has been tarnished in
recent months by scandals, including two judges recently filmed
taking bribes from drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   And a new book about Vladimiro Montesinos, Fujimori's unofficial
chief of intelligence, describes the president as a virtual
prisoner of a sinister, power-hungry spy. The book has become an
instant best-seller sold at newsstands around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori cannot be counted out, however. The Ministry of the
Presidency controls 40 percent of the national budget, and it is
already turning on a pork-barrel spigot for bridges and roads. And
the opposition remains splintered. The strongest possible
opposition candidate, Alberto Andrade, was recently re-elected
mayor of Lima, but his organization is weak in the provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, opinion polls and political analysts suggest that
the brief surge Fujimori received in 1997 by the rescue operation
of 71 hostages held by terrorists in the Japanese ambassador's
residence has faded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say re-election is possible, but very difficult,''
said Alfredo Torres, a leading Lima poll taker. ``The question is
whether the recuperation of the Peruvian and world economy will
come fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Fujimori predicted that his new Cabinet
would help his government recover much of its luster. He said he
would be able to crank up economic growth by better the 5 percent
this year _ far higher than the consensus 2 percent of independent
economists _ unless neighboring Brazil suffers a complete economic
meltdown. Things will be better, he said, if for no other reason
than there will be not be an El Nino this year.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori made many promises, as he doodled on a piece of paper
in a wood-paneled office in the government palace. He pledged to
further reduce Peru's coca-growing area _ already cut by more than
half in three years thanks partly to eradication _ by an additional
20 to 30 percent this year. He predicted that the new treaty with
Ecuador would lead to yearly savings of $400 million in military
spending. And he promised to hunt down the handful of rebels left
in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before there was terrorism, now there is stability,'' Fujimori
said, as if practicing a campaign speech. ``Before we had economic
chaos, now we have order. Before we were isolated internationally,
now we have friends again. Before we had conflict with Ecuador, now
we live in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   He refused to rule out a re-election bid, adding, ``I don't have
to decide yet.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   But for the last two years, Fujimori and his allies who form a
majority in Congress have been acting as if the Peruvian leader
intends to run in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 Peruvian Constitution prohibits the president from
running for a third consecutive term. But in August 1996,
Fujimori's supporters in Congress passed a law that granted him an
exception, arguing that his first term did not count since it began
before the new constitution was written.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the opposition appealed to the seven-member
Constitutional Tribunal, saying the exemption was unconstitutional.
Three of the judges agreed, three abstained, and the head
constitutional judge upheld the 3-0 decision against Fujimori. In
May 1997, Congress dismissed the three judges who opposed their law
on the ground that they had exceeded their authority, opening the
way for a third Fujimori campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition mounted a signature drive to petition Congress to
hold a national referendum on the issue of a third term.
</P>
<P>
   By July 1998, it had collected enough signatures to hold a
referendum. But the Congress ruled that two-thirds of its members
would have to clear the way for any referendum, and Fujimori's
majority blocked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do not trust civilian, democratic institutions,'' said
Lourdes Flores Nano, an opposition congresswoman. ``The polls say
he can't win, but if the group at the head of the army insists on
Fujimori the possibility of fraud is very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori denied that he had manipulated the system and said
Congress was doing its democratic duty. ``I think we have a very
open, democratic system, even with its imperfections,'' he said.
``Before Peru had a democracy, but one that didn't function in the
face of terrorism and narcoterrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   He underscored how much Peru has changed on his trip to
Corpacancha. He would not have dared come to this Andean village 85
miles northeast of Lima without an army battalion when he first
took office in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, young Shining Path terrorists played soccer with
the skulls of their victims in these Andean highlands. As part of
their effort to terrorize the peasantry into submission, they
rounded up local leaders in village squares and then ordered their
relatives to stone them to death at gunpoint. The army was in
retreat until the security forces arrested the top terrorist
leaders in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But this Sunday, Fujimori dropped by this settlement in a
helicopter with only a light escort of bodyguards to enjoy a
mountainside picnic, pass out gifts and dole out promises of new
roads, tourism projects and credits to expand their llama, alpaca
and sheep production.
</P>
<P>
   As the peasants swelled around him, tussling him as they
received their gifts, he cried out: ``Order! Order! This country
needs order, no?''
</P>
<P>
   The peasants dutifully obeyed, like recruits following a drill
sergeant, as the chaos gave way to three neat lines.
</P>
<P>
   In appreciation for the presidential gifts, the peasants gave
Fujimori a sheep with the Peruvian flag tied around its neck and a
hunk of barbecued alpaca to go with the French wine and Polish
vodka he brought along on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Fujimori assembled the reporters traveling with him, and
via satellite telephone, gave a nationally broadcast news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government gets results,'' Fujimori told his people.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In their trial briefs, the president's defense team
and the House prosecutors present their Senate jury with a legal
version of ``Rashomon,'' in which the main characters recall the
same events differently.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers, who submitted their brief on Monday, weave
an elaborate narrative in which the president is a corrupt
protagonist, orchestrating a scheme to hide evidence of an illicit
relationship from the lawyers for Paula Jones. In their version of
Clinton's actions, the president is a conspirator who influences
Monica Lewinsky to falsely deny their affair in a sworn affidavit.
He then uses his loyal secretary to conceal gifts he and Ms.
Lewinsky exchanged and to cover up their relationship, and he
attempts to find the former intern a job to insure her silence in
the Jones case. Finally, he lies about it all before a federal
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``When viewed as a unified whole,'' the brief of the House
managers concludes, the evidence ``overwhlemingly supports'' two
articles of impeachment against President Clinton for perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The 130-page trial memorandum submitted on Wednesday by the
president's lawyers paints an altogether different picture of the
same events. The defense brief portrays a president beset by his
enemies, threatened by a politically motivated civil lawsuit and an
independent counsel bent on finding wrongdoing by the president
after years of fruitlessly investigating the Whitewater real estate
deal in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Far from committing perjury or obstructing justice, the
president's lawyers argue, he was simply attempting to conceal an
illicit affair and hide his own embarrassing behavior from his
family and closest aides. When he appeared before a federal grand
jury, however, the president told the truth, the lawyers say,
admitting to an ``inappropriate, intimate'' relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The briefs differ markedly in style as well as substance. What
is most striking about the House brief is its almost novelistic
structure, which lays out a highly detailed story alleging perjury
and obstruction of justice with chronological chapters and
subheadings such as ``Ms. Lewinsky's First Visit'' and ``Need For
The Cover Story.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's brief is filled with legal citations and
arguments that the charges against Clinton do not rise to the level
of impeachable offenses. ``The articles of impeachment that have
been exhibited to the Senate fall far short of what the Founding
Fathers had in mind when they placed in the hands of Congress the
power to impeach and remove a president from office,'' his lawyers
argue. But their brief too has some provocative subchapters,
including a section titled ``The Whitewater Investigative
Dead-End'' that contends the independent counsel's investigation of
Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky was ``wholly unrelated'' to its original
mandate.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the two briefs are indicators of two very
different trial strategies. The House managers want a longer trial
with the testimony of witnesses. Proving that the facts square with
the emphatic allegations in their brief, which in places goes
beyond even the impeachment referral of the independent counsel
Kenneth Starr, would almost certainly require the testimony of
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Although the defense brief disputes the facts in the Starr
referral, it trivializes the actual charges against the president,
minimizes the seriousness of the evidence against him and
criticizes the very structure of the impeachment articles,
whichunconstitutionally contain multiple offenses, the brief
contends. If they were counts in an indictment ``would not survive
a motion to dismiss,'' it contends. The president's lawyers want a
short trial with no witnesses, and they want it decided on the
basis that the case against Clinton is not serious enough to
warrant removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   The House brief, to a far lesser extent than the president's,
does not split the case into two parts, dividing it by the separate
perjury and obstruction charges. The House brief argues that it is
necessary to view the case as a whole and not by pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential to avoid considering each event in
isolation,'' the House managers maintain. ``Events and words that
may seem innocent or even exculpatory in a vacuum may well take on
a sinister, or even a criminal, connotation when observed in the
context of the whole plot.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's brief, by contrast, dissects each article, piece
by piece. On perjury, the president's lawyers argue that the House
case rests on ``such insignificant matters as misremembering the
precise months on which certain inappropriate physical contact
started'' and ``understanding as `occasional' his infrequent
inappropriate physical and telephone contacts with Ms. Lewinsky
over a period of many months.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his grand jury testimony, the president's prepared statement
said his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky spanned 1996 and 1997,
while she said it began in late 1995. She described 11 sexual
encounters with the president and 17 telephone conversations that
involved sexual banter.
</P>
<P>
   Because the president admitted to an ongoing physical
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in his grand jury statement, the
president's lawyers dismiss discrepancies between his testimony and
Ms. Lewinsky's over the number and dates of their encounters,
saying that ``these squabbles are utterly immaterial.''
</P>
<P>
   As to clashes in their testimony over the nature of their sexual
contact, the president's lawyers repeat their prior insistence that
President Clinton believed oral sex did not fall within the
definition of sexual relations in the Jones case and that other
intimiate touching alleged by Ms. Lewinsky ``comes down to an oath
against an oath.''
</P>
<P>
   This argument of course, could undermine Ms. Lewinsky's
credibility when it comes to the second article of impeachment, for
obstruction of justice. Here the president's brief relies on Ms.
Lewinsky's testimony that no one ever told her to lie and that she
was never promised a job for her silence.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers' brief argues that no one would have ever
stated those aims so boldly to Ms. Lewinsky. The brief also argues
that the president's conversations with Ms. Lewinsky about her
affidavit in the Jones case and efforts to find her a job after she
appeared on the Jones witness list strongly suggest an unlawful
scheme to shape her testimony. The president's lawyers counter that
efforts to help Ms. Lewinsky find employment began long before she
became embroiled in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   The briefs also clash sharply on the proper standards and
precedents for the impeachment of federal officeholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate's own precedents establish beyond doubt that
perjury warrants conviction and removal,'' the House managers
maintain, pointing out that the 1980's the Senate convicted and
removed three federal judges for committing perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The president's brief cites other precedents, noting, for
instance, a proposed article of impeachment against President Nixon
that was rejected by the House Judiciary Committee involved private
wrongdoing and the filing of a fraudulent tax return. The brief
also reaches back to 1792, when Congress investigated Treasury
Secretary Alexander Hamilton for taking payments from a swindler, a
private matter that was deemed unworthy of removing Hamilton from
office.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers, however, soundly reject the notion that the
president's dealings with Ms. Lewinsky and his testimony about it
are a private matter. ``This case is not about sex or private
conduct,'' their brief states. ``It is about multiple obstructions
of justice, perjury, false and misleading statements, and witness
tampering -- all committed or orchestrated by the president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, despite the more than 50 pages of detailed narrative in
the House managers brief, the president's lawyers argue that the
charges against him are unfairly vague.

<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Lottery fever hit South Carolina Wednesday, and
it had nothing to do with the size of the Powerball jackpot. The
state's 114th governor, James H. Hodges, used his inauguration
ceremonies to begin lobbying for ambitious educational improvements
that he maintains can only be paid for through a statewide lottery.
</P>
<P>
   He may not have to lobby very hard. Convinced that Hodges'
victory in November served as a referendum on the lottery,
legislative leaders are predicting that lawmakers will approve a
measure this session to allow a public vote on the issue. Many of
those lawmakers remain personally opposed to the lottery, but have
said the election made it clear that South Carolinians want to join
the legal numbers racket.
</P>
<P>
   As legislative sessions open around the country, South Carolina
is one of four Southern states where the Bible Belt's once zealous
opposition to legalized gambling is being overwhelmed by the dire
need to improve public schools. Six of the 13 states that do not
have lotteries are in the South, but political experts predict that
South Carolina, Alabama, North Carolina and Tennessee could all
adopt lotteries in the next few years. Most of those states would
have to amend their constitutions to make the lottery legal,
meaning that legislatures would have to pass measures _ sometimes
by two-thirds majorities _ in order to place a referendum before
voters.
</P>
<P>
   As in South Carolina, resistance to the lottery is crumbling in
Alabama, where Don Siegelman will be sworn in as governor on Monday
after waging a campaign in which he spoke about virtually nothing
else. In his election-night victory speech, Siegelman defied
lottery opponents in the legislature ``to stand in the way of the
will of the people.'' To reinforce that point, he will be sworn in
on Monday by former Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia, who left office
this week with record approval ratings after bringing
lottery-funded college scholarships and pre-kindergarten programs
to his state.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-lottery momentum in South Carolina and Alabama has
spread to the neighboring states of North Carolina and Tennessee,
where political leaders fear the loss of potential tax revenue
across state lines. Ever since Georgia began its lottery in 1993,
leaders in adjacent states have watched helplessly as their
citizens drove across that state's border to spend millions of
dollars on lottery tickets. As long as their citizens are going to
gamble, the politicians figure, the proceeds might as well benefit
their schools. That reasoning has created a domino effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the surrounding states have lotteries or anticipate
getting them, so it seems like the Tennessee voters should have a
chance to vote on it,'' said state Sen. Ward Crutchfield, a
Chattanooga Democrat who serves as majority leader. ``People are
pouring into Kentucky and Georgia to play it and I'm tired of
supporting other states' education systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is one of three states, along with Hawaii and Utah,
that do not have any form of legalized gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hodges and Siegelman are Democrats who used their lottery
proposals to oust Republican incumbents in deeply conservative
states, and their victories sent a clear message to legislators
across the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've seen two incumbent Republican governors in the South
defeated by that issue, so people are scrambling to get on the
right side of it,'' said Q. Whitfield Ayres, a pollster in Atlanta.
``When the people speak, politicians listen and people in
neighboring states spoke loudly and convincingly on the lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodges opposed the lottery while a state legislator, but changed
his views while campaigning for governor, saying he had shifted
after studying the success of Georgia's program. In the last five
years, that lottery has paid for college scholarships for 319,000
students and for pre-kindergarten classes for 246,000 4-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's inaugural on the Capitol steps, Hodges reinforced
the imagery of his education agenda by asking his 5-year-old son,
Luke, and the other members of Luke's kindergarten class to lead
the Pledge of Allegiance. Each of the children wore inaugural
sweatshirts saying: ``It's All About Our Schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything else, all our hopes and dreams for economic
prosperity, preserving our precious natural resources, appreciation
for diversity in the decades to come, everything else depends on a
first-rate program of public education,'' Hodges said. ``That is
why I am asking all South Carolinians today to join me in launching
a children's crusade, a 21st century crusade of textbooks and
computers and parents and teachers, allied against the enemies of
ignorance and indifference.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Because the Hodges administration is committed to
improving education without tax increases, we must adopt a
statewide lottery with all the revenues targeted for specific
educational needs.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As a political device, the lottery has been a silver bullet for
Southern Democrats because it has allowed them to propose
significant spending on education without tax increases that
alienate conservative voters. Their Republican opponents typically
have been forced to oppose the lottery in order to maintain the
backing of Christian conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But after the elections of Hodges and Siegelman, Republican
lawmakers are relaxing their opposition. ``I'm not an advocate of
the lottery but I realize that the public has spoken,'' said Al B.
Robinson, a Republican state representative from Easley, S.C., who
has voted against a lottery referendum in the past but said he will
vote for one this year.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker of the Republican-controlled House, David H.
Wilkins, said in an interview that he opposes the lottery but
believes it will win the two-thirds majority needed to be placed on
the ballot as a referendum in 2000. ``I think it's going to be
close but my sense is it will probably pass,'' he said. An analysis
in Wednesday's editions of The State, Columbia's newspaper,
projected that 87 House members would support a lottery referendum,
four more than are needed for passage.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, the lottery's odds have improved because
Democrats won back control of the state House of Representatives in
November. Previous speakers from both parties have blocked lottery
bills in the House, but the likely new Speaker, Jim Black of
Charlotte, has said he would allow a vote on the lottery even
though he opposes it. Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. also has personal
reservations, but supports letting the voters decide.
</P>
<P>
   Polls in each of the states have found that large majorities
support the lottery. A poll taken last July for The Charlotte
Observer found that 68 percent of North Carolinians and 73 percent
of South Carolinians favored a lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery opponents will continue to argue that lotteries prey on
the poor, encourage gambling addiction, open the door to other
forms of gambling, and leave government dependent on unreliable
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats have used lotteries very effectively as a
political crowbar,'' said Tom Grey, director of the National
Coalition Against Gambling Expansion. ``They've been able to play
one state against the other states, but there's not a debate over
whether this is good public policy.''

COMMENTARY: THE POLITICS OF CRUELTY
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Barry Turner lives alone in a fifth-floor walkup on a
quiet street in the Prospect Heights section of Brooklyn. He's a
nervous man. Fidgets all the time. He smokes Kool cigarettes and
drinks prodigious amounts of orange Kool-Aid. He suffers from
obsessive-compulsive disorder. He takes two types of medication to
stave off psychotic episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first started noticing the symptoms in 1993,'' said Turner.
``I was a foot messenger. When I would ride the subways, yeah, my
mouth would start twitching. Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the crowds on the trains bothered him. ``I just would
start thinking, `Oh, I might say something to somebody who was
staring at me.' And then the mouth twitching would start and I'd
have to get off and wait for another train. And then my boss would
say, `What did you do, go sightseeing?'''
</P>
<P>
   Turner sat at his kitchen table Tuesday and talked about his
precarious day-to-day existence. Five days a week he goes to a
state-run psychiatric center in the Cobble Hill neighborhood where
he gets his medication and counseling. The center is affiliated
with the South Beach Psychiatric Facility on Staten Island and
serves about 500 mentally ill patients.
</P>
<P>
   For Turner, the center has meant the difference between
stability and chaos. ``Since South Beach, I seem to feel much
better,'' he said. ``I don't feel as nervous as I did in '93. I'm
trying to test myself in the subways and buses to see if I can
manage once again to go to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner was more nervous than usual during the interview because
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had threatened to evict the psychiatric
center from its city-owned building and replace it with a homeless
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   This was a typically grotesque Giuliani gesture. Never mind that
the psychiatric center by all accounts has been successfully
helping troubled individuals for decades, and that it was welcomed
by its Cobble Hill neighbors. The mayor was angry with the local
councilman, Stephen DiBrienza, for sponsoring homeless legislation
that the mayor didn't like. So he decided to punish DiBrienza and
his constituents by evicting the psychiatric center and forcing a
homeless shelter into its space. A homeless shelter that was not
needed.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition to the mayor's plan was 100 percent. The New York
Times, in an editorial, said, ``This stacks up as revenge politics,
no matter how the mayor's aides spin it.'' Five hundred people
showed up at a community meeting last week to denounce the mayor's
plan. James Brennan, a Brooklyn Democrat and chairman of the
Assembly's Mental Health Committee, sent the mayor a letter that
said, ``In my 14 years in office I have never seen a more
irresponsible, immature and abusive misuse of high office.'' The
Legal Aid Society threatened to file a lawsuit on behalf of the
mentally ill patients served by the psychiatric center.
</P>
<P>
   After my interview with Turner, I learned that the mayor had
bowed to the pressure and backed off. The psychiatric center can
stay, he said. But other agencies in the six-story building,
including programs that help the elderly and young children, will
have to go. A homeless shelter is going into the building, the
mayor said, and that's that.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has raised the politics of cruelty to a high art. Among
the programs to be evicted are Heights and Hills, which provides
services to frail and otherwise vulnerable senior citizens, and
Families First, a program that offers parenting help and day care
to families with children under 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``So he's evicting infants, toddlers and elderly folks with
Alzheimer's,'' said Brennan.
</P>
<P>
   This is a purely destructive move by the mayor. No one is
unhappy with the programs, but he is unhappy with DiBrienza so he
is bulldozing them.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during my visit, Barry Turner stood up from the
table and poured a large glass of Kool-Aid. He drank it down fast,
and poured another. I asked if he smoked much. He said yes, the
Kools help keep him from coughing.
</P>
<P>
   Later I wondered about the elderly, some of them nervous and
forgetful, who will be looking for help in new venues if the mayor
gets his way. And the children whose families may become
destabilized without the help they get from Families First.
</P>
<P>
   Politics in the wrong hands can be a terrible thing.

INDIA FILM INDUSTRY IS REELING, BUT HOPEFUL FOR COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India _ The word is out in international film circles
that the once mighty Indian cinema _ the largest, most prolific,
perhaps most colorful and distinctive in the world _ is, for the
first time in its history, in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 30 years and more, Bollywood _ as this Bombay-based
industry calls itself _ has been the one great holdout to the
Hollywoodization of the planet: a vibrant national cinema cranking
out an average of 800 films a year to a devoted domestic
theater-going audience of more than 14 million per day.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1998, it was hard to pick up a serious film journal
without reading at least one portent of Bollywood doom. Even the
usually upbeat International Film Guide, the bible of world cinema
statistics, reported the Indian cinema had hit ``the lowest ebb in
its 67-year talkie history.''
</P>
<P>
   Variety's India correspondent, Uma da Cunha, reported that
throughout the past year, Indian audiences have kept away from
movie theaters in droves. In 1998, ``nothing seemed to work.
Comedies, tragedies, musicals, fantasies, even big-budget,
star-laden bonanzas _ thumbs down greeted the lot.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, liberalized trade policies resulted in more
Hollywood films being released in India than ever before _ more
than 150 in 1998 _ and many thrived. One of Bombay's
English-language dailies noted sadly that ``India's movie event of
1998 was called `Titanic.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite these faltering vital signs, Indian filmmakers
themselves seem determined that their cinema will not wither and
die. One noted Bombay producer recently vowed to CNN: ``Anyone
expecting another Hong Kong (whose film industry all but collapsed
last year) here is likely to be disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   My own quick trip through Bollywood found an industry that was
reeling from its worst year ever, and struggling to figure out just
what its problem is, but also amazingly confident of its paramount
place in India's cultural life and certain that its vast audience
can and will be lured back.
</P>
<P>
   This optimism was buoyed by the fact that December finally
produced the 1998 Bombay movie year's first two bona fide
box-office hits _ the romantic comedies, ``Kuch Kuch Hota Hain''
and ``Bade Miya Chlote Miyan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can hear the collective sigh of relief reverberating
around Bollywood,'' India's Cineblitz Magazine observed.
</P>
<P>
   At Film City, the sprawling, government-owned studio in the
northern suburbs, a spokesman said that ``an even more positive
life sign'' is that the box-office depression has not depressed
production. ``At the moment, our sound stages are full. Some 679
films were produced in India last year _ down a bit from the past
few years _ but not drastically. The new year is likely to see as
many or more.''
</P>
<P>
   This is partly, he said, because the new Hindu-nationalist
government in Delhi has helped the industry get funding, for the
first time, from the nation's big commercial banks. And partly
because ``every Bombay yuppie who makes a killing still wants to
invest it in a movie.'' (The same could be said of the Bombay
underworld, which reportedly finances 5 percent of the industry
with ``black money.'')
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone here disputes or pooh-poohs the evidence of
Hollywood's increasing market share in India. Movie analyst (or
film-wallah, as he's known) S.V. Singh said, ``Yes, the Regal
(Bombay's top Raj-era movie palace) is playing `X-Files,' and
Hollywood rules most of the downtown cinemas. But that's still only
eight out of 250 theaters in the city. And, with the exception of
`Titanic,' no Hollywood blockbuster has ever appeared on the list
of India's top five grossing hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh believes the statistics also don't take into account how
important the film industry is to India, the crucial role
Hindi-language films play in uniting the numerous linguistic,
ethnic and religious factions that make up the subcontinent and
giving India a common identity. ``It may be our most vital
industry. We can no more afford to let it die than you can let
Boeing or General Motors die.''
</P>
<P>
   The statistics also don't take into account how deeply ingrained
movie culture is in India _ the strength of its star system, for
instance. How photos of Indian movie idols seem to adorn every shop
window in every town and village. Indeed, the first thing a visitor
to India invariably notices are the gigantic movie billboards on
every corner.
</P>
<P>
   India is not only the most movie-mad nation on Earth, it's also
the most knowledgeable about its own movie heritage. Any taxi
driver picked at random can probably give you a detailed tour of
the movie-star homes in Juhu Beach and Malabar Hill _ Bombay's
Malibu and Beverly Hills. And every Bombay schoolboy knows the
names, dates and filmography of India's movie pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Film historian Arthur Knight has noted that India embraced
movies before most European countries. In fact, the first public
screenings in Bombay (by the Lumiere Brothers, at the Watson Hotel)
were as early as 1896, and Bombay had its equivalent of the
nickelodeon at ``about the same time as New York.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1911, Bombay impresario D.P. Phalke _ the father of Indian
cinema _ directed India's first feature film, ``Rajah
Harishandra,'' taken from the Hindu epic, ``The Mahabharata.'' The
film was such a big hit that it single-handedly established a
booming silent film industry in India that, by 1929, was turning
out well over 100 features a year.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of sound, of course, posed special problems in a
country with 18 official languages and more than 1,000 recognized
dialects, and India's film industry soon fragmented into a dozen or
more regional cinemas: Bengali-language films in Calcutta,
Tamil-language films in Madras, Hindi (nominally the national
language) films in Bombay.
</P>
<P>
   And, while the rest of the regional cinemas were feeding
regional tastes and nourishing obscure art-film movements _
Calcutta's Satyajit Ray, for instance _ Bombay, with the most money
and best facilities, wisely decided to concentrate on the kind of
big-star, big-budget musical escapism that could cross India's many
cultural barriers to become the ``All-India film.''
</P>
<P>
   By the mid '50s, the Bombay musical had evolved into what is now
known as the masala (collection of spices) movie: a gaudy, usually
mindless, three-hour formula film that mixes music (often dozens of
songs), stars (all gorgeous), innocent young love (with no sexual
contact, even kissing), stylized action sequences (no blood) and a
happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   In isolation from the rest of the movie world, a unique
masala-movie culture developed: a cinema driven by a fierce star
system (with the biggest stars so in demand that they may be making
10 movies at once), a powerful synergy with the music industry (in
India, movie music is pop music), and such an insatiable demand
from the Indian masses _ and overseas Indian communities around the
world _ that as many as 1,000 films might be cranked out in a good
year.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why that audience has turned off to masala films so
suddenly and so completely is hard to understand, especially since
the industry seemed to weather the advent of television and video
in the late '80s so well. But the consensus of the film-wallahs is
that the Indian film audience is simply more sophisticated than it
used to be, and the old masala formula has worn thin.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in Showtime, one of Bombay's dozen or so slick,
English-language movie magazines, critic Ashok Banker charges
``Hindi films have lost their flavor, their taste. They've become a
bastardized form that is neither commercially viable nor
artistically successful.'' He demands that Bollywood emulate
Hollywood by abandoning its reliance on masala musicals and
producing films in distinct, American-style genres. ``Comedies.
Love stories. Action. Historicals. Horror. Suspense. Family
socials.''
</P>
<P>
   Others _ and not just conservative Hindu groups (see the
accompanying story on the movie ``Fire'') _ are less sure of this
American direction, and already see signs of an adverse social
impact from the lessening of censorship and import quotas in the
'90s: the ``wet sari'' scene that now seems to be in every movie,
the increasingly brutal and violent gangster sagas that play off
the mythology of the Bombay underworld, the recent vogue for
splatter-movie horror.
</P>
<P>
   Mira Nair, India's best known expat-filmmaker (``Salaam
Bombay!,'' ``Kama Sutra''), built her career in western art houses,
but she too feels that copying successful Hollywood formulas would
be a disastrous course for the Bombay industry. In an interview
last year, she said, ``I don't make masala movies, and don't much
patronize them. But I recognize that they're indigenously Indian.
If the genre goes, let's just hope that whatever replaces it will
be as positive and popular, and as reflective of India's culture _
not America's.''

`FIRE' FUROR SPOTLIGHTS INDIAN DILEMMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No event of recent years has underscored the divisions facing
India's vast but troubled film industry as dramatically as the
turbulent opening last month of the appropriately named
Canadian-Indian movie, ``Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, which played at the 1997 Seattle International Film
Festival, is an intelligent and moving family drama about a
neglected new bride who moves into a large traditional Indian
family and gradually falls in love with _ and has an affair with _
her equally neglected mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a lesbian movie, it's more a parable about how male
insensitivity and an intransigent, male-dominated, Hindu society
drive the two women together _ less from a suppressed sexual
longing as an emotional starvation, a need for a fulfilling human
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Since I had met the director, Deepa Mehta, knew the film well
and had championed it in several reviews (before it went on to win
14 international awards), I made it a point while I was in India to
follow how it was received by its target audience.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, as the first film with even a modest lesbian
love scene to pass India's strict censor board, it was a media
event even before it opened, providing an occasion for India's
various gay-rights and feminist groups to debate the issues it
raised. (``With the release of `Fire,' female relationships come
into full and fiery focus,'' said the Times of India, in a
full-page Op-Ed piece.)
</P>
<P>
   It was also a box-office smash. The morning of the film's Bombay
opening, I went down to the New Empire Theater, a Raj-era movie
palace, and found that the queue for the first two matinee showings
(one in Hindi, one in English) stretched around the theater and
five blocks down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Chatting with young people in the queue, it was apparent that
some had showed up in hopes of seeing an explicit sex film (which
``Fire'' definitely is not), but most were there for higher
purposes. A 20-year-old student from nearby Bombay University told
me, ``You can't imagine what a rarity it is to have a socially
relevant Indian movie playing in one of the big Bombay movie
houses. It's truly an event.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the front of the line were maybe a dozen protesters _
members, it turned out, of the Shiv Sena: the most radical,
far-right party in the Hindu Nationalist coalition that has
governed India since last February, and the party that currently
runs India's huge Maharashtra Province.
</P>
<P>
   The Shiv Sena leader, Balasaheb Thackeray, has publicly praised
Adolf Hitler, and has enthusiastically supported the violent Hindu
extremist attacks on Muslims, Sikhs and Christians in India that
have claimed well over 1,000 lives in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The Shiv Sena has set itself up as the fundamentalist Hindu
equivalent of America's Christian Coalition. Without having seen
``Fire,'' they denounced it as ``disgusting,'' ``social AIDS'' and
even ``an attack on Hindu culture.'' ``This movie will corrupt
young minds,'' one demonstrator chanted. ``Lesbianism is not part
of Indian culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the demonstration was peaceful and mostly ignored. The
film played to large crowds for over a week without incident. But
when I returned to Bombay a week later, the first thing that
greeted me at Sahar Airport was a TV broadcast showing scenes of a
Shiv Sena mob ``in the process of destroying the New Empire
Theater.''
</P>
<P>
   A goon squad of some 200 men and women rampaged through the
theater, assaulted moviegoers in the queue, smashed windows and
ripped down the ``Fire'' posters. By the time I got there, the New
Empire (an art-deco landmark which underwent a restoration only
last year) was a ruin, the police had cordoned off the area and the
exhibition of ``Fire'' was history.
</P>
<P>
   The film was scheduled to open the next day at the Regal Theater
in New Delhi and the Shiv Sena announced that if it did this scene
would be repeated. Apparently, this opening was particularly
offensive to them because the Regal Theater was a sacred site to
Hindu supremacy: the spot where, 49 years ago, Gandhi's assassins _
ex-members of the Shiv Sena's parent organization, the RSS _ met on
the fateful morning of the murder in January 1948.
</P>
<P>
   I flew to New Delhi that morning. This time, I watched about a
dozen Shiv Sena activists _ including three women with canes _
threaten the terrified manager, disperse the line of moviegoers,
smash the glass in the ticket booth and display windows, and force
their way into the theater, chanting slogans, smashing the food
counter and terrorizing patrons. Outside, other Shiv Sena tore up
the film's posters and billboards, and set them ablaze in a
bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the Shiv Sena was arrested. A Regal Theater
spokesman quickly backed down from the theater's initial stance and
said that the film would be withdrawn.The next day, Manohar Joshi,
the chief minister of Maharashtra Province not only condoned the
attack on the two theaters, he ``congratulated'' the Shiv Sena on
its ``achievement'' (according to accounts in several
English-language papers).
</P>
<P>
   By that evening, the small counterattack had begun. Director
Mehta flew in from her home in Toronto to defend the film. Numerous
Indian artists came forward to denounce the attacks. Shabana Azmi,
the older of the film's two stars _ a member of Parliament and
arguably India's most-respected actress _ publicly wore a black arm
band. India's foremost gay-rights activist, Ashok Rao Kawai, asked,
``If they (the Shiv Sena) think (lesbianism) doesn't happen in
Indian society, what do they think is going on in those sculptures
in Khajuraho and Konark?''
</P>
<P>
   Later that week, the film opened in Calcutta _ traditionally
India's most intellectually tolerant city and much less of a
fundamentalist Hindu stronghold. This time, both police and
moviegoers at the Chaplin Theater fought off the Shiv Sena mob and
kept ``Fire'' open. And finally and belatedly, India's Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee _ himself a member of the
Hindu-Nationalist RSS _ condemned the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it soon became clear that repression had won the day. A
goon squad attack on the father of Nandita Das, the younger of the
``Fire'' stars, and on several of the celebrities who had expressed
support of the film, quickly silenced the outrage of the artistic
community. The theater owners in Bombay and Delhi refused to reopen
the picture, even when the Indian supreme court guaranteed
protection. The national censor board announced that it intended to
reassess its approval of ``Fire.''

CRANE EXPECTED TO ABANDON OPPOSITION TO MERGER OF COLTEC AND
GOODRICH 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 - NYT  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.C., Ohio)   By   SHARON R. KING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following the dismissal of Crane Co.'s lawsuit to block Coltec
Industries from merging with B.F. Goodrich, analysts and investors
said Wednesday that they did not expect Crane to pursue a hostile
bid.
</P>
<P>
   In part because such a bid would be more costly, ``most people
viewed this as unlikely to go hostile,'' said Tom Burnett, an
analyst with Merger Insight, a research firm. ``We're expecting
they might appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Crane's lawsuit contended that Coltec, a maker of aircraft
braking systems, broke a 1995 promise to notify Crane of any offers
to buy it when Coltec agreed in November to be acquired by Goodrich
for about $1.6 billion in stock and assuming $610 million of debt.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also sought to void anti-takeover provisions that are
part of the proposed deal so that Crane, which makes aerospace and
industrial products, could present its bid for Coltec, worth about
$1.8 billion, excluding debt.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Barbara S. Jones in White
Plains disagreed with Crane's interpretation of its agreement with
Coltec, ruling that ``Coltec was not required to notify Crane of
B.F. Goodrich's bid.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge was expected to issue a written decision within a few
days, her deputy said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors showed little reaction to Crane's legal defeat as
shares of all three companies fell modestly Wednesday. Shares of
Crane, which is based in Stamford, Conn., slipped 37.5 cents to
$29.50. Those of Coltec, based in Charlotte, N.C., fell 57.42 cents
to $18.92, while those of Goodrich, based in Richfield, Ohio, fell
70.3 cents to $34.92.
</P>
<P>
   Crane said it would wait until the judge issued her written
decision before deciding what to do, but the company also has said
that it is only interested in acquiring Coltec through a
stock-for-stock transaction, known as a pooling of interests.
Generally, companies must be on friendly terms for that type of
acquisition to work.
</P>
<P>
   Accounting for the acquisition as a purchase would be more
expensive. Accounting rules governing those transactions require
that any amount paid in excess of the asset values be written off
over time, causing a reduction in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   An anti-takeover provision, known as a lock-up agreement, that
is part of the Coltec-Goodrich deal makes it prohibitively
expensive for a third party to acquire Coltec.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, who believed that Crane would see immediate benefit
to earnings through the combination of its aerospace anti-skid
devices with Coltec's braking systems, would likely balk if that
meant lowered earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's going to tolerate dilution on this,'' said Wendy
Caplan, a principal at ING Baring Furman Selz who follows Crane.

INDIA AND HOLLYWOOD: FOR HALF A CENTURY, A LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the past 50 years, no two countries have had a stranger
cinematic relationship than India and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since independence, India has _ until very recently _ used
strict quota laws to keep most of Hollywood's products out, while
building its own native industry into a powerhouse, the world's
largest-volume producer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, except for an occasional art film, the United States
has shown no interest in importing any of the thousands of films
India has made in these decades, under the theory they're so inane
and foreign to our sensibilities that even film festivals won't
play them.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, India has happily allowed Hollywood (and other foreign
film) companies to shoot in India, financed by ``frozen'' rupees:
profits of expatriate companies that, under India's strict currency
restrictions, can't be taken out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Since all the big Hollywood studios had frozen rupees to burn,
and since India held such fascination for western audiences (think
of ``Gunga Din'' or ``The Lives of a Bengal Lancer'') and since
shooting in India was relatively easy (half the population speaks
English, after all, and the government is quite helpful), Hollywood
leaped at the offer.
</P>
<P>
   So more foreign films have been shot on location in India than
any other Asian country. Indeed, virtually every aspect of its
diverse geography _ from the Himalayas to the deserts of Rajasthan
to the jungles of Tamil Nadu _ has been immortalized by Hollywood.
The director Mark Robson said it best: ``India is Hollywood's
biggest backlot.''
</P>
<P>
   This vast filmography of shot-in-India films includes B-movies
(``Monsoon''), kids' movies (``Tarzan Goes to India''),
documentaries (Louis Malle's four-hour ``Phantom India''), art
movies (more than a dozen Merchant-Ivory dramas), epic TV
miniseries (``The Jewel in the Crown,'' ``The Far Pavilions'') and
a star vehicle from every major studio.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many of the Hollywood-India star vehicles are not
yet available on video, including Robson's 1963 ``Nine Hours to
Rama,'' the 1953 Tyrone Power epic, ``King of the Khyber Rifles,''
Alan Ladd's 1953 ``Thunder in the East'' and the 1955 Lana
Turner-Richard Burton romantic adventure, ``The Rains of
Ranchipur.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, however, is a rundown on some of the most memorable
filmed-in-India epics that you might find at your local video
store:
</P>
<P>
   ``Elephant Boy'' (1937) _ Robert Flaherty, America's greatest
documentary filmmaker, co-directed (with Zoltan Korda) this
Raj-era, British film version of a Rudyard Kipling story that made
a star out of Sabu, a stable boy discovered while working for the
Maharaja of Mysore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim'' (1950) _ The most authentic of Hollywood's many Kipling
adaptations was this rousing, colorful MGM version of the author's
masterpiece, filmed in numerous remote Indian locations by director
Victor Saville and starring Dean Stockwell and (in one of his most
unusual performances) Errol Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bhowani Junction'' (1956) _ The story _ about the plight of
Anglo-Indians at the time of independence _ clearly got away from
director George Cukor, but the film (shot mostly in Pakistan) is
still an extraordinary, eye-filling epic, and, as the half-caste
heroine, Ava Gardner was never more radiant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Journey to the Lost City'' (1960)/``The River'' (1951) _ Two
India films by two European masters: the first a compilation of two
exotic adventures shot by Germany's Fritz Lang in Rajasthan; the
second Jean Renoir's classic coming-of-age drama about two British
children growing up in Bengal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maya'' (1966) _ John Berry _ the blacklisted, film noir
director who fled America in the '50s _ showed a surprising feel
for the many moods of India in this children's movie about the son
(Jay North) of a hunter (Clint Walker) who teams up with an Indian
boy (Sajid Khan) to deliver a white elephant to a holy city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gandhi'' (1982) _ Few films have captured the sheer scope and
many contradictions of India quite as dramatically as this
still-stunning biography, which features an eerily perfect
performance by Ben Kingsley as India's Great Soul, Mohandas K.
Gandhi. The film won an Oscar for best picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heat and Dust'' (1983) _ The Merchant-Ivory team has made no
less than 17 films in India with blocked rupees (``Bombay Talkie,''
``The Guru,'' etc.) but this adaptation of Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's
novel _ following two parallel stories, 60 years apart _ is the
most exquisitely enigmatic of them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Passage to India'' (1984) _ India-phile David Lean tried for
years to a mount a film about the making of the Taj Mahal, but had
to settle instead for this lavish, mostly successful adaption of
E.M. Forster's novel, shot in and around Bangalore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Deceivers'' (1988) _ Pierce Brosnan plays William Sleeman,
the British officer who stamped out the infamous thuggee cult
(ritual murderers who strangled travelers to appease the goddess
Kali) in this exciting, underrated Nicholas Meyer-directed
historical adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``City of Joy'' (1992) _ Roland Joffe had so many hassles
mounting this evocative film version of Dominique Lapierre's novel
_ about the consciousness-raising of an American doctor in a
Calcutta slum _ that Hollywood producers are likely to be very shy
about venturing into India again for many years.

anything but surprising. Devaluation has been the overwhelming
prediction among economists even after the International Monetary
Fund provided a $41.5 billion credit line several months ago. But
the problem with the bailout is that it allowed Brazil to cling to
an overvalued exchange rate and a policy of relying heavily on
short term loans. That combination, says Jeffrey Sachs of the

response to another dose of emerging market turmoil. Brazil's plan
to effectively devalue its currency initially deflated the
confidence of stock investors in the United States and abroad. But
after a sharp selloff in the first half hour of trading, American
stock prices rebounded steadily throughout the day. By Edward

   BRAZIL-IMPACT (Undated) _ Brazil's surprise devaluation was
anything but surprising. Devaluation has been the overwhelming
prediction among economists even after the International Monetary
Fund provided a $41.5 billion credit line several months ago. But
the problem with the bailout is that it allowed Brazil to cling to
an overvalued exchange rate and a policy of relying heavily on
short term loans. That combination, says Jeffrey Sachs of the
Harvard Institute for International Development, ``is anywhere and
everywhere an invitation for financial chaos.'' By Michael M.
Weinstein.

   EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. _ Randy Moss had to travel about 30 feet to
get from the Vikings' locker room to his sports utility vehicle
Wednesday, yet he still sprinted as if he were running a fly
pattern at the Metrodome. A temperature of minus 4 will cause that
sort of hurried behavior, even to someone as smooth as Moss.
</P>
<P>
   When Moss returned to the warmth of the indoors, he regained his
swagger. The rookie wide receiver sounded cool and looked
confident. So did all of the Vikings. They did not sound arrogant
or look antsy. They simply seemed intent on vanquishing the Atlanta
Falcons in the National Football Conference championship game on
Sunday so they can soar into the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about who wants it more and who's going to be hungry
enough to make it happen,'' said Moss. ``We've got a goal. Just
win.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a recurring theme from the Vikings inside a weight room
that served as a temporary setting for some news conferences. The
Vikings were polite while discussing the Falcons, repeatedly
calling them the best team they have opposed all season. But the
fearsome Vikings, who set a National Football League record by
scoring 556 points in the regular season, surely expect to score on
Atlanta and surely believe their dream season will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond the point of trying to prove anything,'' said
Robert Smith, a running back. ``You lose, you're out. We're not
trying to get any more people on the bandwagon. We're trying to get
to the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss added, ``We got two games, hopefully two games, to show how
explosive we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Additional evidence is unnecessary. Randall Cunningham
resurrected his career with 34 touchdown passes and the highest
rating of any quarterback in football. Moss abused defensive backs
while corralling 17 touchdown passes and is likely to be the rookie
of the year, Chris Carter snatched a dozen touchdown passes and
Smith rushed for 1,187 yards. With an attack that is talented and
unpredictable behind Brian Billick, the clever offensive
coordinator, the Vikings are difficult to defend against.
</P>
<P>
   How would Moss contain himself if he was reincarnated as a
defensive back?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the way to stop me is slowing me down by jacking me in
the mouth,'' said Moss. ``But I think that's hard to do once I get
focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith chuckled and added, ``I'm glad it's not my job to stop
us.''
</P>
<P>
   How relaxed were the Vikings five days before they will compete
for a trip to the Super Bowl? Cunningham looked as if he just
awakened from a nap as he discussed ``the peace inside'' him as he
awaits the biggest game of his career, Carter juked around some
weight machines before his interview and Moss actually said that
Atlanta's Jamal Anderson is his favorite running back in football.
The smooth Moss was in from the cold, on this day and obviously in
this glorious season. &QL;

`LOOT': FROM KIDDING OPERA TO REWRITING IT
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Production notes at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By WILBORN HAMPTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Perhaps the most disturbing thing about the plays of
Joe Orton is that what was first seen as outrageous farce a scant
30 years ago sounds today more like satirical social commentary. If
audiences and critics of the 1960's were shocked by Orton, he knew
what he was doing. ``People think I write fantasy, but I don't,''
Orton is quoted as saying by John Lahr, his biographer. ``Some
things may be exaggerated or distorted, but they're realistic
figures. . . . There's nothing incredible about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Loot,'' which is being revived by the Jean Cocteau
Repertory, Orton mixes a bank robbery with a funeral, pits a
murderous nurse against a fascist Scotland Yard detective and
creates a dazzling comedy that builds to a hilarious ending and
cuts very close to the all-too-human bone.
</P>
<P>
   As the lights come up on the McLeavy sitting room, a coffin
occupies center stage, bearing the mortal remains of Mrs. McLeavy.
As McLeavy waits for the hearse to arrive from the funeral home,
Fay, the nurse who has been attending the deceased, enters wearing
her house slippers and asks the mourning widower, ``Have you
considered a second marriage yet?''
</P>
<P>
   All the rules suddenly are out the window. There will be no
discussion of what Orton called ``teacup things'' here.
</P>
<P>
   As the title indicates, the play is about money and what people
will do to get it. As it turns out, the McLeavys' son, Hal, and his
lover, Dennis, who is also the undertaker, have just knocked over a
bank, and they must find a place to hide the loot before the
arrival of Truscott, the detective who is posing as an official
from the water board. There is the coffin. But what to do with Mrs.
McLeavy? What follows shouldn't happen to a dog.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a curiously hesitant beginning, the Cocteau production,
under Scott Shattuck's direction, hits full stride in the second
act and delivers the laughs in the play's zany denouement. Unlike
classic farce, which requires a buildup of circumstance before the
humor begins to accumulate, an Orton play starts out at a full
guffaw gallop, even with throwaway lines. (When the nurse places an
embroidered sampler on the coffin, she observes: ``The Ten
Commandments. She was a great believer in some of them.'')
</P>
<P>
   If the pace is tentative in the opening scenes, it gets a burst
of energy with the entrance of Truscott, ably played throughout by
Craig Smith, in a deerstalker and chewing on a pipe, like Sherlock
Holmes on speed. Part of the problem may be that some other cast
members are concentrating more on their attempts at English accents
than on their characters, and end up struggling with both.
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Atkins, for example, never seems completely comfortable
as Fay, the nurse who is seven times a widow at 28. Tim Deak's
performance as Hal, the thief who is disadvantaged by being unable
to lie, is hit and miss: funny in some scenes, less so in others.
Charles Parnell is generally on target as Dennis, the oversexed
undertaker, and Harris Berlinsky gives a low-key reading of
McLeavy.

VENICE HOPES A WAVE-EATING BOAT CAN SAVE CANALS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENICE, Italy _ A small, sleek 22-foot powerboat took a maiden
voyage Wednesday through the choppy waters of the Grand Canal and
barely left a wake. The boat, called Mangia Onda (Wave Eater), is
an American invention that could alter the sinking status quo of
Venice _ a boat designed to reduce the size of waves that are badly
eroding the foundations along Venice's ancient canals.
</P>
<P>
   In an imperiled city that is almost as famous for civic
indecision as it is for its shimmering beauty, innovations are not
always welcome. In Venice, the question is rarely, will it work?
Rather, Venetians wonder whether their city's tangled skein of
vested interests, political infighting and public skepticism will
let anything happen.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a decade of scrutiny and debate, Venice last
month suspended the colossal $2.6 billion Moses project, a flexible
seawall with a series of flap gates that would stretch along the
lagoon and block high tides from flooding the city.
</P>
<P>
   Saving Venice was put off to another day. Meanwhile, the city's
public transport officials and the U.S. design team have convinced
themselves that in the Mangia Onda they have found a far more
modest way to at least curtail some of the damage caused by
churning waters. All they have to do now is convince everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds like another hole in the water,'' grumbled Pietro, a
water taxi driver who declined to give his last name but did not
hesitate to show his scorn for newfangled notions. ``The only way
to keep a motorboat from making waves is to keep it tied to the
dock.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mangia Onda is the brainchild of Charles W. Robinson, 79, a
wealthy former iron ore magnate and deputy secretary of state under
Henry A. Kissinger, who counts boat design and Venice, where he
owns a palazzo, among his avocations.
</P>
<P>
   The wave-eating idea sprang up inadvertently in 1988, when
Robinson was helping the St. Francis Yacht Club of San Francisco
increase its sailboat's speed in qualifying for the America's Cup.
That design proved unwieldy for racing.
</P>
<P>
   But Robinson discovered that by funneling the bow wave through
catamaran-like wings attached to both sides of a central hull, one
could reduce the boat's waves. The hull design also increased the
boat's efficiency, allowing faster speed _ and less pollution and
noise _ with smaller engines.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, intent on using some of the technology to build a
faster racing boat of his own design, the Red Hornet, put aside the
wave-eating proposal until a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept thinking about the problem of waves on the Venice
canals and how they damage the foundations,'' he said. ``Then we
got to work.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of William Burns, a naval architect, and William
Engle, a marine designer, he designed a prototype for Venice and
offered it to the city's transport authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get someone in our offices everyday who claims to have a
miracle solution to our problems,'' said Alessandro Cassone, the
projects director of the Venice Transport Authority. ``It's not
that Chuck's idea was so revolutionary, it's that it was worked out
practically and flexibly. We intuited instantly that this was the
real thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It also didn't hurt that Robinson spent about $1 million of his
own money on the design. He also donated his prototype to the Save
Venice Foundation, a U.S.-based charity, which will lend it to the
transport authority for 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   The current model is the size of a 10-passenger water taxi,
which in Venice are run by private individuals or cooperatives. The
Venice Transport Authority is mainly interested in replacing its
fleet of vaporetti, the 150-person passenger boats that cruise the
canals like buses.
</P>
<P>
   Venice asked Robinson to design a 73-foot Mangia Onda that could
hold up to 150 passengers. Robinson will own a design license, but
to ease acceptance locally Venetian boat-builders will construct
the boats.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Mangia Onda is making big waves of another sort.
Venice has laws to protect traditional craftsmanship and local
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the transport authority, Renzo Brunetti, looked
pleased as he rode in the fiberglass Mangia Onda, but fretted that
local wood builders would complain. ``Maybe we can add some wood to
the Mangia Onda,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Brunetti's transport authority colleagues rolled his eyes
and shrugged. ``In Venice, everything is political,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the mayor, Massimo Cacciari, seemed worn down by
certain city traditions. ``This Mangia Onda is what we need, but to
really save this city, we have to force boatmen to obey the speed
limits, we have to reduce the number of boats, and we cannot go on
having seven different government agencies responsible for
controlling the lagoon _ it's an infernal mess.''
</P>
<P>
   He sighed wearily. ``It's a lot easier to design a new boat than
it is to change people's mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mangia Onda could garner the political support of Venice's
405 gondoliers, who have long been at war with the private
speedboats, water taxis and vaporetti that are damaging the canals
_ and the gondola business.
</P>
<P>
   But even they voice doubts. ``Of course we'd be happy if the
boat really does eat waves,'' said Mauro Trevenzoli, vice president
of the association of gondoliers. ``But first let's make sure it's
not some design to eat money.''

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Challenged by adversaries at home and
nervous investors abroad, the Brazilian government devalued the
nation's currency on Wednesday, allowing it to fall by more than 8
percent and triggering turbulence in financial markets around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The action came after the surprise resignation of the president
of the central bank and a week of precipitous declines in the stock
market. In the first 12 minutes of trading on Wednesday, the key
Bovespa index dropped a stunning 10 percent, setting off an
automatic shutdown of trading. After the market reopened, shares
recovered somewhat, ending the day down 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty here revived investors' fears that Brazil's
renewed difficulties could create problems in neighboring
countries, undermine the International Monetary Fund's rescue
efforts or even lead to currency realignments throughout the
developing world. Markets in Europe and elsewhere in Latin America
declined by as much as 8 percent, and bonds were up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question now is one of the credibility of the
government,'' said Edmar Bacha, a former government official, who
is now president of BBA Securities. ``The first impression of the
markets is: `Here we go; it's Mexico in December 1994 all over
again,'' alluding to the currency crisis there. He added, ``They've
opened the door, and there will be a flood.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to restore consumer confidence and investor credibility,
Francisco Lopes, the newly designated president of the central
bank, opted for what Paulo Mallman, chief economist of Bic Banco in
Sao Paulo, called ``high-risk surgery.'' Since 1994, one key to
Brazil's economic growth and reduced inflation rate has been a
rigidly controlled and carefully calibrated exchange policy for the
nation's currency, the real. That will now be discarded in favor of
a more flexible approach, but one that is less predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central bank should not be concerned with eventual
corrections in the real exchange rate,'' Lopes said on Wednesday at
a news conference in Brasilia. ``We believe that the real rate of
exchange is a phenomenon that should be determined by market forces
and should not be an objective of the central bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopes ruled out a maxi-devaluation, like the one in Mexico,
however, saying that would merely generate greater inflation,
traditionally the principal bugaboo of the Brazilian economy. He
estimated that Brazil had $45 billion in reserves and said the
government was willing to use both that money and interest rate
policy to defend what it considered a reasonable exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   The new central bank head predicted that ``the maximum nominal
devaluation this year should remain between 12 and 15 percent.''
That would be approximately double the target of roughly 7 percent
that Cardoso and his team set _ and largely adhered to _ during
their first term in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an atmosphere of sparks in the air, of anxiety,
speculation and suspicion of the government's ability to make good
its commitments to the IMF,'' Mallman said. ``People believed in
the stability of the exchange policy, and that confidence has now
been broken a bit. Everything that is going on leaves people
feeling less secure and more apprehensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about Congress' unwillingness to approve legislation
that Cardoso says is essential to reduce the huge government
deficit have also contributed to uneasiness here.
</P>
<P>
   In a boost to Cardoso, legislators approved four important
measures on Wednesday afternoon that would, among other things,
impose new taxes on financial transfers and corporate profits. The
measures are expected to generate more than $3 billion in revenues
and make up for shortfalls in other areas where the government has
been unable to carry out changes because of opposition resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the Russian currency and economy in
August, foreign investors and government officials have expressed
concern that Brazil could also implode and drag the rest of Latin
America down with it, especially its partners in the Mercosur
trading bloc, notably Argentina. Brazil, the eighth-largest economy
in the world, is the locomotive for Latin America's economies,
which now absorb one-fifth of U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton said he and members of his
economic team were closely monitoring the crisis in Brazil and had
been in contact with Brazilian authorities, the International
Monetary Fund and U.S. allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a strong interest in seeing Brazil, with whom we have
worked on so many important things around the world, carry forward
with its economic reform plan and succeed, and we certainly hope
that they will,'' Clinton told reporters at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso, who began his second four-year term on Jan. 1,
dismissed as unreasonable any fears that Brazil could default on
the commitments it has made. ``The government has the means to meet
all of its obligations,'' he said. ``The government will always
honor all its internal and external obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Cardoso described the latest measures as
a ``technical modification'' rather than a fundamental shift of
policy. ``This does not signify a change of direction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that explanation fell on deaf ears. Though banks here
continued to sell dollars at the very peak of the new trading band
established by the government, 1.32 reals to the dollar, most
currency exchanges were refusing to sell dollars at any price,
expecting that the real will weaken even further in days to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly not a good sign that the real immediately went
to the ceiling of the new band,'' said Carlos Geraldo Langoni, a
former president of the central bank. ``This is an attempt to save
the existing exchange rate regimen, but its success depends on the
evaluation the market makes, so we will have to wait 15 days or
so.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The crisis began late last week, when Itamar Franco, the newly
sworn-in governor of Brazil's second most populous state, Minas
Gerais, announced a 90-day moratorium on repayment of the $13.5
billion in debt his state owes to the national government. The
action generated fears here and overseas that other states might
follow suit and that Cardoso would be unable to comply with the
terms of the $41.5 billion rescue package the International
Monetary Fund announced in November.
</P>
<P>
   The Sao Paulo stock market immediately took a drastic plunge,
and in less than a week it has lost nearly a quarter of its value.
Looking for a safe haven abroad, investors on Tuesday sent $1.2
billion out of the country, thereby rekindling fears of a massive
drain on reserves that had been calmed in November by the IMF
package, after Brazil lost nearly half the $75 billion it had in
reserves before the Russian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLOS)
</P>
<P>
   While events of the past week have plunged stock brokers,
bankers and economists into a virtual state of panic, ordinary
Brazilians seem less alarmed by the situation. It is the middle of
summer here, and Rio's beaches and streets were crowded on
Wednesday with vacationers and shoppers looking ahead to next
month's Carnival celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are being laid off left and right, and prices are sky
high,'' said Carlos Eduardo Braga Cavalcanti, while sipping a beer
at beachfront snack stand Wednesday night. ``We're going to have
all year to think about those problems, because they're not going
to disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso, who cut short his own beach vacation to return to the
capital, urged Brazilians to remain calm and said his government
would stay the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential Brazil continue with changes in our fiscal
regime,'' he said, adding that reform measures already approved by
Congress have led to ``a marked advance'' in Brazil's long-term
economic health.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso and his advisers hope that the changes in exchange-rate
policy will, if successful, allow them to reduce interest rates,
which reached nearly 50 percent last year. Those punishingly high
rates are perhaps the principal reason that the Brazilian economy
has been pushed into a recession, which is expected to continue at
least into the middle of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's remarks and policies immediately came under
fire from an opposition that has been emboldened by Franco's
challenge to the authority of the federal government. The leader of
one opposition party, Leonel Brizola, praised Franco as ``a symbol
of national resistance'' and urged Cardoso to step down, while the
president's principal opponent in last fall's election, Luis Inacio
da Silva of the Worker's Party, said the problem went far beyond
Franco's act of defiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreign investors have never heard of Minas Gerais,'' he said.
``Their problem is a lack of confidence in the direction of the
Brazilian economy. The whole economic team has to be changed,
because Francisco Lopes is not going to change anything in the
current orientation of the central bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopes, one of the architects of economic policy for the past
five years, replaces Gustavo Franco, who will remain in the
government as a member of Cardoso's council of economic advisers.
Economists and other analysts here said that Franco stepped down
because he preferred a more rigid exchange policy as a means to
enforce economic discipline but that on many other issues the two
men are in basic agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lopes is as conservative and orthodox as Franco is and has
better personal relationships within the government and with
Congress,'' said Bacha, president of BBA Securities. ``Once the
market sees this, things will improve.''

should be inserted before the numbers) 
(See also: IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-LEGAL, IMPEACH-CLINTON,

 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Knock yourself loose calling all over the world to
produce a column about the Syrian dictator Hafez al-Assad sending
hoodlums to trash our Damascus embassy, and nobody cares.
</P>
<P>
   But suck your thumb, stare at the wall and wonder in print what
holds Bill Clinton's popularity up despite a year running Shame
Inc., and _ hoo-hah! _ more mail comes pouring in than from any of
your columns in years.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, I now have in hand a survey conducted on the same
scientific lines as the memorable Literary Digest poll of 1936,
which forecast Alf Landon's victory over FDR.
</P>
<P>
   Finding 1. (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Clinton loyalists see the media
as elitist hounds and the man being impeached as populist fox. (END
ITALICS HERE)``What the political class and media elite don't
understand is . . . he likes us so much better than he likes all of
you,'' notes a Floridian. ``In fact, he can't stand you and neither
can we.''
</P>
<P>
   2. (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Loyalists find his failings to be their
failings.(END ITALICS HERE) ``I prefer human leaders,'' writes an
Indiana woman, ``and Bill Clinton seems to have a sin for each of
us to identify with.'' (She adds: ``We like people who tell us we
are doing good. When was the last time any right-wing ideologue
said we were doing good?'') ``He is being guided,'' a preacher
notes, ``. . . being used to reveal human frailties which have been
a part of who we are for eons.''
</P>
<P>
   3. (END ITALICS HERE) He is grudgingly admired for his
Houdini-class escapes.(END ITALICS HERE) ``Our lives replay high
school,'' says a New York City man. ``Bill Clinton is the popular
kid _ athletic, socially adroit, charismatic _ who runs afoul of
the rules. Yet he somehow manages to escape real punishment or
taint. Worse, he makes the winning touchdown, delivers the class
address and scores with all the babes. Meanwhile, the dutiful,
diligent geeks (Republicans) just can't understand the unfairness
of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   4. (END ITALICS HERE) Some loyalists discern a liberating
message in his example.(END ITALICS HERE) ``Bill Clinton has
challenged two of our hypocrisies,'' writes a Connecticut woman.
``We have had to admit that sexual activity is not the crime we
thought it was, and that, on occasion, we condone dishonesty. . . .
He has reminded us that sexual activity is . . . a necessity for
our good moods, our creative energies and even for our feelings of
generosity toward others.''
</P>
<P>
   5. (END ITALICS HERE) Impeachment is akin to combat, say Clinton
die-hards, and sides must be taken. (END ITALICS HERE) ``I feel
I've been put in the situation of someone who must choose between
two sides in a horrible civil war,'' writes a Florida man. ``One in
which both sides are routinely committing atrocities. I can live
with the aftermath of Clinton's conduct. I cannot live with
everyone suddenly having to pass the muster of the self-appointed
guardians of the national morality.''
</P>
<P>
   6. (END ITALICS HERE) In this culture clash, loyalists see
Clinton as their persecuted champion. (END ITALICS HERE)
``Fundamental belief systems, analogous to those in the Civil War,
are in question,'' holds a Connecticut Ph.D. ``The equality, or
dominance, of a race or gender underlies the apparent conflict
between political parties . . . about familiar white male values in
contrast to more democratic but scarier ones.''
</P>
<P>
   7. (END ITALICS HERE) Loyalty to Clinton in this contest is
intensified by anger at his pursuers. (END ITALICS HERE)``It's fun
watching you right-wing, obsessed nut-job freaks twist in the
wind,'' fulminates a New Yorker. ``This is war.'' A more temperate
Californian notes: ``The phenomenal mean-spiritedness of so many of
Mr. Clinton's critics elevates him by comparison. People grow weary
of negaholics.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the central point about the source of Clinton support in
the mail drawn by my wonderment. ``How can you not understand the
concept of `the enemy of my enemy is my friend'? The critics of the
president scare many of us out here in the hinterlands,'' reports a
Wisconsin man. ``They are moralists, they have no sense of human
frailties, and they frankly aren't very likable. If they kept their
mouths shut and let moderate people present the issues, the
president's support might diminish significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   There we have a snapshot of some of the sources of this
president's remarkably solid support.
</P>
<P>
   The loyalists' Clinton: not a reckless predator of women but a
victim of an elitist-moralist plot; not a breaker of solemn oaths
but a breaker of moral chains; not a cornered con man but a hero to
all who feel hunted. Is this the new, much different Silent
Majority?

   QUAKE-PEOPLE (Los Angeles) _ After the jolts from the Northridge
Earthquake tossed an armoir onto Susie Riley and broke her neck,
doctors stared at the ground and dodged questions when she asked if
she would walk again. Like so many victims of the 1994 temblor, the
Valencia woman spent months in the hospital fighting to reclaim her
life. And like many, her story is one of redemption and resiliance.

 &HT;    Profile illuminates Sun's rise to technology's big leagues
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Technology topics have dominated the covers of
business magazines in the past year and, based on the latest ones,
there's little reason to think this fascination will change in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Business Week (Jan. 18) profiles Sun Microsystems,
which among other things plays a leading role in the government's
case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   By outpacing its rivals, the magazine says, ``Sun has finally
reached the big leagues of the computer industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes (Jan. 25), meanwhile, tells how Intel Chairman Andrew
Grove converted the advice of a Harvard Business School professor,
Clayton Christensen, into the sales strategy that captured 35
percent of the low-cost computer market.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen's message was that a small company with a good
product can use a ``stealth attack'' to take business away from the
big guys.
</P>
<P>
   A turn of the cycle
</P>
<P>
   Cyclical stocks, which are sensitive to the economy, aren't
supposed to perform well when the economy slows, as it is doing
now.
</P>
<P>
   But Individual Investor (February) points out that not all
cyclicals are alike _ which is a plus for bargain-hunting
investors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the well-known ``deep cyclicals'' that make heavy
equipment and industrial commodities such as aluminum _ and also
depend on improving business _ there are ``soft cyclicals.''
</P>
<P>
   Among them are ``non-industrial'' stocks such as airlines,
hotels and retailers that serve consumers who have already taken
care of essentials, and have extra cash for travel, luxury and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Moms manage the money
</P>
<P>
   It may still be a man's world in many respects, but women hold
the purse strings, Working Mother (February) reports.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the nearly 1,000 working mothers questioned by the
magazine said they manage the finances and spending for their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, 42 percent rarely, or never, fight with their
spouses about money, which the magazine attributes to the
``management and diplomatic skills'' of working moms.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Real estate investment trusts had a bad year in 1998, with
total returns falling more than 15 percent. But Georgia-based REITs
outperformed the industry by declining only 2.8 percent on average,
reflecting the region's economic strength, Georgia Trend (January)
reports.
</P>
<P>
   _ The attention lavished on the new European currency, the euro,
has obscured an even bigger currency development, says The
Economist (Jan. 15) _ namely the dollar's decline against the
Japanese yen, which, if it continues, ``could have serious
consequences for the world economy.

 &HT;    Georgia companies try to hang on as nation restructures
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia companies have a lot at stake as Brazil tries
to restructure its economy.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth, Coca-Cola, Southern Co. and AGCO Corp. are among the
companies that have significant investments or operations in what
has been considered South America's most promising economy. Delta
Air Lines has launched business-oriented nonstop daily service to
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is the No. 7 destination for Georgia exports, and metro
Atlanta business boosters increasingly have been touting that
nation as a prime potential market, given the economic uncertainty
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Trade delegations have been traveling back and forth for years.
Georgia Tech this week is hosting 45 students from the executive
M.B.A. program at the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia State University economist Donald Ratajczak said
Wednesday's crisis will certainly cut costs for U.S. companies
doing business in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said the dollar value of U.S. investments there is
depreciating, and companies are likely to wait and reassess the
depths of the Brazilian recession before making any new moves.
``Nobody is going to do anything until it stabilizes,'' Ratajczak
said.
</P>
<P>
   David Orr, an economist at North Carolina-based First Union
Corp., said the crisis ``could have a $40 billion economic impact
on U.S. corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's huge and it could slow U.S. profit growth substantially
in 1999,'' Orr said.
</P>
<P>
   Ratajczak said the Brazilian economy will now shrink by between
4 and 5 percent this year, instead of the 1 percent that had been
widely forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a recession of that magnitiude, why would you
want to invest?'' Ratajczak asked. ``The issue is not Southern
Company and Delta. It's Chase Manhattan Bank and Bank of America,''
he said. ``These guys could lose so much money that they stop
making loans in the U.S. Then we've got real problems.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not appear Georgia companies were taking precipitous
actions in response to Wednesday's events:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``We are monitoring the situation in Brazil as we do on an
ongoing basis with economies around the world,'' said Delta
spokesman John Kennedy. Last year, the Atlanta-based carrier
launched nonstop service between Atlanta and Brazil. Daily flights
go to Sao Paulo, then Rio de Janeiro and return to Hartsfield
International Airport. Most of the passengers are executives.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kevin Doyle, a spokesman for BellSouth, said the company sees
no change of strategic direction for its Brazilian operations.
``Our business in Brazil was a long-term investment and that is
what it remains,'' Doyle said. The company is providing wireless
service in two regions of Brazil, paying well over $1 billion for
the two licenses and spending hundreds of millions more to build
the networks needed.
</P>
<P>
   A faltering economy could threaten the business, at least in the
short run. But Brazil also has a sizeable segment of affluent
residents that are BellSouth's prime custromers. A recession could
even make it cheaper for BellSouth to expand its investments there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Brazil is the sixth-largest market for Atlanta-based
Coca-Cola, providing 3.9 percent of its profit in 1997, according
to Sanford C. Bernstein analyst William Pecoriello. Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter analyst Andrew Conway estimated Coke sales dropped 3
percent in Brazil in the fourth quarter and could continue to slide
in 1999. Coca-Cola declined comment. But Embotelladora Andina SA,
Chile's largest Coca-Cola bottler, said Wednesday that sales slowed
in the last three months of 1998, in part because of a 12 percent
to 13 percent decline in shipments to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last January, Southern Co. acquired a 3.6 percent stake in
Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais for $247 million. The utility,
known as Cemig, has 4.3 million customers, more than all of
Southern's U.S. utilities combined.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pershing, senior vice president at Southern Energy Inc.,
the company's international unit, said Southern had anticipated a
``creeping devaluation'' of Brazil's currency during 1999 and had
already factored that into its economic projections. ``This made it
happen faster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Southern spokesman Chuck Griffin said Brazil ``is still the key
country we're looking at in South America'' for more investments.
</P>
<P>
   Southern said last month it would shift its strategic focus in
the region to Brazil. The company plans Tuesday to announce a
``significant'' onetime charge to 1998 earnings to reflect a
decline in value of $400 million investments in Chilean and
Argentine utilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ AGCO, the Duluth-based farm equipment manufacturer, has also
shifted operations from Argentina to Brazil. The company, which is
cutting jobs and expenses in response to a global economic slump,
is the leading tractor supplier in both countries. AGCO announced
last month it would sell an Argentine plant and consolidate
operations in Brazil.

 &HT;    Acquisition of Ascend a key move for Lucent
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When giant AT&AMP;T was dismembered in 1984, the big news was the
freedom for the regional phone companies to grow independently.
Tucked away within Ma Bell were the huge manufacturing operation
and Bell labs, the think tank that came up with product ideas and
technology improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion in telephone technology, now augmented by the boom
in Internet communication, threatened to bypass the product
development forces tucked within the vastness of AT&AMP;T. Limited to
satisfying the needs and demands of AT&AMP;T, that manufacturing would
have a hard time keeping up with the fast-changing
telecommunications market, let alone lead it.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason it made sense for AT&AMP;T to spin off the
production machine, now known as Lucent Technologies, freeing it to
grow with the vast telecommunications market and meet a wider
variety of needs.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, based in Murray Hill, N.J., took a big step in its
growth strategy Wednesday with its $19.7 billion purchase of Ascend
Communications Inc. of Alameda, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The move is expected to make Lucent a more formidable player in
telecommunications technology.
</P>
<P>
   The spinoff of Lucent, completed two years ago, has seen it grow
rapidly and become a darling of Wall Street. But what Lucent has
discovered is that to keep turning out new products and services
fast enough to meet needs, it had to buy into new talent, skills
and expertise.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why Lucent made the deal. In one motion, it became
an even bigger and more vibrant player in new technologies.
Moreover, it might even alter the tide of technological change
occurring around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Rich McGinn, chairman and chief executive of Lucent, said the
deal gives Lucent a ``broader and more powerful portfolio'' on
developing the next generation of networks for delivering phone
calls, handling data transfer and providing video services.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts expressed general approval of the
acquisition but with reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucent needs the gear and the credibility in the market that
Ascend can bring them,'' said Bob Bellman, analyst with Brooktrail
Research in Natick, Mass. ``But I don't know if they can pull it
off. Lucent is such a big company; it may just eat up Ascend and
not produce very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, whose local hub is in Norcross, employs more than 6,800
people and leads the world in the manufacture of fiber-optic cable.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent has gotten more business from the regional telephone
companies in recent years, freed from AT&AMP;T, which the regional
companies saw as a looming competitor in the local phone business.
Now they can place orders and big deals to Lucent without feeling
that they strengthen AT&AMP;T and undermine themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend is only 10 years old and a major player in the production
of ATM equipment and services. Lucent has been one of its important
customers. Now Lucent and Ascend can grow together, merging their
talents, facilities and market savvy to produce new products in
several areas.
</P>
<P>
   On its own, Lucent has had success in producing such items as
digital processing chips that enhance personal computers to do such
things as videoconferencing. It has also put together systems for
unified messaging, which integrates e-mail, telefaxing and voice
mail.
</P>
<P>
   Together with Ascend, a bigger and better Lucent can be expected
to push hard to be a leader in the new technology of bringing
greater bandwidth to personal computers. Achieving greater
bandwidth is like replacing a 1-inch water line with a 4-inch line.
</P>
<P>
   It creates a faster and bigger volume flow. In the computer,
increased bandwidth enables PC to load information faster and make
greater use of services such as video.
</P>
<P>
   Much anticipated are advancements in DSL and even faster
technology to create large bandwidth networks to deliver larger and
faster streams of data to personal computers through telephone
lines. This is an objective of many players in telecommunications
and a competition for which Lucent is now better armed.
</P>
<P>
   In this broader area, a bigger and enhanced Lucent can count on
the talents of Bell Labs, one of the country's most successful
enterprises in research and development.
</P>
<P>
   The new Lucent is now in the middle of the competition between
cable and telephone technology, with the $200 billion telephone
industry struggling hard to keep up with the cable industry in
providing better service to homes and offices.

 &HT;    Father, son developer team accused of sexual harassment
 &HT;    By Sallye Salter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Architect-developer John C. Portman Jr., and his son,
Jeffrey Portman, are accused of sexual harassment in two federal
lawsuits filed by former employees. Their firm, AMC Inc., which
operates the downtown trade mart complex, is also named in the
suits by the former women executives. The alleged harassment, much
of it in public, ``reflected a corporate culture of sexual
harassment of female employees at AMC,'' according to the court
filings.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are Stacey Schoppenhorst, a former buyer services
director, and Masa Kisner, who AMC employed as director of buyer
relations and as director of international development. The women
couldn't be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The suits, filed at different times last year in U.S. District
Court in Atlanta, don't ask for a specific amount of damages.
Schoppenhorst filed suit against AMC and both Portmans. Kisner's
suit names Jeffrey Portman and AMC.
</P>
<P>
   Christina S. Meador, attorney for the Portmans and AMC, denied
the allegations Wednesday. ``Discovery has barely started. We
intend to defend vigorously, and I think in the long run that we
will be vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Robert Marx, who represents both plaintiffs, said
Wednesday, ``We are litigating aggressively. We will be taking
depositions of current or former employees that will bear out the
allegations of the complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the filing of the cases, sexual harassment charges were
filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The EEOC
gave both plaintiffs right-to-sue letters, according to Marx. Such
a letter is required as a prerequisite before filing a federal
sexual harassment lawsuit, but it doesn't constitute an endorsement
of complaints.
</P>
<P>
   In court filings, the Portmans contended that some allegations
by Schoppenhorst are barred by a statute of limitations on
complaints to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents filed recently indicated a settlement conference
was held last week in the Schoppenhorst case, and stated that
settlement is a possibility after the discovery process.
</P>
<P>
   Schoppenhorst, who was hired in August 1997, alleged that at a
trade show she was required to attend prior to her employment,
Jeffrey Portman, AMC's executive vice president of sales and
marketing, ``rubbed his hand against'' her breast. From that time
until March 1998, the suit said, ``John Portman and Jeffrey Portman
sexually harassed Ms. Schoppenhorst on a frequent basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The harassment included, the suit said, ``unwelcome remarks''
about Schoppenhorst's appearance and inquiries about her
relationship with her husband, Michael Schoppenhorst, then AMC's
director of trade shows. Michael Schoppenhorst is still employee by
AMC. She was fired in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also alleges that Schoppenhorst was subject to
``repeated physical assaults.'' For example, the suit alleged that
at a trade show in January 1998, John Portman, AMC's chairman and
chief executive, grabbed Schoppenhorst and ``forcefully'' gave her
an open-mouthed kiss in the presence of her husband. ``On numerous
other occasions'' and ``on a regular basis'' Portman ``hugged and
kissed'' her, the suit alleged.
</P>
<P>
   In his response to the suit, Jeffrey Portman said ``certain
conduct and actions were encouraged by and consented to'' by
Schoppenhorst.
</P>
<P>
   Schoppenhorst's suit alleged she was fired after complaining to
AMC's human resource manager and the company's counsel. AMC
responded in court filings that Schoppenhorst was fired for ``lying
to her supervisor and for her history of poor performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit by Kisner, who was hired by AMC in June 1995, alleged
that between May and December 1997, Jeffrey Portman sexually
harassed Kisner ``on a frequent basis'' through inquiries about her
personal life, allusions to his sexual activities and explicit
sexual remarks.
</P>
<P>
   During a business trip to Tokyo, he ``physically assaulted''
Kisner, ``tore her stockings,'' resulting in her having to change
before she could attend a meeting, the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Portman denied any of his actions ``constituted sexual
harassment or improper conduct'' and contended ``such conduct or
actions were encouraged by and consented to'' by Kisner, according
to court filings.
</P>
<P>
   Kisner said that the company retaliated to her complaints by
making false statements that she had credit problems. She resigned
in February 1998.

LAWSUIT SEEKS $1 BILLION IN DAMAGES FROM COMPANIES OVER OPERATION
OF SWEATSHOPS
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Previously budgeted as LABOR-RICO) 
 (sw) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Apparel workers and human rights groups on Wednesday
filed the biggest legal challenge ever against sweatshops on
American soil, accusing Tommy Hilfiger, Sears, Wal-Mart and other
prominent companies of conspiring to place thousands of workers in
involuntary servitude and otherwise mistreat them to hold down
production costs.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action litigation asserts that 18 well-known American
retailers and apparel companies engaged in a racketeering
conspriracy with factory owners in the Northern Marianas Islands,
an American commonwealth near the Philippines, to deprive the
15,000 apparel workers there of basic rights.
</P>
<P>
   The action, actually three related lawsuits, seeks more than $1
billion in damages and is based on work by private investigators,
testimony from apparel workers and reports from the U.S.
Departments of Labor and Interior, which have enforcement powers in
the islands.
</P>
<P>
   It is the most sweeping lawsuit against sweatshops, seeking the
largest amount of money and involving a potential class of 50,000
workers and former workers and an unusually large number of
defendants. Together, the lawsuits describe a grim picture in the
Marianas: the workers, predominantly young women from China, the
Philippines, Bangladesh and Thailand, often must work 12 hours a
day, seven days a week _ and sometimes for free if they fall behind
on their quotas.
</P>
<P>
   These workers, the lawsuits assert, often live seven to a room
in dreary barracks that are surrounded by inward-facing barbed
wire. The lawsuits state that some companies, eager to make sure
that workers remain productive, have forced pregnant workers to
have abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Many workers in China pay $2,000 to $7,000 to recruiters who
boast about ideal conditions in the Marianas, the suit contends,
but when they arrive they find factories where foremen often limit
the number of bathroom breaks and exits are sometimes locked,
creating dangers in case of fire. Frequently, workers who complain
are dismissed or deported.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, the apparel industry in Saipan, the
largest island in the Marianas, has boomed as Chinese entrepreneurs
built factories to benefit not just from the right to ship goods to
the United States without duties or quotas, but also from cheap
labor. The minimum wage in the Marianas is $3.05, far lower than
the $5.15 federal minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saipan is America's worst sweatshop,''Albert Meyerhoff, one of
the lead lawyers, said on Wednesday at a Manhattan news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Several industry officials denied that apparel makers conspired
to deny workers their rights. These officials said that apparel
makers have strained to improve working conditions in recent years
and have often stopped doing business with factories that break the
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The islands are not the draconian slave camp that the big-time
law firm instigators apparently claim they are,''said Jack
Abramoff, a Washington lobbyist who has long represented the
Marianas.
</P>
<P>
   Apparel industry experts said the lawsuits were a public
relations blow to an industry eager to shed its sweatshop-tinged
image. In the lawsuits, prestigious companies like Tommy Hilfiger,
The Gap, Nordstrom, J. Crew and The Limited have for the first time
been named in a civil racketeering lawsuit that essentially accuses
them of conspiring to prey on workers and place them in peonage.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits are different in scope from previous anti-sweatshop
litigation _usually small-scale actions seeking tens of thousands
of dollars in back pay. The new litigation involves a major law
firm experienced in class-action litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Meyerhoff's firm, Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &AMP; Lerach of Los
Angeles, recently negotiated a $1.2 billion settlement with Swiss
banks to reimburse Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   More than $1 billion in apparel is shipped each year from the
Marianas to the United States, and by having production done there,
apparel companies save more than $200 million in duties.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are non-union apparel workers in Saipan, human
rights groups, including Global Exchange and Sweatshop Watch, and
the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, which
is eager to protect American jobs from unfair competition, although
the driving force behind the lawsuit is a group of law firms.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for several defendants said on Wednesday that they had
not yet seen the lawsuits. In a statement, The Gap Inc. said it ``
does not tolerate this type of conduct in the factories where we do
business.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, said
it does not do business with manufacturers in Saipan and has a
``zero-tolerance position with regard to illegal or unethical
working conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Sears, J. Crew and The Limited declined comment.
Officials with Tommy Hilfiger and Nordstrom said that they have
strict fair labor policies.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lawsuits, filed in Federal District Court in Los
Angeles, asserts that the factories, apparel companies and
retailers violated the Racketeering Influence Corrupt Organization
Act and also violated international human rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   A second lawsuit was filed in state court in San Francisco and
charges that the companies engaged in unfair business practices and
misleading advertising by not adhering to their codes of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The third lawsuit was filed in Federal District Court in the
Marianas and charges violations of wage and hours law and of the
Marianas local laws.
</P>
<P>
   To win the conspiracy lawsuit, the lawyers must prove that the
defendants associated in a criminal enterprise that engaged in a
pattern of illegal acts like involuntary servitude and theft of
services. The plaintiffs must also show that the defendants
participated in or aided the conspiracy or received substantial
benefits from it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For women with a high risk of breast cancer, a study being
published Thursday offers hope, but at a cruel price: Removing both
breasts while they are still healthy reduces the risk of getting
breast cancer by 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings, from a study of 639 women who had their
breasts removed from 1960 to 1993, are widely regarded as the most
reliable information to date on the long-term effectiveness of the
operation. The women in the study were considered high risk because
of a strong family history of breast cancer or a personal history
of breast lumps needing biopsies. Tests developed in the 1990s to
detect genetic mutations also provide an indication of women who
may be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons had been performing the breast removal procedure, known
as bilateral prophylactic mastectomy on such women, since the
1960s, assuming that it would reduce a woman's cancer risk. But
they did not know whether it really did, or by how much.
</P>
<P>
   One way that high-risk women can try to protect themselves is by
having regular mammograms and breast examinations in hopes of
detecting the disease early enough to cure it with surgery,
chemotherapy and radiation. The only other way that high-risk women
can protect themselves against breast cancer is by taking the drug
tamoxifen, which in a large study last year was shown to reduce the
risk of the disease by about 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But women are supposed to take the drug for only five years, and
it is not known how long the benefit lasts once they stop. In
addition, tamoxifen may cause blood clots or uterine cancer in some
women, and although it reduces the risk of breast cancer, studies
have not shown that it lowers the death rate from the disease, as
mastectomy does.
</P>
<P>
   The new study of the surgery, by researchers at the Mayo Clinic
in Rochester, Minn., is being published Thursday in the New England
Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is a very important paper,'' said Dr. Patrick Borgen,
chief of breast surgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
in New York, who was not involved in the study. ``It's the first
credible calculation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Borgen and other cancer experts, including the authors of
the paper, cautioned that the findings should not be used to
pressure women into having their breasts removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study doesn't mean we should sell the surgery to more
women,'' Borgen said. ``But women who are considering it now have a
hard-core fact to use as they're making their calculation.''
</P>
<P>
   The data only reflect rates of illness and death for the
participants as a group. Individual women involved in the study,
and others who have undergone the procedure, have no way of knowing
whether it spared them from cancer that might have killed them, or
cost them their breasts to protect them from a disease they would
never have contracted.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lynn Hartmann, a medical oncologist who directed the study
of breast removal, said, ``This report is not meant as a universal
recommendation for this procedure. It's meant to provide data for a
tough and controversial area. I think that to date only a minority
of high-risk women are interested in this procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patricia Ganz, director of the division for cancer
prevention and control research at the Jonsson Cancer Center at the
University of California at Los Angeles, said that despite the
warnings, ``A lot of physicians and surgeons scare women, and there
is fear in the medical community that they will say to women, `You
ought to have your breasts removed.'''
</P>
<P>
   Among the 214 women at high risk and 425 at moderate risk, the
probably was for at least 20 and as many as 40 deaths. But after
the women had their breasts removed, there were only 2 deaths, both
in the high risk group.

<P>
   Dr. Barbara Weber, an expert on breast cancer genetics at the
University of Pennsylvania, and coauthor of an editorial that
accompanied the study, pointed out that although the procedure
theoretically saved 18 lives, 621 other women who had their breasts
removed probably would have survived without the drastic operation.
She also noted that it was ironic to find evidence supporting
breast removal in healthy women, when treatments for women who
already have cancer are aimed at saving the breast whenever
possible.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, she and other researchers said, many women with
strong family histories of breast and ovarian cancer are urged
strongly to have their ovaries removed, and many do so. But that
decision is less agonizing, because the surgery is not disfiguring,
and ovarian cancer, unlike breast cancer, is difficult to detect
early enough to save a woman's life.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Larry Norton, director of the Lauder Breast Center at
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said the study was
convincing and important. But the surgery ``is not for everybody,''
he said, adding, ``I would like very much to make this not an
option, to have better ways of preventing breast cancer in ways
that do not involve surgery.'' He said he hoped studies that would
be starting soon, combining a tamoxifen-like drug and other drugs
that manipulate hormone levels, would ultimately provide a risk
reduction equal to that shown for the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The number of women in the United States who have had their
breasts removed in the hope of preventing cancer is not known, but
may be in the thousands. There is no registry of cases. ``This is
not a commonly performed procedure,'' Hartmann said. She and other
researchers said that women who want it tend to be those who have
seen mothers, aunts and sisters die young from breast cancer, in
their 30s, 40s and 50s.

   Borgen said there had been a recent increase in interest in the
surgery, but did not think the number of procedures had risen with
the development during the 1990s of tests for mutations in the
genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, which greatly increase a woman's risk of
developing breast or ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we had a way to identify women who had an 85 percent
chance of developing breast cancer, women said, `What can you tell
me about prophylactic mastectomy?''' Borgen said. ``All we could
say was, `Gee, we think it works. But no studies have been done.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Although it might seem reasonable to assume that a woman without
a breasts cannot get breast cancer, proof was needed. Mastectomy
can remove only 90 to 95 percent of breast tissue, and many
researchers feared that the tissue left behind might harbor rogue
cells that could one day turn malignant.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hartmann and her colleagues sought to fill the information
gap by conducting a retrospective study, involving women who had
had the surgery in the past, rather than women going through it
now. They used the Mayo Clinic's medical records to identify 639
women who had prophylactic mastectomies there to prevent breast
cancer from 1960 to 1993. The women ranged from 18 to 79 years old
when they had the surgery, with a median age of 42 years. Half the
women had had the surgery 14 or more years before, and all had had
it at least five years previously. When the study was done, 609
were still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Petty, a plastic surgeon at the clinic and a co-author
of the study, said that the vast majority of the women who have the
surgery have their breasts reconstructed with implants. A total of
two operations are usually required, with several months of
recovery, he said. He estimated that the procedure costs about
$30,000. Dr. Hartmann said some insurance companies had refused to
cover the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The team classified 214 of the women as high risk because their
family histories suggested an inherited tendency to develop breast
cancer, Dr. Hartmann said. Many had mothers or sisters, or both,
with the disease, and in 150 of their families, there were three or
more breast cancers among close relatives. The women were not
tested for mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, but Dr. Hartmann said
the testing is under way now, and results will be presented in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   High-risk families like the ones identified in the study account
for 5 to 10 percent of the 180,000 new cases of breast cancer
diagnosed each year, Dr. Hartmann estimated.
</P>
<P>
   The other 425 study subjects, even though they had their breasts
removed, were considered to have been at only moderate risk. They
had fewer close relatives with the disease than the high-risk women
did, but, Dr. Hartmann said, many had chosen the surgery because of
their own histories of multiple breast lumps that required repeated
biopsies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one is an exercise in anxiety control,'' Dr. Hartmann
said. She said some women with that kind of history reach a point
where they look ahead and see an endless series of painful,
nerve-wracking biopsies, one of which they imagine will finally
give the result they have been dreading all along. And they decide
they might as well get it over with.
</P>
<P>
   To gauge the value of mastectomy, the researchers tried to
determine how many breast cancers would have developed and how many
women would have died if the surgery had not been performed. Then
they compared the expected numbers to the real ones.
</P>
<P>
   They did the calculations differently for the two groups of
women. For the 214 at high risk, they compared the women with their
own sisters, who had not undergone the preventive surgery. Since
siblings are similar genetically and usually share the same
environment growing up, they assumed the sisters' risk of breast
cancer would be similar.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of the breast cancers that developed in the
untreated sisters after the subjects had mastectomies, the
researchers calculated that 38 would have been expected in the
subjects. But only three occurred _ a reduction in risk of more
than 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, 10 deaths from breast cancer would have been
expected, but only 2 occurred--an 80 percent risk reduction.
</P>
<P>
   To predict cancer cases and deaths among the women with moderate
risk, the researchers used another method, one based on a computer
model (they did not use the model for the other group because it
was not designed for high-risk women).
</P>
<P>
   In the moderate group, 37.4 cases of breast cancer were
expected, and only four occurred, for a 90 percent reduction in
risk. Ten deaths were expected and none occurred _ a 100 percent
risk reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The Mayo Clinic did not disclose the names of women who
participated in the study. But a woman who had the surgery
elsewhere agreed to be interviewed. Staci Mishkin, 40, from
Springfield, Va., was delighted to hear of the study, which, she
said, ``validates what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Ms. Mishkin had both breasts removed. She was
perfectly healthy, but her mother, maternal grandmother and two of
her mother's sisters had died of breast cancer before they reached
50.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew growing up, my whole life, that women in my family got
breast cancer and died,'' she said. She herself tested positive for
a mutation in BRCA1. ``It was not a question of, will I get it?''
Ms. Mishkin said. ``It was a question of when.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mishkin, who has teenage children, said she had no regrets
over having her breasts removed, and said she believes doctors have
been overly hesitant about recommending the procedure to high-risk
women. ``'They wouldn't recommend it or not recommend it,'' she
said of her own operation. ``But now, with this study, they can say
this will reduce your risk 90 percent. They'll have to tell their
patients it's an option. It cannot be ignored anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Susan Love, a breast cancer expert and professor of surgery
at the University of California at Los Angeles, said that, thanks
to the study, ''Women who want to do this know they will at least
have some benefit. But it should drive us hard to find better
prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Love said that as a surgeon she did a few prophylactic
mastectomies, but only after several months of discussions with
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes your sister or mother gets diagnosed and you're so
panicked you want a quick fix,'' she said. ''I would suggest that
women not choose to do this at that moment in time.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said it was important to remember that seven women in
the study got breast cancer even though their breasts were removed.
``Nobody should come away thinking it's a guarantee,'' she said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the 13 Republican Congressmen appointed to
prosecute President Clinton appear before the Senate on Thursday to
begin presenting their case, they will follow a batting order and
game plan that reflect the delicate protocol of seniority, their
individual strengths and an egalitarian effort to give each of them
a turn in the spotlight of history.
</P>
<P>
   The first and last words will go to Rep. Henry J. Hyde of
Illinois, the 74-year-old chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee. The second speech will be given by Rep. F. James
Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, who has been in Congress and on the
Judiciary Committee longer than any of the 13 prosecutors except
Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles T. Canady of Florida, who was selected to anchor a
presentation on what constitutes an impeachable offense, held a
hearing on that question last fall in his capacity as chairman of
the House's constitution subcommittee. And three of the four
prosecutors chosen to lay out the actual evidence against Clinton
have extensive trial experience.
</P>
<P>
   But other prosecutors have no special aptitude for the roles
they are set to play, other than their willingness to play them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an excellent question,'' Rep. George W. Gekas of
Pennsylvania said Wednesday as he pondered why his assigned task
was a legal discussion of obstruction of justice and perjury, the
charges in the articles of impeachment against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no excellent response,'' he continued. ``I guess the
best answer _ and it's contrived _ is that all 13 of us could have
handled any part of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The 13 prosecutors, all members of the House Judiciary Committee
that held extensive hearings about Clinton's impeachment, are also
all lawyers, with a vast and varied array of experience between
them.
</P>
<P>
   While some sent drug dealers or murderers to prison, others
defended corporations against civil suits. Four worked as military
lawyers, three as federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   But many have not tried a case in years, even decades.
Sensenbrenner, for example, went almost directly from law school
into the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1969; the last time he made a
courtroom argument was in a divorce case in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked into the Senate chamber Wednesday to size up the
surroundings for the comments that he is scheduled to give
Wednesday, he acknowledged, ``It's the biggest speech I'll ever
give.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Sensenbrenner, most of the 13 prosecutors came to the
Senate chamber around 1 p.m. Wednesday to get a feel for the arena
in which they will fight an irrefutably uphill battle for Clinton's
expulsion from office. They wanted to see how the furniture was
arranged, where they would be sitting or standing at different
moments and how the easels and audio-visual technology they might
be using worked.
</P>
<P>
   At other times Wednesday, prosecutors holed up in their
individual offices, rehearsing their portions of the team's full
presentation for their staffs and making sure their comments fit
within time constraints. Each prosecutor is being given about an
hour or less; a few, however, will speak more than once.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde will briefly introduce the group when the Senate convenes
at 1 p.m. Thursday, then Sensenbrenner will deliver the formal
opening argument for their case.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors expect there will also be time Thursday for at least
three of the four congressmen to give presentations on the evidence
against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   They are Reps. Ed Bryant, a former federal prosecutor in
Tennessee, who will give an overview of all the evidence; Asa
Hutchinson, a former federal prosecutor in Arkansas, who will
discuss the facts related to obstruction of justice; and James E.
Rogan, a former deputy district attorney in Los Angeles, who will
discuss the basis for the perjury charge.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida will give a summation of the
evidence either late Thursday, when the Senate is expected to
remain in session until at least 7 p.m., or when the Senate
convenes again at 1 p.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia had been slated for McCollom's role
until early this week, when Barr shifted to an arguably less
prominent part. Officials working with the prosecution team said
the change did not reflect the fact that Barr's past was the
subject of a news conference held by magazine publisher Larry Flynt
on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Barr will be among the next four presenters, who will focus on
laws concerning perjury and obstruction of justice and argue that
the president broke them. The other presenters in this group are
Reps. Gekas, Steve Chabot of Ohio and Chris Cannon of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably four or five places I could have fit,''
said Cannon, formerly a lawyer for the Interior Department.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Reps. Canady, Graham and Steve Buyer of Indiana will
discuss the history of and constitutional guidelines for
impeachment. Their presentation could conclude Friday or roll over
into Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Canady said he specifically requested his role, because he had
begun researching the topic extensively last May. But he said late
Tuesday that he was still writing his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of in a frenzy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan and, finally, Hyde are currently scheduled to give the
closing arguments, which should come Saturday afternoon.

 &HT;    76th Texas Legislature makes plans to spend billions
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Legislature's leading budget writers laid
out plans Wednesday for the state to spend more than $91 billion
over the next two years, a 3.8 percent increase over the current
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rob Junell, D-San Angelo, and Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount
Pleasant, said they believe the proposed budget is responsible and
addresses the state's basic needs. It would increase spending by
$3.3 billion and also leave $2.5 billion for lawmakers to determine
how to spend.
</P>
<P>
   The $91.7 billion budget does not include $1.8 billion expected
to be spent on anti-smoking, health and education efforts. That
money will come from the state's lawsuit settlement with the
nation's tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Junell said budget writers felt it was appropriate to keep those
dollars, officially part of the state's general fund, separate so
that it is clear how they are spent. Much of the money could end up
in permanent endowments to support health and education programs,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The chairmen's budget, prepared by the Legislative Budget Board,
is the traditional starting point for the state budget process.
Gov. George W. Bush later this month will lay out his spending
proposals. The 10-member budget board is made up of the lieutenant
governor, the House speaker and the chairmen of eight key
legislative committees, including Finance and Appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   As they have for months, Junell and Ratliff continued to warn
that money left for lawmakers to decide how to spend won't cover
everyone's wish list.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not enough money to do everything that every
politician has promised to do to the extent they promised to do
it,'' said Junell, who's expected to be renamed chairman of the
House Appropriations Committee. ``We're going to continue to be
vigilant. Just because there is some money that could be used
doesn't mean that we should not continue to scrub these budgets.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there will be enough money to pay for proposals
Gov. George W. Bush laid out during his re-election campaign,
Ratliff said, ``It will be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Bush proposed $3.6 billion in new education
spending, eliminating the state's main business tax for small
companies and a limited sales tax break. All of that could be
accommodated if spending were lowered for other programs or taxes
were raised.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has not proposed either move. Instead, he has said
everyone's spending plans will have to be adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff's and Junell's proposed budget already is $3.3 billion
more than the $88.4 billion expected to be spent by Aug. 31, the
end of the current two-year budget cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff said all of the $3.3 billion increase is related to
growth in current obligations, like public education, prisons,
health care and public employees' retirement and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't take it on ourselves to start new programs. We
didn't take it on ourselves to make some changes in general
revenues,'' Junell added. General revenue is the part of the budget
funded with tax money and fees and that the Legislature controls.
The total budget includes federal money that must be spent as
Congress dictates and fees earmarked for certain projects, like
road work.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff said 85 percent of the proposed spending increase is due
to growth in education obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the $3.3 billion, $2.8 billion has to do with either public
(education) or higher education. I think that properly reflects the
priorities of the people of the state and of the legislators. I
think it is appropriate,'' said Ratliff, who is expected to be
renamed chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Hawkins, the governor's chief budget writer, said some of
Bush's campaign proposal could change, though others might remain
as outlined during his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the state budget is the primary job lawmakers face
every two years, the budget process in recent sessions has been
largely ignored. That's because spending once considered excessive
has been trimmed and few major fights have erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the most controversial part of the budget has been
so-called riders that put limits on how state money is spent. For
example, in 1997 Ratliff added a rider preventing state money from
being invested in companies associated with musical groups that use
violent or sexist lyrics. The courts have ruled that provision
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Ratliff says he wants to get rid of most of the
riders except the most basic dealing with employees' expenses and
travel.
</P>
<P>
   Extra money in state coffers this year could spur extra
attention to the budget debate. Last year, former Comptroller John
Sharp estimated the state would have $6.3 billion more than
expected for spending in the 2000-2001 budget years, which begin
Sept. 1. Newly elected Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander lowered
that figure to $5.6 billion last week.
</P>
<P>
   But Ratliff said many people, and perhaps some lawmakers, have
mistaken the extra money as $5.6 billion in discretionary dollars.
He's warned since before November elections that growth will
consume much of it, as the proposed budget shows.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, lines are long for a piece of the $2.5 billion left
over, and extra attention is likely to be paid to how the total
$5.6 billion and the tobacco money is used.

DISNEY INTEREST LIFTS GOLDEN BOOKS STOCK 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla.)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shares of Golden Books Family Entertainment rose
sharply Wednesday, a day after Michael Eisner, the chairman of Walt
Disney Co., said that Disney might be interested in acquiring the
troubled children's publishing company.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of a deal have been around for months, but this was the
first time Eisner was quoted on the subject. Speaking in New York
at an event to introduce Disney's Internet venture with Infoseek
Corp., Eisner said that his company had talked with Golden Books
and could make a bid to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Books declined to comment on any pending sale, though it
has hired the investment banker Allen &AMP; Co. to find an interested
buyer. Its shares rose 43.75 cents Wednesday, to 75 cents. Golden
Books stock has plummeted from a 52-week high of $11.875 last
February.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Books has based children's books on Disney characters and
films since 1932, and in 1997 paid $47.5 million for a five-year
renewal of its license. Not only was the price more than any
company previously had paid for a licensing deal, but it came as
the popularity of Disney animated films like ``Pocahontas'' was
falling short of previous hits.
</P>
<P>
   Since Disney is owed a large percentage of that deal, one
publishing executive noted that Golden Books, which has been
struggling financially and has a market value is $20.9 million,
might not be able to fulfill its agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Golden Books goes bankrupt, Disney won't get paid,'' the
executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said. ``So it
could be cheaper for them to buy the company.''

APPLE COMPUTER REPORTS 5TH CONSECUTIVE PROFITABLE QUARTER 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A resurgent Apple Computer Inc. on Wednesday
reported its fifth consecutive profitable quarter. Excluding a
one-time gain, Apple earnings exceeded Wall Street estimates by
more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's unit sales grew by 49 percent in the quarter,
year-over-year, several times the average for the personal computer
industry. Apple sold 519,000 of its translucent teal iMac's in the
quarter, fewer than the most optimistic analysts' forecasts, but a
huge number for any single computer model by any other measure.
Apple also had strong sales of its G3 Macintosh machines, aimed
primarily at professionals, even as these beige boxes are phased
out for a new line.
</P>
<P>
   Apple reported its financial results after the close of the
market. Apple shares closed at $46.50, up 37.5 cents, in Nasdaq
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J.P. Morgan, said Apple
delivered better than expected earnings in spite of revenues that
fell at the low end of estimates. ``I think investors are going to
look at that and be pretty pleased, especially since it wasn't like
Apple priced its product to fleece customers,'' he said. ``The
prices are pretty competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   For its fiscal 1999 first quarter, which ended Dec. 26, Apple
earned $152 million, or 95 cents a diluted share, more than three
times the $47 million, or 33 cents a share, earned in the
comparable quarter a year ago. Revenues rose 8 percent, to $1.71
billion, from $1.58 billion in the first quarter of the fiscal year
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent quarter included a $29 million after-tax gain
from the sale of 2.9 million shares of ARM Holdings P.L.C. Without
this nonrecurring item, Apple's earnings for the quarter would have
been $123 million, or 78 cents a diluted share. Analysts had
expected Apple to earn 70 cents a share, according to the First
Call Corp., which tracks earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Apple said its gross profit margin was 28.2 percent, up from
22.4 percent in the prior year. International sales accounted for
47 percent of the quarter's sales.
</P>
<P>
   One major contributor to the improved profit margins was strong
sales of System 8.5, the latest version of the Macintosh operating
system, Steven P. Jobs, Apple's co-founder and interim chief
executive, said in a telephone interview. ``People forget that we
own one of only two high-volume operating systems in the world, and
last quarter we came out with a new release and sold a lot of
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Apple also is operating at a higher level of efficiency than in
the past, Jobs said, noting that the company ended the quarter with
just $25 million in inventory, equivalent to about two days' worth
of product. Dell Computer Corp., generally considered the
industry's leader in lean operations, typically has seven days of
inventory, and some PC manufacturers have two to three times that.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs said that despite Apple's return to sustained earnings and
revenue growth he intended to keep costs low, with no plans to
return research and development spending to the company's historic
levels. ``I'm a big believer that what you get out of R &AMP; D is not
dependent on what you spend but on focus and leadership,'' he said.
``We're not looking to spend lots more on that.''

 &HT;    WITNESS: MICROSOFT LACKS MONOPOLY POWER
 &HT;    Eds: corrects spelling of ``reverse'' in final graf.
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington queues

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In opening its defense Wednesday against antitrust
charges, Microsoft Corp. called as its first witness an economist
who held that the software giant's Windows operating system did not
give it monopoly power over personal computer desktops.
</P>
<P>
   The view taken by Massachusetts Institute of Technology
economics professor Richard Schmalansee appeared to astound David
Boies, the government's lead attorney, as he began what promises to
be a lengthy cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   In bringing the landmark case, the government asserted that
Microsoft has illegally wielded its monopoly power by seeking to
extend its hold to the Internet while crushing its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's underlying power _ which is not illegal and
which is based on the fact that Windows runs on more than 90
percent of newly shipped personal computers _ had not been an issue
until Schmalansee took the stand.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, dean of MIT's Sloan School of Management, insisted
that Microsoft does not have a monopoly because its operating
system dominance is threatened by companies that could produce
rival technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree that (Windows) is a relevant market,''
Schmalansee told Boies. ``It makes no sense analytically. There are
developers out there writing for other platforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmalansee argued that such operating systems as Linux and
Beos, both of which run, along with Windows, on Intel-based
machines, were waiting in the wings as potential competitors, ready
to pounce on Microsoft's most valued turf. Even hand-held units,
such as those that run the Palm system, are ``competitors to
Windows,'' Schmalansee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you really mean to tell the judge that this hand-held
system is now a serious competitor to Windows?'' Boies asked
Schmalansee in an incredulous tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``My answer is no,''' Schmalansee replied, seemingly backing off
a bit. ``But it is the germ of a potential competitor. To rule it
out is to have a constricted view of the fluidity of this
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In filing 328 pages of testimony, Schmalansee wrote on page 250:
``Whatever one believes about Microsoft's power in the 'market' for
PC operating systems, the Windows desktop is surely not a relevant
market _ any more than the exterior of a Coke can is a 'market.' It
is only one of many effective channels of software distribution and
promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept of a ``relevant market'' is central to all antitrust
law. Unless the courts find that such a market in fact exists, a
finding that any company wields monopoly power, let alone abuses
that power by seeking to dominate other markets, cannot be made.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 states allege that Microsoft holds
a monopoly in the operating system for personal computers that it
has preserved and attempted to extend illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing Schmalansee's views, Boies said outside the
courtroom: ``It's like they used to say at the top in the former
Soviet Union that they were a democracy. They are not around
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmalansee took the stand after U.S. District Court Judge
Thomas Penfield
</P>
<P>
   Jackson denied a motion by Microsoft to dismiss antitrust
charges at the mid-point of the trial, now in its 11th week.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the ruling means that the government can now put on
its case. Since Jackson insisted that all testimony be submitted in
advance in written form, the Microsoft trial has taken place in
reverse, with nearly all the time being taken up by
cross-examination of hostile witnesses.

LUCENT ACQUIRES ASCEND IN $20 BILLION DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)  (rk) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In announcing its $20 billion acquisition of Ascend
Communications Inc. on Wednesday, Lucent Technologies Inc. called
it the ``largest technology merger ever'' and ``a leap rather than
a step,'' but there was an unmistakable whiff of ho-hum in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The high-technology marriage is a stock swap of .825 share of
Lucent for each share of Ascend, a 19 percent premium over Ascend's
market value when trading ended on Tuesday. The deal would have
been dramatic had it occurred a year ago, but by the time it was
done it seemed inevitable and perhaps even overdue to many analysts
and customers.
</P>
<P>
   With all the subtlety of a hurricane, the rapidly spreading
network of computers that makes up the Internet has been bearing
down on the traditional telecommunications routing and switching
equipment market. The regional Bell companies and other traditional
phone companies are competing with upstarts and their own big
corporate customers to build networks, both wired and wireless,
that handle voice, video and data services.
</P>
<P>
   To exploit the advantages it inherited as the leading supplier
in the traditional telecommunications market, Lucent, the former
manufacturing arm of AT&AMP;T, clearly needed to become a gorilla in
Internet equipment. The most straightforward way to get there
quickly was to buy a major Internet player.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend, the second-largest independent Internet supplier after
the far larger and fiercely independent Cisco Systems, was the
obvious candidate, especially after Lucent's longtime Canadian
rival, Northern Telecom Ltd., snapped up another Internet equipment
maker, Bay Networks Inc., for $7 billion last June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good about having gone first,'' said John A.
Roth, the chief executive of Northern Telecom, noting that Bay
Networks brought $2.5 billion in sales and a large engineering
group to his company at what looks like a bargain price compared
with what Lucent is paying for Ascend, which had $1.6 billion in
sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Roth said Northern Telecom, which operates under the Nortel
Networks brand name, was already well down the path of absorbing
Bay. In a separate announcement, Northern Telecom said Wednesday
that it was moving toward Bay's model of contracting out production
and would cut 8,000 jobs, or 10 percent of its work force, from its
other operations. It is the second round of job cuts in four months
at Northern Telecom, which laid off 3,500 employees in September.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts think Ascend is a far more valuable asset than
Bay, so the Lucent deal is a case of better late than never.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives Lucent a great technological boost,' said Robert
Rich, a telecommunications specialist at Yankee Group, a technology
research company in Boston. ``If you are looking for one-stop
shopping, Lucent will have more arrows in its quiver than anyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   That new range of products and services will be available by the
end of April if the deal closes as rapidly as Lucent and Ascend
hope. But just how potent it will be is up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent sees the world as speeding toward what it calls a
``network of networks.'' In such a world, there are huge profits to
be made in being able to knit together old and new switching and
routing technologies. Others, led by Cisco, see all communications
merging into the Internet and most of the profits going to those
with the best equipment to hasten the process.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent comes at the world from the perspective of the old-line
phone companies. For Cisco and others, the newer ``enterprise''
market of corporations and new service providers has been the
jumping off point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time may be on Cisco's side, but the question is how long it
will take,'' Rich said. ``The public networks owned by the phone
companies are still very profitable, well known, and well
managed.'' In addition, he noted, investing to adapt them may often
provide better returns than building new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts see Lucent as saddled with a slow-moving corporate
culture inherited from AT&AMP;T, which could clash with that of Ascend,
which was founded in 1989 and is based in Alameda, Calif., just
across San Francisco Bay from Silicon Valley. Mory Ejabat, Ascend's
chief executive and president, is committed to stay only through
the transition, and analysts wonder how many other executives will
also leave.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some analysts question Lucent's projection that the
deal will not hurt earnings in the current fiscal year, which ends
Sept. 30, and will raise them by up to 4 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real risk they won't sell as much as they think they
will because a lot of their current products compete head to
head,'' said Steven D. Levy, who follows the industry for Lehman
Brothers. Levy estimated that 45 percent of the products
overlapped, so some customers might switch products without
increasing the company's overall sales.
</P>
<P>
   Some competitors were also unimpressed, at least publicly. Larry
Lang, vice president for service provider networks at Cisco,
derided the deal as a defensive one that will end up helping his
company take more business from both Lucent and Ascend.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seem to be taking a wait-and-see attitude. Shares of
Lucent fell $3.625 Wednesday, to $104.25, not a remarkable move on
the day when the stock market was down and arbitragers who had
expected the deal were cashing in. Ascend rose $5.375, to $80.3125,
and was the most actively traded stock on Nasdaq.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I think it will go up as people digest this,'' said Alex Cena,
who follows the industry for Salomon Smith Barney. ``The phone
companies will now be able to split their business between Lucent
and Cisco, which is exactly what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   The real payoff for Lucent may come down the line in overseas
markets. The buyout of Ascend makes it a more potent competitor for
foreign rivals like Ericsson of Sweden, Alcatel of France and
Siemens AG of Germany at a time when Lucent is already making
inroads in the overseas markets those companies grew to dominate
during the decades Lucent was confined to supplying the domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans are not sitting still. Ericsson said Wednesday
that it would start reselling computer switches for phone and
Internet companies made by Juniper Networks Inc., a closely-held
start-up in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   And investors clearly expect one of the European companies to
buy Newbridge Networks Corp., a Canadian company that like Ascend
has been selling a switch that can handle data, voice and video on
phone lines with asynchronous transfer-mode technology. Newbridge's
shares jumped to $39 Wednesday before easing off and closing at
$36.1875, a 9.7 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, Cisco and other American equipment companies are facing
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity in many overseas markets as
governments divest the telephone companies they once owned and
allow competitors to take root. Indeed, even analysts skeptical
about the value of the Ascend deal were pleased by Lucent's
announcement Wednesday that it had also bought 12.2 percent of
Amper SA, a Spanish equipment maker and installer, for $49 million.
</P>
<P>
   That deal could help Lucent become a major supplier to Amper's
primary owner, Telefonica, Spain's largest telephone company.
Telefonica also has a stake in the potentially huge Brazilian
market, which could open doors there for Lucent.

 &HT;    Taft bids to improve Ohio Lottery profits, hopes new hire
Mitchell Brown will help
 &HT;    By Debra Jasper
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As he announced the new executive director of the
Ohio Lottery Commission and three other new members of his cabinet
Wednesday, Gov. Bob Taft said he wants his administration to manage
the lottery more efficiently and make it more viable.
</P>
<P>
   Taft said lottery profits have been stagnant for some time and
he's concerned about the impact declining sales could have on
schools. He said he wants Mitchell Brown, his newly named executive
director, to examine the lottery's operations and make
recommendations in the coming months for improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Taft said he doesn't want to see children or those with gambling
problems encouraged to play the lottery, but said some kind of new
marketing campaign may be needed. Taft declined to give specifics
of what, if any, new lotto games he'd like to see in Ohio, saying
``I'm not an expert on gaming.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, of Columbus, was director of the Department of Public
Safety in the Voinovich Administration. In that position, he
oversaw the work of 3,367 employees and budget of $844 million. His
responsibilities included oversight of the Bureau of Motor
Vehicles, the Ohio State Highway Patrol, and the Emergency
Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Taft said he has about 10 more cabinet positions to fill,
depending on whether he consolidates some departments. The other
three cabinet members named Wednesday are: Lee Johnson, of
Carefree, Ariz., director of the Department of Development; Joan
Lawrence, of Galena, director of the Department of Aging; and Major
General John Smith, of Columbus, adjutant general.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson retired in October 1998, as president of Limited
Distribution Services, a subsidiary of The Limited Inc. He also has
more than 15 years of senior management experience in the consumer
products and pharmaceutical industries industries , with Beatrice
Companies and Warner Lambert Company.
</P>
<P>
   He currently resides in Carefree, Ariz., and will be relocating
to Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   While employed in Columbus, Johnson served as chair of the Board
of Directors of Port Columbus International Airport; and served as
chair of the Columbus Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Taft said he got to know Johnson when Johnson worked at the
Chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of the most experienced business executives anywhere
in the country,'' Taft said.
</P>
<P>
   During Johnson's tenure as chair of the Columbus Chamber, the
area was designated Small Business Development Region of the Year,
with $25 million in increased sales and 755 new jobs. In addition,
the Chamber helped attract $108 million in new investment to the
Columbus area, bringing in 1,279 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will take office in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   Taft said Lawrence, who has been a state legislator for 16
years, is a registered nurse who will be a ``strong advocate for
Ohio seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence was the primary sponsor of Ohio's welfare reform
legislation, and is a member of the legislature's Welfare Oversight
Council monitoring the implementation of welfare reform at the
county level. She also chairs the Human Services Subcommittee of
the House Finance and Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Major General John Smith currently commands the Ohio Air
National Guard, including more than 5,000 Air National Guard
members in 11 units. He is a command pilot with more than 4,000
flight hours, and flew combat missions over the Republic of Vietnam
in 1965.

JUSTICES HEAR ARGUMENTS ON WELFARE POLICY AND RIGHT TO TRAVEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The debate before the Supreme Court on Wednesday
was over welfare policy _ whether states can have a lower level of
benefits for newcomers than for longtime residents _ but the deeper
issue was the meaning of citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   California was asking the court to permit it to do what Congress
authorized in the 1996 welfare law: hold newcomers, for their first
year of residency, to the welfare benefits they would have received
in their home state, often hundreds of dollars a month lower.
</P>
<P>
   California's deputy attorney general, Theodore Garelis,
complained that the state's search for ``flexibility'' in its
welfare policy had been ``stymied and hampered'' by lower court
rulings, which have invoked the constitutional right to travel to
block the state program from taking effect.
</P>
<P>
   At the most, Garelis said, the right to travel was affected only
``incidentally and remotely'' by a ``carefully crafted'' state law
that amounts to ``just a benefit-setting adjustment for one year.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg objected. The whole point of the
court's precedents on the right to travel was that new residents
and longtime residents were entitled to equal treatment, she said,
adding: ``That is the genius of the United States. People can pick
their states, but the states can't pick their people.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the hour-long argument, the court appeared deeply
engaged by this case, which brings today's moderate-to-conservative
justices face to face with one of the liberal Warren Court's more
expansive constitutional doctrines. Significant as the case is for
national welfare policy, it could also be an important indicator of
the court's current approach to constitutional interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution does not mention a right to travel, but
decisions in the 1960s derived it from the guarantee of equal
protection. In a 1969 case, Shapiro vs. Thompson, the court invoked
the right to travel to strike down state laws that barred newcomers
from receiving welfare benefits during their first year of
residency. Several briefs filed in the case on Wednesday, including
one signed by New York and 15 other states on California's behalf,
asked the court to overrule Shapiro vs. Thompson as an
illegitimately created ``fundamental right.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices expressed little interest in accepting that invitation,
with the possible exception of Justice Antonin Scalia, who appeared
intent on trivializing the issue with several references to his
ambition to take a vacation in Louisiana and invoke the right to
travel in order to get a hunting and fishing license at in-state
rates.
</P>
<P>
   When Mark D. Rosenbaum, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer
representing the successful challengers to the California law,
pointed out that the right to travel applied to residents, not
tourists, Scalia professed not to understand the distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Garelis, the state's lawyer, told the court that California's
approach did not run afoul of Shapiro vs. Thompson because, by
reducing but not refusing benefits, ``we're not trying to deter
travel in any way, shape or form.'' He said the state was ``merely
neutralizing one factor that someone might care to consider when
moving to California.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand that,'' Justice Stephen G. Breyer objected.
He said the only difference between cutting off benefits, which the
Shapiro case prohibited, and reducing benefits ``is that you're
more generous, but not really much more generous.'' He asked why
California's approach would be constitutional simply ``because
you're trying to save a little less money.''
</P>
<P>
   If California were allowed to put the policy into effect, it
would save something under one-half of one percent of its annual
welfare expenditure.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Anderson vs. Roe, No. 98-97, is complicated by the
fact that, while the California law dates to 1992, Congress
subsequently authorized temporary two-tier welfare benefits as part
of its major reworking of federal welfare policy in 1996. Fifteen
other states also provide lower benefits for newcomers, although
most of the laws have been blocked by federal or state judges. The
California law was struck down twice, before and after the federal
law took effect, by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in San
Francisco.

</P>
<P>
   Although the constitutionality of the federal law was not
directly before the Supreme Court on Wednesday, it had a role in
the argument, prompting the solicitor general, Seth P. Waxman to
offer an argument in defense of the theory behind the federal law.
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy asked Garelis whether ``Congress can
somehow permit what otherwise would not be allowed'' under the
right to travel.
</P>
<P>
   The state's lawyer replied that the existence of the federal law
minimized what would otherwise be a concern about conflicting
policies that could ``balkanize the various states.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How is the concern minimized if Congress says go ahead and
balkanize?'' Justice David H. Souter asked. If the state's purpose
was the illegitimate one of interfering with the right to travel,
he continued, ``is there anything Congress can do to take the
poison out of that purpose?''
</P>
<P>
   Souter answered his own question. ``I would have thought not,''
he said, adding pointedly to Garelis: ``We're playing with words.''
</P>
<P>
   Waxman did not fare much better in his part of the argument,
which did not necessarily endorse California's approach. The court
appeared impatient with the solicitor general's nuanced position,
which his 10 minutes of allotted time left him little chance to
articulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else does Congress have the right to authorize a state
to discriminate among its citizens?'' Souter demanded. Ginsburg
told the solicitor general she was ``really astonished'' by his
argument that the case involved simply a ``transitional choice of
law'' during a newcomer's first year of residency. The American Bar
Association called this argument ``mysterious'' in a brief
attacking the administration position.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union
of Southern California, offered a spirited defense of his lower
court victory. The law was ``antithetical to the core values of our
federal system of dual sovereignty,'' he said, adding that the
principle that ``citizens are free to vote with their feet and to
act on whatever their needs and tastes are'' was a ``notion that
absolutely saturates'' the court's cases explaining the shared
federal-state system.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the two named plaintiffs in Rosenbaum's class action
lawsuit, identified only as Brenda Roe and Anna Doe, were welfare
recipients when they moved to California from Oklahoma and
Washington, D.C. Ms. Doe had a job, and Ms. Roe's husband was
employed but lost his job when he stayed home to care for her
during a complicated pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   California officials told Ms. Roe she would get Oklahoma's
benefit of $307 a month instead of California's $565. Ms. Doe was
limited to the $330 a month provided by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In other court business on Wednesday, the court ruled, 9-0, that
the Constitution's guarantee of due process does not require the
police, after seizing items from a home during an authorized
search, to inform the owner how to regain the property. Rather, the
police must simply notify the owner that the property has been
taken, ``so the owner can pursue available remedies for its
return,'' Kennedy said in his opinion for the court in West Covina
vs. Perkins, No. 97-1230. The decision overturned a ruling by the
9th Circuit.

EXPERT ANGLERS TO SHARE KNOWLEDGE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Private boaters favor downriggers when
trolling because angling lines can be set at the specific depth in
the water column where game fish have been located.
</P>
<P>
   The baited line is clipped to the downrigger's wire cable, and a
lead ball submerges the setup.
</P>
<P>
   A problem occurs, however, when big game _ especially mako
sharks in Southern California, but also billfish, tuna, wahoo and
dorado _ swim forward after getting hooked instead of away from the
boat, as they do an estimated 90 percent of the time. The fishing
line can get tangled in the cable and, snap, the fish of a lifetime
is lost in the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P>
   Solution:
</P>
<P>
   Crimp 100 feet of 100-pound monofilament line to the cable. Clip
the lead ball and fishing line onto the monofilament and lower it
down. Now when the mako swims forward after biting the bait, the
lighter-strength and smaller-diameter fishing line _ often 30-pound
test _ knifes through the downrigger line.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lose your downrigger ball and you save your fish,'' said
George Poveromo, a marine-angling authority from Parkland, Fla.,
who offered the lesson. ``To most fishermen, catching that fish far
exceeds the expense of buying another downrigger ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The tried-and-true technique ``is something that very few people
know about,'' claimed Poveromo, 40, senior editor for Salt Water
Sportsman magazine.
</P>
<P>
   He and a crew of national and regional experts will be offering
a slew of such ``secrets'' Saturday in Long Beach during the only
West Coast stop of the Salt Water Sportsman National Seminar
Series, billed as the world's most comprehensive ocean-angling
educational tour.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember to keep some extra downrigger sinkers in the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Don't know how to crimp on line, you say. The seminar textbook
devotes an entire chapter to the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Geared to private boaters, the program recommends tackle and
tactics for anglers who don't rely on party-boat captains to find
the fish and deckhands to work the rigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to you to come up with the most productive technique
to find and land fish,'' explained seminar host Poveromo. ``And if
you know there are fish out there and they aren't biting, you have
to be able to switch to another technique to catch them. The
seminar helps improve your knowledge of those tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Anglers who patronize party boats exclusively can also benefit
from the seminar, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   In a picky bite, for example, increase your chances of getting
hit by scaling down the size of the leader and hook and getting
less terminal tackle in the water _ which appears less conspicuous
to the fish. ``You may spend more time fighting the fish and that
may increase the chances of losing fish, but wouldn't you rather
take that gamble by increasing your chances of getting hooked up?''
said Poveromo.
</P>
<P>
   The program will also profile such specifics as fluorocarbon
leaders, which are significantly more expensive than traditional
line but are promoted as being less visible to fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that participants would walk away knowing several
different techniques that will help them catch their favorite game
fish,'' Poveromo said.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception in 1988, the series has produced some 60,000
``graduates.'' To better saturate the topic, several experts appear
on stage at the same time to address each species or tactic and
demonstrate technique.
</P>
<P>
   Poveromo will be joined by television fishing-series host Spider
Andresen and several area speakers, including big-game author and
shark and tuna guru Fred Archer, inshore and offshore light-tackle
authority Greg Stotesbury, tuna and marlin hunter Randy Wood, and
calico-bass and artificial-lure tactician Barry Brightenburg. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
IF YOU'RE GOING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Water Sportsman National Seminar Series makes a layover
Saturday at the Carpenter Performing Arts Center at Cal State Long
Beach, 6200 Atherton St. in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The six-hour program begins at 9 a.m. and concludes at 4 p.m.,
with a one-hour lunch break at noon.
</P>
<P>
   Cost is $40. Tickets are available atthe door or in advance by
calling (800) 448-7360. Doors open at 8 a.m.; telephone-ordered
tickets can be picked up then.
</P>
<P>
   Each ``student'' receives a 106-page course textbook and a
chance to win door prizes, including an angling trip to the Bahamas
and an outboard fishing boat.

MARINE RESERVES GET MORE ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While the state Fish and Game Commission has put
the proposal to ban fishing along portions of the Northern Channel
Islands on the back burner, it has adopted a strict time line to
take action on the greater issue of creating more marine reserves
throughout California.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue that is receiving a lot of attention, not
only in California but worldwide, and the commission believes that
it needs to be aired and discussed,'' said Bob Treanor, executive
director of the five-member commission's staff. ``The commissioners
need to gain information from scientists who are working on this
issue, from the public and from the fishing community.''
</P>
<P>
   Treanor this week detailed the commission's plans.
</P>
<P>
   The commission decided Feb. 6 during its monthly meeting to
delay voting on the fishing-ban proposal until it receives a state
report on marine reserves that is part of the Ocean Initiative
ordered in 1997 by then-Gov. Pete Wilson to study the health of
saltwater environments, Treanor said.
</P>
<P>
   The report is expected to be completed by a task force of the
state Resources Agency _ which oversees the Department of Fish and
Game among others _ ``within the next couple of months,'' he said.
The report will look at reserves and refuges to establish a
standardized definition of each.
</P>
<P>
   The commission believes it will be able to use the data and work
with the DFG and Resources Agency task force to draft, by year's
end, a statewide policy on how to consider requests for adopting
marine reserves, commonly known as ``no take'' or ``no harvest''
zones that are off-limits to fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Within that time frame, the commission expects to identify 5 to
20 percent of the shoreline around the five islands in the Channel
Islands National Park for possible protection as marine reserves,
said the commission's executive director. Initiators of the
fishing-ban proposal recommend that no less than 20 percent of the
islands' shoreline be protected out to 1 nautical mile to replenish
dwindling fish stocks; they also want San Nicolas Island _ situated
outside of the national park _ to be included in a ban.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's two-member Marine Subcommittee will monitor the
progress of the Resources Agency's report and apprise the
commission at each of its monthly meetings, the next of which is
Feb. 4-5 in Sacramento. If the subcommittee determines there is
lack of progress in releasing their report, it will ask the
commission to reconsider the Channel Islands' ban issue directly,
Treanor said.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever route the commission follows, proponents and
detractors of fishing bans will have their chance to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we progress, there will be a specific agenda item
soliciting public input,'' said Treanor. He expects a draft of the
policy addressing future marine-reserve proposals to be issued by
the commission in late summer or fall and that public comment will
be heard on the item in October or November.
</P>
<P>
   While a fishing ban can be put in place within 90 to 120 days of
a Fish and Game Commission approval, Treanor said it is not likely
that any no-take zones will be established in the Channel Islands
National Park in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Also at last week's meeting, the commission discussed the
possibility of creating, within 60 days, a scientific panel and a
separate group consisting of sport anglers, commercial harvesters
and divers and other recreationists to provide the Marine
Subcommittee information, issues and criteria for consideration in
drafting the policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Channel Islands fishing-ban proposal has become a heated
issue between anglers and environmentalists _ and between anglers
themselves. Recreation fishers argue they should not be lumped into
a ban when statistics show the overwhelming majority of state
fishing takes come from commercial harvesting; commercial anglers
claim they are victims of a proposal that was largely brought about
by recreational anglers concerned about the exploitation of finned
species through sport-fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Channel Islands National Park _ one of
the proposal's two initiators _ are pleased with the direction the
Fish and Game Commission is taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there has been a major change in direction since
last spring, when we first discussed it formally with the
commission,'' said Gary Davis, the national park's senior
biologist. ``It seems now that their focus is how, not if marine
reserves should be part of the management scheme for the Channel
Islands and all of California. I hear the commissioners saying we
need to think globally and act locally, and the Channel Islands are
the place to act locally.''
</P>
<P>
   Commercial anglers are concerned with the commission's new
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``A commercial guy's first response is that he doesn't want to
be precluded from fishing any waters, but if the science suggests
the resource is going to benefit from such a ban he'd be all for
it,'' said Santa Barbara's Kevin Crisp, president of the Sea Urchin
Harvesters' Association of California. ``But the burden of proof is
on the science, and it hasn't been there. The reality is that there
isn't hardly any research on marine reserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Detractors have argued that California's existing 104
marine-protected areas are too small, too infrequently monitored
and lacking substantial amounts of fish to execute conclusive
studies, and many biologists _ Davis included _ agree.
</P>
<P>
   But Fish and Game Commission members have grown frustrated with
requests for more research and want to consider other options to
tackle overfishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Study is no longer an idea, and there is no state money for
studies,'' said commissioner Frank Boren. ``We need to try
something, and if the no-take zone is the only thing to try, then
we have two choices _ try it or ignore the problem.''! &UR; end! &LR;  &QL;

WARNER BROS. PARTNERS WITH FORTUNECITY ON WEB SITE FOR FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. -- Warner Bros. announced Wednesday a major
cyberspace expansion, launching an ACMEcity.com site named after
the mythical company of its ``Road Runner'' cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   The site, a joint venture of Warner Bros. and Internet design
specialist FortuneCity, will allow users to create their own Web
pages using images and audio clips from Warner cartoons, TV shows
like ``Friends'' and music acts like Depeche Mode. ACMEcity has 14
community sites grouped into film, TV, music and comics-animation
but plans to add 50 more within its first year.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Butt, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, said the
approach is a logical way for Warner Bros. to exploit its fan base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We encourage companies to take this approach, because it makes
your fans into your allies,'' he added. ``It creates a ton of
goodwill since you're allowing your fan base to grow and prosper
rather than just sending the message that you want to milk the last
penny out of the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies sealed the deal with studio parent Time Warner
Inc. making an investment into FortuneCity and agreeing to supply
an impressive $100 million of marketing support during the next
five years. They said the partnership will develop hundreds of
sites within ACMEcity with content reviewed for
``community-zoning'' compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, which made the announcement a day after rival The Walt
Disney Co. launched its ambitious Go Network ``portal'' service,
has high hopes for the service. ``The collaborative result will be
the largest entertainment-oriented community on the Internet,
creating a protected environment that is safe for families and
advertisers alike,'' said Jim Moloshok, president of Warner Bros.
Online.
</P>
<P>
   Work on the project began four months ago with the arrival of a
dozen FortuneCity employees in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than going around saying you can't use this and
threatening to sue, the idea is to let the fans use what they
want,'' said Richard Jones, co-vice chairman of 2-year-old
FortuneCity. ``So, instead of clamping down, you're releasing their
creativity and the benefits are massive.''

 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A small group of Senate Republicans has met
secretly with the House impeachment prosecutors to establish
standards for calling witnesses, even as the prosecutors have
approached Monica Lewinsky and Kathleen Willey to see if they would
testify in the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   The question of calling witnesses to testify before the Senate
has badly divided Democrats and Republicans as they set procedures
for the trial. After a rare bipartisan meeting last Friday, all 100
senators agreed to vote on whether to call witnesses later in the
month, after hearing opening arguments from the House managers and
the White House beginning on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the agreement, Sens. Trent Lott, the majority
leader and Tom Daschle, the minority leader, announced that a
bipartisan group of four senators would meet to try to hash out how
the Senate would deal with the witness issue at a later date. But
that group fell apart almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Lott then quietly went ahead on his own and appointed three
Senate Republicans who have said publicly that they favor calling
witnesses _ Jon Kyl of Arizona, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and
Jeff Sessions of Alabama _ to work with Rep. Henry J. Hyde of
Illinois, the lead manager, and his aides. They were assigned to
devise criteria for witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats were belatedly invited to a meeting of the new
group on Monday, but Daschle rejected the offer. ``Senator
Daschle's position is that we voted on an unanimous bipartisan
level to put off the question of witnesses, so it would not be in
keeping with that agreement to start a discussion about whether to
call witnesses,'' said Ranit Schmelzer, a spokeswoman for Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spurned a similar offer from the Republican
senators after the Senate Democrats said no.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans insisted Wednesday that their discussions
with the House managers were aimed at continuing the bipartisan
spirit borne out of Friday's meeting in the Old Senate Chamber.
``We conveyed the sense of the Republican caucus, and the joint
caucus, that a large number of witnesses were not going to be
permitted,'' Specter said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said the senators were careful not to advise the House
managers on which witnesses to call. But Specter said that
witnesses who could help resolve conflicting testimony or who were
``important in tenor and tone'' stood the best chance of winning
majority support.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the House managers confirmed that meetings had
taken place, but said that senators had benefited more than the
House managers from the talks.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of opening arguments in the trial, the maneuvering
over witnesses coincided with an implicit threat in the White House
legal brief filed Wednesday, in which Clinton's lawyers argued that
any witnesses would require a lengthy full discovery process and
perhaps the calling of additional witnesses by the defense team.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and the White House have balked at any suggestion that
senators need to hear from witnesses like Ms. Lewinsky, partly
because of the fear that the trial would spin out of control with
unpredictable testimony and a desire to wrap up the proceedings
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But evidence of the House managers' adamant intention to try to
persuade at least 51 senators to approve deposing a list of
witnesses surfaced again Wednesday. Hyde's aides disclosed that Ms.
Lewinsky's lawyer, Plato Cacheris, had refused a request from one
of the House managers to set up an informal meeting with the former
White House intern to question her and gauge her credibility.
``Implicit in the House's rights to request witnesses is the
responsibility of the managers to determine who those witnesses
will be,'' said Paul J. McNulty, a spokesman for the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans paraded out of an afternoon meeting Wednesday
insisting that over the next few weeks, they could do legislative
business in the mornings and the impeachment trial in the
afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how the usually deliberative Senate could pull off
such a feat, Sen. Connie Mack of Florida, a member of the
Republican leadership, borrowed an explanation often attributed to
Clinton's ability to juggle several complicated subjects
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a phrase we didn't use very often around here,'' Mack
said. ``It is compartmentalization.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Democrats voiced fears that a lengthy trial with many
witnesses would hinder regular Senate business. ``The key question
is the number of witnesses,'' said Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman,
D-Conn. ``If there are not too many witnesses, it won't take too
long to depose them. My guess is that we're done by sometime early
to mid-February.''
</P>
<P>
   But if many witnesses are called, Lieberman said, the trial
could extend into March.
</P>
<P>
   A main goal of the House managers will to be persuade at least
51 senators to approve deposing a list of witnesses, and after
their depositions are taken, allow them to testify in the actual
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers have talked about summoning about six
witnesses, including Ms. Lewinsky, Betty Currie, the president's
secretary, and John Podesta, the White House chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, two of the managers, Reps. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas
and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, met with Kathleen Willey, a
former White House volunteer, and her lawyer, Dan Gecker, to
discuss the possibility of her appearing as a witness, said a
Republican aide and another person familiar with the case.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers, meeting in the office of a third manager, Rep.
James E. Rogan of California, spoke about an allegation that
Clinton groped Ms. Willey, but they focused mainly on whether Ms.
Willey was pressured to change her story. The House prosecutors are
interested in Ms. Willey's case to bolster the obstruction of
justice charge.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the managers' case is the charge that Clinton
offered a cleverly worded lie about his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky and then schemed to cover up the affair.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers filed their trial brief on Monday, a 105-page
document that provides a road map of their case. The managers are
seeking to persuade senators that a chain of events, read in its
entirety, demonstrates a compelling argument for the president's
ouster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll come in with a long list of witnesses,''
Hyde said Wednesday night on ABC News' ``Nightline.'' ``It is my
expectation and request to our managers that they not call a
witness unless the witness has something substantive to
contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said the managers were walking a fine line in their
presentation to senators. ``I hope we don't bore them,'' he said,
``but the more detailed information we give them, the less they
want to call witnesses.''

LUC SNUB LEAVES KINGS SORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles Kings coach Larry Robinson didn't mince words.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the All-Star snub of left wing Luc Robitaille,
Robinson admitted to extreme disappointment Wednesday at the
omission of the NHL's third-leading goal scorer from the North
American roster that will face the World team on Jan. 24 in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very surprised,'' said Robinson, whose team plays the
Calgary Flames at 7:30 tonight at the Forum. ``I was more surprised
when I saw who's on. I'm not saying (Montreal's) Mark Recchi is not
a great hockey player. But he's having a horse(bleep) year. The
All-Star Game is not about what you did. It's about what you're
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille has 22 goals and 40 points this season, along with a
plus-4 defensive rating. Recchi, with eight goals and 29 points and
a minus-10 rating, is the only Canadien in the game. The only King
chosen was defenseman Rob Blake.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't give me the line that every team has to be
represented,'' Robinson said. ``In that case, why weren't we
represented last year? I think it's unfair. (General Manager Dave
Taylor) and I have been saying all along we don't get any respect
on the West Coast. Blakey's winning of the Norris Trophy (last
season) was the first recognition we've gotten out here in a long,
long, long time. It's the forgotten land.''
</P>
<P>
   Departed friend: Robinson was in a reflective mood Wednesday,
the day after former Montreal Canadiens teammate Doug Wickenheiser
died after a long battle with cancer at 37. Robinson was in his
ninth season when the Canadiens selected Wickenheiser first overall
in the 1980 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was between Wick and Denis Savard as to who Montreal would
pick first overall,'' Robinson recalled. ``Wick came to Montreal
and Denis went on to set a million records in Chicago. It was
always a sore spot in Montreal because Wick never had the impact
Denis did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very sad day. Life's not fair sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray pained: Glen Murray's right knee was feeling good - maybe
too good. Now, it's not feeling very good at all.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor called Murray ``an impatient patient,'' and that
impatience has caught up with the Kings' best all-around winger,
who has experienced pain and swelling in his right knee in recent
days, forcing him to curtail workouts. Murray tore the medial
collateral ligament in his knee 12 days ago and is expected to miss
at least another six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling great,'' said Murray, the Kings' second-leading
scorer. ``But the last couple of days have been awful. I worked out
too hard, riding the bike and lifting weights. It was stupid. I've
got to lay off it. I was feeling great, I wasn't feeling sore when
I was working out. I thought I'd be back in a couple of weeks. I
thought wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said he does not think his current setback will delay his
return to the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: Defenseman Doug Bodger is expected back in the
lineup tonight after missing six games with a cervical strain after
being blind-sided two weeks ago by Dallas Drake of Phoenix. ...
Jamie Storr, who has a bruised left hand, is expected to start in
goal tonight, with Stephane Fiset as the backup. Fiset experienced
soreness in his groin following Monday's 4-0 loss at San Jose, but
the Kings are downplaying the seriousness of the situation, even
though their No. 1 goalie has battled groin injuries all season.
... Winger Russ Courtnall, who suffered a broken foot when struck
by a puck eight weeks ago, remains a couple of weeks from returning
to the lineup. Courtnall admitted the rehabilitation routine is
wearing thin. ``I can lift weights and ride the bike with
anybody,'' he said. Courtnall is scheduled to be X-rayed today. ...
Minor-league goalie Ryan Bach, sidelined six weeks with an
abdominal strain, is about a week from returning to action for Long
Beach and worked out with the Kings on Wednesday because the Ice
Dogs are on the road.

LAWMAKERS IN BOTH PARTIES WEIGH COMPROMISE PLANS TO REVAMP SOCIAL
SECURITY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time since President Clinton put
Social Security's financial problems at the top of the national
agenda, key members of both parties are seriously examining
compromise proposals that could be acceptable both to Democrats who
want to keep the retirement system intact and to Republicans
pushing for a shift to private investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals center on investment accounts that would
supplement Social Security rather than replace part of it. In the
versions that are getting the most attention, the accounts would be
voluntary but would carry incentives, in the form of matching
government contributions or tax breaks, to encourage people to
save.
</P>
<P>
   Such plans would also have to include some combination of tax
increases and benefit cuts to deal with Social Security's looming
financial shortfall, although some would seek to solve most of the
problem by allowing the government to invest Social Security's
excess cash in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals would basically leave the current Social Security
system intact, in an effort to make the outcome palatable to
liberals, while giving supporters of individualized investment a
limited form of the private accounts they are seeking.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to find a middle ground is at an early stage, and
neither the White House nor the Republican leadership is openly
supporting any particular compromise. Many of the ideas are in
sketchy form, and the degree of support they attract could depend
in great degree on arcane details.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have discussed one variant of the
voluntary account approach with House Democrats, who say they are
open to the idea. A moderate Democrat in the House who has worked
across the aisle on a number of contentious issues, Rep. Benjamin
L. Cardin of Maryland, said he is drafting a similar plan and has
gotten encouraging responses from Republicans with whom he has
consulted.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, the White House economic adviser, declined to
discuss details of the plans the administration is weighing. But he
said Wednesday that Clinton would work closely with members of
Congress in the next few months so he can develop ``a strong sense
of where the basis for support and ultimately bipartisan consensus
can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the strongest backers of private investment
accounts said they are open to a deal built around voluntary
accounts, although they cautioned that much would depend on the
details.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most we can hope for as reformers is a very small
incremental set of changes, given the political environment we're
in,'' said Rep. Mark Sanford, a Republican from South Carolina who
is an aggressive advocate of private accounts. ``With that in mind
I look more favorably on the idea of tax-incentivized savings.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who is
chairman of the Finance Committee, is pushing another approach
built around individual accounts into which the government would
make contributions for the next five years using half of the
federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Under Roth's approach, the accounts would not technically be
part of the Social Security system. But Roth said his plan provides
``a means of moving ahead on a matter that has a direct relation to
Social Security,'' and seems to be similar to ideas being
considered by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful that we're seeing the beginning of a consensus
that could be very helpful,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans, however, said they would continue to push for
a fundamental overhaul of Social Security under which mandatory
private accounts would be financed out of the 12.4 percent payroll
tax assessed on workers and their employers.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties said the real question is whether both
sides will determine that they are better off reaching a deal now
on Social Security rather than leaving the issue on the table for
use as a political weapon in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has made clear he favors seeking higher
investment returns in some way to help cover a financial gap that
will leave Social Security unable to pay all beneficiaries fully
starting in 2032. So far he has deflected pressure from Republicans
who want him to put a specific plan on the table.
</P>
<P>
   But his advisers have broached a number of possibilities in
recent weeks, including a plan under which retirement accounts
would be set up outside of Social Security as a way of reassuring
liberal Democrats that reform need not involve dismantling the
guaranteed benefit system.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, contributions by workers would be matched by the
government in the same way that employers match contributions to
401(k) plans, and could be set up to give the greatest incentives
to low and moderate income workers.
</P>
<P>
   Cardin's plan would establish voluntary accounts within the
Social Security system. The government would give a tax rebate or
make a direct payment into accounts to workers up to a certain
income level, probably about $40,000, Cardin said.

LOTT'S TIES TO GROUP ACCUSED OF RACISM ARE DISPUTED
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. _ If, as Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has
insisted for a month, he has ``no first-hand knowledge'' of the
views of the Council of Conservative Citizens, which calls itself
pro-white, it comes as news to a lot of people back home, including
his Uncle Arnie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trent is an honorary member,'' said Arnie Watson, a former
state senator, tax assessor and currently a member of the council's
executive board.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's spoken at meetings,'' added Watson, whom Lott once fondly
recalled as his ``favorite uncle'' from the days during Lott's
youth when his grandfather and uncles gathered to talk politics on
the porch.
</P>
<P>
   But after a month of questioning and scrutiny about his
relationship with the group, Lott issued a statement Wednesday
night, saying: ``I have made my condemnation of the white
supremacist and racist view of this group, or any group, clear. Any
use of my name to publicize their view is not only unauthorized,
it's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult for any conservative politician here _
Democrat or Republican _ to remain ignorant of the Council of
Conservative Citizens.
</P>
<P>
   There are 34 members of the Mississippi Legislature among its
roughly 5,000 members in the state, said William Lord, the state
coordinator, and prominent politicians, including Gov. Kirk
Fordice, a fellow Republican, regularly speak at its meetings and
rallies, which are festooned with the Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   The council embraces a range of conservative causes, including
opposition to unfettered immigration and busing for school
desegregation, and promotes ``Southern cultural issues.'' It held
its semiannual national convention here in Jackson just after the
November elections, with Fordice as the keynote speaker. The
governor and the roughly 300 people present stood and sang along as
``Dixie'' was performed, but found their seats during ``My Country,
'Tis of Thee.'' People at the meeting matter-of-factly told The
Jackson Clarion-Ledger that Lott was a member, and the state's
largest newspaper printed this without objection from the senator's
office.
</P>
<P>
   But in mid-December, the council _ and its relationship to Lott,
who is shepherding the impeachment trial of President Clinton _
became the object of a growing national controversy.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, during
testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on the impeachment
issue, took umbrage at a remark by Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., about
``real Americans,'' taking it as anti-Semitic. He then attacked
Barr for speaking at a national meeting of the council, which he
described as racist. Then The Washington Post reported that Lott
had also addressed the group. Both men issued statements distancing
themselves from the council. Lott said he was not a member.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's initial statement said he did not consider himself a
member and had ``no firsthand knowledge of the group's views.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups,
issued a report Dec. 18 contending that the council, which it
described as having 15,000 members in 22 states was ``the
incarnation of the infamous white Citizens Councils,'' which helped
enforce segregation in Mississippi and other Southern states in the
1950s and '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The CCC has tried for years to pass itself off as a
respectable, mainstream organization,'' said Joe Roy, director of
the center's Intelligence Project. ``But the fact is, this group is
shot through with white supremacist views, members and political
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Potok, the Law Center's spokesman, added that the old white
Citizens Councils were ``the white-collar Ku Klux Klan,'' noting
that they were composed of respected local business and civic
leaders and government officials who sometimes backed violence,
including murder, against blacks seeking civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The white Citizens Council, formed to battle the Supreme Court's
1954 school desegregation ruling, was once Mississippi's most
powerful political machine, reaching its height in the early 1960's
with the election of Gov. Ross Barnett. It raised thousands of
dollars for the defense of a supporter, Byron De La Beckwith, who
was convicted in 1994 of murdering civil rights leader Medgar Evers
31 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Minor, dean of Mississippi journalists who has long
followed the race issue, said the Council of Conservative Citizens
was ``the reincarnation of the white Citizens Council.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord, the council's state coordinator was a white Citizens
Council organizer during the struggle over civil rights and told
The Jackson Clarion-Ledger in 1994 that he used the old white
Citizens Council mailing lists to set up the new organization.
Gordon Baum, a St. Louis lawyer who is the group's chief executive
officer, was a Midwest field organizer for the white Citizens
Council. The new organization was formed at a 1985 meeting in
Atlanta of a group of about 30 men distressed, Baum said, ``at the
lack of conservative organizations on the local level, where the
rubber hits the road.'' He added, ``These conservative talking
heads in Washington are just living in baronial splendor, taking
people's money.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men insisted, in telephone interviews, that the group was
not ``racist,'' but concerned with a range of conservative issues.
But nearly every column or article in its quarterly newspaper, The
Citizens Informer, is concerned with race.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``No one can deny the importance of the question of
miscegenation or race-mixing,'' Robert B. (Tutt) Patterson, a
founder of the original white Citizens Council and a regular
columnist, wrote in last fall's issue. ``Its very essence involves
the preservation of the white race as well as the Negro race. It is
a matter of racial survival. Compared with the future interest we
have at stake in this issue, all other matters fade into
insignificance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Western civilization, with all its might and glory, would
never have achieved its greatness without the directing hand of God
and the creative genius of the white race,'' Patterson wrote. ``Any
effort to destroy the race by a mixture of black blood is an effort
to destroy Western civilization itself. To deny this is to deny all
history.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the Mississippi council's major events is the Black Hawk
rally, held in Carroll County before elections every four years and
a mandatory stop for most politicians seeking statewide or county
office. It was originally a fund-raiser for the white Citizens
Council, but is now used to raise money for the all-white Carroll
Academy, which was set up to avoid desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   Lord, the events organizer, said Lott had appeared at the last
two rallies.
</P>
<P>
   A black state legislator, Rep. Willie Perkins, a Democrat whose
district crosses several counties around Greenwood, said in a
telephone interview that he had been invited to the last event in
1995, but refused to attend because ``it takes you back to the days
of the Klan.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Lott gave the keynote speech to a semiannual national
board meeting of the council in Greenwood. The account in The
Citizens Informer said he wound up by saying: ``The people in this
room stand for the right principles and the right philosophy. Let's
take it in the right direction and our children will be the
beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1997, a smiling Lott was pictured in The Citizens
Informer in his Washington office with Baum, the council's
executive officer, Lord, the state organizer, and Tom Dover, the
group's president.
</P>
<P>
   Literature distributed by the council cites endorsements by a
number of conservative politicians, including Fordice; Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C.; the voluble Boston City Councilman Albert L.
(Dapper) O'Neil, and former Georgia Gov. Lester Maddox, who was
noted for distributing souvenir ax handles as symbol of his method
of dealing with people trying to integrate his Atlanta-area
restaurant in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement attributed to Lott says, ``America needs a
national organization to mobilize conservative, patriotic citizens
to help protect our flag, Constitution and other symbols of
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's newspaper column, which is distributed by his office as a
release, is also a regular feature of The Citizen Informer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a rather large organization in Mississippi,'' Baum said,
sounding somewhat aggrieved at the slight. ``I would assume someone
as astute as Mr. Lott would have a pretty good grasp of us.''

HE WAS BETTER THAN ADVERTISED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's an observation you probably haven't digested before:
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan was underrated.
</P>
<P>
   We'll pause while a loved one unleashes the Heimlich on you and
your morning bagel. All clear? Good, those sesame seeds can be
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Back to business. Jordan ... underrated? Whew.
</P>
<P>
   But this is serious. Not to mention first-glance preposterous.
After all, aren't even the most pedestrian hoop citizens convinced
that MJ could take God to the rack without the aid of a pick?
Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   And isn't ESPN beaming out separate Jordan highlight loops,
categorically filed as ``Right-handed Poster Dunks,'' ``Two-Handed
Face Jams'' and ``Dirty Daggers Jabbed Into The Hearts Of Teams
Located In Cities Whose Names Begin With The Letter C''? Yeah,
that's hour one. Hour two is ``Cold-Blooded, Series-Ending
Jumpers.''
</P>
<P>
   Columnists spent much of Tuesday clawing toward poetic salvation
to define Jordan's status as the greatest basketball player in the
history of basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   We're wondering if they really were aware of what they had been
witnessing.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was so much more than cobra-strike dunks and
double-clutch smooches off the glass.
</P>
<P>
   He was the superstar who made Bulls fans believe his coach, Phil
Jackson, was a New Age genius who could walk on bong water.
</P>
<P>
   He was the visiting icon who inspired fans to boo the home team.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was the defender who stalked the opposing squad's
offensive sharpie and sent him to the hoosegow without chance of
parole.
</P>
<P>
   He was the Bull who would set a bitterly effective and nearly
legal screen, using his mitts to discreetly hold up the opponent
with a subtlety that could make Tony Boselli weep.
</P>
<P>
   He was the offensive rebounder handing out ulcers when a
teammate prepared to launch a free throw that had the potential to
chip paint off the rim.
</P>
<P>
   Could the man pass? Well, Jordan could drop a dime on the
offensively challenged Dennis Rodman and get an answer on the first
ring.
</P>
<P>
   Competitive? Looking like a casting mistake from George Romero's
``Dawn Of The Dead,'' he starred in ``One Flu Over The Delta
Center'' during the NBA Finals of 1997. After providing the
game-clinching jump shot, he had to be carried to the bench by
Scottie Pippen, who was more than glad to finally return the favor.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was the one who coaxed six championships from teams that
weren't afforded the requisite luxuries of point guard and center.
The alleged point guards were John Paxson and Ron Harper, two solid
Chicago heroes who couldn't create a shot for Jordan in a Nintendo
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   The centers were Bill Cartwright and Luc Longley. Don't ask.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentally sound? His footwork was worth a measure of
hyperbole that includes references to Gregory Hines and an alley
cat.
</P>
<P>
   Visibility? Thanks to Jordan, little kids know Ahmad Rashad is
more than just the real-life husband of Claire Huxtable.
</P>
<P>
   He may not have been the best shooter, or passer, or dunker or
rebounder in NBA history. But he could be all of those including
the best perimeter defender of all-time on the very next play.
</P>
<P>
   Will there ever be another Michael Jordan? Yeah. Plays for Penn
in the Ivy League. Check it out; Michael Jordan. That's as close as
it'll get.
</P>
<P>
   I once asked Michael Jordan, the retired one, if he could guard
himself. Wow. Deep.
</P>
<P>
   His response was a look that exposed me as someone who was
stark, raving mad.
</P>
<P>
   See, above and beyond everything else that defined basketball
player Michael Jordan, he also was painfully wise.

 &HT;    Barr's part in history
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From his desk, Rep. Bob Barr gazes at an etching on
the wall that depicts a scene from the last impeachment trial of a
president 131 years ago, and heaves a deep sigh.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, when Barr stumbled across the Harper's Weekly image
from the 1868 trial of President Andrew Johnson, he hardly could
have imagined that one day hewould take part in the trial of a
president.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Republican is one of 13 House impeachment managers
who will present the case against President Clinton beginning
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``My eyes are frequently drawn to that picture,'' said Barr, who
notes that the etching has been hanging in his office since he came
to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am about to participate in only the second impeachment trial
in our history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly brings the weight of history down on my
shoulders, and I think ahead 130 years from now, will people look
at the pictures that will be taken of our presentations and wonder
what it was like? Hopefully they will look back on history and
agree that we did a very credible and appropriate job.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican leadership appears to approve of Barr's job
so far. On the eve of the impeachment hearings, Majority Whip Tom
DeLay (R-Texas) rewarded Barr by naming him one of several dozen
assistant whips to help him gather votes to pass legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am deeply honored that Tom DeLay, one of the most effective
and courageous legislators in Congress, has chosen to appoint me,''
said Barr.
</P>
<P>
   But as Barr helps prepare the House case that attempts to prove
Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice in concealing an
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, he finds his
own conduct being questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Barr has angered more than one senator with his sharp criticism
of the Senate for its reluctance to call witnesses to support the
House managers' case. At one point, he suggested that ``a senator's
attention span is probably less than an average juror's, so we'll
need to simplify, simplify, simplify.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt with his
rapid-fire accusations that Barr is a hypocritical critic of the
president because the legislator invoked a state law similar to the
Fifth Amendment in refusing to answer questions on whether he had
an affair with Jerilyn Ann Dobbin, who is now his wife, while he
was married to his second wife, Gail Vogel Barr.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt also said Barr paid $300 for Gail Barr to have an abortion
in 1983 when they were still married, despite Barr's strongly held
views against abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Barr will not answer specific questions about whether he had an
affair with Dobbin before marrying her. However, he said, ``as an
officer of the court for over 20 years, I have never perjured
myself.'' As for the abortion, he says only that he never
``suggested, urged, forced, or encouraged anyone to have an
abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barr is not going underground in the wake of these
accusations; in fact, he appeared on CNN three times on Tuesday
night to deny Flynt's charges.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the controversy seems to have energized him. The
only pause he has taken since the Flynt episode was a trip to the
National Gallery on Monday afternoon to reflect on the expansive
panoramas of Albert Bierstadt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look and just sort of be drawn into them,'' Barr said.
``I think you get a good sense for the majesty of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Given his reverence for nation, why is Barr so determined to
oust this president?
</P>
<P>
   ``Love for our country, for our Constitution and for our system
of holding public officials being accountable for their misdeeds in
office and abusing the public trust,'' said Barr, who successfully
prosecuted former Rep. Patrick Swindall, a fellow Georgia
Republican, for lying under oath to a grand jury in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Still the question persists: Why would Barr criticize Clinton
for his personal conduct when he knew there might be questions
asked about his own conduct?
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern with the president is not his own personal
behavior,'' Barr said. ``My concern with the president is his abuse
of office, obstruction of justice, perjury in his capacity of
president, (and) working to deny one of our citizens her day in
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has nothing to do with his personal behavior. It has
nothing to do with anyone's personal behavior. It has to do with
his capacity as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr sees the charges by Flynt as politically motivated, an
effort to deflect attention away from the White House by sullying
the reputation of a hard-working congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very distressing that this sort of thing goes on, but
that's the administration we are dealing with. One has to move on,
press on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barr's role during the Senate trial will include crafting a
summary of legal precedents concerning perjury and obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be armed with plenty of precedents,'' the congressman
said. For example, Barr said, he has found precedent to bolster his
argument that a person, such as Lewinsky, does not have to be
directly asked to lie in order to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   Barr believes that case law will support his notion that the
president used Lewinsky to obstruct justice even though Lewinsky
has testified under oath that no one ever asked her to lie and no
one ever promised her a job in exchange for silence about her
affair with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to get too bogged down in detail that we lose
the forest from the trees,'' Barr said. ``But we want to show there
is legal and factual basis to convict the president of perjury and
obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators say they are not surprised by Barr's
criticisms. ``He's a very bright guy with a lot of experience in
trial law,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). ``He can't be ignored
but on the other hand he's got to make his case to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) noted it is Barr's nature to be
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   And that is how Barr sees it, too. He has to go after those who
go after him, such as Flynt.
</P>
<P>
   ``One always has to put up with charges in the political arena
whenever you attempt to hold a public official accountable,'' he
said. ``Whether it's a member of Congress or a county commissioner,
one has to look at the (source) of those sort of attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to tell if the attacks are inappropriate is to look at
the history of those involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have a history,'' he said, ``a history of pursuing
misconduct whether it's Republican, Democrat, black or white.''

 &HT;    100 jurors unite to judge Clinton
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They are unlike any jury in U.S. justice.
Ninety-one men and nine women, 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats.
Together the 100 members of the Senate will decide the fate of
President Clinton in the only presidential impeachment trial of
this century.
</P>
<P>
   Sworn to do ``impartial justice,'' the men and women of the
Senate nonetheless arrive at their rendezvous with history with a
complicated overlay of competing political ambitions and personal
biases.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, each will have only one vote in determining whether
Clinton should be impeached, but there are a few dozen senators to
pay close attention to as the trial gets under way Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Trent Lott
</P>
<P>
   Famous among his colleagues for his obsession with smooth
scheduling, Mississippi Republican Lott has the trial's most
difficult balancing act.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal Senate rules, the majority party can block
legislation, or filibuster, with only 40 votes. Under impeachment
trial rules, however, any motion is adopted by simple majority.
</P>
<P>
   Holding together 51 senators on procedural votes will be Lott's
toughest challenge. Democrats need only six Republicans to say
they've had enough of the trial and move to adjourn the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, the 81-year-old former Democratic majority leader and
author of a four-volume history of the Senate, is entering his 40th
year in the Senate. The West Virginian is keenly respected in both
parties both because of his longevity and his intimate knowledge of
Senate history and tradition. It was Byrd who set the tone last
week when Democrats and Republicans brokered a bipartisan beginning
to the trial, exhorting his colleagues to lance ``this boil in an
honorable and orderly way.''
</P>
<P>
   Look for Byrd to make many of the procedural motions on how the
trial should be conducted. It will be difficult for most other
senators to vote the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever he has to, he rises to the occasion,'' said Sen. Pete
Domenici (R-N.M.). ``He does so without partisanship. He cares
about the Senate more than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast moderates
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Republican moderates from the Northeast may hold
the key to how hard the Senate pushes to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In this group, the players to watch are Sens. John Chafee, whose
home state of Rhode Island is among the most Democratic in the
country; Jim Jeffords (R-Vt.), who said this week he wants the
trial to end ``as soon as possible''; and Sen. Olympia Snowe
(R-Maine), who was part of a bipartisan group of senators searching
for trial ground rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Chafee) starts getting antsy about the length of the
trial, he'll make it known it could have an impact on other
moderates from the Northeast,'' said Ed Gillespie, a Republican
strategist.
</P>
<P>
   Two others would normally vote with the Northeast moderates on
most issues, but so far have taken a tough line against the
president: Susan Collins (R-Maine), who was one of Clinton's
harshest critics during the Senate campaign finance hearings, and
Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), a former federal prosecutor and member of
the Senate Judiciary Committee who has demanded a full-scale Senate
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Western senators
</P>
<P>
   While Republican moderates from the Northeast form the smallest
grouping within the Senate Republican Party, conservatives from the
West and South form the heart and, in most respects, its governing
soul.
</P>
<P>
   This group of conservative ideologues objected most strongly to
the bipartisan proposal floated and then abandoned by Lott to hold
an abbreviated trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.), the majority whip, is at the center
of this band of Western, conservative senators. Nickles is one of
the Senate's most outspoken critics of Clinton and draws his
political support from many conservative organizations that have
called for Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Other strong conservatives include Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.),
Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.), Sen. Larry
Craig (R-Idaho), Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) and Sen. Chuck Hagel
(R-Neb.).
</P>
<P>
   Although these conservatives do not dictate the will of the
Republican conference, ``you can move away from them on either
side, but not too far away and not too fast,'' said Gillespie.
</P>
<P>
   The Class of 2000
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the year of the Republican revolution, voters in
Democratic-leaning states swept into office a handful of young
conservatives who are now up for re-election in 2000. They will be
under political pressure to moderate their rhetoric in the
impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   Most notable in this group is Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.), who
led the Senate fight against late-term abortions and who has been a
scathing Clinton critic. Lately, however, Santorum has been much
more circumspect about his comments on Clinton and impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the most passionate reflection of the class of '94,''
said Kyle McSlarrow, former chief of staff to Sen. Paul Coverdell
(R-Ga.) and a former aide to senator Bob Dole. ``As Santorum goes,
so goes that class.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican senators up for re-election in 2000 who come
from Democratic-leaning states include Sen. Rod Grams (R-Minn.) and
Sen. Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.).
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, there are no Democrats who believe the
president's misconduct rises to the level of impeachment, according
to Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), the minority leader. Several
Democrats, however, have nonetheless been publicly critical of
Clinton and would be among the first to support a strong motion of
censure.
</P>
<P>
   These include Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), Joseph
Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Bob Graham (D-Fla.). Lieberman was the
first Senate Democrat to condemn Clinton on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most politically vulnerable Democrat is Sen. Charles
Robb (D-Va.), who is up for re-election in 2000 and will face a
stiff Republican challenge from a state with strong conservative
leanings. Robb may be forced to toughen his position on the
president in the same way that Santorum and others are forced to
soften theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The president's strongest Democratic defenders are Sens. Richard
Durbin (D-Ill.), Bob Torricelli (D-N.J.) and Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.).
</P>
<P>
   The deal-makers
</P>
<P>
   Should the Senate begin to negotiate an early end to the trial
or work out the terms of a censure agreement, look for Sen. Ted
Stevens (R-Alaska), Appropriations Committee Chairman, and Sen.
Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
to play key roles.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.), who has spoken repeatedly of the
need for bipartisanship in the Senate trial, will be one of the key
Democratic players in any compromise, along with Sen. Carl Levin
(D-Mich.) and Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Any deal also will have to enjoy the blessings of Lott and
Daschle.

 &HT;    Deliberations have appeal of wreck you rubberneck
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You'll watch.
</P>
<P>
   You say you won't, but chances are you will. You've told
pollsters you think there shouldn't even be an impeachment trial
(84 percent, Time/CNN poll), that you want the trial to end
immediately (59 percent), that events in Congress are out of
control (74 percent).
</P>
<P>
   But you'll watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know from listening to traffic reports the thing that
slows traffic down is rubbernecking; you're in a hurry, yet you see
this incredible sight and can't help but turn your neck that way,''
Bill Moody, news vice president at Fox News Channel, says of the
contradiction between public fatigue with the Clinton story and the
story's high viewership levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all on the highway of impeachment; we're on Im-
peachment Road. Even though our spiritual souls are sickened by
this stuff, we are oddly and grotesquely interested in it.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll watch. You've watched all along. In 1998, live stories
and specials on CNN that dealt with the Clinton scandal averaged
three times more viewers than usually watched CNN. The network's
two highest-rated programs last year were scandal-related:
Clinton's Aug. 17 address to the nation after his grand jury
testimony (5.4 million households, 10th most watched event ever on
CNN, excluding 1991's Gulf War coverage) and Clinton's Dec. 19
address after Congress voted to impeach him (5.3 million
households).
</P>
<P>
   CNBC's prime time ratings rose 75 percent in 1998, mostly
powered by the all-Clinton scandal coverage on ``Hardball with
Chris Mathews,'' whose '98 viewership more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   All this despite a Pew Research Center poll that found only 36
percent of you have followed the Clinton/Lewinsky investigation
closely _ 3 percent fewer than followed stories of ``unseasonable
weather.''
</P>
<P>
   And the more distasteful it gets, the more you dislike it and
the more you watch. Porn publisher Larry Flynt's appearance Monday
on CNBC's ``Rivera Live'' was the highest-rated ``Rivera'' (1.2
million households) since coverage of O.J. Simpson's civil trial
verdict almost two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   You have your limits, however: On Dec. 19, CBS was the only
network not to televise the first House of Representatives vote to
impeach a president in 130 years. Instead, CBS televised a pro
football game, and got the day's highest ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's sure how many of you will watch this story's endgame,
beginning this afternoon; despite the Senate trial's historic
tonnage, its decorum could make it less visually dramatic than
other high-profile trials and hearings (Simpson, Anita Hill). Much
depends on whether witnesses are called, which ones, and whether TV
can show the deliberations, which it is now prohibited from doing
(the networks have petitioned the Senate to amend that rule).
</P>
<P>
   ``Levels will be very high, but it's hard to say how high,'' CNN
spokesman Howard Polskin says. ``We're in such unknown territory.
''
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching evidence being presented to 100 impartial jurors and
one chief justice is not the same as a pie-throwing contest,'' says
Moody, adding, ``But it's wrong to compare shock values; there have
been other hearings, but there has never been this. Maybe that
helps explain the apparent contradiction (between the public's
Clinton scandal weariness and high viewership).
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, (people) are tired of the thong and the cigar and seedy
parts of this drama. But they are also Americans with a sense of
their own country's history being written, and they can be live
spectators.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll watch.

LEAGUE IS LEFT GASPING FOR AIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   That sucking sound you hear is all of the Air being drained out
of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   A league that recently celebrated its 50th birthday with a
series of parties suddenly feels much older. It feels older than
Chick Hearn. It feels paralyzed. Its mind is seriously confused,
unable to remember where it's been and absolutely petrified about
where it's going.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan left opponents with those kind of feelings
throughout his career, so it's poignant that his decision to retire
now leaves the entire league gasping.
</P>
<P>
   This was going to happen eventually, so the NBA certainly can't
say it didn't have time to prepare. Every one of Jordan's road
games last season was billboarded as potentially his last visit to
(fill in the city).
</P>
<P>
   NBC promoted every ``last'' Jordan moment there was down the
stretch a season ago his last regular season game, his last playoff
game against Indiana, his last game in Chicago, his last game with
Spike Lee courtside, on down to his last penetrating, insightful
interview with Ahmad Rashad.
</P>
<P>
   Now that MJ-Day is here, the NBA will have to take stock of
what's left and find a way to move on. It's not going to enjoy the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Take Jordan away from the game and seriously study the league's
growth and you come away numb by exactly what he has meant to the
league, not to mention television and sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   During the 50th anniversary celebrations, the league got warm
and fuzzy about the league's early years, the 950s and 1960s, when
first George Mikan and then the Celtics were the headliners. It was
safe to do, in large part because there were few people around who
actually remembers those eras.
</P>
<P>
   For example: In 1969, the year the Celtics won their 11th title
in a 13-year span, the league's average attendance was 6,484 per
game.
</P>
<P>
   Think about that. The Celtics were as dominant in basketball as
the Yankees in baseball and the Canadiens in hockey. Their
opponents at the time featured Hall of Famers like Jerry West, Wilt
Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor, Earl Monroe, Oscar Robertson, Jerry
Lucas, Willis Reed, Walt Frazier, Lenny Wilkens and Nate Thurmond.
</P>
<P>
   And the average was 6,484. There are WNBA teams which consider
6,484 a bad crowd.
</P>
<P>
   NBA box office grew slowly the next seven years as it expanded
to 18 teams, then hit a plateau of around 10,000 a game in the late
'70s. Then, in the 1979-80 season, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson
arrived from the college ranks, put a smile on the game and gave
the sport its first real burst of energy since the Celtic era.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers and Celtics won eight of nine NBA titles between
1979-80 and 1987-88, and their battles are treasured as the most
memorable and aesthetic in league history. This was the NBA at its
absolute best.
</P>
<P>
   But here's what is so odd: while Bird and Magic are credited as
the league's saviors, they did not impact league-wide attendance.
The league's average per game stayed flat from 1975-76 to 1983-84.
The high during those nine years was 11,017 in Magic and Bird's
rookie year. The low was 10,021 in 1980-81.
</P>
<P>
   The league really did not gather its momentum until the late
'80s after Bird and Magic had won their last titles when Jordan
fully emerged as the best player the game has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the year he won his first scoring title, the league
average went up to 12,795 per game. In 1988, the first year the
Bulls and Jordan had a winning season, it jumped to 13,419.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the league average attendance for 25 clubs passed
15,000 (15,088), and it hasn't looked back since. The league has
drawn 21 million fans each of the last three seasons, an average of
more than 17,000 per game, all coinciding with the second of
Jordan's pair of three-peats.
</P>
<P>
   All this doesn't even begin to detail what Jordan has meant as a
TV vehicle, either. The NBA's Nielsen ratings during the '90s
dominate the all-time list. The Magic/Bird-to-Jordan era spotlights
one revealing note: The league didn't televise every game of its
finals live until 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The league is not going to drown without Jordan as its captain.
The league has grown to 29 cities, and most of them are sound. Only
four of 29 teams last season averaged under 14,000 fans a game
Dallas, Golden State, Denver and our erstwhile Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The new labor agreement David Stern just stuffed down the
union's throat will not leave any player feeling like a pauper, but
it will cap salaries and potentially engender warm feelings from
fans fed up with athlete earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But just as clearly, there is no one to replace Jordan in any
respect. There's no one out there capable of leading his team to
six NBA titles, no one capable of drawing fans to a television set,
no one who can move as smoothly both on- and off-court.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Hill? Great person. Capable of leading his team to a
title. On-court dynamic? He doesn't have one.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant? Great kid. Anxious to fill any shoes Jordan or
anyone else leaves behind. He may be the only player capable of
having the same on-court dynamic. Drawback? He's 20. It took Jordan
five years in the league to become the player that people remember
today, and he was 26.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal? He's capable of being a leader; after all, he
grew up the son of a Marine. But Shaq is having too much fun to get
serious about what it means to be a Magic- or Jordan-like figure.
Jordan played golf to relax. Shaq raps and acts. He's a cross-over
stud, but that doesn't play when the games begin.
</P>
<P>
   The scarier thing is to look at the names of prominent NBA
players now and find an easy connection to the league in the late
'70s, pre-Bird and Magic.
</P>
<P>
   The league title those seasons rotated around to a handful of
non-descript teams, like Golden State (1975), Portland (1977),
Washington (1978) and Seattle (1979). At the same time, the league
was flush with prominent characters who would have fit in a Hunter
S. Thompson novella free spirit Bill Walton, Marvin ``Bad News''
Barnes, Artis Gilmore, David Thompson, World B. Free, Spencer
Haywood and Connie Hawkins. Tales of NBA life in the late '70s
focused as much on drug use as they did basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Well, 1999 sans-Jordan has a similar look. Charles Barkley,

WARNER BROS. PARTNERS WITH FORTUNECITY ON WEB SITE FOR FANS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. -- Warner Bros. announced Wednesday a major
cyberspace expansion, launching an ACMEcity.com site named after
the mythical company of its ``Road Runner'' cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   The site, a joint venture of Warner Bros. and Internet design
specialist FortuneCity, will allow users to create their own Web
pages using images and audio clips from Warner cartoons, TV shows
like ``Friends'' and music acts like Depeche Mode. ACMEcity has 14
community sites grouped into film, TV, music and comics-animation
but plans to add 50 more within its first year.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Butt, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, said the
approach is a logical way for Warner Bros. to exploit its fan base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We encourage companies to take this approach, because it makes
your fans into your allies,'' he added. ``It creates a ton of
goodwill since you're allowing your fan base to grow and prosper
rather than just sending the message that you want to milk the last
penny out of the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies sealed the deal with studio parent Time Warner
Inc. making an investment into FortuneCity and agreeing to supply
an impressive $100 million of marketing support during the next
five years. They said the partnership will develop hundreds of
sites within ACMEcity with content reviewed for
``community-zoning'' compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, which made the announcement a day after rival The Walt
Disney Co. launched its ambitious Go Network ``portal'' service,
has high hopes for the service. ``The collaborative result will be
the largest entertainment-oriented community on the Internet,
creating a protected environment that is safe for families and
advertisers alike,'' said Jim Moloshok, president of Warner Bros.
Online.
</P>
<P>
   Work on the project began four months ago with the arrival of a
dozen FortuneCity employees in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than going around saying you can't use this and
threatening to sue, the idea is to let the fans use what they
want,'' said Richard Jones, co-vice chairman of 2-year-old
FortuneCity. ``So, instead of clamping down, you're releasing their
creativity and the benefits are massive.''

 &HT;    6th District race draws candidates from other areas
 &HT;    By Steve Visser
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The race to replace Newt Gingrich drew two more
candidates Wednesday, neither of whom live in the 6th Congressional
District.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Jeffrey, 51, can claim a close affiliation with the
district that covers much of the north Atlanta suburbs. She teaches
at Kennesaw State University, although she went on unpaid leave
this week to campaign. She lives in Bartow County.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Clennon King Jr., 78, who also paid $4,101 to qualify,
hails from Dougherty County in South Georgia. In 1976, the
African-American minister applied for membership in
then-President-elect Jimmy Carter's segregated church, Plains
Baptist. A split in the congregation resulted.
</P>
<P>
   King has just moved back to Albany from Miami where he lived for
years, according to a friend, Lois Jones. King asked her to take
calls for him at her home, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Georgia boy ...but he's been in Miami a good while,''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The only residency requirement in a congressional race is that
the candidate be an inhabitant of the state when elected.
</P>
<P>
   Today is the last day to become a candidate in the nonpartisan
race. Johnny Isakson of Marietta, who is also the state school
board chairman, and Leigh Baier of Vinings qualified for the race
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Other potential candidates are John Frank Collins, a Republican
who lost the race for labor commissioner last year; Bruce Hatfield,
a Republican; Bruce Doublestein, a Gwinnett County GOP leader;
Democrat Tony Center; and Democrat Gary ``Bats'' Pelphrey, who lost
to Gingrich in November.
</P>
<P>
   The election will be held Feb. 23, but the last day for voters
to register is Friday.

 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ World stock markets shuddered on Wednesday in
response to another dose of emerging market turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's plan to effectively devalue its currency initially
deflated the confidence of stock investors in the United States and
abroad. But after a sharp selloff in the first half-hour of
trading, American stock prices rebounded steadily throughout the
day.
</P>
<P>
   As the morning light seeped into the canyons of Wall Street,
indications were that stocks would take a huge hit. Some market
analysts predicted losses of up to 400 points off the Dow Jones
industrial average. In early trading, the prices of financial
futures dropped as far as regulators allowed, and when equity
trading started at 9:30 a.m. everything appeared bleak. The Dow
dropped more than 250 points, or nearly 3 percent, in the first 30
minutes, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 114 points, almost 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as quickly as it came, the calamity was past. Recalling
that previous plunges spurred by foreign currency crises _ in Asia
in 1997 and in Russia last summer _ turned out to be significant
buying opportunities in U.S. stocks, investors dove in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, the mentality is to buy the dips,'' said Byron
Wien, chief U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. ``When it looked like this was not the beginning of a bear
market, people saw that Yahoo was down 70 points and decided to
take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign markets did not fare as well. European markets, which
fell sharply as Brazil unveiled its plan to loosen the trading
range for its currency, the real, were closed by the time the
Brazilian Congress adopted reform measures that to American
investors looked promising.
</P>
<P>
   While investors in the United States shunned shares of auto
makers, heavy equipment companies and banks that have business
links to Brazil, they snapped up stocks like Intel, Microsoft and
Sun Microsystems, whose earnings are not expected to be disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average finished the day down 125.12
points, or 1.3 percent, at 9351.10. Other American indexes recorded
smaller losses, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up more
than 8 points at one point. It finished the day down 5.11 at
1234.40.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think U.S. investors saw Brazil's actions as inevitable, and
now that it's behind us we can move forward,'' Wien said. ``Markets
have a funny way of reacting positively to reality once they think
it through.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, which ended the day down 34, at 368, has no operations in
Brazil, but the stocks of companies that do finished mostly lower
on Wednesday. Shares of Ford, General Motors and DaimlerChrysler
each fell by about 2 percent, while Caterpillar, the equipment
maker, International Paper and Coca-Cola shares also fell.
</P>
<P>
   Banking stocks suffered even more, as investors' recalled that
the last Latin American debt crisis caused longlasting problems for
money-center banks. J.P. Morgan's shares fell by 5 percent,
Citigroup declined 6 percent and American Express slumped nearly 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, investment analysts and portfolio managers said that
while they expect neither an extended nor a deep downturn from
Brazil's crisis, much uncertainty remains about that country's
fiscal plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is not the last adjustment that we will see to
the currency regime in Brazil,'' said Thomas Haslett, chief
investment officer for emerging market equities at Putnam
Investments, the mutual fund company. He noted, though, that
foreign companies doing business there have had plenty of warning
to hedge against a currency decline.
</P>
<P>
   Less certain is the spillover effect that Brazil's problems will
have on other markets in Latin America, Europe and the Far East.
Stock markets in those regions fell sharply on Wednesday, although
they could stabilize on Thursday in light of Wednesday's rebound in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN START HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's Bovespa stock market index fell 5 percent, with shares
of the 12 companies created by the breakup of Telebras, the giant
telecommunications concern, being among the market's biggest
losers. Four of the largest Telebras spinoffs operate with pricing
discretion that could offer them some protection from the inflation
that is now expected to rise in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's Bolsa index fell 4.6 percent, and the Argentina general
index tumbled 10 percent. Investors are likely to be closely
watching Argentina and Mexico, two of the region's other largest
economies, for signs of weakness in light of Brazil's problems.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the uncertainty, Latin America is going to have a
higher cost of capital,'' said Haslett. ``A relatively small amount
of support should be able to carry Argentina through 1999.'' And
Mexico should benefit from a continued strong economy in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, stock prices fell sharply, 3 percent in Britain and 4
percent in Germany. The region's economy has already suffered from
slowing exports to Asia and Eastern Europe, and could feel a
further pinch from Brazil's trouble. Volkswagen, for example, is
among the biggest car producers in Brazil. Spanish banks have also
lent heavily in Brazil, which led investors to push Spanish stock
prices down nearly 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices also fell in Asia, although those losses came well
before Brazil unveiled its currency plans. Hong Kong stock prices
fell by 4 percent, while Japan ended slightly higher on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Asian currency crisis of 1997 or last year's economic
emergency in Russia, the current situation in Brazil carries more
importance for American investors. Brazil dominates the economies
of South America, accounting for 40 percent of the continent's
output. And investors can watch the effects of the crisis unfold in
real time.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Asian currency crisis began in the summer of 1997,
financial analysts have postulated that Brazil _ which like
Thailand, Indonesia and other emerging market countries had pegged
the value of its currency to the American dollar _ might come under
pressure to devalue the real.
</P>
<P>
   That concern was tempered somewhat by the International Monetary
Fund's move in November to put together a ``precautionary'' loan
package totaling $41 billion. The IMF has been criticized for
responding too slowly in Asia and for attaching overly harsh
austerity conditions to its loans there.
</P>
<P>
   Now Brazil could benefit from what has been learned elsewhere.
``There is a very strong possibility that this will be one of the
turning points,'' said David Herro, manager of the Oakmark
International fund, a $800 million fund that has about 9 percent of
its assets invested in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the fund had hedged most of its holdings against
losses caused by currency declines and that he was adding to some
of those positions during the day's weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Herro also dismissed parallels between Brazil's woes and last
year's turmoil in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is free-market oriented and is run by some smart
people,'' Herro said. ``And unlike Mexico's crisis in 1994, Brazil
has no problem with short-term debt or its currency reserves.''
</P>
<P>
   When emerging markets recover from currency problems, they tend
to do so quickly. Witness some of the Asian emerging markets, which
soared last year after falling sharply in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the reaction of American investors, the crisis in
Brazil appeared to be over almost before it started. Some stocks
rose from Wednesday's opening bell: Ascend Communications, for
example, gained 5] to 80 5/16 after Lucent Technologies agreed to
buy the company for $19.7 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Intel fell at the opening even though the company
reported fourth-quarter earnings late Tuesday that beat analysts'
estimates. Investors soon decided that the drop was unwarranted and
sent the shares up 3 7/16 to 139.
</P>
<P>
   Investors bid up several other technology stocks as well. Sun
Microsystems gained 3 7/16 to 96 13/16, and traded as high as 104{.
Microsoft, which started its defense in the ongoing federal
antitrust trial after losing a bid to get the charges dismissed,
rose 1| to 143 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Technology shares closely related to the Internet finished
generally lower. Amazon.com fell 15] to 148; America Online lost 7~
to 145}; and E Trade dipped 8 1/16 to 92~.

FRANCE, IN BREAK WITH U.S., URGES END TO IRAQ EMBARGO
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IRAQ-U.S.) 
 (nk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ France, making a formal break with the United
States and Britain, proposed Wednesday that the Security Council
lift the oil embargo on Iraq and institute a new weapons monitoring
system to prevent Saddam Hussein from rearming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The embargo has become the wrong tool to achieve the goals of
the Security Council,'' said the French proposal, which circulated
Wednesday to all Council members. ``It needs to be lifted.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States rejected most major points in the French
proposal in advance at a council discussion last month on Iraq.
Keeping Iraq under tight sanctions, including forbidding the
country to sell oil freely to raise money for arms, has been
central to American policy.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Wednesday that
the French proposals had ``some positive elements,'' including the
calls for continued arms monitoring and some supervision of oil
earnings. But he reiterated the American position that sanctions
could not be lifted until Iraqi arms programs had been rendered
harmless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a number of questions and concerns that we are going
to address to France about the proposal,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The initial reaction from Iraq, which would have to agree to a
new monitoring system, was largely negative. Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan said at a news conference that such proposals,
including similar ideas floated by Saudi Arabia, ``carry conditions
that lead to exchanging 8-year-old sanctions with a new embargo.''
</P>
<P>
   The French said in their plan that the oil embargo could no
longer be defended, because ``it hurts the people of Iraq and keeps
them hostages of their authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   France proposes lifting only the oil embargo initially, leaving
in place other sanctions like a ban on international air travel.
Other sanctions would be removed only if the Iraqis demonstrate
cooperation and compliance with new rules. Conversely, additional
sanctions could be imposed ``should Iraq not comply with its
undertakings and obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   The French propose replacing the arms inspection commission with
a ``renewed control commission'' that would have a preventive
rather than investigative role, watching for signs of illegal arms
use from existing stocks or attempts to buy or produce new
prohibited weapons. Long-term monitoring would replace intrusive
searches for evidence of past programs.
</P>
<P>
   Many tons of Iraqi weapons and ammunition have been destroyed
since the end of the Gulf War in 1991. But questions remain about
unaccounted materiel like biological and chemical stocks and the
missiles to deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq was also found to have had a secret nuclear-weapons
program. But the International Atomic Energy Agency has said it can
find no evidence of arms or components to assemble them, a
conclusion that independent American arms experts challenge.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Using language heard frequently from Iraq and Russia, the French
proposal said that the control commission should ``have its
independence insured and it professionalism strengthened.'' In the
past those have been code words for shielding the inspections from
American influence or pressure and putting them under the United
Nations international Civil Service structure.
</P>
<P>
   Under the French proposal, which was first outlined on Tuesday
to other permanent members of the Security Council _ Britain,
China, Russia and the United States _ a financial surveillance
system would be devised to watch Iraqi expenditures from oil
profits.
</P>
<P>
   The plan does not call for an escrow account to keep the money
under supervision, as is now the case under the program that allows
Iraq to sell limited amounts of oil to buy food, medicine and other
goods needed to improve living standards.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers of Iraqi oil and the Iraqi government would have to
notify the U.N. Secretariat, not the Security Council, of each
sale. ``Oil flows should be controlled on the ground,'' the
proposal says.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of financial surveillance would be to compel Iraq to
meet its obligations to pay outstanding war claims and pay for a
new monitoring system from oil earnings without ``diverting these
resources for the reconstitution of weapons of mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The French are suggesting that all arms sales to Iraq be
prohibited and imports of other materials that could be used in
weapons development be policed and restricted. All other Iraqi
purchases could be made freely without surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has repeatedly said the oil embargo, the most
important of numerous economic sanctions imposed after the invasion
of Kuwait in 1990, cannot be lifted until the Iraqis have been
judged to have met all disarmament requirements set out in the 1991
cease-fire resolution after the gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Those requirements have not been met. Existing resolutions
governing them would, in effect, have to be annulled, a step that
could paralyze the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Although offering no proposals on salvaging the arms inspection
system carried out by the U.N. Special Commission, the American
delegation is expected to oppose monitoring methods that do not
allow intrusive inspections, even though the Clinton administration
did not press for them for much of last year.
</P>
<P>
   The French emphasize that their proposals are meant to generate
debate and some action in the Security Council, which has been
largely inert on the subject of Iraq since American and British
bombing raids last month effectively killed the existing inspection
system.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam has made it clear that the inspectors of the Special
Commission, who were withdrawn hours before the air strikes, will
never be allowed to return. Diplomats say they do not see how force
can reimpose the work of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Ramadan was unequivocal, saying, ``Any talk about the
future of the commission, whether it has to do with beautifying its
ugliness or to change one of its spies, its makeup or the role of
one of its members, we say, is a waste of time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Paris the French Foreign Ministry said it was impossible to
resurrect the Special Commission. ``France thinks that it is time
for the U.N. Security Council to consider that no progress can be
made by an illusory resumption of previous methods,'' a statement
from the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   The executive chairman of the commission, Richard Butler,
continues to argue that the agency, known as Unscom, is not dead,
and will have a new role to play in whatever system is ultimately
devised.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis will have to accept any plan imposed on them,
however. Saddam has always chafed at international controls, and
the French proposal maintains some significant ones.

 By STEVEN LEE MYERS c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American and Iraqi forces clashed in northern Iraq
for a third consecutive day Wednesday as Iraq's Vice President
vowed to defy American and British control of its skies ``with all
of our capabilities, regardless of the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   In what has become a pattern of cat-and-mouse confrontations,
American jets based in Turkey attacked five anti-aircraft and
surface-to-air-missile batteries in the northern no-flight zone
created by the United States and its allies in 1991 to protect
Iraq's Kurdish population, officials at the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   For now administration and Pentagon officials said they would
continue to exchange fire with the Iraqi air defenses, but they did
not rule out launching more aggressive, pre-emptive strikes by the
United States and Britain against Iraqi forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a credible and robust threat of force in the region if
we determine that that needs to be used,'' the president's press
secretary, Joe Lockhart, said at the White House Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which administration
officials have acknowledged was a factor in the timing of last
month's American and British raids on Iraq, ends this weekend with
the arrival of the new moon.
</P>
<P>
   There are indications that Iraqi forces are deliberately drawing
fire, one defense official said, in an attempt to find weaknesses
in American tactics that could allow Iraq to shoot down an American
or British jet.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's skirmishes, Pentagon officials said, Iraqi forces
fired at least one surface-to-air missile, but the missile failed
to hit any of the aircraft patrolling the no-flight zone in Iraq.
American and British officials said their jets returned safely to
their base in Incirlik, Turkey, even though Iraq claimed to have
shot down an ``enemy aircraft,'' as it has in previous exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Four American F-15E fighter jets then attacked two Soviet-era
surface-to-air missile sites near Mosul, the city in northern Iraq
that has been the center of a flurry of skirmishes over the last
two weeks. The officials said guided bombs dropped by those jets
scored ``direct hits.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same area, F-16 fighters and EA-6B electronic-jamming
jets fired three radar-seeking missiles at anti-aircraft sites,
also near Mosul, but the officials said it was not clear whether
those strikes had hit.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has tested the enforcement of the zones before, but never
in such a sustained way. Iraq's vice president, Taha Yassin
Ramadan, kept up Iraq's increasingly strident defiance Wednesday,
saying the zones violate Iraqi sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to confront this violation with all of our
capabilities, regardless of the cost,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   There is a cost to the United States, too. Each of the
radar-seeking missiles fired by the F-16s and EA-6B's costs about
$200,000, and those jets have already fired off nearly a dozen
missiles.

 &HT;    'Message from Conyers' makes television debut
 &HT;    By Peter Scott
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Supporters of Conyers, Ga., visionary Nancy Fowler are
taking to the airways to get the whole world praying for peace.
</P>
<P>
   In a satellite telecast beamed worldwide by HTV of Houma, La.,
an hourlong program called ``Message from Conyers'' made its debut
on Wednesday. The new program will air at 1 p.m. on the 13th of
each month.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 million viewers, primarily in Latin American
countries, are expected to watch the monthly broadcast from the
15-year-old station, Fowler supporters said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Folse, president of HTV and a primary backer of the
program, said he launched the broadcast in response to an appeal by
Fowler. When Fowler delivered what she called her last public
message on Oct. 13, she asked pilgrims worldwide to pray the rosary
for peace. The event drew about 80,000 people to her Conyers farm,
about 35 miles east of downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the cause,'' Folse said at a Wednesday news
conference to announce the new show. ``We volunteered the resource,
and we are not making any money on this. We may break even.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler did not attend Wednesday's news conference because she
was ill, said George Collins, one of her spokespersons. But Dr.
Ricardo Castanon and visionary Katya Rivas did attend.
</P>
<P>
   Castanon, a Bolivian neuropsychologist who was an atheist
skeptic of Fowler's claims, says he and others have proved her
claims exist, and they have submitted papers to the Vatican for
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Rivas, who says she now receives messages from the Virgin Mary,
urged all to ``live the life of the Spirit.'' Through an
interpreter, she said the world should know that ``the Father is
full of love, and do not fear me. How much do I love you? I have
sacrificed my son,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's program included about 20 minutes of prayers and an
interview that included Fowler and others associated with the
visions she said she began receiving in the early 1990s. Fowler
discussed a 1993 vision of Chinese soldiers occupying American
soil. She told her interviewer that the vision disturbs her because
she has since learned that Taiwan and China have bid for the
greatest economic influence in the Panama Canal, which the United
States will relinquish Dec. 31. She said the Chinese also have
bragged about their ability to take out American global
surveillance satellites.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The gunman, undeterred by the bright daylight of a
Mexico City morning, strode up to the sedan parked on a bustling
street and fired one bullet from an automatic pistol, shattering
the driver's window and killing Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, one of
Mexico's most prominent politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Within months of the assassination, on Sept. 28, 1994, the
investigation turned into a crucial test of Mexico's justice
system. Prosecutors appointed by a new president arrested the
eldest brother of a former president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
and charged him as the mastermind of the murder. Never before had a
close relative of a figure as powerful as a former president faced
prosecution for so grave a crime.
</P>
<P>
   But after four years, the sensational trial of the brother, Raul
Salinas de Gortari, has taken so many bizarre turns that it has
done little to dispel the notion that Mexico's high and mighty
enjoy exceptional impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the judge set to rule, a compelling new piece of
evidence implicating Raul Salinas that was never presented in court
has emerged. It is a tape recording of the very first police
interrogation of Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez, who assembled the
assassination team and is serving 37 years in jail as an accomplice
to murder.
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong recording is significant because it appears to be
free of the manipulation and coercion by the police and prosecutors
that so fouled other evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez Gonzalez, 48, was the first witness to give the police
a broad depiction of how the murder was planned and carried out.
Although much of what he says about the Salinas family is hearsay,
he gave a surprisingly fluid account 36 hours after the shooting in
which he described the plot in details only an insider could
possess _ most of which were confirmed in later investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez Gonzalez affirmed repeatedly that it was Raul Salinas
who gave orders ``to eliminate'' Ruiz Massieu, a fast-rising
politician who was the secretary general of Mexico's dominant
political party and had once been married to the Salinases' sister,
Adriana.
</P>
<P>
   And in allegations that were never followed up, Rodriguez
Gonzalez insists _ five times _ that Raul Salinas Lozano, the
father of Raul, Carlos and Adriana, who was once a power in Mexican
politics, also knew of and approved the murder of Ruiz Massieu, his
former son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   The tape was provided to The New York Times by a person who has
worked closely with Mexican officials in a number of crime
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Luis Ramos Rivera, a deputy attorney general who has
struggled for two years to stitch back together a homicide case
left in tatters by the two special prosecutors before him, said he
had not known about the tape. Why it never reached his hands is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This without a doubt is very important evidence,'' Ramos
Rivera said. ``The testimony was given only hours after the
killing, by a participant who knew all the details of the homicide
and makes no effort to hide his own role. It shows that the name of
Raul Salinas de Gortari was mentioned from the very first moments
of the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyer for Salinas, Eduardo Luengo Creel, said today
that he could not comment on the new tape because he is required to
remain silent in these final days of the trial, as the judge weighs
his verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he referred to comments he made in the past about a
different tape of Rodriguez Gonzalez that emerged in April 1997.
Luengo said he believes that tape was fabricated by the second
special prosecutor, Pablo Chapa Bezanilla, out of desperation
because he believed his case against Salinas was collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   Luengo has argued that Rodriguez Gonzalez and his brother,
Fernando, an accomplice, agreed beforehand they would blame the
Salinas family if they were caught. But the defense has never
explained what motive the Rodriguez Gonzalez brothers may have had.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Raul Salinas de Gortari has maintained that
he is not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared, haggard and despondent, at the final hearing in his
trial on Dec. 9 in a courtroom at the grim Almoloya penitentiary,
where he has been confined since his arrest on Feb. 28, 1995.
Flanked by his nieces Claudia and Daniela Ruiz Massieu, the
daughters of the man whose murder he is accused of ordering, Raul
Salinas broke into tears as he asserted his innocence once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``My imprisonment in Almoloya responds more to a political
decision than a legal one,'' Salinas said. ``Public lynching and
fabricated accusations are some of the many weapons that have been
used against our family, aside from bullets.''
</P>
<P>
   Salinas Lozano, who is 81 and severely ill with emphysema, did
not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. Salinas Lozano
has indignantly denied any part in the murder of a man he says was
a friend and family member. None of the prosecutors uncovered
sufficient evidence to call him for questioning in the case.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed last week in a Mexico City prison, Jorge Rodriguez
Gonzalez recognized his voice on the tape. He said the questioning
took place on the evening of Sept. 29, 1994, the day after the
assassination, at a federal police headquarters in Matamoros, where
he lived and where he retreated after the killing. The location and
time are confirmed by statements on the tape.
</P>
<P>
   After Rodriguez Gonzalez's interrogation in Matamoros, he was
flown to Mexico City for questioning by detectives working for the
special prosecutor chosen by President Salinas to handle the murder
case. He testified later that the detectives beat him until they
broke one of his ribs to force him to eliminate any mention of Raul
Salinas from his testimony. The April 1997 tape discovered by Ramos
Rivera registered his agonized responses under that torture.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Rodriguez Gonzalez gave his first official deposition for
the court record after about 12 hours of harsh interrogation by the
Mexico City detectives. In contrast to the version he gave earlier
in Matamoros, where he mentioned Raul Salinas 11 times, he did not
refer even once to Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   President Carlos Salinas appointed the first special prosecutor,
who stands accused in Mexico of brutalizing several witnesses to
cover up Raul Salinas' role. A cruel paradox is that he was the
victim's own brother, Mario Ruiz Massieu, then a deputy attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned from the case after two months and after President
Salinas stepped down. He fled from Mexico in March 1995, but was
arrested in the United States. He vehemently denies that he tried
to protect Raul Salinas and has defeated four attempts by Mexico to
extradite him. He remains under house arrest in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   One mystery is where and how the decision was made to withhold
the first tape from Ramos Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   An American official who insisted on anonymity said a copy of
this tape was obtained by the United States Drug Enforcement
Administration over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   It should have set off alarm bells. Attorney General Janet Reno
had pledged to Salinas' successor, President Ernesto Zedillo, that
the United States would cooperate fully with Mexico's efforts to
extradite and prosecute Mario Ruiz Massieu in order to help solve
the killing of Jose Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But D.E.A. officials now deny that they know anything about the
tape. Van D. Quarles, a spokesman for the agency, said it ``does
not know of the existence of the tape, much less what's on it and
who's on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The tape can no longer be entered as evidence because the trial
is effectively over. Under the rigid procedures of Mexican justice,
the judge, Ricardo Ojeda Bohorquez, has until Jan. 22 to study the
trial record and issue his verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez said on the tape that he was led into
the assassination by his brother Fernando, 52, who has been
convicted as the organizer of the plot. Trial records show that
Fernando instructed the gunman how to recognize his victim and
arranged the ambush as Ruiz Massieu emerged from a Mexico City
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez acknowledged on the tape that he helped
his brother to find the assassin, a ranch hand from Tamaulipas
state. Jorge stood lookout as the killer, Daniel Aguilar Trevino,
shot Ruiz Massieu.
</P>
<P>
   On the tape, Rodriguez Gonzalez said he learned from his brother
that Raul Salinas de Gortari and his father were behind the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did [Fernando) tell you about the operation?'' asked the
police interrogator, as buzzers and police radios hummed in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just said that they gave orders from above that there was
going to be an operation,'' Rodriguez Gonzalez replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``What operation?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were going to eliminate a person who they did not want to
have around,'' Rodriguez Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who gave the orders from above?''
</P>
<P>
   ``As I understand it, what I heard there, was that Raul Salinas
de Gortari and his father were the ones who handled that,''
Rodriguez Gonzalez replied.
</P>
<P>
   A while later the interrogator asks, ``Why were they going to
kill him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because those were the instructions of Raul Salinas de Gortari
and his father,'' Rodriguez Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Later he explains tha his brother told him that Raul Salinas
promised to find government jobs for the murder conspirators. He
also says his brother told him after the killing that Raul Salinas
and his father were ``irritated'' by early reports that Ruiz
Massieu had been only wounded, not killed.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez said that Fernando heard that Raul
Salinas had pledged to find a way to free the gunman, Aguilar, who
was captured moments after the shooting by a bank security guard.
Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez also said Fernando even hinted at a
motive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left the sister of Raul Salinas; he left her for the reason
that he was a homosexual,'' saidJorge Rodriguez Gonzalez referring
to Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that why they want to kill him, because he was a
homosexual?'' an interrogator asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what problem they have inside the family, but the
father gave instructions,'' Rodriguez Gonzalez answered.
</P>
<P>
   Last week at the prison, Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez became
distraught and gave confused responses after hearing the tape. He
said that the police in Matamoros had beaten him before the
questioning began, an accusation he had not raised previously in
court. Then he said that the tape must have been fabricated because
he said he would not have implicated himself as he did on the
recording. After first admitting to his role in murder plot, he has
recently begun to assert that he had nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tape is 90 percent manipulated,'' Rodriguez Gonzalez
said, trying to steady his trembling hands. ``The one part that is
true is that I was told that Raul Salinas de Gortari was behind the
assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything he knew about Salinas' role he heard from his brother
Fernando, who in turn heard it from his boss, an ambitious
congressman from Tamaulipas named Manuel Munoz Rocha. The
prosecution alleges that Raul Salinas offered to lend Munoz Rocha
the political clout of a presidential sibling if he would ``take
care'' of Ruiz Massieu.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz Rocha, who is wanted for murder, disappeared one day after
the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   However, numerous details from Rodriguez Gonzalez's statements
were subsequently confirmed by documentary evidence. For example,
Jorge recounts that after the murder Fernando received a cellular
phone call from Munoz Rocha, who informed him that Ruiz Massieu was
dead, adding that he had called Raul Salinas at home to tell him
the news.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz Rocha, according to Rodriguez Gonzalez, ``even said they
told him that [Raul Salinas) was asleep, and he said, well, `Wake
up, brother, because it's done, it's over.'''
</P>
<P>
   Phone records presented in court show that Munoz Rocha made
several attempts to reach Raul Salinas' home on the day of the
murder. Later one of Salinas' bodyguards testified that he received
a phone call that day from Munoz Rocha but advised him that Salinas
was asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos Rivera, the current prosecutor, acknowledged that his case
against Raul Salinas is far from airtight. ``We inherited a case
that was full of incredible errors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most serious, in his view, were committed by the
second prosecutor, Chapa. After the first prosecutor was accused of
trying to suppress the role of Raul Salinas, Chapa reversed course,
making huge secret payments court documents showed to induce
several witnesses to implicate Raul Salinas, including $500,000 to
Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez. He fell in league with a clairvoyant
and with a former mistress of Salinas. Hoping to frame Salinas and
collect a reward that Chapa himself offered, the two women planted
a body on a ranch belonging to Raul Salinas, but the autopsy
results quickly exposed the scheme. Chapa fled to Spain, but when
he was arrested there, he agreed to return to Mexico for trial on
charges related to the illegal burial.
</P>
<P>
   The former prosecutor was acquitted of every charge.

 &HT;    Tax cut, transit initiative drive Barnes' first budget
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Roy Barnes set about fulfilling campaign promises
Wednesday with an $83 million property tax cut, new outside audits
of state agencies and a fresh approach to transportation planning
included in his $13.3 million state budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The spending plan, which covers the year beginning July 1, is
$760 million bigger than the current budget. It gives major boosts
to day care, alternative schools, law enforcement pay and the state
crime lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have managed to keep up with the demands of being the
fastest growing state in the South... without raising a single tax
or fee, while providing for a tax cut,'' Barnes told a joint
session of the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cut doubles the homestead exemption on homes and farms
to $4,000 of assessed value. During the next seven years, Barnes
plans to raise the exemption to $20,000 in assessed value _ or
$50,000 in market value _ saving property owners $630 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many young couples struggling to qualify for their first
home, and for many elderly couples on fixed incomes who are
fighting tooth and nail to stay in their homes, this tax cut will
help lift the burden and fulfill the dream of home-ownership,''
Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   The tax-cut plan has bipartisan support, though legislators are
curious to see how Barnes plans to ensure that local governments
are reimbursed for lost revenue.
</P>
<P>
   A homeowner whose property is assessed at the state average,
$31,418, would receive a $506 annual tax cut when the Barnes plan
is in full effect.
</P>
<P>
   The governor repeatedly touched on the theme that Georgia must
begin to deal with the negative effects of its rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I was born, a train ran from my hometown of Mableton to
this state Capitol every hour,'' Barnes said. ``But we pulled up
our rail lines for more and faster (highway) lanes, which are
slowing us down, snarling our growth and polluting our air.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor wants to spend $1 million to create the Georgia
Urban Transportation Management Authority to find new solutions to
traffic, sprawl and smog _ and commuter rail is likely to figure
prominently.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Tom Murphy, for one, is ready to listen. ``I've
changed my mind on rail transport,'' said Murphy, a Bremen
Democrat, who said he foresees Atlanta's MARTA commuter rail lines
extending out 40 to 50 miles within the next decade. ``We may have
to force people to do what they don't want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes promised details on the mechanics of his new
transportation authority in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Barnes' economic development program, the
$13.6 million Yamacraw Project, is an initiative to promote Georgia
as a mecca for the design of computer microchip systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want to do is produce the graduates, attract the
companies and market the products that make the information
superhighway work,'' Barnes said. ``We want to make the nuts and
bolts _ the silicon chips and semiconductors.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has also recommended issuing $220 million in bonds to
expand the Georgia World Congress Center, although that project
would be funded in his amended budget for fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The new governor's overall spending plan was well received by
the legislators who've been asked to adopt it.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Larry Walker (D-Perry) said the property
tax cut was long overdue. House Appropriations Chairman Terry
Coleman (D-Eastman) said he didn't see many sticking points likely
to trigger fierce opposition.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Bob Irvin (R-Atlanta) praised the
Democratic governor for seeking independent audits of major state
agencies. Republicans have pushed that idea for years, and Guy
Millner, Barnes' opponent in the governor's race, suggested it in
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' announcement that he wants to spend $4 million on the
audits drew the loudest applause during his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the real news of this budget,'' Irvin said. ``It
makes all the difference in the world to have outside auditors
instead of the state auditor. They have more freedom, less
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes also proposed establishing a special office of consumer
advocacy for insurance, a plan that is likely to come under attack.
One insurance lobbyist said it was a bad idea he and others would
oppose.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing decline in state welfare rolls gives Barnes $40
million to play with. He proposed using $30 million to expand state
child care programs to allow 14,706 additional children to be
served. The remainder of the savings also will be reinvested in
human services programs.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin endorsed that approach. ``I've always said the purpose of
welfare reform is not to save money, it's to save lives,'' the
legislator said.
</P>
<P>
   The Barnes budget includes $252 million for pay raises. Teachers
and college professors would get 4 percent raises, while other
state employees will get an average of 3 percent. Former Gov. Zell
Miller had given teachers four consecutive years of 6 percent
raises to raise their pay to the highest in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said his boost is sufficient to keep Georgia in first
place.
</P>
<P>
   The new governor also wants to nearly double state funds for
alternative schools, which provide a special place for disruptive
students. He would add $12.9 million to increase funding to $24.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes is asking for large increases in after-school programs
for children in grades 4 through 8 and in reading programs for
younger students.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to use $48.6 million to open new prisons and to staff
existing facilities, along with $86.1 million in state and federal
funds in his supplemental budget for 2,200 new prison beds. A $17.3
million increase in juvenile justice spending will help the state
make the improvements ordered last year by the U.S. Department of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes wants to raise the starting salaries for correctional
officers from $18,880 up to $22,000 and for state troopers from
$24,000 up to $26,000. He also proposes hiring 40 new troopers,
bringing the force to 929.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes recommended $6.4 million in new spending for the state
crime lab, which he called ``nothing short of a disaster.'' The new
money would fund 85 new positions, equipment and related expenses.

 The Wizard Can Boost Performance  &HT;       
 By David Einstein  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  How often should you use the Maintenance Wizard in
Windows 98? And is it really necessary to use it at all?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  The Maintenance Wizard is a tool that lets you
schedule three ``tune-up'' programs to run automatically when
you're away from your computer: Disk Cleanup, which deletes
unnecessary files, including temporary files; ScanDisk, which
checks and repairs minor problems on your hard drive; and Disk
Defragmenter, which organizes the data on the drive so that it can
be retrieved efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Of those programs, the only one that really helps increase
performance is the disk defragmenter. Over time, your disk can
become fragmented, meaning information about programs gets
scattered around the disk rather than all being in one location.
This can impair performance.
</P>
<P>
   Whether and how often you should run the Disk Defragmenter
depends on how heavily you use your PC. If all you do is surf the
Web, exchange e-mail and write letters, you may never have to
bother defragmenting. If, on the other hand, you are constantly
adding and deleting programs from your computer, you should
defragment every month or so.
</P>
<P>
   You can run any of the maintenance programs directly from the
System Tools folder in the Programs/Accessories menu. The advantage
of the Maintenance Wizard is that it lets you schedule them to run
at a time when you won't need the PC. That's especially important
for Disk Defragmenter, because defragmenting a large hard drive can
take several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for an inexpensive lot on which to build a
retirement home, and have found some affordable mountain land.
Though the site has nearby power lines, there are no plans for
telephone service in the near future. The land agent I am dealing
with assures me that many people now have Internet connections via
radio frequency (rf), and that telephone service is not necessary
for either voice or Internet access. I thought this technology was
still experimental. Can you enlighten me on this technology? Is it
affordable and reliable?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sounds like you're talking about fixed wireless service over
a cellular phone system. In some rural areas, phone companies will
set up cellular base sites to provide service to residents, rather
than wiring the area for regular phones. The way it works is you
have a send-receive device on the side of your house, which
communicates with the cellular base unit via radio waves.
</P>
<P>
   Such systems can provide Internet access at up to 28.8 kbps, for
about what you'd pay over a regular phone line. But before you buy
the land, get the name of the phone company from the land agent and
check out the service to make sure it's practical and affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm shopping for a new PC. I'm an average user _ word
processing, genealogy software, some work with databases and the
Internet _ but no games. How much RAM should I have at a minimum?
And what feature or features enhance the speed with which one moves
about on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most new home computers come with either 32 or 64 megabytes
of RAM memory. For your requirements, 32 megs should be sufficient,
but memory is so cheap now that you should look for a system with
64. That way, you'll have plenty of RAM for whatever memory-hungry
programs may come along in the next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   The speed at which you can surf the Web depends mostly on the
speed of your Internet connection. New PCs all come with 56 kbps
modems. The phone company is rapidly rolling out ADSL service,
which ups the speed to 356 kbps. And in some communities you can
get cable-modem service, which gives you more than 1 megabyte per
second.
</P>
<P>
   Internet performance _ especially with graphics-intensive Web
sites _ also can be enhanced by a faster chip in your PC and by
increased memory. In other words, the better the PC, the better the
Internet experience.

 A BREACH IN THE FIREWALL THE UNITED STATES TRIED TO BUILD AROUND
BRAZIL  (See also: BRAZIL-RDP, BRAZIL-IMPACT, BRAZIL-HISTORY(sw) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton and Treasury Secretary
Robert E. Rubin announced two months ago what they termed a
``precautionary'' $41.5 billion aid package for Brazil, they
described it as the first test of a new strategy to help countries
reform their economies before they are overwhelmed by the
tumultuous global market forces that have swept from Asia to Russia
to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the Brazilians committed to change their
free-spending ways and said their government was ``fully
committed'' to maintaining the value of its currency _ a commitment
that nations throughout Latin America said was vital if there was
any hope of keeping the rest of Latin America from descending into
a nasty recession.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after watching billions continue to pour out of the
country after their legislature balked at many of the toughest
reforms, the Brazilians have allowed their currency to fall. Many
suspect it is the first of a series of devaluations that could
resonate around the Americas, and perhaps around the world. And it
confronts Clinton, Rubin and the International Monetary Fund with a
painful choice: whether to continue pumping aid into a country that
seems reluctant to reform or to stand back, even if that means
risking a re-ignition of the economic turmoil that followed
Russia's economic crisis last summer.
</P>
<P>
   In carefully worded statements on Wednesday, neither Clinton nor
Rubin tipped his hand _ or promised much more help. ``It is
important that Brazil carry forward the implementation of a strong,
credible economic program,'' Rubin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In private, other administration officials predicted that
Brazil's problems would not trigger another selloff around the
world, the way panicked investors and lenders fled from developing
nations five months ago. The world economy is less brittle now,
they said, and investors are a lot better prepared and more savvy
than they were five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality, one senior administration official said on
Wednesday afternoon, is that ``none of us really know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a breach of the firewall that we spent months building
around Brazil,'' said another official, one of the president's top
economic advisers. ``It's hard to overestimate the anger around
here about how the Brazilians wasted time when they needed to deal
with their problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The firewall was a $41.5 billion ``precautionary'' aid program
for Brazil, including a $5 billion direct contribution from the
United States. The idea was to buy some time for Brazil, to enable
it to keep its economy together and its currency strong, while the
government implemented a detailed economic plan negotiated with the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also a firewall for the United States: Brazil is one
of America's largest trading partners, and a huge market for
American corporations. A deep recession there, it was feared, would
be felt in the United States far more sharply than the downturn in
Southeast Asia, where America's economic interests are more
limited.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton and Rubin, the firewall was also the first test of a
new strategy for coping with global economic instability. Their
idea was to aid countries before they got into deep trouble, the
kind of trouble that caused havoc for the economies of South Korea,
Indonesia, Thailand and Russia. ``It is far better to help a
country when it is still fundamentally healthy,'' Rubin said last
fall, ``and when it is easier to make economic reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   But the whole strategy hinged on the willingness of Brazil's
unpredictable legislature to enact a cutback program _ including
sharp and politically unpopular budget reductions that began to
strip away many of the government-provided benefits that Brazilians
had come to expect, but which their country could no longer afford.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature balked at many of the cuts. And ever since,
unconvinced that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso had the
political power to push through the rest of the package, investors
have continued to flee the country.
</P>
<P>
   The slow flight to the exits turned into a rush on Tuesday, when
$1.2 billion fled the country. The immediate cause was a challenge
to Cardoso from a tempestuous former president of Brazil, Itamar
Franco, now governor of the state of Minas Gerais. Franco said he
would refuse to pay the state's debts to the federal government,
claiming his coffers had been emptied by the economic downturn that
has swept the country. If he paid the cash, he said, there would be
little left for food, or salaries for state workers, or other
social programs. Investors concluded, rightly or wrongly, that
Cardoso was not firmly in control.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of unpredictable event that has recurred time
and again in the world financial crisis _ a clash between the
demands of global investors and the political imperatives of
countries that are tired of being told by the IMF how to run their
economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This calls into question the whole efficacy of the American
strategy,'' said Clyde Prestowitz, the president of the Economic
Strategy Institute and a former Commerce Department official. ``The
whole assumption of the administration's approach is that we are
going to aid countries that are committed to getting their act
together. But if it's a big or important country _ Russia because
of its nuclear power, Brazil because of its economic power _ there
is a temptation to simply hope that they will get their act
together. And the Brazilians didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are three big risks ahead now.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that Brazil will sink into an even deeper recession
than the one it has been facing for months. To defend the currency
at its newly devalued level, Brazil will probably have to keep
interest rates extremely high for the near future. But that, in
turn, could choke off economic activity _ at a time that factories
are closing and middle-class workers are finding their jobs
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real risk at this point that this could deteriorate
badly,'' said Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co. ``The question is whether they can contain the devaluation and
get the reform program moving. Because there really is no Plan B.''
</P>
<P>
   The second risk is that contagion will be reignited, at least in
the region, perhaps beyond. Because the Latin American economies
are so interlinked, many economists were warning on Wednesday that
Argentina and Chile could easily fall into recession. That prospect
_ and the social unrest it could engender _ was clearly on the mind
of President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina, during his visit this
week to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see the tension on their faces,'' said one
administration official who met with Menem and his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   And finally there is the challenge to American credibility.
After the failure of the rescue plan in Russia, Rubin and Clinton
have a lot riding on their bet in Brazil. In November, with the Dow
Jones industrial average still down and nervousness about global
economic trouble still fresh, Congress said not a word about
putting $5 billion in American funds at risk.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, Rep. Jim Saxton, R-N.J., who chairs the House
Joint Economic Committee, called the ``precautionary'' package a
``costly, counterproductive failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's view is, predictably, quite different. ``I start from
the view that the Brazilian program should work,'' he said Tuesday
afternoon, as rumors of the devaluation were beginning to swirl.
``It was a good program that was announced. Cardoso is deeply
committed to getting this done.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``The politics obviously are the key.''

 McColl Takes His Assurances to Los Angeles  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
After two tense days in San Francisco, BankAmerica Chief Executive
Officer Hugh McColl brought his California road show to the kinder,
gentler confines of Los Angeles yesterday, assuring business and
community leaders his takeover of the old BankAmerica is good for
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not bring my company to California with the idea of
taking anything away from California,'' the North Carolina banker
said in a speech before Town Hall Los Angeles, a public forum
similar to San Francisco's Commonwealth Club where McColl spoke
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McColl, whose NationsBank bought San Francisco's BofA three
months ago and took its name, was on the third day of a four-day
swing through California aimed at winning over critics of the
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco earlier this week, McColl was grilled by Mayor
Willie Brown and San Francisco supervisors over such matters as his
refusal to make the sort of itemized lending pledges that have been
customary for California's big financial institutions. In the end,
though, his vows to step up the flow of loans and donations in the
state earned praise from Brown and several San Francisco
supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in Los Angeles, McColl barely had to work up a
sweat. The passions aroused in San Francisco by the takeover of the
state's most important financial institution are largely absent in
Southern California, where the old BofA wasn't a hometown bank and
people have already seen their big local banks and thrifts _
including Home Savings, Great Western and First Interstate _
acquired by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just hasn't been much of a reaction,'' said Ezunial
Burts, president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In his Town Hall speech, McColl hit the same notes he has
sounded throughout his California tour, portraying the new BofA as
a progressive employer and responsible corporate citizen.
</P>
<P>
   He promised to increase services in black, Asian American and
Latino communities. He announced $2.5 million in gifts to fund
literacy programs in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, McColl announced a $5 million gift over five
years to help develop a Mission Bay campus for the University of
California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   McColl yesterday also highlighted bank programs aimed at
improving opportunities for women employees, including an expansion
of the bank's councils on diversity.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MCCOLL14 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  After his speech, McColl didn't have to field the tough questions
he faced at the Commonwealth Club about the resignations of senior
female executives of the old BofA or his treatment of former BofA
chief executive David Coulter.
</P>
<P>
   The only unexpected moment came when Town Hall president
Adrienne Medawar muffed her introduction, declaring she wanted to
``spank'' McColl. She quickly corrected herself, explaining she
wanted to ``thank'' him for appearing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some in the audience said they will reserve judgment
until they see how the new BofA performs. ``That was wonderful
talk,'' said Tony Espinoza, director of the United Latino Fund, a
local charity supported by BofA. `We'll have to see whether they
walk the walk.''

CRIPPEN, REPUBLICAN WHO WORKED FOR REAGAN, TO HEAD CONGRESSIONAL
BUDGET OFFICE  
(RK)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dan Crippen, who worked for President Reagan and
for Howard Baker Jr., the Senate majority leader in the early
1980's, was chosen Wednesday to be director of the Congressional
Budget Office, a powerful agency with an influential voice in
debates on economic and social policy.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Domenici, R-N.M., who is chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, announced the selection, after getting agreement from
the Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, and the
chairman of the House Budget Committee, John Kasich, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Crippen, 46, is more clearly identified with a political party
than any of his predecessors. But he is expected to continue the
agency's tradition as an independent, nonpartisan source of
information.
</P>
<P>
   The Budget Office estimates the cost of every significant bill
that goes to the floor of the House or the Senate; makes
projections of federal spending and tax revenues, and forecasts how
the economy will perform. The Congressional Budget Office can, in
effect, kill legislative proposals if it estimates that they will
significantly increase the deficit or reduce the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Crippen worked on economic and domestic policy on Capitol Hill
and at the White House. He went to the White House with Baker in
1987, when Baker became chief of staff for Reagan. Since leaving
the White House in February 1989, Crippen has been a Washington
lobbyist. His current clients include Ford Motor Co., General
Electric, Merrill Lynch and Baxter Healthcare Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Duberstein, former deputy chief of staff in the Reagan
White House, described Crippen as ``a pragmatic conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Crippen would be the fifth director of the Budget Office.
Democratic members of Congress say they see him as a mainstream
Republican, but worry that he does not have as much formal training
in economic theory as his predecessors. He received a bachelor's
degree from the University of South Dakota and a Ph.D. in public
administration and economics from Ohio State University in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The Budget Office director serves a four-year term and is
jointly appointed by the speaker of the House and the president pro
tem of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans chose the agency's current director, June O'Neill,
but House Republican leaders harshly criticized her last June. In a
letter, they said that the Budget Office had been ``consistently
wrong'' and had repeatedly understated economic growth and
overstated budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with Crippen this week, Lott made clear that he saw
plenty of room for improvements. Some conservative Republicans have
complained that the agency is dominated by what they see as the
old-fashioned liberal views of career civil servants in senior
positions.
</P>
<P>
   Professor William H. Oakland, who advised Crippen on his
doctoral dissertation, described him as ``a low-key but tenacious
guy'' and said he was ``one of my favorite students in 35 years of
teaching.'' In an interview, Oakland said: ``Dan's training in
economic theory is not as rigorous as that of some people with a
Ph.D. in economics, but he has more training in areas directly
germane to the operation of government, like budgeting, management
and the legislative process.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1989 to 1996, Crippen was senior vice president of the
Duberstein Group, a consulting firm. Since 1996, Crippen has been a
principal in Washington Counsel, a law and lobbying firm.

 Jordan's Life Off the Basketball Court  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Twenty years from now, people will recall how Michael Jordan
towered over the game of basketball. They also may still be buying
shoes, shirts and jackets graced with his logo _ a player flying
through the air, ball raised high in anticipation of a dunk shot.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of the man often called the greatest athlete of all
time is so strong that his retirement may not substantially
undermine his ability to pull in lucrative endorsement deals, which
earned him hundreds of millions of dollars during his stellar
13-year career with the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike most athletes whose marketability drops off
precipitously the day they retire, Jordan's such an icon and so
well known _ even to people who have never seen a basketball game _
that his ability to be an effective spokesperson won't be
diminished very much,'' said Jim Andrews, editor of the IEG
Endorsement Insider newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Nike, the company with which Jordan is most closely identified,
reportedly has him under contract through 2020. He's to be the
unofficial CEO of the Jordan Brand, a stand-alone Nike shoe and
apparel business that generates some $400 million in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   According to IEG, Jordan earned $45 million in endorsements last
year ($16 million of it from Nike). That sum handily handily
eclipsed the $34 million salary he earned for playing basketball.
He also far surpassed the endorsements of any other star. The
next-most sought-after U.S. athlete last year was golfer Tiger
Woods, who made some $28 million, primarily from Nike and American
Express.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan today has 13 endorsement contracts each worth at least $1
million. He sells Gatorade for Quaker Oats, long-distance for MCI
Worldcom, hot dogs for Ballpark Franks, batteries for Rayovac,
underwear for Hanes and cologne for Bijan.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just a small part of Jordan's impact on the economy.
Fortune magazine last June figured that through sales of books,
videos, movies, clothes and retail products, game tickets, TV
revenues and endorsements, Jordan by himself has generated some $10
billion since coming into the league. (His film ``Space Jam''
racked up $230 million in worldwide box office sales all by
itself.)
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's ability to drive the lane, make impossible shots and
control big games established his reputation as the best to ever
play basketball. His easy-going sincerity and infectious smile as a
TV pitchman turned him into one of the most famous people in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a super-human talent that everybody aspires to his
level of performance,'' said Bob Dorfman, who rates the
marketability of sports stars for Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding in San
Francisco. ``Everybody wants to be that good and have that much
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the catchiest phrases of the decade turned out to
be ``I want to be like Mike'' in the Gatorade commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan rewrote the rules for endorsements, demanding and
routinely getting multiyear deals. Many of his contracts still have
several years to go, so don't expect him to disappear from your
television any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   And if Jordan remains in the public spotlight, through coaching,
TV commentary or even playing golf, there's no reason why he can't
continue to fetch huge endorsement fees in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got such as strong image as a winner that as long as he's
out there and isn't receding into the leisurely life of retirement,
he can certainly continue to be a strong endorser,'' said Dorfman.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Knight, Nike's eccentric CEO, believes that there will be
no falloff in Jordan's drawing power. In fact, he's counting on it
because Jordan has been such an important cog in Nike's growth.
</P>
<P>
   Shoes and apparel bearing the Jordan logo have accounted for
more than $2.5 billion of the company's revenue. Entire basketball
teams wear Jordan brand products, among them the University of
California-Berkeley, the University of Cincinnati and St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan is the ultimate `Just do it' athlete,'' said
Knight in a statement, invoking the Nike slogan. ``I think that
when people say his career is over, I would limit it to his
basketball career. He's very bright, he's very competitive and when
he decides to take out some of his competitive instincts on the
business world, look out!''
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts say Jordan could eventually lose endorsements
for products such as Gatorade, which focused on his
basketball-playing abilities. On the other hand, he should be able
to continue indefinitely his work with companies such as MCI
Worldcom, which have traded on his personality and fame rather than
his athletic ability.
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems certain _ no player in any sport right now is
capable of replacing Jordan as the ultimate advertising ace. ``He's
one of a kind,'' said IEG's Andrews. ``I don't see anybody in the
next five years getting the kind of money he gets.''

 AMD Profitable Again, But Lower Than Expected  &HT;       
 By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Advanced Micro Devices reported its second straight profitable
quarter yesterday, but the results fell short of analysts'
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunnyvale chipmaker suffered from declining prices for its
chips and a manufacturing stumble, at the same time its archrival
Intel Corp. was firing on all cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a disappointing quarter,'' said John Lazlo, an analyst
with PaineWebber in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth quarter, ended December 27, AMD posted record
quarterly revenues of $788.8 million, but net income of $22.3
million (15 cents per share) missed analysts' estimates of 19 cents
per share, as reported in a First Call Corp. survey.
</P>
<P>
   In the year-ago quarter, AMD lost $12.3 million (9 cents) on
$613.2 million in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   AMD also reported record revenues for the year of $2.54 billion,
with a net loss of $104 million (72 cents per share). In the
previous year, AMD lost $21.1 million (15 cents) on $2.4 billion in
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   AMD's earnings report came the day after its arch-rival Intel
Corp. reported a smashingly successful quarter, including record
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Even though AMD made some inroads this past year, particularly
in selling chips for inexpensive computers, Intel has fought back
successfully. Intel maintains a vast lead over second place AMD in
the sale of microprocessors, the brains of personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   AMD's gains, as well as new products rolling out now and over
the next few months, had Jerry Sanders _ the company's founder,
chairman and chief executive _ as optimistic as always.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be able to increase ... revenues and average selling
price while maintaining the last quarter's record volume levels,''
Sanders told analysts in a conference call. ``We are increasingly
confident of our ability to broaden our market and our customer
base.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts thought AMD would have done better, given signs of a
possible rebound in the semiconductor industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In December, we heard anecdotal news about better PC sales,
and automatically assumed AMD would benefit as would Intel,'' said
PaineWebber's Lazlo. ``AMD had production glitches so it couldn't
manufacture as many 400 MHz chips as it expected, and its average
selling prices eroded 13 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company lost about $5 million in its
nonmicroprocessor products, although it had expected those items to
turn the corner into profitability.
</P>
<P>
   AMD made its announcement after the close of trading. Although
its stock rose 13 cents to $31.63 yesterday, it fell to $27.63 in
after hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that, in the months ahead, it plans to release
new chips to compete with Intel in every segment, including laptop
computers, high performance desktops and corporate servers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always an uphill battle,'' said Robert McCormack Jr., a
general partner with Integral Capital Partners in Menlo Park.
``You've got to stay up with Intel. Intel is doing a great job of
bracketing them on the low end.''
</P>
<P>
   AMD's K6-2 chips were squeezed by Intel's Pentium II on the high
end and Intel's Celeron chips on the low end. Intel showed strong
sales of both chips in its fourth quarter report Tuesday.

 Apple Reports 5th Straight Profitable Quarter  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Apple Computer, cashing in on insatiable demand for its new
space-age iMac computer, yesterday posted its fifth straight
quarterly profit.
</P>
<P>
   The Cupertino company said first-quarter profits more than
tripled, to $152 million (95 cents per share) from $47 million (33
cents) in the same quarter a year ago. The earnings exceeded
analysts' predictions of 69 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Discounting a $29 million gain from Apple's sale of 2.9 million
shares of ARM Holdings Plc, the company earned $123 million (78
cents).
</P>
<P>
   Equally significant, Apple reported its first year-to-year gain
in sales since late 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unit growth year-over-year was three to four times higher than
the industry average,'' Apple interim chief executive Steve Jobs
said in a statement. ``Apple ended the quarter with only two days
of inventory, besting industry-leading Dell's seven days of
inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnings were at their highest level since the company returned
to profitability. For the fourth quarter of 1998, previously
Apple's highest earning quarter under Jobs' renewed leadership, the
company netted $106 million.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by 519,000 unit shipments of the curvy, translucent iMac
to consumers and first-time PC buyers, Apple registered $1.71
billion in sales, up 8 percent from $1.58 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers expect the trend to continue this year with
the release of new, speedy, top-of-the-line models called the Power
Mac G3 desktop computers. A laptop version of the iMac is expected
this spring, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The iMac is really helping them out, and I'm sure the
turnaround will continue with the new models,'' said Tom
Rhinelander, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
``It's a very good showing for a company that looked down and on
the ropes a year ago. Amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Apple had returned to the black largely because
of severe cost cutting and the elimination of unprofitable
divisions and products. But the company had not created compelling
new products for consumers and businesses, and its sales were below
par.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's strong quarterly results for the three-month period
ended Dec. 25, 1998, reflect the runaway success of the iMacs _ the
hot-selling model that now comes in grape, blueberry, strawberry,
tangerine and lime. An estimated 800,000 units have been sold since
the iMac hit computer store shelves in August.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the sales figures indicate an increase in market
share for Apple, a key factor for software companies who are
considering writing programs for the Macintosh system.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's share of the worldwide PC market has improved to 5
percent from 3 percent a year ago, according to ZD Market
Intelligence of La Jolla.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the company's fiscal recovery has fueled a stock
price rebound. Yesterday it climbed 38 cents, to a 52-week high of
$46.50.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the good tidings, however, some remain skeptical that Apple
can sustain an upturn into the long-term future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple's at a peak right now,'' said CIBC Oppenheimer's James
Poyner Jr. ``They are likely to see a plateauing of iMac shipments
going forward and that is going to make the stock a lot less
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also caution that the $1,199 iMac could be vulnerable
to lower-priced personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their problems are not over,'' Rhinelander cautioned. ``But
they are much stronger than they've been in years.''

 Escrow services in demand as Net auction sites proliferate  &HT;       
 By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Internet auctions can be a great way to buy or sell goods. Or they
be a tricky game of chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Say you're selling your prized Beanie Baby collection. You find
a buyer who will pay your price. Now for the hard part: Who makes
the first move? The buyer wants you to send the Beanie Babies
before she'll pay. But you want your money first.
</P>
<P>
   Online escrow services hope to end that game of chicken. Just as
real-estate escrow services help protect property buyers and
sellers, online escrow aims to be a buffer between buyer and
seller. Both systems work much the same way. In exchange for a
percentage of the transaction _ generally about 5 percent for the
online services _ the escrow company acts as impartial third party
that holds funds until the transaction is complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Internet, there's no way to tell who you're dealing
with,'' said Bob Hanlon of Pleasanton, who buys and sells older PC
equipment online via auctions and classified ads. After getting
stiffed a few times, he started insisting on using escrow services.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm the seller, I typically tell buyers to use an escrow
service unless they want to prepay,'' Hanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 5 million transactions take place monthly via online
auctions, classified ads or newsgroups, according to analysts'
estimates. The majority are transactions between individuals _
usually strangers. Completing a sale requires a considerable amount
of trust, and lots of things can go wrong: Goods may not live up to
their description. They may be lost or broken in transit.
</P>
<P>
   It's a situation ripe for misunderstandings, mistakes and even
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know each other and don't necessarily want to
trust the other party,'' said Sherman Kwok, founder of i-Escrow,
one of three major online escrow services. ``Because we're an
impartial third party and hold the funds, both the buyer and seller
feel they won't get ripped off.``
</P>
<P>
   Kwok started i-Escrow in early 1997 after he tried to sell his
old NeXT computer online. Finding a buyer wasn't the problem.
Agreeing on a price went smoothly enough. But closing the deal was
another thing altogether.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of ESCROW14 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``The buyer said, `Why don't you send &LR;   &LR; the machine, and I'll
send you the money?' I said, `I don't know you. Why don't you send
me the money, and then I'll send you the computer?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Kwok and his buyer couldn't agree. He wound up keeping the
computer and using it to start his business. The San Mateo company
now counts more than 20,000 customers, and its services are offered
on eBay, Yahoo auctions and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   I-Escrow is the newest entry to what is still a tiny market. One
of the first companies in the business was TradeSafe, founded by
Bruce Todesco, a former special assistant attorney general in Rhode
Island and amateur musician. Todesco started up TradeSafe of
Providence, R.I., in 1995 after he tried to buy four-track tape
recorders online. He made offers on two and got e-mails from the
sellers accepting his orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was when the whole problem of `I'll send you the goods
after I receive the check' and `I'll send you the the check after I
receive the goods''' occurred, he said. He looked for an escrow
service and didn't find one, so he started his own.
</P>
<P>
   Trade-direct of Tampa, Fla., was founded about the same time
Todesco was trying to get TradeSafe off the ground. Also offering
escrow services: Online auctioneer Auction Universe
( &LR; www.auctionuniverse.com &LR; ), which provides escrow for a $19.95
yearly subscription fee.
</P>
<P>
   All of the escrow companies are privately held, and none would
release sales information. But analysts expect the market to grow
considerably as the online auction market booms.
</P>
<P>
   ``As people put up more and more goods (on auction sites), this
is an important service to be able to offer. People are putting
cars up for auction now, so an escrow service comes in handy,''
said Fiona Swerdlow, a digital-commerce analyst at Jupiter
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The escrow services generally work this way: The buyer and
seller agree to a deal. Either buyer or the seller can hire the
escrow service via e-mail. Terms of the deal are transmitted to
both parties to make sure they agree. Then the buyer pays the
escrow service using any legal payment means besides cash. (One
advantage escrow services provide is that they allow credit card
transactions, which most individual sellers cannot offer.)
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of ESCROW14 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The escrow service notifies the seller that payment has been
received. The seller sends the item, using a method that is
trackable, such as UPS, Federal Express or registered mail. After
the buyer receives the item and determines that it is satisfactory,
she notifies the escrow service to release payment to the seller.
The escrow service cuts a check for the seller after deducting a
service fee.
</P>
<P>
   If the item isn't what the buyer ordered _ a Beanie Baby arrives
without the tag that makes it more valuable, for instance _ the
buyer notifies the escrow service. Then the buyer packs it up and
returns it, using a trackable method. When the seller receives it,
he notifies the escrow service and it refunds the buyer's money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like buying insurance for your house or car,'' said
Mark Dodd, founder of AuctionWatch, an auction monitoring site.
Only it may be even more crucial on the Internet, Dodd said,
because people can easily forge or change identities.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Monroe of Seattle sells reconditioned PCs over the
Internet. These days, he rarely does business with buyers who won't
use an escrow service. He learned the hard way, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I sold a Mac to a guy in Colorado,'' he said. ``He wanted
it COD (cash on delivery). I don't do COD, and I suggested using an
escrow service. Instead, we spent a week e-mailing. I was afraid
I'd lose the sale, so I sent it. The idiot writes a bad check.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Monroe, it was only a $60 loss.

AFTER RUSSIA LESSON, BOND PRICES KEEP STABLE IN BRAZIL CRISIS
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: BRAZIL-RDP, BRAZIL-IMPACT, BRAZIL-MARKETPLACE,

MARKET, EDIT-BRAZIL)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This time investors were better prepared to absorb the shock.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the aftermath of Russia's collapse in August, the
initial flight to safety that followed the Brazilian currency
devaluation Wednesday did not turn to panic in U.S. stock and bond
markets. Big bettors learned their lesson: Fool me once, shame on
you. Fool me twice, shame on me.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices soared as soon as Brazil announced its devaluation;
investors rushed to the immediate safety of the Treasury market.
But bonds gave up much of their gain by the day's end, with the
price of the 30-year Treasury bond rising 1 6/32 to 101 28/32 and
the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, moving down to
5.13 percent, from 5.20 percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the corporate bond market, which literally froze up after the
Russian collapse, big-name bonds rallied to trim their early losses
by the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   There was even time for joking on trading floors once the U.S.
stock market began to recover. ``How does Brazil solve its
problems?'' ran the big question of the day. The answer: ``Change
its name to Brazil.com, and it can take off like the Internet
stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   When Russia suddenly devalued its currency and effectively
defaulted on its debt in mid-August, investors around the world
were stunned. Many refused to believe the United States and the
International Monetary Fund would allow Russia to collapse until it
actually happened.
</P>
<P>
   But with that experience still fresh in the memories of market
participants, Brazil's policy reversal _ which stopped far short of
full-scale devaluation and default _ did not come as much of a
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major lesson learned last summer was that there could be
default on sovereign debt,'' said Denis Adler, the corporate bond
strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. ``People had forgotten that and
discounted it as a risk then.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors have become much more risk averse, moving
away from markets that they think are vulnerable. They are no
longer borrowing so much, either, to make big bets _ known on Wall
street as leveraging. That means they are not as vulnerable to
outsized losses and panic selling to cover their loans. This kind
of leverage was also at the heart of the near collapse of Long-Term
Capital Management, the hedge fund whose losses spooked investors
in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timing is very important,'' said Lawrence Brainard, the global
head of emerging market research at Chase Securities. ``The markets
have had time to reduce leverage and exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Claire, the head of the taxable fixed income trading desk at
First Capital Group in Charlotte, N.C., said: ``Everyone is saying
it is not the end of the world. We have been down this road
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's collapse sent investors fleeing to the U.S. Treasury
market, pushing the yield on the 30-year bond down to 4.72 percent
in early October. The fear of any risk effectively froze trading in
the corporate and high-yield junk bond markets and even hindered
the trading of older Treasury securities.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Federal Reserve, fearing that the smooth
functioning of the world's financial system was threatened, cut its
interest-rate target three times.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian debacle also forced many money managers to sell
profitable holdings they would normally have kept just because they
had to offset huge losses in emerging markets like Russia, where
selling was difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that could contain the contagion this time is
that there are very different players at the center of the trading
action.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, many of the losing bets were made by hedge funds that
had put far too many of their investment eggs in one basket,
forcing them to sell quickly. In Brazil, the big U.S. and foreign
banks are the main players in the currency market. They are bigger,
more diversified and there is less pressure to sell, according to
one executive at a major bank. And these institutions, after
Russia, have trimmed their investments in Brazil and Latin America
to lessen their risk.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the situation is still delicate and the news from
Brazil is far from positive for many investors. Uncertainty over
what will happen next in Brazil is bound to hang over world
financial markets for some time.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of emerging market debt rose sharply Wednesday,
although it, too, rallied a little by the end of the day. The J.P.
Morgan emerging market bond index, which shows the difference in
the yield countries must pay to sell emerging market bonds and the
yield on comparable U.S. Treasury securities, jumped to 14.26
percentage points Wednesday. It is still below its peak of 17.05
percentage points in September but above its recent low of 9.44
percent in November.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the problems in Brazil and other emerging markets ``are
still with us,'' said Desmond Lachman, the director of emerging
markets economic research at Salomon Smith Barney. He argued that
Brazil still had the potential to roil world markets.
</P>
<P>
   And Arturo Porzecanski, chief economist for the Americas at ING
Barings, was worried that other shoes might still drop. The
devaluation, he suggested, may be ``too little and may be too
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other parts of the program are not in place yet,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For all the nagging fears of the future, though, the reaction of
American financial markets Wednesday shows that the system is not
as vulnerable to bad news as it was in August.

 &HT;    New-look Tyson still full of old rage
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The image-makers have been hard at work.
</P>
<P>
   They give us photo ops of Mike Tyson distributing toys and
turkeys, hoping to steer attention away from the pending sentencing
hearing for assaulting two motorists in Maryland. They create slick
TV ads showing a dedicated Tyson doing his pushups, running at
sunrise and eating his cereal, as if he were an aspiring Olympian
from Mayberry, not the troubled celebrity from the Bronx who this
week spewed profanity on live satellite TV interviews meant to pump
pay-per-view sales.
</P>
<P>
   The new promoter, the new manager and trainer and security guard
and camp members _ they all paint pictures of a hard-working,
humble Mike Tyson. Then they see the spin obliterated in an
obscenity-laced session with a small group of media
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I lost to (Evander) Holyfield,'' Tyson said. ``I bit his
... ear. He's a good fighter, but he's not Mike Tyson. He and
Lennox Lewis are outstanding fighters, but they're not Mike Tyson.
They can't sell out Madison Square Garden. I can sell out Madison
Square Garden (doing anything). I'm the champion even when I'm not
champion. When they're the champion, I'm the ... king. They talk
about me like I'm a God. Muhammad Ali set the stage. But there's
never been a fighter as big as Mike Tyson. Look at the gate
receipts.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who count receipts apparently are keeping the numbers
secret from Tyson. Only 6,000 tickets had been sold as of early
Wednesday for his first fight in 19 months, Saturday against
Francois Botha at the MGM Grand, and signals from pay-per-view
operators are mixed. Conversely, Holyfield-Lewis, two months away,
is nearly sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson has an undisputed place in boxing's financial record book.
He has been a part of seven of the top 10 all-time grossing fights.
A large segment of the population remains fascinated by a man who
won the heavyweight title when he was 20, then saw his personal
life deteriorate _ and take his ring wits with it, culminating with
two bites of Holyfield's ears in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remains that when Tyson enters the ring against
Botha, he will represent someone who lost his last two fights, both
to Holyfield, hasn't competed in 19 months, because of license
revocation), hasn't won in 28 months, since a TKO over Bruce
Seldon, and is nearly 11 years removed from his perceived peak, the
91-second destruction of Michael Spinks. Further, he has done
little recently to prove he has rehabilitated himself out of the
ring. The public cursing sessions have become prevalent enough that
his advisers finally told him Wednesday to cool it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put a muzzle on me,'' Tyson said at Wedneday's final news
conference. ``I can't really say what I want to say today because
of what I said on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   But he already had said plenty:
</P>
<P>
   _ On himself: ``My credibility is shot. If the sleaziest tramp
in the history of the world says, 'Mike Tyson grabbed my (rear),'
people would believe her because Mike Tyson is (expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   _ On God: ``If there's a God, how could there be slavery? But
you want to believe in God because you don't want to be a savage.
But if there's a God, there's a heaven. If there's a heaven, you'll
be judged, and some people will burn in hell. We're all creatures
of contradiction. I was really screwed up before. That was just a
few days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On his upbringing: ``I was the scourge of Brooklyn. I was the
scourge of every part of society. I've been at the bottom, I came
up, fell again, and I'm coming back. Mike is gonna be Mike. You can
keep your tennis shoe deals, your little toy deals. I'll curse.
I'll be crass and obnoxious.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On his comeback: ``I'm not supposed to be here. I was supposed
to be finished after (ex-wife) Robin Givens, after jail (for rape),
after being thorazined-out wait a minute, what's that stuff they
gave me? lithium. Most of the guys I fought are in oblivion now.
They're fighting to pay their crack dealer.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On psychiatrists who examined him before he was re-licensed by
Nevada: ``There's no way those docs were sane. They love to torture
some people's minds. They would've been great Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On what he expects Botha to do when Tyson goes at him:
``Die.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't all negative. Tyson gushed about an I.R.A. account,
now worth $200,000, he only recently discovered former mentor Cus
D'Amato started for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was living crazy, I spent $200,000 on belts and
underwear or champagne for girls in nightclubs,'' he said. ``I said
to my wife, 'You think Don (King) or Rory (Holloway) set this up
for me? No (expletive) way.' Cus must've known I would screw up my
money. I never thought anybody would love my black (rear).''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, who owes the IRS $12 million in back taxes, said he wants
to fight four more times in 1999 and then might retire. He has
other 10-rounders penciled in for April and July. Showtime then
will try to make a third Holyfield-Tyson fight, although
Holyfield's possible retirement and probable financial demands make
that bout improbable.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's enthusiasm for competing also has been questioned.
Trainer Tommy Brooks insists that the former champion has been
focused in camp, that he ``hasn't missed a day in the gym.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brooks also said, ``I look at it like this: Where else can a
kid from the ghetto with no education make this money? Maybe he
doesn't want to fight any more. But can you picture him flipping
burgers or slinging trash cans? Once you're used to living a
certain lifestyle, you want to stay with it.''
</P>
<P>
   On firing King and co-managers Holloway and John Horne and
moving his camp from Las Vegas to Phoenix, Tyson said, ``I needed a
fresh start. This is a new version of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The rewrites sound familiar.

EDITORIAL: BAD NEWS IN BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: BRAZIL-RDP, BRAZIL-IMPACT, BRAZIL-HISTORY BRAZIL-BONDS,
BRAZIL-U.S., BRAZIL-LATIN, BRAZIL-MARKETPLACE, MARKET) 
(DW) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Jan. 14:
</P>
<P>
   It has been only two months since the International Monetary
Fund put together a $41.5 billion rescue package for Brazil that
was predicated on Brazil's enacting fiscal reforms. But in that
short time, Brazil's situation has been deteriorating. That led to
its 8 percent currency devaluation Wednesday, a move that unsettled
world markets.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that devaluation looks like an unsatisfactory
half-step. It may alarm Brazilians worried about inflation, but it
is not enough to bring the currency down to a reasonable value. The
move may intensify Brazil's recession rather than help to end it.
Weakness in Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America,
inevitably will damage other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has a history of hyperinflation, which it ended in large
part through a policy that tied the value of the currency, the
real, to the dollar by allowing only gradual and controlled
deflation. But the allowed decline was not enough to reflect
economic realities, a fact that became of great importance when
international financial markets turned queasy last year in the wake
of Asia's currency troubles and the Russian default on its debts.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF plan provided money to allow Brazil to let its currency
decline gradually while it took needed steps to cut wasteful
government spending, which largely goes to support current and
retired public employees. But Brazil's Congress has balked at some
of the modest reforms promised by President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, and one important state is threatening to default on its
debts to the federal government rather than cut spending.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil still has ample resources to defend its currency, as it
had to do Wednesday even after the devaluation. But it must show it
can deal with its fiscal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the IMF may have to conclude that its decision to put
together a Brazilian package was a mistake, and that to continue it
would be to throw good money after bad.

   LUCENT DEAL FOR ASCEND COMES WITH LITTLE FANFARE
</P>
<P>
   In announcing its $20 billion acquisition of Ascend
Communications, Lucent Technologies called it the ``largest
technology merger ever'' and ``a leap rather than a step,'' but
there was an unmistakable whiff of ho-hum in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The high-technology marriage is a stock swap of 0.825 share of
Lucent for each share of Ascend, a 19 percent premium over Ascend's
market value when trading ended on Tuesday. The deal would have
been dramatic had it occurred a year ago, but by the time it was
done it seemed inevitable and perhaps even overdue to many analysts
and customers.
</P>
<P>
   2D YEAR FOR WALL STREET PROJECT
</P>
<P>
   Senior executives from several dozen blue-chip corporations will
gather in New York on Thursday with hundreds of their counterparts
at minority-owned companies for the second annual economic
conference organized by the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson's advocacy
initiative, the Wall Street Project. Mr. Jackson will use the
occasion to exhort corporate America to expand its ``trade
relationships'' with the ``emerging markets'' in inner cities and
rural backwaters, but he will also be trying to demonstrate that
the Wall Street Project is operating with a broader mandate and a
clearer focus than it demonstrated at its debut conference last
year.
</P>
<P>
   BIAS AGAINST MINORITY STATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Radio stations aimed primarily at black and Hispanic audiences
receive significantly less ad revenue per listener and have also
been forced to offer deeper discounts than their mainstream
counterparts, an F.C.C. study has determined.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT WITNESS CROSS-EXAMINED
</P>
<P>
   The government's lead trial lawyer in its case against
Microsoft, David Boies, rested his case. Cross-examining the
company's first witness, the MIT economist Richard Schmalensee, he
was unable to get him to agree that Microsoft holds a monopoly in
personal-computer operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   PROFITS FALL AT BIG RETAILERS
</P>
<P>
   Profits after taxes at large United States retailers averaged
1.9 cents for every dollar of sales during the third quarter, down
from the 2.3 cents in the second quarter and 2 cents in the third
quarter of 1997, the Commerce Department said. It was the lowest
level in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   BELL ATLANTIC IN INTERNET DEAL
</P>
<P>
   In a move to compete with high-speed cable-modem services,
America Online and Bell Atlantic announced a joint effort to sell
high-speed Internet access to America Online's customers. The
alliance marks a significant step in America Online's effort to
retain its leadership as an entry point to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   HONG KONG REACTS TO CHINA CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   Fears of a debt crisis in China swept through Hong Kong,
punishing the stock market and stirring fresh anxiety in a city
that seemed to be recovering from Asia's distress.
</P>
<P>
   ADVANCED MICRO POSTS EARNINGS
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro Devices reported fourth-quarter earnings of $22.3
million, or 15 cents a diluted share, a few cents short of
analysts' estimates. It was the company's second consecutive
profitable quarter after it reported losses in the first half of
1998. It posted results after the close of the market. Earlier its
shares fell $3.75, to $27.75.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer reported earnings that exceeded estimates by more
than 10 percent for its fifth consecutive profitable quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola said its profit in the fourth quarter fell 60 percent,
less than expected.

ON THE EVE OF THE TRIAL, AN UNEASY QUIETUDE SLIPS OVER THE CAPITOL
</HEADLINE>
   (See also IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-LEGAL, IMPEACH-CLINTON,
IMPEACH-HOUSE.) 
(nk) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The debating chamber doors were masked Wednesday to
prevent early peeking at the bar of the Senate where tables for
contending lawyers had been set up along with other trappings for
the opening arguments in the trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate has invited us over to look at their digs and tell
us where the men's room is,'' Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr.,
R-Wis., declared genially, rounding a corridor as one of the House
prosecutors who visited for a private tour of the courtroom setting
where they will try to banish Clinton from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the trial, the Capitol was suffused in uneasy
quietude. Officials were vetting history books in the Senate
library for some final ceremonial details, reading from President
Andrew Johnson's 1868 impeachment trial, an ordeal that prompted
one agonized participant, Sen. Edmund G. Ross of Kansas, to write
this wish for the nation: ``It is to be hoped that its like may
never return.''
</P>
<P>
   But its like has returned, and many of the figures involved are
turning for comfort to history in search of assurances that the
right thing can be done.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., has been carrying about
his dog-eared copy of The Federalist Papers, savoring just how
forward-looking Alexander Hamilton could be as a founding father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most extraordinary things are being written about what
this new office of president will be,'' the senator read aloud in a
corridor citation of Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans insist that the Clinton trial is not about
sex, Moynihan has magic-marked and gladly reads aloud Hamilton's
near satirical, now prescient reference to warnings that Americans
studying their presidents might some day have ``to blush at the
unveiled mysteries of a future seraglio.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald A. Ritchie, the Senate's associate historian, finds
comfort in the pungent narrative of a Washington newspaper
correspondent, Francis A. Richardson, who covered the Johnson
impeachment and found it ``more intense and thrilling'' even than
the Civil War with its many ``lulls'' at the battleground.
</P>
<P>
   ``No story as to what the Executive or Legislature might or
would do was too wild to receive credence,'' Richardson wrote in a
1902 memoir.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington has become so fruitful in gossip and scandal, and
intrigue, political and otherwise, that in contrast the ordinary
debates can but prove exceeding dry reading,'' he recalled for The
Historical Society of Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Television crews, jumpily waiting in the Capitol for the
Thursday excitement, suddenly dashed outside at midday to film a
man in a pink bunny suit. He was one of a group of protesters who
set fire to bales of hay at the base of the West Staircase as
members of the group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
Cell phones crackled with news producers' reports of a nonhistoric
incident, and the crews retreated inside for news of higher crimes
and misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Senate, there were mere scraps of scattershot
interviews to be heard. ``He's going to be missed,'' Sen. Olympia
J. Snowe, R-Maine, said sadly, speaking not of the president but of
Michael Jordan and his retirement from basketball.
</P>
<P>
   In his history of the Johnson trial, Ross, looking back a
generation later, described ``the tumult and demoralization of the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The streets of Washington and the corridors of the Capitol
were thronged from day to day,'' Ross said of gaslight-era crowd
scenes that television has considerably thinned.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are modern electronic weapons detectors at the Capitol
entrances; in 1868, vigilant guards demanded a reporter unwrap his
pad and writing materials to convince them ``it did not contain an
infernal machine.'' Back then, reporters gambled thousands of
dollars on the trial outcome, Richardson recalled; nowadays, daily
polling dulls any gambler's instinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful how, up to the last moment, the friends of
the Executive and the adherents of Congress were both confident as
to the result,'' Richardson wrote. It was as if he anticipated the
modern ``spin teams'' of vying political factions that, historic
dignity or not, are expected to be in garrulous reach somewhere
about the Capitol within minutes of the opening arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news nowadays won't keep a minute,'' Richardson said in
turn-of-the-century despair at the tyranny of the telegraph. On the
eve of the arguments over Clinton, the search for something new was
all about the details: Are the trial counsels' tables really
kidney-shaped, as some sources said? Or, from the readings of
history might they better yet be spleen-shaped?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a moment when rumor and rancor were not in the air,''
recalled Richardson the last time. ``Not a moment when hearts did
not tremble for the Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross found the Johnson trial ``sublimely and intensely
dramatic.'' He aptly laid out the impeachment stakes for Clinton
now, as much as for Johnson then: Either to be acquitted or ``to go
the balance of his life's journey with the brand of infamy on his
back.''

LANDMARK ENTERTAINMENT BRINGING CIRCUS TO CALIFORNIA TRIBAL CASINO

<P>
   NORTH HOLLYWOOD, Calif. -- Theme park specialist Landmark
Entertainment Group announced Wednesday that it plans to bring the
glamour and glitz of Las Vegas to a massive casino expansion
project in the mountains east of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Landmark, which designed the Star Trek: The Experience
attraction at the Las Vegas Hilton, was named lead designer for a
$120 million expansion of the Barona Indian Reservation casino on a
mountain plateau near Lakeside, about 40 miles east of downtown San
Diego. It plans to more than triple the size of the casino to
450,000 square feet, using what is described as a whimsical
turn-of-the-century circus theme that will turn the property into a
one-of-a-kind destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are designing will be the highest quality, as if it
were being done for a Disney theme park,'' said Gary Goddard, chief
executive officer. The project will add to the casino site a pair
of big-top tents, including a three-ring circus; a two-story
carousel; Victorian dirigibles; animatronic high-wire acts and a
performance stage.
</P>
<P>
   Goddard, who worked for Walt Disney's Imagineering theme park
division before founding Landmark in 1980, said his company will
devote about 20 employees to the project, which is scheduled to
open in December 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Barona casino is already one of the state's largest and most
profitable American Indian casinos, spokesman Joseph Gerbino said.
The expansion also will add a 250-room hotel and a 200-acre golf
course. Other additions include bingo and off-track wagering areas,
a VIP lounge, a child care center, and a 100-seat steak house along
with an expanded buffet restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The casino plans to add 600 employees after the improvements,
the construction of which is expected to begin this summer.
</P>
<P>
   North Hollywood-based Landmark, which is half-owned by noted
investor Prince Alaweed Bin Talal Abdulaziz Al Saud, is a veteran
of casino construction, including most of the design work for
Caesars Palace and the Desert Kingdom hotels in Las Vegas. It is
also working on a World of Oz theme park in Kansas City and three
projects in China.

 &HT;    Atlanta Hawks feelings mixed on Jordan's exit
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There was no fun in the locker room Wednesday, no
wisecracks, none of the jock humor that Hawks president Stan Kasten
once noted can be the cruelest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped in towels, with knees and backs getting iced, players
who often had been beaten with impunity by Michael Jordan stared at
his image on a 46-inch TV screen, listening to his goodbye to
basketball on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   When Vancouver forward Shareef Abdur-Rahim's young voice broke
the silence, it was to ask, half-seriously, ``Do you think he's
gonna play hockey and then come back again?''
</P>
<P>
   A voice said no. ``No more comebacks.'' That was Steve Smith of
the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   For all that Jordan meant to the game over 13 seasons, this was
all about respect. NBA veterans and rookies eager to start the
season played pick-up games right up to noon in Georgia Tech's
arena, then raced for the big locker room the Hawks will use for
their split home schedule again this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll miss him,'' Mookie Blaylock of the Hawks said. ``But I
won't miss guarding him or him guarding me.''
</P>
<P>
   That was always a mismatch, but Blaylock never turned away from
the assignment. You had to play Jordan with the hand the game
dealt. If that was unfair, well, so were Jordan's talent and
consuming drive to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played against him four times,'' said Abdur-Rahim, who is
from Marietta. ``The last game, they blew us out. I scored 16 in
about half the game. It was a bad loss.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was a chance to learn from a master, he said. ``I learned
a lot by watching him. I don't mean so much in how to do things on
the court but how he was. He taught me that you don't really reach
the peak of your powers until you are 30 or 31, because so much of
this game is mental. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``As he went on, he got smarter, his knowledge of the game
expanded, his ability to deal mentally with his opponent got
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   For a young, talented man of 22, two NBA seasons under his belt
and on ``loan'' to a Canadian team one more season before free
agency, this is heady stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Abdur-Rahim, who left the University of California after
compiling a 3.5 GPA his freshman year, said that, thanks to Jordan,
he expects to have his best seasons at 30 and beyond. ``He makes
you think that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is, he was the best I ever saw,'' free agent Ivano
Newbill said. ``You admired him and respected him. But now that
he's gone, it opens the doors to the championship for everybody
else. We'll miss him, but it's nice to have the opportunity for
everybody else.''

 &HT;    Jordan's last shot: Retirement
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Hours before making official his retirement from the
game he mastered, Michael Jordan executed a move he said will
typify his life away from the NBA: He took his kids to school.
</P>
<P>
   That done, Jordan headed Wednesday to the United Center _ the
edifice his otherworldly play financed and filled to capacity every
time he played _ to break the news that the league would have to go
on without him. He had another life to live, and it's time to get
to it.
</P>
<P>
   A city, and much of a nation, mourned. David Falk, his agent and
adviser, was one who wept.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said, ``I told my wife (Juanita) on the way over here
that I felt like was getting married.''
</P>
<P>
   He actually was divorcing himself from the game that brought him
millions of dollars and millions of fans, the game he elevated to
unprecedented heights, the game that cannot afford to lose him. He
conquered all of the challenges basketball presented and ultimately
set unreachable standards.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, it came down to this: Michael Jordan realized he
could not top Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, I'm at peace,'' said Jordan, who ``retired'' in
October 1993 to pursue a baseball career only to rejoin the Bulls
after 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his first retirement, when he would not ``shut the door''
on a comeback, Jordan said he was 99.9 percent certain that he had
played his final game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've accomplished everything I could accomplish
individually,'' said Jordan, who turns 36 next month. ``This is the
perfect time to walk away from the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan scripted an ending that the most mushy of novelists
wouldn't dare write: He won the 1997-98 NBA Championship for the
Bulls in June when, in Game 6 in Utah, he stripped Karl Malone of
the ball and hit the title-clinching jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   That shot wrapped up a 45-point effort that rates as the last
page of a
</P>
<P>
   lavish portolio: six championships, five NBA most valuable
player awards, six NBA Finals MVPs, three all-star game MVPs, one
defensive player of the year award, 10 scoring titles . . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael always represent a standard of excellence,'' Bulls
owner Jerry Reinsdorf said. ``This is a day I hoped would never
come. It's a tough day for the Bulls, the NBA, the city of Chicago,
millions of fans around the world. It's hard to imagine the game
played without him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was becoming hard for Jordan, too. He said he was physically
capable of playing a 14th season _ except for a severed tendon in
his right index finger, suffered while trying to cut a cigar in the
Bahamas last week. But mentally, he said, he was depleted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is difficult because I'm giving up something I truly,
truly love. . . . I'm sad leaving, but I'm happy that life goes on
to another stage.''
</P>
<P>
   That stage, he said, will include fulfilling endorsement
obligations, getting more active in his vast business dealings and,
most importantly, being a more hands-on parent. Juanita Jordan
said, ``My life won't change at all. But I see Michael doing more
car-pooling.''
</P>
<P>
   That's challenge enough, according to Jordan. ``People have said
I won't have any challenges away from the game. Being a parent is
very challenging,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm basically just going to take it easy. . . . I'll live
vicariously through my kids, if they play the game of basketball. .
. . In the next step, there are a lot of different components. I
enjoy taking my kids to school and picking them up. Things that
seem so simple, I never got the opportunity to enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   And for that reason, NBA commissioner David Stern said he
embraced Jordan's resignation. Jordan's reign had to end sometime.
``I get to say thank you for 29 teams and hundreds of millions of
fans,'' Stern said at the United Center. ``It's a great day because
the greatest player, ever, gets the opportunity to retire with the
grace that described your play.''
</P>
<P>
   To many people Wednesday, the scene was reminiscent of Jordan's
first ``retirement'' more than five years ago. That was at the
Berto Center in nearby Dearfield, Ill. This one took place at the
United Center, at midcourt of the playing floor. There was a
surreal feel to it, as Jordan sat at the makeshift stage,
resplendent in a dark suit, white shirt and elegant tie. He was
flanked by wife Juanita and Stern, with Reinsdorf at the send.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of media representatives from around the world were
present. So were several teammates from last year, although not
Scottie Pippen, whom Jordan met Monday night to tell him the news.
</P>
<P>
   The news is bad not only for the Bulls but also the NBA, which
needs Jordan's stately presence and appeal as it attempts to
recover from a six-month labor dispute that has disenchanted fans.
But saving the league was not Jordan's responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to survive without Michael Jordan is to live without
him,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the NBA spotlight, Jordan hopes his life will gain some
sense of normalcy, but he's not counting on it. No matter where he
goes, he expects to be beseiged by adoring fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot about my lifestyle I truly don't like,'' he said
without naming specifics. ``But I learned to deal with it. . . .
Hopefully, (the popularity) will subside some. . . . But I don't
think I can go into seclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf presented Jordan with his final championship ring and
re-unveiled his retired jersey No. 23, which was first put up in
the rafters in 1995 but wqas taken down at Jordan's request when he
came back.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no comeback likely this time, as Jordan leaves
behind a league in flux.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game,'' he said, ``is a lot bigger than Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.

 &HT;    Strong appeal for Dole as GOP candidate
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Some potential GOP presidential candidates have
been campaigning for years in this bellwether state, but two
noncandidates have jumped way ahead of the pack _ George W. Bush
and Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   In a presidential election cycle when Republican voters could
face a long list of candidates running to the right (including Pat
Buchanan and Dan Quayle), Dole is shaping up as Bush's major
challenger for the middle ground. In addition to competing for
votes, though, Dole and Bush would be competing for money,
volunteers and staffers aligned with the moderate wing of the
Republican Party. In that fight, momentum counts for a lot, and
right now, Dole has it.
</P>
<P>
   Now the folks who immerse themselves in New Hampshire primary
politics are watching to see if Dole is more than a passing
sensation. ``Those names have a lot of political equity here in the
state,'' pollster Kelly Myers of Portsmouth said of Bush and Dole.
The Bush or Dole name has been on every GOP ticket since the 1976
race when Bob Dole was Gerald Ford's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Myers' poll, conducted for a Manchester TV station, puts Dole
and Bush way out front, each with about a third of the vote, and a
pack of other candidates with less than 7 percent each. Dole won
support from 31 percent of the 576 respondents contacted Jan. 8-11
for the WMUR poll, which has a margin of error of 4.1 percentage
points. Bush got 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the numbers dropped precipitously. Arizona Sen. John
McCain was third at 7 percent. Steve Forbes was at 5 percent, New
Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith was at 4 percent, Dan Quayle and Pat
Buchanan were at 3 percent, Lamar Alexander was at 2 percent and
John Kasich was at 1 percent. Tom Rath, a Concord lawyer and head
of the Alexander effort in New Hampshire, said the poll merely
captured the novelty of a possible Elizabeth Dole candidacy. She
resigned from the Red Cross last week, a move that touched off
speculation that she would run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week was all Elizabeth, all the time,'' Rath said. He
said Bush's popularity comes from his name, made famous by his job
as Texas governor and his father's former job as president.
</P>
<P>
   While Dole was garnering publicity, Bush had good things to say
about her as a contender and said her decision on whether to run
would have no bearing on his plans.
</P>
<P>
   Though the poll numbers come more than a year before New
Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary, they come in a key state
that has a history of picking winners. Only twice since 1952 has
the winner of the GOP primary here failed to get the GOP
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a firestorm,'' New Hampshire GOP Chairman Steve
Duprey said of Dole's sudden rise.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire's Republican House Speaker Donna Sytek, who has
been taking a hard look at Bush, said she is now ``excited about
the prospect'' of Dole jumping in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd sure like to talk to those two people before I make a
decision,'' said Sytek, an Alexander backer in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Duprey, who will remain neutral in the primary, said Republicans
``are looking for new voices and new faces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'll tell you what we are looking for more than anything
else, and that is a winner. I think people are excited by the
prospect of Elizabeth Dole,'' he said, noting that she is
well-known here through her speeches on husband Bob Dole's behalf
in 1996. ``The same is true, to a lesser degree, with Governor
Bush, who was up here campaigning for his dad all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Bush supporters here are awaiting word on whether he
will run, Dole's potential candidacy is being championed here this
week by Earl Cox, a South Carolinian who has been running a draft
Dole movement for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   A similar Cox effort to get Colin Powell to run in 1996 failed.
</P>
<P>
   Cox is a former top official at the federal departments of
labor, agriculture and commerce in the Nixon, Ford and Reagan
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   For Cox, here to huddle with New Hampshire GOP officials,
victory _ interpreted as Dole getting in the race _ is near.
</P>
<P>
   Her resume _ devoid of any races for elected office _ is a plus,
Cox said. If she runs, Dole would be attempting to become the first
president since Dwight Eisenhower to win the White House without
ever holding elected office.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we have many good candidates that are running on the
Republican ticket, I believe that Elizabeth Dole would come into
the political arena with no baggage whatsoever,'' he said. ``When
the closets are opened up by reporters there will be no skeletons
jumping out.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her Red Cross post, Dole served as secretary of
transportation in the Reagan administration, and secretary of labor
in the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   Though pleased that he is finding Republicans receptive to a
Dole candidacy, Cox is going out of his way not to say anything
negative about Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is a gentleman and I think he has a lot to offer,
and I think it would be a good idea for George Bush to add his name
to the ballot,'' Cox said. ``It's not that Elizabeth Dole is better
than Governor Bush or any of the other candidates, but it just so
happens she reflects my personal views.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In 30-plus years in the political arena, with the exception of
Ronald Reagan, I have never, ever seen the enthusiasm for a
potential candidate as I have for Elizabeth Dole,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though intrigued by her possible candidacy, several top
Republicans here say privately her best hope is to wind up as the
GOP's vice presidential candidate. Despite the latest poll,
insiders see Bush as a prohibitive _ if early _ favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Dole also could face a gender hurdle, according to a longtime
GOP activist here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if she is really strong enough to be president,''
said the activist, a woman. ``She is sort, and I like her, really a
Southern belle-style type of woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what anybody says,'' she added. ``You are still
going to have difficulty getting a women elected as president. I
think she make it better as a vice president than she can as
president.''

<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Challenged by adversaries at home and
nervous investors abroad, the Brazilian government devalued the
nation's currency on Wednesday, allowing it to fall by more than 8
percent and triggering turbulence in financial markets around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The action came after the surprise resignation of the president
of the central bank and a week of precipitous declines in the stock
market. In the first 12 minutes of trading on Wednesday, the key
Bovespa index dropped a stunning 10 percent, setting off an
automatic shutdown of trading. After the market reopened, shares
recovered somewhat, ending the day down 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty here revived investors' fears that Brazil's
renewed difficulties could create problems in neighboring
countries, undermine the International Monetary Fund's rescue
efforts or even lead to currency realignments throughout the
developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Since Russia's devaluation and partial debt default in August,
foreign investors and Government officials have expressed concern
that Brazil could also implode and drag the rest of Latin America
down with it, especially its partners in the Mercosur trading bloc,
notably Argentina. Brazil, the eighth-largest economy in the world,
is the locomotive for Latin American economies, which now absorb
one-fifth of United States exports.
</P>
<P>
   Stock markets in Europe dropped 3 to 5 percent on Wednesday and
elsewhere in Latin America by as much as 10 percent on the Brazil
news. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 125.12
points. although broader indexes cut their losses as the session
wound down. United States Treasury bonds, long regarded as a haven
for investors at times of trouble, surged in value.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question now is one of the credibility of the
government,'' said Edmar Bacha, a former government official, who
is now president of BBA Securities. ``The first impression of the
markets is: `Here we go; it's Mexico in December 1994 all over
again. They've opened the door, and there will be a flood.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bacha alluded to Mexico's decision late in 1994 to stop
defending its currency, the peso, as it was running out of dollars
amid a worsening imbalance in its foreign trade accounts. The peso
_ which was allowed to float at market value _ plunged, unnerving
foreign investors and pushing Mexico into a deep and painful
financial and economic crisis requiring an American-led bailout.
</P>
<P>
   While Brazil has not followed Mexico's path, it has resisted
suggestions that it devalue. So investors viewed the sharp drop in
the Brazilian currency, the real, on Wednesday as an ominous sign
that this devaluation could lead to a similar pattern. The
devaluation eases pressure on the Brazilian Government to spend its
reserves and keep interest rates high to defend the currency's
value. The Government described the action as a way to restore
consumer confidence and credibility among investors.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Lopes, the newly designated president of the central
bank, opted for what Paulo Mallman, chief economist of Bic Banco in
Sao Paulo, called ``high-risk surgery.'' Since 1994, one key to
Brazil's economic growth and reduced inflation rate has been a
rigidly controlled and carefully calibrated exchange policy for the
nation's currency, the real. That will now be discarded in favor of
a more flexible approach, but one that is less predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central bank should not be concerned with eventual
corrections in the real exchange rate,'' Lopes said on Wednesday at
a news conference in Brasilia. ``We believe that the real rate of
exchange is a phenomenon that should be determined by market forces
and should not be an objective of the central bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopes ruled out a maxi-devaluation, like the one in Mexico,
however, saying that would merely generate greater inflation,
traditionally the principal bugaboo of the Brazilian economy. He
estimated that Brazil had $45 billion in reserves and said the
government was willing to use both that money and interest rate
policy to defend what it considered a reasonable exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   The new central bank head predicted that ``the maximum nominal
devaluation this year should remain between 12 and 15 percent.''
That would be approximately double the target of roughly 7 percent
that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and his team set _ and
largely adhered to _ during their first term in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an atmosphere of sparks in the air, of anxiety,
speculation and suspicion of the government's ability to make good
its commitments to the IMF,'' Mallman said. ``People believed in
the stability of the exchange policy, and that confidence has now
been broken a bit. Everything that is going on leaves people
feeling less secure and more apprehensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about Congress' unwillingness to approve legislation
that Cardoso says is essential to reduce the huge government
deficit have also contributed to uneasiness here.
</P>
<P>
   In a boost to Cardoso, legislators approved four important
measures on Wednesday afternoon that would, among other things,
impose new taxes on financial transfers and corporate profits. The
measures are expected to generate more than $3 billion in revenues
and make up for shortfalls in other areas where the government has
been unable to carry out changes because of opposition resistance.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton said he and members of his
economic team were closely monitoring the crisis in Brazil and had
been in contact with Brazilian authorities, the International
Monetary Fund and U.S. allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a strong interest in seeing Brazil, with whom we have
worked on so many important things around the world, carry forward
with its economic reform plan and succeed, and we certainly hope
that they will,'' Clinton told reporters at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso, who began his second four-year term on Jan. 1,
dismissed as unreasonable any fears that Brazil could default on
the commitments it has made. ``The government has the means to meet
all of its obligations,'' he said. ``The government will always
honor all its internal and external obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Cardoso described the latest measures as
a ``technical modification'' rather than a fundamental shift of
policy. ``This does not signify a change of direction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that explanation fell on deaf ears. Though banks here
continued to sell dollars at the very peak of the new trading band
established by the government, 1.32 reals to the dollar, most
currency exchanges were refusing to sell dollars at any price,
expecting that the real will weaken even further in days to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly not a good sign that the real immediately went
to the ceiling of the new band,'' said Carlos Geraldo Langoni, a
former president of the central bank. ``This is an attempt to save
the existing exchange rate regimen, but its success depends on the
evaluation the market makes, so we will have to wait 15 days or
so.''

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SAO PAULO, Brazil _ The Brazilian oil monopoly is finally
breaking up. The first joint venture deal was sealed last October
between the giant holding Petrobras and Argentina's oil company
YPF. The value of the contract, US$20 million, may be relatively
small, but this is only a hors d'oeuvre. Another partnership of
limited scope was established between Petrobras and U.S.-based
energy companies Coastal Corp. and Unocal, with initial investment
of $30 million.
 &HT;    ``Brazil offers significant investment opportunities for
Coastal,'' Coastal Chairman and CEO David Arledge said after the
agreement was announced.
 &HT;    The new petroleum regulatory agency has also announced which
fields will be open to free competition in the near future. The
state-owned giant will keep those areas where production has
already started, as well as several others where it has substantial
investment in research. But all in all, 90 percent of Brazilian
sedimentary basins will be opened to competition.
 &HT;    Tender documents were scheduled to be released by the end of
1998, with auctions for exclusive prospect and exploration rights
taking place in 1999, says David Zylbersztajn, director general of
the National Petroleum Agency (ANP). The new controllers of the
fields will then have three years to produce results.
 &HT;    Zylbersztajn expects more than $500 million from the first round
of auctions, and up to $7 billion in private investment in the next
five years.
 &HT;    Private cash is desperately needed. Brazil has boasted reserves
of 16 billion barrels, but most of them are located offshore in
deep waters, which make development very costly. Local production
is on the rise, but the current level of one million barrels per
day (bpd) still falls far short of average consumption, amounting
to 1.6 million bpd. The objective of the current opening policy is
to double Brazilian reserves and to guarantee self-sufficiency.
 &HT;    Zylbersztajn says that the equivalent of a further 90 billion
barrels could be discovered in Brazil, according to current
surveys. Most of the 29 sedimentary basins have remained unexplored
so far. Petrobras cannot meet the massive investment requirement
alone. All state-owned companies have seen their budgets slashed as
the result of the latest austerity drive.
 &HT;    While privatization is not formally on the government agenda,
Zylbersztajn has not ruled it out. ``It is a possibility,'' says
the 44-year-old director of the ANP, who had previously engineered
the privatization process of utilities in the state of S ao Paulo.
 &HT;    Although some 80 multinational oil companies have set up or
bolstered their presence in Rio de Janeiro in anticipation of the
new oil rush, progress toward formal commitments by the major
companies has been slower than anticipated.
 &HT;    ``Things are not happening as quickly as expected,'' says
Edmilson Santos, a professor at the oil department of the
University of Sao Paulo. ``Nor have they involved huge amounts of
money so far.''
 &HT;    The $1.5 billion that YPF has committed in investment is
targeted towards distribution, through the launch of a joint gas
station network with Petrobras both in Brazil and in Argentina.
``YPF has to get into Brazil. It is strategic for them. But that is
not enough for the others to follow,'' adds Santos.
 &HT;    There are two Brazilian factors and one external one that help
explain such caution. First, concession contracts have established
a period of three years for exploration rights, which is
deemedinsufficient by international investors. The ANP's
Zylbersztajn has admitted that this item may be reviewed. Second,
the level of taxation is deemed too high, at around 55 percent of
total revenue. Royalties were increased from 5 percent to 10
percent of sales with the market opening, and there are three other
categories of levies. Finally, investment risk in Brazil has
significantly increased.
 &HT;    Still, oil investors are thinking long term and have retained
their positive outlook. ``We have four or five contracts under
negotiations with Petrobras, but we will also compete in further
areas at the forthcoming government auctions,'' YPF President
Roberto Monti said during the signing ceremony in October. Added
Arledge: ``We firmly believe this will be the first of many
projects to be developed by Coastal in the years to come.''

 RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil: or so.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The crisis began late last week, when Itamar Franco, the newly
sworn-in governor of Brazil's second most populous state, Minas
Gerais, announced a 90-day moratorium on repayment of the $13.5
billion in debt his state owes to the national government. The
action generated fears here and overseas that other states might
follow suit and that Cardoso would be unable to comply with the
terms of the $41.5 billion rescue package the International
Monetary Fund announced in November.
</P>
<P>
   The Sao Paulo stock market immediately took a drastic plunge,
and in less than a week it has lost nearly a quarter of its value.
Looking for a safe haven abroad, investors on Tuesday sent $1.2
billion out of the country, thereby rekindling fears of a massive
drain on reserves that had been calmed in November by the IMF
package, after Brazil lost nearly half the $75 billion it had in
reserves before the Russian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLOS)
</P>
<P>
   While events of the past week have plunged stock brokers,
bankers and economists into a virtual state of panic, ordinary
Brazilians seem less alarmed by the situation. It is the middle of
summer here, and Rio's beaches and streets were crowded on
Wednesday with vacationers and shoppers looking ahead to next
month's Carnival celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are being laid off left and right, and prices are sky
high,'' said Carlos Eduardo Braga Cavalcanti, while sipping a beer
at beachfront snack stand Wednesday night. ``We're going to have
all year to think about those problems, because they're not going
to disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso, who cut short his own beach vacation to return to the
capital, urged Brazilians to remain calm and said his government
would stay the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential Brazil continue with changes in our fiscal
regime,'' he said, adding that reform measures already approved by
Congress have led to ``a marked advance'' in Brazil's long-term
economic health.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso and his advisers hope that the changes in exchange-rate
policy will, if successful, allow them to reduce interest rates,
which reached nearly 50 percent last year. Those punishingly high
rates are perhaps the principal reason that the Brazilian economy
has been pushed into a recession, which is expected to continue at
least into the middle of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's remarks and policies immediately came under
fire from an opposition that has been emboldened by Franco's
challenge to the authority of the federal government. The leader of
one opposition party, Leonel Brizola, praised Franco as ``a symbol
of national resistance'' and urged Cardoso to step down, while the
president's principal opponent in last fall's election, Luis Inacio
da Silva of the Worker's Party, said the problem went far beyond
Franco's act of defiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreign investors have never heard of Minas Gerais,'' he said.
``Their problem is a lack of confidence in the direction of the
Brazilian economy. The whole economic team has to be changed,
because Francisco Lopes is not going to change anything in the
current orientation of the central bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopes, one of the architects of economic policy for the past
five years, replaces Gustavo Franco, who will remain in the
government as a member of Cardoso's council of economic advisers.
Economists and other analysts here said that Franco stepped down
because he preferred a more rigid exchange policy as a means to
enforce economic discipline but that on many other issues the two
men are in basic agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lopes is as conservative and orthodox as Franco is and has
better personal relationships within the government and with
Congress,'' said Bacha, president of BBA Securities. ``Once the
market sees this, things will improve.''

 Por THIERRY OGIER 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SAO PAULO, Brasil _ Por fin se desmantela el monopolio petrolero
de Brasil. El primer acuerdo de empresa conjunta se sello en
octubre pasado entre el enorme holding Petrobras y la petrolera
argentina YPF. El valor del contrato, US$20 millones, quiza sea
relativamente pequeno, pero es solo un aperitivo. Otra sociedad de
alcance limitado se establecio entre Petrobras y las
electrogeneradoras estadounidenses Coastal Corp. y Unocal, con una
inversion inicial de US$30 millones.
 &HT;    ``Brasil ofrece importantes oportunidades de inversion para
Coastal,'' dijo David Arledge, presidente del directorio y
presidente ejecutivo de Coastal, al anunciarse el convenio.
 &HT;    La nueva entidad normativa del sector petrolero tambien ha
anunciado que campos se abriran a la libre competencia en el futuro
cercano. El coloso estatal conservara las areas donde ya ha
comenzado la produccion, asi como otras donde ha hecho grandes
inversiones en investigacion. En general, el 90 por ciento de las
cuencas sedimentarias de Brasil se abriran a la competencia.
 &HT;    La publicacion de los documentos de subasta estaba planificada
para finales de 1998, y la licitacion de los derechos exclusivos de
prospeccion y exploracion tendra lugar este ano, dice David
Zylbersztajn, director general de la Agencia Nacional del Petroleo
(ANP). Los nuevos controladores de los campos tendran entonces tres
anos para mostrar resultados.
 &HT;    Zylbersztajn espera mas de US$500 millones en la primera ronda
de subastas y hasta US$7.000 millones en inversiones privadas en
los proximos cinco anos.
 &HT;    Hay una gran necesidad de capital privado. Brasil tiene reservas
de 16.000 millones de barriles, pero la mayor parte esta frente a
la costa, a gran profundidad, lo que hace que el desarrollo sea muy
costoso. La produccion local crece, pero el nivel actual de un
millon de barriles por dia (bpd) no cubre el consumo promedio de
1,6 millones de bpd. El objetivo de la politica de apertura es
duplicar las reservas y garantizar el autoabastecimiento.
 &HT;    Zylbersztajn dice que en Brasil podria descubrirse el
equivalente de 90.000 millones de barriles mas, segun prospecciones
recientes. La mayor parte de las 29 cuencas sedimentarias todavia
no se han explorado. Petrobras no puede hacer la enorme inversion y
todas las empresas estatales han sufrido una reduccion de
presupuesto debido a las medidas de austeridad.
 &HT;    Aunque la privatizacion no figura oficialmente en la agenda del
gobierno, Zylbersztajn no la ha descartado. ``Es una posibilidad,''
indica el director de la ANP, que dirigio el proceso de
privatizacion de las empresas de servicio publico en el estado de
Sao Paulo.
 &HT;    Aunque unas 80 petroleras multinacionales se han establecido o
fortalecido su presencia en Rio de Janeiro, previendo la nueva
fiebre petrolera, no se ha avanzado lo que se esperaba en el logro
de compromisos formales con las grandes companias internacionales.
 &HT;    ``Las cosas no se estan moviendo a la velocidad esperada,''
comenta Edmilson Santos, profesor de la Universidad de Sao Paulo.
``Tampoco han llegado grandes sumas de dinero.''
 &HT;    Los US$1.500 millones que YPF ha fijado como inversion se
destinan a la distribucion a traves de la creacion de una red
conjunta de gasolineras con Petrobras en Brasil y en Argentina.
``YPF tiene que entrar en Brasil. Para ellos es una cuestion
estrategica. Pero eso no basta para que otros sigan la pauta,''
agrega Santos.
 &HT;    Hay dos factores brasilenos y uno externo que explican esa
precaucion. En primer lugar, los contratos de concesiones han
establecido un periodo de tres anos para los derechos de
exploracion, que los inversionistas internacionales consideran
insuficiente. Zylbersztajn, de ANP, ha admitido que se puede
revisar el periodo. En segundo lugar, el nivel de impuestos se
considera demasiado alto: alrededor del 55 por ciento del total de
ingresos. Los derechos se incrementaron del 5 por ciento al 10 por
ciento de las ventas con la apertura del mercado y hay otras tres
categorias de impuestos. Por ultimo, aunque no necesariamente en
ese orden, el riesgo de invertir en Brasil ha aumentado
notablemente.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, los inversionistas en el sector petrolero piensan a
largo plazo y mantienen su optimismo. ``Estamos negociando cuatro
de cinco contratos con Petrobras, pero tambien competiremos en
otras areas en las proximas subastas gubernamentales,'' dijo el
presidente de YPF, Roberto Monti, en la ceremonia de la firma en
octubre. Y Arledge agrego: ``Creemos firmemente que este sera el
primero de muchos proyectos que Coastal desarrollara en los
proximos anos.''

WEST REACTS TO SUPREME COURT RULING ON BALLOT INITIATIVES  
(RK)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Idaho, Nev., Ore., S.D.)   By JAMES BROOKE c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ In the West, the populist cradle of the ballot
initiative movement, a new Supreme Court ruling rejecting curbs on
petition circulators was hailed Wednesday by issue advocates as a
move toward greater democracy and denounced by state legislators as
commercializing a grass-roots process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have businesses coming here from out of state
and setting up major operations,'' said Ray Powers, the Republican
president of the state Senate in Colorado, where eight initiatives
were on the ballot in November. ``Now if you have $400,000, you can
get your issue on the ballot with paid circulators and into law
with 30-second sound bites. That's not a true citizens'
initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling that affects most of the nation's 24 states with
ballot initiative laws, the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional on
Tuesday a Colorado law that required people who circulate petitions
to be registered to vote. Similar rules are on the books in 14
other states.
</P>
<P>
   The court also rejected a Colorado law requiring that petition
circulators wear identification badges specifying whether they are
paid or volunteer workers. Idaho has a similar law. Finally, the
court rejected a law here that required initiative backers to file
monthly reports identifying paid circulators and how much they are
paid. It is unclear how many other states have such laws.
</P>
<P>
   Although ballot initiatives first began in this country in 1898,
in South Dakota, this political tool only became popular in recent
years. In the 1990s, there have been 312 initiatives, compared with
88 in the 1960s. Controversial questions have been forced onto
ballots, often with help from out-of-state businesses that recruit
and pay petition circulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upside is that you are going to see more people
undertaking initiatives for the 2000 election,'' said Dane Waters,
president of the Initiative and Referendum Institute, a
Washington-based nonprofit study group. ``The downside is that
state legislatures are going to look to new restrictions on the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   State legislators, Waters said, are already debating
restrictions such as residency requirements for signature
collectors or requirements that voters approve ballot initiatives
by two-thirds instead of a simple majority. Last year, for example,
Utah voters approved a referendum prepared by the Legislature that
mandated a two-thirds majority to pass all initiatives dealing with
the taking of wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunters are strong in state legislatures and now they are
raising the bar to an impossibly high standard,'' said Wayne
Pacelle, senior vice president of the Humane Society of the United
States. ``We have had about a dozen successes since 1990, and now
they want to block us from future successes through the initiative
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Many state legislators and officials make little secret of their
distaste for ballot initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fear that this is direct democracy run amok,'' said
William T. Pound, director of the National Conference of State
Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Oregon led the nation with 10 ballot initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``For $100,000 you can put just about anything on the ballot in
Oregon,'' said Neil Bryant, a Republican and chairman of the State
Senate Judiciary Committee. ``They just go to the three busiest
shopping malls and gather all the signatures they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer going through the legislative process where you have
hearings and debates, instead of the ballot process where it is
one-sided. A democracy is not intended to be efficient or quick. It
is a slower, deliberative process.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, which had seven ballot initiatives last year,
Bill Jones, the Republican secretary of state, said Wednesday: ``By
being able to pay people to gather signatures, the initiative
process has turned into a cottage industry in California. It has
changed from a grass-roots concept to a major business where these
companies that collect signatures go from election to election.''
</P>
<P>
   But issue advocates say that professional signature gatherers
are needed because of hurdles placed by state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California, you need over 400,000 signatures in 150 days,''
said Bill Zimmerman, executive director of Americans for Medical
Rights, a Santa Monica-based nonprofit organization that advocates
the legalization of marijuana for medical purposes. ``It is
impossible to do it without them.''
</P>
<P>
   Calculating that $3 billion was spent on candidate races
nationwide last year, Zimmerman said of the California secretary of
state, ``It is silly to point at the initiative process as
commercialized when you are part of a candidate process that is far
more commercialized.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Supreme Court ruling had been in effect one year ago,
Zimmerman said, medical marijuana initiatives would have been on
the ballot last November in Colorado and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Arnold, president of National Voter Outreach Inc., one of
half a dozen companies that uses professionals to gather
signatures, said that his business would not exist if state
legislators did not create so many barriers to ballot initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a state is interested in making the system more populist,
they need to make it less restrictive,'' he said from his office in
Carson City, Nev. ``Anytime states make the process more difficult,
they make it more certain that they have to hire companies like
mine to get on the ballot.''

DEATH OF 8-YEAR-OLD A TESTAMENT TO VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BRIDGEPORT, Conn. _ He died at the top of the stairs, a little
boy who had seen what little boys should never see, shot in the
head after a routine run to the grocery store with his mother, who
was killed by bullets from the same gun.
</P>
<P>
   He loved basketball. He prided himself on dressing well. He
proudly displayed the products of an after-school crafts program _
treasured trinkets that his mother would fawn over when she picked
him up after work.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and friends recall two things about 8-year-old Leroy
Brown Jr., this city's heartbreaking, terrible testament to
violence: He had a disarming smile that drew friends like a magnet.
And he was familiar with the flash of gunshots and the smell of
gunpowder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leroy was happy, enthusiastic. You'd see him bounce through
this neighborhood all the time,'' said Ronald Reed, a 16-year-old
junior at Bridgeport's Central High School, standing just yards
from where the bodies of Brown and his mother, 30-year-old Karen
Clarke, were discovered Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a typical, fun-loving 8-year-old,'' said Reed, staring
off blankly, his voice barely a whisper. ``What can you say? He'd
probably be still here if he hadn't seen what happened that day.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Leroy Brown and his mother is the talk of
Connecticut, where lawmakers are urgently reviewing guidelines
designed to safeguard witnesses, where police in the state's
largest city are investigating links to what Leroy saw and how he
was slain, and where family members are planning a funeral that
probably won't answer this simple, haunting question: Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of us were prepared for something like
this,'' said the Rev. Courtney Williams, pastor of Refuge Temple
Church of God, where the mother-and-son funeral will be held
tonight. ``This act transcends race, culture, and even religion.
We're living in a very bad world that has just become so corrupt.
So corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   The bloody trail that ended at a cedar-shingled duplex with a
basketball hoop in the driveway and a burglar-alarm notice on the
steps may have begun with a petty dispute over money that
culminated in gunfire on a September night in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It was the day after Labor Day, and Leroy Brown was just along
for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   According to police and court documents, Brown, then 7, sat in
the back seat of a white Eagle Talon with another 7-year-old. The
boys had been at the Boys &AMP; Girls Club of Bridgeport, where they
played hoop and painted pictures. Karen Clarke's boyfriend and
intended husband, Rudolph Snead Jr., had picked them up at about 6
p.m. He was driving down Boston Avenue when a burgundy Chevy with
dark tinted windows pulled alongside.
</P>
<P>
   Snead told police that Russell Peeler, with whom he had argued
two weeks before, sat in the front passenger seat of the Chevrolet.
Snead sped off to evade Peeler, but by the time the cars had
reached Lindley Street, gunshots rang out. Police found a bullet
hole in the driver's side door. Another round grazed Snead's head.
Shattered glass littered Snead's car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both children appeared traumatized and were unwilling to talk
about the incident,'' a warrant for Peeler's arrest reads.
``Neither of the children complained or appeared to have been
injured during the shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Snead later told authorities Peeler had leaned out his window
and begun firing at him from ``about a foot away'' _ close enough
for a back seat passenger to get a good look.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, little Leroy Brown had become a key witness in a case
of attempted murder, the charge authorities lodged against Peeler,
who was swiftly released on bail and just as swiftly reportedly
began making threats against Snead.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke told authorities that Peeler repeatedly vowed ``to get''
Snead. And that's exactly what happened, police said, eight months
after the drive-by shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities allege that Peeler, who turns 27 tomorrow, and
Snead, 28, met again on Boston Avenue, this time last May 29 in a
crowded barbershop.
</P>
<P>
   It was raining outside, and when the door opened, according to
witnesses, a black man holding a Glock semiautomatic handgun in his
left hand walked directly to the back of the shop where Snead was
on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This person then pointed a gun at Snead,'' court papers state.
``Snead was heard to say, `Oh man, go ahead with that (expletive).'
The person then fired several shots point blank at Snead.''
</P>
<P>
   After the gunman left, one witness said Snead gasped to
onlookers: ``It was Russell, yo.'' The witness said Snead ``was
trying to tell the people still in the shop that this was the
person who shot him.'' Snead died at Bridgeport Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Another eight months would elapse before still more gunshots
would evoke the Peeler and Snead case _ weeks of court rulings and
personal decisions that have led to a call for a statewide overhaul
of how Connecticut deals with those who commit crimes and those who
witness them.
</P>
<P>
   With Snead gunned down, Leroy Brown was the remaining witness to
the earlier drive-by shooting _ an episode authorities hope to link
to the barbershop slaying through testimony and forensic evidence
that, they say, shows the same gun was used in both attacks. The
other boy riding in the back seat with Leroy had apparently not
seen enough to be a witness, although authorities have now
contacted his parents to offer him protection, according to the
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, police moved to protect Brown, too. Clarke, who
worked in the traffic department at a U-Haul dealership in nearby
Orange, Conn., moved last summer into the duplex on Earl Avenue, a
dead-end street in a working-class neighborhood. She transferred
Leroy to a new school. For a while, police patrols were assigned to
keep watch over them.
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, Clarke concluded the police patrols were a
neighborhood nuisance and asked that they be stopped. Critics of
the authorities' handling of the case say it is far from clear that
Clarke made that request. In any event, police surveillance was
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   That decision and a judge's ruling to let Peeler _ already out
on bail for the attempted murder charge _ post a $900,000 bail
after Snead's killingWednesday prompted a call Wednesday from
leading state lawmakers to heighten surveillance of suspects out on
bail and to streamline Connecticut's witness protection program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the state determined that this child was an eyewitness,
they placed him in harm's way. As a state and as a society, we
failed and we failed miserably,'' said state Representative
Christopher Caruso, a Democrat from Bridgeport. ``We have to find
out where the system broke down. Young Leroy Brown is telling us a
story here and it's incumbent on us to listen to what's being
said.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Police here have been careful to say that while Peeler has
not been ruled out as a suspect in last week's killings, neither is
he a main suspect. Peeler, who is required to wear an electronic
monitoring bracelet as a condition of bail, has denied through his
attorney and family members any involvement in the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Post, quoting sources, has described Peeler as a
member of a local drug gang, and said he was spotted outside the
home of Clarke and Brown just days before they were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies, found a few feet apart, were discovered after
Clarke's co-worker got worried when she did not show up for work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to be some kind of animal to do what he did, is all I
can tell you,'' said Louis Messina, a 79-year-old crossing guard at
Read School, where Leroy was a third-grader. ``Anyone who does that
to an 8-year-old deserves to be hanged. To tell you the truth,
Bridgeport is going down. It used to be one of the best cities in
the whole state of Connecticut, but now people are scared.''

<P>
   Rev. Williams said that when authorities searched the duplex,
they found Clarke's Bible on her bedstand open to the book of
Psalms, Chapter 20, which begins: ``The Lord hear thee in the day
of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty sad that this young boy and Karen had to be
sacrificed in order to get the attention of our lawmakers,''
Williams said. ``Perhaps this will bring about a change in our laws
that will bring more security to our people _ not just the rich and
the famous and the upper echelons of society _ but the poor and the
disenfranchised.''

 &HT;    Falcons jab, then throw deep
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons rushed the ball 51.9 percent of
their plays this season, second-highest in the NFL, so the
perception that Dan Reeves' offense is stodgy and predictable was
perpetuated for another season.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality of the Falcons offense, as discovered by
Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Foge Fazio during his
Monday videotape review, is that the Falcons passing game has as
much ``verticality'' as any in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their signature is of a physical team, and Jamal (Anderson)
rates as one of the great backs in the league,'' Fazio said. ``But
what sometimes gets overlooked is just how accurate their
quarterback is and how well they throw deep. They want you to
commit to the run, then they sneak one of those wide receivers
behind you, usually off play-action. What most jumped out at us is
how effective they are with the deep ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons ranked sixth in both catches for 25 yards or more
(35) and yardage after the catch (1,577). But a key stat lost in
the shuffle of the Anderson-led ground stampede is that the Falcons
led the NFL in average yards per completion. Atlanta's gaudy
average of 15.8 yards was more than two yards better than runner-up
Minnesota (13.7). More significantly, it was the highest average in
the league since the Raiders posted a 16.3-yard mark in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Most teams attempt to stretch a defense down the field with
speed, using sprinters to fray the edges of the secondary. But
while Terance Mathis enhanced his quickness at age 31 by working
out with a personal trainer in the offseason, the nine-year pro
still is not regarded as a burner. And most scouts think that
partner Tony Martin has lost half a step.
</P>
<P>
   However, they share a veteran savvy that allows them to take
advantage of most coverages, and the Falcons staff does an
excellent job of picking its spots to throw the deep pass. The
success of the passing game, in fact, is as much a factor of design
as it is physical talent.
</P>
<P>
   By using Anderson as a human bludgeon, the Falcons want to force
their opponent to commit an extra man to run defense. Typically
that means bringing an eighth defender, the strong safety, closer
to the line of scrimmage. While that move allows at least one
defender to go unblocked against the run, it also creates natural
weaknesses in the secondary. The Falcons do a nice job of finding
and exploiting those voids in the pass defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you have to respect their run so much,'' Vikings
strong safety Robert Griffith said, ``you sacrifice something in
(pass) coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Viking ranked just 19th against the pass this season, for
two reasons: The secondary, especially on the corners, has been
suspect since the first day of camp, and Minnesota does not exert
much pressure with its four-man rush.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings' secondary was banged up in last week's victory.
Starting free safety Orlando Thomas aggravated a hamstring injury
and missed much of the game. Nickel cornerback Ramos McDonald also
is nursing a hamstring pull and Griffith has a strained back and
sore neck. Because of the injuries, the Vikings were forced to play
Anthony Bass, who logged only two snaps from scrimmage during the
regular season, as their nickel safety.
</P>
<P>
   The problems with the nickel might not be as severe against the
Falcons, whose third wide receivers haven't been productive.
Quarterback Chris Chandler is better in two-wideout base sets. When
Atlanta used two wideouts this season, Chandler completed 64.5
percent of his attempts and his passer rating was 117.5. With three
wideouts, he completed just 47.7 percent and his passer rating was
71.2.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons typically use a lot of maximum-protection blocking,
keeping their backs and a tight end in to insulate Chandler.

CAMPAIGN FINANCE BACKERS READY A NEW PUSH FOR OVERHAUL 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The leading congressional sponsors of legislation
to overhaul the way political campaigns are financed said Wednesday
that they would push hard for their bills this year so that new
restrictions could be in place for the elections in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But the sponsors conceded that it would be difficult for the
measures to avoid the fate of campaign finance legislation last
year, when a bill was passed by the House of Representatives but
died in a filibuster in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing for congressional aides who work on the campaign
finance issue, Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Martin Meehan,
D-Mass., said it was important to get a bill through the House
early in the year to force the Senate's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that can happen depends in large part on the attitude of
the House Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders on both sides of the Capitol adamantly oppose
the measures sponsored by Shays and Meehan in the House and by
Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell Feingold, D-Wis. The main
elements of the legislation would outlaw soft money, the unlimited
and largely unregulated donations to political parties that have
proliferated in recent election campaigns, and would curb
commercials by outside groups masked as issue advocacy
advertisements in the 60 days before elections.
</P>
<P>
   Last year House Republican leaders threw up a series of
obstacles in an effort to block campaign finance legislation. Early
in the year they prohibited the Shays-Meehan measure from being
debated during consideration of related legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after the sponsors had demonstrated that they had the
votes to bring their bill to the floor over the leadership's
opposition, the leaders made sure the bill was open to almost
limitless amendments, was forced to compete with 10 less
restrictive alternatives and was under consideration only
sporadically.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, after 10 weeks of off-and-on debate, the House
approved the Shays-Meehan bill on Aug. 3 by a comfortable margin,
237-186.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Shays said he received assurances late last
year from Rep. Robert Livingston, who was then set to become
speaker, that the bill would not face such rigorous and unusual
hurdles this year. Shays said that he had not had the opportunity
to discuss the matter with Rep. Dennis Hastert, who was elected
speaker after Livingston withdrew, but that he was confident
Hastert would take a similar view.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have proved we have the votes,'' Shays said. ``Why have it
fester and destroy good will among members? Let's get it out of
here and let the Senate deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Michele Davis, a spokeswoman for the House majority leader, Rep.
Dick Armey, R-Texas, said that campaign finance was one of the
topics on this year's agenda but that the leadership had not
focused on when or how it might be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, there is scant evidence that the sponsors'
position is much stronger than it was last year, when they were
never able to muster more than 52 votes, 8 shy of the 60 needed, to
end the Republican filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Feingold said they would introduce their bill early
in the new session. ``Clearly we're going to address the issue this
year, no doubt,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a chance for success?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a long haul,'' he said, ``but sooner or later
we're going to prevail.''

 &HT;    Volume cranked up to prepare for noise
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Falcons began preparing for Sunday's NFC
Championship Game against the Vikings in the Metrodome by placing
two large speakers on either side of the practice field Wednesday,
blaring tape of a Boeing 757 jet engine.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the loudest stadium Atlanta has played in this
season, but the tape was not any louder Wednesday than it has been
in practice before every road game this season.
</P>
<P>
   When quarterback Chris Chandler has to change plays at the line
of scrimmage Sunday, he'll do it a few ways. He'll yell changes to
his line and make hand signals to receivers and backs _ although
few of the changes impact receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, you come up with some sort of signals, and you walk
up and down behind the line telling them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler said there will not be a special effort to get out of
the huddle faster just so he has extra time to make the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much us getting out of the huddle faster, as it is
(quarterbacks coach) Jack Burns stepping up and getting the plays
in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcon offense worked against a play clock in practice
Wednesday, as usual, and worked on hand signals from coach Dan
Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   If the radios don't work Sunday, or if Chandler can't hear
backup quarterback Steve DeBerg relaying plays in once Burns calls
them to the sideline, those hand signals will be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always try to have a pretty quick rhythm. We want to give
him enough lead time where Chris can regulate his own pace _ where
he can slow down or speed up as he sees fit,'' Burns said. ``We
want him to be able to get up to the line and take time to read
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make his time frame slower by getting the plays in
slower ... it forces him to hurry. We don't want to do that at the
line of scrimmage.''
</P>
<P>
   Practice schedule
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons practiced at team headquarters in Suwanee, but if it
rains today or looks like it will, Reeves said the team will
practice at the Georgia Dome. They worked out there three times
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practice was good. Our concentration was good,'' Reeves said.
``We had some mistakes, but they were minimized.''
</P>
<P>
   Critical development
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons led the NFL in time of possession, holding the ball
an average of 33:10 per game. But if they are going to win Sunday,
they'll need to do more than just keep the ball away from a Vikings
offense that set a league record by scoring 520 points
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be a key for us,'' Reeves said, ``to come away
with seven points rather than three.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back
</P>
<P>
   The only other time the Falcons played the Vikings in the
playoffs, Minnesota won 30-24 on Jan. 9, 1983. Afterward, the late
Falcons owner and founder Rankin Smith Sr. fired coach Leeman
Bennett, who had a 46-41 record in six seasons. That stretch
included a 12-4 season in 1980, when the Falcons won their only
other NFC West title.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta made its first three playoff appearances under Bennett,
in 1978, '80 and '82. This year is just the third in 16 seasons
since that the Falcons have made it to the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Add Barrow County to the list of potential suitors if the
Falcons opt to move team headquarters. Falcons director of
corporate development Tommy Nobis met Wednesday with members of the
Barrow County Commission. Nothing is close to happening, however,
on this front. ... This will be Reeves' 15th AFC or NFC
Championship Game. He was 0-2 as a player with the Cowboys, 5-3 as
an assistant with Dallas and 3-1 as head coach of the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Whither DeBerg?
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg, who came out of a four-year retirement to resume his
playing career at age 44, said he plans to return next season. His
contract expires after this season, but he said he wants to play
again, and he'd prefer it be in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know I am (going to play),'' DeBerg said. ``I
can't think of a better place. It's too much fun.

 &HT;    Falcons fever: Atlanta's shocked, overjoyed by sudden ascent of
football team
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So maybe they lied.
</P>
<P>
   A franchise more notorious for losing than anything else in its
history hikes off to Minnesota this weekend in pursuit of a
preposterous destiny, and if this sounds like the start of the
1990s rather than the tail end, well, there you are.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Atlanta Braves first walked in 1991, the Atlanta
Falcons follow now, a disregarded urchin suddenly stalking a title,
and all the pundits, critics and armchair sociologists who
described that 1991 journey as Atlanta's once-in-a-lifetime thrill,
hah! It's happening again in the same place for some of the same
people.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not on the bandwagon by now, be prepared to scrunch in
the middle. All the window and aisle seats are long gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took some time but I think the people are getting into
it,'' said Roland Henderson, 27, nursing a late-afternoon beer at
the Racoon Lodge in Buckhead Wednesday. ``I know most of my friends
are psyched. This town is going to go nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, tell me about it in five years,'' said friend Jeff Burns
from the next stool. Burns, an old Browns fan visiting from Ohio,
is not impressed. ``What have they won?''
</P>
<P>
   The NFC West. But Burns' skepticism is a shared one, as the
Falcons' rush into the sublime has occurred while much of the
city's back was seemingly turned. Even for December games, the
Georgia Dome failed to sell out. But perhaps one man's indifference
can be another's euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fans on an overwhelming basis are tickled that the
Falcons have accomplished what they already have because to them,
it's totally unexpected,'' said former All-Pro tackle Mike Kenn,
fresh from presiding over a budget meeting in his new job as
chairman of the Fulton County Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just increases the excitement level of it. If they win _
and as long as you're in a game, you have a chance to win _ I think
that euphoria would turn into giddiness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome is an appropriate venue Sunday,
because for many, it was there the Falcons franchise lost its way
following the 1982 season. Leeman Bennett coached his last game
there in a 30-24 Vikings' first-round playoff victory that set in
motion's Bennett's firing. To many, the club only now has regained
its feet. To just a few, the promise of the Bennett regime is
glowing again.
</P>
<P>
   ``My memory's not gone to the point where I can't recall how
much fun that was,'' Kenn said. ``Anyone who has played football
for the Falcons would like to turn back the clock and be involved
in this process, no one more than I.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite periodic meddling in the postseason, nearly a generation
has passed since the Falcons' constructed a true contender. To
some, this may be the law of averages coming around. To others,
it's in the water.

CLINTON BREAKS SILENCE, SPEAKING OF LONELINESS ON TRIAL EVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, with his fate beyond his control
on the eve of opening arguments in his impeachment trial, broke his
recent silence on the political drama Wednesday and alluded to the
lonely nature of his perilous place in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion is not important here,'' said Clinton, who is not
expected to testify or directly participate in the first
presidential impeachment trial in 131 years.
</P>
<P>
   Just minutes after his lawyers filed a 130-page trial brief
arguing against his conviction, Clinton said he spends ``as little
time as possible thinking about'' the trial and can do little more
than ``trust that the right thing will be done.''
</P>
<P>
   House managers will open a three-day, nationally televised
presentation at 1 p.m. Thursday to argue that two articles of
impeachment against Clinton warrant his ``conviction, removal from
office, and disqualification from holding further office.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Senate will not vote until later this month on
whether to permit witnesses in the trial, the House managers, who
act as prosecutors, said that they already have begun trying to
interview prospective witnesses, including Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is charged with lying under oath to a federal grand jury
and obstructing justice in trying to cover up his sexual affair
with Lewinsky, who was a 22-year-old White House intern when the
relationship began.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky declined, through her lawyers, to be interviewed, the
House managers said. And they braced for criticism of their early
contacts with Lewinsky's lawyers and other prospective witnesses,
including Kathleen E. Willey, who said Clinton groped her near the
Oval Office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee is duty bound to gather all relevant evidence
and to be thoroughly prepared to present its case to the Senate,''
Paul McNulty, a spokesman for the House managers, said in a
statement  &UR; last night &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Later, Representative Henry J. Hyde, the lead manager, told
reporters he also is considering asking the Senate to invite
Clinton to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all interested in hearing from the president as a
witness,'' Hyde said. ``The question is whether we should call him
or not. That hasn't been resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House indicated that Clinton does not intend to
testify.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Clinton's lawyers, in one of their most scathing legal
briefs to date, assailed the charges against him as an excessive
response to the president's infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the final analysis,'' Clinton's lawyers wrote, ``the House
is asking the Senate to remove the president because he had a
wrongful relationship and sought to keep the existence of that
relationship private.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House lawyers added: ``The Senate has an obligation to
turn away an unwise and unwarranted misuse of the awesome power of
impeachment. If the Senate removes this president for a wrongful
relationship he hoped to keep private, for what will the House ask
the Senate to remove the next president and the next?''
</P>
<P>
   House managers, responding in a terse, four-page memorandum to a
pretrial brief the White House filed Monday, denied ``each and
every material allegation'' that Clinton's lawyers made in
rebutting the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The managers also submitted the complete record of the House
impeachment proceedings, including grand jury transcripts and tape
recordings gathered by the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr,
during the eight-month investigation into the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers, with their three-day opening arguments
scheduled to begin Tuesday, can do little this week but watch
silently as the trial unfolds amid broad public opposition to
removing the president from office and keen concern in both parties
about any political consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The White House legal team will have 24 hours over three days
next week to present its case. Under a tentative schedule, the
Senate will then have 16 hours over two days to question lawyers on
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   After that, possibly on Jan. 25, the White House is expected to
file a motion to dismiss the charges, and the House is expected to
request permission to subpoena witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Most senators and House managers believe there are too few votes
in the Senate to convict Clinton, which would require a two-thirds
majority, or 67 votes. A conviction on either charge automatically
would remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I know how David felt against Goliath,'' said
Representative Lindsey O. Graham of South Carolina, a House manager
who will argue that the charges rise to the standard of ``high
crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the senators ``keep open minds, which I believe they
will, and we can really get into the heart of the criminality here,
things may change,'' Graham said. ``It changed in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who approved his legal team's brief several days ago,
portrayed himself as largely removed from the process. ``I should
be doing my job for the country,'' he said as he met with labor
leaders at the White House to discuss his State of the Union
address next Tuesday. ``Other people should be handling the defense
and dealing with this issue, and that's what I intend to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he will not mention impeachment in the State of the
Union speech, which he will deliver just hours after his lawyers
complete their first day of defense arguments in the Senate trial.
``I think the American people have heard about that quite
extensively over the last year,'' he said. ``I think they would
like it if somebody up here were putting their interests first,
their business first, and I think that's what they expect me to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments marked a reversal of recent weeks, as White
House aides have distanced him from reporters, fearing a possible
backlash from senators if something he said were misconstrued.
</P>
<P>
   Against the trial's political backdrop, several Republican
senators who participated last week in a crucial compromise on a
blueprint for the trial Wednesday criticized some Democratic
colleagues for ``prejudging'' the case in Clinton's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats fired back. ``I suppose one could say the same thing
about Republicans,'' said Senator Kent Conrad, a North Dakota
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry, who is weighing a possible bid for the
Democratic presidential nomination, said some Republicans are
viewing the trial through a political lens, with an eye on gaining
an advantage in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of political strategy going on, all of which I
think is wrong, all of which is damaging to the Constitution, and
all of which I think will come home to roost with them when the
American people get to express their disgust the next time they go
to the polls,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   After reading the House's pretrial brief, Kerry criticized the
White House for attacking the document as ``reading like a cheap
mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kerry was not much more charitable in assessing the House's
work. ``I don't call it a cheap mystery novel,'' Kerry said. ``I
think it's a misguided, sort of strange view of a legitimate set of
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Democrat, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut,
said his colleagues should not ignore the public opinion polls,
despite their pledge to act as impartial jurors. ``Obviously no
senator should be controlled in his or her decision in this trial
by the public opinion polls,'' he said. ``But I do think it's
appropriate to take notice of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Senate guidelines, all 100 members must sit silently hour
after hour, day after day, as one House member and White House
lawyer after another argues the case, with Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist presiding. The senators also must hold all their
deliberations behind closed doors, including debate on motions and,
ultimately, on the articles of impeachment, although the votes will
be in open session.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy said he will support a motion to
permit the public to view the deliberations. Republican leaders and
some Democrats oppose the motion, which requires the approval of a
two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's enormously important that the American people be
included in this process,'' Kennedy said. ``Their involvement is
all part of the closure of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers, in their brief Wednesday, essentially
compiled a compendium of their previous arguments, although they
added details aimed at undermining the House case.
</P>
<P>
   The document relies heavily not only on legal precedents for
impeachment cases but also on the opinions of constitutional and
legal scholars, including more than 400 who signed a joint
statement against impeachment. The statement buttressed the White
House argument that the charges involve private misconduct, not
public conduct that would be impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment was never intended to be a remedy for private
wrongs,'' the lawyers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to exploit the nearly party-line impeachment votes in
the House, the lawyers added: ``The closeness and partisan division
of the votes reflect the constitutionally dubious nature of the
charges.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House lawyers also warned of a prolonged trial if the
Senate authorizes House managers to call even a single witness. And
they urged senators to consider the results of the 1996 election,
which Clinton won handily. ``The vote the American people rendered
. . . is hanging in the balance,'' the lawyers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, who will
deliver the opening statement for the House managers, remained
unswayed by the White House argument but uncertain about the
outcome. ``I think our case is very solid,'' he said, ``if people
will listen.''

<P>
   CHICAGO _ The deciding factor was not the sordid state of the
National Basketball Association after the lockout, or even an old
and bitter feud with team management. In the end, Michael Jordan
said his basketball career was over because an undeniable feeling
would not go away:
</P>
<P>
   With every challenge met, he no longer had the desire to play.
</P>
<P>
   On the same court where he spun the world on his fingertips and
brought the Chicago Bulls along for an improbable ride, Jordan
officially said goodbye Wednesday. To the franchise. To his
teammates. And, finally, to the game he helped transport to another
galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, I'm exhausted,'' Jordan said at a news conference on
the United Center floor. ``I know, from a career standpoint, I've
accomplished everything I could as an individual. Right now, I just
don't have the mental challenges that I've had in the past to
proceed as a basketball player. This is perfect time for me to walk
away from the game. And I'm at peace with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding confident and definitive about his decision, Jordan
said he had been contemplating this day in earnest since leading
the Bulls to their sixth championship in eight seasons last June.
He left the smallest window of opportunity open when he said he was
99.9 percent sure he would not return for a second time, but at 35
years old he seemed content to not play again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never say never, but 95 ... 99.9 percent I'm very secure
with my decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The news of his retirement had been expected for 48 hours, but
the actual announcement set off a flurry of reaction. From the
White House to gymnasiums across America, and in headlines around
the world, homage was paid to the most accomplished basketball
player ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's appropriate that the sports fans around America
take a day or two to `ooh' and `ahh' and hold their breath again
and be glad again,'' President Clinton said of Jordan, the
third-leading scorer in NBA history with 29,277 points.
</P>
<P>
   Said Miami Heat Coach Pat Riley, ``The NBA, the fans, the
players, the coaches, American society and history are losing the
greatest influence that sports has ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene at the United Center featured a sea of cameras,
photographers, reporters and former teammates and friends of
Jordan's. In what was referred to often as the largest retirement
event for a sports figure _ more than 500 credentials were issued
to members of the news media _ Jordan led a procession down Section
120 about 11:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Seated beside him were his wife, Juanita _ who said she expected
him to be available to carpool their children more often _ NBA
Commissioner David Stern and Bulls Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony had neither the emotion nor the reminiscing that
usually accompany such events. Jordan began by trying to put things
in perspective, sending his condolences to the family of a Chicago
police officer killed recently in the line of duty; the officer's
funeral was also Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He then made a statement: ``I am here to announce my retirement
from the game of basketball.'' And he tried to answer the obvious
question for a performer still hitting the highest notes in his
profession: why?
</P>
<P>
   Saying he began to contemplate retirement after shooting down
Utah in the NBA finals last June, Jordan said he spoke to Reinsdorf
after the season, intimating that the energy spent winning a third
straight championship had taken its toll.
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf, he said, told him to take his time deciding to make
sure that his second retirement in five years would be final. And
there was another factor in Jordan's decision: retiring on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to Patrick, I've talked to Charles, I've talked to
Karl, I've talked to all of them,'' he said of Patrick Ewing,
Charles Barkley and Karl Malone, All-Star players without a
championship. ``I'm pretty sure they feel the same. They all wanted
me to come back, just so if they win a championship they can say
they've gone through Chicago and Michael Jordan to win it. That's
the good thing about it. And they won't ever have the chance to say
that. That's why I was so glad that Magic played and Bird played
when I won my titles. Because I had to go through, to some degree,
Boston and L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick, I don't know. He won't be able to live with himself.
He can't beat Michael Jordan in a series. Charles Barkley, I told
him he would never win because he doesn't dedicate himself to
winning. All of them joked with me and hated to see the possibility
of me retiring just because they didn't have an opportunity to beat
me in the finals or get past me. That's the cute thing about
retiring. I will always hold that in high respect when I see these
guys socially.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who had taken great pains over the past year to say he
would play for no other coach than Phil Jackson and who openly
criticized General Manager Jerry Krause and Reinsdorf, did not use
the organization as a scapegoat. Instead, he praised the Bulls and
thanked Reinsdorf for the chance to play. He also said his decision
was not influenced by the six-month lockout that fostered
disenchantment among fans and resulted in the league's first work
stoppage in 52 years.
</P>
<P>
   Of the chance he would play for Jackson if he returned, Jordan
said: ``That's a big if. I retired the first time when Phil Jackson
was the coach. I think that even with Phil the coach, I would have
a tough time mentally finding the challenge for myself. I can't
really say he would have restored that.''
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Jackson said: ``For our own selfish
reasons, we never wanted to see Michael Jordan retire. He
represented our personal flights of fantasy about what great things
an individual can do, and he made it look so easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Reinsdorf: ``This is the day I hoped would never come. This
has to be the toughest day in the history of the Chicago Bulls, a
tough day for the city of Chicago, a tough day for the NBA, a tough
day for basketball fans all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern followed Reinsdorf and said: ``I disagree with Jerry. This
is a great day. The greatest basketball player in the history of
the game is getting the opportunity to retire with the grace that
described his play.''
</P>
<P>
   With the decision, the world's most prominent sports figure goes
from Air time to spare time. Jordan, who leaves with the highest
career scoring average in league history, 31.5 points, said he
would devote more time to his three children and family, and
perfect his golf game. Despite a severed tendon in his finger,
suffered when he was cutting a cigar, Jordan has agreed to play
next week in the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic in LaQuinta, Calif. He
also has an invitation to play in the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach Pro Am in
early February.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say, well, Michael doesn't have any challenges
away from the game of basketball,'' said Jordan, a five-time NBA
most valuable player. ``Well, I dispute that. Being a parent is
very challenging. If you have kids, you know that. I welcome that
challenge and I look forward to it. I will live vicariously through
my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan took his children to school Wednesday morning, and tried
to contemplate life without basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult because you're giving up something that you
truly, truly love,'' he said. ``My love for the game is very
strong. It's hard to give up that love.''

MARKETS PLUNGE, MONTHS AFTER $41.5B BAILOUT, AS BANK CHIEF QUITS

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ This time, Brazil has only itself to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The economic bandage that had been delicately holding together
Latin America's largest economy ripped open Wednesday, amid news
that Brazil's central bank chief unexpectedly resigned and that the
country devalued its currency by nearly 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's volatility reminded many of the panic that swept
through Brazil in September, when markets dived and investors
pulled billions of dollars out of the country. At the time,
Brazilian officials blamed the reaction on uncertainty created by
crises in Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-November, a few weeks after President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso was overwhelmingly reelected to a second term, the
International Monetary Fund and other lenders approved a $41.5
billion loan package for Brazil. The lenders expressed confidence
that the administration could fix the economy by reducing its
budget deficit, which now hovers around 8 percent of gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the cause of the anxiety seems rooted in
Brazil's own economic and political problems. In addition to the
instability caused by the resignation of Brazil's top bank official
and the currency devaluation, Cardoso has been unable to get
crucial constitutional reforms through the congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil's problems probably usher in a new round of global
contagion,'' Merrill Lynch chief economist Bruce Steinberg told
Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of Latin America will now fall into recession, there
could be spillover effects into other emerging markets, and
questions have to be raised about US and European growth and
earnings prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sao Paulo, the Bovespa index, Latin America's largest stock
market, reacted to the news by plunging 10 percent at Wednesday's
opening bell. The frantic sell-off triggered an electronic
circuit-breaker that suspended trading for 30 minutes. The market
ended the day down 5.05 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other Latin American markets reacted with similar fear. The
Mexico City exchange fell 4.6 percent. The Buenos Aires market in
Argentina dropped 10.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since last summer, Brazil has lost more than $40 billion in
foreign capital and another $1.2 billion left on Tuesday. During
the same period, the country's reserves have dwindled to about $35
billion from more than $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The first shock Wednesday was Gustavo Franco's resignation. He
was immediately replaced by Francisco Lopes, another highly
regarded central banker, whose first action was to allow Brazil's
currency, the real, to trade at a more flexible rate against the US
dollar. The move amounted to a devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Although the devaluation was meant to calm anxious investors,
who believed the Brazilian currency was overvalued, many saw it as
a troubling sign that the country's nagging financial problems are
getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, an opposition governor, Itamar Franco of the eastern
industrial state of Minas Gerais, stopped payments on state loans,
and demanded that the Cardoso government refinance the state's $15
billion debt. Two other states have threatened to stop loan
payments. That has raised more concerns about political support for
Cardoso, who succeeded Franco as president, and about whether
Brazil will be able to keep its deficit-cutting commitments as part
of its agreement to the IMF package.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government will honor all its domestic and foreign
contracts,'' Cardoso asserted in a nationally televised speech
Wednesday from Brasilia, the nation's capital. ``Rules are made to
be followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Campos, a Sao Paulo-based economist, said that although
the Brazilian economy remains fairly strong, the Cardoso government
may be forced to take further action to avoid continued capital
flight and market losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take more than simply replacing the top person at the
central bank,'' said Campos. Cardoso ``will either have to force
the opposition to go along or be flexible enough to negotiate with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, which went through its own currency crisis in 1994
and has suffered recently from record-low oil prices, the impact of
Wednesday's events were felt immediately. Mexico's currency, the
peso, weakened so much against the dollar that the central bank
stepped in to protect it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico has more discipline in its economic and fiscal
structure that it seems Brazil is trying to achieve,'' one Mexican
central bank official said Wednesday on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't mean we don't feel instability,'' the
official said. ``Just that we have less reason to panic right
now.''

MARKETS STRUGGLE TO DEAL WITH BRAZIL SITUATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The global economic crisis returned with a vengeance
Wednesday as Brazil flirted anew with a financial disaster that US
policy makers and others seemed powerless to avert.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin American nation has been struggling, with the
assistance of a $41.5 billion, US-orchestrated aid package, to
protect its currency from the kind of economy-destroying assault
that has swept Asia and other developing regions over the past 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort proved so politically painful by Wednesday that
the nation's central bank president abruptly quit; his successor
agreed to let the country's currency, the real, slide 7.6 percent
against the US dollar; and traders promptly drove the currency's
value still lower.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers took heart because world financial markets were
not nearly as panicky Wednesday as they were during the last
international crisis, when Russia devalued its currency and
defaulted on foreign debt in August.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 12 percent of its
value in a matter of a few weeks, including 512 points in a single
day. By contrast, after an initial fright, during which the Dow
tumbled about 260 points, the bellwether market index recovered its
balance and finished off 125.12 points, or a mere 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But economists cautioned that the market's comparatively
tempered reaction hardly means that Brazil's problems are now
contained. Most predicted the country's troubles will push its
region into recession and will hurt already embattled US exporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is really the dominant economy in South America and its
problems will have (ripple) effects on its neighbors and therefore
on us,'' said Jeffrey J. Schott, a senior fellow with the Institute
for International Economics in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brazil bought only 2.3 percent of US exports in 1997,
the last year for which full figures are available, Central and
South America accounted for a much more substantial 21 percent of
exports, according to the Commerce Department. And while US exports
generally have grown a respectable 63 percent during the decade,
exports to the region have grown at almost twice that rate.
</P>
<P>
   Besides damaging important markets for US goods, analysts said
that there remains a danger of a repeat of last fall's brief, but
frightening global financial freeze-up. Market watchers said
Brazil's failure to right its economy could prompt investors to
give up on all but the very safest stocks and bonds, a move that
would leave developing nations without money to grow. And they
warned that a stampede from the Brazilian currency could provoke a
similar run on another overvalued currency _ China's _ a move that
could start the cycle of financial and economic disarray that
begain in Asia in mid-1997 all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A deterioration of Brazil's currency and economy would have
severe contagion effects around the world,'' said Robert D.
Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs (International) in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   In a measure of how seriously US policy makers were taking
Brazil's troubles Wednesday, President Clinton said that senior
administration officials were consulting with allies to make sure
the crisis ``will be resolved in a satisfactory way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a strong interest in seeing Brazil, with whom we have
worked on so many important things around the world, carry forward
with its economic reform plan and succeed,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   However, analysts said that there is not much the United States
can do to avert further trouble. ``They can't do much for the
actual economy, but they have to deal with the perceptions,'' said
Harvard Business School economist Robert E. Kennedy, ``so they'll
be saying a lot of soothing words today,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Further trouble in Brazil would represent a substantial setback
for US Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and his deputy, former
Harvard professor Lawrence Summers. The pair has argued vigorously
for continuing unrestricted international capital flows, which have
helped spur a global boom, but also has set the stage for the kind
of currency run that Brazil is now in danger of suffering.
</P>
<P>
   They have been sharply criticized for asserting that policy
makers could cope with trouble from increasingly volatile financial
markets by arranging rescue packages through the International
Monetary Fund like the one unveiled last month for Brazil and
earlier ones for Indonesia, Korea, Thailand and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   `It was unfortunate, predictable and extremely costly,'' Harvard
economist Jeffrey Sachs said of Brazil's latest problems. ``The IMF
has failed for a fifth straight time in a high-profile assistance
program,'' Sachs charged.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate cause of Wednesday's crisis was the unexpected
resignation of Gustavo Franco as head of Brazil's central bank. But
the stage was set last week when the governor of one of the
contry's richest states suspended debt payments to the federal
government, raising questions about whether Brazilian President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso can win budget cutbacks demanded by the
IMF as a condition for its multibillion dollar aid package.
Franco's successor, Francisco Lopes, immediately announced that he
would allow the country's currency to depreciate about 8 percent
against the dollar in a move aimed at helping the already depressed
Brazilian economy by making its exports cheaper. But he said the
central bank would fight further declines for fear of provoking
Brazil's neighbors into devaluing their currencies and beginning an
economicaly destablizing race to underprice each other.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the first signs of whether the Brazilian central
bank can hold the line on the country's currency were discouarging,
as the real slipped below the trading range set by policy makers
and the government was reportedly forced to spend $1.7 billion of
its $35 billion in foreign reserves to try to prop the currency up.
</P>
<P>
   While US investors took Brazil's new problems in stride, stocks
here still fell broadly on worries that the country's troubles will
damage profits of US firms, especially those of banks with large
loans in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of financial giant Citigroup fell 3 9/16 to 52 3/16 while
those of J.P. Morgan tumbled 5 1/4 to 106 9/16 and those of
American Express slipped 3 7/8 to 98 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   The exception was BankBoston Corp., which makes 20 percent of
its profits in Latin America and has been doing business in the
region for much of this century. Analysts said that Boston
company's long ties will help it ride out the crisis, and the bank
itself issued a press release saying it plans to ``take advantage
of market turbulence.''

U.S. CHARGES TOP LIVENT EXECUTIVES WITH FRAUD

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Garth Drabinsky, the Canadian impresario who founded
Livent Inc. and brought shows like ``Ragtime'' to Broadway, was
charged Wednesday with orchestrating a criminal fraud of hundreds
of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said that through a scheme involving
kickbacks from contractors building Livent's new theaters in New
York and Chicago and the use of two sets of accounting books,
Drabinsky and his longtime partner, Myron Gottlieb, not only lined
their own pockets but also hid losses of more than $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal charges and similar civil charges brought Wednesday
by securities regulators were the first formal government charges
brought against the two former Livent executives, who for months
have been blamed by the company's new management for its desperate
financial straits. In addition, many new details of the reputed
fraud emerged from the written complaints filed in federal court in
Manahattan.
</P>
<P>
   For example, according to the regulators' complaint, Drabinsky
and Gottlieb tried to inflate the perceived success of ``Ragtime''
in Los Angeles in 1997 by having two companies buy more than
$380,000 worth of tickets and then reimbursing them by having them
submit fake invoices for theater construction. At that time, Livent
needed the Los Angeles production of ``Ragtime'' to look
successful, regulators said, because it would soon open on
Broadway, and the company was counting on the show's New York run
to pay for a growing pile of bills.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky and Gottlieb, who both live in Toronto, where Livent
is based, immediately disputed the 16 criminal counts of fraud and
conspiracy brought by Mary Jo White, the Unted States attorney in
Manhattan, and the civil charges of securities fraud made by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. If found guilty of the charges,
the two men could could be sentenced to decades in prison and be
fined millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, Drabinsky called reporters to a room in the
Crowne Plaza Hotel in Toronto and spoke publicly for the first time
since he was suspended from his executive post in August. Reading a
statement, he blamed Michael V. Ovitz and Livent's other new
executives, who took over the company in June, for his growing
legal troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, and for reasons best known to them, new management
wanted me out,'' Drabinsky said. ``This precipitous and deliberate
action has caused incalculable pain to me and was delibertely
designed to damage my reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than run the company, new management has focused a
preponderance of its attention on bringing a civil lawsuit against
Gottlieb and me and motivating American and Canadian authorities to
take quick, ill-conceived action against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky refused to answer any questions.
</P>
<P>
   But in court papers, federal prosecutors counted Ovitz, who
invested $20 million in the company, among the victims of the two
men's fraud.
</P>
<P>
   And while Drabinsky has said that Ovitz knew about the state of
the company's accounting books before he invested in Livent,
prosecutors said Wednesday that it did not surprise them that the
fraud had continued for eight years before being discovered in
August by Ovitz's new top financial executive.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that Livent's accounting staff had worked day
and night to carefully cover up the fraudulent adjustments to the
accounting books that Drabinsky, Gottlieb and other former
executives had ordered them to make. In addition, they said,
several former Livent financial executives had lied to the
company's outside auditors about many transactions.
</P>
<P>
   According to the regulators' complaint, Gordon C. Eckstein,
Livent's former senior vice president for finance, even asked
Livent's computer staff to write a program that allowed the
accountants to make adjustments without leaving a trail. ``This
process had the effect of falsifying the books, record and accounts
of the company so completely,'' the regulators' complaint said,
``that the adjustments appeared as original transactions, and no
trace of the actual original entries remained in the company's
general ledger.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White called on Drabinsky and Gottlieb to voluntarily turn
themselves in. If they do not do so quickly, she said, prosecutors
will file documents in Canadian courts to extradite them.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their actions Wednesday, regulators also filed an
administrative complaint against Livent, which the company settled
by agreeing not to violate securities laws. Richard H. Walker,
director of the SEC's enforcement division, said that regulators
decided not to take more aggressive action because the new managers
had cooperated and had dismissed all employees that the regulators
had found to be responsible for the fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Livent, which filed for bankruptcy court
protection in November, said that the regulators' actions Wednesday
``marks an important step in efforts to move the company forward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The government's order makes clear where responsibility lies
for this regrettable matter,'' the statement said. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to the government's complaints, Drabinsky and Gottlieb
devised a kickback scheme in the early 1990s in which they had two
contractors submit false invoices to the company for millions of
dollars in construction that did not occur.
</P>
<P>
   Livent paid those fake invoices by checks signed by Drabinsky
and Gottlieb, the complaint said, and the two companies later
secretly moved about $7 million (Canadian) of that money back to
the two men's personal accounts or to a Canadian company owned by
Gottlieb.
</P>
<P>
   As for the accounting fraud, the regulators' complaint said that
Drabinsky ``generally directed'' how the improper adjustments were
made, which grew ever larger through the years. In 1996, for
example, Livent reported earnings of $14.2 million (Canadian), even
though the company actually incurred a loss of more than $20
million (Canadian).
</P>
<P>
   The improper accounting adjustments included erasing expenses
from the books at the end of a quarter so that the company would
better meet Wall Street's expectations. Those amounts would later
be moved into the next quarter's books in a continuous accounting
manipulation that the company's accountants called the ``expense
roll,'' according to the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Lee S. Richards, a lawyer for Gottlieb, said Wednesday that the
indictment against his client ``totally misconceives'' his role at
the company and charges him with matters that were not within his
responsibility. ``What is more,'' Richards said, ``the indictment
makes charges of fraud against Canadian citizens working in a
Canadian company that the prosecution can attempt to prove only
through Canadian witnesses and Canadian documents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Gottlieb looks forward to exonerating himself in the
appropriate forum,'' Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other former executives at Livent also face criminal
charges. Prosecutors charged Eckstein with one count of conspiring
with Drabinsky and Gottlieb to carry out the fraudulent accounting
scheme, which they say resulted in Livent reporting false earnings
to investors of tens of millions of dollars. And they charged Maria
M. Messina, the company's former chief financial officer, with one
count of making false statements on financial statements filed with
the SEC. Ms. Messina worked at the accounting firm of Deloitte &AMP;
Touche and audited the company's books before she was hired by
Livent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Both Eckstein and Ms. Messina have pleaded guilty to those
charges and await sentencing. They were both also charged with
securities fraud in a civil complaint by securities regulators.
Eckstein, an accountant, settled those charges by agreeing not to
practice before the SEC for five years. He did not admit to or deny
the regulators' allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Messina is still contesting the regulators' civil charges.
``Ms. Messina was a vulnerable person and was victimized by an
exploitive management regime at Livent,'' said Barry A. Bohrer, her
lawyer. ``In fact, she helped solve a problem that others had
created.''
</P>
<P>
   Securities regulators also charged five other former Livent
employees with violating securities laws or with making profits by
trading in the company's stock with inside information. Two of
those employees have settled the charges by agreeing not to violate
federal securities laws.

U.S. POLLSTER FOR OPPONENT OF NETANYAHU IS BURGLARIZED
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A break-in at the Washington offices of an American
polling firm advising Ehud Barak, the leader of Israel's opposition
Labor Party, threatened to inject new venom into the election
campaign Wednesday, but the candidates exercised restraint while
awaiting results of an investigation by U.S. authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Although the aims of the burglars were not immediately clear,
there were strong suspicions that they were after material
concerning Barak's campaign to unseat Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in national elections on May 17.
</P>
<P>
   The overnight burglary occurred late Monday or early Tuesday at
the Capitol Hill offices of Stanley Greenberg, who has worked for
President Clinton and other Democratic politicians and now is a
consultant to Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Thieves removed a roof vent and tore through the ceiling of
Greenberg Quinlan Research Inc., Greenberg's company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain confidential records, materials, other items and petty
cash were taken,'' said Sgt. Joe Gentile, spokesman for the
Washington Metropolitan Police.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the possibility that the burglars had targeted
certain records,'' Gentile added. ``We advised the FBI, due to the
potential sensitive nature of the investigation. The FBI
volunteered to assist, and we took them up on the offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Tal Silberstein, Barak's campaign manager, said computerized
research material related to the Israeli election campaign had been
stolen. Whoever took it ``knew exactly what he was looking for,
because the only file pulled, according to what we understand at
the moment, is the file of the election campaign in Israel,''
Silberstein told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
   Aliza Goren, a spokeswoman for Barak, said in a separate radio
interview that the file contained ``material about election
campaign polls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot point to any guilty party,'' Ms. Goren added, ``and
we certainly don't have any assessment who did this. I really hope
very much that this is not related to the election campaign in
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak kept silent about the break-in, saying nothing about it in
a speech denouncing Netanyahu's policies at a Labor Party
convention Wednesday night. Netanyahu also ignored the incident in
a televised rebuttal of Barak's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   David Bar-Illan, a spokesman for Netanyahu, said that the prime
minister's office ``has no knowledge'' of who could have been
behind the break-in, and that ``we don't consider it a
possibility'' that political supporters of Netanyahu had been
involved.
</P>
<P>
   But some legislators from the Labor Party pointed a finger at
Netanyahu's Likud Party. ``I would like to hope that there was no
guiding hand or a long arm from Israel,'' said Micha Goldman, a
Labor lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Ronit Eckstein, a spokeswoman for the Likud retorted: ``God
forbid. We will not allow the Labor Party to exploit a criminal act
in the United States to sully our image here. We hope that the
guilty parties will be found quickly and prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg conducted campaign polls for Clinton in 1992 and has
also advised President Nelson Mandela of South Africa and Prime
Minister Tony Blair of Britain. He is advising Barak along with
another Democratic strategist, James Carville, and a third American
consultant, Robert Shrum.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, who recently accused Barak of using American advisers
to engage in ``character assassination,'' has his own American
consultant, Arthur Finkelstein, who has advised conservative
American politicians including former Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato of
New York.
</P>
<P>
   While the break-in caused only mild ripples Wednesday in the
Israeli campaign, it was headline news in the Israeli press. Yediot
Ahronot, a mass circulation daily, asked in its headline: ``An
Israeli Watergate?''

MARKETS PLUNGE, MONTHS AFTER $41.5B BAILOUT, AS BANK CHIEF QUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ This time, Brazil has only itself to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The economic bandage that had been delicately holding together
Latin America's largest economy ripped open Wednesday, amid news
that Brazil's central bank chief unexpectedly resigned and that the
country devalued its currency by nearly 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's volatility reminded many of the panic that swept
through Brazil in September, when markets dived and investors
pulled billions of dollars out of the country. At the time,
Brazilian officials blamed the reaction on uncertainty created by
crises in Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-November, a few weeks after President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso was overwhelmingly reelected to a second term, the
International Monetary Fund and other lenders approved a $41.5
billion loan package for Brazil. The lenders expressed confidence
that the administration could fix the economy by reducing its
budget deficit, which now hovers around 8 percent of gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the cause of the anxiety seems rooted in
Brazil's own economic and political problems. In addition to the
instability caused by the resignation of Brazil's top bank official
and the currency devaluation, Cardoso has been unable to get
crucial constitutional reforms through the congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil's problems probably usher in a new round of global
contagion,'' Merrill Lynch chief economist Bruce Steinberg told
Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of Latin America will now fall into recession, there
could be spillover effects into other emerging markets, and
questions have to be raised about US and European growth and
earnings prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sao Paulo, the Bovespa index, Latin America's largest stock
market, reacted to the news by plunging 10 percent at Wednesday's
opening bell. The frantic sell-off triggered an electronic
circuit-breaker that suspended trading for 30 minutes. The market
ended the day down 5.05 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other Latin American markets reacted with similar fear. The
Mexico City exchange fell 4.6 percent. The Buenos Aires market in
Argentina dropped 10.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since last summer, Brazil has lost more than $40 billion in
foreign capital and another $1.2 billion left on Tuesday. During
the same period, the country's reserves have dwindled to about $35
billion from more than $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The first shock Wednesday was Gustavo Franco's resignation. He
was immediately replaced by Francisco Lopes, another highly
regarded central banker, whose first action was to allow Brazil's
currency, the real, to trade at a more flexible rate against the US
dollar. The move amounted to a devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Although the devaluation was meant to calm anxious investors,
who believed the Brazilian currency was overvalued, many saw it as
a troubling sign that the country's nagging financial problems are
getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, an opposition governor, Itamar Franco of the eastern
industrial state of Minas Gerais, stopped payments on state loans,
and demanded that the Cardoso government refinance the state's $15
billion debt. Two other states have threatened to stop loan
payments. That has raised more concerns about political support for
Cardoso, who succeeded Franco as president, and about whether
Brazil will be able to keep its deficit-cutting commitments as part
of its agreement to the IMF package.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government will honor all its domestic and foreign
contracts,'' Cardoso asserted in a nationally televised speech
Wednesday from Brasilia, the nation's capital. ``Rules are made to
be followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Campos, a Sao Paulo-based economist, said that although
the Brazilian economy remains fairly strong, the Cardoso government
may be forced to take further action to avoid continued capital
flight and market losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take more than simply replacing the top person at the
central bank,'' said Campos. Cardoso ``will either have to force
the opposition to go along or be flexible enough to negotiate with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, which went through its own currency crisis in 1994
and has suffered recently from record-low oil prices, the impact of
Wednesday's events were felt immediately. Mexico's currency, the
peso, weakened so much against the dollar that the central bank
stepped in to protect it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico has more discipline in its economic and fiscal
structure that it seems Brazil is trying to achieve,'' one Mexican
central bank official said Wednesday on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't mean we don't feel instability,'' the
official said. ``Just that we have less reason to panic right
now.''

MINUS A TRUE CHALLENGE, JORDAN TAKES HIS FINAL BOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ He made it official and unequivocal. Again. Almost.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan retired from basketball for the second time
Wednesday, leaving the door open just a crack for a possible
return. This time the reasons for leaving had less to do with the
Bulls' new coach, the Bulls' old front office, the
lockout-abbreviated NBA season, or the gash on his right index
finger.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason? Michael Jordan can't be Michael Jordan, and
that is not good enough for Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, I'm fine,'' Jordan told the world at a news
conference at the United Center, where his No. 23 was re-retired.
``The desire to play is always going to be there. But I have to
have it every time I step on the court. I've always been sure about
that before. I'm unsure about that now. Physically, it would be
easy. Mentally, it would have been tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan titillated his legion of fans and admirers by refusing to
say ``never'' when asked if he would return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never say never,'' he said. ``But I'm 99.9 percent sure. I'm
very secure with my decision. Take it for what it's worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern said Jordan was finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get off it. He's not coming back,'' Stern said. ``It's time to
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the NBA and the Bulls will now have to do. Both
organizations are confident they can do so, despite losing the most
marketable player and remarkable ratings driver in league history.
Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who saw his string of sellouts and
titles end, said the occasion ``has to be the toughest day in the
history of the Chicago Bulls. It's tough for the city of Chicago,
the NBA, basketball fans around the world, and Michael Jordan fans
around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged Stern to order that No. 23 be retired by the league _
the same way baseball retired Jackie Robinson's No. 42 _ adding,
``We in Chicago think anyone who wears a basketball uniform with
No. 23 will be a pretender.'' Stern didn't bite. (The Celtics
already have retired the number in honor of Frank Ramsey.)
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf, Stern, Jordan, and Jordan's wife, Juanita, sat at the
podium for the announcement, which was huge news here in the City
of Broad Shoulders. Every television station with a minicam carried
it live, and it has been the lead story on every newscast for the
last two days, supplanting the weather that has turned Chicago into
Vladivostok. Camera crews from Japan were here, as well as
reporters from most major cities and as far away as Milan.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan hung around to answer a slew of questions, many of which
were inaudible because of a malfunctioning sound system. Juanita
Jordan was asked just one: What's going to happen to her life now?
</P>
<P>
   ``My life won't change at all,'' she said. ``I see Michael doing
more car-pooling. That's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was vague about when he actually decided to retire. He
said he felt that way last June after the NBA Finals but could not
make it definite. He said his involvement in the labor talks last
September was not a sign that he was interested in returning but
rather ``an obligation to the players of tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said he thought for a moment that Jordan's involvement in
the talks might mean another season for the alphaBull.
</P>
<P>
   ``It crossed my mind,'' the commish said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said not even the return of coach Phil Jackson might have
been enough to bring him back. He said he was worn out from last
season and not even the delayed start of this season was enough to
bring him back. He was lacking what he knew he needed: the drive,
the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love basketball, and it's hard to give up what you love,''
he said. ``I just don't have the mental challenge that Michael
Jordan needs. I don't want to fool myself knowing that I'm not
there 100 percent mentally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with Phil, I think I would have had a tough time finding
that challenge. He's usually good at finding them, but I don't know
if he would have been able to. I can't say he would be able to
restore that.''
</P>
<P>
   He also revealed that even if he were inclined to return, his
injured finger, which will require surgery in the next couple of
weeks, would have forced him to miss two months. He said he severed
a tendon in the finger while trying to cut a cigar. Honest.
</P>
<P>
   At his pre-retirement party Tuesday night at the Hudson Club in
Chicago, the manager cut his cigar.
</P>
<P>
   So what now? Ubiquitous agent David Falk noted that Jordan still
has many endorsements and those aren't going away. Jordan said he
wanted to spend more time with his family, although he said the
same thing in 1993 and then promptly went off to Florida to play
baseball. He has three children _ Jeffrey, 10; Marcus, 8; and
Jasmine, 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a parent is a challenge,'' he said. ``I look forward to
that . . . I want to get away from basketball a little bit and look
at it from afar.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about that one-10th of 1 percent? He's soon to turn 36
and the 1999-2000 season isn't that far off. Would he, for
instance, consider rejoining Jackson in New York as a member of the
Knicks?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty sure that's not going to happen,'' he said.
``Although I love New York. But I can't see myself coming out of
retirement to play in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said he would still live in Chicago, would still follow
the Bulls, and would be there to help them. That did not include
coaching _ Tim Floyd should get the official pronouncement as early
as Thursday _ but did not exclude ownership. He challenged them to
keep the bar high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they welcome that challenge, and that's good,'' he
said. ``We set a high standard here. The pressure is on them to
maintain it.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``The best way to survive Michael Jordan is to
learn to live without him. Life without Michael Jordan also has to
be without Michael Jordan. But I'll be around if they want my two
cents.''

 &HT;    Falcons defensive backfield hobbled
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the Falcons prepare to face the NFL's most prolific
passing offense, two defensive backs are beat up enough that their
status is uncertain for Sunday's NFC Championship Game against the
Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Starting cornerback Ronnie Bradford, who suffered a slight
shoulder separation Dec. 27 against Miami, dressed but did not play
Saturday against the 49ers when second-year cornerback Michael
Booker started.
</P>
<P>
   His role is increasing in practice, but Booker _ who started six
games in the regular season when Bradford had a strained knee
ligament _ remains the starter.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Devin Bush, who backs up both safety spots and is the
team's nickel and dime safety, did not practice Wednesday. He has a
strained hamstring and is listed as ``doubtful'' on the team's
injury report.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota led the NFL in passing offense, averaging 270.5
passing yards per game, while scoring 41 passing touchdowns.
Atlanta was No. 21 in the NFL in pass defense, allowing an average
of 220.7 passing yards per game, and 22 passing touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford played safety early in his six-year career with the
Broncos and Cardinals. Before Bush returned from a knee injury
suffered in the preseason, Bradford would move from corner to
safety in passing situations, replacing starting strong safety
William White.
</P>
<P>
   White is practicing as the nickel and dime safety, but Bradford
is expected to play Sunday and could see action at several spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt (Bradford will start at corner) because he won't take
all those reps in practice,'' defensive coordinator Rich Brooks
said. ``He might work in the nickel (corner spot, with Randy
Fuller). He'll work at both nickel and (regular) safety (spots)
this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford's shoulder was heavily taped in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever they ask me to do, I'll do,'' he said. ``I'm ready to
go. At this point, (the shoulder) doesn't bother me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had 21 tackles, two fumbles forced, one recovered and 10 of
his 13 career pass defenses in just 12 games. ``I'll test it out
(today), and try to practice,'' he said. ``When I pick up speed ...
it grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-2, 203-pound Booker would match up better size-wise
with Minnesota's 6-4, 211-pound rookie receiver Randy Moss than the
5-10, 188-pound Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   But while Booker's play improved dramatically this season, his
chief weakness is still considered coverage on deep balls _ Moss'
specialty.
</P>
<P>
   In 14 games and six starts, Booker had 45 tackles, one
interception and 11 pass defenses. Bradford, in 14 games and 10
starts, had 40 tackles, three interceptions (one returned for a
touchdown) and 11 pass defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Bowl cornerback Ray Buchanan is the Falcons' fastest
defensive back, but will not lock up exclusively on the speedy
Moss, in part because of his size. Buchanan is 5-9, 198 pounds.

 &HT;    IOC tells sponsors scandal in hand
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now that the International Olympic Committee has
completed its bribery probe, it will ``clean house'' and revamp its
host city selection process, an IOC executive said Wednesday in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   IOC marketing director Michael Payne, in town to shore up
support from big-money sponsors, said the committee has gathered
enough evidence to seek the expulsion of members who engaged in
unethical behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC is committed to root out any form of unethical and
inappropriate behavior, and we will do this decisively and
quickly,'' Payne said in an interview after huddling with
executives at Coca-Cola and United Parcel Service and speaking by
phone with officers at The Home Depot, a U.S. Olympic Committee
sponsor. He was heading today to Salt Lake City, the focal point of
four major investigations into allegations of bribery of IOC
officials to snare the 2002 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident that they are going to do what they said they
would do _ take swift and decisive action,'' Coca-Cola spokesman
Ben Deutsch said.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC will publish on Jan. 24 a report identifying the members
implicated in its investigation after a meeting of the
organization's executive board in Lausanne, Switzerland. The report
also will recommend changes in the selection process for host
cities, Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report will recommend that a number of members be
suspended, if they don't resign,'' he said. The IOC sent letters
this week to members implicated in the investigation, demanding an
explanation of their actions. The full IOC, at its annual meeting
slated in June, would have to agree to any expulsions.
</P>
<P>
   Between eight and a dozen members, primarily from African and
Latin American countries, will be asked to resign, according to
various news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Other investigations are under way by the U.S. Olympic
Committee, the U.S. Justice Department and the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee's internal ethics committee.
</P>
<P>
   The SLOC has had its bloodletting. President Frank Joklik and
senior vice president Dave Johnson stepped down last week,
marketing and legal affairs vice president Kelly Flint and
licensing director Rod Hamson were placed on paid leave, and former
president Tom Welch lost his $10,000-a-month consulting fee.
</P>
<P>
   The president of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., one of
a dozen worldwide corporate Olympic sponsors, urged the IOC to
extend its investigation of irregular bidding practices beyond Salt
Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they fail to do that and something else comes up, the rings
won't be tarnished, they'll be broken,'' David D'Alessandro told
the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro, a frequent critic of the Atlanta Games, urged the
IOC to expand its investigation to include the winning bid efforts
of Atlanta and Nagano as well as the upcoming Summer Games in
Sydney and Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Payne said the IOC investigation is complete but added the
organization wouldn't close the door on any additional
substantiated allegations. ``The IOC's commitment is to seek out
any form of inappropriate behavior that went on in Salt Lake City
and to the extent necessary to get evidence anywhere else,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Australia IOC member Kevan Gosper said Wednesday the
organization will examine claims by a senior member of Sydney's bid
team that he was approached by one IOC member and an intermediary
to offer bribes. Gosper said he spoke to Bruce Baird, a former New
South Wales state Olympics minister, about the claims.
</P>
<P>
   Payne said he would meet with the worldwide Olympic sponsors,
companies that commit at least $40 million to sponsor Winter and
Summer Games in a four-year cycle. ``Rule No. 1 is keep your
partners fully informed,'' said Payne, whose committee will spend
$150 million on image-polishing ads on the 2000 Games, a project
involving Meridian Management of Atlanta. That effort was in the
works before the scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
   Only three corporations say they have renewed their sponsorships
for Salt Lake City and Athens: t Coca-Cola, Time/Sports Illustrated
and Sema, the technology company that replaced IBM as a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based UPS is uncertain whether to extend its Olympic
sponsorship past the 2000 Games in Sydney. Spokeswoman Susan
Rosenberg said UPS will decide this year.
</P>
<P>
   UPS executives were reassured by Payne that the IOC was taking
swift and appropriate action. ``We are very positive about the
Games and what they can do for UPS as far as our programs and
marketing initiatives,'' Rosenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I think it is going to come out better. It has forced
everybody to go back in and do some analysis and close scrutiny.
For better or worse, it may be held up to higher standards, and now
they are going to enforce and clarify what those standards are,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Payne also put a positive spin on the situation. He noted that
allegations of bribery were nothing new, but no one had ever been
willing to produce evidence. ``This has allowed us to address
unequivocally some of the rumors that have been around for some
time and be able to weed out any unacceptable and unethical
behavior,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake organizers still need to raise $245 million of the
$859 million in sponsorship cash and services that form the bulk of
its $1.45 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   One corporate sponsor, US West, has said it will hold up a $5
million sponsorship payment due at the end of this month until the
mess is cleared up.
</P>
<P>
   Payne said he's not concerned about Salt Lake's ability to go
ahead with the 2002 Winter Games. ``The IOC, USOC and SLOC have
already raised more money than any previous Olympic Games
committees,'' he said. ``The issue of putting the Games on in Salt
Lake is not at risk. Whether the budgets need to be amended and
they need to come back on some capital, maybe. But the core of what
is needed is more than enough.''

 &HT;    Another Petty gets behind the wheel
 &HT;    By Al Levine and Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE _ The face of NASCAR got a bit younger Wednesday. In
fact, this face looks as if it doesn't shave yet. Adam Petty, 18,
was introduced as a new driver on the Busch Grand National division
during the Charlotte Motor Speedway media tour.
</P>
<P>
   Adam is the son of Winston Cup driver Kyle Petty, the grandson
of the legendary Richard Petty and great-grandson of Lee Petty,
who, to put it in Pettyspeak, ``started this whole deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Petty will drive the No. 45 Chevrolet Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're the first fourth-generation family to be
competing in any sport,'' Richard Petty said. ``That won't get us
into the Guinness Book of Records, but if Adam's successful maybe
it will.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year was Adam's first as a professional driver. Two weeks
after graduating high school, he won his first pole in an ASA race.
Five races later, on June 27, two weeks before his 18th birthday,
he became the youngest driver to win an ASA race, at the I-70
Speedway in Odessa, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   At 18 years and 3 months, he became the youngest ARCA
superspeedway winner, surpassing his father, at Charlotte Motor
Speedway. Kyle was 18 years and 8 months when he won his first ARCA
start, at Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   The grandfather said he would have preferred that Adam have
another year of driving experience before moving to Busch. ``I
think he's more focused than Kyle was when he first started out,''
Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's main sponsor is Spree prepaid telephone cards.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of youth
</P>
<P>
   As if Adam Petty should worry about the next generation of
stock-car drivers, there was even-younger Charles Shoemaker lurking
just outside Petty's garage area news conference with his '34 Ford
Sedan Legend Car.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker is a 15-year-old from McDonough who apparently skipped
classes at Henry County High to pose for photos next to his car. He
was there on behalf of Speedway Children's Charities. Racing as a
Semi-Pro, Shoemaker will donate his winnings from Legends races at
Atlanta Motor Speedway and Charlotte to the Children's Charities in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   A sophomore honor student at Henry County, he has won
championships in quarter-midgets and will compete in his first Late
Model race at Lanier Speedway in May.
</P>
<P>
   It's not chicken feed
</P>
<P>
   For 10 years, poultry-farmer Dale Earnhardt has sold chickens to
Perdue. ``I made a little bit of money in the chicken business with
Perdue,'' he said. ``Finally, these guys wised up.'' Which means
that Perdue chicken will be one of Earnhardt's sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt said a recent inventory of his poultry operation
revealed more than five million eggs in the henhouse.

LUCENT TO ACQUIRE ASCEND FOR $19.6B 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The telecommunications industry took another giant step toward
consolidation Wednesday as Lucent Technologies Inc. agreed to
acquire Ascend Communications Inc. in a stock deal valued at $19.6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The widely expected deal continues the pairings of major voice
and data equipment suppliers as fast-moving technologies blur
distinctions between telephone, cable, and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation's largest and oldest supplier of telephone
switching equipment, Lucent gets three important things in its
purchase of Ascend: the number two provider of advanced equipment
that carries Internet traffic; access to overseas telephone
markets; and the opportunity to become a major player in the
convergence of data, voice, and video communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   For Lucent, which was spun out of AT&AMP;T Corp. in 1996, the Ascend
deal is the company's second this week, and the largest of its 18
acquisitions. On Monday, Lucent announced the purchase of Kenan
Systems Inc., a 16-year-old Cambridge, Mass. software developer,
for $1.45 billion in Lucent stock.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Lucent, headquartered in Murray Hill, N.J.,
and Ascend, of Alameda, Calif., is expected to provide formidable
competition to Cisco Systems Inc. of San Jose, Calif., the leading
data networking company. A third major player is Canadian-based
Northern Telecom, a longtime Lucent rival that has followed a
similar acquisition strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is already a textbook merger success story,'' said
Richard McGinn, Lucent's chairman and chief executive, adding that
he expects the transaction to close in May, following shareholder
approval by both companies.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lucent and Ascend have a strong presence in Massachusetts _
each company owns firms here _ and some analysts believe it was
Ascend's acquisition of Cascade Communications Inc. of Westford in
1997 that set into motion the deal announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What drove this merger was Cascade Communications, perhaps the
best move Ascend ever made,'' said Timothy P. Savageaux,
telecommunications research analyst at Volpe Brown &AMP; Whelan in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Cascade pioneered the commercialization of a line of high-speed
networking switches that are now widely used to carry Internet
traffic. With 810 people in Westford and Boxborough, plus 300
employees from its acquisition of Stratus Computer Corp. in
Marlborough, Ascend employs more people in Massachusetts than it
does in California.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, which employs more than 140,000 worldwide, has become a
major employer in Massachusetts, with more than 7,000 workers. Most
are based in Andover at the Merrimack Valley Works, which builds
voice telephone equipment. In recent years, Lucent has also
acquired a trio of small Bay State companies and consolidated their
operations in Concord.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lucent-Ascend deal proves once again that you can build
world-class companies in Massachusetts that are second to none,''
said Desh Despande, cofounder of Cascade, who left Ascend to start
another company, Sycamore Networks of Tewksbury. He also said the
deal made sense for both Lucent and Ascend, each providing
strengths the other lacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucent still has an oldtime flavor where engineers take a long
time to do things that are rugged and reliable, while Ascend
provides agility and speed where its engineers can more quickly
adapt the latest technology. That combination of nimbleness and
rugged reliability is what telecommunications carriers companies
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucent's McGinn said the company will continue to look for more
acquisitions to expand its product lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to invest heavily to grow this businss faster
than the marketplace,'' McGinn said, adding there will be some
minor layoffs at headquarters, where there is job overlap.
</P>
<P>
   Buying smaller companies has not always worked for Lucent, and
the Ascend deal is expected to help correct some of those more
problematic acquisitions, said Maribel Lopez, telecommunications
analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed to several companies, including Livingston
Enterprises of Pleasanton, Calif., a developer of remote-access
equipment that was acquired for $610 million in Lucent stock that
ran into product development and sales problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucent had a string-of-pearls acquisition strategy and the
products that some of these data networking companies developed
were just not delivering what Lucent expected and needed to compete
against Cisco,'' said Lopez. She added that Lucent's biggest
challenge will be ``getting out of Ascend's way and let them do
their thing in data networking.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Ascend's president and chief executive,
Mory Ejabat, will stay on for six to 12 months and then leave the
company. Ascend shareholders will receive 0.825 shares of Lucent
stock for every Ascend share. Based on 228 million Ascend shares
and options and Lucent's closing price of 104 1/4, the all-stock
transaction values Ascend shares at $86 each, and the total deal at
$19.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend stock hit a 52-week high of 80 5/16 Wednesday, up 5 3/8,
as more than 34.8 million shares were traded _ five times its usual
volume. Rumors that both sides were negotiating and some
skittishness by investors prompted Lucent stock to tumble from 117
3/16 last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may seem like a pricey deal, but it is really a fair one
for both companies,'' said Savageaux. ``It will provide positive
earnings for Lucent, which gets into the data part of the carrier
market, and Ascend gets a very strong partner.''

 &HT;    Nicklaus surgery to replace ailing hip
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After months of delaying what seemed medically
inevitable, Jack Nicklaus said Wednesday that he will undergo hip
replacement surgery later this month.
</P>
<P>
   While the operation on Nicklaus' severely arthritic hip should
enhance his future golf, it also brings a short-term penalty.
Nicklaus, who turns 59 on Jan. 21, likely will see his streak of 40
straight Masters end in April while he's recuperating.
</P>
<P>
   Without the surgery, however, Nicklaus' goal of playing all four
majors in the year 2000 _ or for that matter, playing without pain
at any level _ would have been unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I feel strong enough and able to play golf at a
competitive level, I will continue to play tournament golf,'' said
the winner of 18 professional majors. ``If I want to play later
this year and in the future, now is the time for surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   A six-time Masters champion, Nicklaus finished sixth at Augusta
last year but has hardly played competitively since. Nicklaus'
streak of 154 majors for which he was eligible ended with a
withdrawal from last July's British Open field.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus had been attempting to strengthen the hip in recent
months, but he could only manage minimal stability with bone
rubbing against bone in the deteriorated socket.

STUDY TAKES ANOTHER LOOK AT MCAS TEST SCORES  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Nearly a decade after a controversial takeover by
Boston University, the Chelsea schools are the state's fourth most
effective, according to an analysis of MCAS test scores released
Thursday that measures how well a school performed when family
income and other demographic factors were considered.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard, North Reading, and Stoneham were the state's three most
effective districts, according to the analysis of the Massachusetts
Comprehensive Assessment System test conducted by a senior
reseacher at the Donahue Institute, a public policy think tank at
the University of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting that Chelsea's students, who scored poorly
on the MCAS test, are succeeding. But by analyzing the MCAS scores
of the state's 210,000 fourth-, eighth-, and 10th-graders who took
the test last May, researcher Robert Gaudet found that children in
Chelsea, as well as Shrewsbury, Woburn, and Brookline, outperformed
statistical predictions based on social and economic factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a very complicated demography,'' said Douglas
Sears, the Chelsea school superintendent. ``We are always running
hard and fast to keep up.'' Eighty percent of Chelsea students are
poor enough to qualify for free school lunch and two-thirds do not
speak English at home.
</P>
<P>
   Sears said that he had focused on having schools use days more
efficiently, even eliminating ``distractions'' like some field
trips, and has placed a premium on reading.
</P>
<P>
   Still, six years and more than $3 billion into Massachusetts'
education reform, Gaudet found that demographic factors, such as
family income, parent education, and percentage of single-parent
households, significantly overshadow the schools' efforts when it
comes to student success or failure.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gaudet said his analysis shows that demographic
differences among the state's 200 largest school districts explain
86 percent of the variation in test scores. All of the work school
districts do _ offering extra reading classes, or increasing
teacher training, or mandating longer school days _ accounts for
only 14 percent of the difference.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason places such as Weston and Wellesley, with
relatively high MCAS scores, do not make the state's top 50 most
effective districts, said Gaudet, a founder and former principal of
the Renaissance charter school in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Weston is statistically the state's most affluent community and
a top test-scorer; achievement there is about as it should be given
the town's demographics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are not playing a significant role in increasing
academic performance as measured by MCAS,'' Gaudet said in a recent
interview. ``Districts that break that cycle are the ones we need
to study.''
</P>
<P>
   Woburn is one such place. Eighth overall in effectiveness based
on Gaudet's MCAS analysis, Woburn's 1998 Iowa reading test scores
placed it in the top 5 percent statewide. Yet 17 percent of its
students qualify for free school lunch, and fewer than 1 percent
have classroom Internet access, compared to 40 percent statewide.
</P>
<P>
   On the MCAS test, given its demographics, Woburn was second most
effective in fourth-grade reading, and ninth most effective in
eighth-grade reading. Officials there said their district was
faster to implement the changes put in motion by the Education
Reform Act of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years ago, one of our overarching goals was to align our
curriculum'' with the state standards ``and gear up staff
development,'' said Woburn School Superintendent Carl Batchelder.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with leaders in ``effective'' districts, Gaudet
noted a pattern: Strong leadership, regular use of data to improve
teaching practices, a strong focus on literacy, and vigorously
aligning teaching to state standards in each subject, known as
curriculum frameworks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the surprises in Gaudet's analysis is the variation in
MCAS scores among 34 similar school districts he calls ``middle
Massachusetts.'' They are the state's demographically average
districts, yet their scores varied wildly.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneham and Watertown, for example, are demographically
similar. But Stoneham's combined MCAS score of fourth-, eighth-,
and 10th-grade students averaged 2,133 points compared to
Watertown's 2,063 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't tell districts to change demographically. What you
can do is point to systems similar to them that have overcome their
demography,'' said Lou DiNatale, a senior fellow at UMass's
McCormack Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The six demographic indicators Gaudet used were income, poverty
rate, parent education level, percent of children in single-parent
households, percent of children in private schools, and percent of
non-English speakers. They were then linked statistically to
overall scores on the MCAS. Last fall, he did the same analysis
using the 1996 Massachusetts Educational Assessment Program (MEAP)
and Iowa tests.
</P>
<P>
   Gaudet said he hopes his formula for measuring school
effectiveness will shine a light on unexpectedly high-performing
systems like Woburn and others that educators have not normally
turned to when seeking out what works.

 &HT;    Duval's current domination falls short of the best
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Eight hits in 27 at-bats? Batting .296 is common in
baseball, but except for a handful of instances, it is virtually
unheard of in professional golf.
</P>
<P>
   What David Duval has accomplished since the fall of 1997, when
he closed with three wins in a row, through Sunday's win at the
Mercedes Championships, is the kind of stuff few players in history
have managed even to approach. Duval's nine-shot victory at Kapalua
_ on 29 birdies _ gave him eight wins in 27 tournaments and more
than $4.3 million earned in less than 18 months. If Duval is not
atop golf's official world rankings when the figures, currently
putting Tiger Woods at No. 1, are updated, then maybe it's time for
golf's computer poo-bahs to check their respective motherboards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as dominating as Duval has been, nearly matching Nick
Price's nine wins in 27 starts in 1993-94, he can't touch the
greatest runs in golf history. In 1974-75, Johnny Miller won 11
times in 24 starts. Arnold Palmer (1962-63) and Tom Watson
(1979-80) won 10 times in 27 starts. Jack Nicklaus won 10 of 27 in
1971-73, then ran it to 12 of 30. Before the modern golf era, of
course, Byron Nelson won 11 tournaments in a row in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for those 20 players from Kapalua playing this week
in Hawaii's Sony Open, the season's first full-field event, Duval
is taking the week off to go skiing in Sun Valley, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't do that as well as I play golf,'' the former
Georgia Tech player said, ``but I'm getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday special
</P>
<P>
   So what is a PGA Tour player to do when he misses a Friday cut?
In some cases this year, tee it up on Saturday, anyway. The ``Bobby
Jones Saturday Series,'' founded by Gary Hallberg in cooperation
with the family of the late Bobby Jones, will be played during 29
PGA Tour events, matching 22 pros with four-man amateur teams. The
fee is $2,000 per person, with a significant portion going to

   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Brazil's surprise devaluation was anything but surprising.
</P>
<P>
   That is not Monday morning quarterbacking. Devaluation has been
the prediction of many economists even after the International
Monetary Fund, backed by the Clinton administration, provided a $40
billion credit line several months ago that Brazil was to use to
defend the value of its currency as well as help it plug a huge
hole in its federal deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the IMF bailout, independent economists argued
repeatedly, was that it allowed Brazil to cling to an overvalued
exchange rate _ by some estimates, 30 percent above sustainable
levels. At the same time, its policy became increasingly dependent
on short-term loans. That combination _ overvalued currency and
huge short-term loans _ said Jeffrey Sachs of the Harvard Institute
for International Development, ``is anywhere and everywhere an
invitation for financial chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that Brazil has devalued, what happens next? One
possibility is that limited devaluation works. Investors may decide
that the currency will remain stable hereafter and that Brazil will
stick close to its commitments to close its budget deficit. If that
happens, domestic interest rates could fall and Brazil could begin
to recover.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, limited devaluation will need to be backed by stiff
interest rate increases to persuade lenders to stay put. Indeed,
the new president of the central bank seemed to anticipate that
possibility Wednesday when he vowed to use Brazil's billions of
dollars in reserves to intervene in the markets. He also suggested
he might ``raise interest rates to defend our foreign exchange
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, the economy could go into a tailspin. The
immediate victims would, of course, be Brazilian workers and their
families. But nearby trading partners, especially Argentina, would
be hit hard as they lose Brazil's large export market.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with an overvalued currency is that it makes imports
cheap and exports dear, leading to a drain on the country's dollar
reserves. At some point lenders grow fearful that the country will
run out of dollars. They cash in their loans before someone else
lays claim to the dwindling dollars, forcing the country to
squander the rest of its reserves defending its exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   Countries can postpone the inevitable by jacking up interest
rates to sky-high levels _ over 30 percent in Brazil's case _ to
attract new loans. But high interest rates throw the economy into
recession, sapping political support. Eventually, the country
chooses to stop defending the currency, which, after the dust
settles on foreign exchange markets, can allow it to cut its
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   An overvalued currency and large short-term debt buried the
Mexican currency in 1995, the currencies of Thailand, Indonesia,
Korea and Russia last year. Now comes Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Misaligned currencies cannot be defended by high interest
rates,'' Rudiger Dornbusch, a leading international economist at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Wednesday. He said
the same thing in October.
</P>
<P>
   The devaluation was predictable, Sachs said Wednesday, echoing
statements he made in October. ``Falsely pegged currencies _
currency pegs that lack political and economic commitment _ cannot
last,'' Gary Hufbauer of the Institute for International Economics
said Wednesday. He made the same prediction last year.
</P>
<P>
   So if economists could see disaster coming, why couldn't Brazil?
In part, its obstinacy can be traced to President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, who as Finance Minister gained credit earlier in the
decade stamping out Brazil's hyperinflation by tying its currency
rigidly to the dollar. In effect, Cardoso solved Brazil's inflation
problem by turning control of its money supply over to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But his monetary crackdown produced a sharp recession, which
Cardoso has no stomach for repeating. For him, severing his
currency's tie to the dollar invites a return to an undisciplined
past. Sachs suggests that the pegged rate was a terrific way to
handle a financial emergency, but Cardoso stuck with the rigid
policy way too long.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Buttressing Cardoso's recent resolve was pressure from the
international financial community to take a hard stand against
devaluation. The wave of devaluations that started in Asia last
year spread quickly to Russia and threatened Latin America. Brazil
emerged as the place where monetary authorities vowed to stanch the
contagion.
</P>
<P>
   But the IMF-backed package was never credible, economists say.
Had it been fully adopted, it would have crushed the economy. For
that reason it was never embraced by Brazil's politicians. The
Parliament rejected some of the budget cutbacks. This week one of
the state governments defaulted on its debt. Both events eroded
investor confidence, driving some to flee. One day earlier this
week, Brazil lost close to a billion dollars of reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Something had to give. Wednesday, Brazil undertook a limited
devaluation of about 8 percent. The idea was to ease investors'
fears of a larger devaluation, thereby taking some pressure off its
currency. The fallout in Brazil and around the world depends
heavily on what policy options are followed.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty with Brazil's current plan is that limited
devaluation may not hold even if bolstered with large interest rate
rises. Mexico tried the policy in 1994, but investors fled and
forced the country within a few days to let its currency float
free.
</P>
<P>
   If, as many economists predict, Brazil follows Mexico's lead,
the economic fallout is hard to predict. For starters, Brazil has
incurred large dollar denominated debt. A devaluation raises the
cost of debt repayment, putting additional pressure on an already
bloated fiscal deficit. ``Devaluation could do Brazil more harm
than good,'' Dornbusch says. And there is the additional risk that
devaluation in Brazil will scare investors throughout Latin America
and beyond, leading to successive rounds of devaluation and
economic free fall in Colombia, Hong Kong, even China. Jittery
investors might even exit the American stock market that many
believe is overpriced.
</P>
<P>
   But what can the IMF and the United States do? Prof. Richard
Cooper of Harvard suggests that this question _ the obvious one to
policy makers in Washington _ is the wrong question. He says that
Brazil's problems are overwhelmingly domestic _ its fiscal deficit
is ominously large _ and that problems with its exchange rate are
secondary. Last year's IMF-backed package is about all the
international world can do. The rest is up to the Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs thinks the correct answer is for Brazil to float the
currency. Freed from the need to defend its currency, Brazil's
crushing interest rates could return to normal. He would use money
from the IMF, along with credit from international banks, to smooth
the transition, reassuring investors that there will be no default
and the currency would be worth holding.
</P>
<P>
   Dornbusch says the answer to Brazil's problems, as well as those
of many emerging economies, is a currency board. A limited
devaluation would maintain the same policy that has produced
stagnant per capita income for two decades. A floating currency is
no answer because of the problem of dollar-denominated loans. But a
currency board, like that adopted by Argentina, would tie the value
of Brazil's currency to the dollar, but in a way that largely
removes the option of devaluation. That is the best guarantee that
the dollar link is permanent. The hope is that confident investors
will flock to Brazil, push down its interest rates and jump-start
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Economists agree on one issue: More than ever, help from the IMF
is crucial. Devaluation raises the cost of imports and could spook
investors. Fiscal cuts will depress economic activity. For all
these reasons, Brazil could use an injection of cash, assuming it
adopts prudent monetary and budget policies.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs adds that Brazil is the latest in a series of countries
whose economies collapsed under IMF programs. ``After matters
settle down,'' he said, ``we need to take a serious look at
fundamentally changing that institution.''

GILLETTE, BANKBOSTON PREDICT NO IMMEDIATE NEGATIVE EFFECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Brazil's currency devaluation led two local companies
with substantial business interests there to issue statements
Wednesday about the impact the fall of the real would have on them.
</P>
<P>
   As the US stock market dipped and Washington scrambled to deal
with the fallout, Gillette Co. and BankBoston Corp. said separately
they were closely monitoring the situation in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Neither said the crisis would likely have an immediate negative
effect on them, and BankBoston said ``market turbulence'' might be
something it could take advantage of.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston has assets of $73.8 billion, with about $6 billion of
that coming from Brazil. In a country with a volatile economy,
BankBoston has made money before when Brazil was in a downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are obviously monitoring events in Brazil very closely,''
BankBoston said in a statement. ``We have a very focused and
well-positioned business that has performed well over the 50 years
we've operated in Brazil, and it is prepared to take advantage of
market turbulence. We remain confident in our near-term performance
in Brazil, and our outlook for the remainder of the year continues
to be positive.''
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of BankBoston rose 9/16
to close at 38 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette, the Boston maker of razors, toiletries, and batteries,
does not break out sales by individual countries.
</P>
<P>
   But Gillette did say Latin America accounted for about 12
percent of 1997 sales of $10.06 billion and that Brazil is a major
Latin American customer.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate impact of Brazil's devaluation on Gillette is
``minimal,'' said Eric A. Kraus, director of corporate public
relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we locally manufacture most of what we sell in Brazil,
we will be able to offset some of the negative effect of the
devaluation through lower manufacturing costs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gillette raised prices for the products it sells in
Brazil at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The percentage increase is approximately equal to the just
announced movement of the Brazilian real trading band to the US
dollar,'' Kraus said.
</P>
<P>
   Problems in foreign markets were one reason why Gillette turned
in a rare subpar performance when it reported third-quarter
earnings last year.
</P>
<P>
   On the Big Board, shares of Gillette dropped 2 3/4 to close at
52 1/4.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For women with a high risk of breast cancer, a study being
published Thursday offers hope, but at a cruel price. Removing both
breasts while they are still healthy reduces the risk of getting
breast cancer by 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings, from a study of 639 women who had their
breasts removed from 1960 to 1993, are widely regarded as the most
reliable information to date on the long-term effectiveness of the
operation. Surgeons had been performing the procedure, known as
bilateral prophylactic mastectomy on such women, since the 1960s,
assuming it would reduce a woman's cancer risk. But they did not
know whether it really did, or by how much.
</P>
<P>
   One way high-risk women can try to protect themselves is by
having regular mammograms and breast examinations in hopes of
detecting the disease early enough to cure it with surgery,
chemotherapy and radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The only other way such women can protect themselves against
breast cancer is by taking the drug tamoxifen, which in a large
study last year was shown to reduce the risk of the disease by
about 45 percent. But women are supposed to take the drug for only
five years because it is thought to be ineffective after that time.
In addition, tamoxifen may cause blood clots or uterine cancer in
some women, and although it reduces the risk of breast cancer,
studies have not shown that it lowers the death rate from the
disease, as mastectomy does.
</P>
<P>
   The new study of the surgery, by researchers at the Mayo Clinic
in Rochester, Minn., is being published Thursday in the New England
Journal of Medicine. The women in the study were considered at high
risk because of a strong family history of breast cancer or a
personal history of breast lumps needing biopsies.
</P>
<P>
   Tests developed in the 1990s to detect genetic mutations also
provide an indication of women who may be at risk.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is a very important paper,'' said Dr. Patrick Borgen,
chief of breast surgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
in New York, who was not involved in the study. ``It's the first
credible calculation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Borgen and other cancer experts, including the authors of
the paper, cautioned that the findings should not be used to
pressure women into having their breasts removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study doesn't mean we should sell the surgery to more
women,'' Borgen said. ``But women who are considering it now have a
hard-core fact to use as they're making their calculation.''
</P>
<P>
   The data reflect rates of illness and death for the participants
as a group. Individual women involved in the study, and others who
have undergone the procedure, have no way of knowing whether it
spared them from cancer that might have killed them, or cost them
their breasts to protect them from a disease they would never have
contracted.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lynn Hartmann, a medical oncologist who directed the study
of breast removal, said, ``This report is not meant as a universal
recommendation for this procedure. It's meant to provide data for a
tough and controversial area. I think that to date only a minority
of high-risk women are interested in this procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patricia Ganz, director of the division for cancer
prevention and control research at the Jonsson Cancer Center at the
University of California at Los Angeles, said that despite the
warnings, ``a lot of physicians and surgeons scare women, and there
is fear in the medical community that they will say to women, `You
ought to have your breasts removed.'''
</P>
<P>
   Among the 639 women studied, the researchers concluded that at
least 20 and as many as 40 women would have died if they had not
had their breasts removed. But there were only 2 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barbara Weber, an expert on breast cancer genetics at the
University of Pennsylvania, and coauthor of an editorial that
accompanied the study, pointed out that although the procedure
theoretically saved 18 lives, 621 other women who had their breasts
removed probably would have survived without the drastic operation.
She also noted the paradox of finding evidence supporting breast
removal in healthy women, when treatments for women who already
have cancer are aimed at saving the breast whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, she and other researchers said, many women with
strong family histories of breast and ovarian cancer are urged to
have their ovaries removed. But that surgery is not disfiguring,
and ovarian cancer, unlike breast cancer, is difficult to detect
early enough to save a woman's life.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Larry Norton, director of the Lauder Breast Center at
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said the study was
convincing and important. But the surgery ``is not for everybody,''
Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like very much to make this not an option, to have
better ways of preventing breast cancer in ways that do not involve
surgery,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   Norton said he hoped studies that would be starting soon,
combining a tamoxifen-like drug and other drugs that manipulate
hormone levels, would provide a risk reduction equal to that shown
for the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The number of women in the United States who have had their
breasts removed in hopes of preventing cancer is not known. There
is no registry of cases. Dr. Hartmann and other researchers said
that women who wanted it tended to be those who had seen mothers,
aunts and sisters die young from breast cancer.

UNDATED: breast cancer. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Borgen said there had been a recent increase in interest in the
surgery, but he did not think the number of procedures had risen
with the development during the 1990s of tests for mutations in the
genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, which greatly increase a woman's risk of
developing breast or ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we had a way to identify women who had an 85 percent
chance of developing breast cancer, women said, `What can you tell
me about prophylactic mastectomy?''' Borgen said. ``All we could
say was, `Gee, we think it works. But no studies have been done.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although it might seem reasonable to assume that a woman without
a breasts cannot get breast cancer, proof was needed. Mastectomy
can remove only 90 percent to 95 percent of breast tissue, and many
researchers feared that the tissue left behind might harbor rogue
cells that could one day turn malignant.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hartmann and her colleagues sought to fill the information
gap by conducting a retrospective study, involving women who had
had the surgery in the past, rather than women going through it
now. They used the Mayo Clinic's records to identify 639 women who
had prophylactic mastectomies there from 1960 to 1993. The women
were 18 to 79 years old when they had the surgery, with a median
age of 42 years. Half the women had had the surgery 14 or more
years before, and all had had it at least five years previously.
</P>
<P>
   The team classified 214 of the women as high risk because their
family histories, Dr. Hartmann said. Many had mothers or sisters,
or both, with the disease, and in 150 of their families, there were
three or more breast cancers among close relatives. The women were
not tested for mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, but Dr. Hartmann
said the tests are under way.
</P>
<P>
   High-risk families like the ones identified in the study account
for 5 percent to 10 percent of the 180,000 new cases of breast
cancer diagnosed each year, Dr. Hartmann estimated.
</P>
<P>
   The other 425 study subjects, even though they had their breasts
removed, were considered to have been at only moderate risk. They
had fewer close relatives with the disease than the high-risk women
did, but, Dr. Hartmann said, many had chosen the surgery because of
their own histories of multiple breast lumps that required repeated
biopsies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one is an exercise in anxiety control,'' Dr. Hartmann
said. She said some women with that kind of history reach a point
where they look ahead and see an endless series of painful,
nerve-wracking biopsies, one of which they imagine will finally
give the result they have been dreading all along. And they decide
they might as well get it over with.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers tried to determine how many breast cancers would
have developed and how many women would have died if the surgery
had not been performed. Then they compared the expected numbers to
the real ones.
</P>
<P>
   They did the calculations differently for the two groups of
women. For the 214 at high risk, they compared the women with their
own sisters, who had not undergone the preventive surgery. Since
siblings are similar genetically and usually share the same
environment growing up, they assumed the sisters' risk of breast
cancer would be similar.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of the breast cancers that developed in the
untreated sisters after the subjects had mastectomies, the
researchers calculated that 38 would have been expected in the
subjects. But only three occurred _ a reduction in risk of more
than 90 percent. Similarly, 10 deaths from breast cancer would have
been expected, but only 2 occurred _ an 80 percent risk reduction.
</P>
<P>
   A computer model predicted 37.4 cases of breast cancer among
women in the moderate group, and only four occurred, for a 90
percent reduction in risk. Ten deaths were expected and none
occurred _ a 100 percent risk reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The Mayo Clinic did not disclose the names of women who
participated in the study. But a woman who had the surgery
elsewhere agreed to be interviewed. Staci Mishkin, 40, from
Springfield, Va., was delighted to hear of the study, which, she
said, ``validates what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Ms. Mishkin had both breasts removed. She was
perfectly healthy, but her mother, maternal grandmother and two of
her mother's sisters had died of breast cancer before they reached
50.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew growing up, my whole life, that women in my family got
breast cancer and died,'' said Ms. Mishkin, who tested positive for
a mutation in BRCA1. ``It was not a question of, will I get it?''
she said. ``It was a question of when.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mishkin said she had no regrets over having her breasts
removed, and said she believes doctors have been overly hesitant
about recommending the procedure to high-risk women.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't recommend it or not recommend it,'' she said of
her own operation. ``But now, with this study, they can say this
will reduce your risk 90 percent. They'll have to tell their
patients it's an option.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Susan Love, a breast cancer expert and professor of surgery
at the University of California at Los Angeles, said that, thanks
to the study, ``Women who want to do this know they will at least
have some benefit. But it should drive us hard to find better
prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Love said she did a few prophylactic mastectomies, but only
after several months of discussions with patients. ``Sometimes your
sister or mother gets diagnosed and you're so panicked you want a
quick fix,'' she said. ``I would suggest that women not choose to
do this at that moment in time.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said it was important to remember that seven women in
the study got breast cancer even though their breasts were removed.
``Nobody should come away thinking it's a guarantee,'' she said.

ASU MAKING GAINS ON COURT  
 ARIZONA STILL LEADING WAY, EVANS PLANS TO CUT MARGIN 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   First there was Bob Weinhauer, followed by Steve Patterson and
Bill Frieder. And let's not forget Bob Schermerhorn and Don Newman,
the temps. Hello, fellas. And goodbye. Arizona basketball Coach
Lute Olson not only rules an empire that stretches far beyond the
peaks of Tucson's Catalina Mountains, he has survived all five of
his Arizona State counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   But chances are, he will not outlast the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Evans, who coaches the Sun Devils against Olson and the
Wildcats for the first time tonight at Wells Fargo Arena, is in
Year 1 of a five-year contract, which he does not expect to be his
only. At 52, he plans on sticking around awhile. Olson, in his 16th
season at Arizona, is 64 with what amounts to a lifetime contract.
He will go when he's ready, but it likely will be sooner rather
than later.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving his snow tires in Iowa and replacing Ben Lindsey
before the 1983-84 season, Olson has created and reigned over one
of college basketball's showpiece programs. Roll the credits: 14
straight NCAA Tournaments, 11 straight 20-win seasons, eight Pac-10
titles, three Final Fours, one national championship.
</P>
<P>
   It also is a program that has relegated ASU hoops to
second-class status within the state, with only a couple of
aberrations. One was in Olson's first season, when he cleaned up
Lindsey's 4-24 toxic spill and produced an 11-17 record, his only
losing year. ASU, meanwhile, went 13-15 under Weinhauer, and both
teams were 8-10 in conference.
</P>
<P>
   From that point, Arizona left ASU in a vapor trail.
</P>
<P>
   The other blip registered in 1994-95, when the Wildcats lost to
Miami (Ohio) in the first round of the NCAA Tournament and ASU,
coached by Frieder, made it to the Sweet 16. But even that season,
Arizona finished second in the Pac-10, ASU third. No Olson-coached
team has ever trailed ASU in the final standings.
</P>
<P>
   That also was the season the Sun Devils, led by Mario Bennett,
managed to beat the Wildcats twice, 53-52, in Tempe and, 103-98, in
double-overtime in Tucson, a game in which three Arizona starters
were either hurt or suspended because of a pending NCAA
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It remains the only year Olson has lost two games to the Sun
Devils. In fact, it usually works the other way around. The Cats
have swept the Sun Devils in 11 of Olson's 15 seasons. Overall,
Olson is 25-5 against ASU. He was 4-0 vs. Weinhauer, 6-1 against
Patterson and 1-0 against Schermerhorn, who briefly replaced
Patterson in 1989. Frieder had a comparatively glittering 4-12
record against his Bank One commercials partner. Newman was 0-2
last year after Frieder resigned under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Evans' turn. Although he says that catching up to
Arizona is not part of his official mandate, he doesn't pretend to
ignore the giant located just 100 miles away, nor the state
supremacy the Wildcats have earned and enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Challenges? I love challenges,'' Evans said. ``And this is a
huge challenge. Lute's done a tremendous job down there and will
continue to do a tremendous job. That doesn't mean the two programs
can't coexist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a healthy challenge. The job Lute's done at Arizona makes
everybody _ not only me but Cal, Oregon, Oregon State, everybody _
step to the plate and get better. And if you don't get better
you'll get buried. It's a positive thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Certain that ASU has the resources necessary to compete with
Arizona, Evans already seems on course to narrow the gap. His first
full recruiting class was judged to be among the best in the
Pac-10, if not the nation. Significantly, Evans landed probably the
three best players in Arizona _ Donnell Knight of Tempe Corona del
Sol High School, Tanner Shell of Mesa Mountain View and Tommy Smith
of North. None fit Arizona's needs, but Evans is thrilled to have
them.
</P>
<P>
   The year before, Newman brought in Kenny Crandall of Mountain
View and Greenway's Chad Prewitt, although the plum of the
recruiting class, Richard Jefferson of Moon Valley, went to
Arizona. But no longer can it be assumed that the best in-state
players, such as Jefferson and Mike Bibby, are automatically
ticketed for Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   The potential of ASU and the presence of Evans has not been lost
on Olson, who said he has no problem with ASU getting better.
Although not ``too'' good, probably.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be great for everyone,'' he said. ``Yes, when
we play one another, it should be a war. But when we play other
people, we should be cheering for each other. There would be
nothing better than the two Arizona teams finishing 1-2 in the
Pac-10.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson said ASU asked whether he would be interested in the head
coaching job after Ned Wulk was fired in 1982. But Olson, who was
at Iowa at the time, was surprised when he heard what the job was
worth. That, he said, reflected a lack of commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me, `Well, we've got the Suns in town we can't
afford to put together a package to get it done,' '' he said. ``My
response was, `You can't afford to have 8,000 empty seats.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's different now. Athletic Director Kevin White is a willing
and active partner with Evans in renovating the program. After
witnessing his first ASU-Arizona game in Tucson a couple of years
ago, White said there is every reason to believe the same
basketball environment can exist in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get better,'' he said at the time. ``I think
everyone realizes that.''
</P>
<P>
   White since has taken steps toward that by increasing the scope,
functions and purpose of the entire athletic department. Basketball
has benefited from that, and will continue to be a high priority.
The ongoing fund-raising campaign is expected to produce $5 million
to $7 million in upgrades for Wells Fargo Arena, including a new
fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   `I've known Kevin White a long time,'' said Olson. ``Kevin
recognizes the success of the entire athletic program to the entire
university.''
</P>
<P>
   But White said the main impetus for change is Evans, whom he
hired last April.
</P>
<P>
   ``What transformed the environment at Arizona was the hiring of
Lute Olson,'' White said. ``It triggered a transformation and I
think we have the opportunity here to enjoy the same type of thing.
Rob is clearly doing what needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   In one aspect of the ASU-Arizona series, the teams have achieved
parity. Although the Wildcats have won six straight overall,
Arizona is 4-3 in Tempe dating to 1991-92. And every game has been
close. The Cats have averaged 78.57 points a game during that
stretch, the Sun Devils 78.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight should follow that form. The Wildcats are ranked No. 7
nationally, but no one, Olson especially, believes they are as good
as they will be. The Sun Devils, finally grasping Evans' system and
philoso phy, are playing well. Arizona is led by a pair of seniors,
guard Jason Terry and A.J. Bramlett, and probably will start three
freshmen. ASU has three proven veterans _ senior forwards Bobby
Lazor and Mike Batiste, and junior guard Eddie House.
</P>
<P>
   Terry, House and Lazor are 1-2-3, respectively, in the Pac-10 in
scoring. Batiste would be fourth, but hasn't played enough games to
qualify.
</P>
<P>
   For ASU, Crandall likely will start and Prewitt will play a
large role, too. They were teammates with Jefferson on the Arizona
Stars club team the past couple of summers. Crandall and Jefferson
never opposed each other in high school, but Prewitt knows
Jefferson all too well. Last year, Greenway was 0-5 against Moon
Valley, including a loss in the Class 4A title game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more playing against the U of A than playing against
Richard,'' Prewitt said. ``But there's that, too.'' &QL;

MARKET PLACE: RED FLAGS OVER BRAZIL GET WALL STREET'S ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>

 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Yogi Berra once observed, it's deja vu all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, which Wednesday devalued its currency, the real, and
announced the resignation of its central bank president, Gustavo
Franco, is the latest victim of the global financial contagion that
first broke out in Southeast Asia about 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   And, as was the case when Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and
Russia each broke under the pressure of excessive debt and
weakening currencies, there is now ample hand wringing about the
U.S. financial community's exposure to Brazil's travails.
</P>
<P>
   While Brazil's problems are certain to be a negative for U.S.
banks, brokerage firms, mutual and hedge funds and other investors
in the country, it is still too early to know how extensive the
damage will be. Most financial concerns have been reducing their
exposure to Brazil since Russia's devaluation sent markets into a
tailspin last summer and fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets tend to overreact to these events, but we won't
know until the rest of the story plays out,'' said Raphael Soifer,
an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. ``But it's never a
good thing when currencies are devalued and central bankers
resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Brazil's fate depends on whether the country can
achieve its goal of allowing the real to fall no further than
another 12 percent against the dollar this year. A similar effort
by the Russian government to gradually devalue its currency, the
ruble, failed miserably last August largely because confidence in
the ruble and the Russian government had evaporated. The real fell
8.4 percent against the dollar Wednesday, to 75.65 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reaction when the devaluation was first announced in
Brazil was pretty bad there, but it appears that locals aren't
converting reals into dollars because they know if everybody
stampedes for the door it will only get worse,'' said Felipe Garcia
Ascencio, an analyst with IDEA Inc., a research firm in New York.
``The Latin American and U.S. economies will be hurt because
financial activity in the region will be much slower. And everybody
is worried that China will be next. So the key thing is to wait and
see if this remains a controlled devaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's ability to control the devaluation will be driven by
its willingness to spend precious reserves defending the real. The
central bank has kept interest rates artificially high to prop up
the real while the country tries to introduce fiscal reforms. In
the meantime, the central bank's dollar reserves have plunged to
about $31 billion from $75 billion last summer as dollars continue
to flee the country. Hundreds of millions of dollars a day have
left the country this month as reals are converted into dollars,
with about $2 billion withdrawn Wednesday alone, according to 4Cast
Inc., a New York research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Financial services concerns have been anticipating a devaluation
in Brazil for some time, and most say they have ample reserves to
absorb any losses there. ``Brazil is not a surprise,'' said Leslie
Daniels Webster, head of market risk management at Chase Manhattan
Corp. ``It's like General Franco's dying. It was long rumored,'' he
added, referring to the protracted final illness of Spain's
dictator, who died in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. banks had about $16.7 billion of loans and other assets in
Brazil at the end of June, the largest amount of any Latin American
country, according to the Bank for International Settlements. But
most U.S. banks have been cutting back since then.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's banking unit, Citibank, had about $3.9 billion of
assets in Brazil at the end of September, the same amount held by
Chase. BankAmerica had about $3.3 billion at the end of 1998's
third quarter, while J.P. Morgan had $2.2 billion, Bankers Trust
had $900 million and BankBoston had $860 million. While
BankBoston's exposure is the largest relative to its size, all the
banks said Brazil alone does not pose a threat to their financial
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Among European banks, Spanish and Portuguese lenders are heavily
exposed to Brazil. German banks have also been among the biggest
lenders to Brazil and other countries in South America. In a report
last November, the Bank for International Settlements noted that
German banks were ``taking the lead in the supply of fresh funds to
Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   Specific data on mutual funds' investments in Brazil are not
kept, but open-end equity funds that have at least 10 percent of
their assets in Brazil owned $6.3 billion in stock there as of last
November, according to Lipper Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street brokerage and investment banking firms have for
years put Brazil near the top of their lists of emerging-market
priorities. A surge of investment in the stock market there and the
Brazilian government's promise to sell state-owned property
attracted every major U.S. investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   But many of these firms said that they, like commercial banks,
had been steadily reducing their financial exposure to Brazil.
Investment bankers and analysts said losses from protracted
weakness in Brazil would be small in comparison with the hundreds
of millions of dollars many lost when Russia triggered last year's
financial panic.
</P>
<P>
   Exposure for most brokerage firms is minimal, analysts said.
``Ever since the emerging markets blew up, they have been working
hard to reduce their exposure,'' said Guy Moszkowski, brokerage
industry analyst for Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., for example, had substantial exposure to
emerging-market debt until the Russian crisis but has since taken
steps to reduce that exposure, Moszkowski said. Likewise for
another big emerging-markets player, Lehman Brothers. Industry
experts estimate that Lehman has just over $100 million in total
exposure in Brazil, substantially reduced from the peak 1998
levels. Citigroup's investment banking unit, Salomon Smith Barney,
is also believed to have little direct exposure to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The investment bank with the greatest stake in Brazil is Credit
Suisse First Boston. The Swiss-American bank six months ago paid
$675 million to buy Garantia SA, a leading Brazilian investment
bank.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse First Boston reduced Garantia's inventory of
Brazilian government bonds recently and hedged its exposure to the
market, preparing for the possibility of a devaluation, people who
work at the bank said. Moreover, Garantia made profits last year
and continues to operate profitably this month, Credit Suisse
employees said.
</P>
<P>
   Another significant difference between the Russian and Brazilian
crises is that hedge funds, among the hottest of the hot money
players that dart in and out of markets, have pulled back from
Brazil since last summer, thus limiting the sense of panic
surrounding Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any relative complacency about Brazil _ exemplified,
perhaps, by how easily the U.S. stock market shrugged off Brazil's
bad news Wednesday _ will be tempered by how viciously and quickly
its problems affect other markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. market's reaction speaks volumes about the underlying
resilience of this market,'' Alan Ruskin, research director at
4Cast, noted in a report Wednesday. ``It needs a knockout punch to
severely dent the U.S. equity market, and Brazil in isolation is
not it. But Brazil, Argentina, Hong Kong and China in quick
sequence would provide a devastating backdrop that would draw the
Fed back into `rescue the world' mode again, firing on all
salvos.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: A VERY COLD SEND-OFF FOR THE HOTTEST ATHLETE
</HEADLINE>

 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Pardon me for being a little disappointed, I just
expected more. This was retirement day for Michael Jordan, a player
we have called the greatest ever, and the send-off was flat. Not
simply flat, but chilly.
</P>
<P>
   On a day that marked the retirement of arguably the most
significant athlete of this century, there was a distinct coldness
between management and player. Jordan, with his wife, Juanita, on
his right, Commissioner David Stern on his left and Chicago Bulls'
chairman Jerry Reinsdorf at the table, confirmed reports that he
was leaving the National Basketball Association. Leaving the league
he dominated; walking away from the game he loved. The man who made
winter in America bearable for Chicagoans, and enjoyable, is
history.
</P>
<P>
   This was not an emotion-filled farewell, rather an icy goodbye
that had the finality of a divorce, not the cuddly warmth of a
retirement. This was a flat ending for a man whose career has been
built on drama. On Wednesday, there was no emotion, no video
highlights.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan joked that he was thinking of showing up and simply
saying, ``I'm gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``then I figured I owed the media and the
fans more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Jordan ended months of speculation and announced that
he was stepping away. Was this bland atmosphere a result of poor
planning or bad blood?
</P>
<P>
   There has been little love, and little love lost, between Jordan
and team management, particularly between Jordan and Jerry Krause,
the Bulls' general manager. Krause has insisted that organization
and structure had as much, if not more, to do with the team's
astounding success as Jordan did. Jordan simply agreed with what
the world said: that he's the man.
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf said this was a dreaded day, yet you got the distinct
sense that the Bulls could not wait for this to come. With Jordan
finally out of the way, Reinsdorf and Krause can prove, once and
for all, the supremacy of the franchise over the players. This is
what the six-month lockout was about, and the wounds are fresh.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, I suppose this wasn't the time to expect
cuddly. This was a day when who wasn't here and what wasn't said
put the environment in much sharper perspective. Phil Jackson, the
former head coach, was missing, as was Scottie Pippen, Jordan's
other basketball half, and Ron Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf read from a script Wednesday afternoon; Krause never
spoke but stood off to the side with Tim Floyd, who was hired over
the protests of Jordan, who insisted that his preference was for
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the day's potentially dramatic moments, the team
unfurled a banner with Jordan's retired number. The only problem
was that the banner was old. It read: 1984-1993, marking the day
when Jordan retired to mourn the death of his father and to try
playing professional baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan seemed surprised when Reinsdorf presented Jordan with his
1998 championship ring. Why present the ring Wednesday? It was as
if Jordan was being told not to bother coming on ring night. Ring
night _ that should be quite a scene _ a standing ovation for
Jordan, cascades of boos for Krause.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe too much is being read into all this. I just expected
more.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a player who lifted Chicago from a slaughterhouse,
backwater basketball town into a championship city. The Chicago
sports scene was a losers' scene. The Bears haven't won a
championship since 1985; the Blackhawks won their last Stanley Cup
in 1961; the White Sox haven't won a World Series since 1917; and
the Cubs haven't won a championship in 90 years. The Bulls' six
championships elevated Chicago to elite status.
</P>
<P>
   ``For what Michael has meant to the NBA,'' Reinsdorf said
Wednesday, ``this number could very well be retired in every NBA
arena.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan will still generate more than $500 million in revenue for
the NBA this year. In a survey last June, The Sports Marketing
Letter projected that Jordan would make $42 million from his
sponsors in the next year. This puts him ahead of Tiger Woods ($30
million) and Shaquille O'Neal ($28 million).
</P>
<P>
   One got the sense Wednesday that the most satisfying aspect of
retirement for Jordan was that it gave him one more opportunity to
shoot one last winning shot over the outstretched hands of an
opponent by retiring. He is denying three generations of opponents
the privilege of defeating him.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing. Karl Malone. Charles Barkley. They will spend the
rest of their careers chasing a ghost.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all wanted me to come back just so that if they win a
championship,'' Jordan said, ``they can say they had gone through
Chicago or Michael Jordan to win it, to give it the meaning of
taking the title away from Chicago. Patrick won't be able to live
with himself if he can't beat Michael Jordan in a series; and
Charles Barkley, I told him he would never win, because he doesn't
dedicate himself to winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after noon here, the retirement announcement ended, and
Jordan went home to begin his new life with his wife and family.
Reinsdorf, Krause and Floyd went back to their offices and dug into
the challenge of rebuilding the Bulls.

PRAISE FOR JORDAN FROM ALL CORNERS

   Some praised his ability to soar gracefully over defenders who
were nearly a foot taller. Others spoke reverentially of his
competitiveness, the trait that forced him to work tirelessly at
honing skills that were already legendary. Still others paid
tribute to the charisma and advertising acumen that enabled him to
become the premier pitchman in sports.
</P>
<P>
   But among all the words of homage for Michael Jordan on
Wednesday by those linked with the National Basketball Association,
one theme remained constant: No. 23 of the Bulls was the greatest
player in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan is the best player that's ever laced 'em up,''
said Bob Cousy, the Hall of Fame guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pound for pound, he was the best ever,'' said Julius Erving,
who as Dr. J first brought to the NBA the high-flying wizardry that
made Jordan so dynamic. ``He's the most electric, has the most
charisma and the most flair.''
</P>
<P>
   Current players, from former Dream Team members Reggie Miller
and Joe Dumars to up-and-coming stars like Keith Van Horn, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am telling you he's not human,'' Miller said. ``Has anyone
ever seen him bleed? I have not seen blood yet. Something is going
on here. He is not human.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jordan possessed outstanding athleticism, the consensus
was that his quickness, strength and leaping ability were not the
only attributes that set him apart. It was his capacity to combine
those qualities with a superior work ethic, an incredible degree of
mental toughness and a matchless desire to win. Jordan's dedication
to improvement and winning was renowned.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton noted that Jordan's excellence was not limited
to his physical ability. ``In my life, I don't know that I ever saw
another athlete with such a remarkable set of qualities of mind,
body and spirit,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Many said that Jordan's amazing accomplishments were born of his
tremendous drive to be the best. It was his hatred of finishing
second that led him to score 38 points while ailing from the
stomach flu in Game 5 of the 1997 NBA finals against Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The list of those he conquered in winning titles in the final
six full seasons he played is awesome: Magic Johnson, Larry Bird,
Isiah Thomas, Karl Malone, Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley, Pat
Riley, Chuck Daly and Lenny Wilkens.
</P>
<P>
   Some current players and coaches said they wished Jordan had not
retired, so they could have had another opportunity to beat him.
But they had plenty, and failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I lay my head down on the pillow at night, I'll know
there was one guy I never had a chance to beat,'' said Riley, the
Miami Heat coach who won five championship rings before Jordan
began his reign. ``It doesn't look like I'll get another chance.
That bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's success on the court, plus his easygoing personality
and charm, enabled him to prosper just as much on Madison Avenue.
Before he entered the league, only a handful of players had
signature basketball shoes or endorsements of any kind. But his
ability to relate to Americans of all ages and colors landed him
deals with Nike, McDonald's, Gatorade, Hanes and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   When his Air Jordan sneakers helped Nike become the world's
leader in basketball apparel, marketers began giving out
million-dollar deals to dozens of players, a development that
changed the way many younger players viewed professional
basketball. To some, the game became the means to a larger pile of
cash to be made outside of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Iverson, the 76ers' star guard, said Jordan inspired him
to not only be a basketball player, but also to be an endorsement
magnet. ``With all his off-the-court marketing and everything he
did, it makes me want to do something like that in my life,'' said
Iverson, who signed a multimillion-dollar shoe contract with Reebok
out of college. ``He set the standard for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody is not limited to America or even the Western
Hemisphere. His once-in-a-generation game and his seemingly
boundless commercial appeal turned him into not only a cultural
icon but also a global hero, one whose influence on the world
through sports is comparable only to a Muhammad Ali or a Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   That was clear by the fact that newspapers throughout the world
ran front-page articles about Jordan's retirement in Wednesday's
editions. Papers in London, Rome, Spain, France, Japan and
Australia, to name a few, did that.
</P>
<P>
   La Repubblica in Rome wrote: ``America would willingly take
Clinton's retirement in exchange for Jordan's. Not only was Jordan
the best basketball player ever. He was basketball.''

A BREACH IN THE FIRE WALL THE UNITED STATES TRIED TO BUILD AROUND
BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)  (See also: BRAZIL-RDP, BRAZIL-IMPACT, BRAZIL-HISTORY BRAZIL-BONDS,
BRAZIL-LATIN, MARKET) 
(sw) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton and Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin announced two months ago what they termed a
``precautionary'' $41.5 billion aid package for Brazil, they
described it as the first test of a new strategy to help countries
reform their economies before they are overwhelmed by the
tumultuous global market forces that have swept from Asia to Russia
to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the Brazilians committed to change their
free-spending ways and said their government was ``fully
committed'' to maintaining the value of its currency _ a commitment
that nations throughout Latin America said was vital if there was
any hope of keeping the rest of Latin America from descending into
a nasty recession.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after watching billions continue to pour out of the
country after their legislature balked at many of the toughest
reforms, the Brazilians have allowed their currency to fall. Many
suspect it is the first of a series of devaluations that could
resonate around the Americas, and perhaps around the world. And it
confronts Clinton, Rubin and the International Monetary Fund with a
painful choice: whether to continue pumping aid into a country that
seems reluctant to reform or to stand back, even if that means
risking a re-ignition of the economic turmoil that followed
Russia's economic crisis last summer.
</P>
<P>
   In carefully worded statements on Wednesday, neither Clinton nor
Rubin tipped his hand _ or promised much more help. ``It is
important that Brazil carry forward the implementation of a strong,
credible economic program,'' Rubin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In private, other administration officials predicted that
Brazil's problems would not trigger another selloff around the
world, the way panicked investors and lenders fled from developing
nations five months ago. The world economy is less brittle now,
they said, and investors are a lot better prepared and more savvy
than they were five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality, one senior administration official said on
Wednesday afternoon, is that ``none of us really know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a breach of the fire wall that we spent months building
around Brazil,'' said another official, one of the president's top
economic advisers. ``It's hard to overestimate the anger around
here about how the Brazilians wasted time when they needed to deal
with their problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire wall was a $41.5 billion ``precautionary'' aid program
for Brazil, including a $5 billion direct contribution from the
United States. The idea was to buy some time for Brazil, to enable
it to keep its economy together and its currency strong, while the
government implemented a detailed economic plan negotiated with the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also a fire wall for the United States: Brazil is one
of America's largest trading partners, and a huge market for
American corporations. A deep recession there, it was feared, would
be felt in the United States far more sharply than the downturn in
Southeast Asia, where America's economic interests are more
limited.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton and Rubin, the fire wall was also the first test of
a new strategy for coping with global economic instability. Their
idea was to aid countries before they got into deep trouble, the
kind of trouble that caused havoc for the economies of South Korea,
Indonesia, Thailand and Russia. ``It is far better to help a
country when it is still fundamentally healthy,'' Rubin said last
fall, ``and when it is easier to make economic reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   But the whole strategy hinged on the willingness of Brazil's
unpredictable legislature to enact a cutback program _ including
sharp and politically unpopular budget reductions that began to
strip away many of the government-provided benefits that Brazilians
had come to expect, but which their country could no longer afford.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature balked at many of the cuts. And ever since,
unconvinced that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso had the
political power to push through the rest of the package, investors
have continued to flee the country.
</P>
<P>
   The slow flight to the exits turned into a rush on Tuesday, when
$1.2 billion fled the country. The immediate cause was a challenge
to Cardoso from a tempestuous former president of Brazil, Itamar
Franco, now governor of the state of Minas Gerais. Franco said he
would refuse to pay the state's debts to the federal government,
claiming his coffers had been emptied by the economic downturn that
has swept the country. If he paid the cash, he said, there would be
little left for food, or salaries for state workers, or other
social programs. Investors concluded, rightly or wrongly, that
Cardoso was not firmly in control.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of unpredictable event that has recurred time
and again in the world financial crisis _ a clash between the
demands of global investors and the political imperatives of
countries that are tired of being told by the IMF how to run their
economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This calls into question the whole efficacy of the American
strategy,'' said Clyde Prestowitz, the president of the Economic
Strategy Institute and a former Commerce Department official. ``The
whole assumption of the administration's approach is that we are
going to aid countries that are committed to getting their act
together. But if it's a big or important country _ Russia because
of its nuclear power, Brazil because of its economic power _ there
is a temptation to simply hope that they will get their act
together. And the Brazilians didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are three big risks ahead now.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that Brazil will sink into an even deeper recession
than the one it has been facing for months. To defend the currency
at its newly devalued level, Brazil will probably have to keep
interest rates extremely high for the near future. But that, in
turn, could choke off economic activity _ at a time that factories
are closing and middle-class workers are finding their jobs
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real risk at this point that this could deteriorate
badly,'' said Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co. ``The question is whether they can contain the devaluation and
get the reform program moving. Because there really is no Plan B.''
</P>
<P>
   The second risk is that contagion will be reignited, at least in
the region, perhaps beyond. Because the Latin American economies
are so interlinked, many economists were warning on Wednesday that
Argentina and Chile could easily fall into recession. That prospect
_ and the social unrest it could engender _ was clearly on the mind
of President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina, during his visit this
week to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see the tension on their faces,'' said one
administration official who met with Menem and his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   And finally there is the challenge to American credibility.
After the failure of the rescue plan in Russia, Rubin and Clinton
have a lot riding on their bet in Brazil. In November, with the Dow
Jones industrial average still down and nervousness about global
economic trouble still fresh, Congress said not a word about
putting $5 billion in American funds at risk.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, Rep. Jim Saxton, R-N.J., who chairs the House
Joint Economic Committee, called the ``precautionary'' package a
``costly, counterproductive failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's view is, predictably, quite different. ``I start from
the view that the Brazilian program should work,'' he said Tuesday
afternoon, as rumors of the devaluation were beginning to swirl.
``It was a good program that was announced. Cardoso is deeply
committed to getting this done.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``The politics obviously are the key.''

FOR MICHAEL JORDAN, THERE WERE NO MORE MOUNTAINS TO CLIMB 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL MURPHY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The City of Big Shoulders needs a shoulder to cry on
today.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan, who redefined basketball with his
gravity-defying moves and intense will to win, officially announced
his retirement from the National Basketball Association on
Wednesday morning during a packed news conference at the United
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, Jordan said, was simple. There were no more worlds
to conquer, no challenges he has not already met during his 13
years with the NBA's Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   So it was time to move on. And time for the league to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel I have a challenge,'' Jordan said. ``Physically,
I feel great. I know from a career standpoint I've accomplished
everything I could as an individual. Right now, I don't have the
mental challenges that I've had in the past to proceed as a
basketball player. I'm pretty sure people will say, `Well, there's
a lot of different challenges that could evolve.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But for me to start something and then lose interest and my
motivation in the middle of the season, it's unfair to the people
that I'm working with and working for, and to the fans. So I
(avoided that) by saying this is a perfect time for me to walk away
from the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm at peace with that.''
</P>
<P>
   That much was obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who was joined on a midcourt podium by his wife,
Juanita, NBA Commissioner David Stern and Bulls Chairman Jerry
Reinsdorf, seemed very much at ease, throwing out zingers at
longtime rivals Charles Barkley and Patrick Ewing and smiling
often.
</P>
<P>
   There was none of the tear-stained emotion that some expected,
which may rank among the 35-year-old Jordan's most impressive
career accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing a good job of trying to hold back the emotions, but
it's like taking away something that I truly have loved for the
last (24 years),'' he said. ``It's sad that I'm leaving the game,
but it's happy because my life is starting to go into a whole other
stage. Basketball for me was the first stage; it got me to this
point in my life. I knew it had to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life takes on a different stage now, and it's a different
challenge, and I welcome that, and I knew it was coming. So I'm
happy that it's gotten to this point, and I'm happy that you guys
(the media) didn't run me out of the game. I chose to walk away
knowing that I can still play the game, and that's what I've always
wished for my career to end _ that's exactly the way I wanted to
end it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not quite the way Reinsdorf wanted the Jordan era to end,
however. Reinsdorf was attempting to reunite Jordan, Scottie
Pippen, Dennis Rodman and coach Phil Jackson for one last title
run. Instead, the Bulls, the most dominant NBA team of the 1990s,
will likely be starting from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This a day that I think I hoped would never come,'' said a
somber Reinsdorf. ``It has to be the toughest day in the history of
the Chicago Bulls. It's a tough day for Chicago. It's a tough day
for the NBA. It's a tough day for basketball fans all over the
world and for Michael Jordan fans all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a sad day,'' he said. ``This is a great day,
because the greatest basketball player in the history of the game
is getting the opportunity to retire with the grace that described
his play.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf unveiled a banner celebrating Jordan's No. 23, which
has been retired by the Bulls for a second time. And contrary to
what happened after his first ``retirement'' in 1993, Jordan says
he won't return. After all, that first retirement wasn't on his own
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Still haunted by the recent murder of his father, James, Jordan
said he had accomplished everything he could in basketball and
wanted to try his hand at minor-league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But most everyone knew he would be back.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1995, Jordan did return. It didn't take long to discover
he could no longer dominate the game the way he once did, a point
that was underscored when the Bulls were eliminated in six games by
Orlando in the Eastern Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The most stinging aspect of that loss was hearing the whispers
that he could never again be the Jordan who carried Chicago to
three straight NBA titles between 1991 and '93.
</P>
<P>
   That was all the motivation he needed.
</P>
<P>
   F. Scott Fitzgerald may have written, ``There are no second acts
in American lives,'' but Jordan went about proving him wrong. Act
II in Chicago meant three more NBA titles, and Jordan was the
motivating force behind all three.
</P>
<P>
   His goodbye kiss came last June in Salt Lake City, when Jordan's
last-second shot in Game 6 of the NBA Finals settled into the net
to beat the Jazz and lift the Bulls to their sixth title in this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made his last shot to win a world championship,'' said
Barkley, one of Jordan's closest friends. ``What more do you need?
That's every player's fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   As if Jordan, whom Lakers general manager and NBA Hall of Famer
Jerry West recently called a ``modern-day Babe Ruth,'' needed
another fantasy fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of his career, Jordan not only captured six
titles but also won five Most Valuable Player awards and six NBA
Finals MVPs. He was named Rookie of the Year (1985) and Defensive
Player of the Year (1988) and won an NBA-record 10 scoring titles.
He appeared in 11 All-Star Games (missing a 12th because of
injury), taking home the MVP trophy three times. And Jordan's
31.5-point career scoring average is the best in NBA history, as is
his playoff average of 33.4 points.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, he walked away and said he has no intention of
looking back. Instead, Jordan said he will devote himself to being
a father to his three children, Jeffrey, Marcus and Jasmine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never say never, but I'm 95 (to) 99.9 percent (certain),''
said Jordan when asked if he would change his mind and come back.
``I'm very secure with my decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult, because you're giving up something that you
truly, truly love. My love for the game is very strong. It's hard
to give up that love.''
</P>
<P>
   But give it up he did.
</P>
<P>
   All that will be left are the banners, the last of which will be
raised at some point during the Bulls' home opener this season, and
the statue that stands outside the United Center, erected in 1994
after Jordan's first retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best there ever was,'' reads the inscription. ``The best
there ever will be.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Officials waiting on word from Bush before moving on Everglades
permit
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ South Florida water managers said
Wednesday they will keep negotiating and await word from Gov. Jeb
Bush before accepting or rejecting a federal permit for part of the
$763 million Everglades cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar growers say the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's
permit would require impossible pollution standards, adding up to
$2 billion to the costs. EPA officials say they're just enforcing
the law, and environmentalists say the limits will ensure that the
Everglades is really cleansed.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said Bush wants to review the dispute, including
whether to accept a Dec. 31 decision by then-Gov. Buddy MacKay to
go along with the EPA's plans.

 &HT;    `Tremendous anticipation' fills new bishop
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. _ A new bishop for the Roman Catholic
Diocese of Palm Beach began a two-day ceremony of taking office
Wednesday at St. Ignatius Loyola Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   In a solemn service of evening prayer, the papal letter
appointing the Most Rev. Anthony Joseph O'Connell bishop of the
diocese was read.
</P>
<P>
   An official delegation of senior priests in the diocese, which
includes the Treasure Coast, verified the validity of the document
before a congregation of about 700 people made up largely of
diocesan clergy civic leaders and non-Catholic religious
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He presented to us, the college of consultants, his
credentials, his letter of appointment,'' said the Rev. Francis
Lechiara, pastor of St. Edward Catholic Church in Palm Beach. ``We
signed it.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual installation takes place at an invitation-only
service at 2 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday evening's service helped ease the requirements of
today's liturgy and allowed more people to be part of the ceremony,
O'Connell said.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop preached about his coming to Palm Beach. ``I have a
tremendous anticipation of the blessing the Lord has given us.''
</P>
<P>
   The clergy of the diocese presented him with a shepherd's staff,
the symbol of his office.
</P>
<P>
   Invited guests included U.S. Rep. Mark Foley, R-West Palm Beach;
Ted Lapkin, director of community relations for the Jewish
Federation of Palm Beach County; Joseph Russo, mayor of Palm Beach
Gardens; the Rev. Cary Robb, rector of St. Mark's Episcopal Church
in Palm Beach Gardens; and Rabbi and Mrs. Merle Singer from Temple
Beth El in Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jewish/Catholic community has enjoyed a fine interfaith
relationship,'' Singer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it is important to be at the prayer service leading to
his installation as part of welcoming the leader of the Catholic
church to Palm Beach County.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish-born O'Connell has been the bishop of the Diocese of
Knoxville in Tennessee for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   He replaces Bishop J. Keith Symons, who resigned in disgrace in
June after admitting inappropriate sexual behavior early in his
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell will lead 220,000 Catholics in Palm Beach, Martin, St.
Lucie, Indian River and Okeechobee counties.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was delighted to begin his ministry here with a
congregation that represented the diversity of the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in coalitions,'' O'Connell said. ``I believe that
people of faith need to work together. No one has the fullness of
God. I think we have an obligation to work together.''

CARDINAL BETTER AFTER INJURIES?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanford rolled into town Wednesday evening, alone in first
place, ranked fourth and winner of nine straight. While the rest of
the Pacific-10 fights like siblings, scratching and clawing on the
living-room floor, the Cardinal watches from afar, an amused big
brother too mature to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of 18 conference games have been decided by three points or
less. Three have ended in overtime. Through it all, Stanford sits
at 3-0, with an average victory margin of 14.3 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Stanford loses, it would be a surprise,'' Arizona coach
Lute Olson said. ``The rest of us keep banging away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal has been so dominant, several Pac-10 coaches
believe the early-season injuries to three key reserves _ point
guard Mike McDonald (foot), shooter Ryan Mendez (knee) and center
Jason Collins (wrist), the Harvard-Westlake alum _ actually made
Stanford better.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've almost gotten stronger with the injuries,'' said
Oregon coach Ernie Kent, a former Stanford assistant whose team
lost by 18 points in Maples Pavilion two weeks ago. ``They have
forced (coach) Mike (Montgomery) to play his starters more. It's
helped their continuity and their confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   What was a fabulous 10-man rotation has dwindled to seven, with
wing man David Moseley and forward Jarron Collins as the top
reserves. Combined, they're averaging 9.7 points and 5.7 rebounds
in 32 minutes (conference games only).
</P>
<P>
   McDonald might return next week, but his injury has increased
demands on North Hollywood native Arthur Lee, who's averaging 34
minutes. Freshman Tony Giovacchini plays sparingly and never in
pressure situations.
</P>
<P>
   Mendez is not expected back anytime soon, if at all. Without
him, Montomgery must use Moseley, athletic but an erratic shooter,
as the replacement for both wing guard Kris Weems and small forward
Pete Sauer.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Collins' dislocated wrist means more minutes for his
brother, Jarron, but it also reduces Stanford's margin for error
along the front line. For the first time in two years, foul trouble
is a concern.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery is many things _ sarcastic, cynical, a superb teacher
and tactician _ but he is not a revisionist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how losing good players helps you,'' he said. ``I
don't understand that concept.''
</P>
<P>
   For comparison's sake: After beating USC and UCLA last weekend,
Oregon State guard Josh Steinthal said there's no comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I thought USC was a lot better,'' Steinthal said.
``UCLA wasn't as organized. If you stopped one thing with them,
that's it. But (USC) can do a lot more things. They don't have the
national ranking, but they're a lot better than UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins and Trojans meet next Wednesday in the Sports Arena.
UCLA has won eight straight in the city series, but the gap between
the teams _ as measured by talent and experience _ is smaller this
year than at any time since 1992, when USC, led by Harold Miner,
finished second in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   Around the nation: Remember Brad Millard, the 7-3, 350-pound St.
Mary's center who collided with Wake Forest's Tim Duncan in the
1997 NCAA Tournament? After three surgeries on two different
injuries in his left foot the mammoth Millard is back _ well,
almost.
</P>
<P>
   Following his most recent surgery, in October, he used an
aquatics-based rehabilitation program to avoid pounding on the
brittle bones. Last week, he was cleared for floor exercises, and
St. Mary's hopes he'll return in early March....
</P>
<P>
   Looking for early candidates for national coach of the year? Try
Auburn's Cliff Ellis, Wisconsin's Dick Bennett, Cincinnati's Bob
Huggins and Ohio State's Jim O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   They won't get many votes for national player of the year, but
they should: Cincinnati's Melvin Levett and Auburn's Chris
Porter....
</P>
<P>
   Three of the best players in the West are not Pac-10 residents:
Gonzaga's Matt Santangelo, Boise State's Roberto Bergersen and
Fresno State's Courtney Alexander, a transfer from Virginia.
Bergersen and Alexander are future first-round draft picks. UCLA
fans will have a chance to assess Santangelo in person next season,
when Gonzaga visits Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Pac-10: KMTR television in Eugene, Ore., did a
frame-by-frame, stop-action examination of USC guard Adam Spanich's
game-winning half-court shot. The result: an Oregon official
started the clock 0.5 seconds late....
</P>
<P>
   Arizona had 30 turnovers last week against Washington State, its
highest total in Olson's 16 seasons....
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State's 2-2 start in conference play is its best since
1993....
</P>
<P>
   Something we'll never see again: Stanford missed 17 of 30 free
throws at home against Cal....
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's five freshmen are averaging 40.3 points and 19.1
rebounds. Their UCLA counterparts are averaging 38.7 points and
22.6 rebounds.

GORE SAYS U.S. IS WILLING TO HELP IRAQ GET MORE FOOD AND MEDICINE 
</HEADLINE>
  By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vice President Al Gore said on Wednesday night that
the White House was willing to consider ways to loosen restrictions
on Iraq's ability to buy food and medicine. He emphasized that the
administration's differences were with Saddam Hussein, not with the
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   With the administration facing criticism from some principal
allies over the restrictions on food and medicine, Gore told an
audience of Jewish organizations here that the White House was
considering ways to increase the flow of such essential supplies to
the Iraqi people. In keeping with other administration officials,
he heatedly disputed the notion that the United States was to blame
for food or medicine shortages in Iraq, and said that Saddam
repeatedly had chosen to spend oil revenues on his nation's
military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam has consistently shown that he cares much more about
developing weapons of mass destruction than developing the welfare
of his people,'' Gore said. ``He is the direct cause of suffering
on the part of the Iraqi people.''
</P>
<P>
   Under U.N. sanctions, Iraq is able to sell a limited amount of
oil to raise money for food and medicine imports.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not elaborate on his remarks, which he made during a
speech on the Middle East peace effort to the Israeli Policy Forum,
which brought together an audience of prominent American Jews in
New York. But a senior White House aide said the administration was
examining ways to streamline the delivery of food and medicine to
Iraq, and that the United States would raise the topic at a meeting
of the Security Council on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The aide said the administration was also considering lifting
some sanctions on the sale of oil by Iraq, which were put in place
to punish Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   The White House adviser said the administration was acting, in
part, in response to concerns by allies about the way the embargo
program was being portrayed. The effort to increase the delivery of
essential goods was intended to ``take the issue off the table.''

   NEW YORK _ There was Patrick Ewing, committing a fraternization
sin by sunning with the enemy as he worked out with about a dozen
Heat players in Miami on Wednesday. To the chilly north, just three
New York Knicks were scrimmaging with a collection of fringe free
agents and one Toronto Raptor, Charles Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Ewing probably had a better workout against Alonzo
Mourning than he would have had facing Cleveland Cavalier free
agent Shawnelle Scott at the Knicks' facility. But it is difficult
to take the Knicks' competitive drive seriously when they lack the
togetherness other teams have displayed during this week's informal
workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Training camps will open early next week. Until then, players
are on their own. At least 10 players on each team have shown up
for workouts in Detroit, Utah, Miami and Indiana. As Coach Jeff Van
Gundy hears the reports from other cities, he is dumbfounded by the
Knicks' low turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking for some rationale, I don't have it for why
you wouldn't be there,'' said Van Gundy on a conference call
Wednesday. ``Over all, I don't have an explanation, not a real good
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me if I'd rather have them here and everyone
participating together? Absolutely. But they are not here, and I'm
trying my best not to think about it. I can only worry about what I
can control when we get up and running. It's going to all happen
very quickly. If I see problems because we have guys who are in
poor condition, I have no excuse for that. Whether you're here or
someplace else, you need to be doing your work. You need to be in
shape and at the correct weight. I don't see any reason for any
player not to be that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the regular Knicks working out at the State University of New
York at Purchase _ Allan Houston, John Starks, Marcus Camby and the
free agent Charlie Ward _ everyone appeared in good condition.
Although he bristles at the suggestion that he has grown pudgy,
Ewing looked about 20 pounds overweight before he left town last
Thursday to go on vacation and clear his mind. The mental strain of
leading 430 players through a six-month labor dispute had sapped
his energy. He needed a vacation, and wanted to go somewhere warm.
Ewing's old Georgetown buddy, Mourning, supplied the tropical
getaway and a practice site.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ewing was scheduled to return to New York on Thursday,
one wondered how his two-day workout with the Knicks' division
rival sat with Van Gundy. The Knicks' coach once pointed out that
Michael Jordan befriended opponents, softened them up, and then
took advantage of them on the court. But if Van Gundy was irritated
with Ewing's pick of team facilities, he didn't allow it to show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't have any feeling about that,'' Van Gundy said.
``The important thing is for Patrick to come back mentally
re-charged after a draining few months. Any way he can be at his
best is fine with me. I read where he wanted to clear his mind.
It's probably easier for him to clear his mind in the sunshine.''

ARGENTINA MAY BE NEIGHBOR TO SUFFER MOST FROM BRAZIL'S WOES

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ As shock waves from Brazil's devaluation of its
currency reverberated across Latin America on Wednesday, analysts
said Argentina was likely to be rattled the most severely and that
other countries bordering Brazil would be shaken more than Mexico,
where ties to the U.S. economy would cushion the shock.
</P>
<P>
   The news from Brazil battered all Latin American markets and
several currencies Wednesday as panicked investors sold securities
and rushed to buy dollars. Argentina's market index fell 10.37
percent. The Mexican peso, which floats freely, fell to a historic
low, worth 9.34 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said that when the panic subsided, some economies
in the region would prove more resilient that others.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Argentina can expect to see its interest rates
soar, exports drop and unemployment rise, analysts said. They said
that Argentina, which is Brazil's closest trading partner, was
likely to slide into recession. But at the other extreme, Mexico
will also suffer from volatile interest rates and double-digit
inflation, but with its economic fundamentals in good shape, it
should eke out at least modest growth this year, despite the
Brazilian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Argentina is most vulnerable to the Brazilian crisis, and
Mexico is the least,'' said Luis Luis, managing director at Scudder
Kemper Investments in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's stock market drop was the worst Wednesday. In Peru,
stocks fell 5.45 percent, in Brazil 5.05 percent, in Mexico 4.6
percent, in Chile 3.25 percent and in Venezuela 3.01 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's 9 percent devaluation of the Brazilian real also led
to speculative pressures on other Latin currencies. Peru's sol slid
2.1 percent to a record low, worth 30.6 American cents. The Chilean
peso dropped less than 1 percent. However, the Argentine peso,
which is pegged at one-to-one with the dollar, did not budge, and
the country's economic planning secretary, Rogelio Frigerio, vowed
to defend the currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``One-to-one parity is not a matter for government, but a
requirement and demand of the people,'' Frigerio told Reuters. ``We
are not going to change that position for anything in the world.''
Argentina currently appears to have the muscle to back that vow:
$24 billion in reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Argentine economy is headed for trouble, analysts
said. They had predicted that Argentina's economy would grow 2
percent this year; now they predict zero or negative growth.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of Argentina's exports go to its huge northern
neighbor, and given the revised economic forecasts, they are likely
to drop sharply.
</P>
<P>
   That could lead to social unrest during a presidential election
year. During the regional crisis that followed Mexico's 1994
devaluation, Argentine unemployment rose to 18 percent from 12
percent, but it has since returned to 12 percent, said Luis Secco,
an economist at Estudio Broda Consultores in Buenos Aires. Now as
the Argentine economy shrinks, unemployment could easily surge to
18 percent again, he said. Argentines are to choose President
Carlos Saul Menem's successor in October.
</P>
<P>
   International lending to Latin America has all but stopped since
Russia's default last fall started a stampede from emerging
markets, and a crucial factor for Argentina will be how long it is
until foreign credits begin to flow again, Secco said. Argentina
has a current account deficit of 4.5 percent of its gross domestic
product, and needs to borrow some $7.8 billion this year, about
half of that from overseas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether international credit will flow to Argentina is going
to be a crucial question,'' Secco said.
</P>
<P>
   Peru, which has an annual current account deficit of about $4
billion, will also suffer if international lenders remain nervous
about Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's public finances are even more disorderly, with a
budget deficit of about 7.5 percent of gross domestic product, and
its economy is largely dependent on oil revenues, which have
plunged because of depressed world petroleum prices.
</P>
<P>
   But President-elect Hugo Chavez, whose populist speeches last
year alarmed foreign investors, has so far surprised analysts by
adopting a conciliatory approach to business. Because Venezuela has
little trade with Brazil and its petroleum economy tends to follow
its own dynamics, the outlook is unsettled, but the country is not
likely to suffer greatly from Brazil's devaluation, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, President Ernesto Zedillo's economic team has for
months been preparing carefully for a potential devaluation in
Brazil, and its economy shows few signs of vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's central bank auctioned $200 million Wednesday to slow
the peso's depreciation and tightened the money supply by 30
million pesos, about $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates rose in reaction to the Brazilian devaluation,
but they remained far below the chaotic 50 percent rates reached
during the emerging markets crisis last September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico's economic program is designed to reduce the
vulnerability of our economy to these sorts of foreign financial
shocks,'' the central bank said in a statement Wednesday.
Independent analysts agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the sea of bad news, Mexico doesn't have much to fear
because nobody's tried to protect anything that shouldn't be
protected,'' said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, an economic consultant
here. ``They cut the budget, let the exchange rate take its knocks
and interest rates rise. So our picture is better than what the
Brazilians or the Argentines are looking at now.''

BRAZIL CRISIS WAS TRIGGERED BY POLITICAL FEUD

<P>
   The unraveling of Brazil's economic plan Wednesday began with
the political equivalent of a lover's quarrel last spring. On one
side is a spurned and humiliated former president, Itamar Franco,
and on the other, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the onetime underling
to Franco who had outshone him by becoming president himself.
</P>
<P>
   It was Franco, the president of Brazil in 1993 and 1994 and now
the governor of Minas Gerais state, who set the Brazilian
devaluation in motion by announcing last week that his state would
suspend payments on its $15.4 billion debt for 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Although Minas, as the state is called, had been behind on debt
payments for four months, the governor's declaration drew
investors' attention away from the progress the Brazilian Congress
was making toward passing parts of a $23.5 billion package of
income tax increases and spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it highlighted the financial travails of state
governments and raised doubts about Brazil's underlying solvency as
word spread that nearly a dozen states were behind on their
payments to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has nose-dived 23 percent in the last five
trading days, and Wednesday the Brazilian central bank did what it
had sworn it would never do: devalued the currency by a steep 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The anger that moved Franco, most analysts agree, began last
spring when he tried to win the nomination of his Brazilian
Democratic Movement Party, one of six partners in Cardoso's ruling
coalition, to run against the president in elections scheduled for
October. Cardoso, who had pushed through a constitutional amendment
to allow his own re-election bid, lobbied Franco's party hard to
prevent the Franco candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   When the former president spoke to his party's convention, he
was jeered by politicians who had courted him just a few years
earlier. Even before the party convention began, Franco competed
with Cardoso, who had served under him as finance minister, over
credit for the anti-inflationary economic policy on which Cardoso
built his path to the nation's top job.
</P>
<P>
   After these bitter and scalding experiences, Franco instead ran
for and was elected governor of Minas Gerais in the first round of
balloting in October.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of his Jan. 1 inauguration, Franco announced the
moratorium, throwing in a threat, later rescinded, to delay a $108
million Eurobond payment coming due Feb. 10. With investors already
skittish over Brazil, Franco's mention of a possible moratorium
shook the walls of Brazil's fiscal house, raising questions of its
possible collapse.
</P>
<P>
   One political analyst, David Fleischer of the University of
Brasilia, called the former president's decision ``a spark in the
powder room,'' and said, ``He's been waiting around the corner for
Fernando Henrique and the others who tried to ditch him in the
party convention, and this is what he decided to do as soon as he
got into office.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco's salvo not only had large consequences on the economic
front. It also fanned fears of a political rebellion, pitting state
governors coming into office, many inheriting the overspent budgets
of previous administrations, against a federal government bent on
austerity.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Brazil's 26 other governors have not defied the central
government as openly as Franco has. In a meeting in Sao Luis on
Wednesday night, however, 11 governors demanded that the government
postpone debt payments for 90 to 120 days and that it reduce
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 26 governors working to make a compromise
solution,'' said Walder de Goes, president of the Brazilian
Institute of Political Studies. ``Itamar Franco is crazy,'' de Goes
added. ``He decided to break the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The states, de Goes said, owe the federal government about $40
billion in payments due this year.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government could force the states to pay up by
withholding state shares of government revenue and seizing the
receipts from sales taxes. A state in default also risks seeing its
interest rate jump to 29 percent from 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With his currency plan's survival at stake, and Brazil's
credibility among international investors on the line, Cardoso
appears intent on projecting a stern image. He has warned the
governors that Brazil, at both the state and federal levels, must
meet its debt obligations. ``Rules are made to be followed,'' the
president said at a news conference in Brasilia on Wednesday.

DUELING MIT ECONOMISTS TESTIFY AT MICROSOFT TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY and STEVE LOHR c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the Microsoft trial on Wednesday, a Justice
Department lawyer opened cross-examination of the company's first
witness by asking him to concede that Microsoft held a monopoly in
personal-computer operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   But although the witness, Richard L. Schmalensee, an economist
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had submitted 328
pages of written testimony addressing every aspect of the
government's antitrust case, he said he had never studied the
market for personal-computer operating systems, because ``I didn't
see any particular purpose in investigating that question.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months after the trial opened, Microsoft finished
questioning the government's final witness, Franklin M. Fisher,
another MIT economist. With that, David Boies, the government's
lead trial lawyer, rested his case _ but not before entering into
evidence a raft of new documents and depositions.
</P>
<P>
   One of those was an internal e-mail in which an executive of the
Walt Disney Co. said, referring to contract restrictions imposed by
Microsoft, ``We are being roughed up by the 1,000-pound gorilla of
the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schmalensee depicted Microsoft on Wednesday as a company
striving to hold onto a fragile lock on the market, at one point
even suggesting that the operating system used in the Palm Pilot
personal organizer posed a serious potential threat to Microsoft's
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted incredulity from Boies, leading Schmalensee to
say: ``Is it a significant competitor today? No. But it is a germ
of a potential competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee has served as a paid consultant and expert witness
for Microsoft since 1992, leading Boies to suggest that he was
Microsoft's ``house economist.'' Boies offered excerpts from
Schmalensee's testimony in a previous case as evidence, attempting
to show that Schmalensee offered whatever position best served the
case at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying last fall in a suit in which Bristol Technology, a
software company based in Danbury, Conn., was trying to establish
that it competed with Microsoft, Schmalensee had said: ``In that
view of the world, essentially everybody that is writing software
is competing with everybody else. And I just don't think that's
useful.''
</P>
<P>
   That apparent contradiction stirred Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson to tell the witness, ``What I'm trying to determine here is
whether what you say here is consistent with what you said in that
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee said it was consistent because the issues were
different. Bristol, he said, made a program for software
programmers that did not compete with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   But Schmalensee listed two small niche operating systems that he
argued posed a threat to Microsoft: Linux and Be-OS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these are important not because they are a competitive
threat today, but because they show that entering the operating
system market is possible,'' he said. ``And there will be others.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge then asked him if the tiny companies that make these
systems were making any money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be stunned if they were making any serious money,''
Schmalensee responded.
</P>
<P>
   In his written testimony, Schmalensee said: ``A firm with
monopoly power over the operating system would charge at least 16
times over what Microsoft charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Under that formula, Microsoft would charge computer makers about
$800 for each copy of Windows _ the price of entire computers
systems with Windows today.
</P>
<P>
   In the final minutes of the government's case, Fisher, who used
to be Schmalensee's teacher, offered a long list of ways he said
Microsoft's behavior had harmed consumers _ a key element of any
antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for computer hardware and software have grown more than
they otherwise would have, he said, and innovation has been
stifled.
</P>
<P>
   With the documents introduced Wednesday, the government tried to
bolster key themes of its case: that Microsoft viewed the Internet
as a threat to its dominance, that it used its operating-system
monopoly to bully personal computer makers and others, and that it
bundled its browser with Windows to stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said the documents had been chosen to embarrass it but
instead depicted a vigorous competitor striving to improve its
products.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail to company executives on Apr. 10, 1995, William
Gates, Microsoft's chairman, wrote, ``We are looking at the
Internet destroying our position as the setter of standards,''
adding that it was ``taking away our power every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The government says Microsoft merged its Internet Explorer
browser with its Windows operating system to assure universal
distribution and thwart competition in Internet software. To
support that charge, the government released a March 1997 e-mail in
which a Microsoft executive wrote that the ``only real chance
Internet Explorer has of getting them to switch'' from Netscape
came when users upgraded a Windows operating system, purchased a
new personal computer loaded with Microsoft's browser or signed up
with an Internet service provider that promoted Internet Explorer.

EDITORIAL: TIME TO BEGIN THE END  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 - TRIAL-NYT   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Jan. 14:
</P>
<P>
   A survey of public-opinion polls on the eve of President
Clinton's trial in the Senate shows that the American people still
have things figured out correctly. Majority opinion is that he
should continue in office, that he should be censured and that he
lied under oath. The Senate's task is to move as expeditiously
toward a verdict that conforms with the public judgment, since that
verdict would also conform with the evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   There are many indications that the Senate majority leader,
Trent Lott, is setting his course with a proper respect for the
law, the traditions of the Senate and the polls, including those
that show that voters will punish the Republicans if they bungle
this trial. Since the trial will develop its own dynamics, it is
difficult to predict exactly how to manage it. But whatever
happens, the senators must insist that the House prosecutors stick
to the case that has been defined through the articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, in particular, must prevent the members from being
diverted by a premature debate on the calling of witnesses. Members
of both parties must resist the temptation of overreacting to White
House briefs that offer what could charitably be called a highly
imaginative rendering of Clinton's testimony about his pitiful
little adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, a key sentence in the trial memorandum
released Wednesday by the White House. ``The President testified
truthfully before the grand jury,'' it said. Not even a White House
that wonders what the meaning of ``is'' is can make that sentence
true, since for the rest of the English-speaking world ``the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth'' still means what it
always has.
</P>
<P>
   Key Democrats, speaking privately, will say they believe Clinton
lied and possibly obstructed justice. According to the CNN/USA
Today poll by Gallup, 79 percent of those surveyed believe Clinton
testified falsely before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   As these somber proceedings begin, the Senate's task is to bring
into governance the active discipline and balanced judgment that
has been missing from the White House. It must reject distorted
Clintonian reality as a matter of intellectual honesty and as a
symbol of Washington's enduring commitment to the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   It must move as quickly as possible through the arguments over
the well-known evidence in this case and turn to developing a
censure resolution that is properly proportioned to Clinton's
offenses. That means allowing him to remain in office but to carry
for all his days a judgment that makes it clear that the American
people do not buy his story, and neither will history.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a time when the mills of justice must grind slowly.
Lott and his fellow senators have before them a mature case
developed through months of investigation and adversarial legal
argument. All that is left is for them to ignore House partisanship
and White House obfuscation and bring this sad episode to a
dignified conclusion. &QL;

UCLA FACES TOUGH WEEKEND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They might not think it, and they certainly won't
admit it, but the UCLA Bruins can call this weekend a success if
they win one game against California and Stanford at Pauley
Pavilion. Such is the wallop carried by the Bay Area travel
partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, this is the toughest tandem of anybody we play,''
Bruins sophomore forward Travis Reed said. ``They're both really,
really good. If we don't play hard and intense, we're in trouble.
We could get blown out.''
</P>
<P>
   The quality of both visitors makes this weekend unique. While
Arizona, Oregon and Washington pack a punch, their travel partners
are traditionally weak. Cal is one of the best teams in the
Pacific-10, and Stanford is one of the best teams in the nation.
There is no guaranteed win for the Bruins. They can absorb one home
loss and finish in the conference's upper division, but they cannot
afford two.
</P>
<P>
   ``This weekend will probably present our most difficult
challenge in terms of back-to-back games,'' Bruins coach Steve
Lavin said. ``Cal beat North Carolina, and Stanford is capable of
winning the national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Extending the premise a week, tonight marks the beginning of a
four-game gauntlet _ Cal, Stanford, at USC, at Louisville _ that
will help shape the Bruins' postseason fate. Two wins and they're
in good health. No wins and suddenly the NIT casts a giant shadow.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the Bruins are better equipped to combat Cal and
Stanford than in recent years. They are bigger and deeper, with
four frontcourt players (Dan Gadzuric, Jerome Moiso, Matt Barnes
and Reed)compared to one (J.R. Henderson) last year. However, Cal
and Stanford have an enormous edge in experience. Both start four
seniors and a junior, while UCLA's most common lineup _ Lavin has
used 12 in 14 games _ features two sophomores and three freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have equated this weekend's task to the challenge
they faced in Puerto Rico in November, when they unexpectedly
played Maryland and Kentucky on consecutive days. After a passive
performance against the Terps, Lavin raged and UCLA responded with
one of its best _ certainly its grittiest _ game of the season in
losing 66-62.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take that same approach this weekend,'' Reed said.
``Both teams can get us if we're not careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Stanford relies on its front-line strength, Cal depends
on its guards, seniors Geno Carlisle and Thomas Kilgore. Combined,
they average 31.1 points and take the majority of Cal's shots in
pressure situations. Kilgore scored 21 against both North Carolina
and Stanford. Carlisle burned the Tar Heels for 29 points, although
his shot selection last weekend frustrated coach Ben Braun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Geno forced the action for us and he didn't need
to,'' Braun said.
</P>
<P>
   The third member of Cal's scoring trio is sophomore forward Sean
Lampley, who played well last month but has struggled recently,
scoring 11 points against Oregon State and five against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has got to be more aggressive,'' Braun said. ``He has got
to get tougher on himself and go work a little harder.''
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of UCLA. Another lethargic performance (see:
American, Arizona State, Oregon State) will mean instant trouble.
The Bruins must play as they did against Arizona and Oregon if they
hope to finish above those teams in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the team knows how big a weekend this is for us,''
Farnham said. ``If we win both, if solidifies us as a Pac-10 title
contender.''

WEST: JORDAN'S TIMING RIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Jerry West watched Michael Jordan's farewell
speech Wednesday morning and saw something disconcerting. Something
even a little familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at him, and to be candid, he looked drained, just
emotionally drained,'' West said. ``This is an awkward day for him
... but in his mind this is going to be a day that when he looks
back at is going to say, `Thank God I walked away from it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   West should know. The Lakers' executive vice president and Hall
of Famer retired as a player under similar circumstances. When West
hung it up in 1973, he was 36 years old and still at the top of his
game. Jordan will be 36 next month.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a key difference in the exits of West and Jordan,
two of the game's brightest stars of their eras.
</P>
<P>
   When West retired, he did so during the exhibition season,
bitter with owner Jack Kent Cooke over issues of trust and to a
degree, compensation. Physically, he figured he had two good
seasons left, but mentally he no longer had the drive _ ``I felt no
excitement sitting in the locker room,'' he has said.
</P>
<P>
   West left on his own terms, but under adverse conditions. He
declines to revisit the event, saying ``I don't like to talk about
myself. It was far from perfect, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan had his own burdens, West said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a player that, at least from maybe the public's
perception, he was carrying the NBA. And pretty soon he's asked to
be the greatest player in the league and asked to carry his team
like no other player has ever done. The weight of the world is on
your shoulders,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when I said I retired, it felt like the weight of the
world was off my shoulders,'' he said. ``I got out from under a
burden that was crushing me. I hope (Jordan) feels the same about
walking away.''
</P>
<P>
   While so many other superstars try to prolong their careers past
their primes, Jordan leaves on top. Last season, he took the Bulls
to their sixth title in eight years, and Jordan clinched it in
storybook fashion, hitting the game-winning jumper in the decisive
Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to go out the way he did,'' West said. ``He went out
at the very highest peak of his career, with the very greatest
respect of maybe any athlete I've ever seen. That's the way I think
anyone who has given as much to a particular team or franchise
would like to go out. It's not reserved for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my perspective, I'm happy for him,'' West said. ``I know
how hard those decisions are to make.''

EDITORIAL: OF FAIRNESS AND FEDERALISM 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ga.)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Jan. 14:
</P>
<P>
   A pair of provocative cases before the Supreme Court this week,
one on sexual harassment and one on welfare benefits, raise very
different legal issues. Yet the challenge for the justices in both
cases is the same _ to act firmly against discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In the first case, the court heard oral arguments on whether
Title IX, the law that bars sex discrimination by schools that
receive federal money, requires that schools take reasonable steps
to stop sexual harassment by one student against another.
</P>
<P>
   That question was raised by the ordeal of LaShonda Davis, a
fifth-grade girl in Georgia who was subjected to months of unwanted
poking, grabbing and sexual taunting by a male classmate. Her
mother's complaints to school authorities proved unavailing. Yet a
lower appellate court tossed out her harassment lawsuit, finding
that Title IX does not cover student-on-student harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Reversing that unjust decision should be a relatively easy call
in light of the plain language of the statute and the court's
analogous decision in June holding schools liable for damages when
they know of sexual harassment of a student by a teacher and
respond with deliberate indifference. The fact that the harasser in
this case was another student should not change the school's
culpability. Some justices expressed concern about a deluge of
frivolous lawsuits. But to be actionable, the offending behavior
would have to be sufficiently egregious to effectively deny an
educational opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, the court turned Wednesday to the terms of
welfare reform. California, like a number of states, has decided to
hold new residents, for the first year, to the level of benefits
available in their home states _ typically an inadequate amount for
subsistence in California.
</P>
<P>
   In an important 1969 case, Shapiro vs. Thompson, the court ruled
that it violated the constitutional right to travel to deny all
welfare benefits to newcomers. But defenders of California's scheme
say it does not ``penalize'' newcomers since it only holds them to
the amount of benefits in their old state. They also cite Congress'
expressed desire to allow states leeway in this area.
</P>
<P>
   But these are not acceptable excuses for tampering with the
structure of federalism and the constitutional principle Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg aptly termed the ``genius of the United
States.'' Americans have a right to settle in any state they choose
without being treated as second-class citizens.

EDITORIAL: FOR SALE: THE GARDEN OF EDEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Jan. 14:
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Winter is not such a good time to show a community garden. It
can easily look like a field of dirt, suitable for sale to anybody
who wants to buy it and is willing to pay New York City's taxes.
That may be why Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his administration have
launched plans to sell more than 118 lots including a number of
neighborhood gardens, all now empty of the noisy eco-protesters who
would certainly be there in high summer.
</P>
<P>
   The city has about 11,000 vacant or abandoned lots in all five
boroughs. Some are oddly shaped, unsuited for communal space; some
are genuinely vacant; others are trash heaps and eyesores. About
700 sites are considered gardens by their communities, a loose
definition that could mean anything from a few rows of rangy
marigolds to the Garden of Eden in the South Jamaica neighborhood
of Queens. Eden, featured three years ago in National Geographic,
is a 25-by-83-foot lot that two elderly residents helped convert
from a neighborhood junkyard to a busy outdoor community center.
</P>
<P>
   For some time now, these city gardens have come with a caveat.
They were on loan from the city with the understanding that the
land might be used for low-income housing. Last spring the city
shifted control of most gardens to its housing department as a
first step toward this conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, in a process that has been abysmally secretive
even by this administration's standards, most of these plots have
shifted again to an agency that can put them up for sale to the
highest bidder. Because they already have been through the land
review process, these parcels can now be sold for any use within
the zoning laws.
</P>
<P>
   Civic leaders, from Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer to
various community boards, are understandably alarmed by the
possibility of wholesale auctioning of open spaces in this densely
populated city. Too often these auctions have resulted in nothing
better than a paved parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The city should re-examine the lots, parcel by parcel, looking
at the need for open space and possibly running some gardens as
community projects. A proposal by the Trust for Public Land to
convert the true gardens into private land trusts is worth
exploring. Selling off the surplus lots may be fiscally prudent for
City Hall, but bulldozing a working garden is an act of
neighborhood violence.

AOL AND BELL ATLANTIC PLAN TO JOINTLY MARKET HIGH-SPEED INTERNET
ACCESS 
 (DW) 
</HEADLINE>
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move to compete with high-speed cable-modem services,
America Online and Bell Atlantic Wednesday announced a joint
marketing effort to sell high-speed Internet access to America
Online's customers.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance marks a significant step in America Online's effort
to retain its leadership as a ``portal,'' or entry point, to the
Internet in a market increasingly moving toward high-speed Internet
access. The cable-modem business currently has only about 500,000
customers nationwide but is expected to more than double this year.
</P>
<P>
   That presents a threat to local telephone companies and to
portals, which make their money primarily by selling advertising on
sites that millions of Internet users pass through daily. Of the
top portals _ which include Yahoo, NetCenter and Go _ America
Online, with 15 million members, is the largest.
</P>
<P>
   The cable modem business is dominated by At Home and Roadrunner,
which are portals as well as technologies for accessing the
Internet over TV cables. While America Online and other portals can
be used over cable modems, they are not users' first stop in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, local phone companies are eager to compete
with cable companies by offering asymmetrical digital subscriber
line, or ADSL, technology over existing phone lines. ADSL service
does not require customers to dial in, and connection speeds are
about 20 times faster than standard modems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal is part of our plan to beat cable modems,'' said Amy
McIntosh, president of consumer data services for Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   America Online said many of its members in Bell Atlantic's East
Coast territory would be able to purchase the service this summer
for an extra $20 a month, bringing the total cost to $40 a month.
That is in line with the $40 a month charged by cable modem
services but about $20 less than Bell Atlantic charges for full
Internet service over ADSL.
</P>
<P>
   America Online members who have cable modems pay $10 a month,
about half the fees charged dial-up members.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's president, Robert W. Pittman, said: ``Some of
our customers are interested in speed, and we want to provide it
for them in a package that makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic said that close to 7.5 million customers would be
able to get ADSL by the end of 1999.

first to their Internet service provider, not the local cable

HEARTBROKEN ROCKER SPEAKS OUT AGAINST HEROIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file)  
 By NEVA CHONIN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sitting in his South of Market recording studio,
veteran rocker Boz Scaggs occasionally pauses to wipe tears from
his eyes as he talks about his son, Oscar. ``This is a parent's
worst nightmare. It's as though there were an explosion and
everything was blown to smithereens. There is nothing left of the
world as I knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scaggs' voice is calm, but his face is drawn and haggard. On New
Year's Eve, Oscar, 21, died of a heroin overdose in the decrepit
Hotel Royan, in San Francisco's Mission District.
</P>
<P>
   In an exclusive interview, Scaggs, 54, broke his silence for the
first time since Oscar's death to convey a father's feelings of
loss, frustration and anger. He also wants to use his celebrity to
warn about what he calls ``the plague of heroin threatening San
Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Being the son of a famous rock musician was no insulation
against heroin abuse for Oscar Scaggs, his father says.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went to some of the better schools in some of the better
neighborhoods, so in that way he was privileged,'' Scaggs concedes.
``But he was a San Francisco kid. He lived his life all over this
town. He hung out in the park, he was a skateboarder, he played
(Police Activities League) baseball and basketball. It would be a
mistake to view Oscar as a kid who grew up spoiled and wayward
because he didn't have grounded values.''
</P>
<P>
   Boz and Carmella Scaggs were married in 1971. They divorced in
1980 and were awarded joint custody of their children. Oscar and
his younger brother, Austin, split their time between their
parents' San Francisco homes.
</P>
<P>
   Though stable, the Scaggses' lives as part of the city's music
and nightclub scene were a far cry from the squeaky-clean American
ideal. And there were strains in the family's life. Though popular,
Oscar never excelled in school. At an early age, he was diagnosed
with attention deficit disorder, and he often had trouble reading
and processing oral information. He changed schools several times
and never found his niche _ but neither, his mother said Tuesday in
a telephone interview, did he ever give up.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his own experience with drugs might have affected his
ability to raise his children, Scaggs responds that his only drug
since 1967 has been alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the most successful point of my career, I could have been
termed an alcoholic because I used hard liquor every day, and at
times it took control over me,'' he acknowledges. ``And Carmella
and I were among a generation of people who used drugs and alcohol
socially. That was in the '60s. It was part of the culture. As far
as its being around in the presence of the boys, I would say
emphatically no. There was no exposure on their part to any abuses
at all on my part or Carmella's.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the reports of Oscar Scaggs' death have focused on his
famous father, Carmella Scaggs is suffering a mother's grief _ and
anger as well. In a hushed, shaking voice, she called heroin abuse
``an epidemic that could happen to any mother's kid. When I was
Oscar's age, it was the ultimate _ something you only read about.
Nowadays, kids are sniffing it as easily as they're smoking
marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   That heroin is no longer ``the ultimate'' is one of the reasons
for increased overdoses among young people today, says Millicent
Buxton, a counselor at the Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic who tried to
help Oscar Scaggs.
</P>
<P>
   It's seldom the hard-core addicts who die by overdose, but
rather sporadic users and those trying to kick the habit whose
lower resistance to the opiate pushes them into respiratory arrest.
Oscar, who never used enough to suffer from physical withdrawal,
belonged to the latter category, his father says.
</P>
<P>
   How did Oscar discover heroin? His father doesn't know. His
mother, with whom Oscar was living at the time, initially sounded
the alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Recalls Carmella Scaggs quietly, ``Oscar came to me in January
of '98 and told me that he had tried heroin and was afraid he would
have a problem with it. I was shocked. The next day we talked to
Millicent Buxton, whom Oscar had been seeing since he was caught
smoking marijuana in school. He was willing to do anything he could
to get away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Oscar entered a program in Montana called
Wilderness Treatment, where his mother and brother spent a week
with him as part of his two months of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Oscar spent time in a Louisiana drug treatment
program, then asked to come back to San Francisco, where for three
months he continued his treatment at the Sequoia Alcohol and Drug
Rehabilitation Center on the Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar emerged from his months of treatment, his father says,
``an alert, vital young man who was beginning to put together a
reality of himself that he was pleased with and proud of. He was
beginning to see a world that he could manage. But success is
measured a day at a time. To get through a week is immense; to get
through a month _ I've got a coin in my pocket that he gave me
commemorating his first two months. It was a big celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were relapses, too, four to six during the course of
the year. ``Oscar was working hard,'' his mother says. ``But there
was always that urge, that tremendous call to try it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, by the time autumn rolled around, the Scaggses were
feeling that everything was going to be OK. Oscar seemed strong. He
had a new girlfriend and a great job. Life was good.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the unmistakable signs of another relapse.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   His father remembers the last time he saw Oscar, two days before
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in a bad mood, tired and depressed,'' Scaggs recalls,
tears welling up in his eyes. ``All he wanted to do was lay on the
couch and watch television. He said he just wanted to go to sleep
because he had to work early the next morning. We later realized
that he had been out all the night before using heroin and had
probably had some earlier in the day.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Austin called to tell his father that Oscar was
dead.
</P>
<P>
   In the shell-shocked aftermath of Oscar's death, Scaggs says he
has resolved to use his celebrity to warn kids and parents about
the heroin epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``These dealers are selling death,'' Scaggs says, his eyes
flashing with anger and grief. ``Kids need to be given the means to
defend themselves. They've got to know that they're under attack so
they can take care of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The huge tragedy has carried a small silver lining: Boz and
Carmella Scaggs have made peace after years of estrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carmella has been very supportive and helpful to me, and I've
tried to support her in every way I can,'' Scaggs says. ``No mother
could have loved her sons more. No mother could have given them the
unqualified support that she did. She gave them her entire love.''
</P>
<P>
   The Monday before he died, Oscar and Carmella won a trivia
contest at a bar in the North Beach neighborhood. The weekly
contest was one of their favorite shared activities, and Oscar was
elated by the victory. ``He felt great. The day that he died, he
left the house smiling and happy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always remember watching him walking out the door,
looking like a million dollars. `I love you, Mom,' he said. `I'll
see you later.' We'll never really know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   She pauses, the words catching in her throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Monday after he died, we went back to win the trivia
contest for him a second time. We're going again tonight, me and
about 10 of his friends. And next Monday, too.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything positive comes out of his family's loss, Boz Scaggs
says, it will be the opportunity to reach out to other kids with
addiction problems.
</P>
<P>
   It's the most fitting memorial he can think of for a young man
who was always looking out for his friends. He was the kind of guy
who'd spend his lunch break from his job at a clothing store
helping out a stranger with a stalled car, his friends remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar was quite a rich little character, quite a piece of
work,'' Scaggs whispers sadly. ``He was unique. As we all are.''

BLACK AUTO DEALER COULD BE TEST CASE FOR INCLUSION 
 (DW) 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mich., Ohio, Texas)  By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson opens up the Wall Street Project
conference on minorities and investment Thursday, one of the
central players is expected to be Mel Farr, who heads the nation's
largest black-owned auto dealership.
</P>
<P>
   Farr, who operates dealerships in Michigan, Ohio and Texas, has
been held up by Jackson as one of the nation's leading minority
entrepreneurs, a prime candidate for Wall Street to look to if it
is going to invest in minority businesses and neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street has not yet embraced Farr's effort to raise $45
million in a private placement of asset-backed securities to expand
his dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything concrete yet,'' said Farr, who plans to
meet this week with officials at Citigroup and Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
``This is a test. We want inclusion. I've got a portfolio of
investment grade, and now I want to see if they're going to invest
in an African-American business that does business in the
African-American community.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Farr, 54, might be seen as an early test case for
the Wall Street Project, which Jackson and Farr, who are longtime
friends, say is all about investing in the ``emerging markets of
urban areas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes to Wall Street looking for access to capital,''
Jackson said last night. ``And we're going to work hard for him.''
Of Wall Street, he added: ``They can't say they can't find a guy.
They have a guy. He comes to the plate with all the qualities.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few decades, Farr, a former pro football player,
says he has turned a bunch of failing dealerships in the Detroit
area into a business with more than $600 million in revenue. He
built his business selling and leasing cars in poor neighborhoods,
to minorities with little or no credit, often at high interest
rates. He says that for many it is their only way to get
transportation for some jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Although he caters primarily to minorities, he also has
dealerships in largely white neighborhoods. His sales are often
bolstered by television ads aimed at blacks that feature
``Superstar Mel Farr'' with Farr in a suit and a red cape.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, there were also television ads that spotlighted
a white actor in commercials done for a dealership in Fairfield,
Ohio, which Farr says illustrates how difficult it is to cross over
in some areas. ``It's a market that is primarily white Americans,
and I didn't want to turn off those customers because I am black,''
he said.

HEARTBROKEN ROCKER SPEAKS OUT AGAINST HEROIN

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sitting in his South of Market recording studio,
veteran rocker Boz Scaggs occasionally pauses to wipe tears from
his eyes as he talks about his son, Oscar. ``This is a parent's
worst nightmare. It's as though there were an explosion and
everything was blown to smithereens. There is nothing left of the
world as I knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scaggs' voice is calm, but his face is drawn and haggard. On New

   In an exclusive interview, Scaggs, 54, broke his silence for the

   Boz and Carmella Scaggs were married in 1971. They divorced in

his younger brother, Austin, split their time between their
parents' San Francisco homes.
</P>
<P>
   Though stable, the Scaggses' lives as part of the city's music

ADVANCED MICRO PROFIT FAILS   TO MEET ANALYSTS' ESTIMATES 
 (DW) 
</HEADLINE>
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Advanced Micro Devices &UR;  &LR; Inc. reported
fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday that fell a few cents short of
analysts' estimates. It was the company's second consecutive
profitable quarter after it reported losses in the first half of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth quarter, Advanced Micro reported earnings of
$22.3 million, or 15 cents a diluted share, compared with a loss of
$12.3 million in the quarter a year earlier. The company was
expected to earn 19 cents a share, the average estimate of analysts
polled by the First Call Corp., which tracks company earnings.
Revenue rose 29 percent, to $788.8 million from $613.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Advanced Micro reported a loss of $104 million,
compared with a loss of $21.1 million in 1997. Revenue rose 8
percent, to $2.54 billion from $2.36 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro attributed the earnings shortfall to
manufacturing problems that prevented it from shipping more of its
fastest chips, 400- megahertz processors, which command higher
profit margins. The company has had this kind of slip-up before
with new chips. But the disappointment was all the more acute
coming in a quarter where strong results at disparate companies
such as the Intel Corp. and Apple Computer &UR;  &LR; Inc. made it clear that
demand for personal computers and microprocessors is surging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the problem behind us now,'' W.J. Sanders III, the
chairman and chief executive of Advanced Micro, said in a telephone
conference call with securities analysts. ``We shipped hundreds of
thousands of 400-megahertz processors but were unable to satisfy
strong overall market demand,'' he said. ``We expect to
substantially increase shipments of 400-megahertz processors in the
current quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro reported its results after the market closed. Its
shares fell $3.75, to $27.75, Wednesday on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a keen disappointment,'' said Mark Edelstone, an
analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``The company delivered
the unit volume we expected, but they once again had some
manufacturing execution issues that prevented them from delivering
the earnings.'' &QL;

STORY THAT ONE MISTRESS SHOT THE OTHER `LUDICROUS,' PROSECUTOR
SAYS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del.)   (rk) 
 By   WILLIAM GLABERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ In his summation at the murder trial of a
wealthy and influential Wilmington lawyer, a prosecutor urged
jurors Wednesday to dismiss as absurd the defendant's story that
one of his mistresses accidentally shot another.
</P>
<P>
   ``That story is ludicrous,'' the prosecutor, Colm F. Connolly,
told the jurors in his final remarks before they begin
deliberations. ``That story defies common sense. It is not
credible.''
</P>
<P>
   But the chief defense lawyer countered that jurors should not
convict the lawyer, Thomas J. Capano, just because he had admitted
a series of ``things that may offend you,'' such as adultery, lying
to investigators, pornography or dumping the body of his former
lover into the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't vote guilty,'' said the defense lawyer, Joseph S.
Oteri, ``because you don't like Tom Capano and what he did.'' One
thing Capano did not do, Oteri said, was kill his mistress, Anne
Marie Fahey, the 30-year old appointments secretary to Gov. Thomas
Carper of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which has lent a tinge of soap opera to Delaware's
elite, has focused in recent weeks on Capano's version of events.
In a rare and risky defense move, Capano took the stand to make his
own case. He admitted that he had thrown the body of Fahey into the
Atlantic in a large cooler. But he denied murdering her in June
1996. Prosecutors said he killed her because there was a new man in
her life.
</P>
<P>
   Capano, the scion of one of Delaware's wealthiest real-estate
families, blamed another mistress, Deborah A. MacIntyre. He said
she burst in on Fahey and him with a drawn pistol and incoherent
talk of suicide. ``Debby shot Anne Marie'' accidentally when he
grabbed her arm, he testified last month. Then, he said, he
panicked and began elaborate preparations to dispose of the body,
which has never been found.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly reminded the jurors Wednesday that Capano, who was
separated from his wife at the time of Fahey's death, had said for
more than two years that he knew nothing of Fahey's disappearance.
Only when the trial began this fall did Capano say for the first
time that Fahey had died as a result of what his lawyer called ``an
outrageous, horrible, tragic accident.''
</P>
<P>
   In a courtroom that was steamy from heat and more than 200
people, Connolly dwelled on what the prosecutors say were the
telltale signs of Capano's plot to have Fahey for himself, or be
sure that no one else did.
</P>
<P>
   Some witnesses have described the victim as an energetic beauty.
But there was also testimony that she was insecure and struggled
with anorexia. Connolly, a federal prosecutor who has worked with
Delaware prosecutors on the case in state Superior Court here, led
the jurors through the prosecution's version of what he called the
49-year-old Capano's manipulation of Fahey: gifts, scores of
telephone calls, e-mail messages and unexpected visits.
</P>
<P>
   But then, as Fahey's relationship with a younger man blossomed,
Connolly said, Capano needed to try to keep control. He acquired a
gun and a large picnic cooler, a long chain and a heavy lock for
disposal of the corpse.
</P>
<P>
   With relentless detail, in a closing statement that began at 9
a.m. and lasted until well after lunch, Connolly described Capano
as someone who felt he did not have to live by the rules. He asked
why Capano had delayed so long in admitting that he knew what had
happened to Fahey as her family and investigators grew frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer,'' Connolly said, ``is because the defendant
thought he would get away with murder.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Oteri, a renown defense lawyer from Boston, had
the harder task Wednesday. By testifying, Capano opened himself to
detailed questions about such events as an abortive plan by Capano
to have someone burglarize MacIntyre's home while he was in jail
and she was beginning to consider cooperating with the prosecutors
as a witness against him.
</P>
<P>
   Oteri seemed to take to the challenge before him with verve. He
called Capano ``Tommy'' and exuberantly reminded the jurors of the
virtues of the American justice system's requirement that no one
can be found guilty unless there is evidence beyond a reasonable
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   He portrayed Capano as a caring friend of Fahey and not the
stalker described by prosecutors. But he argued that his client was
something of a bumbler.
</P>
<P>
   Such missteps as the would-be burglary, which prosecutors have
suggested was an effort to intimidate a potential witness, were,
Oteri said, all evidence that Capano was simply a man valiantly
trying to protect MacIntyre, the ostensible real shooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the stupid things that happened,'' Oteri mused. ``All of
which are consistent with this being caused by Debby MacIntyre and
him reacting badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most difficult hurdle for the defense has been the
testimony of one of Capano's brothers, Gerard, who told the court
that he helped dispose of Fahey's body. Gerard Capano also
acknowledged drug and alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony against Capano, Oteri said, was just ``the ravings
of Gerry's drug-addled mind.''

JETS' DEFENSE WILL TRY TO CHANGE DAVIS' SCRIPT 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The best running back the Jets _ ``or anyone
else,'' according to Coach Bill Parcells _ have faced this season
loomed on the projection screen here for the defense Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' Terrell Davis did his 2,000-yard thing via the
magic of videotape. Curtis Martin, Davis' counterpart for the Jets,
did not need to see films of his good friend. Martin knows what his
teammates must do to halt Davis on Sunday in the American Football
Conference championship at Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let him run you over,'' Martin said simply.
</P>
<P>
   Davis ran over about everyone this season in becoming the fourth
runner in National Football League history to generate 2,000 yards.
He amassed 2,008, averaging 5.1 yards a carry, and scored 21
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   So, perhaps it was not surprising that the way the Jets
described Davis, he was a running back without weaknesses, an
athlete who compensates for his mistakes while taking advantage of
the defense's errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some running backs, they just go out there and
run,'' defensive end Rick Lyle said. ``But he has good techniques
for avoiding tackles. He keeps his knees high. He has a great body
lean.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of Davis, the Broncos have been able to dispose
of many opponents by the end of the first quarter. Denver outscores
its opposition by _ and this is no misprint _ 47 points to 9 on the
opening drive. By the end of the opening quarter, the differential
is 144-55. No wonder the Broncos won their first 13 games en route
to a 14-2 regular-season record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We script the first 15 plays and we'll stick with that unless
the defense throws something different at us; so our players are
accustomed to it,'' Broncos Coach Mike Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, they will stick with Davis. He helped lead the
Broncos to the Super Bowl title a year ago, and now, after 17
games, he seems refreshed. He galloped for 199 yards in the
Broncos' playoff victory over Miami last Saturday. He says he was
helped by the bye week, and now he gets an extra day between games.
</P>
<P>
   ``What separates Terrell from the others is he's got the
complete package of all the backs I've ever been around,'' Shanahan
said. ``He's got power. He's got the ability to make people miss.
He's got the ability to make the big play.''
</P>
<P>
   That means the burden on quarterback John Elway to always make
the big play has eased. Despite Elway's long record of success and
Super Bowl appearances, Davis is the first Pro Bowl runner to share
his backfield. Having Davis _ as well as tight end Shannon Sharpe
and the Bronco wide receivers, Rod Smith and Ed McCaffrey _ means
Elway does not have to be the triple-threat player he once was.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious thing about Denver is their strong running
attack,'' Parcells said. ``Better than 150 yards per game _ and the
explosiveness with which they start their games.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Davis, Parcells said: ``I would have to put him in the
category of great backs I've played against. They can do things to
put teams in a hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis had an outstanding game the last time he faced a Parcells
team with a Bill Belichick defense. That was against the Patriots
in 1996, when Davis rushed for 154 yards and 2 touchdowns on a
season-high 32 carries. He also scored on a catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game got out of hand early,'' Parcells said, dismissing
any significance. But Davis said of that game, and Belichick in
particular, ``You make yourself more experienced with what he's
going to bring to the table, and that helps us.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it will. But no running back has gained 100 yards
against the Jets in 11 games. The last one was the Patriots' Robert
Edwards in Game 6, in a losing effort. Only one other runner
reached the 100-yard figure against the Jets. That was the 49ers'
Garrison Hearst, and it took his 96-yard run in overtime to crack
the barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells is concerned about Davis' ability to keep drives
moving, and then score from the red zone _ the Broncos have
produced touchdowns almost two-thirds of the time they get to the
20-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their running game,'' Parcells said, ``is not a complex
running game. It's a simple game, but they do a lot of repetitions.
Davis makes his linemen look good. Our secondary will have to be
ready or we're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The linebackers will have to slow Davis. ``I have to be aware to
turn him inside,'' the right-side linebacker Chad Cascadden said.
``He's kind of like Fred Taylor last week with Jacksonville, only
better. He's got a great stiff arm and he breaks tackles. It's a
question of hanging on to him. You look at the tapes and you see a
defender hanging on, and then the defender falls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best,'' backup safety Chris Hayes said. ``I've never
seen a guy hit the hole like that. We've got to bring it on this
week because this dude's everything wrapped up in one.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Green, the Jets' safety and leading tackler, talked ``of
bringing everything I've got, because if you arm-tackle this guy,
he'll get away from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was asked whether Davis' vision was why he ran so well.
``I've got good vision,'' the coach said, ``but I can't run like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINT
</P>
<P>
   Winston Hill, who played with the Jets from 1963-76, will be the
team's honorary captain Sunday. Hill, who owns two barbeque
restaurants in the Denver area, told a Jets official, ``You've made
my dreams come true.''  &QL;

A BIG PLAY IN DENVER FOR MEGGETT AND COACH
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: See also JETS-DAVIS) (DW) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ With the American Football Conference
championship game in Denver just four days away, Jets Coach Bill
Parcells and his longtime favorite kick returner, David Meggett,
both remembered the same thing about Parcells' last _ and only _
visit as a head coach to Mile High Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was snowing,'' Parcells recalled at the Jets' camp
Wednesday, telling of a game played in Meggett's rookie season of
1989.
</P>
<P>
   It snowed eight inches on that December day in Denver. That was
what Meggett said he remembered most, too.
</P>
<P>
   With a little prodding, Meggett, a 10-year veteran who signed
with the Jets on Dec. 15, remembered something else about the first
of the two games he has ever played at Mile High, a 14-7 Giants
victory over the Broncos. For it was Meggett's 57-yard touchdown
off a screen pass from Phil Simms _ a pass that Meggett initially
had juggled before he scampered through the snow _ that gave the
Giants a two-touchdown lead and put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember all my touchdowns,'' Meggett said. ``There have
been only two or three of them in the league since I've been
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meggett actually has scored 11 touchdowns receiving, 8 rushing,
6 on punt returns and 1 on a kickoff return during a career in
which he has established himself as the National Football League's
career-leading punt returner. But this touchdown was special.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was third and like a mile, or something like that,''
Meggett said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   It was third-and-31, after the Giants had lost yards on
consecutive downs following a 26-yard Meggett punt return.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday's forecast does not include snow. But both Meggett
and Parcells hope that Meggett, who has reached a Super Bowl and a
Pro Bowl with both the Giants and the New England Patriots, has one
more big play in him resembling that Denver touchdown in his rookie
season. Especially because Meggett _ who is the only player to play
for Parcells with the Giants, the Patriots and now the Jets _ has
never scored a touchdown in 12 career post-season games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about plays like that all the time,'' Meggett said.
``A play that can change the complexion of a game. Big players make
big plays in big games. And that's what I want to be known as: a
big-time player.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he is only 5 feet 7 inches and 195 pounds, Meggett
has always had a reputation as a player who can break a game open
with one big run, catch or return.
</P>
<P>
   But last fall, Meggett was spending his time as a student at
Towson State in Maryland, working on his undergraduate degree in
sports administration.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was coming off April foot surgery, an off-season
arrest on charges of theft and assault in Toronto (a misdemeanor
theft charge is still pending) and an acrimonious salary dispute
with the Patriots _ all of which led to Meggett's departure from
New England _ Meggett said that he was prepared to not play at all
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he hit the schoolbooks, not the playbooks. In his first
go-through at Towson State, Meggett said all he cared about was
playing football, not how well he was doing in class. Now, Meggett
said, he had disciplined himself through the countless hours he had
spent in the NFL studying film, going to practice and learning to
be on time, and he became a straight-A student in three classes
last semester (with two class finals pending). He is 27 credits
short of a degree.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Meggett kept in contact with Parcells, as Meggett
said he had always done. Parcells would ask Meggett about his
weight; Meggett would ask Parcells about his.
</P>
<P>
   Meggett's foot began to feel better, and in mid-December, the
Jets lost Leon Johnson for the season because of a broken rib. Out
went the call for Meggett, who played in the Jets' final two
regular-season games against Buffalo and New England and then
returned all the punts and kickoffs in last Sunday's 34-24 playoff
victory over Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really only had one real good opportunity,'' Parcells
said. ``And he almost ran that for a touchdown. That was against
New England. He had 10 guys behind him. On Sunday, he only had a
chance to return one punt. So, I think he'll be OK''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday against the Broncos, Meggett will again be the Jets'
primary returner, as well as a third-down back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not amazed because he's a very smart player,'' Parcells
said. ``He knew the pass protections better than the quarterbacks
when he was playing for the Giants.''  &QL;

AD COLUMN: STUDY FINDS DISCRIMINATION IN RADIO ADS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., N.Y.)   (nk) 
 BY STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A manager in New York for three FM radio stations _
one aimed at a black audience, the others at broader general
audiences _ reports that upscale car companies like Volvo and BMW
refuse to buy advertisements on the black station, even when shown
market surveys indicating that the black audience is more
interested in buying such cars.
</P>
<P>
   At a different company, which represents broadcasters selling
air time to advertisers, an executive writes a training memo
contending that ``the nonethnic consumer is more attractive'' and
recommending that clients be steered toward radio stations with
broader-based audiences because ``advertisers should want prospects
not suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Washington, of the three leading radio stations, all with
similar ratings and audience demographics, the one owned by CBS
Corp. reported more revenues than the combined total of the other
two _ one run by Howard University and the other by Radio One Inc.,
one of the country's largest minority broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   These accounts of disparities and discrimination in radio
advertising were detailed Wednesday in a report by the Federal
Communications Commission. The year-and-a-half-long review, which
included a survey of 3,745 stations based on 1996 data, is the
first government study on the subject. It concludes that radio
stations aimed primarily at black and Hispanic audiences receive
significantly less ad revenue per listener and have also been
forced to offer deeper discounts than their mainstream
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report's findings are bleak and shameful,'' said Rep.
Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, D-Mich., who has studied the issue.
``But they come as no surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-one percent of the minority broadcasters surveyed
encountered what are known in the industry's jargon as ``dictates''
not to buy commercials on their radio stations. On average, each of
them encountered 26 such dictates annually.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which highlighted practices that many minority
broadcasters and advertising agencies have complained about for
years, cautioned that racial discrimination might not be the only
reason for their lagging revenues. Revenues may also be affected by
demographics and ratings, and companies owning more stations often
have significantly bigger buying power.
</P>
<P>
   But while there were calls Wednesday for changes in advertising
practices, officials acknowledged that there was little legal
action that could be taken to force companies to comply. The FCC
has recently had few successes in the courts or in Congress on a
variety of civil rights-related claims. Last April, in a major
defeat, a federal appeals court here struck down a government
requirement that radio and television stations seek minority
applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the agency does not technically have jurisdiction over
advertising issues, and it is not clear whether other government
agencies have any stronger authority.
</P>
<P>
   A number of minority-run advertising companies and broadcasters
have suggested that the White House consider issuing an executive
order that would impose possible sanctions on any advertisers that
discriminate and are also government contractors.
</P>
<P>
   At a forum held Wednesday at the FCC to discuss the report,
Judith Ellis, a senior vice president and manager of three FM
stations in New York _ WRKS, WQHT and WQCD _ for Emmis
Broadcasting, said she could give dozens of examples in which
advertisers refused to buy air time on WRKS, which programs adult
contemporary music aimed at black audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ellis, whose examples were cited in the report, said that
representatives of both BMW and the New York Volvo Dealers
Association had refused to place ads on WRKS, even though marketing
information clearly showed that listeners of the station closely
matched the profile of the auto companies' typical customers.
</P>
<P>
   Martha McKinley, a spokeswoman in the United States for BMW
A.G., said she could not speak about the incident reported by Ms.
Ellis. ``We don't purchase a lot of radio,'' Ms. McKinley said.
``Print is a significant portion of our advertising media mix, and
we do buy in African-American and other minority publications.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Austin, director of marketing communications for Volvo
Cars of North America, said he had not seen the report and that he
had little control over the advertising decisions of a dealers
association. But he also emphasized that the company's media
decisions were controlled by things like affluence, household
income levels and education levels and had nothing to do with
racial issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reach successful people through Forbes and Fortune,'' he
said. ``Successful black businessmen and women read those
magazines. Successful Asian businessmen and women read those
magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was supported by the American Advertising Federation
in Washington, which is composed of media companies, advertising
agencies and marketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC report is a blessing in disguise if it helps us to
accelerate the pace of progress,'' said Wally Snyder, president and
chief executive of the federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report shows there are problems we need to overcome in the
way advertising is bought and sold,'' he added. The federation will
appoint a task force, Snyder said, to examine ways to promote what
he termed equity in media buying and selling, including the
feasibility of a voluntary code of conduct. The study is also to be
discussed at a conference on multicultural marketing and media; the
conference, to be held on Monday in Manhattan, was scheduled before
the study's release.

GAME AGAINST JETS MAY BE ELWAY'S LAST  
(RK)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENGLEWOOD, Colo. _ He is old _ six months shy of his 39th
birthday _ and tired, too. More than 250 games in the National
Football League over 16 seasons means thousands of hits and months
of hurt. But John Elway got healed and got younger last year when
he drank from a career-affirming fountain.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego. At Super Bowl XXXII.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Broncos' 31-24 victory over the Green Bay Packers
last year brought Elway his first Super Bowl championship. It
bought him another year. He remembers sitting in his hotel room
after the game, his mind racing over a record-setting career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would anybody have a tough time getting motivated to come
back and win another one when winning a Super Bowl feels this
good?'' he remembered thinking. ``It's still a fresh memory for me.
I'd love to feel it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe just once more. Or maybe not. On the day Michael Jordan
officially announced he was satisfied with the living highlight
reel he would leave behind, Elway clutched his retirement cards
close to his flak jacket and insisted that Sunday's American
Conference championship game against the Jets was bigger than what
he may or may not do next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to even let that enter my mind, what I'm doing
next year,'' Elway said. ``I'm just going to try to enjoy what I
came back for, these situations. I'm going to enjoy it now and
cross that bridge when the season's over.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a sense in the Broncos locker room and throughout
this city that Sunday will be the last time Elway takes a snap in
Mile High Stadium. That, in essence, the Jets will determine
whether Elway has 60 more minutes of football left in his glorious
career or whether he will take the Super Bowl stage for a fifth and
final time _ something no other National Football League
quarterback has done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think John would rather go out with one more year left than
stay and maybe find out that he should have left,'' Bronco tight
end Shannon Sharpe said.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Terrell Davis, who ran for 2,008 yards and his
first NFL rushing title, tried to sound philosophical about an
Elway-less Bronco team. ``All good things have to come to an end at
some point in time,'' he said. ``I'm just blessed I had the
opportunity to play with John for four years. If this is his last
game, let's hope it ends on a positive note.'' Then he added,
``We'll try to talk him out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos guide needs 25 pages to layout the accomplishments
of Elway's career. The highlights? He ranks second only to Dan
Marino in passing yards (51,475), attempts (7,250), completions
(4,123) and total offense (54,882).
</P>
<P>
   He has a record 46 fourth-quarter or overtime game-winning
drives, and six of them were engineered in the postseason. Elway is
the NFL's winningest quarterback with a 148-82-1 regular-season
record for a .643 winning percentage. He also is 12-7 in the
postseason and an astounding 4-1 in the AFC championship game.
</P>
<P>
   But it's an uncharacteristic poor statistic that makes Elway and
the Broncos especially dangerous heading into the Jets game: his
1-3 record in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's victory, in Elway's thinking, erases the three
losses. ``It has taken the monkey off our back,'' he said. ``It's
going to change the attitude a little bit going into these playoffs
because we got rid of a lot of skeletons. This year, because we got
that last year, not having to think about the pressure of not ever
having won one is not there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   While Elway may have felt the pull of another year as he sat in
his hotel room after the victory over the Packers, he spent much of
the offseason weighing his options with his wife, Janet. His
amazingly durable 6-foot-3-inch, 215-pound frame was nicked but not
battered after 15 NFL seasons. His children _ Jessica, Gwen,
Jordan, and Jack, who range in age from 13 to 7 _ were old enough
to understand and revel in his Sunday afternoons of combat.
</P>
<P>
   In Davis and Sharpe, Elway had Pro Bowl selections in the
offensive skill positions for the first time in his career. Both,
along with receiver Ed McCaffrey, were selected again this year, as
was Elway, who will start his sixth Pro Bowl and make his ninth
appearance. In short, it was an easier decision to return.
</P>
<P>
   But Elway took his lumps, missing a career-high four starts and
a part of another game with a hamstring and rib injuries as the
Broncos started the season 13-0 before losing two of their last
three and finishing 14-2. He was 210 of 356 for 2,806 yards and 22
touchdowns with 10 interceptions. It was only the third time in his
career that he did not surpass 3,000 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got frustrating, but, no, I never looked back,'' Elway
said, refusing to blame the injuries on his age. ``If we were 1-5
at the time, I'd have probably thought differently. Your back is
connected to your hamstring. And I fell on the ball. A 23-year-old
can fall on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   But his friend and backup Bubby Brister also noticed a
contentment in Elway that probably won't translate into another
year. He said the quarterback is more relaxed, that his kids have
become a fixture around the Broncos facility and that, frankly,
Elway could have pushed himself to return to the lineup more
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think part of it was having me around,'' said Brister, who
was 4-0 and threw 10 touchdowns. ``He had some injuries that may
have caught up with him. We were winning and he was relaxed and
having fun. I think he knew that this is the time of year we needed
him healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sharpe warns that no one _ especially the Jets _ should
worry that the quarterback is intoxicated by the easy pace that
marks the twilight of his career. He threw only 23 times and for
one touchdown in the Broncos' 38-3 victory over the Dolphins last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take my chances with No. 7,'' Sharpe said. ``A great
player doesn't forget how to be great.''
</P>
<P>
   All Elway is promising right now is another 60 minutes against
the Jets and 60 more after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said,'' he said, smiling. ``This is what I came back
for.'' &QL;

FALCONS KEEP TALKING A GOOD GAME
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SUWANEE, Ga. _ Ray Buchanan knows that Minnesota's Randy Moss
has had a spectacular rookie season _ 17 touchdown catches, 1,313
receiving yards. So Buchanan, Atlanta's Pro Bowl cornerback, wants
to see just how tough Moss is on Sunday during the National
Football Conference championship game in the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to bring a butter knife on the football field and
I'm going to find out if he bleeds,'' Buchanan said Wednesday at
the Falcons' training facility. ``If you cut him and he bleeds,
that lets you know the man is human.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan suspects Moss and Minnesota's other starting receiver,
veteran Cris Carter, are not only human, they also are defensible,
despite their combined 2,324 receiving yards and National Football
League-record 29 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at their team,'' Buchanan said, warming up. ``They
haven't been against great corners. They haven't been against a
great defense such as ours. We're a humble football team. But if
somebody doesn't respect us, that's when we're going to come back
and bark and bite you in the behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan had just stepped out of his silver Mercedes after
having lunch with teammate Eugene Robinson, the free safety who
played on Green Bay's 1996 Super Bowl-winning team.
</P>
<P>
   The two eat at the same restaurant every Wednesday and Thursday,
sit in the same spot and order the same food. ``They're one game
ahead of us and that's about it,'' Buchanan said (the Vikings are
16-1; the Falcons are 15-2). ``I think we match up well against
those guys, and people are going to have to start recognizing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who is in his second season with Atlanta, has 28
interceptions in his six-year career. Robinson joined the Falcons
as a free agent during the off season. He has 50 career
interceptions, tops among active defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves believed Robinson could still play at age 35,
but wondered if he still had the drive to do the off-season
conditioning necessary to compete on a high level.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been all that we hoped for,'' Reeves said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson planned to bring his Super Bowl ring to Thursday's
practice, to show teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're riding high and as we enter the championship game; we're
just so hungry,'' he said. ``We just want to get out there and
taste what we can taste, get what we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has been telling teammates the importance of seizing
the moment. ``If we don't, the moment could pass us by and we're
sitting at home watching someone else do their thing,'' he said.
``It is incumbent upon us to get every fumble, get every
interception. If you don't get those plays, they don't come back
around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons led the NFL in take-aways with 44 and in turnover
differential at plus-20. They also scored six touchdowns on
turnovers, the most in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're a very good football team,'' Robinson said.
``Just not that many people are giving us that much credit. I don't
really care if they're the favorite. All I know is that preparation
and readiness and busting someone in the mouth legally is most
likely going to win this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said he will likely divide time on Sunday between Moss
and Carter, who produced 12 touchdowns and 1,011 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want everybody,'' he said. ``I don't care who it is. I'm
going to move around.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan was so loquacious Wednesday that he inadvertently gave
a backhanded compliment to Michael Booker, another Atlanta
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody looks at him as our weak link, but he's been doing a
great job,'' Buchanan said. ``We've been doing a good job of hiding
him and putting Eugene on top of him, where he can make some
big-time plays. When you've got Eugene Robinson covering you,
you're in great shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked Buchanan how playing in the Metrodome, a sea of
purple during Vikings games, might affect the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look up and see the color purple, we're definitely
going to be color-blind,'' he said. ``This football team is going
to rise to the occasion, no matter what hurdle you put in front of
us. We're licking our chops. We're ready to compete against those
guys.''

STATE EXAMINES TESTS TO SEE IF STUDENTS HAD UNFAIR ADVANTAGE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ga., Iowa, Fla., Wis.)  (nk) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the second day of the new fourth-grade reading
test that has stirred so much anxiety around the state, education
officials scrambled Wednesday to deal with a problem that appeared
on the first day: Thousands of children who took the test's first
section had already studied much of the material on which it was
based.
</P>
<P>
   Testing experts said those children would be likely to remember
information needed to answer questions. And the experts said the
test's publisher and the state Education Department should have
taken steps to prevent the problem before the test was approved and
administered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point here is that this clearly was an avoidable case,''
said Robert Berne, vice president for academic development at New
York University.
</P>
<P>
   Now officials say they will examine the tests of those children
_ as many as one out of every 12 fourth-graders in New York _
looking for irregularities like unexpectedly high scores on the
first day of the test.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to determine whether those children had an unfair
advantage. But it is unclear what the Education Department will be
able to learn that simply by looking at the scores and what it will
do about the problem, which was first reported Wednesday in The New
York Post.
</P>
<P>
   The test, which has prompted both praise and loathing, goes
beyond the multiple-choice questions of the past by requiring
children to read and listen to complex passages of fiction and
nonfiction, and to write essays, including a personal one, with
correct spelling, grammar and punctuation.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the three portions of the three-day test did involve
multiple choice questions, and that is the portion that was given
on Monday and that the state is now investigating.
</P>
<P>
   The state plans to use the test to determine whether schools are
failing. Scores on the test are closely watched by parents looking
for the best schools for their children, and in some districts the
fourth-grade test is used to admit children to competitive middle
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Roseanne DeFabio, assistant state commissioner for curriculum,
instruction and assessment, said state education officials were
stunned to learn that large parts of the test were nearly identical
to stories in a commercial curriculum widely used in New York,
California and other states.
</P>
<P>
   But she contended that familiarity with the material did not
invalidate the results. ``I don't think it compromises the
integrity of the test,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said any conclusions drawn from the state investigation
would be used to shape the content of future tests. ``I certainly
would not go back and change every student's score,'' she said.
``But it's important to know what the impact of the curriculum
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the five reading passages on the first day of the test
were similar to a curriculum called Literacy Place, published by
Scholastic Inc., that was purchased by 78 schools in New York City
and 185 in the rest of the state, according to city, state and test
company officials.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reading passages, ``Summer Fun,'' about a family
fishing for crawdads, differs by only three sentences in a page and
a half of text from a story that appears in a CD-ROM available with
the Scholastic curriculum, according to the New York City Board of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   Two other reading passages cover the Wright Brothers and the
inventor Elijah McCoy, who are among the subjects of 24 trade books
that come with the Scholastic curriculum, said the test's
publisher, CTB/McGraw-Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But the publisher said the reading passages on the Wright
brothers and McCoy were not excerpted from the books in the
Scholastic series but came from other original sources.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kean, a spokesman for the test company, said it had
never consulted the Scholastic curriculum when designing the test
and that the resemblances were sheer coincidence. Nor, he said, was
it company policy to compare tests and popular commercial
curriculums in an effort to prevent duplication. Kean said that
such curriculums included thousands of books and that it would be
impractical, if not impossible, to match them against standardized
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic officials declined to comment but issued a statement
Wednesday saying that Literacy Place, which was developed in 1996,
has been bought by schools and districts across the country,
including San Franciso, San Bernardino, Bakersfield and Long Beach,
Calif.; Atlanta; Tampa, Fla.; Des Moines and Milwaukee. It has also
been adopted by the Defense Department for elementary schools on
military bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gratified that our program fits so well with the New
York state test,'' the company said.

 LEO CHERNE, LEADER OF AGENCY FOR REFUGEES, IS DEAD AT 86 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leo Cherne, who turned the International Rescue Committee into
the largest agency in the world for the relief and resettlement of
refugees, died on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He was 86
and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer, economist and businessman, Cherne became chairman of
the IRC in 1951, succeeding Reinhold Niebuhr, the theologian. The
organization had grown out of modest efforts to rescue a few
thousand endangered people from Nazi-occupied France in the early
days of World War II. Under Cherne, the New York-based committee
eventually helped hundreds of thousands of displaced, dispossessed
and desperate people, first in Europe and then all over the world
in places like Bangladesh, Southeast Asia, Latin America, the Horn
of Africa, Afghanistan, Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   When Cherne was given the U.S. Medal of Freedom in 1984,
President Reagan cited the ``moral passion'' he had shown in
``serving the cause of human freedom, especially through his work
on behalf of refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherne was also an adviser to nine presidents, a close friend of
William Casey, the former head of the CIA, and from 1973 to 1991 a
member of the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board,
serving as its chairman during the Bush administration. As a member
of this low-profile but high-impact panel, Cherne helped create the
so-called Team B, a group of experts headed by Richard Pipes, the
Harvard historian, which disputed CIA assessments of Soviet
military capabilities and intentions as too dovish; the committee's
more alarming estimates bolstered the positions of the strongest
proponents of increased U.S. military expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Lionel Olmer, a lawyer and a former undersecretary of commerce,
said that during his last hospital visit to his friend of 29 years,
as the two men talked about human rights and refugees, Cherne told
him, ``I hope I'll also be remembered as a cold warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Smith, who is working on an authorized biography of
Cherne, said he was a man of great reticence and discretion. ``He
knew that the way to get and maintain influence in Washington was
to get things done and then to keep quiet about them,'' Smith said.
He added: ``It certainly worked well for him, giving him access to
every president since Roosevelt. Here was a poor boy from the
Bronx, without money or family or influence, who became the
consummate insider.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherne had been a Democrat since his youth but in 1980 became a
figure in Democrats for Reagan because of the candidate's views on
national security.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Cherne was born in New York on Sept. 18, 1912, to Max and
Dora Cherne, immigrants from Russia. His father owned a photography
store in the Bronx. He attended public schools, New York University
and New York Law School.
</P>
<P>
   After jobs in several law firms, in 1935 he teamed up with a
Bible salesman from Kansas named Carl Hovgard to establish a
company that published and distributed Cherne's advice to
businessmen on how to contend with the new Social Security law. The
book became extremely successful, and the company grew into the
Research Institute of America, which offered Cherne's assessments
about how world and political events would affect business.
</P>
<P>
   At war's end, Gen. Douglas MacArthur took him to Japan to work
on the defeated nation's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Research Institute of America was providing Cherne with a
comfortable income, and his yearly economic and political forecast
regularly drew a thousand listeners to the Waldorf Astoria. He
joined the board of Freedom House and became the chairman of the
IRC, which was in financial difficulty at the time. His aggressive
fund-raising staved off collapse and allowed for its steady
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, Cherne participated in a radio program, ``The Town
Meeting of the Air,'' on which he debated Sen. Joseph McCarthy.
Though Cherne shared McCarthy's antipathy toward communism and its
proponents, he strongly challenged and scorned McCarthyism's
demagogic methods and contempt for truth and civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, when Soviet tanks moved into Budapest to
crush the Hungarian uprising, Cherne went to the Hungarian border
to bear witness. On his return, he appeared on the Ed Sullivan
television program, poignantly describing refugees trying to evade
tanks as they fled their occupied land. The appearance evoked an
outpouring of contributions. It was the first of many such missions
and public pleas by an essentially reticent man.
</P>
<P>
   While working daily for the IRC, consulting often, if
anonymously, in Washington, and writing economic analysis, Cherne
also became an accomplished scuptor.
</P>
<P>
   He retired from the IRC as chairman in 1991 but remained
chairman emeritus and visited his office regularly until his recent
illness. He received many decorations, among them the French Legion
of Honor, Germany's Commander Cross and the U.N. Gold Medal of
Peace.
</P>
<P>
   Cherne is survived by his daughter, Gail Gambino of Baiting
Hollow, N.Y., a brother, Jack Cherne of Santa Monica, Calif., and a
granddaughter, Erica Gambino of Bridgehampton, N.Y.

 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A small group of Senate Republicans has met
secretly with the House impeachment prosecutors to devise criteria
for determining whether witnesses would be called at the Senate
trial, even as prosecutors this week approached Monica S. Lewinsky
and Kathleen E. Willey about their possible testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The question of calling witnesses to testify before the Senate
has divided Democrats and Republicans as they set procedures for
the trial. After a rare bipartisan meeting last Friday, all 100
senators agreed to vote this month on whether to call witnesses.
Such a vote would take place after opening arguments from the House
managers and the White House, which begin on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the agreement, Sen. Trent Lott, the majority
leader, announced that Democrats and Republicans had agreed to have
a bipartisan group of four senators begin meeting immediately to
try to hash out how the Senate would deal with the witness issue
later. But that group did not materialize, nor was its creation
part of the official impeachment measure passed unanimously by the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Lott then quietly went ahead on his own and appointed three
Senate Republicans who have said publicly that they favor calling
witnesses _ Jon Kyl of Arizona, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and
Jeff Sessions of Alabama _ to work with Rep. Henry J. Hyde of
Illinois, the lead manager, and other prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats were belatedly invited to a meeting of the new
group on Monday, but Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader,
rejected the offer. ``Senator Daschle's position is that we voted
on an unanimous bipartisan level to put off the question of
witnesses, so it would not be in keeping with that agreement to
start a discussion about whether to call witnesses,'' said Ranit
Schmelzer, a spokeswoman for Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spurned a similar offer from the Republican
senators after the Senate Democrats said no.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of opening arguments in the trial, still another
development over witnesses threatened to fray the Senate's fragile
bipartisan posture: Hyde said that prosecutors are considering
whether to ask the Senate to call President Clinton to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the Senate rules, we don't have any right to call him,''
Hyde told reporters after a meeting. ``We can request the Senate to
invite the president over, so we may do that.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments elicited an icy response from Clinton's aides.
``The White House has carefully respected the process adopted by a
unanimous Senate, which defers the decisions on witnesses until
each side has presented its case,'' said Jim Kennedy, a White House
spokesman. ``In contrast, the House has privately and now publicly
sought to impose its will on the Senate in defiance of the
bipartisan spirit which has characterized the Senate's conduct of
the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Senate Republicans had defended their discussions with
the House managers over witnesses, saying they were aimed at
continuing the cooperative spirit created last week in the Old
Senate Chamber. ``We conveyed the sense of the Republican caucus,
and the joint caucus, that a large number of witnesses were not
going to be permitted,'' Specter said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said the meetings, which have been preliminary, so far
have been designed to help the House managers winnow the list of
possible witnesses, which had reached 15 at one point. But Specter
cautioned that senators were careful not to advise the House
managers on which witnesses to call. So far, the criteria that the
senators hope House managers will use to determine the need for
live testimony at the trial involves evaluating witnesses who can
help resolve conflicting testimony or who are ``important in tenor
and tone.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the House managers confirmed that meetings had
taken place, but said that the senators had benefited more than the
House managers from the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering over witnesses coincided with an implicit threat
in the White House legal brief filed Wednesday, in which Clinton's
lawyers argued that any witnesses would require a lengthy full
discovery process and could lead the defense team to call
additional witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and the White House have balked at any suggestion that
senators need to hear from witnesses like Ms. Lewinsky, partly
because of the fear that the trial would spin out of control with
unpredictable testimony, and a desire to complete the proceedings
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde and other prosecutors have persisted in trying to
examine witnesses' accounts. For example, Hyde's aides disclosed
Wednesday that Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer, Plato Cacheris, had refused a
request from one of the House managers to set up an informal
meeting with Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House intern, to
question her about her account and gauge her credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Implicit in the House's right to request witnesses is the
responsibility of the managers to determine who those witnesses
will be,'' said Paul J. McNulty, a spokesman for the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from seeking to talk to Ms. Lewinsky, two of the House
managers, Reps. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas and Lindsey Graham of
South Carolina, met on Monday with Ms. Willey, a former White House
volunteer, and her lawyer, Dan Gecker, to discuss the possibility
of her appearing as a witness, said a Republican aide and another
person familiar with the case.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers, meeting in the office of a third manager, Rep.
James E. Rogan of California, raised the accusation that Clinton
had groped Ms. Willey, but they focused mainly on whether Ms.
Willey had been pressured to change her story. The House
prosecutors are interested in Ms. Willey's case to bolster the
obstruction of justice charge.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers have also talked about summoning other
witnesses, including Betty Currie, the president's secretary, and
John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll come in with a long list of witnesses,''
Hyde said Wednesday night on the ABC News program ``Nightline.``
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my expectation and request to our managers that they not
call a witness unless the witness has something substantive to
contribute,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the managers were walking a fine line in their
presentation to senators. ``I hope we don't bore them,'' he said,
``but the more detailed information we give them, the less they
want to call witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 105-page legal brief it filed on Monday, the
House sent each senator two boxes of material _ 60,000 pages of
documents, audiotapes and videotapes _ that make up the official
record of the House impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The White House issued its own set of documents, filing a
130-page memorandum that urged the Senate to acquit President
Clinton of lying under oath and obstructing justice. Clinton's
lawyers went beyond legal arguments and laced the filing with
warnings that convicting Clinton would overturn the popular will.
``Removal of the president on these grounds would defy the
constitutional presumption that the removal power rests with the
people in elections, and it would do incalculable damage to the
institution of the presidency,'' the memorandum said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Wednesday sought to distance himself from the trial
in the Senate, telling reporters, ``The most important thing for me
is to spend as little time about that as possible.'' He said,
``They have their job to do in the Senate, and I have mine, and I
intend to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   For each defense the White House offered, the House filing
disagreed, saying each accusation ``properly states an impeachable
offense, is not subject to a motion to dismiss, and should be
considered and adjudicated by the Senate sitting as a Court of
Impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The dueling House and White House documents, the second such
exchange of filings in a week, set the stage for opening
presentations in the first impeachment trial of a president in 131
years.
</P>
<P>
   The trial opens in earnest almost a year after Kenneth W. Starr,
the independent counsel, began investigating the accusations
against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Wednesday, Ms. Lewinsky's erstwhile friend, Linda R.
Tripp, went undercover for Starr to meet with Ms. Lewinsky and
record their conversations about attempts by the president to get
her a job and keep her from testifying in the Paula Jones sexual
misconduct case.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for the arguments, some of the 13 House managers
and White House lawyers walked through the Senate chamber on
Wednesday, completing last-minute logistical details and preparing
to address 100 senators in the trial with Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist presiding.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans paraded out of an afternoon meeting insisting
that over the next few weeks, they could conduct legislative
business in the mornings and the impeachment trial in the
afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the usually deliberative Senate could pull off such a
feat, Sen. Connie Mack of Florida, a member of the Republican
leadership, borrowed an explanation often given for Clinton's
ability to juggle several complicated subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a phrase we didn't use very often around here,'' Mack
said. ``It is compartmentalization.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Democrats voiced fears that a lengthy trial with many
witnesses would hinder regular Senate business. ``The key question
is the number of witnesses,'' said Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman,
D-Conn. ``If there are not too many witnesses, it won't take too
long to depose them. My guess is that we're done by sometime early
to mid-February.''
</P>
<P>
   But if many witnesses are called, Lieberman said, the trial
could extend into March.

 GIULIANI: REST OF THE COUNTRY SHOULD TAKE SOME OF NEW YORK CITY'S
TRASH
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Facing growing resistance from other states to New
York City's garbage, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Wednesday that the
rest of the nation was obligated to take it in return for the many
cultural and financial benefits reaped from the city.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's comments came in the wake of growing opposition to
accepting New York City trash in Virginia. Concerned that a major
disposal company is preparing to increase its shipments of trash
from New York, Gov. James S. Gilmore III called for limits to
prevent his state from becoming ``a dumping ground for East Coast
garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, at his daily news conference Wednesday, elaborated on
his philosophy of waste disposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York City has a specialized problem,'' he said. `'It comes
from the fact that we're so crowded and ourland mass is very small,
and that brings great benefits to the rest of the country, like
Virginia. People in Virginia like to utilize New York because we're
a cultural center, because we're a business center. What goes along
with being a cultural and a business center is you're very crowded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the room here to handle the garbage that's
produced not just by New Yorkers,'' he continued, ``but by the 3
million more people that come here that utilize the place every
day. So this is a reciprocal relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that relationship, the mayor continued, the rest
of the country should help the city with waste disposal. ``We don't
do it because we're profligate, we don't do it because we're
wasteful,'' he said of exporting the city's trash. ``We do it
because there are a lot of people in the city and that brings great
benefits to the American economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore, in a text of his State of the State message Wednesday
night, continued his opposition to out-of-state trash. ``I believe
the commonwealth has a right _ and I would say a duty _ to ban the
use of barges for the transportation of garbage on Virginia's
waterways,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest criticism arose when Waste Management Inc., a major
national disposal company, recently signed a contract with a barge
company that would enable up to 4,000 tons a day to be shipped to a
new port in Charles City, Va., on the James River. Waste Management
already transfers 2,400 tons of New York City garbage a day to
Virginia and other destinations.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism from Virginia came a month after the mayor
surprised and infuriated Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey with a
proposal to ship residential trash to transfer stations in her
state. She issued a news release with the headline, ``Whitman to
New York's Garbage Plan: Drop Dead'' and called the plan ``a direct
assault on the beaches of New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Giuliani dismissed such criticism as a ``knee-jerk
political issue'' and said a ``counterforce'' of communities
supports the garbage industry for the business and jobs it creates.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people move beyond just a sort of knee-jerk political
issue here,'' he said, ``there's a whole industry out there, and
this will continue and it will be part of waste disposal for the
next 50 or 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor raised the possibility of litigation to force other
states to accept the city's waste.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure is growing on the city's garbage disposal system as the
legal deadline for closing the city's Fresh Kills landfill on
Staten Island at the end of 2001 approaches.

 SENATE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL BEGINS AMID UNCERTAINTY  &HT;     By LOUIS FREEDBERG 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three hundred and fifty eight days after President
Clinton's affair with a White House intern became public, the
Senate will begin Thursday in earnest to consider whether he should
be ousted from office for perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The trial begins with only the barest of road maps. Still
unclear is how long it will last, whether the Senate will call
witnesses, or what the Republican strategy is in pursuing a case
that almost certainly will not result in a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Constitution requires a two-thirds majority
in the Senate to oust a president from office. Barring some
extraordinary new and damaging revelations, it is inconceivable
that 12 Democrats will join the 55 Republicans to provide the
necessary 67 votes.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors disclosed Wednesday that they had attempted
earlier this week to interview Monica Lewinsky, whose relationship
with Clinton is at the heart of the impeachment trial. The
prosecutors said they wanted to talk to Lewinsky to prepare for the
possibility that the Senate will vote to call her as a witness. But
her attorneys rejected the House request, and Lewinsky remains out
of sight.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors reportedly also contacted another potential
witness, Kathleen Willey, who has alleged Clinton made a sexual
advance on her in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried Wednesday to reinforce the message he has been
sending for nearly a year _ that the scandal has not impaired his
presidency. Pointedly, he will not even be in Washington during
Thursday's opening arguments, but instead will be in New York with
Jesse Jackson for a meeting of Wall Street executives.
</P>
<P>
   `I think the American people would like it if somebody up here
was putting their interests first, their business first, and I
think that's what they expect me to do,'' he said before meeting
with labor leaders to discuss next week's State of the Union
address.
</P>
<P>
   The White House continued to insist that Clinton will deliver
the speech before a joint session of Congress, as is customary, on
Tuesday, despite suggestions by Republicans that he postpone giving
it, or simply send a copy of it to Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that ``900 constitutional experts'' feel strongly that
what he is accused of does not warrant removal from office. ``But
my opinion is not important here,'' he said. ``I should be doing my
job for the country, And other people should be handling the
defense and dealing with this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers sent to the Senate the most detailed defense
yet of the president's actions. The brief focused on both the
broader constitutional consequences of the Senate's actions, as
well as the minutiae of who said what to whom in various legal
proceedings involving independent counsel Kenneth Starr and the
House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   `It is the citizens of these United States who will be affected
by and stand in judgment of this process,'' the concluding
paragraph of the 130-page document stated. ``It is not simply the
president _ but the vote of the American people rendered in
schools, church halls and other civic centers all across the land
26 months ago _ that is hanging in the balance.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief accused Starr of ``engaging in an unauthorized attempt
to gather embarrassing information about the president'' long
before reports about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky were
first published on Jan. 21, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers allege that Starr began looking into Clinton's
connections to over a dozen women, including Paula Jones, without
getting permission from the Justice Department to expand his
investigation beyond the Whitewater land deal in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The report quotes Jones spokeswoman Susan McMillan Carpenter as
saying in June 1997, ``I will never deny that when I first heard
about this case, I said, `OK, good, we're going to get that little
slime ball.'''
</P>
<P>
   The report also zeroes in on specific words in the articles of
impeachment. The first article, for example, accuses Clinton of
perjuring himself by saying that he was alone with Lewinsky on
``certain occasions,'' when in fact he was alone with Lewinsky ``20
times, and had 11 sexual encounters.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers argued that a measure of the House's ``extraordinary
overreaching'' is its allegation that ``11 occasions of intimate
contact over more than a year did not occur by an objective
standard `on certain occasions.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also challenge the House ``managers,'' or
prosecutors, to explain why Clinton gave gifts to Lewinsky _ on the
very day he is accused of getting his staff to retrieve them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must therefore be assumed that on the very day the
president and Ms. Lewinsky were conspiring to hide the gifts that
he had already given to her, the president added to the pile,'' the
lawyers wrote. ``No stretch of logic will support such an
outlandish theory.''
</P>
<P>
   At 1 p.m. EDT Thursday, all 100 senators will assemble in the
Senate chambers, with Chief Justice William Rehnquist wielding the
gavel. They will first hear an opening statement from Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. He will be
followed by Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., one of the 13
impeachment managers appointed by the House, who will give a longer
statement that he says will ``lay out the case and show very
clearly that the president committed an impeachable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the ground rules adopted by the Senate last week, the
House managers will then have 24 hours spread over three days to
make their case, and the White House will then have 24 hours
beginning next week for its defense.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for the trial, Republican leaders issued a
one-page memo Wednesday outlining the proper decorum for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Senators will be required to be in attendance during all
proceedings. The memo instructed typically loquacious senators to
``refrain from speaking to neighboring senators while the case is
presented.'' Nor will they be permitted to read any extraneous
materials. ``Our individual reading materials should be confined to
only those readings which pertain to the matter before the
Senate,'' the memo advised.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist must also be addressed as ``Mr. Chief Justice.'' Last
week when the trial opened, some senators addressed Rehnquist as
``Mr. president'' _ referring not to Clinton but to the president
of the Senate.

   It's been fun writing about Michael Jordan. So many places and
big events. So many memories. Here are excerpts from a few of mine
. . .
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC; 
They sat at a long table, on display like our first space heroes,
the Mercury astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, Johnson, Ewing, Robinson, Barkley, Pippen, Stockton . .
.
</P>
<P>
   America's finest. The Dream Team.
</P>
<P>
   As photographers' strobes washed them in stuttering bursts of
light, the greatest collection of basketball talent ever assembled
traded grins and sidelong glances and listened through earphones as
questions were translated into English.
</P>
<P>
   From Japan: ``Mr. Jordan, can you tell me how does it feel to be
called a god?''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan looked at his smirking teammates. ``I've never
seen a god, so I don't know how a god would act. I take it as a
compliment.'' &QL;

   &UR; Black, sleek, it lay as if asleep, a panther in repose. Ferrari
Testarossa. Pirelli racing tires. Cellular phone. Vanity plates:
`M-Air-J.''
</P>
<P>
   J.R. ``Jelly'' Roll gazed admiringly at the Italian Batmobile.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just ``one'' of his cars,'' said Jelly, an employee of
Bismarck Food Services, the caterer at Chicago Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can afford a Testarossa,'' Charles Barkley said,
unimpressed. ``What is it? $100,000? $240,000?'' Then the playful
zinger, (a reference to Jordan's gambling habits): ``That's just a
couple of rounds of golf. . . .'' &QL; 
 &UR; _ Chicago, June 16, 1993 &QR; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is Houdini. He should play in a tuxedo. Points appear
from his hand like endless scarves blooming from a magician's
sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   Only one man could have beaten the no-quit Suns in Game 4 of the
NBA Finals. Only one athlete in the world could have upstaged
Charles Barkley (32 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists), and here he
came, as dreaded as a midnight telegram, with the Bulls leading by
only two points and the clock ticking down . . . 16 . . . 15 . . .
14 . . . his eyes on the basket, his shaved head beaded with sweat,
coming hard now into the red paint, driving the lane, poised and
filled with purpose. &QL; 
 &UR; _ Chicago, June 17, 1993 &QR; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   There was no man in Michael Jordan's life over 6 feet tall.
Michael sometimes asked his mother, ``How tall was the milkman? How
tall was the mailman?''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was teasing. As far back as he can remember, there always
was James Jordan, provider, role model, disciplinarian, companion,
best friend.
</P>
<P>
   James Jordan sat in America West Arena and watched the Bulls
beat the Suns for their third consecutive NBA title. That was less
than two months ago . . .
</P>
<P>
   Now James Jordan is gone. Someone fired a bullet into his chest
and dumped his body into a creek.
</P>
<P>
   Who would do this? Why? As questions demand answers, Michael
Jordan has gathered with family members. He has come home, as
families do, to grieve and to remember the joys of a lifetime of a
father's love. &QL; 
 &UR; _ Aug. 15, 1993 &QR;

   Please tell me the greatest basketball player ever to fly
through the air hasn't played his last game. Tell me Jordan is not
retiring. Not now. Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Michael ``is'' the Bulls. Jordan and the Bulls are as synonymous
as DiMaggio and the Yankees, Shoemaker and Churchill Downs, Hoover
and the FBI. &QL; 
 &UR; _ Chicago, Oct. 6, 1993 &QR; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   I've never felt a crowd embrace an athlete so completely as the
7,454 in this little ballpark did when Michael Jordan stepped up to
bat.
</P>
<P>
   C'mon, Mike, wait for your pitch. Good eye. Be a hitter now . .
.
</P>
<P>
   At the plate, he looks so tall, and thin, like a marsh bird in
pinstripes. His strike zone is as big as his name.
</P>
<P>
   It is strange thinking of him as an underdog. We've only known
him as the best, the greatest, unstoppable. &QL; 
 &UR; _ Sarasota, Fla., March 13, 1994 &QR; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Most of us thought Jordan would have a change of heart and
return to the NBA someday. His announcement that he is leaving
baseball reinforces the rumor he is about to rejoin the Bulls. Has
any professional athlete retired from two sports, and unretired
from one?
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan is the one athlete on the planet I would pay to
see come back. &QL;

red-and-yellow charter bus eased through the back entrance at
America West Arena and pulled to a stop with a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   The coach, Phil Jackson, stepped out first, lost in thought,
trailed by the general manager, Jerry Krause.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one by one, the cast emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wennington. Toni Kukoc. Luc Longley. Dennis Rodman, the

   Jud Buechler.

   Then, from the back of the bus, the man. He wore a muted gray
business suit, silk necktie, suede shoes . . . He ambled loosely
down the hallway, smiling and nodding acknowledgment to groups of
arena employees who pressed against the wall and watched with rapt
expressions, as if viewing a one-man parade . . . &QL;

D-BACKS DEMAND DWINDLES  
 SEASON-TICKET SALES MAY DROP BY 10,000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the Diamondbacks have spent nearly $120 million to
upgrade their ballclub, the club will fall far short of matching
its season ticket total from its inaugural season.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials are projecting the major league-high
season-ticket base of 36,000 from last year to dip somewhere near
26,000. That's a 28 percent drop, but the figure still will place
the Diamondbacks among the top four of the 30 big-league clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The drop-off comes in the wake of a ticket price increase
averaging 12 percent, from an average of $14.69 per seat in 1998 to
$16.48 in 1999. The price increase was announced on Fan
Appreciation Weekend, inciting a wave of criticism. In addition,
many fans likely realized that a season-ticket package, even if
shared with others, was more of a time commitment than they
bargained for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little bit disappointed, but when you look at the
numbers across the rest of baseball, we're where we want to be,''
said vice president in charge of ticket operations Diane Aguilar.
``We still expect to be in top three or four in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Colorado, Baltimore and Atlanta are expected to have larger
season-ticket bases for the 1999 season. Cleveland, which
anticipates selling out its fifth full consecutive season shortly,
caps season-ticket sales at 26,000, leaving 17,000 single-game
tickets available for its 81 home dates.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians have already sold 3.3 million of its 3.4 million
available tickets.
</P>
<P>
   While the loss of 10,000 season tickets will surely be felt
within the organization, the Diamondbacks remain well ahead of
their expansion brother, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, who are expected
to have a base somewhere around 19,000 for the 1999 season,
slightly down from their inaugural base of 22,000.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, which has led the major leagues in total attendance
during each of its six years in existence, is anticipating a drop
of only 500 in its season-ticket base, a figure that would still
place the Rockies' base at 32,500. Colorado drew just under 3.8
million fans last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks ticket base, as of Wednesday, was right around
25,000, Aguilar said. She said there is a waiting list of about
1,000 new ticket holders who will be added once last year's
season-ticket holders finish buying their 1999 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the club sent out letters requesting the
final installment for 1999 season tickets. Some invoices say the
deadline for such payments is Jan. 29, but Aguilar said it has been
extended to Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only fair to extend the deadline because it took us
longer than expected to get these invoices out,'' Aguilar said.
</P>
<P>
   To help boost season-ticket sales, the Diamondbacks are strongly
considering selling mini-season ticket plans, similar to those used
by the Coyotes and Cardinals. In addition, single-game ticket sales
will begin sometime early next month. &QL;

   Proceed, if you will, to discuss all the hot shots, flights of
fancy and tongue-out-of-cheek moments. Michael's greatest gift to
his public might be the you've-never-seen-it-before,
never-see-it-again aura.
</P>
<P>
   But the most memorable moment here from somebody who spent 10
seasons tracking and covering the man, his words and his life came
long before he ever won a championship ring or shaved his head.
</P>
<P>
   When Michael Jordan first signed on to play for the Chicago
Bulls, he insisted his contract include a ``love-of-the-game''
clause. This, he insisted, would give him the OK to play
basketball, no matter where, no matter when, no matter who else was
on the court.
</P>
<P>
   And so what we will miss most now that His Highness has left the
building is that love of the game.
</P>
<P>
   You must love the game when you sprain an ankle in the third
quarter of a playoff game in Atlanta, have to be carried to the
locker room, then come back to score 14 fourth-quarter points as MJ
did in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   You have to love the game when some guy named LaBradford Smith
has a career-high 36 points on you one night in Washington, and you
come back to score 36 points on him the next night.
</P>
<P>
   You have to love the game when you go to a local mall to buy a
pair of shoes only to have the entire shopping public find out you
are there and trap you inside that store.
</P>
<P>
   You must love the game when you want to go Christmas shopping
for your newborn daughter Jasmine, but are resigned to sitting in
the manager's office of a downtown Chicago mall while merchants
bring you presents to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   The love-of-the-game clauses for this tribute could easily
become a glut of run-on sentences, but that wouldn't be the parting
message Michael Jordan wants to submit.
</P>
<P>
   No, Michael made his last will and testament during his farewell
sequel yesterday from Chicago. He took responsibility for what the
NBA has become for better and for worse, and hereby bequeathed the
following.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unfortunate thing either myself or some of the other
players before me has brought more to focus is the financial aspect
of the game,'' he preached. ``I think that's going to have to
dissipate a little bit and get more back to the love of the game.
The love of the game is what you do on the basketball court.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Michael was sticking his tongue out at his NBA brood one
last time yesterday. Love the game. Don't play it for money, play
it to win.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yes, Michael Jordan loved the game because he loved to
win. We will miss that, too, that Air for the dramatic of scoring
50 in mid-February in Sacramento or stealing the ball from Karl
Malone or whatever it takes to win.
</P>
<P>
   Another great athlete of this century had a similar will to win.
Not Ali. Not Ruth. A legendary tale about Secretariat suggested
that after the great horse died, an examination of his heart found
that it was twice as big as that of a normal thoroughbred
racehorse.
</P>
<P>
   My theory is that Jordan had the same anatomical advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The magic of television will keep us from missing the hot shots,
flights of fancy and tongue-out-of-cheek moments. ESPN Classic
Sports will give us 56 consecutive hours of those this weekend, and
we will never have to settle for just telling our kids what it was
like to see Michael play.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Jordan's retirement unquestionably leaves us with
love lost.
