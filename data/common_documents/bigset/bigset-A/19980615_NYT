COST OF N.Y. CITY WATER PROJECTS WORRIES EVEN ENVIRONMENTALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City has embarked on an array of water and
sewer projects whose cost will raise water bills so high over the
next 10 years that even environmentalists are beginning to raise
alarms.
</P>
<P>
   The bill for the coming projects, which are mandated by federal
environmental laws, is $8.5 billion _ by far the biggest item in
the city's capital budget. The cost will be borne by ratepayers,
who are expected to see an unbroken string of increases in their
water bills _ on top of the huge jumps in rates in the late 1980s
and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   While they support the projects in concept, some environmental
groups fear that asking ratepayers to accept too many increases all
at once could undermine long-term political support for the
environmental efforts. The groups, along with city officials and
landlord and housing advocates, are exploring ways to spread out
the big projects or accomplish them more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   The spending includes up to $1 billion for a new
water-filtration plant, more than $800 million for new sewers, and
$4 billion for sewage plant improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's logical to ask whether we have to do everything at the
same time,'' said Jim Tripp, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense
Fund who also serves on the city's Water Board, which sets water
and sewage rates. ``Can we spread things out? Can we delay some of
the investments?''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Goldstein, a lawyer for another group of environmentalists,
the Natural Resources Defense Council, echoed that, saying, ``There
is a need for some sensible priority-setting and triage.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five years, average water rates are forecast to
climb to $534 a year for a single-family home, from $433. Already,
water rates have gone up by 207 percent since 1986. Cheap water,
long a feature of life in New York City, has become a memory, as
rates have hit levels comparable to those elsewhere in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Increases in the last few years in New York have been relatively
modest, and a rise of just 4 percent is in store for next year. But
the forecast for a five-year increase means such slow growth will
not last forever, just as the low interest the city pays on the
bonds that finance water projects could rise in the future, city
officials warn.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been significant revenue gains in recent years,
largely the result of more aggressive billing, but further gains
will probably be harder to achieve, the water experts say.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the city is scrambling to find ways to build these
projects less expensively and stretch out the time frames, even as
federal environmental regulators, who can impose large penalties
for failure to comply with environmental laws, oppose such steps.
</P>
<P>
   Among the options city officials are considering are pilot
projects to test removing nitrogen from treated sewage, devising
cheaper ways to protect upstate reservoirs, and cutting the size of
a water filtration plant by a third.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Miele, commissioner of the city's Department of
Environmental Protection, said setting priorities was most
important. The questions, he said, are these: ``Are all these
things necessary? And if they're necessary, are they necessary on
the proposed scale?''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that most of the coming large expenditures are
the result of court-ordered settlements in suits brought by federal
and state environmental regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, of the Environmental Defense Fund, said there are a
number of steps that could be considered. One possibility is to use
federal agricultural money intended for wetlands protection to help
pay for protection of city reservoirs. Officials could also delay
building the later phases of a third water tunnel from upstate, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp also suggested working with pilot plants to develop a way
to clean the sewage and storm water that flow together when it
rains, in an effort to find the cheapest method. A citizens
advisory committee is already exploring ways to make this project,
as well as others, more efficient.

HUNDLEY TAKES CRUSADE TO OUTFIELD 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ By 1 o'clock on Sunday afternoon, the
energy was flowing out of Todd Hundley as freely as the
perspiration was dripping from his pores.
</P>
<P>
   During a two-hour workout under the Florida sun, Hundley took
live batting practice for the first time since undergoing
reconstructive elbow surgery last Sept. 26, shagged flies in right
field, practiced throwing from the outfield and ran backpedal
sprints.
</P>
<P>
   As determined as Hundley is to learn to play the outfield, he
seems even more determined not to allow his spirit to be broken by
the New York Mets organization he has been a part of for the last
dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a quitter,'' he said. ``And I'm not going to quit on
this organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hundley, who is still bothered by the way the Mets have
treated him since trading for Mike Piazza on May 22, admitted on
Sunday that he is engaged in a sort of crusade to find out who in
the Mets organization told the news media that he might have a
drinking problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``What have I done?'' Hundley said. ``Have I been arrested,
gotten a dui, been accused of rape? I haven't done anything.
Someone in the organization has it out for me. If I had done
something, I'd stand up to it. But I haven't done anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley is not the only one who has been affected by the
controversy over the Piazza trade. Over the weekend, Piazza
admitted that he is a little uncomfortable, too, because of what
Hundley has gone through.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, at least, Hundley seemed to be enjoying learning a
new position. ``There are definitely ways to make this work,'' he
said. ``And I'm down here working on a solution to their problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley added that he could be ready to return to the Mets in
about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outfield-wise, it's close,'' he said. ``Real close.
Catching-wise, that's a different story. Maybe five to six weeks.
But I could play the outfield and swing a bat in another couple of
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to be in the Yankee series,'' he said, referring
to the interleague series that begins on June 26. ``But that's not
my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hundley is given the OK, Manager Bobby Valentine will have
to find a place to play him. Hundley all but ruled out sharing
first base with John Olerud, which is one reason he began to work
in the outfield this weekend. Under instructions given by General
Manager Steve Phillips, Hundley will continue to take fly balls in
left and right fields.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes sense. No regular in the Mets' outfield has more
than nine home runs. Hundley has hit 71 home runs in the last two
seasons. Bernard Gilkey is batting .251, Butch Huskey .249. Brian
McRae is batting .230. The last time Hundley hit below .259 was
1994.
</P>
<P>
   First, of course, Hundley has to show he can play the outfield.
After first saying he would play the position if the Mets gave him
a no-trade clause, he now says he said he will play the outfield
even if they don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even if they say no deal on the no-trade, I would still
hope they wouldn't trade me to a noncontending team, as much time
and effort as I have put into this organization,'' Hundley said.
</P>
<P>
   More time and more effort will be required. But Rich Miller, the
organization's minor league outfield coordinator, who has been
working with Hundley, sees some promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him there's a good chance of him becoming an adequate
outfielder,'' Miller said. ``He's a good athlete and this is a new
challenge. He just doesn't have his legs or his wind yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley has slimmed down, however, and is near his playing
weight of between 195 and 200 pounds. He said he told Phillips:
``Give me some time in the outfield. I might take the catcher's
gear and burn it.'' &QL;

WINNING IS GERMANS BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-GERMANY-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; PARIS _ The wives and girlfriends are sunning themselves in
Juan-les-Pins, a beach or two out of reach. That was the plan. The
Germans may be quartered on the Riviera, but this is no vacation.
It's a boot camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I told you some of the things they are doing, you wouldn't
believe it,'' says US soccer captain Thomas Dooley, who grew up in
the Fatherland and knows its players by heart. ``They are even
controlling the phone calls from the rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   This ain't no party. This ain't no disco. This ain't no fooling
around. The Germans flew down last week from Frankfurt, checked
into their chateau at La Colle-sur-Loup, and three hours later were
working out inside their practice stadium in Nice. They don't come
to the World Cup to live out some adidas video. The Germans come to
win it. Always.
</P>
<P>
   They are supposed to beat the Americans Monday night in their
opener here in the Parc de Princes. They are supposed to win their
group, then go on to defeat the Belgians, Romanians, French, and
Brazilians and claim the Cup for the fourth time since 1954. The
Germans have done the math, as they always do.
</P>
<P>
   And if their calculus went cuckoo last time in America _ nobody
figured the Bulgarians would put them out in the quarterfinals _
it's all the more reason why they're leaving nothing to error this
time. Because this is their last roundup.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans, who average 30 years of age, are the oldest in the
32-team field. Three of them _ captain Jurgen Klinsmann, Lothar
Matthaeus, and Juergen Kohler _ have at least 100 international
caps. Four of them are playing in their third Cup. The 37-year-old
Matthaeus, who was captain when Germany (technically, West Germany)
won in 1990, is playing in his fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Almost nobody back home wanted Matthaeus on the team again. Not
coach Berti Vogts, who dumped him two years ago when Germany won
the European championship. And certainly not Klinsmann, who's been
barely on speaking terms with Matthaeus since their playing days at
Bayern Munich. ``I have no problems with Matthaeus the football
player,'' Klinsmann says, pointedly.
</P>
<P>
   Even Matthaeus didn't expect to be here. He'd booked a sunny
vacation months ago. Then Matthias Sammer had knee surgery and Olaf
Thon had ankle problems and Vogts came calling.
</P>
<P>
   He made it clear to Matthaeus that Klinsmann still would be
captain and that Matthaeus probably would be a reserve. ``I'm not
afraid of being on the bench,'' says Matthaeus with a shrug. ``I
was there in 1982. I know what it's like. I've had a long talk with
the coach about my role and we've come to an agreement. If I don't
play at the start, then I'll work to get into the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Most folks figure that Matthaeus will be on the field sooner
rather than later, especially if the Germans start off playing the
way they did during qualifying. After tying four matches _
including Northern Ireland at home _ Germany took it down to the
final day, defeating hapless Albania by only 4-3 at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were having so many problems in qualifying that I called
Lothar,'' says Dooley, who played a dozen years in Germany. ``I
told him, they need you in there to kick some butts. So when he
came back, I was happy for him but unhappy for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Another year, the Deutscher Fussball Bund would have bought
Matthaeus a rocking chair and told him to watch on TV with the old
folks back home. But this time the DFB is determined to dust off as
many creaking idols as it has to, because the Germans sense that
the Cup is theirs for the taking.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians seem out of rhythm. The Italians were lucky to
tie Chile. The English have nobody who's ever played a Cup match.
The Argentines never have won the Cup when it's been in Europe. The
French _ when have the Germans lost to the French when it mattered?
</P>
<P>
   And after what happened last time, when the Germans mailed in
the first round (beating Bolivia and South Korea each by a goal and
tying Spain) and squeaked past Belgium before the Bulgarian
debacle, they have much to prove to the doubters back home.
</P>
<P>
   When Vogts's old men take on the Yanks Monday night on the edge
of the Bois de Boulogne, everything will stop from Rostock to
Munich. ``No cars in the street,'' says US playmaker Claudio Reyna,
who plays for VfL Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga. ``Everyone sitting
in front of a TV set. You have 4-year-old kids and 85-year-old
grandmothers watching Germany playing Armenia in a qualifier.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unthinkable to them that Germany will lose to the
Americans. Not with a golden trophy at stake that comes around once
a quadrennium. ``Germany is always there to play,'' says Reyna.
``They'll always fight and they'll always run, even if the game
isn't going well.''
</P>
<P>
   They did not come for le bronzage on the topless beaches along
the Cote d'Azur. This ain't no fooling around. No sightseeing, no
shopping, and no phone calls from the room. ``I do not think,''
Dooley says, ``that the Germans have played golf here.''

US MAKES WORLD CUP BOW 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-US-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ They'd been sequestered (or imprisoned, depending on
whom you ask) in their ivy-covered chateau out in Beaujolais
country for more than a week. They'd met all the roosters and
ducks, they'd fed the fawns, they'd listened to the grapes grow.
They'd had la vie rustique up to their ears. ``And we'd broken
almost all our darts,'' reports striker Brian McBride.
</P>
<P>
   So the United States men's soccer team had no choice but to come
here and play the Germans Monday night in their World Cup opener at
the sold-out Parc des Princes, their biggest match since they met
Brazil four years ago in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal is to advance to the second round, as they did in
1994. But this time the task is decidedly tougher. Besides Germany,
the European champions and three-time Cup winners, the Americans
have politically-charged dates with Iran (June 21 in Lyon) and
Yugoslavia (June 25 in Nantes).
</P>
<P>
   Few outside their own camp give them much of a chance of
surviving their group or of beating the Germans, and the Yanks
understand that. ``In Europe, they have no respect for the US,''
says coach Steve Sampson, whose squad is a 150-1 shot to win the
Cup. ``And quite frankly, we have not earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, after all, are only 10-29-5 against European
teams in Europe over the years and have been outscored, 123-42.
When Sampson's squad was being blanked in Belgium in February,
German coach Berti Vogts walked out with 20 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans are 2-0 against the US (4-3 and 3-0 in the States in
1993) and fully expect to make it 3-0 Monday night. Their
chancellor, Helmut Kohl, openly predicted a 3-1 victory a few days
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the back of their minds they think if they knock the ball
around, there is no chance for us to get it,'' says US captain
Thomas Dooley, who grew up in Germany and played a dozen pro
seasons there. ``Most people in Germany think that Americans are
not that good at soccer. But now we can show them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, the Yanks are far from the innocents abroad that they
were in 1990, when they went three-and-out in Italy. ``It was kind
of a fluke that we went in at all,'' says midfielder Tab Ramos,
who's playing in his third Cup. ``We were just a bunch of college
guys. We were tourists out there. But now, we're a team people have
to watch out for.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the US played erratically in its Cup qualifiers, it shut
out Brazil in February and demolished Austria in Vienna in April.
``This is a team that always responds to great pressure,'' Sampson
says.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the pressure Monday night will be on the Germans,
who have a habit of playing uninspired Cup openers (2-1-2 in their
last five). ``They need very badly to beat us, so they can go into
their match with Yugoslavia (a 1-0 victor over Iran Sunday) with
less pressure,'' says US midfielder Claudio Reyna, who plays for
VfL Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans would be delighted with a tie, and they've been
saying that since last year's draw. ``Realistically, if we get a
point that'd be great,'' says Reyna.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, they'll have to play out the full 90 minutes against
a German side that traditionally leads the world in focus, stamina,
and technical savvy. ``Discipline and organization is their biggest
advantage,'' says Dooley. ``Everyone knows exactly which position
he is playing. If the coach says, you can't go up and down, you are
not going.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Americans have an advantage, it's that they know the
Germans inside and out. Seven of them (Reyna, Dooley, McBride, Eric
Wynalda, David Regis, Joe-Max Moore, Chad Deering) either play in
Germany now or have in the past. ``There will be no surprises,''
Sampson says.
</P>
<P>
   The US knows that the Germans build attacks from the back, using
gifted sweepers like Lothar Matthaeus, a five-time Cupper, and Olaf
Thon. ``Those guys can change the game and put everything
together,'' says Dooley. The Germans take control in the midfield,
then seek to service the most dangerous strikers in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Jurgen Klinsmann, who has scored eight goals in the last
two Cups, may be 33 but he netted four in a match this season for
England's Tottenham Hotspur. Oliver Bierhoff, the hero of Germany's
European victory, led Italy's Serie A in scoring with Udinese. And
Ulf Kirsten was Bayer Leverkusen's ``tormeister''. ``They're all
deadly,'' says US defender Eddie Pope. ``You have to worry about
every one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, who have shut out Kuwait, Macedonia, and Scotland
in their last three international matches, figure that their
midfield-heavy 3-6-1 formation could hold the Germans to a goal.
Question is whether they can crack the Germans' 3-5-2 with only one
striker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The striker has to make the ball stick,'' says Roy Wegerle,
who could start there for the US Monday night if Wynalda isn't
fully fit after spring microsurgery on a knee. ``If it doesn't, the
system goes out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans know that the German defenders will swarm their
striker and try to knock Reyna, whom they know by heart, off the
ball. But they also know that they don't have to score _ and
Deutschland does. ``If we can keep it tied up as long as
possible,'' muses midfielder Ernie Stewart, ``they'll start
panicking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks had seven relentlessly isolated days to dream up any
number of scenarios. Now, their vie rustique is fini. Last week,
barnyard animals were their amusements. Monday night, it's guys
named Jurgen.

O'LEARY, SOX GO EXTRA MILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It wasn't pretty. But maybe the Red Sox have mastered
the knack of beating up on the have-nots of the American League
East like they're supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, their 3-2, 10-inning victory over the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays before 27,768 Sunday night at Fenway Park falls into that
category. Both teams had chances to win, but it was Boston that
prevailed on a one-out RBI single to right by Troy O'Leary. It
scored Nomar Garciaparra, who had singled and moved to second on a
bunt single by Mike Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox (39-26) swept the two-game, rain-shortened series.
The loss for last-place Tampa Bay was its first in five
extra-inning games this year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the box score might not entirely back it up, this was a
game dominated by pitching. The teams combined for 23 hits, 13 by
Tampa Bay. But strong showings by Boston's Steve Avery and Tampa
Bay's Tony Saunders, both lefthanded starters, kept the score
close. After a while, it became a contest of which bullpen would
wilt first. Tampa Bay used seven pitchers, the last being Jim
Mecir, who gave up O'Leary's winning hit. Boston used five
pitchers, with the victory going to closer Tom Gordon, who worked
out of a jam in the top of the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Boston took a 1-0 lead in the first and it was all Avery could
do to hold it for the next four innings. The run followed a leadoff
walk to Darren Lewis, a stolen base, and a wild pitch on ball four
to John Valentin. Lewis scored easily on a sacrifice fly by
Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Tampa Bay tied it. Kevin Stocker beat out a bunt
single off Avery and moved to second on a ground out. Another
grounder sent him to third, and then Wade Boggs rose above a chorus
of boos by the Fenway Faithful, slamming a double off the Wall to
score Stocker.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay took a 2-1 lead in the sixth on a solo home run by
Bobby Smith, his fifth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Boston rebounded in the bottom of the inning to tie the game at
2. Valentin led off with a walk and moved to third on a single by
Garciaparra. Valentin just beat a throw by right fielder Dave
Martinez and a tag by Smith. Tampa Bay manager Larry Rothschild
came out to argue and was thrown out of the game by third base
umpire Rocky Roe.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin scored on a Mo Vaughn single.
</P>
<P>
   Avery left after six and was replaced by Derek Lowe. The Devil
Rays immediately mounted a threat, as Stocker singled and moved to
second on a bunt. After getting Quinton McCracken to ground to
second, moving Stocker to third, Lowe was replaced by lefthander
Ron Mahay. He did his job, getting Boggs to fly to left.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay threatened again in the eighth, and Boston escaped
with some marvelous defensive play. Fred McGriff led off with a
single to right and moved to third on a hit by Smith. Martinez
followed with a grounder to second. Rather than give up the run,
Lou Merloni threw home in time to get McGriff.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Corsi replaced Mahay and was part of an even better play.
With runners on first and second, he got Mike DiFelice to hit into
a 3-6-1 double play. Vaughn made a brilliant stop, ranging far to
his right, to start the play, and Corsi hustled to the bag at first
and scooped up a low throw from Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   Boston squandered chances in the eighth and ninth innings.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the 10th, Boggs doubled to left, his third hit
of the night, off Gordon. McGriff was walked intentionally. Smith
grounded into a force at second, Boggs moving to third. But the
threat died when Martinez flied to center after working Gordon
through 10 pitches.

O'LEARY, SOX GO EXTRA MILE

   BOSTON _ One thing the Red Sox are doing well this year is
beating up on the have-nots. If there is a shortcut to the American
League playoffs this year, that may be it.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Sunday night's 3-2 victory over the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays before 27,768 at Fenway Park falls into that category. The
game took 10 innings and both teams had chances to win. But the Red
Sox prevailed on a clutch RBI single to right by Troy O'Leary. It
wasn't pretty, but these days it doesn't really matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pitched good and we played good,'' said manager Jimy
Williams. ``When we do that, we've always got a chance to win.
Tampa Bay had a tough lefty in Tony Saunders. But we competed, and
that's what you ask for from your players.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has been preaching this philosophy all year. A victory
like Sunday night's means his players not only are listening to the
game plan but are executing it. The Sox got six decent innings out
of Steve Avery, who left with the game tied at 2-2. Then they won
it as Derek Lowe, Ron Mahay, Jim Corsi, and Tom Gordon performed
their roles to perfection, holding Tampa Bay scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders also provided six good innings; the Devil Rays used six
pitchers in relief of him. O'Leary made the final one, righthander
Jim Mecir, pay.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston 10th started with a single by Nomar Garciaparra off
Albie Lopez. That was followed by a bunt hit by Mike Benjamin, who
had entered in the eighth as a pinch hitter. Tampa Bay then brought
in Matt Ruebel, who induced Reggie Jefferson to line to short.
</P>
<P>
   Then Tampa Bay manager Larry Rothschild turned to Mecir, who has
a reputation for pitching lefties tough and getting ground balls.
He got the grounder, as on a 2-2 count O'Leary hit a sharp shot
that first baseman Fred McGriff could not handle. It was McGriff
who had foiled an O'Leary bid for extra bases on a hard smash in
the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got me the first time,'' said O'Leary. ``I thought I had
hit the ball real good. But McGriff never moved off the bag and was
right there. The second time was different. Mecir is a righthander,
but he's tough on lefties. I think he wanted me to hit into a
double play. And if you look at my stats, I do. But it didn't
happen. He threw me a couple of fastballs inside. So I looked for
one and I got it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox (39-26) swept the two-game, rain-shortened series.
</P>
<P>
   The teams combined for 23 hits, 13 by Tampa Bay, but it was
pitching and defense that won the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the Tampa Bay eighth, McGriff and Bobby Smith led off with
singles, putting runners on first and third. McGriff then tried to
score on a ground ball to second and was nailed by a perfect throw
by Lou Merloni.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were cheating in a little bit,'' said Merloni. ``If it was
hit hard and we had a shot at McGriff, we said we'd go for it. The
ball wasn't hit too hard. But I kinda caught it high and he wasn't
going too hard to home plate. So I came up throwing. Probably if
I'd thought about it I would have gone for a double play. It was
just something that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Williams brought in Jim Corsi, who got Mike DiFelice to hit
into a 3-6-1 double play. Mo Vaughn made a dynamite stop to start
it. Corsi finished it with a nice scoop of a wide throw by Nomar
Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a Mickey Mouse pick,'' said Corsi. ``It was a good
one. I just busted my butt to get over to first. I got to the bag
and I was looking for the ball. Nomar got rid of it quick and threw
it a little bit to the right. I picked it. Afterwards, I got
excited.''
</P>
<P>
   He flipped the ball to the umpire backhanded and put on the
biggest smile at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a game,'' said Williams. ``You had Merloni's (throw),
Vaughn and Corsi on the double play in the eighth, Nomar's plays at
short. Their lefthander was putting goose eggs on the board. But
Avery pitched a good game for us.''

PIPPEN'S PAIN PUSHES JORDAN TO GREATEST FEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The limping Scottie Pippen worked his way
through the pack surrounding a fatigued but elated Michael Jordan
and embraced him with the most gingerly of hugs when it was over.
</P>
<P>
   It was a most powerful moment for a duo that may never be
together again if the Bulls dismantle. A second later, Pippen, who
played the game with severe back pain, was in tears because of his
emotions as the Bulls celebrated their sixth title in eight years,
eliminating the Jazz, 87-86, on Sunday night in Game 6 of the
National Basketball Association finals at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hurting pretty bad,'' Pippen said. ``At the start of the
game I was able to get a dunk and I came down, and the pain built
from that point. Every time I tried to run I was getting spasms. I
took the treatment, and told them I was going to try and gut it
out. I felt that my presence on the floor would mean more than just
sitting in the locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Pippen, the victory may have been Jordan's greatest
feat. He put together a miracle performance that included 45
points, while Pippen played on with his face pinched in pain
because of a sore back that left him limited, at best, and absent
for much of Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen's restricted effectiveness touched every part of the
Bulls' strategy, from rebounding to defense, from offense to
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Without Pippen, Jordan was left to fight the fatigue of this
long series and long playoff run. Somehow, he made up the void.
Jordan stripped Karl Malone with 18 seconds left, then come down to
hit the game-winning shot with 5.2 seconds left to give the Bulls
the title.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen had a cortisone shot Saturday and felt some relief from
the pain that crept up on him after taking five charges in Game 3.
The discomfort may have had something to do with a 2-of-16
performance in Game 4, an effort that belied a series effort that
had many proclaiming him the most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Now the player who had been a defensive menace to the Jazz
walked off the floor and disappeared into the tunnel leading to the
locker room with 4 minutes 56 seconds left in the first quarter.
All of the electric stimulation he had before the game to loosen up
his back had not helped.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen underwent further treatment through the first half. He
returned to start the second half with a wince, only to leave
again. He came back with 9 minutes left in the game. Although he
was severely limited, Pippen's presence meant something. At least
he could function as a decoy.
</P>
<P>
   It was going to be up to Jordan to grab the Bulls by the collar
and keep them in the game. Jordan played all but two minutes in the
first half, ending it by hitting 9 of 19 shots for 23 points to
keep the Bulls within reach of the Jazz, down by just 49-45.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Pippen returned in the third quarter, he was more of a
decoy than a playmaker. The Jazz had to respect his presence, but
Pippen was clearly not himself. That was obvious midway through the
third quarter when he missed a layup that normally would have been
made via an explosive dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has always known how important Pippen has been to his
success and to his team's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Scottie Pippen is a major reason why we're here,''
Jordan said before Game 5. ``I think he's a unique and creative
player. The harmony between us is incomparable. You can't compare
it to anything. It's just a rhythm you build with another player.
To play without him is like a slap in the face for me.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Jordan, wondering how he would play next year if Pippen
bolted Chicago in free agency. Pippen wouldn't commit to anything
on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to let it all soak in and think about that
later,'' Pippen said. ``There are a lot of opportunities for me,
and I have to look down the road at my future. After all this soaks
in, you just never know what's going to happen.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For three rounds, he had been the story. He
outplayed his best friend, Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe, in the first
series. In the second, against Ottawa, he shined against the
offensive talents of Alexei Yashin and Daniel Alfredsson. Then, he
outdominated the Dominator _ Dominik Hasek _ in leading the
Washington Capitals to the club's first Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   Like Godzilla, after whom he is nicknamed, Olaf Kolzig had been
bigger than life in the postseason _ until now. The Capitals'
stellar netminder and his teammates are one loss from being swept
in the finals by the defending champion Red Wings. If Detroit wins
Tuesday night in Game 4 at the MCI Center, it will mark the fourth
time in four years that the finals have been won in a sweep.
</P>
<P>
   After Game 3 Saturday night, which was won on a shot by Sergei
Fedorov with 4:51 left in regulation after Brian Bellows had
rallied Washington to a 1-1 tie only 4:34 earlier, Kolzig sat in
his locker-room stall fielding questions about what has gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could just as easily be up 3-0 and I think everybody in
this dressing room knows that,'' said Kolzig. ``I'm not going to go
out on a limb and say we outplayed the Red Wings by any means
because that's not true. But a bounce here, no call there, we could
easily be up 3-0 and we all realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge for the Capitals is remaining positive
despite the enormous odds they face.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a choice,'' said Kolzig. ``If we fold our tents
and decide just to mail in the game Tuesday, what does that say
about the Washington Capitals? Until they win that fourth game, the
series isn't over. It's obviously a monumental task to come back,
but funnier things have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Only once. Since 1939, when the best-of-seven championship
format was implemented, teams winning Games 1, 2, and 3 have won
the Cup 23 of 24 times. The only time that didn't happen was in
1942, when Detroit won the first three games and Toronto won four
in a row to win the Cup. Kolzig said he and his teammates are
frustrated by the circumstances yet remain hopeful they can stage a
comeback because all three games have been decided by one goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to use the whole part of it because if you use the
frustrated part of it, you're not going to be anywhere in Game 4,
so we've got to realize we played just as good as these guys and
easily could be up 3-0,'' he said. ``If we get frustrated, we've
got no chance in Game 4.''
</P>
<P>
   After losing Game 1, Washington appeared in the driver's seat in
Game 2 with 3-1 and 4-2 leads. But the Red Wings rallied, winning
in overtime. Kolzig said that one really hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the game in control and it would've gotten us a split
out of there,'' he said. ``Coming into this building, we might have
had a whole lot more confidence. Not to say we didn't have any
confidence, but we would've known we beat the Detroit Red Wings. In
the back of our minds, we were saying, `We're right there with
them, we can beat these guys.' But until we actually do, I don't
know if we would've come out with quite as much hunger as if we
would have won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolzig said perhaps depth has been the difference but he also
allowed that perhaps the real difference has been an intangible _
knowing how to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years ago, they lost four straight to New Jersey, so they
knew what it was like to lose,'' he said. ``The year after, they
lost in the semifinals to Colorado. They knew how it felt to lose.
Last year, they put it all together. They took all the experiences
from the past and put it together and now they know how it feels to
win. I don't want to say, `Well, maybe that's what we need is to
lose' because that's definitely the experience we don't want, but
if we can get back here next year, then we would know how it feels
right now. I still think we're in this series.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Capitals' offense has been stymied in two of the three
games, Kolzig said the Red Wings deserve credit for preventing
Washington from implementing its game plan. At the same time, the
Wings have come at the Capitals from all angles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're obviously a pretty deep team,'' Kolzig said. ``You
really can't concentrate on one guy like you did in the first two
series. We had to concentrate on (Bruins center) Jason Allison and
then Alexei Yashin in the second. If you take Steve Yzerman, that
leaves Fedorov. If you take Fedorov, that leaves Yzerman and Igor
Larionov. You can just go down the list with the amount of depth
these guys have. We have to play great against them as a team and
not concentrate on one individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the defending champs, obviously, they know what it
takes to win. They feel they can win every game. We've got to find
a way to believe we're invincible, too.''

DE LA HOYA MUST EXTEND HIS REACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; EL PASO _ Oscar De La Hoya said he wanted to fight the best
again Saturday night, but he continues to fight the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after devouring a French pastry named Patrick
Charpentier in less than three rounds at the Sun Bowl, De La Hoya
told a worldwide television audience that he ``wanted a chance to
make history.'' Minutes later he was talking about an already
scheduled September rematch with aged Julio Cesar Chavez, a fighter
who already is history.
</P>
<P>
   In November, promoter Bob Arum already has said, De La Hoya will
fight another Mexican national, 154-pound champion Yory Boy Campas,
whom rising welterweight challenger Jose Luis Lopez made history
when he beat him half to death, thus convincing Campas to add seven
pounds to get away from people like him.
</P>
<P>
   Those are not fights designed to make history. They are fights
designed to make money, an approach to prize fighting that is not
without precedent but is one whose time has run out for De La Hoya
if he truly hopes to reach the place he and his handlers seem to
think is his birthright.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been a perfect fighter, but Oscar has so much
potential he could end his career, in most people's eyes, as the
greatest fighter who ever lived,'' Gil Clancy, the veteran trainer
of Emile Griffith, said after his latest pupil had knocked
Charpentier flat three times before the fight was stopped at 1:56
of the third round, which was only two times less than Charpentier
hit him all night.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who ever saw Sugar Ray Robinson when he was really
sweet or Muhammad Ali when he was really Ali or Sugar Ray Leonard
when he really could get away with stealing another man's nickname
or Mavelous Marvin Hagler when he really was, that seems a long
reach. But the '90s are the time of hyperbole and hype, so a
fighter who is 28-0 with world championships in four weight classes
inspires such comments regardless of their validity.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they might prove accurate because De La Hoya is only
25 with at least five good years ahead of him and probably more.
But by that age, Leonard, for example, already had fought Roberto
Duran twice, Wilfred Benitez, and Thomas Hearns. De La Hoya has
fought only one man, Pernell Whitaker, who could be termed a
world-class fighter.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, De La Hoya did fight a string of former or present
champions since he first won the junior lightweight title several
years ago, but these days boxing has more belts than Brooks
Brothers, so a champion's belt no longer automatically means you
can fight. It assures only that you're well-connected.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, De La Hoya is both. He is well-connected and he can
fight. But when will he fight the welterweights most likely to
fight back? When will he step in with World Boxing Association
champion Ike Quartey or International Boxing Federation titleholder
Felix Trinidad or even Lopez, who on his best days even De La Hoya
conceded last week was perhaps his most difficult opponent at his
present weight?
</P>
<P>
   Sounding like a revivalist preacher, Arum will say ``How long?
Not long!'' But then he schedules Chavez, a fight De La Hoya now
calls ``personal,'' and Campas, a fight that is about only one
thing _ sucking more money out of the wallets of De La Hoya's rabid
Hispanic fan base.
</P>
<P>
   Arum says he has offered Quartey $3.5 million, Trinidad $7
million, and Whitaker $4 million knowing those figures will not
make any of those fights because they are not negotiations, they
are dictates, and such men will not be dictated to.
</P>
<P>
   In Whitaker's case, $4 million at the time it was offered was
nearly a 50 percent pay cut for a rematch when he barely lost the
first fight on a night that did big pay-per-view business.
</P>
<P>
   In Trinidad's case, $7 million is more than he can make
elsewhere but is barely 30 percent of the likely revenues from
their all-Hispanic confrontation. A mere No. 1 contender like
Charpentier could end up with 25 percent if a bout of his simply
went to purse bids, so why would Trinidad or his father/manager
agree to such a number?
</P>
<P>
   In Quartey's case, he is in the midst of legal battles with
past, present, and probably future promoters and managers, so Arum
knows he is in no position to make a deal with De La Hoya or anyone
else of note until those crossed lines are straightened out.
</P>
<P>
   So how can such fights be made if that is Arum's approach? The
same way they were made when Leonard was fighting Duran twice and
Hearns and Benitez. They will be made the day De La Hoya tells Arum
rather than the world that he wants to fight the best.
</P>
<P>
   The day he walks into Arum's office in Las Vegas and tells him
to make the Trinidad fight or the Quartey fight or the Lopez fight
or he'll find someone who will, those fights will be made. Until
then, Arum will continue to make matches like the ones De La Hoya
has fought for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   He will make high-paying, low-risk pay-per-view matches like the
ones with Hector Camacho, Chavez, or Campas and the
less-high-paying but even lower-risk ones on HBO for $4 million a
pop like Saturday night's batting practice exhibition against
Charpentier.
</P>
<P>
   That fight left nearly 45,000 fans in El Paso wildly cheering De
La Hoya but it left boxing experts cold. It was what it was
designed to be. It was an execution for De La Hoya's benefit,
restoring the belief for some that the knockout power he had at 130
and 135 pounds has come with him up to 147 even though he had
stopped only one man, an African version of Charpentier named David
Kamau, since moving up to the welterweight division to fight
Whitaker 14 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya finally seems to have sensed that while his
popularity among Hispanics has skyrocketed, his pay-per-view and
HBO ratings slowly have begun to erode. He remains arguably the
second biggest draw in the sport next to the Godzilla of boxing,
Mike Tyson. Yet his numbers are going down at an age when they
should be going up, and in his heart he knows why.
</P>
<P>
   They have begun to slide because it is one thing to talk about
fighting the best and quite another to do it.
</P>
<P>
   So it is time for De La Hoya to stop talking about greatness and
start reaching for it, and that will require the one thing
promoters like Arum abhor. It will require he take a risk.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Arum says Trinidad and Quartey will go out as quickly
as Charpentier and perhaps he is right, although it is dubious. If
they do, De La Hoya's greatness will be established regardless of
what follows those fights. If he fights great battles and wins
despite grave difficulties, as Leonard did in his first
confrontation with Hearns, De La Hoya's greatness will be
established regardless of what follows as well. If he fights a
great battle and loses, as Leonard did in his first meeting with
Duran, De La Hoya's greatness still could be established if what
follows are stirring victories over similar opponents as Leonard's
were.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya long has said he wanted to pattern his career after
Leonard's. Arum used to say the same thing. So the path to the
greatness they seek already is laid out for them.
</P>
<P>
   That path makes a man rich but not because he seeks only money.
That path leads a man to greatness not because he can attract young
Hispanic girls to throw their bras at him, as some did to De La
Hoya last week, but because he can stand up when men as young and
fast as he is throw punches at him.
</P>
<P>
   So if greatness is what Oscar De La Hoya truly seeks, all he has
to do is get on that path Hagler and Leonard and Ali and Robinson
walked.
</P>
<P>
   It is the path that leads to fearsome opponents like Trinidad
and Lopez and Quartey and others that may follow them.
</P>
<P>
   It is the path of pain.
</P>
<P>
   To boxing greatness, it is the only path that exists.

REVOLUTION BURNED BY FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ One could blame the fact that the New
England Revolution are without Joe-Max Moore and Mike Burns, who
are playing for the US national team at the World Cup. Or maybe
that Jair is out of the lineup until the end of the season because
of a left ankle fracture.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe that defender Manny Motajo was sitting out because of a
couple of yellow cards he received the week before against the Los
Angeles Galaxy, which means that the Revolution were playing
without a player because of that reason for the third time in the
last four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's 3-1 loss to the Chicago Fire before 6,823 at
Foxboro Stadium (17,054 paid), was for a different reason.
</P>
<P>
   Defender David Nakhid sprained his right ankle early in the
second half, with 41:13 left in the game, as he ran out of bounds
next to his team's bench. He went back in the game, but then was
substituted for by Dahir Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
   ``One player makes a difference in our chemistry,'' said the
Revolution's Thomas Rongen, who attended but did not coach Sunday
because of travel surrounding his assisting the US World Cup team.
``When David went out, we were not able to physically or mentally
stay with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution were fine in the first half, the teams tied, 1-1,
at halftime. But the Fire scored the only two goals in the final 45
minutes. It was the sixth consecutive loss for the Revolution, who
are now 4-9. The expansion Fire are 9-5 and have won their last
seven contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kind of established their game in the second half,'' said
Revolution assistant coach Renato Capobianco, who ran the team from
the bench. ``Their game tatically changed with Nakhid's injury and
you can understand why Chicago is on that winning streak. Their
defense as a unit and the way they possessed the ball in the attack
with numbers, they didn't allow you very much time to get
organized.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fire, who at one time had a five-game losing string, scored
first, in the 25th minute when Jerzy Podbrozny converted a pass
from Jesse Marsch on the right side. Revolution midfielder Ted
Chronopoulos stretched to try to get to the pass, but he couldn't
reach it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear anyone tell me there was a runner behind me,''
Chronopoulos said. ``I should have known there was someone behind
me. I take the total responsibility for it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution evened it in the 39th minute, on a penalty
kick by Raul Diaz Arce. He kicked a blazer to the low left side,
past Fire goalkeeper Zach Thornton. It was his eighth goal of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution could have done better. ``We had four good
chances to score that first half and we didn't put in those
chances,'' Capobianco said. ``We need to put those chances away and
we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the second half, when the Fire did everything well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't stick with the runners very well,'' Chronopoulos
said. ``Our defense didn't play that well.''
</P>
<P>
   Richie Kotschau scored in the 60th minute, on a header from 12
yards out. It was the third straight game in which Kotschau has had
a goal. And then came the insurance goal, at the 85th minute, when
Podbrozny, while facing Revolution defender Richard Goulooze,
flipped the ball high over his head, and over Ian Feuer's
6-foot-7-inch frame as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good goal,'' Feuer said. ``You can tell he's a class
player, the way he stroked it and it dipped just under the
crossbar.''

MALONE HAS HIS TITLE SHOT RIPPED AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Karl Malone turned around, and it was him
again.
</P>
<P>
   It was the man who has always managed to steal the moment Malone
has craved and swipe the title that he has struggled to grab for 13
years. It was Michael Jordan again. And at some point, long after
he arrives home from the Delta Center, Malone may look over his
shoulder and see Jordan's haunting figure once more, just as he did
on Sunday night with 18.9 seconds left in Game 6 of the National
Basketball Association finals.
</P>
<P>
   That was when Jordan, part of a double team, stripped the ball
away and snatched the series' life from Malone. A stunned Malone
could only watch Jordan tear off from the scene like a getaway car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karl never saw me coming,'' Jordan said. ``I was able to knock
the ball away.''
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, Malone witnessed Jordan transform his turnover
into a title-winning shot with 5.2 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to counter Jordan's jumper, the Jazz was left to exit
its own building with an 87-86 loss. As Malone departed, he had to
make his way across a floor flooded by the Bulls as they celebrated
their sixth title in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Malone walked after with a couple of televised comments, saying,
``I'm not a quitter,'' when asked about his future. But there was
nothing more. He did not show up for interviews to face questions
about his lapse at the end or how Jordan had swooped down to
overshadow him again. Malone's 31 points were no match for Jordan's
45.
</P>
<P>
   So for the first time in anyone's memory, John Stockton walked
in before the cameras and microphones all alone after the game. No
Malone by his side. Just as the Bulls had done all season, on
Sunday night they had cut the tether between Stockton and Malone.
For two years, Stockton and Malone have been tied together in a
three-legged race to catch Jordan in the finals. They fell again.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you may expect, I'm not real open with my emotions,'' the
typically stoic Stockton said. ``But it's a painful experience, I
can tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockton could have erased Malone's mistake, but his rushed
3-pointer at the buzzer bounced off the front of the rim. Just like
the Jazz, the ball fell short of the mark. But Stockton was not
going to blame Malone for this, not his partner. ``I like my
chances with Karl every time,'' Stockton said. ``He scores, he
makes plays. So there.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Jazz players walk away with images in their heads that
will stay there for some time. Malone will have Jordan to think
about. And the Jazz will have a couple of calls to remember. The
24-second violation that wasn't, for one. In the first half, Howard
Eisley appeared to get off a 3-pointer just before the shot clock
expired. But it was waved off.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you going to do?'' Coach Jerry Sloan asked. ``You're
still the loser.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz are not packing it in, though. Sloan does not buy the
belief that this was the last chance for Stockton, who is 36, and
Malone, who turns 35 next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our future will be just fine,'' Sloan said.
``Obviously there are some young players out there and young teams
to compete with. But we've been hearing the same story for five
years, and how our window of opportunity has closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Malone's chance to steal a moment from Jordan is over.
Jordan may retire, Scottie Pippen may exit as a free agent and the
Bulls may never be the same. But typical Jazz, stubborn to the end,
few of them believe this was their last shot at the six-time
champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This won't be Michael's last one,'' Stockton said. ``That's
been a nice story. But he's not quitting. He'll be back. Scottie
will be back and Phil Jackson will be back. I'm tired of hearing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The sound might not have been so deafening if Malone had held on
with 18.9 seconds left. If he had, the Jazz might have pushed the
Bulls to a Game 7. But it has been in these critical moments _ like
the time he froze at the free-throw line of Game 2 in Chicago
during last year's finals _ when Malone has been left to see Jordan
emerge as the star.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bitter pill to swallow,'' said Sloan, who was
talking in general but might as well have been referring to Malone.
``But that's why they are champions. You have to be strong mentally
and not allow things like turnovers to happen. Michael made big
plays, and he deserves credit for that.''

OKAROH LENDS REVOLUTION HELPING HAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ There's no question that Francis Okaroh
misses his home, Woburn. He played for the Revolution for two
seasons and was named the team's best defensive player, even better
than headliner Alexi Lalas.
</P>
<P>
   It showed during his first five or six games this season with
expansion Chicago that he was hoping the Revolution and the Fire
would work a trade to get him back to Foxboro Stadium. It was never
worked out, though. The Revolution, who left him available for the
expansion draft, have no plans to bring him back.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Okaroh told himself he was going to start playing
rather than wondering if he would spend his entire season in
Chicago. And that's just about the time the Fire started their
winning string, which is now at seven after Sunday's 3-1 win over
the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Francis has been great with us,'' said Fire coach Bob Bradley.
``He's defending with experience and he can play with the ball out
of the backfield. He's always trying to help our younger players
and we picked him because we still feel he's one of the best
defenders in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't easy with him, this is his home. We try to show
him how much respect we have for his play. He's become a large part
of our team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself that the trade wasn't going to happen,'' said
Okaroh, the former Norwood High soccer coach and Boston
University's No. 3 all-time scorer. ``I want to stamp my name with
this organization. Those other two seasons with the Revolution are
in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   At 34, the Nigerian-born Okaroh is helping the younger players
on the team, passing on the experience he has gained while playing
with the Revolution, seven games for the Nigerian national team,
and 13 games in 1987-88 with the Cleveland Force indoors team.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was here I also did some coaching and it's something I
like doing,'' he said. ``When I see a younger player with
potential, I help coach any way I can. It's a young team and I have
to read the game and get involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think to some people we're still an expansion team. They
still think that we don't have a good defense, but we don't mind
that. We just keep working, and we're still not anywhere where we
want to be, but we hope to get there by the time the playoffs
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the Fire lost five in a row. They are winning now with
the same personnel, and they have the best goals-against in Major
League Soccer (1.16) and a nice 9-5 record.
</P>
<P>
   With Okaroh spearheading things back on defense.

PREKI AN OLD HAND AT THIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; PARIS _ The US national team spent Sunday attempting to avoid
attention while preparing for its opening game in the World Cup
finals.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials had invited the press to an 11:30 a.m. training
session at Parc des Princes, site of Monday night's match against
Germany, then went elsewhere for a 10 a.m. practice. The players
arrived at Parc des Princes, a 40,000-seat stadium in the 15th
arrondisement, at 12:40 p.m. and within 20 minutes had toured the
field, talked briefly with about 75 journalists, and rushed to
board a bus.
</P>
<P>
   A national team functionary disrupted interviews and urged
players to hurry through the ``mixed zone'' that had been set up
for that purpose. Alexi Lalas and Eric Wynalda, two of the more
popular choices for both the domestic and international press,
actually hurdled a fence to get away. They looked less like
professional athletes than starving artists pursued by gendarmes
after skipping on the check.
</P>
<P>
   It was a ludicrous scene. The US players, isolated in Chateau de
Pizay for two weeks, seemed appreciative that someone was
interested in them. And, as tout le monde knows, they need the
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the players did not stay long enough for anyone
to measure whether the pressure of the World Cup was affecting them
as much as their administrators.
</P>
<P>
   At least midfielder Preki Radosavljevic seemed unaffected by the
frenetic attitudes. He became a US citizen in 1996, but part of his
heart remains with his former countrymen and teammates in
Yugoslavia. Preki must have had other worries besides Monday
night's match.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough game,'' Preki said. ``We'll see.
Hopefully, we will be ready to play. But you really can't know
until then.''
</P>
<P>
   Preki the pragmatist. He is a virtuoso player, the most
brilliant of the national team at solving one-on-one
confrontations. With interviewers, he charms with a clever line, a
quaint phrase, a blunt assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yugoslavia is where my family lives and I will always go back
there,'' Preki said. ``Not to stay, though. America is my home now.
What I would like is for Yugoslavia and the US to qualify for the
second round. That would mean we would have to knock Germany out.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a long shot, but Preki should be expected to support his
homeland and his home, especially since he played with many on
Yugoslavia's national team while developing in the Red Star
Belgrade system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not talked to any of them for a while,'' Preki said.
``I am staying away from that because they are the opposition. I
talk to a lot of friends and family from Yugoslavia, but not many
of them will be here because it is hard to get out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yugoslavia should have a good team because they have a lot of
talent. They just have to play together. I always thought they
would be better with the Croatian players and all the others,
because if you put them all together there is even more talent.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Preki's first and last World Cup. He has had an
adventurous life so far _ time in the post-Tito army, a
professional career in the US, England, Portugal. Now, Preki is
raising a family in Kansas City and he is eager for the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   But he likely will not be in the starting lineup against
Germany, Iran (in Lyon June 21), or Yugoslavia (in Nantes June 25).
Preki is faced with a conundrum _ though he is the team's most
skillful player, until his teammates catch up he will not be a
full-time performer. In other words, the US will be in a
conservative, defensive mode in an attempt to avoid being
devastated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will play the way I always play,'' Preki said. ``I will play
to help the team. How long can you defend? You can't defend for the
whole tournament. We will have to play offensively sometimes, score
a couple of goals if we want to make it to the second round.''
</P>
<P>
   Preki did just that in the last tournament, the CONCACAF Gold
Cup in California. He scored the winner against Costa Rica as the
US qualified for the semifinals, and the winner against Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't try to copy anybody else,'' Preki said. ``Why try to
copy when you are 35 years old? I do my own thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Germans. It doesn't matter if you are old. It
matters how you play.''

REPEAT THREE-PEAT FOR BULLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ They may have grown tired of each other, of the
Medici Court intrigue in the organization, of the waffling comments
of the supernova, and the boorish antics of their
attention-seeeking non-conformist.
</P>
<P>
   But they never have grown tired of the feeling they felt Sunday
night, when the final horn sounded in a suddenly din-less Delta
Center, signaling yet another championship for the Chicago Bulls.
Once again, they set aside all the friction, tumult, and lunacy and
triumphed when it mattered most.
</P>
<P>
   Title No. 6 came courtesy of an 87-86 victory over the Jazz, a
likable, laudable lot who simply happen to be, like so many others
this decade, victims of bad timing. They had to confront the
messiah, Michael Jordan. The series MVP, in what could be the final
game of his brilliant career, had 45 points, including the
game-winner, as Chicago took the series, 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   With Scottie Pippen (bad back) all but a decoy, Jordan basically
turned the clock back to 1988 and did everything. His shot wasn't
always falling _ he was 15 for 35 _ but he got to the line (12 for
15) and hit two biggies down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   In the final 40 seconds, Jordan blew past Bryon Russell for a
hoop off the glass, then stripped Karl Malone to force a huge
turnover _ ``He never saw me coming,'' Jordan said. And, of course,
hit the winner with 5.2 seconds left. That was a stop-and-pop from
the foul line, made easier when Russell slipped, giving Jordan an
open look. If that is his last shot, he went out in true style.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment starts to become the moment for me,'' Jordan said
of that last possession. ``Things move slowly and I saw that
moment. I took advantage of that moment. I never doubted myself. I
never doubted during the whole game. Scottie was hurt. Dennis
(Rodman) was in foul trouble. But we kept hanging in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Said coach Phil Jackson, ``Michael is a guy who comes through.
He always comes through. He's a real-life hero.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz, too, were heroic to the end. Malone had a big game,
with 31 points, 11 rebounds, and 7 assists. His shot was falling.
But he also had five turnovers, including the big one with 18.9
seconds to play when Jordan took it away from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought hard,'' Malone said. ``It's tough. It's a tough
loss. But give them credit. They won. What else can you say?''
</P>
<P>
   Utah, which also got 17 points from Jeff Hornacek, looked like
it might be home free when John Stockton (10 points, 5 assists)
knocked down a trey with 41.9 seconds to play. That snapped an
83-83 tie and put all the pressure on the Bulls. But putting
pressure on Jordan is almost asking for it. Even though he had
missed five straight shots, he kept firing and made the last two.
</P>
<P>
   Utah still had plenty of time. But Stockton missed a long trey
and the rebound was swatted away, ending a truly exciting game.
Coach Jerry Sloan said he wasn't happy with the way Utah ran the
final play, ``but we were just trying to get a shot. You just can't
afford to give them a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the ball bounced away and the game ended, the Bulls' bench
erupted. Jordan and Jackson hugged and Sloan, classy to the end,
stayed on the court to congratulate the gutsy Bulls. Malone hugged
Pippen, and Pippen broke down in tears. Rodman, who had 7 points
and 8 rebounds in 39 big minutes, celebrated, undoubtedly knowing
he now can hit Las Vegas with regularity. Jordan found his mother
and gave her a hug.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen played only 26 minutes, 19 in the second half. His sore
back was the topic of much pregame conversation and it was learned
that he had had a cortisone shot. He tried to be his usual force,
but clearly was in pain after opening the scoring with a dunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was so difficult,'' he said. ``I felt I was letting my
team down. I tried to gut it out and I felt my presence out there
was important. I didn't know how much I was going to be able to
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams shot well _ Utah was at 50 percent, the Bulls at 51 _
and, over the final 39 minutes, the biggest lead by either team was
6. The Jazz led, 83-79, with 2:30 left on a Malone jumper, but
Jordan then hit four straight free throws. He scored the Bulls'
final 8 points.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, the triumph came as much because of
Chicago's perseverance as its ability to shield. This was a team so
overloaded by distraction _ a team that seemingly was rent asunder
in theory before it played a single game _ it's a wonder it even
got this far. Jordan may or may not come back. Pippen may or may
not come back. Jackson may not come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We planned this as our last year,'' Jackson said. ``We're
celebrating this as our last year. Unless something unusual comes
out of left field, I don't expect to see us back together again.''
</P>
<P>
   Their chaotic season started with that uncharacteristic loss in
the FleetCenter to the running, trapping Celtics. The team absorbed
the loss of Pippen for 38 games and still shared the best record in
the league with the Jazz. It endured the ongoing soap opera of
Jackson's future, the occasional Al Haig injections of muscle by
management and, finally, its severest playoff test in years. It's
unlikely any team has had to go through what this team went through
_ and not only lived to tell about it, but learned to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   This may indeed be the end. If it was, the Bulls showed, as
Madonna sings, ``there's no greater power than the power of
goodbye.''

BULLS SNATCH ANOTHER CHAMPIONSHIP WITH 87-86 VICTORY OVER THE JAZZ
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout)  (sw) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ At some point, his skills will have to recede.
He will not hit the last-second shot or drive the lane with fire
and flair. He will be more than good, but less than great. He will
not be able to put all the magic together in one unreal sequence _
the way he did on Sunday night, seizing another world title in 37.1
scintillating seconds at the age of 35.
</P>
<P>
   In an encore that is not likely to be repeated _ but who can
tell anymore? _ Michael Jordan stole the Utah Jazz's soul while
adding the most incredible flourish yet to his legend.
</P>
<P>
   He made an 18-foot jump shot from the top of the key with 5.2
seconds left, sending the Chicago Bulls to their sixth National
Basketball Association title in eight seasons with a pulsating
87-86 victory in Game 6 of the finals. The shot came after he had
stolen the ball from Karl Malone along the baseline with 18.9
seconds remaining and Utah ahead by 1 point.
</P>
<P>
   He had already made a driving layup with his team trailing by 3
points with 37.1 seconds left. He scored the Bulls' last 8 points
as they won the NBA championship by four games to two.
</P>
<P>
   After Jordan's final basket, John Stockton's 3-pointer just
before the buzzer was off target, ending this wild game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got the ball, I looked up and saw 18.5 seconds left,''
Jordan said, describing the play that led to his last shot. ``And I
felt like we couldn't call a timeout; it gives the defense an
opportunity to set up. It was a do-or-die situation. I let the time
tick to where I had the court right where I wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great look. And it went in.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockton had made a 3-pointer to send the fanatical crowd into a
frenzy with 41.9 seconds remaining, seemingly all but sealing a
Game 7 here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Never had Jordan's throne seemed so shaky, his dynasty so
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   And then he went to work. He could have been starring in a video
game, or in a Hollywood fantasy _ or both _ when he drove the lane
and scored almost uncontested. He had missed five straight shots
from the perimeter before then, and had been lucky to get to the
free throw line on two out-of-control drives.
</P>
<P>
   He stole the game from Utah. He stole the season. He tamed the
rowdiest crowd in the league. And if he walked out of the
dead-quiet Delta Center on Sunday night and never came back to
basketball, he could retire for the second time knowing he went out
with unmatched brilliance. To go with his sixth championship
trophy, he also won his sixth award as most valuable player of the
finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the best performance ever by Michael Jordan at a
critical moment in a critical series,'' Bulls Coach Phil Jackson
said as he puffed on a cigar after the game. ``No one has ever done
it better.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan scored 45 points in 44 minutes, taking 35 shots because
he had to. His teammate Scottie Pippen was suffering from back
spasms.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Kukoc finished with 15 points, and Pippen played as well as
he could in 26 minutes. Malone finished with 31 points and 11
rebounds, working hard for every shot and trying his best to force
a decisive seventh game.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Hornacek added 17 points for Utah, and Stockton was all
over the floor, contributing 10 points and 5 assists.
</P>
<P>
   But the night, as usual at this time of year, belonged to
Jordan. With the Bulls trailing by 49-45 at halftime and by 66-61
after three quarters, he began to pace himself, almost as if he
knew how the ending would play out.
</P>
<P>
   The sequence that truly shifted the momentum involved Jordan's
sneaking along the baseline like a blitzing linebacker about to
blindside a quarterback. Malone had just received the ball in the
post with less than 20 seconds remaining and the Jazz ahead.
Suddenly, Jordan swooped in, and the ball was no longer Utah's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karl never saw me coming, and I was able to knock the ball
away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen cried as he began embracing Jordan along with other Bulls
teammates at midcourt, after Stockton's shot had been tipped out to
the perimeter and the clock had sounded. It may have been the
thought of this Bulls team possibly not returning that got to him _
along with Jordan, Pippen and Dennis Rodman, the Bulls have four
other free agents _ or it may just have been watching the greatest
player ever performing another on-court miracle.
</P>
<P>
   But as they raised their sixth championship trophy high into the
air, the Bulls may have been celebrating their perseverance as much
as their dominance. Less than 48 hours after losing their homecourt
advantage with a Game 5 loss at the United Center, failing to give
their hometown fans a party, they came out and proved their merit
by winning a third straight championship for the second time in the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the moment, and I took advantage of the moment,'' Jordan
said. ``I never doubted myself. I knew we had an opportunity to win
this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, a sky-walking shooting guard emerged from the
shadows of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, grabbed the NBA's torch
and gracefully elevated toward the rim. A new order had come to
what was becoming America's game.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, he refuses to come down.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls' two-year title gap in 1994 and 1995 covered Jordan's
year-and-a-half experiment with baseball. On Sunday night, he
looked as strong and agile as he did the night in 1991 when he
performed a wondrous act of in-air artistry and produced an
indelible NBA finals image, rising for a dunk with his right hand
before switching to his left for a layup at the last possible
moment. He hit the same kind of shot in Game 1 a year ago against
the Jazz in Chicago, putting the defender Bryon Russell on his
heels until he had enough room to release the ball _ just as he did
on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a couple of big plays right down the stretch,''
Stockton said. ``Mark another one in the books for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Jackson, ``I don't know if anybody could quite write a
dramatic scenario like that one.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Champagne had been sprayed and the cigars lit, Jordan
was asked more about his future than the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully I've put enough memories out there for everybody to
at least have some thoughts about what Michael Jordan did in his 13
or 14 years or whatever it takes, and put some comparisons up there
for kids to follow and compare themselves to,'' he said. ``I have
another life and I know I have to get to it at some place and
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching the televised replays of his astonishing finish, the
general feeling among observers after Sunday night was: what's the
rush?

 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Ted Williams, perhaps the greatest hitter who
ever lived, homered in his final at-bat in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that home run also winning the seventh game of the World
Series, and you begin to understand the Magnitude of Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Babe Ruth ... Joe Louis ... Jackie Robinson ... Muhammad Ali ...
These are the athletes who defined sports in America in this
century. And now there is Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Now and forever.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird was the first to see. Bird played one game against
rookie Jordan in 1984, then told the world that the high-flying kid
was the best he'd ever played against.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years, and six championships later, Jordan solidified
his stand as the best ever by single-handedly winning another title
for the Bulls. In what may have been his last NBA game, Jordan
Sunday night scored 45 points and snatched an 87-86 victory from
the Utah Jazz with two baskets and a steal in the final 37.1
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when back spasms rendered Scottie Pippen useless,
Jordan willed the Bulls to victory. He took 35 of 67 Chicago shots
and scored 52 percent of his team's points. He outscored poor Karl
Malone, 16-6, in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls coach Phil Jackson smoking a cigar a la Red Auerbach,
said, ``I don't know if anybody could write a scenario as amazing
as that. I think it's the best performance I've ever seen by
Michael Jordan in a critical game.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC's Dick Ebersol no doubt will get boffo ratings for Game 6.
The network milked Jordan dry this spring, making Sunday night
``Must-see-Michael'' TV. In May and June, Jordan got more air time
than Mike Wallace, Morley Safer, and Andy Rooney. The Peacock will
miss Michael.
</P>
<P>
   If Jerrys Reinsdorf and Krause wanted to see what the Bulls will
look like without Pippen, this was their opportunity. Pippen spent
most of the first half in the locker room and NBC reported he was
receiving electrical stimulation to loosen his back. There was
unconfirmed speculation that Ahmad Rashad provided the stimulation.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying 11 teammates and the Windy City on his back, Jordan
appeared exhausted in the final quarter. He'd missed five
consecutive shots when John Stockton drilled what looked like a
winning 3-pointer to give Utah an 86-83 lead with 41.9 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, no dope he, called Jordan's number. It took only 4.8
seconds for Jordan to cut the lead to 1 point with a driving layup.
</P>
<P>
   Utah came down and got the ball into the low post where Malone
(31 points) prepared to make a move on Dennis Rodman (the Worm's
latest hairdo makes it look as if he has a soccer ball on his
shoulders). Jordan abandoned Jeff Hornacek and came up behind
Malone on the baseline side. He stripped the ball, then roared down
the floor, and prepared to win another championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw that moment, and when I saw that moment, I took
advantage of it,'' said Jordan. ``I never doubted myself. We were
hanging too close. I knew we were going to have an opportunity to
win this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw 18.5 seconds left. It was a do-or-die situation. I let
the time tick down till I felt I had the court the way I wanted to.
As soon as (Bryon) Russell reached, he gave me clear range. I made
my shot. Once it went in, I knew it was a game-winning basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah called time with 5.2 seconds left and got a long-range
buzzer-beating attempt from Stockton, but the ball hit the front of
the rim and came out long. That's when Chicago folks starting
lighting cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan again said he'll wait until later this summer to decide
if he'll play next season. His decision may hinge on the
whereabouts of Jackson and Pippen, both of whom figure to be gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gut feeling,'' said his Airness. ``When I walked away
the first time, it was a feeling. When I came back, it was a
feeling. If and when that time comes where I've got to walk away, I
hope that because I walked away no one will look at me any less.
Hopefully, I've put enough memories out there for everybody to at
least have some thoughts about what Michael Jordan did in his 13 or
14 years, and put some comparisons up there for kids to follow and
compare themselves and reach.''
</P>
<P>
   If there are no more games for Michael _ and why should there be
after this? _ Jordan can retire safe in the knowledge that he did
things no other man could do. He made the last two shots of his
career, and stole the ball in between those to deliver another
championship to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   If this was the end for His Airness, a tape of Game 6 would
serve to explain what he has meant to basketball, what he has meant
to American pro sports.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a home run in his final at-bat in the big leagues. And
the homer won the seventh game of the World Series.

SPORTS COLUMN: JORDAN STANDS ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ If this was the end, it looked suspiciously
like the beginning. Michael Jordan against the world, a celebrated
solo act. But even with his odds reduced by age, by Scottie
Pippen's injured back, this wasn't the place, or the time, for
Jordan to surrender pro basketball supremacy to a couple of
reticent stars who only come out to play. Why? The world's most
famously successful athlete willed it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan stripped the ball from noble Karl Malone in the post,
then stole the championship dream of the Utah Jazz. His pull-up
jump shot from 18 feet as the Jazz's Bryon Russell backed away,
fearful of the drive, nailed down the Chicago Bulls' sixth title of
the 1990s on Sunday night at a stunned Delta Center. Stunned, not
surprised, for this was another season ended, another championship
won, as if it were scripted by the writers of Jordan's television
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   In one of them last year, Jordan spoke of repeatedly failing,
but citing his most unfruitful moments as the reasons why he
ultimately succeeds. Jordan made 35 shots on Sunday night. He
missed 20 of them. Then he scored the Bulls' last 8 points, the
crushing jump shot with 5.2 seconds remaining that won Game 6 by
87-86 and finished, finally, the long and winding pro basketball
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, in the fifth game here, I didn't think he could top
that,'' the Bulls' coach, Phil Jackson, said. ``I think he topped
that. I think this was his greatest game in a critical situation to
win the title.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was a flu-ridden Jordan rising from a sick bed to
carry the Bulls in the game they had to win here. This time, it was
Jordan, at 35 not the high flier he was, lifting himself and his
team with 45 points in 44 minutes, with the two end-game plays that
will be rewound, again and again, until Malone and the Jazz can
watch them no more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go ahead, laugh all you want,'' Malone had told the snickering
news media after trustingly revealing how he soothed himself back
in Chicago before his breakout Game 4. He rode shotgun with an
Illinois state trooper, and went off to help weigh trucks.
</P>
<P>
   No more laughing at Malone, at his hobbies, but the truth is,
Malone and the Jazz had the Bulls right where they wanted them on
Sunday night, wounded, stressed, and could not, as Jordan said,
``burst out and leave us standing there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A tough bunch,'' Jordan graciously called the Jazz. Just not
tough enough to knock the notion out of his head, that if it can
came down to him with the ball, him with a chance, he would make
the last shot, no matter how many he'd missed.
</P>
<P>
   He made the shot. He accepted his sixth most valuable player
trophy. He slipped into the ``Repeat Three-peat'' T-shirt that will
sell a few million by the end of the week. And David Stern can now
resume hoping that a more ratings-friendly team than the Jazz will
step up, or grow up, to carry the National Basketball Association
into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, the owner Jerry Reinsdorf will turn into Al Capone
if he doesn't come up with about $80 million to underwrite his
current roster for another go-round. No one will ask why CEO Jordan
can't take $10 million less so Pippen can get fair market value,
especially after Sunday night. And no one will contemplate the
impact on the sport's smaller markets as the larger ones push
salaries to unfathomable heights.
</P>
<P>
   That's what this summer's collective bargaining showdown will be
about, how viable an auto dealer entrepreneur such as the Utah
owner Larry Miller will be in the coming years. How many more John
Stocktons and Karl Malones are out there, relishing the thought of
getting away from the big-market glitz? Most of the kids coming
along now sat in front of their screens on Sunday night, blinded by
Jordan's brilliance. They never see themselves spending a decade in
places like Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   This is Stern's delicate balancing act of wanting his big-ticket
teams to produce the ratings the league can crow about this spring
without reaching the point where too many franchises become the
Montreal Expos. How to maintain interest over the course of a
playoff season that is the equivalent of four consecutive Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The big numbers were being notched courtesy of this latest
Jordan epic _ the possibility of this being his last run _ which he
decided on Sunday night was ``the toughest route we've had.'' The
drama heightened in the first quarter, with Pippen in the locker
room, doubled over. When Jordan exploded for 15 second-quarter
points and a 23-point first half in a shootout with Malone that
kept the crippled Bulls close, you knew he had enough ego to
believe he still could win. You just wondered whether he had enough
legs.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the first half, Jordan twice ignored Toni Kukoc and
hoisted 3-pointers, leaving Kukoc shaking his head, hands on his
hips. Jordan obviously would leave this game to no one, taking
himself back to the mid-1980s, trying to win it by himself.
</P>
<P>
   People for years now have pointed out that Jordan never won a
playoff game back when he was a one-man team, before Pippen came
along to become ``little brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan won it that way on Sunday night, with a little help from
his friends, a brave, struggling Pippen included. Jordan was so
good that he moved Pippen, of all people, to post-game tears. Six
titles in eight years. A team in awe of its leading man, like
everyone else who watched.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they all come back next year _ Jordan, Pippen, Jackson,
even Dennis Rodman. Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   If this is the end, and the circle of greatness is closed,
Michael Jordan stands alone. &QL;

FOUL-PLAGUED LESLIE HELPLESS IN LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - With a dry uniform beneath her gold pullover, Los
Angeles Sparks center Lisa Leslie watched the most critical stretch
of Sunday's 70-60 Mercury victory with the scrubs.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie down with two fouls less than five minutes after she gave
the Sparks a quick 10-4 lead with three straight baskets. For the
next 8{ minutes, she watched helplessly as the Mercury dismantled
that work with a 17-7 run that put Phoenix ahead permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated star turned into frustrated team captain after the
game. Minutes after hearing the echoes of Cheryl Miller's post-game
celebration on the public-address system, Leslie said, ``We did a
good job of fighting back, but we lost our team chemistry and our
game plan and started going more one-on-one. If we could jump it up
and start over, we'd do it. We're not intimidated by them by any
means.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks (1-1) will tell you that they are still getting to
know one another, and that is why their offense looked out of whack
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mercury, which had even more roster introductions held
up by the World Championships, put a defensive hurt on Los Angeles
that demanded credit for the Sparks' 19 turnovers, shot-clock
violations and awful perimeter shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie and guard Tamecka Dixon scored 42 points in Los Angeles'
opener, but they had to sit together for much of the Mercury game
because of foul trouble. When they sat, the Sparks' offense turned
dormant against a mobile, swarming Mercury defense.
</P>
<P>
   When Los Angeles finally got the lineup it wanted on the floor
in the second half, its offense clicked, but its defense allowed
the Mercury several easy baskets.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks-Mercury rivalry was founded on the Leslie-Jennifer
Gillom post wars. It carried on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie got her second double-double (18 points, 10 rebounds) in
as many games, while Gillom put up a game-high 20 points to go with
six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The match-up will probably last forever,'' Leslie said. ``I
can't stop her and she can't stop me.'' &QL;

MARINERS BLOW 3-0 LEAD, WASTE CLOUDE'S EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Mariner right-hander Ken Cloude has pitched
games worth putting in a video collection and saving forever.
</P>
<P>
   Other starts warrant instant trash-can treatment.
</P>
<P>
   File Sunday's game against the Oakland Athletics on the keeper
shelf but don't ask Cloude if the effort was worth it. His best
outing of the season became virtually worthless as the Mariners
blew a three-run lead in the seventh inning and slipped deeper into
the American League West cellar with 4-3 loss in 10 innings before
21,503 fans at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Every run-producing Seattle hit went over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland, meanwhile, used dribblers to catch up in the seventh
inning and won it in the 10th on a leadoff walk, a ground-ball
single, a long fly ball and an error by Mariners third baseman Russ
Davis on a ball hit by former Mariner Mike Blowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hit it, I told myself to run really hard because I
didn't want to hit into a double play right there,'' Blowers said.
</P>
<P>
   He could have coasted.
</P>
<P>
   The ball took one hop and bounced into and out of Davis' glove.
Before he could regain possession and at least attempt to throw out
Scott Spiezio at the plate, the runner was sliding across the
plate, sticking Davis with his league-leading 17th error in 65
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners played the outfield shallow and decided to try for
an inning-ending double play on a sharply hit grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Davis had the option of going for the out at home or attempting
the double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choice was there,'' manager Lou Piniella said, ``but you
have to catch it before you do either.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis sat in front of his locker, commenting to no one.
</P>
<P>
   Spiezio led off the 10th with a walk, moved to second on Ben
Grieve's opposite-field single and to third when Matt Stairs flied
out to Jay Buhner in right.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners figured the percentages were better facing the
slow-footed Blowers than walking him intentionally and having
left-handed hitting Jason Giambi facing Heathcliff Slocumb with the
bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Slocumb took a loss in a game Cloude should have
won.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to get beyond the third inning in three of his
past six starts, Cloude mastered the A's over six innings, allowing
one hit _ Stairs' infield single in the second inning _ and walking
one. Neither of the runners reached second base.
</P>
<P>
   Solo homers by Glenallen Hill in the second, Alex Rodriguez in
the third and David Segui in the sixth sent Cloude and the Mariners
into the seventh inning with a three-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   But for the ninth time this season Seattle squandered a lead of
three runs or more in the fifth inning or later.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve led off with a double and Stairs walked. After Cloude
struck out Blowers, Piniella summoned left-hander Paul Spoljaric to
face left-handed hitting Giambi.
</P>
<P>
   Spoljaric walked Giambi to load the bases and turn up the heat
on the next pitcher, Mike Timlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do my job, maybe it's a different scenario,'' Spoljaric
said. ``Instead of just letting things happen, I tried to force the
issue and didn't do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Timlin did his job, but that didn't work, either.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitting Kevin Mitchell bounced a grounder up the middle
that Rodriguez missed by about an inch. Second baseman Joey Cora
flagged it down, but had no play.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Macfarlane then drove a grounder up the middle, again
barely out of the diving Rodriguez's reach, scoring two runs to tie
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A foot one way or the other on either one of those and we're
out of the inning,'' said Timlin, who absorbed his fourth blown
save in five opportunities. ``When you make the pitches you want,
get them to hit the ball on the ground, and still don't get an out,
it's very frustrating. Weird.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny pitched his butt off and should have won,'' Timlin
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was working for me and it shows I can do the job
when I'm relaxed and focused,'' Cloude said. ``Hopefully, I can
pitch the same way in my other 20 starts this year. If I can do
that, I will be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners lost three of four in the series and five of seven
in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bay Area is just a small microcosm of what we've gone
through this year,'' Piniella said. ``I don't think anything has
worked out the way we expected this year.''

JORDAN REDEFINES BOUNDARY OF GREATNESS IN TWO MINUTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Small as it is, the I Don't Like Mike Club
thought it had a moment.
</P>
<P>
   The ego of Michael Jordan, immense as the Wasatch Mountains, was
finally dragging down the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   As Game 6 of the NBA Finals dwindled to an excruciating climax,
the Utah Jazz had the home court, the momentum, the lead and the
prospect of Game 7 Wednesday without having to face Scottie Pippen
because of an ailing back.
</P>
<P>
   In desperation, Jordan was thrashing and hacking, forcing his
game beyond its already distant limits.
</P>
<P>
   Then the chance for change at the NBA's pinnacle suddenly
vanished. Gone.
</P>
<P>
   In the final two minutes, lightning flashed, the Jazz lay
prostrate on the salt flats, the Bulls had an 87-86 victory and
their sixth NBA championship, and the rest of us are in positions
of supplication: We are not worthy.
</P>
<P>
   Shazam. Or whatever is said when logic takes it in the pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you could write a more dramatic scenario,''
said a beaming Phil Jackson, waving a stogie as well as a goodbye
to the Bulls' dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be the end of the Bulls' run _ but only if
you still are into the Easter bunny and Santa.
</P>
<P>
   As Utah's John Stockton, whose final shot missed by an inch in
forcing Game 7, put it in his usual no-nonsense fashion:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will be his last one. It's been a nice story
for everybody here, but he's not quitting. Phil will be back, and
Scottie will be back and Michael will be back. I am tired of
hearing all of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it works for them, so give them credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as NBC and the NBA have enjoyed wrapping Jordan's season in
poetry and suspense, there is no way the guy goes out now.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody who can do what Jordan did in the last two minutes in
Game 6 is through.
</P>
<P>
   With Utah up 83-79, Jordan made four free throws, a driving
lay-in, stole the ball from Karl Malone, and with six seconds left,
made the game-winning jumper. That made for a 45-point evening and
an even more stupendous finish than the fifth game of last year's
finals between the Bulls and Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   You may recall that Jordan, despite a bout of food poisoning,
scored 38 points to win here and all but clinch the 1997 title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you could top the performance he had in that
game, but he topped it tonight,'' said Jackson. ``I think it's the
best performance I've seen in a critical situation and a critical
game in a series.''
</P>
<P>
   What that says is Jordan has not lost a thing when it comes to
dominating the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, this was a Bulls team weaker than its predecessors.
They gave up on two helpful frontliners in Brian Williams and Jason
Caffey. They had a season-long circus with Dennis Rodman, and
Jackson and Pippen pouted all year about their futures.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls faced a Jazz team that had swept them in the regular
season, had the home-court advantage, a deeper bench, an easier
postseason and an unsurpassed passion for revenge from last season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Bulls did it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the toughest route, the toughest challenge, in the
six championships we've won,'' said Jordan. ``In some people's
eyes, no one expected us to fulfill this, and that was part of the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as (Game 5) ended in Chicago there were some dim
feelings and some negative thoughts. Then I think everybody
realized if we want that sixth title, we have to go through Utah to
get it. Those negative thoughts erased very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   It's become plain that Jordan, Pippen and Jackson have given
Bulls' owner Jerry Reinsdorf no justification for altering the key
ingredients. In recent days, Reinsdorf as well as the coach and
players have backed away from their positions of opposition.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe the fanciful stories of Jordan's $10 billion
economic impact, then Reinsdorf faces a financial imperative to
keep the machine intact.
</P>
<P>
   As much mayhem as may have taken place in the streets of Chicago
Sunday night, it would look like recess compared to the riot that
would ensue if Reinsdorf did not return the royal court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have another life,'' said Jordan. ``I know I have to get to
it at some point and hopefully the fans and the people
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   But that other life probably has another 50 years to go. His
current doings show little sign of decay. As Pippen put it Sunday
night, ``Michael has probably four or five years left.''
</P>
<P>
   If the looks of dismay on the faces of Malone, Stockton and
thousands of Jazz fans were not despairing enough, just lay that
thought on them to see genuine hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the size of the I Don't Like Mike Club, there is a good
chance it will have multiple seasons to recruit new members.

GOLDWATER'S LAST DAYS  
 SENATOR WAS FEAR LESS, FUNNY UNTIL END, WIFE RECALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
``Editor's Note: In her first major interview since her 89-year-old
husband's'' ``death May 29, Susan Goldwater talks in detail about
his final days and months''. 
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You're my wife, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Goldwater was recovering from a major stroke that had
caused swelling in the frontal lobe of his brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what they tell me,'' answered Susan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if you weren't, I'd ask you to marry me anyway,'' he
replied.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1996. As his mental and physical condition deteriorated
over the following two years, he never lost his ability to come up
with a humorous twist or a gentlemanly compliment to cover the
confusions and disorientations of his stroke-induced disorder,
which goes by the name of multi-infarct dementia.
</P>
<P>
   There would be moments when he couldn't quite place Susan
immediately. But he would remember in detail conversations of 25 or
50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He spent most of those days looking out over the Phoenix skyline
from the native rock home atop a hill near 44th Street and McDonald
Drive. There, he had lived most of his adult life _ seven years of
it with Susan, his second wife.
</P>
<P>
   She was a nurse who showed up at his door one day to take his
blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Once they got to know each other, she assumed the task of
finding him a suitable woman friend his age. Playing matchmaker for
one of Arizona's crustiest characters proved too much for her
social Rolodex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what about you?'' he asked her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too young,'' she replied, not wanting to say that he was
too old.
</P>
<P>
   He looked her up and down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you're not that young,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So that was that, and they were married 2{ years later. That was
almost seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very, you know, Barry-like,'' is the best way she can describe
the man she married.
</P>
<P>
   Through most of last year, standing or sitting at the great
picture windows of his ranchlike home, he watched the construction
of Bank One Ballpark in the distance, and worried that its massive
bulk might mar the cityscape. But he loved baseball, so he let it
go.
</P>
<P>
   He built dozens of model airplanes and ships, painting them in
meticulous detail _ a skill that grew less perfect in his last
year. He knew the specifications of the planes and had flown the
real versions of most of them.
</P>
<P>
   His old photo lab had been turned into a miniature factory for
the mass production of these symbols of his highest-flying days. He
had, after all, almost single-handedly remodeled the American
military as the powerful chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Kept busy schedule &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He kept a busy schedule of seeing visitors and answering letters
from his command post in the living room. He went for almost daily
car rides with certified nursing assistant Joel Carey, his personal
caregiver and designated driver. They went cruising for milkshakes
and to see the sights.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got any money?'' he would ask Carey as they left.
</P>
<P>
   ``That goddamned Susan never leaves me any,'' he would quip.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never, ever got too ill to kid,'' Carey said. For much of
the past two years Goldwater used a walker. He didn't use a
wheelchair until the final few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   About six months ago, a change came over the senator and former
presidential candidate. He didn't challenge Susan and his
caregivers at every turn or want to go out for a drive as often.
One morning he didn't even want to get out of bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you giving up?'' Susan asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving up on what?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On just pushing through, being up and about and living. Some
people give up and want to die,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, no! I ``love'' life,'' he said. Susan Goldwater said
that he meant it with deep sincerity. But she believes he was
making a transition to a new place. He was doing the hard spiritual
work of preparing himself. &QL; 
 &QL; 
World narrows &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He became very selective in seeing visitors, preferring to spend
time with his brother and sister and a few old friends and
political associates. His world was narrowing. He stopped going for
rides altogether, and as the months went by lost interest in
answering his mail and even in making airplanes and ships.
</P>
<P>
   The aperture of his world view _ and it had been a wide one _
closed ever more as he curled inward to a world of comfort and
loving care.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a naturally occurring part of life,'' Susan said. ``At
the beginning of life a baby wants comfort and love and nurturing.
That's what we want at the end, too. And that is what we gave to
Barry.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the caregivers really understood what Barry was doing,
there was an effort to get him up and active. They even considered
some kind of group therapy _ for about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was painful to think that he might become bedridden, so we
tried not to let that happen,'' Susan said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gillian Hamilton, who works at Hospice of the Valley,
finally suggested that they simply let the senator do as he had
always done _ whatever he wanted to do. That worked best. &QL; 
 &QL; 
End-of-life care &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Susan Goldwater, executive director of Hospice of the Valley,
was getting a lesson in end-of-life care from another perspective.
She was developing a new awe for the energy and time it takes to
care well for someone, even someone with great resources. For
others, she realized, more needs to be done somehow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't have this round-the-clock support, I don't know
what I would have done,'' said the energetic 58-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``I'm not the average spouse of an 85-to-89-year-old _ the
average spouse would be 75 to 85 and would not be a hospice worker
with all these resources and knowledge,'' she said. ``I can
understand why depression would enter in _ why there would be
desperation and disorganization.'' The wheels were spinning in the
professional part of her mind but she hasn't a plan or solution
yet.
</P>
<P>
   During the last two months, the senator spent more time in bed.
His caregivers propped up his bedding so he could look out toward
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``His Valley,'' the family called it.
</P>
<P>
   He watched political hearings on C-SPAN and some sporting
events. In the final weeks his attention turned to shows about
nature. Often, he just observed the native landscape surrounding
his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He adapted to every new part of his life, even in these last
days,'' Susan observed. He accepted the mission ahead. &QL; 
 &QL; 
`He was not frightened' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A month or so before his death he became more articulate than he
had been in days before. She asked: ``Are you frightened about
anything coming to this point in your life?''
</P>
<P>
   He looked at her with calm surprise: ``Frightened? I don't think
I've been frightened of anything in my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   It was genuine, Susan said. ``There was no question in my mind
that he meant that. I think he was dealing with what was coming,
and I believe he knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was not frightened. I don't think he was delighted
either. He was not one of those people who is going to fold his
hands across his chest and say he's happy to go meet his Lord. That
was not who Barry was. I think he would much rather have lived.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was a realist, she continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were, say, climbing Everest, Barry would be the type to
see the storm coming and know when to tell the guys to go back down
the slope. He would want to keep climbing, but know it's time to
head down. I think he faced that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Barry was working through a lot of undefinable issues
in his own soul during the last week of his life. We watched him
when he was in bed _ he was more peaceful than he'd been in the
previous month. I think he was working things out.''
</P>
<P>
   She walked into the living room one day to see him sitting in a
well-worn leather chair silently holding the hand of his 4-year-old
step-granddaughter, Rebecca, who enjoyed helping the nurse by using
a play stethoscope to take the senator's vital signs. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Happy and peaceful &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those vital signs started on a long glide path downward in the
last week of his life, and the family gathered around. But the
89-year-old Arizonan was, to the eyes of Susan Goldwater, totally
happy and peaceful. She watched and listened closely. He was, she
believes, mentally flying over his favorite lands in northern
Arizona, or traveling those parts again with his beloved mother,
Josephine _ Arizona's pioneer nurse.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of flying over Arizona was a comfort to Susan, too.
Her favorite memories of Barry are of long plane flights with him
over the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would know every rock down there, and have stories about
it. To me, he was a part of the landscape,'' she said. And always a
stubborn part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He, of course, would have wanted to choose his last moment,
and I believe he did. I think he made a decision the morning he
died. I saw it,'' she said. ``He had been quietly winding down in
terms of his vital signs. Then his eyes opened a little and that
blue was really showing. Then he closed his eyes very tight _ the
way he made a face sometimes when he was making a decision. I
believe I saw Barry deciding to let go. I could feel his spirit
just soaring away.''
</P>
<P>
   He died shortly after sunrise May 29, on a day of unusual winds
and cool temperatures. Good tail winds, one might say, for an easy
flight north over the canyons.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks have passed. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hundreds of letters &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are now hundreds of letters and notes in piles on the
tables of the Goldwater home. Susan and other family members have
them sorted into piles: answered, read but not answered, not read,
and letters so dear that they must be read again. Some are just
addressed to ``The Goldwater Family, Phoenix, Arizona.'' She reads
them as a comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Carey is still helping the household cope with the change.
After two years, he has become an unofficial member of the family.
On Friday he was helping Susan and her 35-year-old daughter, Samara
Hutman, sort through the letters from princes and regular guys.
Barry was both, they agreed by the stories they remember as they
sorted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; She will start returning to her duties at Hospice of the Valley
this week, having learned again things she has learned several
times before: that death is a personal experience, not a medical
event, and that death can be and should be peaceful and
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing that can't be managed at home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan will stay in that home for now. She doesn't know what she
will do with the leftover time _ the hole. But she has books to
read, she says. And letters to write. &QL;

2 BLOWN CALLS FATAL FOR JAZZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ When the Utah Jazz looks back at their loss in
Game 6 of the NBA Finals, two plays will be a lot more painful than
 &UR; Michael Jordan's game-winning shot or &UR; John Stockton's final-second
miss.
</P>
<P>
   Two blown calls by the officiating crew of  &UR; Dick Bavetta, &UR; Hue
 &UR; Hollins and &UR; Danny Crawford cost Utah five points and might have
made the difference between another Chicago championship or a Game
7 showdown.
</P>
<P>
   The first came early in the second quarter when Utah guard
 &UR; Howard Eisley put up a 25-foot shot that appeared to be good for
three points that would have given Utah a seven-point lead. But
Bavetta waived the shot off, saying Eisley launched it after the
24-second shot clock had expired.
</P>
<P>
   Television replays showed Bavetta was wrong. The ball was about
10 feet out of Eisley's hand before the clock expired.
</P>
<P>
   The second blown call came at a more critical time. This time,
Chicago's  &UR; Ron Harper put up a short leaner as the shot-clock
buzzer sounded that tied the score at 79 with 3:44 to play in the
game. The replay showed that Harper did not beat the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no control over that,'' Utah Coach  &UR; Jerry Sloan said.
``What are you going to do?'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Preview &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pro wrestling fans might have gotten a sample of what they can
expect next month when &UR; Dennis Rodman of the Bulls and  &UR; Karl Malone
of the Jazz square off in a pay-per-view tag-team match.
</P>
<P>
   Malone and Rodman went at it most of the game, exchanging elbows
and flops. &QL;

TELEMACO TO GET HIS 1ST START IN ST. LOUIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM AND BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Right-hander  &UR; Amaury Telemaco, who pitched a scoreless
eighth inning on Sunday, will get his first start of the season on
Saturday when the Diamondbacks face the Cardinals in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Telemaco, acquired on waivers from the Chicago Cubs on May 15,
has appeared in nine games for Arizona and has given up three
earned runs on 12 hits in 16 innings. He is getting his chance
because right-hander &UR; Bob Wolcott recently was sent to Triple-A
Tucson. Wolcott made two starts for the Diamondbacks. &QL; 
 &QL; 
White misses game &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder  &UR; Devon White missed a second straight game Sunday
because of a strained right wrist. He was available for
pinch-running and defense, said Manager &UR; Buck Showalter, who added
that he expects to have White back in the lineup when the
Diamondbacks open a series in Cincinnati against the Reds on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cool breeze in park &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do you wonder why they closed the roof at Bank One Ballpark,
even though it doesn't seem that hot outside? The first-pitch
temperature for Saturday's game was 84 degrees. The roof was opened
shortly after the game ended, and the temperature in the lower
seats eventually reached 110.
</P>
<P>
   With the roof closed and the outfield panels open on Sunday, a
cool breeze could be felt throughout the ballpark. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Fabregas: Not quite &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Catcher &UR; Jorge Fabregas, eligible to come off the disabled list
on Tuesday after injuring his right ankle, likely will be sidelined
for another week or so.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said Fabregas could be activated later in the team's
eight-game trip, but a more likely scenario has him back on the
roster when the Diamondbacks return home on June 24 against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' Fabregas said. ``I get up every morning
and say, `Today's going to be the day.' I even use the whirlpool at
my (apartment) complex for extra treatment. I have a long list of
exercises. Then I step on it and it's still not quite right. I'm
trying to be patient, remain positive.''
</P>
<P>
   With the team out of town, Fabregas will return to the minor
league complex in Tucson, where the majority of the team's
rehabilitation is done. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Garcia makes nice catch &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With White sitting out the game,  &UR; Karim Garcia made his first
start of the season in center field. In the fifth inning, he made a
nice catch on  &UR; Tom Pagnozzi's deep fly ball, then uncorked a
terrific throw to third, narrowly missing  &UR; Royce Clayton, who had
tagged up.
</P>
<P>
   Another new face _ relatively new, anyway _ was  &UR; Brent Brede,
who started in right field. Brede's role has been reduced since
Garcia's call-up from Tucson two weeks ago, and he had been
relegated to pinch-hitting duties. Both bat left-handed. Brede
doubled in three at-bats and made a diving catch and started a
double play on Clayton's line drive in the eighth. &QL;

DENVER COACH FACING REPRI MAND? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Denver Broncos assistant  &UR; John Teerlinck's next visit to the
principal's office might not be so friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Teerlinck, then a Detroit Lions assistant, was
summoned to see NFL Commissioner  &UR; Paul Tagliabue to discuss whether
he was teaching his Detroit Lions defensive linemen to play dirty.
The meeting was set up after the Lions roughed up quarterbacks
 &UR; Warren
 &UR; Moon,  &UR; Trent Dilfer, &UR; Erik Kramer and  &UR; Bobby Hebert in four of the
first six games.
</P>
<P>
   Teerlinck, former assistant for the Arizona Wranglers and
Outlaws of the now-defunct U.S. Football League, might be visiting
Tagliabue again as the result of a lawsuit filed against him last
Wednesday by a Scottsdale woman who alleges she was raped by
Teerlinck before last January's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, &UR; Shelley McClain, said in the suit that she went to
San Diego on Jan. 18 to meet with Teerlinck about Super Bowl
tickets he had promised her. She claims in the suit that Teerlinck,
after drinking 10 to 15 beers, ``physically assaulted and raped''
her, forcing her to have sexual intercourse and oral sex by
grabbing her by the throat.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed against Teerlinck and the Broncos, is being
taken seriously by the NFL, which has a new violent crime policy.
But Teerlinck is not subjected to being punished under that policy
because the case is a civil matter.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego police said it investigated the complaint and that
``there is not strong evidence at this point to support a criminal
charge.'' But the police have turned the matter over to the San
Diego district attorney to decide whether to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos and the NFL, meanwhile, are embarrassed by the
incident, and the league's showcase event has been sullied.
</P>
<P>
   Teerlinck remains employed by the Broncos, who weren't bothered
by his controversial reputation when they hired him.
</P>
<P>
   He has been accused of teaching dirty tactics at each of his NFL
stops and was fired by the Outlaws in 1985 when he got into a fight
with a player on the team plane. &QL; 
Proof positive &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former Cardinals running back &UR; LeShon Johnson will begin
chemotherapy treatments today in New Jersey. New York Giants
doctors recently discovered he has cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in great spirits,'' Johnson's agent,  &UR; Gary Wichard, said.
``He's expecting a full recovery. Everyone is pleased with his
progress. The Giants have been great to him. It's fortunate it was
caught so quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who signed a free-agent deal with the Giants in the
off-season, had a routine physical before May's minicamp. A chest
X-ray showed that he had tumor in his chest. &QL; 
Another doubter &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals'  &UR; Jake Plummer isn't the only young quarterback
being targeted by the new football league who has little interest
in joining.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina's  &UR; Kerry Collins scoffed at a published report that the
new league, being bankrolled by NBC and Turner Broadcasting, wants
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather stick a fork in my eye than do something like
that,'' Collins said. ``To me, that would be taking a step down in
a big way.'' &QL; 
Plummer said last week he wouldn't consider jumping leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Hold everything &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Neal Pilson, former president of CBS Sports, said he explored
the viability of forming a new pro football league when the network
lost NFL TV rights four years ago but decided against it.
</P>
<P>
   He's not optimistic that the proposed league will be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced General Electric and Time Warner (the parent
companies) have the financial resources and the media power to
launch a new league,'' Pilson said. ``I'm also convinced it won't
work. . . . We didn't find a public or advertising community dying
to have what would have to be minor league football. I think
there's an abundant supply of players but a short supply of the the
kind of players the public expects from pro football.'' &QL; 
Short shots &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bears were so worried about defensive lineman &UR; Alonzo
 &UR; Spellman's mental state, they increased security at their team
facility when they released him last Friday. Spellman's release
will cost the Bears $1 million against their salary cap each of the
next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State running backs coach  &UR; Cornell Jackson will work at
the St. Louis Rams' training camp for three weeks this summer as
part of the NFL's minority coaching development program.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that the Green Bay Packers are the NFL's
richest team. They informed stock holders last week that they have
cash reserves of $51.9 million. Their waiting list for season
tickets is up to 44,000, more than many teams' sales, including the
Cardinals.

D-BACKS' BATS GO SILENT  
 CARDINALS PITCHERS THROW 4-HIT SHUTOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   PHOENIX - The Diamondbacks' dugout must have felt like a cavern
to pitcher Willie Blair on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of echoes.
</P>
<P>
   `` Hello, hello, hello''.``''
</P>
<P>
   `` Is anybody in here, here, here''?``''
</P>
<P>
   `` Can somebody help me, me, me''?``''
</P>
<P>
   Blair gave up two runs and scattered eight hits through seven
innings and struck out slugger Mark McGwire three times. But the
right-hander got no support from his offense, which had averaged
7.2 runs in its previous seven games.
</P>
<P>
   All the Diamondbacks could muster were four hits and two walks
against St. Louis right-handers Mark Petkovsek and Kent
Bottenfield, and the Cardinals escaped with a 2-0 victory in front
of the third straight sellout crowd at Bank One Ballpark. It was
the fifth time Arizona has been shut out this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, who fell to 22-47, grounded into three double
plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you hold a team to two runs, you feel like you have
the chance to win,'' said Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter,
whose team begins an eight-game trip in Cincinnati on Tuesday.
``But we couldn't string anything together. We knew pretty much
what Petkovsek would do _ we didn't make the necessary adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was proud of the way Willie went about things out there. I
know it's frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair (2-9) admitted he was disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that I threw the ball well,'' he said. ``I don't think
I can throw much better. I did what I could.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire struck out swinging three times against Blair _ in the
first, fourth and seventh innings and walked in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key was getting ahead of him early in the count,'' Blair
said. ``I tried to give him sliders down and away.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair and Petkovsek were locked in a scoreless duel for the
first four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Petkovsek (4-3) walked Andy Fox in the first inning, but Fox was
quickly erased on a double-play grounder to third baseman Gary
Gaetti by Jay Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Petkovsek struck out two men in the second and third, and got
another double-play grounder to Gaetti in the fourth, this one by
Matt Williams, after a single by Travis Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, meanwhile, kept the Cardinals off the board in the first
inning despite a one-out triple by Delino DeShields, who increased
his hitting streak to 14 games. A strikeout of McGwire for the
second out was the key.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals (32-35) touched Blair for their first run in the
fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Royce Clayton singled with one out, stole second,
moved to third on a fly to center by catcher Tom Pagnozzi and
scored on a single up the middle by Petkovsek, who left the game
after the fifth because of a cramp in his left leg.
</P>
<P>
   Blair escaped a potential disaster in the sixth when he walked
McGwire with one out, gave up a two-out double to Gaetti and got
Ron Gant on a grounder.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals scored their second run in the seventh inning as
they collected three infield hits.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton, the leadoff man, reached first on a slow-rolling base
hit in front of Williams. Pagnozzi sacrificed him to second and
John Mabry got him to third with a fly to left.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton scored as Willie McGee hit a comebacker off Blair's
glove that second baseman Fox retrieved but couldn't make the throw
in time. DeShields hit another off Blair's glove, and shortstop Jay
Bell couldn't make the play in time. Blair struck out McGwire to
end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably should have had both of those hit back to me,''
Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield gave up a leadoff single to Lee in the seventh, but
Lee was erased again as Williams grounded to Gaetti for another
5-4-3 double play.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's last ray of hope came in the eighth when Karim Garcia
singled with two out, but pinch-hitter Mike Robertson flied out to
right to end the inning. Bottenfield went on to retire the side in
order in the ninth to earn his fourth save. &QL;

THIS TIME IT WAS ALL JORDAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY - His sidekick cried on his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   His coach smiled in amazement.
</P>
<P>
   His mother hugged him and wouldn't let go.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, with a cigar in hand and a pair of trophies on the
way, he wiped the sweat of miracles from his face.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball Jesus rose up once again and saved a dynasty. He put
his greatness on display, a team on his back and a defining
signature on his sport. There is Michael Jordan, there is everyone
else, and that's just the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he should walk away now. After all, it can't get any
better than this. This was Ted Williams hitting a home run in his
final swing. This was Secretariat roaring down the stretch, right
off to the stud farm.
</P>
<P>
   This was the essence of Michael, and his cologne has never
smelled sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   No role players this time. In a blurring sequence of brilliance,
Michael simply stole the moment, stole the championship, furthering
a legend that never ceases to grow and never, ever disappoints.
</P>
<P>
   The layup. The theft of Karl Malone. The game-winning jump shot
for, oh, the 7,000th time. He didn't just break the heart of an
opponent. He ripped it out and stepped on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to say that Michael is the kind of guy that
comes through,'' Bulls' Coach Phil Jackson said, puffing on a
cigar. ``He always comes through. He's a real-life hero.'`
</P>
<P>
   Credit Karl Malone for finding a soul. Credit the Jazz for
making this a series. Credit Pippen for playing through the pain,
lending his presence to the floor. But in the end, none of it could
match the vintage of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the greatest player that has ever played the game,'` Jazz
Coach Jerry Sloan said. ``We just have so many things that are
sideshows to this game that he hasn't allowed to happen, and I
think that's the most important thing. He has allowed the game to
be the most important thing, and the other things came afterwards.
And I think sometimes we have a tendency to get those things in
reverse.'`
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, the dynasty will be deep-sixed. Jackson
already has cleaned out his office. As much as Bulls' owner Jerry
Reinsdorf applies his spin to the situation, he will be reluctant
to give Pippen what he deserves: a long-term deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless something absolutely unusual comes out of left field, I
don't expect to see us back again,'` Jackson said. ``And what a
great run it has been.'`
</P>
<P>
   With six titles in eight years, they are second on the totem
pole of dynasties, ranking only behind Bill Russell's Celtics. In
the process, their victims have been plenty. They dethroned the
Pistons, stifled an uprising in New York, smothered a movement in
Orlando. They beat five different teams in their six title runs,
disposing of Magic, Barkley, Drexler, Payton and Kemp, Stockton and
Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can never see another team in the future being as dominant
as this one,'' Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   While Pippen claims Jordan could play another five years without
missing a beat, Jordan says it will depend on a ``gut feeling.'`
Sometime over the summer, while a nasty lock-out swallows the
league, he will look back on this game and smile. With Pippen
hampered by a back injury, the stage couldn't have been better.
With 45 points _ the number he chose when he returned to basketball
only to trash it in defiance _ the symmetry is perfect.
</P>
<P>
   A satisfying ending, no?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Jordan said. ``If that's the case, yes.'`
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if anyone could write a scenario as dramatic as
that one,'` Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   No, there has never been a finer moment, even if the memories
fill a scrapbook: Jordan cradling the first trophy, weeping like a
baby. His string of six three-pointers and the shrug against
Portland. The bad pizza in Utah that gave Jordan food poisoning and
a forum to score 38 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then there was my rookie year in Phoenix,'` Steve Kerr
said. ``Michael got the ball, looked at me on the bench, and said,
'Watch this.' He dunked on Dan Majerle, and went up court
laughing.'`
</P>
<P>
   Kerr smiles. ``Sorry, Dan,`' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No apologies necessary. Not for a team that transcended the NBA,
a global entity that became so large that even its groupies spawned
groupies. No ending has ever been more fitting for a superstar, and
when it was over, Randy Brown hugged the real-life hero.

JORDAN WILLS BULLS TO SIXTH TITLE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ If it was Michael Jordan's final moment in the
NBA, it might be remembered as his greatest.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan carried the Chicago Bulls to their sixth NBA championship
of the 1990s on Sunday, scoring 45 points and producing three
critical plays in the final 38 seconds as Chicago beat the Utah
Jazz, 87-86, at the Delta Center to win the best-of-seven series,
4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's game-winning shot with 5.2 seconds to play will be
remembered most, but he arguably is the greatest player in the
history of the league because he can dominate a game defensively as
well as offensively.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Jordan defensive gem that led to the decisive shot. He
stripped the ball from Utah's Karl Malone with 18 seconds
remaining, setting up the final shot. Jordan feinted toward the
basket, and Utah's Bryon Russell lost his footing.
</P>
<P>
   That was all Jordan needed. He set his feet and fired the game
winner from 18 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never doubted the whole game,'' Jordan said. ``We hung too
close. I knew we were going to have an opportunity to win this
game, and I just wanted an opportunity to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it went in, I knew that we had been hanging around so
long, it was the game-winning basket.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz had a final attempt, but John Stockton's three-point
attempt just before the final buzzer hit the front of the rim.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago victory had appeared unlikely, as it has so many
times for Jordan and the Bulls. Stockton's three-point shot with 42
seconds remaining gave Utah a three-point lead, and it looked like
the Bulls were headed toward a seventh game in the NBA Finals for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan quickly trimmed it back to a point by driving past
Russell for a layup. That set the stage for his heroics in the
final seconds, and they clinched a championship in Game 6 for the
fifth time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if anybody could write a scenario as dramatic as
that one,'' Chicago Coach Phil Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   It punctuated what turned out to be the best game of the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls jumped out early, 17-8, but forward Scottie Pippen
aggravated a lower-back strain in the opening seconds on a dunk.
Pippen had needed anti-inflammatory shots Saturday to relieve
spasms that started after he took several charging fouls in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen went to the locker room with 4:56 remaining in the first
quarter, and the Jazz took advantage with an 11-1 run and went on
to lead, 25-22, after the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen returned in the second half after treatments, but it was
clear that if the Bulls were going to win the championship, it
would be Jordan who would deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   He scored 15 points in the second quarter to keep the Bulls
within four points of the Jazz, and then he began driving hard to
the basket in the second half. He finished the job with 16
fourth-quarter points.
</P>
<P>
   Now the questions to be answered are whether Jordan has wagged
his tongue for the last time and if the Bulls will return intact
next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be his last (game),'' Stockton said of Jordan. ``It's
been a nice story for everyone here, but he's not quitting. He'll
be back. Scottie will be back and Phil Jackson will be back. I'm
tired of hearing all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz may be back, too, after reaching the Finals two
straight times and losing to Chicago. The Jazz took the lead into
the final minutes in five of the six games in the series, the only
exception being the 42-point blowout loss in Game 3. But it was
Chicago that found a way to make clutch plays in three of the five
games that went to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Utah Coach Jerry Sloan said the final play broke down because
Chicago's defense forced the play too far out on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we did a very poor job of executing the play that we
drew,'' he said. ``John had to take a hurried shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockton said he thought he had made it, just as he had made the
three-pointer to put Utah ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good look at (the last shot of the game),'' Stockton
said. ``I know you never hear anybody shoot the last shot that
doesn't say they thought it felt like it was going in, but I did.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sloan said the game was lost because of Utah's carelessness
with the ball. He didn't specifically cite Jordan's strip of
Malone, but that was the most costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't afford to give them second chances,'' he said.
``With Michael Jordan out there, he was going to make the plays. He
was able to do that, and you live with that. It's a very bitter
pill to swallow, but that's why they're champions. They've been
there. They know how to make the play after the mistake you make
and capitalize on it.'' &QL;

MERCURY DIVES DEEP INTO BENCH FOR WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - For the endless summer for which Phoenix is famous,
the Mercury offers an antidote: the endless bench.
</P>
<P>
   Even without 6-foot-8 Maria Stepanova taking a step onto the
court and veterans Marlies Askamp and Mikiko Hagiwara in street
clothes, the reserves outscored Los Angeles, 27-9, on Sunday in a
surprisingly easy 70-60 victory at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The defending Western Conference champion Mercury, now 2-0,
flexed a depth unseen last season in creating 13-2 and 16-2 scoring
runs to take a 39-23 halftime lead over its archrival. The Sparks
(1-1) got as close as six in the closing two minutes but never
really threatened the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obviously pleased with the W, but it doesn't mean anything
unless we complete it,'' said Coach Cheryl Miller of a game at 7
tonight against the expansion Washington Mystics (0-2). ``It's a
decent win, but we don't want to lose our focus.''
</P>
<P>
   That won't happen, point guard Michele Timms promises. ``We're
too professional to get big heads at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Phoenix failed to sweep any of six back-to-back chances
last season and, because of a six-game midseason losing streak, had
to scrape past the Sparks just to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 13,057, less than 900 below the team's 1997
WNBA-leading average on the first of nine doubleheader days with
the Diamondbacks, got its first look at Michelle Griffiths and fell
in love.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-1 Australian power forward played 31 minutes, many of
those against Sparks 6-5 center Lisa Leslie, because of a right
ankle sprain that limited starter Toni Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie, who sat out more than an eight-minute stretch of the
first half after committing two fouls in 14 seconds, had her
expected production (18 points, 10 rebounds), but Griffiths was not
far back (16 points, four rebounds).
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, I'm comfortable against her,'' said the
25-year-old Griffiths, who has played a half-dozen or more
international games against Leslie. ``Defensively, it's harder. We
haven't built a great defensive (team) relationship yet, where I
know they'll be help behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   That construction will come after tonight, when the Mercury uses
five days off to fully integrate Griffiths, Australians Timms and
Kristi Harrower, and Stepanova into systems introduced while they
were at the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   If Phoenix goes 3-0 into that break, it will be at least a game
ahead of what was considered likely because of the six late
arrivals, including Askamp and Hagiwara. But the Sparks, who were
intact during training camp except for Leslie and 6-foot-8 center
Hiaxia Zheng, could not take advantage of the Mercury's lack of
cohesiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not closing the way we need to,'' Miller said, ``but
we're starting to see the chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Griffiths, Andrea Kuklova and Harrower combined
for nine points off the bench, which excelled even with rookie
Brandy Reed having her least impressive game to date.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams, like the New York Liberty (0-2), would do well to
watch the waiver wire in the next week or so if the Mercury is
forced to make a difficult cut or two when the injured players
recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a nice team this year,'' guard Bridget Pettis said.
``It's not just five veteran players. It's five veterans with a
bench and chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercury center Jennifer Gillom had her second consecutive
20-point game, and Pettis contributed 12. Other double-figure
scorers for the Sparks were Tamecka Dixon, who had 12 of her 14 in
the second half, and forward Pam McGee with 10.
</P>
<P>
   Rebounding was tied at halftime, but the Sparks had a 21-9
second-half edge as they hung within 10-12 points. A pair of free
throws, three-point play and 8-footer, all by Dixon, cut the
Phoenix lead to 64-58 with 1:13 left, but Gillom responded with a
14-foot jumper to close the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I delivered as well as Karl (Malone) did the
other night,'' Gillom said, ``but I love the pressure. I try to be
the leader. We have such depth, that's going to be a big factor.'' &QL;

NO PLACE IN WNBA FOR DENISE RODMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Last night I dreamed the Phoenix Mercury introduced a
new player at Sunday's home opener.
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Denise.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Rodman. Dennis's sister.
</P>
<P>
   Denise is different from other WNBA players. In my dream, she
showed up for the Mercury's nationally televised debut wearing a
lime green pageboy, color by Krylon, and a matching feather boa.
During warm-ups, she puffed a footlong cigar.
</P>
<P>
   Denise can't shoot. Her free throws are iffy. Unpredictable, she
skipped the team's last practice, showing up instead in the company
of two roller-derby queens at a Hollywood body-piercing and tattoo
emporium.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Denise,'' Coach Cheryl Miller said. Her sigh said it
all.
</P>
<P>
   Denise is egocentric, to say the least. But she can rebound and
play defense. In my dream, Denise shut down LA Sparks star Lisa
Leslie, holding the 6-foot-5 center to two points.
</P>
<P>
   In my dream, Denise is everywhere. TV. Radio. Magazine covers.
The media is preoccupied with her. She doesn't represent the image
the WNBA wants to promote, but she generates more publicity for the
league than money can buy.
</P>
<P>
   Does the WNBA need a Rodman? The WNBA president appeared more
amused by the question than intrigued by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how to answer that,'' Val Ackerman said.
``There's not another person like Dennis in any other league.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Denise'' Rodman? Ackerman shook her head and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have enough personalities to sell our game. I did
talk with (NBA Commissioner) David Stern. He said Dennis wouldn't
be allowed to play in ``both'' leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA has a core of stars. Last year's ``We Got Next''
marketing campaign targeted three of them: Leslie, Rebecca Lobo,
and Sheryl Swoopes, who missed most of the WNBA's inaugural season
while pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   But name another star player. Most of us can't _ not yet. The
league is still young. If there is a Michael Jordan of the WNBA, it
is Cynthia Cooper of the Houston Comets, last year's Most Valuable
Player.
</P>
<P>
   The league doesn't have a female Dennis Rodman, and maybe it
doesn't need one.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mercury's 70-60 victory on Sunday, before 13,057,
point guard Michele Timms said, ``We can get by all right with the
characters we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Some never will accept women's pro hoops as a legitimate sport.
The league is an easy target on male-oriented radio sports talk
shows. Fact is, Phoenix is the WNBA's most successful franchise.
The Mercury led the league in attendance last season, averaging
13,700.
</P>
<P>
   The team isn't short on personalities. Timms, the
bleached-haired point guard with a Crocodile Dundee accent. Bridget
Pettis, who started every game last season and led the league in
free-throw percentage (.898). Jennifer Gillom scored 20 points
Sunday, and no one enjoyed the game more. The 34-year-old center
has a face made for smiling.
</P>
<P>
   The largest personality belongs to the coach/general
manager/head cheerleader. Wearing a long-coated, black pinstripe
suit, satin shirt and silver necktie _ Abe Lincoln as Capone _
Cheryl Miller celebrated the victory as no NBA coach would dare to.
</P>
<P>
   On the court, Miller danced with the team's hip-hop squad,
shimmying and gyrating to the music's pounding beat. Then, with the
practiced ease of a nightclub entertainer, the coach took the
microphone and spoke to the cult following, telling Mercury fans
what they wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell you what, Phoenix!'' Miller said. ``The Diamondbacks are
(playing) next door . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, fans began to boo.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' Miller said, quieting them. Colangelo partnerships
own both teams. ``It's all good,'' Miller reminded. Miller turned
in place, her eyes scanning the arena where fans, Ackerman among
them, were on their feet, taking it all in. ``This just shows how
much you love the Mercury to come here! ''
</P>
<P>
   The address was heart-warming, or hokey, depending upon one's
point of view. But those in attendance loved it. They felt
connected, in a personal way, to the coach and to the team. They
don't need Denise Rodman to bring them back. &QL;

PIPPEN HOLDS OFF TALK OF HIS FUTURE WITH BULLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ There's nothing quite like nice, warm weather
to soothe an aching back.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's what the Suns are hoping Chicago free agent
Scottie Pippen will think about during the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen was evasive about his future with the Bulls or other
teams in the wake of Chicago's series-clinching Game 6 victory
Sunday at the Delta Center. But Pippen has said before that Phoenix
is one of the places he would strongly consider playing next
season.
</P>
<P>
   He has wavered on whether he is willing to re-sign with Chicago
for next season, and was noncommittal Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking about that right now,'' Pippen said. ``Give
me a couple of days, and I'll give you and answer. But right now, I
just want to enjoy this moment and get myself feeling good again
physically. I just have to sit back and enjoy this moment, and I'll
just see what's going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen played only 26 minutes and scored eight points in what
may have been his last game in a Chicago uniform. He was suffering
from back spasms that required anti-inflammatory injections
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He aggravated the back while dunking in the opening minute of
the game and twice had to leave the court to get treatment in the
Bulls' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to gut it out and was able to get six, seven
minutes in the first half. I told (Coach) Phil (Jackson) to take me
out of the game. It was just very difficult for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pippen played the final 10 minutes and put to rest a lot of
questions about his toughness and desire. Those questions started
in 1990 when Pippen had migraine headaches during the Eastern
Conference finals and Detroit eliminated the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   He took heat later for refusing to go into a game when Jackson
wanted him to be the decoy in the final 1.8 seconds so that Toni
Kukoc could take the final shot.
</P>
<P>
   But Pippen said none of that mattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not exactly,'' he said. ``I just wanted to get the series over
with. I wanted the team to stay close and allow me the opportunity
to come out and give my best 24 minutes, which didn't look that
great.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for me to try to be on the court and make my
presence known. But I don't want to reflect on those (past) things.
I just try to go out and play for my teammates, and give the best
performance I can and try to come away with a win.''

DE LA HOYA CONTINUES `LOVE AFFAIR' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   O &UR; scar De La Hoya's love affair with the public is moving in a
couple of directions at a rapid rate. Make that an alarming rate.
</P>
<P>
   His third-round victory by technical knockout Saturday night
over
 &UR; Patrick Charpentier at El Paso was a sure sign that he has yet to
reach his peak in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   For all it mattered, De La Hoya could have been punching a beach
ball. Come to think of it, an average, off-the-shelf inflatable
might have offered more resistence than Charpentier, who landed on
the canvas nearly as often as he landed punches. In three rounds,
the Frenchman suffered three knockdowns and connected only five
times.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sun Bowl crowd of more than 45,000 didn't care. De La
Hoya could do no wrong. In part, his burgeoning popularity is
rooted in the growing economic clout of Mexican-Americans, the
dominant demographic in today's boxing audience.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as De La Hoya's popularity soars, he also is moving
headlong toward a credibility gap. One threatens to undercut the
other. At some point, he has to fight legitimate contenders,
instead of unknown Frenchmen and other assorted phonies.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya hears skeptical talk about his record and claim on
being the world's best, regardless of weight. So has his promoter,
 &UR; Bob  &UR; Arum, who often appears to be in the business of selling
Oscar the personality instead of De La Hoya the puncher. Make no
mistake, it's hard to blame Arum. Oscar the personality is making
Arum rich all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there are signs of impatience with welterweight bouts that
have been scheduled for De La Hoya the puncher. There's a rematch
on Sept. 18 with aging  &UR; Julio Cesar Chavez, who first has to win a
tuneup on June 25 at Mashantucket, Conn. Then, there's a
possibility of Mexican Yory Boy Campas in November.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there's just talk about  &UR; Felix Trinidad, &UR; Ike Quartey
and
 &UR; Jose  &UR; Luis Lopez. Arum says he has made offers to Trinidad and
Ouartey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put huge money on the table,'' said Arum, who has yet to
express interest in Lopez. ``I've offered Trinidad $7 million, and
that's a firm offer. I've offered Quartey's people $3.5 million
anytime they want it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are explanations as to why no deals have been struck.
Trinidad is still under contract to Arum rival  &UR; Don King. Quartey
has management problems. Blah-blah, yadda-yadda. Fact is, De La
Hoya is the most powerful figure in the sport. If he really wants
those bouts, he can make them happen. The stakes are his
credibility, which is a lot more durable than either popularity or
punching power. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Briefly . . .
</P>
<P>
   It sounds as if De La Hoya pushed for a Chavez rematch. He says
he has score to settle with Chavez, who said a cut in training led
to his fourth-round loss in the first bout. ``Chavez is personal,''
De La Hoya said. ``He never gave me the respect I deserved, so now
I want to be the first to knock him out. I'm disappointed by the
way he acts, makes excuses. It's terrible to find out my childhood
idol is the way he is. I want to punish him.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya paid a price for wearing that gold sombrero and
matching suit to the ring before opening bell. His fashion
statement cost $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   World Boxing Association featherweight champion &UR; 
 &UR; Freddy  &UR; Norwood _ impressive Saturday in an ABC-telecast victory
from Atlantic City _ has a Phoenix-based manager,  &UR; Barrett Silver.
The hope is for Norwood to fight for big money against  &UR; Prince
Naseem Hamed, although Hamed might back away from a date with the
skillful Norwood.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Danny Romero's chances of avenging last summer's loss to
Albuquerque rival  &UR; Johnny Tapia appear to have improved because of
the cancellation 10 days ago of a  &UR; Evander Holyfield-featured card
after  &UR; Henry Akinwande was found to have Hepatitis B. &QL;

   If this was an audition, Willie Blair passed it.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks right-hander has been the subject of trade
rumors lately. One of the reported suitors is the St. Louis
Cardinals, whose starting pitchers have been racking up
frequent-guest points in the trainer's room. On Sunday at Bank One
Ballpark, Blair did nothing to diminish his appeal, even though the
Cardinals won, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I threw the ball today as well as I possibly could
have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Offering no resistance to the thought was Cardinals slugger Mark
McGwire, who struck out three times against Blair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd take him on my team any day,'' said McGwire, who pleaded
ignorance to any trade talk and volunteered the comment.
</P>
<P>
   When told of the rumors, he reiterated his point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see him in this locker room,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that big of a secret that the Cardinals have been
scouting Blair, who fell to 2-9, despite giving up only two runs
and seven hits in seven innings while striking out five and walking
two. The Cards' intended rotation of Todd Stottlemyre, Alan Benes,
Matt Morris, Kent Mercker and Donovan Osborne has been scuttled by
injuries. Only Stottlemyre and Mercker have recorded 10 or more
starts, and help is being sought.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis got some Sunday when Mark Petkovsek and Kent
Bottenfield combined on a four-hitter, but another starter probably
would be useful.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, perhaps? Probably not. The Diamondbacks almost certainly
would demand a couple of prospects. The Cards likely would offer
Ron Gant, their $5 million part-time left fielder who would not be
a good fit. The Diamondbacks like their own left fielder, rookie
David Dellucci, better than Gant.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa liked what he saw from Blair,
whose ERA has has made a steady descent from the stratosphere to
4.84 after he lost his first seven decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him with different clubs, and he's always impressed
me,'' La Russa said. ``He does a couple of things with his
fastball, a couple of things with his breaking ball. He changes
speeds. He's very competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking all over the place for pitchers. If any team has
mentioned that one of their pitchers is available, we've talked
about him.''
</P>
<P>
   La Russa said he wasn't specifically describing ``Mr. Blair,''
because that, after all, would be tampering. Blair, for his part,
said he tries not to think about speculation and just pitches. And
how do the Diamondbacks feel about it?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to trade him,'' Manager Buck Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who came up empty on a fishing expedition for several
of Blair's pitches out of the strike zone, likes how Blair mixes
things up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changes speeds very well,'' Mac said. ``He doesn't seem to
have a set pattern. In, out, up, down. He knows how to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who also walked, once again seemed exasperated to see a
horde of reporters gathered outside his locker. He believes he
doesn't need to comment if his performance wasn't relevant to the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an individual sport,'' he said. &QL;

PIPPEN HOLDS OFF TALK OF HIS FUTURE WITH BULLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ There's nothing quite like nice, warm weather
to soothe an aching back.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's what the Suns are hoping Chicago free agent
Scottie Pippen will think about during the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen was evasive about his future with the Bulls or other
teams in the wake of Chicago's series-clinching Game 6 victory
Sunday at the Delta Center. But Pippen has said before that Phoenix
is one of the places he would strongly consider playing next
season.
</P>
<P>
   He has wavered on whether he is willing to re-sign with Chicago
for next season, and was noncommittal Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking about that right now,'' Pippen said. ``Give
me a couple of days, and I'll give you and answer. But right now, I
just want to enjoy this moment and get myself feeling good again
physically. I just have to sit back and enjoy this moment, and I'll
just see what's going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen played only 26 minutes and scored eight points in what
may have been his last game in a Chicago uniform. He was suffering
from back spasms that required anti-inflammatory injections
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He aggravated the back while dunking in the opening minute of
the game and twice had to leave the court to get treatment in the
Bulls' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to gut it out and was able to get six, seven
minutes in the first half. I told (Coach) Phil (Jackson) to take me
out of the game. It was just very difficult for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pippen played the final 10 minutes and put to rest a lot of
questions about his toughness and desire. Those questions started
in 1990 when Pippen had migraine headaches during the Eastern
Conference finals and Detroit eliminated the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   He took heat later for refusing to go into a game when Jackson
wanted him to be the decoy in the final 1.8 seconds so that Toni
Kukoc could take the final shot.
</P>
<P>
   But Pippen said none of that mattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not exactly,'' he said. ``I just wanted to get the series over
with. I wanted the team to stay close and allow me the opportunity
to come out and give my best 24 minutes, which didn't look that
great.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for me to try to be on the court and make my
presence known. But I don't want to reflect on those (past) things.
I just try to go out and play for my teammates, and give the best
performance I can and try to come away with a win.''

DE LA HOYA CONTINUES `LOVE AFFAIR' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   O &UR; scar De La Hoya's love affair with the public is moving in a
couple of directions at a rapid rate. Make that an alarming rate.
</P>
<P>
   His third-round victory by technical knockout Saturday night
over
 &UR; Patrick Charpentier at El Paso was a sure sign that he has yet to
reach his peak in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   For all it mattered, De La Hoya could have been punching a beach
ball. Come to think of it, an average, off-the-shelf inflatable
might have offered more resistence than Charpentier, who landed on
the canvas nearly as often as he landed punches. In three rounds,
the Frenchman suffered three knockdowns and connected only five
times.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sun Bowl crowd of more than 45,000 didn't care. De La
Hoya could do no wrong. In part, his burgeoning popularity is
rooted in the growing economic clout of Mexican-Americans, the
dominant demographic in today's boxing audience.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as De La Hoya's popularity soars, he also is moving
headlong toward a credibility gap. One threatens to undercut the
other. At some point, he has to fight legitimate contenders,
instead of unknown Frenchmen and other assorted phonies.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya hears skeptical talk about his record and claim on
being the world's best, regardless of weight. So has his promoter,
 &UR; Bob  &UR; Arum, who often appears to be in the business of selling
Oscar the personality instead of De La Hoya the puncher. Make no
mistake, it's hard to blame Arum. Oscar the personality is making
Arum rich all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there are signs of impatience with welterweight bouts that
have been scheduled for De La Hoya the puncher. There's a rematch
on Sept. 18 with aging  &UR; Julio Cesar Chavez, who first has to win a
tuneup on June 25 at Mashantucket, Conn. Then, there's a
possibility of Mexican Yory Boy Campas in November.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there's just talk about  &UR; Felix Trinidad, &UR; Ike Quartey
and
 &UR; Jose  &UR; Luis Lopez. Arum says he has made offers to Trinidad and
Ouartey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put huge money on the table,'' said Arum, who has yet to
express interest in Lopez. ``I've offered Trinidad $7 million, and
that's a firm offer. I've offered Quartey's people $3.5 million
anytime they want it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are explanations as to why no deals have been struck.
Trinidad is still under contract to Arum rival  &UR; Don King. Quartey
has management problems. Blah-blah, yadda-yadda. Fact is, De La
Hoya is the most powerful figure in the sport. If he really wants
those bouts, he can make them happen. The stakes are his
credibility, which is a lot more durable than either popularity or
punching power. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Briefly . . .
</P>
<P>
   It sounds as if De La Hoya pushed for a Chavez rematch. He says
he has score to settle with Chavez, who said a cut in training led
to his fourth-round loss in the first bout. ``Chavez is personal,''
De La Hoya said. ``He never gave me the respect I deserved, so now
I want to be the first to knock him out. I'm disappointed by the
way he acts, makes excuses. It's terrible to find out my childhood
idol is the way he is. I want to punish him.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya paid a price for wearing that gold sombrero and
matching suit to the ring before opening bell. His fashion
statement cost $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   World Boxing Association featherweight champion &UR; 
 &UR; Freddy  &UR; Norwood _ impressive Saturday in an ABC-telecast victory
from Atlantic City _ has a Phoenix-based manager,  &UR; Barrett Silver.
The hope is for Norwood to fight for big money against  &UR; Prince
Naseem Hamed, although Hamed might back away from a date with the
skillful Norwood.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Danny Romero's chances of avenging last summer's loss to
Albuquerque rival  &UR; Johnny Tapia appear to have improved because of
the cancellation 10 days ago of a  &UR; Evander Holyfield-featured card
after  &UR; Henry Akinwande was found to have Hepatitis B. &QL;

   &UR; THE PERFECT STORM: A TRUE STORY OF MEN AGAINST THE SEA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Sebastian Junger. Harper Paperbacks, $6.99.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, a 72-foot swordfishing boat and its crew of six were
hit in the Atlantic by a violent nor'easter with 120-mile-per-hour
winds and waves up to 100 feet high. The ensuing tragedy is
reconstructed in harrowing fashion, largely through the accounts of
survivors in other boats. ``The result is thrilling _ a boat ride
into and (for us) out of a watery hell,'' Anthony Bailey said here
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PUBLISH AND PERISH: THREE TALES OF TENURE AND TERROR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By James Hynes. Picador USA, $14.
</P>
<P>
   These novellas, driven by the monsters of pretension and
ambition that lurk in the groves of academe, meld post-modern farce
with old-fashioned cliffhanging narrative. ``Hynes is fearlessly
playful, a riveting storyteller and a graceful observer of human
folly,'' Cathleen Schine wrote last year in the Book Review.
Another satirical romp set in academia,  &UR; STRAIGHT MAN &LR; , by Richard
Russo (Vintage Contemporaries, $13), follows the misadventures of a
wisenheimer English professor at a third-rate college in
Pennsylvania. In 1997 our reviewer, Tom De Haven, called this ``the
funniest serious novel I have read since _ well, maybe since
'Portnoy's Complaint.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SOUTHERN CROSS: THE BEGINNINGS OF THE BIBLE BELT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Christine Leigh Heyrman.
</P>
<P>
   University of North Carolina, $16.95.
</P>
<P>
   The itinerant evangelical preachers who swept through the South
as the Baptist and Methodist churches were taking shape in the late
18th century adapted their tone and theology in surprising ways to
win white male converts and broaden their appeal beyond women,
children, and slaves. This is a ``wonderfully told and beautifully
written story,'' Charles B. Dew wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SHARP TEETH OF LOVE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Doris Betts. Scribner, $12.
</P>
<P>
   A former anorexic and current medical illustrator named Luna
Stone ditches her handsome fiance as they head to Nevada to get
married, and flees to the mountains near Donner Lake, where she
takes up with a snaggletoothed boy and a dropout from a Lutheran
seminary. Last year in the Book Review, Maxine Chernoff said this
novel ``relates with considerable tenderness'' the story of how the
three wanderers ``emerge from their emotional wilderness.'' The
same publisher has reissued a collection of Betts's short fiction,
 &UR; BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD: AND OTHER STORIES &LR;  ($11). Whether
exploring the inner life of a girl in labor, a schoolteacher or a
disfigured bus passenger, the writing ``remains very much an index
of one woman's intriguing mind,'' Michael Mewshaw wrote here in
1973.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TREASURE HUNT: A NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER TRACKS THE QUEDLINBURG
HOARD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By William H. Honan. Delta, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of the Second World War, 12 priceless medieval
objects were stolen from a cave near an ancient German town by a
kleptomaniac American soldier. The author, a correspondent for The
New York Times, tells in colorful detail how he and a European art
sleuth turned up the loot in small-town Texas nearly 50 years
later. ``This exciting and often rather touching book'' is ''a very
good read, full of suspense,'' Lynn Nicholas wrote here last year.
 &UR; THE LOST MUSEUM: THE NAZI CONSPIRACY TO STEAL THE WORLD'S GREATEST
WORKS OF ART &LR; , by Hector Feliciano (Basic Books, $15), traces the
fate of thousands of plundered artworks from Jewish collections in
occupied France as they passed from top Nazi officials to
collectors and dealers in France, Switzerland, and elsewhere. This
disturbing account of opportunistic greed and the banality of evil
is an ``important and instructive book,'' Richard Bernstein said in
The Times in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SPEED QUEEN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Stewart O'Nan. Ballantine, $12.
</P>
<P>
   In a creepy death-row novel straight out of Oliver Stone
country, a young woman explains how she slipped off track and wound
up as a partner in a drug-fueled killing spree that left 12 people
dead. Last year our reviewer, George Stade, said this lurid
confessional displays ``an unfailing intelligence, a grim and
bracing humor, an unblinking eye for the telling detail.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONSTER: LIVING OFF THE BIG SCREEN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By John Gregory Dunne. Vintage, $12.
</P>
<P>
   The author recounts one of the many screenwriting campaigns that
turned him and his partner and wife, Joan Didion, into hardened
veterans. In showing how the creature of the title (money) and its
best friend (the star) control the ``creative'' process, this book
``offers a crash course in getting a script through the hazards of
the present-day studio system,'' Larry Gelbart wrote here last
year. The same publisher has reissued an earlier account of Dunne's
Hollywood adventures,  &UR; THE STUDIO &LR;  ($13), which details the inner
workings of 20th Century Fox and the moviemaking ethos in 1967,
when films like ``Planet of the Apes'' were taking shape. In 1969,
one critic admired how the author captured the ''Gothic mix of
greed, hypocrisy, shrewd calculation, mad hoopla and boundless
optimism that shapes American films.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COMFORT WOMAN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Nora Okja Keller. Penguin, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   A young Korean-American woman discovers that her tormented
mother was sold by her family during World War II and forced into a
``recreation center'' run by the Japanese army. Switching between
the daughter's voice and the mother's, this ``accomplished first
novel ... beautifully evokes both their anguish and their love,''
Lise Funderburg said here in 1997.

<P>
   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, June 14, moved Saturday in the `a' category.
</P>
<P>
   RAPE-REVIEW _ They strike without warning, bringing terror to an
Algerian apartment, a Chinese shophouse in Indonesia, a squalid
refugee encampment in Africa or a Balkans farming village under
siege. They are shadowy men with a cause so blinding and a hatred
so deep that they have transformed modern warfare into orgies of
primordial savagery _ raping, brutalizing, humiliating, slashing
and hacking women and girls to death. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-REVIEW _ More than two years before Election Day, polls say
a Republican front-runner in the 2000 presidential race has already
emerged. He is a one-term governor, George W. Bush, who has never
run for national office but has, according to one recent poll,
already overtaken Vice President Al Gore, the popular Democrat who
has been running for the White House for 20 years. By Adam
Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD-CONSERVATIVES-REVIEW _ If you want to know what is
wrong with the movie business, just ask Lionel Chetwynd. Chetwynd
has written the scripts for more than a dozen successful movies and
says he has been frustrated in his efforts to take his career a
step higher. The problem is not quality, he argued _ his films like
``The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz'' and ``Kissinger and Nixon''
have won widespread praise. No, he insisted, the barrier is his
beliefs: Chetwynd is a conservative. By James Sterngold.
</P>
<P>
   NIGERIA-REVIEW _ Nigeria's new general-in-charge, Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar, in his first speech since the sudden death on
Monday of iron-fisted Gen. Sani Abacha, hammered away at the theme
of unshaken adherence to his country's ``international
commitments'' as he sought to comfort allies and serve notice of
his country's resolve to potential foes. By Howard W. French.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-CHINA-REVIEW _ President Clinton's visit to China,
scheduled to begin June 25, is likely to be about appearances more
than anything else. No real diplomatic breakthrough looks possible,
since the United States and China remain far apart on key issues
like Taiwan and human rights. By Seth Faison.
</P>
<P>
   BAPTISTS-REVIEW _ The conspiracy theorists have it all wrong.
The U.S. government is not run by Freemasons. Or by the pope or
Jewish bankers. The American people are entitled to the truth: the
government is run by Southern Baptists, who were recently in the
news for boycotting Disney, proselytizing Jews and, just last week,
declaring that wives should submit to their husbands. By Laurie
Goodstein.
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE-POLLS-REVIEW _ They do not have the academic cachet of a
Harvard, nor will they forever be identified with winning one for
the Gipper like Notre Dame. But many unsung schools, including
those with tongue-curling names like Quinnipiac College, have
discovered a sly way to get themselves better known. They poll. By
Joseph Berger.
</P>
<P>
   UNIVERSE-REVIEW _ Cosmologists intent on understanding the
origin of the universe are faced with an insurmountable problem:
there is no way to do a controlled experiment. By George Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   TALENTED-IMMIGRANTS-REVIEW _ Yoko Ono is one and so was John
Lennon. Alan Cumming, the Scottish star of Broadway's ``Cabaret''
and a Tony award winner, is one, too. Orlando Hernandez, the
Cuban-born pitching ace for the Yankees known as ``El Duque,''
became one just recently. All are or were ``aliens with
extraordinary ability.'' Despite its sound of chest-out,
fists-on-the-hip braggadocio, the phrase is not a description of an
especially poised visitor from another planet, but a government
classification of a distinguished, and human, immigrant. By Anthony
Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   NUCLEAR-STATION-REVIEW _ In the history of bad decisions, the
Shoreham Nuclear Power Station stands out, a single project that
has polarized the politics of Long Island, N.Y., for a generation,
boosted electric rates high enough to repel industry for miles
around, uselessly monopolized the talents of hundreds of engineers
and thousands of skilled craftsmen for more than a decade and
sucked more than $5.5 billion out of the economy. By Matthew L.
Wald.
</P>
<P>
   PSYCH-REVIEW (Undated) _ Excerpts from ``Escaping the Advice
Trap'' (Andrews McMeel), by Wendy M. Williams and Stephen J. Ceci,
psychologists at Cornell University. Drawing on 59 difficult cases,
they gave pertinent details to at least two psychologists with
doctorates and asked what they thought. Sometimes the answers were
similar, but other times they diverged wildly _ indicating that all
advice is subjective, determined by values and culture, even when
dispensed by experts.
</P>

 GM WORKERS WALK OUT IN WIDENING STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, June (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   General Motors and the United Automobile Workers union stumbled
into another showdown, as a spreading strike by auto parts workers
in Flint, Mich., forced the temporary closing of dozens of GM
assembly plants and parts factories.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of workers struck over GM's efforts to move production
to other factories inside and outside the country where costs are
lower.
</P>
<P>
   The auto maker had infuriated the union by removing parts-making
equipment from a Flint factory over the Memorial Day weekend, but
negotiators began making progress after GM agreed on Thursday to
return the equipment. Remaining are a series of financial issues,
on which it will be easier to split the difference in the coming
days or weeks.

   NATO Warns Serbs
</P>
<P>
   No one wants full-scale war over Kosovo. ``It is not our desire
to use force,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stressed. At
the same &QL; 
time, she said she felt the need to send a ``strong message'' to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in response to persistent
attacks on the province by his forces.

   Moscow Aims at Tax Evasion
</P>
<P>
   Getting a handle on Russia's economic activity is notoriously
difficult because businesses routinely under-report their
production to minimize taxes. The government of Boris Yeltsin took
a first step toward improving official economic estimates by
arresting the country's top statisticians and accusing them of
manipulating data to help Russian companies avoid taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund, which told the government it
needed to slash its budget deficit and overhaul its tax system to
qualify for billions of dollars in extra loans, says Russia's

   Abraham Lincoln, Deadbeat
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans last week excoriated their fellow Americans as
a bunch of deadbeats casually running up debts and then
disingenuously pleading bankruptcy to wipe their slates clean.
</P>
<P>
   A record 1.4 million people declared bankruptcy last year _
evidence, lawmakers said, that a tighter law and more personal
responsibility were in order.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans did not mention that one of their party's most
prominent members was a self-declared ``insolvent debtor'' who
would surely have filed for bankruptcy had the current laws been
available to him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1832 a young man named Abraham Lincoln bought a small general
store in New Salem, Ill., with a partner. On credit, they acquired
the inventory of other nearby stores.
</P>
<P>
   The economy was booming, but the two prairie entrepreneurs could
not make a go of it and began sliding into debt.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln sold his share, but when his partner died he became
liable for $1,000 in debts, according to Gerald Prokopowicz, a
scholar at the Lincoln Museum in Fort Wayne, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors hauled Lincoln into court, and the sheriff seized his
only assets _ his survey equipment and his horse. The store, in
Lincoln's phrase, ``winked out.''
</P>
<P>
   As a budding state legislator in 1835, Lincoln introduced a bill
to provide relief for insolvent debtors. But it didn't pass, and
Honest Abe was still repaying his debts ``well into the 1840s,''
said Kim Bauer, curator at the Illinois State Historical Library.
</P>
<P>
   It was so onerous that Lincoln called it ``my national debt.''

   A Hairdresser Strikes Oil
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the march of progress goes past some incongruous
places, like the Alabama ditch where space agency engineers
gathered to pump dirty water through a barrel partly filled with
human hair.
</P>
<P>
   And while inventions may come in a flash from above, sometimes
they grow out of odd observations about everyday stuff. Such was
the case with Phil McCrory, the hairdresser whose salon floor
provided the hair in the NASA barrel, which was being tested as a
potentially quicker and cheaper way to clean up oil spills.
</P>
<P>
   It was television footage of the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 that
started McCrory thinking about oil, particularly a shot of an otter
rolling in a slick. ``That's when the light went off,'' McCrory
said. The otter's fur was soaking up lots of oil _ would human hair
do the same?
</P>
<P>
   To find out, he stuffed a pair of his wife's pantyhose with as
much hair as it would hold _ three or four pounds _ poured a gallon
of used motor oil into the water in his son's wading pool and
dropped his ``test otter'' in. ``In two minutes the water was
crystal clear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the hair on the floor of McCrory's Huntsville salon came
from workers at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, who put him in
touch with Maurice Hale, a technology transfer expert.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the tiny cuticles that cover a shaft of human hair
give the surface tension of oil, which is repelled by water,
something to cling to.
</P>
<P>
   McCrory's dream is to stuff hair collected from salons all over
the country into small reusable mesh pillows that can be quickly
deployed to soak up oil spills. Sounds like a cutting-edge
solution.

<P>
   Over the last decade, there have been significant changes among
the vulnerable women themselves. Women who were the victims of
sexual abuse in the name of ethnic purity, nationalism and
sometimes religious zeal have begun to speak out, often aided by
human rights organizations and women's crisis centers. For many,
this has been a revolutionary change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of women just committed suicide in the past,'' said
Charlotte Bunch executive director of the Center for Women's Global
Leadership at Rutgers. ``That's one very clear thing that's
beginning to emerge now. In this decade, the outrage that women
have been able to raise about the issue means that people are
reporting it. But the truth is that there is also a backlash about
women speaking out. There may be some moments before we reach a
point where there is enough outrage to get the phenomenon under
control.''
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon takes human form in a number of recent accounts
reported by journalists. Take the story of Nawal Fathi, who was
captured by militants in Algeria in 1996, made into a sex slave and
raped by a score of men before being rescued by government troops.
A psychiatrist who treated her said that despite a year of medical
treatment, Ms. Fathi committed suicide at the age of 24 last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta, aid workers were quoted last week as saying that
hundreds of ethnic Chinese women had been sexually assaulted during
the looting of Chinese neighborhoods, apparently by organized gangs
that may have had links to security forces. ``Some of the attackers
said, `You must be raped because you are Chinese and non-Muslim,'
'' one woman recalled. Again, a number of women have killed
themselves rather than live in shame.
</P>
<P>
   Although militants in Algeria and roving gangs of rapists in
Indonesia are Muslims, the phenomenon is probably not related to
religion, though radical religious views may provide justification
to an elemental misogyny.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban movement in Afghanistan, for example, has repressed
women but its holy warriors have not abused them sexually, as their
predecessors in the Mujahedeen armies were frequently accused of
doing, Afghan women say.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Catholics butchered other Roman Catholics in Rwanda and
Burundi. Sex slaves are also a hallmark of the vaguely evangelical
Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda. Burmese troops in Myanmar, a
Buddhist country, are accused in a new report from the human-rights
group Earthrights of using rape as a weapon against women from 20
or more ethnic minorities or student groups that oppose the
military regime.
</P>
<P>
   Because women displaced by ethnic warfare or other forms of mass
violence are often not safe even in refugee camps _ or arrive there
pregnant through rape _ United Nations relief agencies and some
private groups have begun to offer gynecological services and the
``morning after'' pill, which prevents conception.
</P>
<P>
   Although this practice has been sharply criticized by
anti-abortion groups in the United States, the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, and others have continued
to provide help to abused women.
</P>
<P>
   At Equality Now, Franzblau said the kind of sexual abuse that
took place in Bosnia, where Serb rapes of Muslim women were
numerous and intense personal hatred was directed at neighbors, not
some distant stranger at an enemy gun emplacement, makes the impact
much worse and stokes the fires for the next round of strife.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it is going to be very difficult to reconcile these
communities,'' he said. ``How can you move families back to homes
where a mother or daughter or sister was raped by a next-door
neighbor?''

<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ There was something more than faintly
American about the first speech of Nigeria's new military head of
state, following the sudden death Monday of the country's
iron-fisted president, Gen. Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   Much as a new president of the remaining superpower might, upon
taking office after the unexpected death of a U.S. leader, Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar hammered away at the theme of unshaken
adherence to his country's ``international commitments.'' He sought
to comfort allies and serve notice of Nigeria's resolve to
potential foes.
</P>
<P>
   And as could be expected upon the death of a U.S. president,
Abacha's death unleashed a flood of eulogies praising his immense
qualities as a statesman. Fittingly, after the death of the leader
of a great country, no fewer than seven African heads of state
rushed to pay their respects.
</P>
<P>
   From Senegal to Gabon, the late general's peers spoke glowingly
of a man devoted ``body and soul to his country,'' or solemnly
regretted the passing of one of ``Africa's most illustrious sons.''
</P>
<P>
   None even hinted that Nigeria is arguably in worse shape
economically than at any time since independence from Britain in
1960, that there have never been more political prisoners, that
high-level corruption had never been so brazen, or that outside
Africa, Abacha was often dismissed as just another despot
plundering an unfortunate citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   In his own his country, where Abacha was loathed far more than
admired, many Nigerians undoubtedly scratched their heads in
puzzlement over this seeming hypocrisy. But the point that those
who disapproved were missing is that for much of Africa, any
political transition in the continent's most populous, most
complicated and arguably most fractious country _ especially one as
unexpected as Abacha's sudden death by reported heart attack _ is a
cause for major concern far beyond Nigeria's own borders.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa and Egypt may have more powerful armies, but no
African country is more involved in the security arrangements of
its surrounding region than Nigeria. South Africa may have a higher
level of industrialization, and tiny oil states like Libya and
Gabon much higher per capita incomes, but no African country's
economic health is more vital to its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Oil-rich Nigeria can submerge its neighbors in its economic woes
or float them when it is flush. Beyond that, as the world's
seventh-largest oil producer and the United States' biggest trading
partner on the continent, it is perhaps the only African country
whose sudden disappearance from the map would cause more than a
moment's ripple in international markets.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has often spoken of
the United States as the world's one ``essential nation.'' But in
West Africa, such is the weight of Nigeria, with its 105 million
people, large military forces and hyperactive foreign policy that
many would quibble with America's self-designation.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, the democratically elected
president of Sierra Leone, a country 1,000 miles to the west of
Nigeria, who was overthrown in a coup 13 months ago by a
combination of renegade soldiers and rural rebels who invaded the
capital, Freetown, looting and burning all in their path.
</P>
<P>
   Washington quickly sent the Marines to evacuate Western
residents, saving them from the mayhem but doing nothing to relieve
the country's distress. The United Nations, likewise, took no
action. The only country that proved willing and able to help put
out the flames was Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha sent warships to blockade the rebels, starving their
economy, and airplanes to bomb the insurrectionists' positions.
When all of that didn't suffice, he mounted an intervention by
land, losing dozens of soldiers but succeeding in the goal of
restoring order _ and, by the way, Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone's president showed his gratitude by suspending his
attendance at the annual Organization of African Unity summit in
Ouagadougou to fly to Nigeria within hours of the news of Abacha's
death; there he expressed condolences and, one imagines, sought
security assurances from the new team in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be no change in the foreign policy of
Nigeria, because like no one else, at the center of Nigerian policy
stands Africa, and that will never change,'' the bluff commander of
Nigerian forces in Sierra Leone, Brig. Gen. Maxwell Khobe, said in
an interview. ``When there is trouble in our region, we will be
there, because to go absent would mean letting the fire spread.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all of Nigeria's can-do interventionism in Sierra Leone,
and a previous successful, if drawn out, peace-keeping effort in
Liberia, the warm words for Abacha and his nation were motivated
not only by gratitude for Nigeria's contributions to regional
security.
</P>
<P>
   Just as central in the minds of other regional leaders as they
mourned the dictator's passing was the possibility of Nigeria's
disintegration amid an anti-military uprising, revived regional
tensions and ethnic hatreds. Seen from this angle, Nigeria more
resembled another recent superpower, the crumbling and potentially
dangerous Soviet Union, than it did a triumphant United States.
</P>
<P>
   Few African countries have experienced anything like the
devastation of the Nigerian civil war at the close of the 1960s,
which began with a secession bid by the oil-rich southeast. And, as
that conflict showed clearly, no other country on the continent has
anything like the ability to inundate its neighbors with refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha may deserve some of the posthumous accolades being given
to him by his fellows as a great statesman, pan-Africanist or
nationalist, but no leader before him left power with his country
in a more degraded and potentially explosive state. Indeed, before
an officially declared week of mourning was half over, angry
protesters, readily citing the recent example of ``people's power''
in Indonesia, were facing off with soldiers in the streets of
Nigeria's capital, Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   Ghana's president, Jerry Rawlings, a former soldier who himself
twice took power in coups after uprisings and was only later
elected as a civilian, was one of the few African statesmen to
speak candidly last week about the downside of Abacha's legacy: a
fractured and volatile nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say a prayer for Nigeria,'' Rawlings said in an
interview with the BBC, minutes after learning of Abacha's death.
``For the commanders and the politicians not to do anything that
could cause the disintegration of Nigeria, which would take us all
downhill.''

THE WINS OF THE FATHER ARE VISITED UPON THE SON

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than two years before Election Day, polls say a Republican
front-runner in the 2000 presidential race has already emerged. He
is a one-term governor who has never run for national office but
has, according to one recent poll, already overtaken Vice President
Al Gore, the popular Democrat who has been running for the White
House for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't just any governor. This is George W. Bush, the
governor of Texas, not to be confused with his father, George
Herbert Walker Bush, the former president who also lives in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies a problem that is confounding pollsters as they
consider the campaign ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush's political abilities notwithstanding, there is
growing evidence that these early polls _ which also show Bush
dominating a primary field of experienced Republican candidates _
prove little more than that the public has yet to distinguish
between the former president and the current governor. Many of the
people who tell pollsters they favor Bush are actually thinking of
the father. There really is no other explanation for why, two and a
half years before the election, a figure so new to national life
would have catapulted to the front of the presidential field,
pollsters say.
</P>
<P>
   This is no small matter. Polls are a driving influence in
presidential politics, and probably never more so than during this
formative period before the real campaign. The public may pay only
passing attention to the embryonic race now, but polls establishing
Bush as the front-runner pay a dividend in the form of financial
donations and early endorsements, as contributors and politicians
try to be first in line behind the eventual winner.
</P>
<P>
   And polls shape news. A poll by the Gallup Organization and USA
Today showing Gore losing to Bush (50 percent to 46 percent)
produced an article last month headlined, ``Poll Gives Bush Edge
Over Gore for 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which has given Bush _ the governor _ a decided advantage
over rivals who can't claim a president as a parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number is inflated to such an extent that it's likely to
freeze the field, and keep other candidates from lining up
supporters,'' said Mark Halperin, the political director of ABC
News. ``Because no one else is even close to him, it feeds on
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   None of which is to take away from the younger Bush's assets as
a candidate. He is young, 51 (his father turned 74 on Friday) and
vibrant, a powerful presence, a strong speaker with popular
positions on major issues; he also comes from a state that has
produced its share of national political figures.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republican leaders, people who really can tell George W.
from George H.W., consider him the front-runner on merit. From that
perspective, the happenstance of Bush's last name only hastened the
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the public, though, things are a muddle, and
that worries some pollsters. ``We've had to make an adjustment in
our polling,'' said Peter D. Hart, a Democratic pollster. ``In our
NBC-Wall Street Journal polling, we often refer to him as either
George W. Bush of Texas, or governor-of-Texas-George-Bush, as a way
of saying to the voters, `No, you're not voting for the old man,
you're voting for the son.' It is a clear adjustment. We're trying
to get as accurate a gauge as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gallup poll identifies Bush as ``Texas Gov. George W.
Bush,'' while the Harris Poll refers to him as Bush Jr., the
governor of Texas. The chairman of the Harris Poll, Humphrey
Taylor, argued that was enough. He said his polling showed growing
support for Bush and that such a trend shows that voters are
familiar with him. (He was the choice of 7 percent of Republican
respondents in January 1997, and 13 percent this past February).
</P>
<P>
   But the practice of giving Bush a title in polls raises another
problem: It confers a hint of prestige that other candidates
identified only by name do not have. Lamar Alexander, for example,
is the former governor of Tennessee, but pollsters never call him
``Governor Alexander.'' Thus, pollsters worry, a technique used to
blunt one advantage that Bush enjoys with voters might simply give
him another.
</P>
<P>
   There is already hard evidence that at this early stage of the
campaign voters do not know the difference between two career
politicians from Texas who look and sound like, well, father and
son.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times poll conducted from May 19 to May 21 asked
respondents their opinion of ``several members of the Bush family,
starting with the former president.'' Former President Bush is held
in high esteem: 73 percent of the registered voters in the poll had
an opinion of George Bush, and 66 percent of them regarded him
favorably.
</P>
<P>
   The question then moved to Barbara Bush before settling on the
son, who was identified both as ``George W. Bush'' and ``Texas Gov.
George W. Bush.'' In this sequence of questioning, more than 70
percent of respondents had no opinion, positive or negative, of
Bush the governor. That is in line with what pollsters expect for
someone who has never run for president before, and it calls
seriously into question the accuracy of other polls that show him
leading the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster William McInturff said his firm identified
Bush as the governor of Texas in some experimental polling earlier
this year. But if he works on the 2000 race, he said, he would
adjust his procedures for a more accurate measurement of the
governor's standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were doing this for real,'' McInturff said, ``and there
was real money at stake, we would ask people after they pick him,
`Can you tell me a little bit about what you know about him?''' so
you could see what percent are talking about the former
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican voters are more likely to know the difference between
the two Bushes, and Bush's opponents will certainly do all they can
to help voters distinguish the governor from his father once the
race begins in earnest. But there is also a cynical view of the
uses of confusion: that voters who are confused with pollsters now
will remain confused when it comes time to vote.
</P>
<P>
   From that perspective, the polls today are entirely correct even
if the voters are entirely wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a long time to sort this one out,'' said
Stephen Hess, the presidential scholar. ``There's no way you can do
it with showing each respondent a picture of George Herbert Walker
Bush and a picture of George W. Bush and saying which one are you
for?''
</P>
<P>
   Hess sighed. ``I don't know what they can do. We're just going
to have to live with this one.''

 CONSERVATIVES, AS WELL AS LIBERALS, THRIVE IN HOLLYWOOD

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ If you want to know what is wrong with the movie
business, just ask Lionel Chetwynd. Chetwynd has written the
scripts for more than a dozen successful movies and says he has
been frustrated in his efforts to take his career a step higher.
The problem is not quality, he argued _ his films like ``The
Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz'' and ``Kissinger and Nixon'' have
won widespread praise.
</P>
<P>
   No, he insisted, the barrier is his politics: Chetwynd is a
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has a reputation _ though much disputed _ as one of
the country's staunchest bastions of liberalism, led by the likes
of Barbra Streisand, Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg, all
friends of President Clinton (who was scheduled to be here Saturday
for a fund-raiser). The real problem, Chetwynd said, is not simply
what the Hollywood establishment believes but the fact that it
shuns those who dare to think differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no longer a blacklist in this business,'' claimed
Chetwynd, who helped found a conservative group here called the
Wednesday Morning Club and has long insisted that there is a
liberal bias. ``There's something else, and it's called a white
list. It's the people who get the best jobs. And it's very hard to
get on the white list if you're conservative. Being a conservative
here is taken to mean, `I'm not a good person.' Conservatism is
dealt with as a disease, as a pathology.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's political leanings were highlighted last week by the
election of Charlton Heston, the 73-year-old Academy Award winner,
as president of the highly conservative National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Heston said that at the top of his agenda as head of the NRA
would be a campaign of outing the huge number of gun owners in
Hollywood. This public naming would be his way of letting them know
that it was OK to express what he regards as their true,
conservative views, openly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puzzles me, the number of major, major stars who are gun
users and won't say anything,'' Heston said in an interview.
``They're scared it will hurt their careers, but what can they
lose?''
</P>
<P>
   Those views are rejected by many people here. Though liberals
have long flourished in Hollywood, despite the redbaiting of the
blacklist era, so have conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous stars _ Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Mel
Gibson among them _ are known for holding nonliberal views, and
they enjoy stellar careers. And none other than Rupert Murdoch, a
man of deeply conservative convictions, controls 20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   When members of the entertainment industry have gone into public
life, they have more often than not been, like Heston, from the
right. George Murphy, Ronald Reagan and Sonny Bono were all
Republicans. Louis B. Mayer and many other legends of Hollywood
were known for their strong conservative views and anti-union
biases.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go back 30 years, at that time the studios were very
conservative,'' said Lew Wasserman, the former chairman of MCA and
for decades the industry's most influential figure in Washington.
``The liberals only came out after Kennedy came into office, but
I'll bet if you did a secret poll, Hollywood would look identical
to the rest of the country politically. It's never been a
monolithic community, and the only people who suffered were people
who didn't have what it took to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is now dominated by huge, pragmatic companies: Time
Warner, General Electric, Walt Disney Co. and others. These
companies give generously to Democrats and Republicans because they
engage in many businesses in many parts of the world; they often
need government help on many issues.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, money flowing from Hollywood to Washington has
become more evenly distributed between the two parties. The Center
for Responsive Politics said Hollywood's political action
committees donated $1.54 million to Republican candidates and $1.04
million to Democrats in campaigns in 1995 and 1996. That marked the
first time Republicans received more than Democrats. Since then,
audiences here have greeted numerous Republicans, including House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, Reps. Henry Hyde and John Kasich, Sens.
Trent Lott and Arlen Specter and Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple, in this town, the name of the game is making
money,'' said Pat Kingsley, a top publicist and former Democratic
fund-raiser. ``The bottom line for everybody is, `What can make my
movie a success.' People ask about box office, not litmus tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker Rob Reiner, known for his liberalism, is negotiating
with Bruce Willis to appear in ``The Story of Us,'' without any
apparent concerns about Willis' right-leaning views. Even Chetwynd
conceded that dollars and cents come first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing to understand about Hollywood's liberalism is it
stops at the studio gates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gelbart, who co-wrote the play ``A Funny Thing Happened on
the Way to the Forum,'' and wrote the screenplay for the movie
``Barbarians at the Gate,'' said that despite the conventional
wisdom, many entertainment leaders have long held to conservative
views, even though it has been convenient for some people to
describe the industry otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been the traditional function of the right, to make it
look as though Hollywood has been taken over by the left,'' Gelbart
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, chairman of the Motion Picture Association of
America, the industry's Washington trade group, summed up the
attitude here. ``This business is pretty focused,'' he said. ``The
question is, can this idea or this actor tell a story so well that
people are going to pay to put their butts in a seat and watch it?
The idea that there's a test is a canard.''

 LOOK WHO'S LEADING THE COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, June (The Week in Review)  
 (also see BAPTISTS-MORMONS)  
 (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The conspiracy theorists have it all wrong. The U.S. government
is not run by Freemasons. Or by the pope. Or by Jewish bankers.
</P>
<P>
   The American people are entitled to the truth: the government is
run by Southern Baptists, a denomination recently in the news for
boycotting Disney, proselytizing Jews and, just last week,
declaring that wives should submit to their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   The country's highest elected officials are Southern Baptists:
President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, Senate President Pro Tem Strom Thurmond, Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   If some disaster were to befall the president, the first three
officials eligible to succeed him would be you-know-what, which is
a remarkable shift from the era when the prototypical Washington
politician was, like former President George Bush, an Episcopalian.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're no longer out in the cold,'' said Richard Land,
president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious
Liberty Commission. ``We're on the inside now. We don't have to
explain to Bill Clinton and Al Gore how important Southern Baptists
are to the political life of this nation. We had to explain it to
George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   The dominance of Southern Baptists in top leadership is in many
ways testimony to the sway of the South in national elections these
days. If Minnesota and Wisconsin dominated American politics,
Lutherans might be running the country. A majority of the South's
population is Baptist, and of the various Baptist groups and
denominations (which include American Baptists, Free Will Baptists
and the predominantly black National Baptists), the Southern
Baptist Convention has grown into the nation's largest Protestant
denomination, with nearly 16 million members.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Southern states, the big church in the middle of town IS
the Southern Baptist church,'' said Arthur E. Farnsley, research
director at The Polis Center at Indiana University-Purdue
University at Indianapolis, who wrote ``Southern Baptist Politics''
(Penn State Press, 1994). ``It is mainstream culture there.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four decades, the religious affiliations of
members of Congress have shifted, according to James T. Duke, a
professor of sociology at Brigham Young University. The number of
senators and representatives who are members of liberal and
moderate Protestant denominations like Presbyterians, Episcopalians
and Methodists has fallen to 249 in the 1995-1997 years from 335 in
1960. Yet the number of conservative to fundamentalist Protestants,
including Southern Baptist and Assembly of God churches, has
remained steady, rising minimally from 71 in 1960 to 77 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   So who has taken the seats vacated by the liberal and moderate
Protestants? Duke found that they are now occupied by those who,
only 50 years ago, were Washington outsiders: Catholics, Jews and
Mormons. In the 86th Congress in 1960, there were 102 Catholics, 12
Jews and 7 Mormons. By the 104th Congress in 1995, there were 147
Catholics, 32 Jews and 14 Mormons.
</P>
<P>
   So the current slate of ``Big Six'' Southern Baptist politicians
may be more coincidence than destiny. And their religious
affiliation probably has little impact on public policy, for
Southern Baptists see eye to eye about as often as Clinton and
Thurmond do. Such independence of thought is thoroughly Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, Baptists have held the position that people
should be free in their consciences, and that ultimately you are
accountable to God directly,'' said Larry Ingram, professor of
sociology at the University of Tennessee at Martin, who has written
about Southern Baptists. ``You're not accountable to the church.''
</P>
<P>
   After a 20-year struggle, conservatives have saturated the
leadership of the Southern Baptist Convention, producing
eyebrow-raising, newsmaking decisions. At their meeting last week
in Salt Lake City, they voted to amend their statement of faith to
say that a wife should ``submit herself graciously'' to her
husband. Last year, they announced a boycott of Disney because they
believe that it condones homosexuality. Two years ago, they voted
to appoint a missionary to evangelize Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptists are known for what many would call a liberal
tradition of championing religious freedom. Roger Williams was,
briefly, a Baptist when he founded the Rhode Island colony as a
haven for persecuted Christians. As the Baptists spread south, they
preached their belief in religious freedom and pushed the
Continental Congress to guarantee the separation of church and
state.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of this libertarian impulse, Baptists have a
history of breaking away from their breakaway groups. Debates over
slavery, liberalism and fundamentalism have divided them in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the conservatives have solidified their takeover of the
Southern Baptist Convention, the moderates have formed the
Cooperative Baptist Fellowship. About 1,600 churches are
redirecting their denominational contributions to the Cooperative
Baptist Fellowship, though most have not renounced their
affiliation with the Southern Baptist Convention. Yet the
fellowship is one indicator of diversity among Southern Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be a member of a Southern Baptist church that ordains
women to the ministry, that is open and affirming of gay and
lesbian people, that is way left-wing peacenik,'' said Nancy
Ammerman, a sociologist of religion at Hartford Seminary. ``They
are there, not very many of them, and most of them are way
alienated from the current denomination's administration.''
</P>
<P>
   At Washington cocktail parties, said James Dunn, executive
director of the Baptist Joint Committee, people are often shocked
to learn that he is a Southern Baptist. ``I tell them I'm a Bill
Moyers-Barbara Jordan-Jimmy Carter kind of Baptist,'' he said.
``You can see it dawn in their faces. Those are three Baptists _
and all Southern Baptists _ whose faith and religious involvement
is not only not an embarrassment but is central in their lives to
who they are, and what they have contributed.''

 CAMERA ANGLES: WHAT CHINA SEES IN CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, June (The Week in Review)  
(duplication warning: also sent with `i' code) 
 (bl)  
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ The Chinese have an old saying, describing
donkey dung, that pokes fun at their culture's obsession with
appearances: ``Shiny on the outside, smelly within.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking good is important, in other words, even when a situation
is imperfect.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's visit to China, scheduled to begin June 25,
is likely to be about appearances more than anything else. No real
diplomatic breakthrough looks possible, since the United States and
China remain far apart on key issues like Taiwan and human rights.
With the Clinton administration extra sensitive to recent
accusations that it sold out national security for business
interests, no big commercial deals are likely to be showcased
either.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with China's leaders, who care about appearances
above all. Even without substance, the first visit by a U.S.
president since the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators
in Tiananmen Square is tremendously important to Communist Party
bosses in Beijing, largely for the way it symbolizes approval of
their rule.
</P>
<P>
   Playing host to the president of the United States, and doing it
well, shores up the legitimacy of Chinese leaders before their own
people.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, some of China's critics in Washington have
called on Clinton to avoid, at the very least, participating in a
welcoming ceremony in Tiananmen Square _ the traditional red-carpet
welcome that Beijing insists upon. Many members of Congress argue
that China should be punished for its abysmal record on human
rights and arms proliferation. In response, Clinton made the case
last week that sticking to a policy of cooperation and engagement
with China offers more reward than risk.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides of this debate gloss over the larger and far more
important reality: contacts between the two countries are now
primarily characterized by a deeply enmeshed commercial
relationship _ not to mention an array of educational and cultural
exchanges _ that leaves the two governments to play a steadily
smaller and less significant role.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, President Richard M. Nixon's visit to China was
critically important to any Chinese or U.S. citizen who wanted to
do business or even travel between the two countries. In 1998,
whether or not Clinton goes to China will have little noticeable
effect on the billions of dollars of goods now traded in each
direction, or on the hundreds of thousands of Chinese and Americans
who travel between the two countries to work, study and teach. To
them, Clinton's visit represents little more than an affirmation of
an economic reality that is streaking far ahead of politics.
</P>
<P>
   The countless Chinese consumers who sip Coca-Cola and wear
Motorola pagers reflect the commercial ties between China and the
United States that are here to stay, no matter what Congress or the
White House has to say.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the United States were to revoke China's normal or
``most favored nation'' trading status _ a step no administration
has taken since it was first granted in 1980 _ the only effect
would be higher U.S. tariffs on some Chinese exports, while U.S.
sales within China would no doubt continue to roar ahead. Smile
</P>
<P>
   With this economic reality as the backdrop, and with Clinton's
visit concerned with gloss over substance, he and his Chinese hosts
next week will likely concentrate on camera angles.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal, for Chinese leaders, is a seamless cascade of
televised images showing Clinton in one picturesque Chinese setting
after another, alternately wowed by the majesty of the Great Wall
and charmed by the humble kindness of villagers _ and, most
important, standing shoulder to shoulder with President Jiang
Zemin, as they look out on the world as equals.
</P>
<P>
   The nightmare, in the Chinese view, would be an unexpected
disruption of Clinton's trip by political dissidents. That could be
interpreted by the Chinese people as an embarrassing sign that
their leaders are not in control.
</P>
<P>
   Such a nightmare actually occurred when Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev visited China in May 1989. Student demonstrations
engulfed Beijing in the weeks before his arrival, and protests
spread to cities throughout the nation during his five-day visit.
It wasn't until weeks later that the democratic clamorings were
brutally subdued.
</P>
<P>
   Both dissidents and the authorities are mindful of the Gorbachev
experience. Dissidents in China know that when a major foreign
leader comes to town, the authorities are loath to crack heads in
public, making it a good time to get out a message. And the
authorities know they know. So China's security services are now
working overtime to snuff out any flicker of dissidence well before
Clinton's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Such repression and the overall importance that China's leaders
attach to the Clinton visit are measures of how insecure they are,
not only regarding their own authority, but also regarding China's
place in the world. China plays an odd role on the world stage,
wielding veto power at the United Nations in a way that the West
generally views as responsible, even as Beijing is having a hard
time shedding its reputation as a rogue inclined to irresponsibly
traffic in arms and missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   China's ambiguous international stature may reflect a deeper
conflict in its sense of itself. Despite the nation's size and
growing economic power, its leaders mix an ancient sense of
superiority with a more modern realization that China is inferior
to most of the world in terms of wealth and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit is indeed largely symbolic. But looking good is
important when the situation is imperfect.

 COLLEGES SEEK GLORY IN THE POLLING GAME

<P>
   They do not have the academic cachet of a Harvard, nor will they
forever be identified with winning one for the Gipper like Notre
Dame. But many unsung schools, including those with tongue-curling
names like Quinnipiac College, have discovered a sly way to get
themselves better known.
</P>
<P>
   They poll.
</P>
<P>
   What do New Yorkers think about the Yankees leaving the Bronx?
Quinnipiac, in Hamden, Conn., found that by an 81-to-7 margin, they
want the Yankees to stay put. Which president do Americans most
admire? Marist College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., revealed that John F.
Kennedy edges out Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac, Marist, Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y.,
Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Va., the University
of Southern Maine in Portland and scores of others have discovered
that polling people for views on political candidates, abortion or
more whimsical topics is helping them stand out in the muddle of
5,500 colleges scrambling for applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Cultivating that niche performs an academic function, of course,
by training students to gather and analyze the raw numbers needed
in careers like journalism, political science and marketing. But
polls also get a college's name in newspapers and on television.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Meringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public
Opinion, recalls that when he began polling in 1978 people would
confuse his college with the Yankee ballplayer who holds the season
record for home runs. ``Now we don't have to spell Marist and we
don't have to spell Poughkeepsie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 100 colleges that poll or do in-depth
surveys, said Sheldon Gawiser, president of the National Council on
Public Polls. Older polls, like those conducted by the National
Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago and the
Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan, have
long gathered data for government agencies, foundations and social
scientists exploring patterns of drug abuse, race relations and
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Other polls are more local and may be closely allied with state
governments, providing legislators with opinion data and calling
the quarter, half and stretch positions of local political horse
races.
</P>
<P>
   While all these colleges acknowledge that publicity is a nice
byproduct, school officials cite academic motives for getting
involved with polling. ``I was teaching a class in political
parties and voting behavior and a student suggested that maybe we
should do a poll,'' Meringoff said. ``We organized 100 students to
conduct an exit poll of Dutchess County and we accurately predicted
the county executive's race.''
</P>
<P>
   Manhattanville started its poll to engage students with the
surrounding community, said president Richard Berman. But the
school did not mind that a poll might regain some of the fame
Manhattanville enjoyed when it was known as the alma mater of Rose
and Ethel Kennedy. So last year it sampled Westchester voters about
the race for county executive and this year moved on to races for
governor and U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be crazy to say it hasn't increased visibility,'' Berman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of inexpensive powerful computers in the 1980s and
the increasing reliability of telephone interviews have made
polling relatively inexpensive, said Janice Ballou, director of
polling at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University
in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   And for colleges, students often provide a ready source of cheap
labor. Quinnipiac employs 120 students at $6.50 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac, a 70-year-old private college specializing in
business, health and communications, started polls seven years ago
covering politics in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey. But the
school has lately branched out into more attention-getting topics,
finding recently that New Yorkers support school uniforms by a
69-to-25 margin.
</P>
<P>
   One thing pollsters cannot say with precision is how many
students apply because they first heard about Quinnipiac or Marist
through a published poll. ``I haven't seen a poll on the impact of
polls on the ability to attract students,'' Gawiser said.

   Yoko Ono is one and so was John Lennon. Alan Cumming, the

   All are or were ``aliens with extraordinary ability.'' Despite

   You don't have to be famous, either. Abdou Rahman Mangara, from
Gambia, is an acclaimed griot, or storyteller. Neal Hicks, from

the smugglers' ship he was on, the Golden Venture, ran aground _
dazzled his American jailers with tiny sculptures made of toilet
paper, prison towels and tea.
</P>
<P>
   The designation is intended to entice the world's best to the
United States. Thomas May, the major league administrator for the
New York Yankees who handled El Duque's case, wasn't just referring
to baseball when he said, ``You can't be a minor leaguer and get
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, federal law describes such aliens as having
``extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business
or athletics,'' which can be demonstrated by ``sustained national
or international acclaim.''
</P>
<P>
   An employer or the alien can apply for the status. It is a paper
process; no personal interview is required and none is granted.
Despite winning three gold medals in the 1972 Olympics, Olga Korbut
had to submit a dossier six inches thick of awards and
recommendations substantiating her gymnastic ability, according to
her lawyer, Daryl Buffenstein. She got in.
</P>
<P>
   With its frank elitism, the ``extraordinary aliens'' designation
has drawn support from even those who seek to limit immigration.
``These are the kind of people we want,'' said Dan Stein, executive
director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. But
others grumble that the hoi polloi can get short shrift. In
December, the government whisked Hernandez and another Cuban
ballplayer to the United States but left five other Cubans,
stranded in the same boat, in Bahamian waters to deal with the
Bahamian government.
</P>
<P>
   There are more extraordinary aliens than ever. In 1996, the
latest year for which data are available, 2,060 aliens were
designated extraordinary, up from an annual average of about 1,200
in the previous three years. They were granted the biggest prize of
all in the immigration sweepstakes, a green card, which confers
permanent residence, a step away from citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Still more immigrants won visas that typically expire after
three years or less. The visa for El Duque, for example, expires at
the end of the baseball season, as do those of five other Yankee
players, including Japan's Hideki Irabu and Australia's Graeme
Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other immigrants, who can wait years for approval of
permanent visas, immigrants who get visas through employers get
theirs much faster, in months or weeks or, in the case of El Duque,
seven days.
</P>
<P>
   Most applications for visas require evidence that no citizen or
permanent resident can be found to fill the job in question. This
leads to months of review by short-staffed agencies, said Theodore
Ruthizer, who teaches immigration law at Columbia University. The
``extraordinary alien'' designation bypasses the bureaucracy by
arguing, in effect, that not only are there few in the country who
do the job, few in the world can, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extraordinary alien'' is also bureaucratese for ``we don't
know what to do with you.'' The law gives special immigration
privileges to professors, executives and various other categories,
but what to make of Mangara, the griot, or Hicks, the rights
researcher?
</P>
<P>
   Hicks' work visa was about to expire last year when his lawyer,
John Assadi, tried the ``extraordinary'' route. Hicks has helped
lead such campaigns as a 1994 investigation of the suspicious death
of an anti-government lawyer in the custody of Egyptian police.
``Extraordinary sounds a bit flattering, a bit excessive, but we
were really just looking for creative ways to allow me to stay,''
Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   Mangara, the griot, was in a similar bind. ``I can speak 23
languages,'' he said. ``I know the stories of 9,999 families. I can
sing for a half hour. I can sing all night until dawn. In West
Africa, griots are king. Still, I have to wait for the government
to believe me.'' He was declared extraordinary last year.

 THE LEGACY OF LILCO: NO-FAULT FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, June (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the history of bad decisions, the Shoreham Nuclear Power
Station stands out, a single project that has polarized the
politics of New York's Long Island for a generation, boosted
electric rates high enough to repel industry for miles around,
uselessly monopolized the talents of hundreds of engineers and
thousands of skilled craftsmen for more than a decade and sucked
more than $5.5 billion out of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Shoreham even doomed its builder, Long Island Lighting Co., in a
business where failure was long considered impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But as LILCO went out of existence last month after 87 years,
and its chairman, Dr. William Catacosinos, walked off with a
severance benefit of $42 million, it became clear that Shoreham was
such a huge mistake that no one had to take the blame.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if the entire calamity had been caused by a force of
nature that could not have been foreseen or avoided. And managers
like Catacosinos, who were paid extraordinary salaries in return
for their presumed expertise, operated at a level where personal
responsibility turned out to be irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Surely in the course of more than two dozen announcements about
construction delays and rising costs either a LILCO executive or
the public service commissioners could have asked whether the
company _ building a plant four times larger than the biggest
similar plant then operating _ was ready to plunge into the nuclear
era. But the Public Service Commission raised barely an eyebrow
before the very end.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you hold them responsible in 1998?'' said Richard
Kessel, an early Shoreham opponent and now the chairman of the Long
Island Power Authority, a public entity that has taken over partial
ownership of the LILCO system. The commissioners left long ago,
Kessel said. And it's a shame, he added, that they can't be hauled
out of retirement and forced to eat their words. Or sent a bill for
$5.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the LILCO managers most identified with Shoreham,
including the chairman, Charles R. Pierce, were themselves shown
the door.
</P>
<P>
   Catacosinos, who had been a director for six years and had a
doctorate in economics, was installed as chairman. At the time, he
said he wanted to ``give something back'' to the community.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, turnover at the Public Service Commission was gradual
and regular, unaffected by the debacle on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   When Catacosinos became chairman, LILCO had estimated the cost
of Shoreham at about $4 billion. It seemed likely then _ and has
turned out to be true _ that the hardware and fuel for a
conventional plant that would produce equivalent power would have
cost a few hundred million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But Catacosinos fought to the end, firing up the reactor to run
at low power, a step that strengthened his hand in negotiations
with the state for a buyout of the plant. Once the plant was
operating, even at low power, it had a demonstrated value. If the
state wanted to shut it down, then an argument could be made that
the state _ or LILCO customers _ should pay. Ultimately, the state
decided the reactor should be dismantled because it would be
impossible to evacuate the area during an accident.
</P>
<P>
   And the start-up raised the cost of abandoning the plant by $100
million, because even brief low-power operation created substantial
radiation. All told, while Catacosinos was chairman, the price of
the project went up another $1.5 billion or so.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders lost their dividends and most of their capital
investment, unless they held on through the whole ordeal. Many of
them, especially LILCO employees saving up for retirement, did not.
</P>
<P>
   With about a million LILCO electric customers, the price comes
to more than $2,000 for each man, woman and child on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened to all that money? It went from customers to
steamfitters and electricians, as wages, and to people who had
loaned money to LILCO, as interest. Late in the game, some of it
went to the truck drivers who carted off the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the money came out of the workers' pockets. In 1984
LILCO announced a 5 percent pay cut for most of them, triggering a
six-week strike, the only one in the company's history.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Parshley, a former utility analyst at Lehman Brothers and a
longtime specialist in nuclear companies, keeps a collection of
lucite plaques given to the bond underwriters for the plant. He
pulled them off a shelf last week when asked who else had
benefited.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of Wall Street firms did well handling the bonds that
raised billions for construction, he said. And they profited again
by handling the sale of LILCO's transmission and distribution
assets to LIPA, the newly formed power authority, as well as the
merger of LILCO generating plant and gas system with the parent
company of Brooklyn Union Gas.
</P>
<P>
   The new company is called Marketspan, and Catacosinos heads it.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how badly utilities blunder, they are so big and so
important that they never actually go away; they just assume new
names and forms.
</P>
<P>
   Marketspan has a 15-year contract to use LILCO's generating
stations to supply power to LIPA, and an 8-year contract to deliver
that power over LILCO's old transmission and distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough road,'' said Ellen Balzarini, a spokeswoman
for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers local 1049,
which represents the people who climb the poles and tend the
turbines. They now work for Marketspan and are pleased that they
did not lose any jobs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   There are only 2,800 of them now, including contractor
employees, down from 3,600 workers 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, of course, to view the succession of bad
decisions unfairly in hindsight. ``It was an oil-dependent company,
really the only one in the country of any size,'' said Edward J.
Tirello, a stock analyst now at BT Alex Brown. ``Natural gas was
hard to find, and if you believed the scenario at that time, of
$100-a-barrel oil, that made the plant OK. The problem is everyone
fast-forwards to now.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil has been under $20 a barrel for most of the last few years,
and OPEC no longer seems like such a threat.
</P>
<P>
   And a repetition seems unlikely. Utilities do not make
construction mistakes like Shoreham now because they barely build
power plants at all; now most are put up by entrepreneurs, who
favor small plants that can be built quickly. They do not have to
make long-term guesses about demand.
</P>
<P>
   This is small comfort on Long Island. Irving Like, a lawyer from
Babylon who organized the first opposition to LILCO's nuclear
plans, said that around the country electricity prices are falling
because of deregulation and competition. LIPA's exclusive contract
with Marketspan would delay the benefits of competition on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is some good news.
</P>
<P>
   Rates should fall by 20 percent because dividends will no longer
be paid and because financing will be done through tax-free bonds,
said Kessel, LILCO's old nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``It's a frustration. If there are people out
there who somehow want justice, they're not going to get it. The
people who created this mess are long since gone.''

 CREATING A COSMIC MAP WORTHY OF DR. SEUSS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Raepeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, June (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By GEORGE JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cosmologists intent on understanding the origin of the universe
are faced with an insurmountable problem: there is no way to do a
controlled experiment. They can speculate all they like about how
the cosmos unfolded from the great explosion called the big bang,
but they can't directly test their ideas by growing universes in a
laboratory, nurturing them under different conditions and seeing
which ones live or die.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionary biologists are faced with a similar problem _ they
can't rewind the tape of history and study the various ways life
could have marched forth from the primordial soup. But they are
blessed with a powerful fallback. They can study a variety of
creatures and, through the process of induction, piece together a
persuasive story.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no such thing as a cosmological anatomist, jumping
from universe to universe gathering data on how different ones
behave. With no real universes to study other than their own,
cosmologists have turned to the next best thing. They build
computer simulations of the original fireball and watch it explode.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at the American Astronomical Society meeting in San
Diego, Dr. August Evrard of the University of Michigan described
the biggest simulation yet: the entire visible universe, 10 billion
light years across, captured in a Cray computer at the Max Planck
Society's computing center in Garching, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Artificial life (simulating living creatures) and artificial
intelligence (simulating minds) have been joined by artificial
cosmology, the art of creating a universe in a box.
</P>
<P>
   With money coming from many sources here and abroad, Evrard
said, it was hard to put a dollar figure on the project. ``Whatever
the exact numbers are,'' he added, ``I'm confident that the
taxpayers in all countries involved will feel they got the whole
universe for a pretty fair price _ especially when compared to the
cost of building observatories.''
</P>
<P>
   In a mere three days, 10 billion years of cosmic history can be
replayed inside the supercomputer, tended by an international team
called the Virgo Consortium. What results are colorful computer
images showing how the matter in the universe may have been
distributed at various times in its life. Each of these snapshots
occupies 28 billion bytes of memory and can be compressed to a mere
16 billion bytes, small enough to fit on a few hard drives. One can
almost imagine tiny galaxies, solar systems and planets with
creatures clinging to them, like Dr. Seuss' Whos of Whoville,
faintly calling: ``We are here! We are here!''
</P>
<P>
   If only the grain were so fine. The artificial cosmos is more
like the rough simulations of the Earth people have mounted on
stands in their offices and dens. By giving the globe a spin in the
wrong direction, one can play God and make the sun rise in the
west. Though one can see continents and countries and a few of the
largest cities and mountains, there are no buildings, people or
trees.
</P>
<P>
   The smallest things in the new man-made universe are rather
coarse lumps of matter called particles, each representing 10
galaxies. Anything more detailed is washed away. No matter how hard
you squint, you aren't going to find the Earth, the Sun, or even
the Milky Way. The idea is to concentrate on the big picture, by
studying how tiny ripples in the embryonic universe could have been
amplified into the sprawling structures that appear today.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, an earthling, digitized and projected into the
artificial world, wouldn't see a thing _ not even starlight. For
reasons of economy, all that was actually simulated was the
invisible dark matter, currently believed to make up as much as 90
percent of creation. In the grand scheme of things, we creatures of
luminous matter, the very inventors of the simulation, were deemed
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   But as computer power and memory size increase, the universe
will inevitably be captured with a finer mesh, becoming more
detailed and inclusive. One can imagine increasing the resolving
power until each separate galaxy snaps into focus. Make the
simulation finer still and the swirls and arms would emerge. Then
the individual stars would come out. Solar systems would congeal
from the stellar dust.
</P>
<P>
   Why stop at the planetary level? Cosmologist Frank Tipler has
proposed, to the consternation of most of his colleagues, that life
and intelligence are a necessary ingredient in the shaping of the
universe. A true simulation would thus have to include simulated
creatures _ artificial life.
</P>
<P>
   So let the simulated atoms cooked up in the simulated stars form
molecules and cells and plants and animals. If their nervous
systems evolve enough excess brain power, the inhabitants will need
something deep to think about. At some point they might start
wondering about the world around them, and start building
artificial spaceships and probes. They might even mimic creation on
their own simulated computers.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, computer scientist Edward Fredkin came up
with the entertaining notion that our own universe is a simulation
running on some kind of giant computer. Why not have within it the
simulation of another universe, and within that the simulation of
another, and on and on _ a cybernetic house of cards? Pull the plug
on one universe and all those it is supporting come crashing down.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmologists like to tell the story about the little old lady
interrupting a lecture by the great thinker, who is earnestly
describing the scientific view of the cosmos. In some versions it's
Bertrand Russell, in others Albert Einstein. ``You've got it all
wrong, sonny,'' the woman says. ``The Earth is sitting on the back
of a giant turtle.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientist, amused, answers, ``Oh, and what is that turtle
standing on?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Another turtle,'' she says. And before he can interrupt with
the obvious objection, she adds: ``Don't waste your time asking.
It's turtles all the way down.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem with models of the universe _ it's so
tempting to mistake them for the real thing.

 YOU ARE GETTING VERY CONFUSED: PSYCHOLOGISTS' SPLIT DECISIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
   You take it all with a grain of salt when you read your daily
horoscope or the advice columns. But advice dispensed on the couch
by a trained psychologist should carry more weight, right? Sure,
but watch it: Even therapists with the best credentials can(be all
over the map.
</P>
<P>
   That's clear from a new book, ``Escapmng the Advice Trap''
(Andrews McMeel), by Wendy M. Williams and Stephen J. Ceci,
psybhologists at Cornell University. Drawing on 59 difficult cases,
they gave pertinent details to at least two psychologists with
doctorates and asked what they thought. Sometimes the answers were
similar, but other times they diverged wildly _ indicating that all
advice is subjective, determined by values and culture, even when
dispensed by experts.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean $100-an-hour therapists are no better than
tabloid astrologers or talk-radio gurus. But in the end, the
authors say, people at major turning points in their lives need to
seek advice from several sources, including more than one
psychotherapist, just as they would seek a second opinion on a
serious medical matter. Ultimately, the"authors say, you have to
become youz own expert on yourself. Consider the conflicting advice
excerpted below.
</P>
<P>
   _ By TRISH HALL
</P>
<P>
   PROBLEM: My husband allows his 7-year-old daughter from his
previous marriage to sleep in our bed whenever she has a bad dream.
Lately, this has turned out to be every night that she stays at our
house. I believe this is a bad precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Answer No, 1: Kick Her Out
</P>
<P>
   From Barry Fallon, senior lecturer on psychology, University of
Melbourne:
</P>
<P>
   It is just inappropriate for a 7-year-old daughter to be sharing
the marital bed on a regular basis. It is not"normal and will not
simply pass. You have two problems to address; one concerns your
husband and the other your stepdaughter. If the daughter is really
having bad dreams whenever she stays in your house, you need to
establish what is causing this to occur. If she is using ``bad
dreams'' as an excuse to get into bed with you and her father, this
jeeds to be dealt with and stopped. The stopping of it!has to come
from her father. Discuss with him why he is so ready to accept her
in the marital bed. Are there other things not right with the
relationship between you and him? Is he being used by his daughter
to assuage his guilt for not being with her?
</P>
<P>
   Answer No. 2: Let Her Sleep
</P>
<P>
   From Douglas P. Peters, psychology professor, University of
North Dakota:
</P>
<P>
   You should be more tolerant of your husband's dilemma: He has
divorced the mother of his child and now has the task of retaining
his daughter's love and affection, despite potential attempts by
his ex-wife to alienate him from his daughter. . . . In some
cultures across the wozld it is considered completely normal for
children to share their parents' bed. The daughter's behavior is
probably the result of insecurity and feelings of being excluded by
</P>
<P>
   her father's new relationship. . . . You made the decision to marry
a divorced man with a child. Now his problem is your problem. . . .
Try to approach the problem from the perspective of making the
daughter more secure anf you will undoubtedly find that over a
couple of months she will no longer wish to share your bed.
</P>
<P>
   PROBLEM: I have met the most wonderful woman after years of
thinking that I would never marry again. The problem is that she
feels it is important that I support her when she disciplines my
two children. I cringe when she does this, as I feel she is
overstepping her role in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Answer No. 1: Discipline the Kids
</P>
<P>
   From Ross Vasta, psychology professor, State University of New
York:
</P>
<P>
   First of all, stop cringing. It is perfectly reasonable for your
new wife to expect your children to view her as a parent, which
includes some responsibility for their discipline. Second, a
problem exists here only if you and she have markedly different
philosophies on child-rearing. If you do, you might take this
opportunity to re-evaluate your family rule structure. . . . In
short, view your new wife as an ally rather than an alien, and many
of your concerns will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Answer No. 2: Discipline Her
</P>
<P>
   From Jay Belsky, professor, Pennsylvania State University
department of human development: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However much you are attracted to and attached to this woman,
you cannot lose sight of your obligations as a parent to your
children. If your friend's parenting makes you cringe, you would be
negligent to do nothing. . . . Make it clear that you want her to
become a parent figure to your children, but that parenting works
best when a couple functions as a team. This means sharing ideas
and if necessary compromising rather than having things all your
way. . . . But make it a point to talk about your concerns, and
hers, out of earshot of the children.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROBLEM: We are a large, close-knit group of siblings whose
father just died. The youngest, my sister, lives 3,000 miles away
and is 8 months pregnant. Our doctor told us about the many
potentially negative effects of stress in the last trimester of
pregnancy. . . . Do we tell my sister that her father has just
died, knowing (a) that she will be unable to attend the funeral
(airlines and her pediatrician will not allow her to fly); (b) that
such news could have negative effects on the fetus, and (c) that as
the youngest child who was very close to her father, she may feel
intense anger at having been excluded?
</P>
<P>
   Answer No. 1: Keep Her in the Dark
</P>
<P>
   From Peters:
</P>
<P>
   I strongly favor delaying telling your sister until after she
delivers her baby. . . . Your sister's baby has a right to be born
as healthy as possible, and this takes precedence over all other
considerations. None of us would condone a pregnant woman taking
drugs that would have an adverse impact on this unborn child's
life, and none of us ought to overlook this unborn child's right to
be born free from preventable stress-related complications.
</P>
<P>
   Answer No. 2: Tell Her
</P>
<P>
   From Gerald P. Koocher, Ph.D., associate professor of
psychiatry, Harvard Medical School:
</P>
<P>
   If you value the closeness of your family and respect your
sister, don't exclude her at this critical time. There are lots of
things that might cause emotional stress to a pregnant woman. Most
of them are not under anyone's control. Wouldn't it be better to
draw her into a supportive circle of family? Imagine how she would
feel if she inadvertently heard the news from some source outside
the family. . . . She should also be invited to become actively
involved in the funeral activities. She may not be able to attend,
but she can certainly be in touch with the family by telephone. She
can be invited to put thoughts on paper so they can be shared with
mourners. The funeral or memorial service could be captured on
videotape, allowing her to experience it if she wishes.
</P>
<P>
   PROBLEM: I am a 30-year-old man who has been dating a
32-year-old woman for three years. I care for this woman very much,
but she is from a working-class family, whereas I am from an
upper-middle-class family. She is uneducated, she does not speak
grammatically, and in general she does not show the signs of a
solid education so valued in my family. Last week this woman's
father gave us an ultimatum: Either we get married by Christmas or
she must break up with me. The trouble is, I do not feel ready for
marriage! But I do not want to lose her either, and I have to make
a choice.
</P>
<P>
   Answer No. 1: Dump Her
</P>
<P>
   From Melanie Anson, instructor, Citrus Community College,
California:
</P>
<P>
   After three years one should be ready to make a rational and
emotional decision to be with a person in a marriage or mutually
agreeable partnership. This man is not really interested in being
with this woman except for convenience, because her grammatical
errors and socioeconomic level still visibly disturb him. Thus, it
is only fair to her to let her go free. Her father is right.
</P>
<P>
   Answer No. 2: Dump Her Father
</P>
<P>
   From David F. Ross, assistant psychology professor, University
of Tennessee:
</P>
<P>
   I don't care if she is formally educated _ that should be
irrelevant to the decision to continue in the relationship. . . . I
think this young couple should tell the father to go to hell. . . .
If she doesn't have the guts to stand up to her father, I think
this man should leave her because she isn't right for him. I hate
families who meddle in the lives of their grown children.

   1. JOHN GLENN FOR THE SPACE AGE John Glenn will be 77 when he
makes his sec[~nd spaceflight. To some, it's a political payoff.
John Glenn himself says he's returning to space to promote research
on aging. His trip is undoubtedly a publicity stunt - but trading
on nostalgia is only one aspect of the NASA project. For 10
weightless days, Glenn will subject himself to a marathon of
geriatic experimentation. By Thomas Mallon. From The New York Times
Magazine. 2,000 words.

reassuring it can be. By Charles McGrath. From The New York Times

COSMIC CLUTTER This time of year, one can see a slew of manmade
objects slowly crisscrossing the heavens. They weren't visible two
months ago, and they won't be around after August. But they are
here now during satellite season, when Earth's northern axis tilts
just 5 degrees from its maximum sunward extreme. By Bob Berman.

AMERICANIZING ASIA? It is presumptuous to think the Asian financial
crisis foretells Asian acceptance of American ways. The Asian
economies holding up the best may be those with the most political
freedom, but the real key may be competent government. East Asia is
changing, but not Americanizing. By Donald K. Emmerson. From
Foreign Affairs magazine. 1,300 words.

permanent damage to hearing. Unlike normal age-related hearing
loss, damage caused by exposure to high noise levels cannot be
corrected with a hearing aid. But exactly how does the damage

the changes that go on in the ear after exposure to loud noises. By

WOULD PATIENTS DO BETTER IF THEY LOWERED THEIR BLOOD
</P>
<P>
   PRESSURE EVEN FURTHER? In a large study published in this week's
Lancet, researchers found that lowering a patient's blood pressure
slightly lower, to 140/85, provided more protection against the
complications of hypertension than did lowering it to 140/90, but
that lowering it further, below 140/85, provided no additional
benefit. In addition, the researchers found that with the newer
medications used in this study, this level of blood pressure
reduction could be easily achieved in most of the patients. By
Michael McCarthy. The Lancet News Service. 1,000 words.

 &HT;    Baptists turn back clock on American family life
 &HT;    (ATTN: Editorial, opinion page editors)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By TOM TEEPEN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My parents taught me it is best not to fuss at other folks'
religions and that's still good advice, but, Lord, it's difficult
to stick to when the Southern Baptist Convention gets together.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Baptists, the nation's largest Protestant
denomination, have been marching deeper into theological
conservatism throughout the 1980s and '90s _and typically deeper
into political conservatism as well _ and this year, going
head-to-head with the hardly liberal Mormons of Salt Lake City,
they seem to have broken through conservatism into outright
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its Baptist Faith and Message, the denomination's
basic grid of religious beliefs, the convention adopted a
declaration on family life that few of us outside the religion can
read as anything much better than a demand for domestic feudalism.
You can guess who get to be the serfs.
</P>
<P>
   The statement declares that while husbands and wives are equal
before God, wives must ``submit graciously'' to the leadership of
their husbands _ ``even as the church willingly submits to the
headship of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Husbands, then, are in effect the homebody analogues of the
godhead, a status few of us have dared openly to assert, however
much privately we may have thought it so.
</P>
<P>
   Baptists are an independent lot, almost instinctively
anti-dogma, and are capable of a good bit of doctrinal unruliness,
but where it can _ in its publications and seminaries, for instance
_ the convention's leadership has been firmly enforcing its
deepening pre-modernism. The line is thus being pounded home on
ever more pulpits.
</P>
<P>
   That has both personal and public consequences. The new family
policy amounts to an attempt to enforce theologically what can no
longer be enforced legally _ a version of the old Head and Master
laws, which lasted into the 1980s in some states and gave husbands,
as legal heads of their households, control of all family assets.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine Baptist marriages that are happy on
whatever basis giving this new injunction a second thought, so no
harm done there. But it is not difficult to imagine the imperative
being taken up by precisely the sort of husbands who should not be
trusted with it. Expect damage.
</P>
<P>
   And because religious attitudes flow into the social hubbub from
which we extract public policy, the Baptist declaration is bound to
turn up in politics, adding, for example, to the push already under
way to repeal no-fault divorce and enact so-called covenant
marriages, together an attempt to return to days when marriages
were based as much on coercion as on mutual consent.
</P>
<P>
   The convention was responding to what it sees as a crisis in
American family life. That crisis is less clear to others. Yes, a
bit more than four in 10 marriages will end in divorce. That's too
many. But the rate has declined about 15 percent from its high in
1980, and many divorces _ at last count, nearly half _ involve no
minor children and thus amount to private matters, often personally
painful but relatively free of social consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Argue that one whichever way you like. Either way, it is hard to
see how American family life would be uplifted by basing it on
power instead of partnership.

   Barcelona is a walker's paradise, especially this time of year.
To saunter through its Gothic Quarter, along the dark, narrow
streets and past the ancient artisans' shops, is to be transported
back to the Middle Ages. Walk up Passeig de Gracia, past the chic
boutiques and the daring, whimsical buildings by Antonio Gaudi,
Barcelona's favorite architectural son, and it is easy to
appreciate why this city is known as Spain's capital of design.

   It's a love affair that may have started in a Paris bistro or a
cafe in Tuscany _ the love affair, that is, between an American
traveler and European wines, writes New York-based free-lance
writer Everett Potter. For those enamored of the grape, there are
wine tours that show off the best of Europe's vineyards and
wineries. Potter offers a taste in this feature.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Barcelona is a walker's paradise, especially in spring. It has
old and new, sea and mountain, postmodern and primitive.
 &HT;    To saunter through its Gothic Quarter, along the dark, narrow
streets and past the ancient artisans' shops, is to be transported
back to the Middle Ages. Walk up Passeig de Gracia, past the chic
boutiques and the daring, whimsical buildings by Antonio Gaudi,
Barcelona's favorite architectural son, and it is easy to
appreciate why this city is known as Spain's capital of design.
 &HT;    And, of course, there is Las Ramblas, the city's most famous
thoroughfare, where people gawk for hours at performance artists,
portrait painters, parrots on sale and the parade of pedestrians.
 &HT;    This city spruced itself up considerably for the 1992 Olympic
Summer Games, a face lift that is still paying off.
 &HT;    Dozens of old factories and seedy restaurants that blocked
access to the waterfront were torn down, creating a Mediterranean
beach marvelous for strolling and sunbathing.
 &HT;    After 40 years in which Franco repressed Barcelona, the Catalan
language and the culture of the region, this proud city has
strained to make Catalan culture flourish again.
 &HT;    Scores of townspeople dance the traditional Sardana on Sunday
mornings in front of the 14th-century Cathedral. In 1995, the city
opened the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art, a glistening white
sun-drenched building designed by the American Richard Meier.
 &HT;    And the government has put together a delightful walking tour,
the Ruta de Modernisme, to showcase Gaudi and other
turn-of-the-century architects in the Modernist school who used
themes from myth and nature to take design in a new direction.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art is staging an
exhibition through June 21 of the works of a fast-rising Majorcan
artist, Miquel Barcelo.
 &HT;    His kinetic canvases cover a vast range of subjects: Saharan
landscapes, sumptuous feasts, African flood victims, portraits of
friends and animal carcasses.
 &HT;    The museum, 1 Placa dels Angels, (34-93) 412-0810, is open
Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday noon to 8 p.m., Saturday 10
a.m. to 8 p.m.; Sunday 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Admission: $4.70,
calculated at 149 pesetas to the dollar.
 &HT;    After years of renovation, the National Museum of Catalan Art,
which served as the National Palace in the 1929 World's Fair,
recently reopened.
 &HT;    The museum, in Montjuic Park, has a spectacular collection of
12th- and 13th-century frescoes and altarpieces moved from remote
churches in the Pyrenees. (34-93) 423-7199. Open Tuesday to
Saturday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., Thursday until 9:30 p.m., and Sunday
until 2:30 p.m.; $5.
 &HT;    One of the biggest festivals each year is the Night of Saint
John (also called Midsummer's Night), which falls on June 23. In
small towns throughout Catalonia, people build huge pyres of old
furniture and wood shavings and then jump over the embers seven
times.
 &HT;    In Barcelona, there is a fireworks display and all-night party
with music on Montjuic.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The Gothic Quarter resembles a maze, with surprises wherever one
turns. On torrid summer days, the Cathedral's well-shaded cloister,
with its cool stone and many plants, is the perfect escape.
 &HT;    Cavelike bars, with sausages hanging from the ceiling, look like
they came straight out of a Cervantes novel.
 &HT;    The romantic should not miss two well-preserved squares: the
Placa del Pi, known for its cafes and guitar-strumming troubadors,
and the Placa de Sant Felipe Neri, an oasis of serenity with a
gentle fountain.
 &HT;    The Museum of the History of the City, housed in a 14th-century
mansion on Placa del Rei, (34-93) 315-1111, is full of wonders:
excavations of Roman ruins and a 17th-century six-story watchtower
from which guardsmen studied the sea for enemy ships. Summer hours:
Tuesday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., Sunday to 2 p.m. $3.30.
 &HT;    A five-minute walk from the museum is the soaring, stark Church
of Santa Maria del Mar, on Placa de Santa Maria, a 14th-century
structure with spectacular nave and columns. Unfortunately, its
ornate decorations were destroyed during the Spanish Civil War.
 &HT;    Those thirsting to see Gaudi works can buy a $10 Ruta de
Modernisme pass at the Center of Modernism, 35 Passeig de Gracia,
(34-93) 488-0139, a turn-of-the-century mansion designed by Lluis
Domenech i Montaner with breathtaking murals and a florid
stained-glass wall.
 &HT;    The pass provides admission to 10 Modernist buildings, including
Casa Batllo, 43 Passeig de Gracia, a Gaudi town house that looks
like a fairy-tale structure, and Casa Mila, 92 Passeig de Gracia, a
Gaudi apartment building famous for its undulating walls resembling
seaside cliffs, and phantom-shaped air ducts and chimneys.
 &HT;    It also includes admission to the Temple of the Sagrada Familia,
at 401 Mallorca, (34-93) 455-0247, the vast still-unfinished church
that Gaudi worked on for 43 years before his death in 1926. He is
buried in the crypt. Open daily 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.
 &HT;    Gaudi lovers should not miss Guell Park, on Calle Olot, an
unfinished work that he designed to be a model community. It has a
brilliantly colored, serpentine mosaic bench, an outdoor hall of
stately columns and two guardhouses inspired by Hansel and Gretel.
Open daily from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Two single beds are customary in Barcelona, so those who prefer
a double bed should ask for one. Prices below do not include the 7
percent tax.
 &HT;    With many rooms facing the Cathedral, the Hotel Colon, a
charming, classical 147-room establishment, is ideally situated.
Doubles are $155. 7 Avenida de la Catedral; (34-93) 301-1404, fax
(34-93) 317-2915.
 &HT;    The elegant Duques de la Bergara, in a handsome Modernist
mansion near the Placa Catalunya, the city's main square, recently
expanded to 150 rooms when its owners bought an adjacent building.
Doubles cost $140. 11 Bergara; (34-93) 301-5151, fax (34-93)
317-3442.
 &HT;    Budget: A block from the Cathedral, the Regencia Colon is a
hospitable 55-room hotel with doubles at $97. 13 Sagristans;
(34-93) 318-9858, fax (34-93) 317-2822.
 &HT;    With doubles costing just $40, the 40-room Hotel Jardi is a
bargain, with many rooms facing the romantic Placa del Pi and Placa
Sant Josep Orio. 1 Placa Sant Josep Orio; (34-93) 301-5900, fax
(34-93) 318-3664.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Husa Palace, opened by Cesar Ritz in 1919, embodies
Old World elegance with its marble columns, stately restaurants and
well-appointed rooms. Near the fashionable Passeig de Gracia, the
161-room Palace, 668 Gran Via, (34-93) 318-4837, fax (34-93)
318-0148, charges $235 for a double room. The thick carpets,
antiques and landscapes on the walls bespeak opulence.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    For a spectacular view of the Mediterranean and equally
impressive seafood, Cal Pinxo is the place to go. Situated in
Barceloneta, an up-and-coming neighborhood originally built for
fishermen's families, this restaurant, at 124 Baluard, (34-93)
221-5028, has excellent paella, sea bass (lubina) and esquexada, a
seafood salad full of olive oil and cod. Try a bottle of Yllera, a
smooth red wine from Old Castile. Dinner for two costs about $65,
with wine.
 &HT;    A popular place for business executives and artists is Senyor
Parellada, a bright yellow room filled with plants. The restaurant,
at 37 Argenteria, (34-93) 310-5094, has excellent hake with
donostiara sauce, containing olive oil, butter and lemon, and
angler fish with burnt garlic. Dinner for two: $65, with wine.
 &HT;    Widely considered one of the best tapas bars in a city famous
for tapas, Cal Pep, 8 Placa de les Olles, (34-93) 310-7961, has
seafood galore. At night, there are often lines for the bustling
marble bar, but it is worth the wait. Try the succulent baby squid
(chiperones), the grilled shrimp, the mussels and the spinach with
garbonzo beans and garlic. Dinner for two: $60, with wine.
 &HT;    Budget-minded tourists might try Agut, 16 Gignas, (34-93)
315-1709, with an $8.50 lunch menu with entree, wine and dessert
included. At night, menus are a la carte. The vegetable pie with
tomato sauce was tasty, as were the filet of hake with Provencal
sauce and the lasagna with escalivada, a mixture of grilled
peppers, eggplant and onions. Dinner for two: $40, with wine.
 &HT;    The $6.50 lunch menu is a stunning bargain at El Convent, in a
converted medieval convent, at 3 Jerusalem, (34-93) 317-1052, just
behind the colorful Boqueria food market. One recent lunch time,
appetizers included lentil salad, baby squid salad and asparagus
with garlic mousse.

 STRONG DOLLAR DEALS  
 &HT;    A strong U.S. dollar is paying off for American travelers,
whether they're heading to Europe or Asia.
 &HT;    Tauck Tours credits the stronger dollar combined with reduced
European prices for lower rates on more than half their European
``Yellow Roads'' itineraries in 1998.
 &HT;    These trips take their name from the colored roads on European
maps which denote the less-traveled and more scenic back roads.
 &HT;    Tauck says its greatest savings are in the 14-day Romantic
Germany program, reduced by 11 percent over last year; the 12-day
Alps of Switzerland, Austria and Italy, reduced by more than 10
percent; and a 14-day Holland to Switzerland program nearly 10
percent less.
 &HT;    For example, the Germany trip is priced at $3,590 for 1998
compared to $3,990 in 1997. Prices do not include airfare. Contact
your travel agent.
 &HT;    In 1998, trips to Asia offered by Overseas Adventure Travel
(OAT) also reflect savings, in some cases as much as $800 for a
couple.
 &HT;    A 15-day Discover Thailand program which cost $3,190 last year
is priced at $2,790 this year with Nov. 18 and Dec. 5 departures
slated.
 &HT;    A Nov. 4 departure is priced at $2,590 this year compared to
$2,990 last year.
 &HT;    OAT trips, which are designed for older travelers, include
round-trip international air.
 &HT;    For a catalog, call (800) 873-5628.
 &HT;    
 SAFARI SINGLES SAVINGS  
 &HT;    The single supplement will be waived on a special Kenya Safari
offered by African Travel Inc.
 &HT;    The land price of the tour is $2,395 for a December departure,
saving $650 on the single supplement. Air is $1,795 per person from
New York.
 &HT;    The Kenya Explorer includes visits to the Jane Goodall
Chimpanzee Sanctuary, Karen Blixen Museum and a nature walk in the
Aberdares. Reservations should be made through your travel agent.

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's a love affair that may have started in a Paris bistro or a
cafe in Tuscany _ the love affair, that is, between an American
traveler and European wines.
 &HT;    More than one oenophile (wine lover) has been born after a
memorable trip abroad. For those enamored of the grape, there are
wine tours that show off the best of Europe's vineyards and
wineries. Here's a taste. Rates are per-person, based on double
occupancy.
 &HT;     Esperienze Italiane Travel  (c/o Felidia Ristorante, 243 East
58th St., New York, N.Y. 10022; 212-758-1488; www.lidiasitaly.com)
was founded by chef and restauranteur Lidia Bastianich, who offers
visits to leading Italian restaurants and sessions with food and
wine experts in Tuscany and Umbria.
 &HT;    These are food and art trips as much as wine trips. For example,
in Tuscany, the food writer Burton Anderson and Baron Francesco
Ricasoli of the Castello Brolio estate are guests of honor.
 &HT;    There's a cooking demonstration in Chianti, olive-oil tastings
and wine tasting with producers from Isola e Olena and Fontodi
wines. The San Lorenzo market in Florence and Michelangelo's New
Sacristy are also on the itinerary.
 &HT;    The cost of the six-night trip is $3,950 and includes
accommodation and most meals.
 &HT;     France In Your Glass  (814 35th Ave., Seattle, Wash. 98122;
800-578-0903; www.inyourglass.com) is the leading American company
for wine tours and vacations to the greatest wine-growing regions
of France. That's no easy task.
 &HT;    Unlike Napa and Sonoma Valleys in California, with their
open-door policies and tasting rooms that welcome one and all, the
great wine chateaux in France are virtually inaccessible without a
formal initiation.
 &HT;    France in Your Glass' founder and president Ronald Holden has
made his reputation by getting American wine-lovers past otherwise
locked gates. He offers the kind of access that only those in the
trade customarily have.
 &HT;    The ``Connoisseur Wine Programs'' allow guests to taste the most
prestigious wines of France in areas such as Bordeaux, Burgundy and
Champagne.
 &HT;    For example, ``Great Estates of Burgundy'' is a four-night
program that offers tours of the great Burgundian vineyards and
private visits and tasting with such ``negociants'' or shippers as
Bouchard and Leflaive and growers like Roumier, Matrot and Senard.
 &HT;    In addition, meals are at Michelin-starred restaurants and grand
cru wines are served.
 &HT;    Lodging for five nights in Beaune, daily breakfast and some
lunches and dinners are included in the $3,295 price.
 &HT;    Holden also offers weekends with wine expert Michael Broadbent,
a ``Grand Tour'' led by himself and Broadbent, culinary and food
vacations, and ```Your Way' Independent Wine Country Programs.''
 &HT;    These trips, in such regions as Alsace, Bordeaux, Burgundy,
Champagne and Provence, are for travelers who want to go along at
their own pace.
 &HT;    The price varies, but expect to pay at least $400 per person in
Burgundy or Bordeaux for up to three people for a one-day program
that includes lunch and visits with a local bilingual wine
professional.
 &HT;     The Parker Company  (319 Lynnway, Lynn, Mass. 01901;
800-280-2811; www.theparkercompany.com) calls its wine and
gastronomy tours to Italy the ``Great Wines of Italy.''
 &HT;    These are affordable three-day, three-night trips that explore
six regions of the country: Latium, Umbria, Tuscany,
Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont and Veneto.
 &HT;    Each tour costs $599 and includes three nights of lodging in
distinctive three- or four-star hotels, sommelier-guided tours,
daily buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner, admission to all wineries
and museums and motorcoach transportation.
 &HT;    Take Tuscany as an example. Guests rendezvous in the town of
Pienza at the Hotel Il Chiostro, a former 15th-century convent. The
first day, they travel to Montepulciano, visit the Redi cellars,
picnic in the Brunello vineyards, and sample the wines at the
Enoteca Regionale.
 &HT;    On day two, it's a similarly packed itinerary in Chianti, and on
day three, in Siena.
 &HT;    In between are picnics, gourmet dinners and a chance to taste
the greatest wines of the region. And the short duration of these
tours make them a good fit into any Italian vacation. It's possible
to combine consecutive three day trips as well.
 &HT;    A nine-day wine tour, for example, runs $1,595.
 &HT;    Finally, wine historians and lovers of the grape note the ``Fete
de Vignerons'' or the Wine Grower's Festival, a unique Swiss
celebration that is held but five times a century in the Lake
Geneva waterside town of Vevey.
 &HT;    More than 250,000 people are expected to attend the last ``Fete
de Vignorons'' of this century, which will be held next year, from
July 26 to Aug. 15, 1999.
 &HT;    Now, of course, is the time to book tickets and a hotel room for
what will likely be a sold-out event.
 &HT;    The festival dates back to 1819, when a banquet and village
parade were the rewards for an outstanding harvest.
 &HT;    Organized by the ``Confrerie des Vignorons,'' the fraternity of
wine growers, the festivities and parade have become increasingly
elaborate over the years.
 &HT;    In 1999, over 4,600 actors and artists will participate in the
spectacle, utilizing a new 18,000-seat arena overlooking Lake
Geneva and the French Alps.
 &HT;    For information on tickets and accommodation, contact
Switzerland Tourism, 608 Fifth Ave., New York, N.Y. 10020;

 &HT;    Takin' a swing at ballroom dancing
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Arthur Murray were here today, he'd probably use the Gap
khaki commercial as a teaching tool.
</P>
<P>
   (Who needs a footprint diagram when you have wiggling models
doing the Lindy hop to Louis Prima?)
</P>
<P>
   As Murray studios celebrate 85 years of eliminating two left
feet, ballroom dancing is becoming hip again - thanks largely to TV
and film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say my business has gone up 25 percent just from the Gap
commercial and others like it that show the swing,'' says Angelo
Caruso, owner of Caruso Dance Sport in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   (Dance 101: The swing is also called the Lindy hop, jive, shag,
jitterbug and boogie-woogie.)
</P>
<P>
   ``People come in here wanting to do the `Gap dance,' `` he says.
``Especially young couples.''
</P>
<P>
   Like rising college sophomore Annie Evans, 18, of North Palm
Beach and her boyfriend, Travis Grainger, 24, who plan to take
lessons this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want something new and different to do,'' she says.
``Besides, swing dancing is the newest thing at clubs, and we have
no idea how to dance together.''
</P>
<P>
   Dewey Whitley, marketing vice president at Arthur Murray
International - based in Coral Gables - is amused by the
``newness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has all been around for so long,'' he says. ``And now
it's a retro craze. Many people moved away from ballrooms after
World War II, so it's really more accurate to call this `social
dancing' or `touch dancing' - where partners are in contact and the
man leads.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman and Arnold Schwarzenegger in
True Lies, who both whipped the tango right back into pop culture,
red rose included.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of movies, The Last Days of Disco, which opened last
week, is one of several recent '70s flicks resurrecting the hustle.
Simply Ballroom and Shall We Dance? are also boosting dance-school
business. And Vanessa Williams' Dance with Me, which debuts July
31, will add fuel to the fire.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same effect Rocky films had on boxing gyms.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden there has just been this major rush,'' says
Gayle Morley, who owns Dancin' Dance Centre in Palm Beach Gardens
with her husband, Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of requests for swing and disco lessons, and
the people who've been coming in are right around 20 to 30 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people are searching for something else to do besides
the same old bar scene,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they're tired of standing across from each other, bouncing
up and down and calling it dancing,'' Joseph adds.
</P>
<P>
   (The U.S. Amateur Ballroom Dancers Association, by the way, has
more than doubled to 15,000 members since 1993, mostly because of
the 30-and-under set.)
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the ballroom-dance revival is that Baby
Boomers are getting older. And with age comes ... decorum.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get into your late 30s and up, you don't want to get
out there and do the jerk on the dance floor when you're executive
vice president of a company,'' Whitley says. ``And you can't
exactly do Michael Jackson moves at a charity gala.''
</P>
<P>
   (Or a ball chairman might tell you to beat it. Ahem.)
</P>
<P>
   Long before Gap ads and dance flicks, however, there was Arthur
Murray - an immigrant baker's son who became the world's best-known
teacher of ballroom dancing. He died in 1991 at age 95.
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, Arthur Murray Teichman - who shortened his
name in 1914 at the suggestion of his dance partner - taught his
first lesson 85 years ago. Now there are about 200 franchised
studios, including one in Fort Lauderdale and another in Sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, the ``Murray method'' involved diagrams with
numbered footsteps; handsome instructors who were told to keep
smiling; studios that Murray kept clean and decorous; and
fashionable dance steps, some of which he helped popularize by
paying young folks to do them in nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   His clients included Eleanor Roosevelt, the Duke and Duchess of
Windsor, John D. Rockefeller Jr., Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney,
Barbara Hutton and Elizabeth Arden. And that's just the short list.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '20s, Arthur Murray branched out into mail order, which
was very unusual at the time,'' says Tony Cardinali, franchise vice
president for Arthur Murray International. ``You could order the
diagrams, which were printed on large sheets like butcher paper,
and spread them out on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Think Twister board. The diagrams - which can be tough to
decipher - are no longer used (except for decoration).
</P>
<P>
   It's just as confusing to try to learn from a book, although
there are plenty of ballroom-dance manuals that give instructions
like ``hand hold push'' and ``Step R foot complete cuddle.''
</P>
<P>
   Huh? Take a class.
</P>
<P>
   When Murray started out, a dance lesson cost $5. Nowadays, a
session averages about $40 for 45 minutes to an hour but can run
less if purchased in a package. Prices also vary depending on
whether it's individual or couple instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy is to take a group lesson like the ones taught
at area dance halls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs $7 a person to get in on ballroom nights - Thursdays
and Saturdays from 8 to 11 p.m. - and we have a class beforehand to
review steps and introduce new ones,'' says Rob McGregor, an owner
of Dazzle Me Twice, a ballroom in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to think of ballroom dancing as this dusty old
thing, but it's had quite a face lift, and we're seeing it here. It
certainly seems to have a more gymnastic, athletic quality about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. In September, the International Olympic Committee gave
full recognition to the International Dancesport Federation, a
vital step in making competitive ballroom dancing - or dancesport,
as some folks call it - an Olympic event. And cable TV channels are
increasing coverage, so it's not just on PBS anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Dancesport will be an exhibition gig in the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney, then officials will decide in 2001 if it'll be a medal
event in future Games.
</P>
<P>
   Fear not, however, if you're no world-class athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely rare to teach someone who just doesn't get
it,'' Whitley says. ``In 20 years of being in this business, I've
never had a total failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's the best thing about ballroom dancing. If you know
how to walk, you've mastered the hard part.''
</P>

SWING 1930s and 1998
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the ``khakis swing' Gap ad campaign and the resurging
popularity of lounges (what's a disco?), the swing - popular in the
'30s - is reborn. The Depression, which made record sales drop from
100 million in 1927 to 6 million in 1931, had the music industry
scrambling for a new sound. Enter ``King of Swing'' Benny Goodman,
who gave jazz rhythms an uplifted tempo that was perfect for
dancing. First known as the Lindy hop after Charles Lindberg's
``hop'' across the Atlantic to Paris, the swing has variations
called the jitterbug, shag, jive and boogie-woogie. Because the
dance involved acrobatic movements, it was barred from many dance
halls as being too dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   (GT) THE TANGO 1912
</P>
<P>
   The tango is a mixture of the tangano a dance that African
slaves take to Haiti and Cuba in the 18th century and the habanera
(''Havana dance'') of 19th-century Cuba. The combo arrives in
Argentina via migrants and becomes a hit among cowboys and in the
Buenos Aires slums. While rich folks think it too unrefined, the
dance nevertheless moves to Europe first Paris, then London in 1912
where it is performed on stage in The Sunshine Girl. That same
year, Murray Teichman who changes his name to Arthur Murray in 1914
teaches his first dance lesson at the Grand Central Plaza in New
York. THE MAMBO 1943
</P>
<P>
   Cuban bandleader Perez Prado is credited with creating the mambo
craze in 1943 by modifying the dances performed by sugar-cane
cutters and introducing them in Havana nightclubs. (The word
``mambo'' supposedly comes from the Nanigo dialect spoken in Cuba.
Another version says it's the borrowed name of an African
priestess.) A blend of Latin American and jazz rhythms, the mambo's
trademark is a beat in each bar on which the dancer takes no step.
By 1953, there are weekly mambo contests at the Savoy Ballroom in
Harlem. THE HUSTLE 1975
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of solo dancing, couples in the '70s return to
partner formations, and the hustle actually requires folks to touch
(forget the bump). The step-tap-step-tap American-born jig has
variations in discos across the country (i.e., the New Yor
</P>
<P>
   (Bet you can still hum the tune.) Four years later, Gloria
Gaynor's I Will Survive is the No. 1 hit, but the hustle doesn't
survive. By the mid-'80s, solo dancing (to tunes like Michael
Jackson's Beat It) is back.

<P>
   MIAMI, Fla. _ Milton Finney is a small man with small needs.
Five feet is a struggle but making ends meet has never been a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be a millionaire,'' said Finney, who is
homeless and eats most meals at Camillus House, a downtown Miami
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of other homeless in the city, Finney might
qualify for a landmark settlement hammered out of a 1988 class
action suit against the city for harassing homeless people. Unlike
many at Camillus House one day this week, Finney, 58, has actually
heard about it, especially the part where he gets $1,250. He is, in
fact, already banking on it for his move to easy street.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could just get a little bit of money and put it in the
bank,'' he whispers conspiratorially, ``I could live off the
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   And there, in a nutshell, is the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The case, considered remarkable by many civil libertarians, is
the first to lay down rules protecting the homeless as a group.
</P>
<P>
   But while it untangles constitutional issues, in practical terms
the settlement poses more complicated problems.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, contrary to Finney's calculations, interest on
$1,250 will definitely not line his pockets and finance his
retirement. Finney would be better served, some suggest, by giving
the money to an agency that could help him off the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about giving a dysfunctional person $1,250 to
continue to be dysfunctional,'' says Brother Paul Johnson, director
of Camillus House for the last two decades. ``It doesn't bring
about large change and my point is people who are homeless don't
have the same ability to operate like you and me. They're too busy
running from the police or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal theorists who wage the war for the homeless realize
this. But as they see it, the homeless should be free to do as they
please. Isn't that what they spent 10 years proving?
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt anybody in the class will take the $1,250 and invest
it wisely and make themselves into substantial economic citizens,''
said Bruce Rogow, a constitutional law expert and American Civil
Liberties Union lawyer arguing another case connected to the
homeless in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as a matter of law they are entitled to some compensation
for their travails and if they misspend it, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Money aside, how in the world do you track down all the homeless
people who might qualify?
</P>
<P>
   Next month, the ACLU hopes to start signing up homeless to
collect the money paid out by the city. The ACLU, which sued the
city in 1988 to stop police from running ``bum details'' and
generally harassing people forced to live on the streets, plans to
run newspaper ads. The ads will appear each week for the first
three weeks in July. They're also hoping homeless groups will get
the word out. They have 90 days to sign people up and, so far, are
keeping their fingers crossed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some people who feel we'll be lucky if we get 20
people to come forward,'' said Benjamin Waxman, an ACLU attorney
who argued the case.
</P>
<P>
   The case has its beginnings on the day before New Year's Eve in
1987, when a cold front crept over Miami and dropped temperatures
to 51 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   As beds and floor space filled up at Camillus House, Brother
Paul _ one of three priests from the Brother of the Good Shepherd
living at the downtown mission _ started handing out blankets to
those locked out of the gated compound and sleeping on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up at 1 a.m. and heard someone on speakers so I went to
the chapel and looked out the door and Miami police had cordoned
off the street and had buses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That night, 40 homeless people were arrested, clearing the way
for the next day's King Orange Jamboree Parade through the heart of
the downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Paul, an attorney for the mission and other homeless
advocates met that day with the chief of police and complained
bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were going to do an internal investigation, but they
never got back to me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year, police raided parks before events, including
Pope John Paul II's visit in the spring of 1987. Twice in early
1990, they rousted groups in parks, gathered up their belongings
and set them on fire. Altogether, the ACLU estimates 3,500 homeless
were arrested in sweeps between 1987 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny ``Charles'' Major was 19, earning $3.35 an hour working
day labor and living in Lummus Park in Miami when police handcuffed
him, burned his belongings and took him to jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying my best in life. My best,'' said Major, who moved
out of his parents house and lived in the park for two months
before finding another relative to live with. ``When you go through
things like that and don't know why you're accosted, that can
contaminate your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   So in late 1988, ACLU lawyers met at Camillus House to plot a
strategy and came up with the lawsuit, Waxman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory of the lawsuit was the city had this secret agenda
to drive homeless people out of the city, so it used an array of
misdemeanor ordinances that homeless people would be in violation
of to target them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw this as just trampling the rights of the most
powerless, impoverished citizens of the city. The city denied it up
one side and down the other. It's one thing to say we made a
mistake or haven't looked at it that way. But to just deny
something so clearly obvious and so severely injurious to the
lowest of the low got people's passions up.''
</P>
<P>
   Three men at the shelter agreed to be plaintiffs in the case and
at the end of December, the agency sued the city.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins refused to issue
an injunction against the city to stop sweeps. But after ACLU
attorneys convinced him to make it a class action and presented
evidence of the 1990 raids, Atkins ordered the city to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later Atkins issued a stunning ruling finding the city
violated rights of the homeless and ordered the city to establish
two ``safe zones'' where homeless could live without fear of
arrest. City officials met with ACLU lawyers, but refused to set up
the safe zones and instead appealed Atkins' decision.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court sent the case back to Atkins and asked him
to reconsider, saying conditions might have changed after four
years.
</P>
<P>
   A second trial in 1995 ended with the same ruling. The city
again appealed. But this time the appellate court ordered the ACLU
and the city to settle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It struck us as being unusual,'' Waxman said. ``I don't think
there was anyone who thought it could be resolved through that
process, not only because of the breadth and magnitude of the
issues, but because of the real kind of hostility that there was.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, the two sides finally submitted their settlement to
Atkins, a 32-page deal that includes sensitivity training for
police, new definitions for when a homeless person can be arrested,
the kind of documentation needed to claim part of the settlement
and what kind of money should be awarded.
</P>
<P>
   The money came down to $600,000 for the estimated 3,500 eligible
homeless and $900,000 for attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   The money would be divided up into $1,500 vouchers _ or a debit
card worth $1,500 that could be used in area stores _ to those
still homeless and $1,250 cash to those now living in homes.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins, however, suggested a few tougher standards when he
reviewed the settlement before approving a notice to the class.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he didn't think attorneys should be paid more
than the homeless and suggested reducing attorney's fees to
$749,000 and increasing the cap on awards to $751,000.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins also thought requiring homeless to document their arrest
or loss of belongings was a bit absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if they will have receipts proving that they
bought their cardboard boxes, etc.; or a government report of the
destruction of their belongings unless they were arrested,'' he
wrote in May.
</P>
<P>
   Sworn affidavits, he suggested, would suffice.
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed out that the agreement failed to provide for one
of the most basic needs of the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court suggests that public restrooms be designated as
accessible to homeless persons in the downtown areas at all times
of day or night. One way to do this would be to install, at least
temporarily, banks of `port-a-johns' with sinks and/or showers at
locations downtown where homeless people congregate,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The order was just another reason why homeless advocates have
cheered Atkins throughout the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The homeless are really fortunate Clyde Atkins was assigned
this case because he's been a maverick,'' Brother Paul said. ``He's
going to go down in history as a real champion of the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Atkins suggestions are just that. Suggestions. And so far
the city has done nothing to implement them, Waxman said. Since two
previous safe zones _one under the overpass to Miami Beach and
another at Bicentennial Park _ have been closed, no others have
been established.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Bittner, an assistant city attorney, declined to comment
on the details of the case and said the two sides still need to
discuss Atkins' suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins will hold a hearing on the settlement Sept. 29. In the
meantime, the Miami-Dade County Providers Forum, a collection of
groups that help the homeless, will meet next week to figure out
how to begin carrying out the settlement, said Morris Drew, interim
director of the Rainbow Beginning Ministries, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be monumental,'' said Drew, who wandered through
downtown one day this week in search of homeless to tell about the
deal. ``It's not just finding those now. That won't be so hard.
It's the old ones. We had a list of 30, but that was two years ago.
Since then, they've all scattered this way and that. There's some
skepticism that we'll get enough people to meet the $600,000. But
we're going to push for the max.''

 &HT;    Hummingbirds give lessons in flight at UT
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ University of Texas zoologist Peng Chai really
started something in 1996 when he captured eight ruby-throated
hummingbirds in his West Austin back yard to study their flight
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, senior UT aerospace engineering students were
also studying the popular birds, using high-speed video cameras and
computers to analyze their wing movements in hopes of learning how
to build a robot hummingbird for military reconnaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite equipment failures and other setbacks, the students in
aerospace engineer Ron Stearman's design classes had soon found
something new.
</P>
<P>
   Research in the 1930s had shown that, at their normal rate of 55
beats a second, the birds' wings twist like a propeller blade,
tracing horizontal figure-eights in the air to hold their bodies in
a hover. The UT students found that the wingtips apparently can
also trace the shape of an airfoil, the curved profile of an
airplane's wing.
</P>
<P>
   A robot hummingbird would be a candidate for what the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency calls micro air vehicles:
miniature reconnaissance aircraft that soldiers could carry in
their packs to safely find out what's over the next hill and select
targets for artillery or airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Tentative specifications call for a 6-inch micro aircraft
weighing less than 2 ounces and capable of carrying a
camera-on-a-microchip for 60-minute surveillance flights at a range
of six miles.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have
developed a conventional jet engine that is less than one-half inch
long. It is one of several candidates to be the propulsion system .
</P>
<P>
   The 3-inch-long ruby throats, one of more than 300 species of
hummingbirds that are found only in the Western Hemisphere, are an
appealing model for a micro airplane because they can take off and
land quickly, flit from side to side while hovering and even fly
upside down.
</P>
<P>
   All that motion comes at a high price in energy. Previous
research has found that a 170-pound person would have to consume
130 pounds of bread to match a hummingbird's energy output.
</P>
<P>
   Chai has found his captive ruby throats amazingly easy to train
to fly in a wind tunnel and to hover at a sugar-water feeder in a
clear plastic study box. He has measured their average maximum
flight speed at 35 mph and found that, during migration, when they
put on extra weight for the trip, the females are better at
hovering than the males.
</P>
<P>
   The birds have not taken as well to the engineering studies.
Stearman's classes have found it easier, for instance, to
photograph hovering males than females.
</P>
<P>
   ``During filming, the hummingbird Felice would not cooperate,''
the spring study group, led by senior Erol Cagatay , wrote in its
final report. ``Felice did not react to the filming environment as
well as last semester's hummingbird, Bob, did (until) live, red
flowers (were put) at the end of the feeder to simulate a real
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The students found that Felice was hard to film because she
didn't fly perpendicular to the horizon but rolled to one side and
skewed to the left or right, which they assumed was related to the
location of the feeder.
</P>
<P>
   Chai, however, theorized that Felice merely was attuned to the
students in the lab and was flying that way to keep an eye on what
they were doing.
</P>
<P>
   Stearman's spring semester students also arranged with the UT
geology department for a , CAT scan of a dead hummingbird's
skeleton to learn more about how a living hummingbird's wings work.
</P>
<P>
   A bird's wings are comparable to a person's arms, folding and
bending at the elbow and wrist with each wing beat. But older
research has shown that hummingbird wings do not move at the elbow
and wrist. Instead, their shoulders are jointed in such a way that
the wings are free to move in all directions.
</P>
<P>
   Hummingbird bones are fragile, however, and the CAT scan was
successful only in imaging the bird's head and beak.

 &HT;    Commentary: The company of women
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ There is something about the company of women.
</P>
<P>
   It can be exhilarating or frustrating, hilarious or solemn,
silly or serious. Or all of those things simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   I have not always had the company of women. As a young girl, I
had a ``best friend.'' We were blood sisters in the truest Tom
Sawyer sense of the term. We sat side by side on creekbanks, caught
frogs together, went skinny-dipping in the pond and pointed out to
each other rainbowed moons on hazy nights.
</P>
<P>
   We fantasized about what it would be like to kiss a boy. We
whispered about secret loves over our geography books and read
parts of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books aloud to one another. We
experimented with lipstick and mascara and shared the trauma of our
first pairs of pantyhose and pumps.
</P>
<P>
   The truly fortunate retain that first ``best'' friendship all
their lives. But I didn't. Nor do I remember why we drifted apart.
I suppose it doesn't matter at this late date. I still have these
memories. And other ``best friends'' came along _ each one moving
on before I was ready, but heeding some cosmic call neither one of
us understood.
</P>
<P>
   As a woman, my best friends became mentors. Wise women, usually
older than me, who lovingly and patiently guided me. They helped me
with my parenting and career, with my spiritual journey and
personal frustration. Their very presence, older and calmer,
modeled hope and possibility for me at a time in my life when both
were in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   There was one bleak period when I looked around and suddenly
realized I had no circle of friends. The most recent ones had
either moved away or emotionally distanced themselves. I had one or
two good friends, but time and responsibilities kept us from
investing what was needed for that most special of bonds, and
aching for the company of women.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly I had many acquaintances, either from church or PTA or
work. But no one to ask over to watch ``Out of Africa'' with. No
one with whom to run to Dairy Queen at 9 p.m. for a Buster Bar. You
know ... friends.
</P>
<P>
   I came to realize those times of aloneness are a natural part of
the seasons of one's life. They happen, and during them we must
learn to be patient and mindful. What am I learning about myself
during this time of solitude that will make me a better friend when
the next one comes along? Because they always do. Usually when we
least expect them.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to bring me into the circle of women
friends I now have and treasure. A phone call, actually, from a
woman I know who said she and another friend were forming a small
group to meet regularly to share our spiritual journeys. Would I
like to join them?
</P>
<P>
   Now, such groups can be stimulating or a total waste of time.
Much work must be done on group dynamics, bonding and building
community along the way. It doesn't just happen. It's a process,
and every step is fraught with both discovery and danger. Walking
the path, however, can be well worth it.
</P>
<P>
   So more than a year ago, we began to meet. We talk about what
God is doing in our lives, or not doing. We share good books, both
enlightening and lusty. We share recipes and baby pictures. We
laugh together and cry together. Sometimes we just sit and listen
to ``Ode to Joy'' played on a dulcimer. Other times, we sit in the
scented glow of a candle and pray.
</P>
<P>
   We bring together many gifts and talents. We are an amazing
circle of women _ strong, yet fragile; whole, yet hurting;
confident, yet shaky. All these things we pour out and into one
another until we each are built up by this, our very own ``cloud of
witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   I like to imagine us 40 years from now, still meeting, probably
widowed. Still laughing and crying, still sharing books _ both
enlightening and lusty, still encouraging one another along the
journey.
</P>
<P>
   I see our gray heads bowed in a circle, our wrinkled,
age-spotted hands clasped as the warmth and strength of one flows
into the other and the other and the other ... in this company of
women.

 &HT;    Commentary: Mouseketeers in the hands of an angry God
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not easy living just down the interstate from Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   There's the traffic congestion. There are those out-of-state
guests who always want you to take them there. And then there are
the hurricanes and giant meteoroids of death crashing in from outer
space.
</P>
<P>
   Televangelist and former Republican presidential candidate Pat
Robertson recently warned about those last two problems. Robertson
said that by allowing gay groups to come to Disney World, Disney
and the city of Orlando are risking divine retribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would warn Orlando that you're right in the way of some
serious hurricanes, and I don't think I'd be waving those flags in
God's face if I were you,'' Robertson said on ``The 700 Club''
television show. The flags he mentioned were rainbow-motif banners
brought out for the Gay Days gathering in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson warned that toleration of homosexuality ``will bring
about terrorist bombs. It will bring earthquakes, tornadoes and
possibly a meteor.''
</P>
<P>
   We've been warned.
</P>
<P>
   The Greater Disney World area is, geologically speaking, fairly
safe from earthquakes. Hurricanes, though, remain a problem but
more for coastal areas than for Orlando and Disney. Great. God gets
angry at Disney and smites Daytona Beach or Merritt Island. Is this
fair?
</P>
<P>
   And why would God punish Disney World for hosting gay people and
leave Key West alone? Central Florida coastal homeowners want this
theology expounded in greater detail so they can send rebuttals to
their insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a coastal dweller and a person whose livelihood depends on
the brisk sale of newspapers, my vote is with the meteor.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction of Disney World by a giant, burning rock hurled
from the far reaches of the Solar System is not without a certain
mean-spirited appeal -- particularly after Disney hiked ticket
prices the way it's been doing.
</P>
<P>
   This lamentable celestial event would be a great story during a
slow news cycle and would give us a chance to build Interstate 4
over again. This time doing it right.
</P>
<P>
   Another plus is that meteorites are valuable.
</P>
<P>
   In Monahans, Texas, a meteorite that recently fell near a public
basketball court was supposed to be worth several thousand dollars.
This set off a controversy between the city and the kids who found
it. The city commission decided the kids would get the rock.
</P>
<P>
   So there you go. If the Disney neighborhood were hit by a
good-sized meteorite, you get both divine retribution and
compensation for property owners.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a big improvement over the cruder destruction done
by hurricanes, but maybe I'm just biased.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, however, does not share this view. He has a certain
fondness for hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   He says that not only once but twice he made hurricanes change
course to avoid Virginia Beach and his broadcasting equipment. The
last time, in 1986, the hurricane spared the broadcasting antennae
but instead killed 16 people where it finally did touch down.
Divine deliverance doesn't have the same effect for everyone
involved.
</P>
<P>
   This time though, Robertson is changing his shtick by bringing a
hurricane to an area.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of people, Robertson likes his divine displeasure
sudden, dramatic and big. Hurricanes, bombs and rocks hurtling from
outer space. This seems to presume that God wants the maximum
publicity for His efforts.
</P>
<P>
   I believe the Lord hurts those who hurt themselves. This tends
not to be flashy as your usual clouds of locusts, hurricanes and
exploding buildings. Sin punishment is a slow and grinding business
and it never seems to stop.
</P>
<P>
   We get punished for greed by seeing forests turn into strip
malls. We get punished for intolerance by people killing each
other. We get punished for neglecting kids by seeing them turn into
nasty adults.
</P>
<P>
   And we are already being punished for Disney World by having
traffic back up on Interstate 4 for the width of the state.
</P>
<P>
   A quick hurricane can be child's play by comparison.

 &HT;    Short Takes: Death and taxes _ and confidentiality
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Independent prosecutor Ken Starr's theory that no trust survives
a dead client and his lawyer as long as the inquisitor's heart is
pure would have thrilled Inspector Javert. The extremity of Starr's
argument may be his way of negotiating the Supreme Court into a
milder, but still beneficial, decision that opens the gate to the
unfortunate Vince Foster's terminal agony. Read that as Hillary
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in scenarios is only in degree of mischief. How
does this sound? You're buying an antique foot-warmer from your
aunt. You happen to mention to your lawyer you think your uncle is
a mountebank and poltroon. Your lawyer makes a note, ``uncle fred .
. . mountebank, poltroon.'' You die. Uncle Fred thinks he's got a
case against your estate. He sues, gets the notes.
</P>
<P>
   Or, rumor persists that O.J. Simpson, now dead, told Johnny
Cochran, his lawyer, what really happened. Prosecutor Marcia Clark
subpoenas Cochran's notes. Or, by then the principle is so degraded
Cochran wants to release his notes and write a book. All in the
interest of justice, both claim.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's team put it straight to the Supreme Court. This means
everyone. Confidentiality dies with you. That inspiration turns the
legal profession into a gaggle of potential snitches. The Supreme
Court shouldn't fall for it _ or a blander alternative. Zealotry in
pin-stripes and a smile is still zealotry.

 &HT;    Early learning pushed young graduate to academic heights
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly after turning 9 years old, Julius Su declared his
intentions to the world.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would attend prestigious Cal Tech, a university that
claims 24 Nobel Prize winners. He said he would pursue a career in
science _ chemistry, perhaps. And he assured all around him he was
dead serious.
</P>
<P>
   Since Julius Su was solving college-level calculus problems at 8
years old, everybody naturally believed whatever he said at 9.
</P>
<P>
   Friday he graduated from Cal Tech, as promised and with honors,
having just turned 19, and with a commitment from Harvard to do
graduate work there as soon as he is available.
</P>
<P>
   He says he is intrigued by something called ``femto chemistry,''
an exquisitely technical pursuit that seeks to understand molecules
at their birth. For the sake of the layman, this is like trying to
figure what's up with the egg at the precise, absolute,
meticulously calculated instant it hits the frying pan _ at the
femtosecond, roughly a million-billionth of a heartbeat, or
thereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pretty amazing field,'' says Su, a pretty amazing teen who
is the first-born in a pretty amazing family.
</P>
<P>
   Julius is the son of Dr. Joe Su, an ocean engineering professor
at Florida Atlantic University, and Dr. Angie Su, a special
programs administrator with the Palm Beach County School Board who
is best known for her innovations in math teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Julius is 18-year-old Jonathan, who is finishing his
sophomore year at Stanford University where he is a pre-med major.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes Judith, 16, who just graduated from Pine Crest High
School in Fort Lauderdale and soon will be off to study engineering
at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   The baby of the Boca Raton family is 7-year-old Jessica, whose
intellectual skills are already apparent: She was counting at 12
months, reading at 17 months and today uses her personal computer
to go on line and solve algebra problems at university Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was reading before I was even aware of it,'' Dr. Angie
said. ``I took her to sign up for pre-school. We walked into the
office, and she saw some bottles of cleaning liquids on the shelf.
She started reading off the names _ Windex . . . Mr. Clean . . .
Lysol . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``The teacher there couldn't believe it and took her into a room
and gave her a book. She started reading that, too. She was not 18
months old. I don't know for sure how long she had been able to
read like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to conclude that the Su family's remarkable
academic achievements are the results of two expert educators
working with a fine gene pool. That is correct.
</P>
<P>
   But wait just a femtosecond here.
</P>
<P>
   Angie Su wants parents to understand that they are all capable
of making all their children smarter. Environment, she maintains,
is still a powerful factor in development, and it isn't being
exploited nearly enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in constant stimulation for the child,'' she said.
``Teach children as early as possible _ the day they come home from
the hospital. There should be no down time. They should not be left
alone by themselves, but the environment should be structured
either to be self-stimulating or stimulated by the care-giver.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, this means babies need constant action and
inter-action. They need to have their five senses touched, the more
the better. They need to do and not watch.
</P>
<P>
   The Sus raised their kids by continually bombarding them with
incentives to use their brains: Oversized books were left propped
open in the crib; classical music was played during naps and at
bedtime; reading aloud became epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   And mathematics was introduced on Day One. Dr. Angie invented
the nationally heralded Math Is Not Difficult (MIND) program for
use in the schools, and numbers were invaluable to accelerating the
development of her children in the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you develop math abilities, somehow the brain structure
changes, and other learning becomes easier,'' she said. ``Studies
have shown the brain gets wired differently when children become
mathematically literate at an early age. Math opens other doors and
is a big reason why our children have performed so well
academically.''
</P>
<P>
   Su pasted multiplication tables throughout her house. Her
children grew up playing math games instead of board games. When
Julius turned 9, he had progressed enough to edit his mother's
doctoral thesis on math education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes he was frightening,'' she said. ``We just couldn't
believe a boy could learn that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. and Dr. Su came to Florida 13 years ago, having met and
married in their Queens, N.Y., Taiwanese-American community. Though
she has been a much heralded innovator in the public schools, all
of her children have gone to private schools, except for brief
terms in summer gifted programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree with my husband on this,'' she says. ``He believes
private schools do a better job of catering to your needs. He won.
But I believe in the public schools. I have a lot of friends who
went through the public schools and did just as well. I'm a product
of the public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The Su family set aside research projects long enough to gather
in Pasadena, Calif., this weekend to celebrate Julius' graduation.
Angie and Joe reflected upon the many wonderful surprises their
bright children have given them.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, that tuition bill that came from Cal Tech several
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It said, `amount owed: zero.' We thought it was a mistake,''
Angie Su said. ``We called Julius. It turned out he had won a full
scholarship. He's so modest he didn't tell us.''
</P>
<P>
   To this math-loving family, it was a zero that was counted as a
great return on lifelong investments.

 &HT;    Christian Coalition gives governor many nods, few hallelujahs
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In a political year when the GOP treats him
as a political deity, about the only Republicans who don't profess
undying belief in Gov. George W. Bush are members of the Christian
Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   They say _ always with a smile, always with respect _ Bush is
not everything they want him to be. For some, he is a hair off on
the issues. For others, he is not loud enough.
</P>
<P>
   They are backing him for re-election, but some are not ready to
sign on for a possible Bush presidential race. With Democrat Garry
Mauro as the only other major choice in November, Bush runs no risk
of losing Christian Coalition support at the ballot box this year.
</P>
<P>
   But that could change in 2000 if he enters the presidential
derby that could feature several candidates _ including Pat
Buchanan, Dan Quayle, John Ashcroft, Gary Bauer and Steve Forbes _
whose paths to the White House run through the farther-to-the-right
wing of the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that with time he will become more forceful,'' Texas
Christian Coalition member Kathryn Green of Pampa said of Bush .
</P>
<P>
   Sam Gaines of San Antonio, Texas, is another Christian Coalition
supporter who finds himself concerned about the ``degree'' of
Bush's commitment to the ideals the organization pushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be articulating it, but I'm not hearing it,'' Gaines
said. ``I don't think it's an issue of a conscious decision. It is
probably more trying to keep a coalition built or together.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bush moves toward the November election he hopes will be a
Democratic disaster of biblical proportion, the coalition is the
goal. Doing the things that would make folks like Gaines and Green
happy could make other voters unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democrats, who will hold their convention later this month
in San Antonio, are ever eager to make the case that the state GOP
is held captive by the religious right. Last month, when Bush took
a hard line against Indian casinos, Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Mauro said Bush _ with an eye on a presidential race _
was pandering to the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the lack of unquestioning loyalty from Christian
Coalition backers is a conundrum for a governor who works religious
faith into all of his major speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll be getting a governor who believes in the power of
faith to transform lives, and who believes government should
welcome and encourage the help of churches and synagogues and
people of faith to bring hope and help to those who need it,'' he
said in his convention speech.
</P>
<P>
   But if he wants to move toward the White House after November,
Bush might have to court the Christian Coalition more vigorously.
In Iowa, home of the nation's first presidential caucus, the
religious right represents about 45 percent of the caucus vote and
is a major force in the state party. Faith and freedom
</P>
<P>
   Bush lit up the joint wherever he showed up at the convention.
Friday morning, Texas Federation of Republican Women members
happily lined up to pay $10 for a photo with the governor. At a
breakfast afterward, he drew an enthusiastic response, topped only
by the thunderous applause that greeted him Friday when he spoke to
the convention.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest convention event that Bush did not attend, and
about the only one where his name went unmentioned from the dais,
was the Texas Christian Coalition's ``Faith and Freedom Banquet''
that drew 1,500 people and raised about $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   The event also served as a reminder that the Christian Coalition
and its supporters _ through nothing more nefarious that
willingness being willing to get involved in the process _ have
worked their way into the party leadership. State GOP Chairwoman
Susan Weddington, a vocal Bush backer , was recognized at the
banquet as a past winner of the group's ``Friend of the Family
Award.'' State GOP Vice Chairman David Barton emceed the banquet.
</P>
<P>
   As they waited in the buffet line, Christian Coalition members
and supporters talked about Bush as a politician with potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things I differ with him on,'' said Barbara
Kelly of Dallas. ``He is not as strong on the abortion issue for
one thing. He never verbalizes it enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush believes abortion should be legal only in cases involving
rape, incest or a threat to the health of the mother. While the
Christian Coalition seeks to ban abortions, Bush pushes a pragmatic
message. ``We must reduce the number of abortions in Texas and
America by encouraging adoption, by promoting abstinence and by
making sure Texas parents are involved in the major decision of a
minor child,'' he told the convention.
</P>
<P>
   He also pitched his education plan based on making sure all kids
can read at grade level and barring promotion for students who fail
the state's standardized test, a concept that, in effect, overrules
a school district's ability to decide who gets promoted.
</P>
<P>
   The governor drew criticism at the Christian Coalition banquet
for his stands on education, a keystone of his re-election
campaign. Though a firm believer in local control, Bush is seen by
some Christian Coalition backers as a big-government guy.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what she does not like about Bush's education stand,
Sadie Liska of Dallas replied, ``Goals 2000'' _ a federal program
that gives grants to states that develop more rigorous academic
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``His dad started it, really pushed it, and we're just not in
agreement with it,'' she said. ``I just think it should be back to
the traditional way of teaching and disciplining. Goals 2000 is a
whole new ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Goals 2000 is blasted in the Texas GOP platform approved
Saturday as an example of ``federal projects of social
restructuring . . . which involve real interference with parental
and local control.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Stevens of Fort Worth, a Christian Coalition backer,
criticized Bush for supporting the ``school-to-work'' education
program that critics see as pigeon-holing students too early by
forcing them to make choices on their futures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a violation of the American dream,'' said Stevens. ``When
you have kids in grade nine having to predetermine what the future
will be after that point and then elect whether to go to college or
not or to train for various skills, that is not beneficial for the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   The state GOP platform criticizes school-to-work as a plan to
train a ``docile workforce.''
</P>
<P>
   The platform also took a shot at Bush, calling on him ``to honor
his 1994 pledge to abolish the regulatory authority of the Texas
Education Agency and to transfer their responsibilities to the
elected State Board of Education.'' Minor disagreements
</P>
<P>
   Texas Christian Coalition Chairman Dick Weinhold, an
enthusiastic backer of Bush, said the qualified support from some
Christian Coalition members is to be expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are minor areas where he and I might disagree,''
Weinhold said. ``But they are insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even think of one off the top of my head. I'd like him
to be more aggressive (on education issues). More local control.
More parent involvement. Those kinds of things. But he is making
good strides.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Tate, national executive director for the Christian
Coalition, said he is impressed with Bush's efforts at putting
``faith-based solutions to many of the social problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said Bush, like many politicians, needs occasional
prodding. ``Even some of those that are with us on many, many
issues need that reinforcement, and I'm sure the governor on down
to some of the members of Congress need that constant,'' he said.
``That's the only way we are going to really change this country.''

 &HT;    Christian Coalition gives governor many nods, few hallelujahs
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In a political year when the GOP treats him
as a political deity, about the only Republicans who don't profess
undying belief in Gov. George W. Bush are members of the Christian
Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   They say _ always with a smile, always with respect _ Bush is
not everything they want him to be. For some, he is a hair off on
the issues. For others, he is not loud enough.
</P>
<P>
   They are backing him for re-election, but some are not ready to
sign on for a possible Bush presidential race. With Democrat Garry
Mauro as the only other major choice in November, Bush runs no risk
of losing Christian Coalition support at the ballot box this year.
</P>
<P>
   But that could change in 2000 if he enters the presidential
derby that could feature several candidates _ including Pat
Buchanan, Dan Quayle, John Ashcroft, Gary Bauer and Steve Forbes _
whose paths to the White House run through the farther-to-the-right
wing of the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that with time he will become more forceful,'' Texas
Christian Coalition member Kathryn Green of Pampa said of Bush .
</P>
<P>
   Sam Gaines of San Antonio, Texas, is another Christian Coalition
supporter who finds himself concerned about the ``degree'' of
Bush's commitment to the ideals the organization pushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be articulating it, but I'm not hearing it,'' Gaines
said. ``I don't think it's an issue of a conscious decision. It is
probably more trying to keep a coalition built or together.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bush moves toward the November election he hopes will be a
Democratic disaster of biblical proportion, the coalition is the
goal. Doing the things that would make folks like Gaines and Green
happy could make other voters unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democrats, who will hold their convention later this month
in San Antonio, are ever eager to make the case that the state GOP
is held captive by the religious right. Last month, when Bush took
a hard line against Indian casinos, Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Mauro said Bush _ with an eye on a presidential race _
was pandering to the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the lack of unquestioning loyalty from Christian
Coalition backers is a conundrum for a governor who works religious
faith into all of his major speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll be getting a governor who believes in the power of
faith to transform lives, and who believes government should
welcome and encourage the help of churches and synagogues and
people of faith to bring hope and help to those who need it,'' he
said in his convention speech.
</P>
<P>
   But if he wants to move toward the White House after November,
Bush might have to court the Christian Coalition more vigorously.
In Iowa, home of the nation's first presidential caucus, the
religious right represents about 45 percent of the caucus vote and
is a major force in the state party. Faith and freedom
</P>
<P>
   Bush lit up the joint wherever he showed up at the convention.
Friday morning, Texas Federation of Republican Women members
happily lined up to pay $10 for a photo with the governor. At a
breakfast afterward, he drew an enthusiastic response, topped only
by the thunderous applause that greeted him Friday when he spoke to
the convention.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest convention event that Bush did not attend, and
about the only one where his name went unmentioned from the dais,
was the Texas Christian Coalition's ``Faith and Freedom Banquet''
that drew 1,500 people and raised about $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   The event also served as a reminder that the Christian Coalition
and its supporters _ through nothing more nefarious that
willingness being willing to get involved in the process _ have
worked their way into the party leadership. State GOP Chairwoman
Susan Weddington, a vocal Bush backer , was recognized at the
banquet as a past winner of the group's ``Friend of the Family
Award.'' State GOP Vice Chairman David Barton emceed the banquet.
</P>
<P>
   As they waited in the buffet line, Christian Coalition members
and supporters talked about Bush as a politician with potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things I differ with him on,'' said Barbara
Kelly of Dallas. ``He is not as strong on the abortion issue for
one thing. He never verbalizes it enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush believes abortion should be legal only in cases involving
rape, incest or a threat to the health of the mother. While the
Christian Coalition seeks to ban abortions, Bush pushes a pragmatic
message. ``We must reduce the number of abortions in Texas and
America by encouraging adoption, by promoting abstinence and by
making sure Texas parents are involved in the major decision of a
minor child,'' he told the convention.
</P>
<P>
   He also pitched his education plan based on making sure all kids
can read at grade level and barring promotion for students who fail
the state's standardized test, a concept that, in effect, overrules
a school district's ability to decide who gets promoted.
</P>
<P>
   The governor drew criticism at the Christian Coalition banquet
for his stands on education, a keystone of his re-election
campaign. Though a firm believer in local control, Bush is seen by
some Christian Coalition backers as a big-government guy.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what she does not like about Bush's education stand,
Sadie Liska of Dallas replied, ``Goals 2000'' _ a federal program
that gives grants to states that develop more rigorous academic
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``His dad started it, really pushed it, and we're just not in
agreement with it,'' she said. ``I just think it should be back to
the traditional way of teaching and disciplining. Goals 2000 is a
whole new ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Goals 2000 is blasted in the Texas GOP platform approved
Saturday as an example of ``federal projects of social
restructuring . . . which involve real interference with parental
and local control.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Stevens of Fort Worth, a Christian Coalition backer,
criticized Bush for supporting the ``school-to-work'' education
program that critics see as pigeon-holing students too early by
forcing them to make choices on their futures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a violation of the American dream,'' said Stevens. ``When
you have kids in grade nine having to predetermine what the future
will be after that point and then elect whether to go to college or
not or to train for various skills, that is not beneficial for the
state.''

 &HT;    Fugitive finally caught after 21 years on run
 &HT;    By Joe Capozzi
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE FOREST PARK, Wash. _ ``Big Bird'' got his nickname because
he was always in the trees.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-7-inch senior citizen often was spotted with his
pruning tools in the upper reaches of the evergeens and cedars
around his home here, a white-brick fourplex 10 miles north of
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see a guy, 6-foot-7, up a step ladder in a tree, you know
what I mean?'' said Bob Henderson, who slapped the moniker on his
next-door neighbor, a 63-year-old retiree who called himself Mark
Bradfield and sometimes went by the nickname Sam.
</P>
<P>
   The retiree and his wife, Linda, had lived in the fourplex about
five years, Henderson said. She worked part-time as a nanny; he was
an excellent handyman who once rebuilt an old dentist's chair he
used as a recliner.
</P>
<P>
   The couple went for walks, out to dinner, barbecued steaks on
the back patio. But the man known as Mark made an impression on
Henderson not so much because of his size, but his generosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would do anything for anyone'' _ from pruning trees to
looking after his landlord's wheelchair-bound son, Henderson said.
Henderson was picked up a year ago and charged with driving while
intoxicated, and ``he bailed me out of jail.''
</P>
<P>
   But recently, Henderson learned something else about Big Bird.
At 5:45 a.m., he noticed five men in blue jeans approaching the
fourplex. Henderson greeted them under the building's arched
entryway.
</P>
<P>
   The men _ part of a multi-agency police task force including the
King County (Wash.) Sheriff's Office, the Seattle Police Department
and the Seattle branch of the FBI _ flashed their badges and asked,
``Where does Mark Bradfield live?''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson nodded down the hall. ``They told me to go back
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he heard loud knocking, followed by muffled voices. He
cracked open his door, and he saw the men rolling Big Bird onto his
stomach in the hallway and handcuffing his thick wrists behind his
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark wasn't saying anything,'' Henderson said. And as the
posse escorted its catch past the ``Spring Is For The Birds'' sign
decorating the fourplex's front doors, Henderson shouted after
them: ``You could have rang the doorbell. You didn't need to wake
everybody up!''
</P>
<P>
   Excuse the authorities for not realizing the early hour. After
21 years and a few near-misses, their search was over: They say
they had finally nabbed the elusive Darion Northrup ``Sam'' Castle.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the man Henderson has seen reading medical
journals and listening to classical music is Sam Castle, a wealthy
Palm Beach County, Fla. fugitive who was convicted in 1972 for
setting a boat on fire. Both he and his girlfriend were badly
burned in the ensuing blaze. She eventually died.
</P>
<P>
   Castle has been on the run since Feb. 2, 1977, authorities say.
That's the day he was supposed to turn himself in to begin serving
a 10-year sentence for arson and conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   But the man now being held without bail in a federal detention
center outside Seattle hasn't identified himself since the
early-morning raid. His next court appearance is scheduled for
Thursday when federal prosecutors will hold a hearing to determine
his identity with photographs, fingerprints or testimony from
people who know him. An extradition hearing will be scheduled
sometime later.
</P>
<P>
   Castle did tell arresting officers last week that he didn't know
he was a wanted man, said Marlin Bachler of the King County
Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I asked him how he could avoid being arrested on this
warrant for 21 years, he said he has been a very law-abiding
citizen,'' Bachler said in court documents.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how long Castle has been living in the Seattle
area. For the past five years here, he kept no regular job, had no
driver license and went by the name Mark Bradfield, the name of the
Palm Beach County prosecutor who handled the original arson case,
said Dick Thurston, spokesman for the FBI's Seattle office.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe Castle was able to elude them for so long
because of his family's wealth. He's a descendant of Samuel
Northrup Castle, one of the earliest settlers in Hawaii and
co-founder in 1851 of Castle &AMP; Cooke, a mercantile company that
eventually became part of the Dole produce company. One of the
reasons he's being held on no bail is authorities' fear he could
post a multimillion-dollar cash bond.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said the man he knew never talked about money or
pineapples. He did mention that he'd traveled all over the world.
But he certainly never mentioned anything about a boat fire in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Castle and his first wife, Frances, lived in a
West Palm Beach marina aboard a 28-foot ketch that Castle built
himself and named the ``Keuwa,'' Hawaiian for ``vagabond.'' When
daughter Lisa Ann was born in 1967, they flew a diaper from the
mast, according to published reports.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, the couple separated and fell into a nasty divorce. The
boat was registered to Frances Castle but in June 1970, Sam Castle
claimed he'd bought it for $10. A short time later he insured it
for $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   On Labor Day 1970, the Kuewa burned after an explosion in a boat
yard. Castle and another woman, go-go dancer Mary Patricia Kirby,
were thrown into the water and badly injured.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, both were charged with arson and conspiracy.
Prosecutors contended the explosion was the result of a botched
arson attempt. On Sept. 29, Kirby died. Castle was not charged in
her death.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, a jury convicted him of arson, conspiracy to commit a
felony and distribution of a flammable substance with intent to
burn. He remained free on $10,000 bond during his appeal. When the
U.S. Supreme Court rejected his final appeal five years later,
Castle took off.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years after that, a Sam Coleman _ a giant of a man like
Castle _ was arrested in British Columbia on an immigration
violation. But the man wasn't talking so Canadian authorities asked
for fingerprint identification. When a snowstorm in Washington,
D.C., prevented an FBI agent from getting Castle's prints to
Vancouver in time, the man was released from a British Columbia
jail.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian authorities say Castle and his girflriend at the time,
Linda Sue King from Tallahassee, Fla., drove off in a van headed
for the Canadian mountains. The couple eventually abandoned the
van, then walked into the woods, never to be seen, published
reports say.
</P>
<P>
   Reports and sightings over the years have placed Castle in the
Philippines and in Alaska working as a lumberjack.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, the Seattle Area Fugitive Apprehension Team got a
tip _ authorities refuse to elaborate on the source _ that Castle's
wife, Linda, would be flying to Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport from Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport, authorities say, she changed clothes and drove a
rental car in circles to lose anyone who might be tailing her.
Eventually she led authorities to Castle's home on 61st Avenue, a
winding, hilly road that ends on a bluff overlooking a seaplane
marina along Lake Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Castle's wife wouldn't comment for this story.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Henderson said, he tried to visit his neighbor in
jail but wasn't able to see him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's been a model citizen,'' Henderson said. ``Why don't
they back off?''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Hamilton, an assistant U.S. attorney in Seattle, said
Castle's case isn't so cut and dried. If Castle hadn't taken off 21
years ago, he added, he probably would have served his time and
been back on the streets by now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not like The Fugitive, where an innocent man is on the
run. We're not looking for a One-Armed Man,'' Hamilton said,
referring to the popular television series and movie. ``He was
sentenced to 10 years in prison, and he ran. What else can you say?

 &HT;    The two sides of celibacy: Is it liberating, or limiting?
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The Rev. Louis Guerin has 64 first
cousins. His mother was one of 20 children. The idea of family for
Guerin is a crowd of relatives big enough to fill the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But as parents and grandparents at such a gathering might recite
the names of their brood, Guerin would have to be satisfied to be
an observer. He had to promise not to have a family of his own when
he became a Roman Catholic priest almost 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic Church insists that its priests be celibate.
They can never marry and must abstain from all sexual
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   That decision was a struggle for Guerin, 46, who is the pastor
of St. Lucy Church in Highland Park. He wanted a family. He worried
about being lonely as a single man. But he found celibacy to be a
gift that freed him to embrace his congregation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to realize that family is far more than just your own
offspring,'' Guerin said. ``Celibacy is a different form of loving.
It's really loving in a dimension that supersedes human touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, required celibacy remains a controversial subject.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a sex scandal breaks in the Roman Catholic Church, some
critics inevitably blame celibacy. The recent resignation of Bishop
Keith Symons has them talking.
</P>
<P>
   Symons left the top job in the Diocese of Palm Beach last week,
confessing to inappropriate sexual activity with young boys more
than 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But celibacy doesn't cause pedophilia. And marriage won't
prevent it. Bishop Robert Lynch, who is the apostolic administrator
of the diocese, called Symons' behavior a disease. Others call it a
disorder. Celibacy is a lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celibacy does not lead to pedophilia,'' said Debra Haffner,
president of SIECUS, an international clearinghouse on human
sexuality in New York that promotes sexuality education. ``Nor does
celibacy lead to homosexuality. Nor does it lead to other
aggressive social acts or mental illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Celibacy is a perfectly legitimate choice to abstain from sex
with other people, Haffner said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Roman Catholic Church requires it, and many clergy think
they should have the option of choosing married or celibate life.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Hugh Duffy, pastor of Sacred Heart Church in
Okeechobee, is happy as a celibate priest but thinks it should not
be required of all clergy.
</P>
<P>
   He struggled with the need to give up marriage and children as a
seminarian, he said, but discovered that celibate life was an
honest choice as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gift,'' Duffy said. ``It takes a special kind of
personality to be single and emotionally and spiritually fulfilled.
That's why it shouldn't be obligatory in the priesthood.''
</P>
<P>
   The church can change its policy. A celibate priesthood is not
biblically based nor seen as a divinely ordered way of life, Duffy
said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Roman Harmas is a married deacon who assists at Duffy's
church. Harmas comes from the Ukrainian Catholic Church that has
been in union with the church in Rome for 450 years but allows
married clergy, Duffy said.
</P>
<P>
   The choice to be married was available in the early church.
Universal celibacy was required only in the 11th century, and that
was done more to protect the church's property than the priest's
virtue.
</P>
<P>
   The practice grew slowly. In the fourth century, there were
fewer ways to demonstrate the depth of your faith. The church was
legal and had become the religion of the state. No one had to give
their life for Jesus. Christians were no longer sent to the lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once there were no more martyrs, a great sign of commitment
was a religious life with perpetual chastity,'' said the Rev.
Charles Curran, a Roman Catholic priest and professor of human
values at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Celibacy became a way of bearing witness to your faith. It also
became a way of ducking that nasty reality called sex.
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars of the early church taught that the body and its
functions were less than good and sex was fraught with the danger
of sin.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be really pleasing to God, you gave up sex,'' said Eugene
Bianchi, professor of religion at Emory University in Atlanta.
Bianchi is a former Jesuit priest who left the ministry and got
married. ``There was something about sex that was disorderly and
led you to sin. You used it only to have children.''
</P>
<P>
   Celibacy became a popular choice. Soon bishops began to require
it. Local councils called for it, Curran said.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until the early 11th century that Pope Benedict
VIII made celibacy the norm throughout the church, he said. And the
pope did that to prevent clergy from passing ownership of the
church's property to their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Benedict VIII enacted legislation (about celibacy) to protect
the lands of the church,'' Curran said. ``He did it because of the
money aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   And, later, the church used celibacy as a way of highlighting
the differences between Catholic and Protestant, Bianchi said.
</P>
<P>
   The church reinforced its demands for a celibate clergy after
the Reformation in the 16th century when Protestant ministers were
allowed to marry, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, celibacy is a gift for many clergy that offers
opportunity for service and a way to be available to a larger
family without the demands of a biological family.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at celibacy as a discipline, it becomes a
hardship,'' Guerin said. ``If you see it as a liberty, it becomes
extremely liberating. It allows you to be part of every family.''
</P>
<P>
   Many clergy have left the ministry to marry, and others may
clamor for the right to do so and remain a priest, but Guerin is
happy in the celibate life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Holy Father allowed priests to marry tomorrow, I don't
think I'd start dating,'' he said.

 &HT;    Father uses laws to his advantage in childnapping case
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Amy Habie has seen her twins, Danny and
Alexandra, only once since April 13, 1992. A few cards, an
occasional phone conversation, that's it. And on each of the six
Mother's Days since they disappeared, no calls, no cards.
</P>
<P>
   They were just 2 when their father, Joey Habie, took them from
their Boca Raton, Fla. home, loaded them onto his private Lear jet
in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. and flew them to his home in Guatemala.
And kept them.
</P>
<P>
   The children sleep, eat, play and go to school watched by guards
armed with submachine guns. Their mother cannot phone or visit
them. Their father is a textile magnate who has bought his children
the best protection money can buy.
</P>
<P>
   The moment she knew the kids were gone, Amy Habie's life took a
sickening downward turn. Her ride since has been just as stomach
wrenching _ but for reasons that go far beyond the pain of having
nothing but photos and memories of her children.
</P>
<P>
   While virtually all parental kidnappers hide from the law, Joey
Habie uses the law as a club.
</P>
<P>
   He is wanted in the United States on charges of parental
kidnapping. Miami, Fla. FBI agent Fred Rivero says he is a prisoner
in his own country. But Joey is, in fact, totally free to run his
business, enjoy his children and harass Amy. From his mansion in
Guatemala, Joey or his proxies have filed 11 lawsuits in Florida
and U.S. courts against Amy Habie. All were dismissed either for
lack of merit or through default by Joey.
</P>
<P>
   In an April 1996 opinion, the 4th District Court of Appeal, held
that ``there is only one conclusion that can be drawn from this
case, and that is that Mr. Habie intends to use his financial
resources to punish not only his former wife, but her lawyers as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The opinion went on to castigate Joey Habie's Florida lawyers
for filing such suits and stated that the Florida Bar could
determine whether any lawyers were being used to ``muscle'' Amy.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Habie was satisfied with the court's finding but has paid
lawyers more than $2 million _ almost half her divorce settlement _
to defend herself. The money is meaningless, she says. There is no
price tag for the cost of lost time.
</P>
<P>
   Each suit Joey files is a numbing reminder of what and who she
has lost. Each suit drains her. Each suit appears to be Joey's way
of tormenting Amy, says a former cop who tried to track Joey down.
</P>
<P>
   Jose ``Joey'' Habie is a singular parental kidnapper. Hundreds
of children each year are snatched by parents and taken overseas,
says Nancy Hammer of the National Center For Missing and Exploited
Children in Washington, D.C. Almost 900 kids are being hidden
overseas by a parent. Usually the kids and the abducting parent
simply disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Habie is the only parental kidnapper Hammer knows of who
flaunts his fugitive status. He does it in U.S. and state courts,
through the U.S. mail and by selling his textiles in the U.S.
through hard-to-trace subsidiary companies.
</P>
<P>
   Money, big money, is the source of Joey Habie's power. The FBI
says he is worth more than $600 million, perhaps a billion. His
textile companies have annual sales in excess of $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his money and power landed him an appointment as
special prosecutor in Guatemala. His first official act was to
issue a warrant for the arrest of Amy Habie on contempt charges,
with attempted murder, adultery and abandonment charges thrown in.
Then he asked the U.S. State Department to extradite Amy to
Guatemala. It refused.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he remains wanted in the U.S. on state and federal
charges for interstate flight to avoid prosecution and parental
kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach, Fla. County Circuit Court found Joey to be so in
contempt of U.S. law it levied a $5 million dollar fine against him
_ $5 million per week as long as he does not return the children.
That was in 1994. Neither a penny nor the children have seen U.S.
soil since that ruling.
</P>
<P>
   This might look like the all-time championship case of he
says/she says, but Joey's letters to Amy, court rulings and
investigators tell a story full of ironies. This is a case of a
hard working and successful family man, a man who dotes on his
children, a highly educated man.
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of a man who wants to punish his ex-wife in the
worst way possible.
</P>
<P>
   His ex-wife, Amy Habie, 37, says she wants only one thing, and
it's not her children back under the original terms of the divorce
agreement that awarded her custodial status. She'll give up her
custodial rights in order to just have visitation and a chance to
develop some, any kind of relationship with the children.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Habie says:
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't want Joey punished.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't want his money.
</P>
<P>
   She will drop all charges _ and the FBI said that if the charges
are dropped, case closed. Even the fines levied against Joey will
be rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   All she wants is to be a part-time mother on any terms Joey
sets, other than no terms at all, no children at all. No life at
all.
</P>
<P>
   They had a life once, Joey and Amy.
</P>
<P>
   They met in Boca Raton just before Christmas 1983. She was Amy
Weil then, 22, a Michigan transplant and recent graduate of two
master's programs at the University of Florida _ business and
health administration.
</P>
<P>
   He was 25, held an MBA from Wharton. She was pretty, he
handsome. Both smart. Both workaholics.
</P>
<P>
   Four dinner dates in 10 days and they were engaged. On June 30,
1984, they were married.
</P>
<P>
   Joey flew a twin-engine Beechcraft then. In the months before
the marriage, he'd fly Amy to Guatemala or fly up to Gainesville,
Fla. to visit her. Amy moved to Guatemala after the wedding. She
spoke no Spanish. It was a cultural shock for a Midwestern girl,
she says, but she liked the pace of their lives, the demands of
business, the 70-hour work weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Joey owned Liztex, the family textile company he had inherited
when his father was shot down in the streets of Guatemala City a
few years earlier. Nobody knows who shot the senior Habie, but
Guatemala can be a dangerous place for people of wealth. Joey
surrounded himself and his bride with armed guards. They worked
hard, played hard, skiing at Aspen, traveling the Caribbean and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   They split their time between Guatemala and Boca Raton, where
they bought a $400,000 house to be near Amy's mother and Joey's
sister.
</P>
<P>
   Life was good. The twins were born November 17, 1989. Life got
better, but Amy says she began to realize that Joey ruled his
family like he ruled his business. By fear. Amy says he never hit
her, but Joey launched various household items in her direction
over small transgressions. His black moods and outbursts grew more
frequent.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1991, Joey and Amy had a major fight over their
miniature schnauzer. The fight escalated overnight into a crisis.
The dog had gone blind. Joey wanted to put it down. Amy wanted to
save it. Joey left the house and spent the night at his office.
</P>
<P>
   When Amy drove up to the office the next morning, the armed
guards at the gate told her she was not welcome. When she
persisted, the guards told her Joey had sent word for her to take
the children and leave. He didn't want any of them.
</P>
<P>
   That's crazy, she told the guards. She told them she would not
leave until Joey spoke to her. Then they shot out the tires on her
Mercedes. She drove on rims for about a half mile, ditched the car
and called friends for help.
</P>
<P>
   The twins' nanny, Sarah Brown, 65, who now lives in Miami,
remembers the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amy came back from the office crying, very afraid. She had
left her car near the office, and friends took her home. She said
we had to pack, had to leave on the first flight. She said she was
afraid Joey was going to kill somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Amy and the twins and Sarah Brown and the blind dog and 18
suitcases of clothes and diapers and toys ended up at U.S. Customs
in Miami 12 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joey was a good man,'' says Sarah Brown. ``But, oh my, he had
a temper. There always was danger under the surface. When (the
guards) shot Amy's car, it was time to go.''
</P>
<P>
   After fleeing to Florida from Guatemala, Amy filed for divorce.
Within three months _ February 1992 _ it was final. The deal took
only three days to work out. Amy gained custody of the children.
Joey was to set up a $3 million trust for the twins' support. Amy
got a check for $5 million and the houses in Boca Raton and
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   There was no trial, no trouble. Post-divorce life went smoothly.
Briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Joey visited the children soon after the divorce in accordance
with the agreement. Money for Amy and the children was in the
process of being transferred into U.S. bank accounts. The kids
played with their toys on the front lawn, where Amy videotaped
them. Life was peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Amy's trial by ordeal began.
</P>
<P>
   April 13, 1992. Amy was in Colorado. The kids were in Boca Raton
with Sarah Brown, and Amy had given Joey permission to see them,
even stay at the house if he desired. Joey packed the kids into his
car, said they were going to Parrot Jungle in Miami for the day.
</P>
<P>
   By evening they were in Guatemala. Joey called Brown. I have the
kids, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown called Amy. He took the babies, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Amy called the police.
</P>
<P>
   But parental kidnapping isn't a cut and dried matter. Was Joey
within his rights? Was he in criminal or civil contempt of the law?
Or neither?
</P>
<P>
   It took two years for the charge of parental kidnapping to be
filed and more than two years for the U.S. State Department to ask
Guatemala to return the children _ and Joey. Guatemala refused.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI continued the hunt. Agent Bill Thurman, now retired,
says the FBI was waiting for Joey to take the kids to any one of 48
countries that honored the Hague convention on international child
abduction. If he did that, says Thurman, the FBI might have been
able to grab the kids.
</P>
<P>
   But Joey never took them to a cooperating country, and the FBI
has no jurisdiction in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Joey, as a newly appointed special prosecutor in
Guatemala, asked the U.S. to extradite Amy to his country.
</P>
<P>
   When that failed, he took his case to Amy's neighbors via U.S.
mail.
</P>
<P>
   All of her neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   He blanketed the town with fliers. Bulk mail.
</P>
<P>
   The fliers Joey mailed are essentially correct, says Amy. Yes,
she had an affair. Yes, she had smoked marijuana, if that's what
Joey meant by drug use. Yes, she hired a private investigator to
check out the prospects of snatching her kids back from Guatemala.
No, she never plotted to kill Joey.
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, any semblance of reason was long gone from Joey's and
Amy's story. The fliers were flying, and so were the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   From his Guatemalan sanctuary, Joey has used proxies _ including
his mother _ to sue Amy 11 times in state and federal court. Every
one of the lawsuits was dismissed, most as groundless. The
litigation began just a month after he took the kids and continued
through 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Joey sued Amy. He sued Amy's mother. He sued Amy's lawyers. He
sued through companies he controlled. His mother sued, claiming she
owned companies that Amy had defrauded.
</P>
<P>
   Joey's tactics included having subpoenas issued for everything.
He would fax messages by the dozens to Amy and her lawyer, and then
subpoena the messages. He sent dozens of overnight air packages
containing a single photo of the children to Amy and her lawyers.
If they didn't sign and pay for the package, he would claim Amy did
not care about the children.
</P>
<P>
   Amy's legal bills mounted. But her faith in the courts remained
secure until she began to suspect Joey had gotten to the guardian
ad litem appointed to assess the children's needs.
</P>
<P>
   The court told Joey to pay for the costs of the guardian ad
litem, and did he ever _ more than $300,000. The court said that
was far more than usual in such cases. The guardian asked his
brother, a New York psychologist, to produce a report on the
children. The report said the kids were better off with Joey.
</P>
<P>
   This was too much for Amy. It was too much for the circuit court
judge who dismissed the guardian in June 1993. Judge John L.
Phillips' order said, in part, that the actions of the guardian ad
litem ``smack of overreaching and opportunism in this instance,
throwing the office of Guardian Ad Litem into suspicion and
disrepute.'' The court found the guardian ad litem had become ``a
surrogate for the former husband in this litigation and can no
longer be said to be acting solely on behalf of the children, or in
their best interests.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Joey came at Amy with other tactics:
</P>
<P>
   In his letters to Amy's lead attorney, James Fox Miller (whom
Joey addressed as James F--- Miller), Joey referred to the April 13
anniversary of the kidnapping as ``April Fools Day.''
</P>
<P>
   He blanketed Boca Raton, Fla. with another flier.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote Amy a soothing letter saying it was time to put an end
to the fight and reunite the family; he followed up with a letter
saying: Some other time.
</P>
<P>
   He poured forth such a stream of legal documents and personal
correspondence that Amy needs a walk-in closet to store it all. She
keeps the most cynical letters in a thick folder she calls the
nasty file.
</P>
<P>
   And Joey kept suing.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 56, an experienced trial lawyer and former head of the
Florida Bar Association, couldn't keep Joey at bay. He'd get one
suit dismissed, and within weeks a new one would be filed in
another court. So, Miller asked an old law school friend, David
Boies, to help.
</P>
<P>
   Boies' specialty is federal racketeering law _ under the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO.
That's the law that deals with using the mails, phones and
computers to extort, harass, defraud or cause financial ruin. The
statutes can be applied in criminal or civil cases.
</P>
<P>
   He currently is a U.S. Justice Department lead lawyer in the
Microsoft suit (an anti-trust, not RICO matter). He saw Joey's
suits as an inversion of the legal system, an ongoing RICO
violation taking place in the very courtrooms dedicated to
enforcing those statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Boies sued Joey and Joey's mother, Sara, who had filed some of
the suits. He sued Joey's proxies in federal courts in New York and
Miami. He claimed they were trying to destroy Amy financially by
abusing the U.S. court system.
</P>
<P>
   He won. In January, a Miami jury found Sara Habie guilty of
violating civil RICO law and awarded Amy $21 million in damages. As
with other judgments against Joey, this one has gone unheeded and
unpaid.
</P>
<P>
   So, Boies says his next step is to squeeze Joey where it hurts _
his American sales of textiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Joey Habie has a nickel in assets anywhere in the United
States, we're going to find it and ask that it be seized,'' says
Boies. He's working for Amy pro bono, but with a 30 percent
contingency if Joey ever pays his fines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd make a lot of money, millions, if Joey ever paid,'' says
Boies, ``but I'm not doing this for the money. I'm doing it because
Joey Habie has dragged our legal system through filth.''
</P>
<P>
   After the kidnapping, Amy tried to lead as normal a life as
possible. She started a landscape design and maintenance business.
She bought some assets from another landscaping business belonging
to Scott and Carol Lewis of West Palm Beach. She had not known the
Lewises before.
</P>
<P>
   As happens in some business dealings, both parties thought the
other party was breaching the contract. Amy and the Lewises took
each other to court. She says they broke the non-compete contract;
they say she failed to make payments. The case is in progress.
</P>
<P>
   None of their dealings involved Joey or the children. But then,
Amy Habie says, something strange happened.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Lewis relayed a message from Joey to Amy. In a November
1997 sworn deposition, Lewis said the message was: ``Joe wants Amy
to know that he's adopting the children.''
</P>
<P>
   The message was as revealing as it was stunning, says Amy. It
meant Joey was in touch with Carol Lewis. It had to mean that Joey
was in the background of this lawsuit, trying to punish her, Amy
feels.
</P>
<P>
   David Boies agreed. He filed a RICO suit against the Lewises in
federal court. It is ongoing. He has asked for their phone records
to prove his assertion that Joey is coaching them.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by phone, Carol Lewis said, ``Amy is a hateful and
manipulative person.'' As for Joey, Joey is not coaching her,
helping her or influencing her, Carol Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Lewis says Amy's claims that Joey and the Lewises are in
league with each other are false.
</P>
<P>
   But Carol Lewis confirmed contact with Joey in her sworn
deposition. She confirmed that Joey had faxed to her copies of
birthday cards Amy had sent the twins. She said she thinks Amy is
trying to alienate the twins from Joey. She confirmed the remark
about the adoption and apologized for it.
</P>
<P>
   And Amy Habie? Hateful and manipulative?
</P>
<P>
   Bill Thurman, the former FBI agent, says he's satisfied Amy
Habie is nothing more than a woman with the wrong ex-husband.
``She's anything but the devil. She's just a good woman who's has
been put through hell,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And Joey?
</P>
<P>
   Reached by phone at his Guatemala office, Joey said he had
nothing to say until it's over.
</P>
<P>
   When would it be over?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Does he think Amy has a right to a relationship with her
children?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, sure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Does he know that Amy says all she wants is to see her kids
before they're grown?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's been six years since Danny and Alexandra disappeared. The
video Amy made of them on the front lawn and some old photos are
all she has left.
</P>
<P>
   She took their cribs from their bedroom a couple of years ago.
The twin beds she put in have never been slept in. The walk-in
closet is filled with court records and subpoenas. The twins' old
toys _ infant toys they long since have outgrown _ share a shelf
with their father's hate mail.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Amy waits for the next lawsuit, the next mass mailing,
the latest rumor about herself. Every so often, she watches the old
video of the kids playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to watch, but it's all I have,'' she says.
``When they're older, they can come here and learn the truth. Even
Joey can't stop them from growing up.

 &HT;    Marilyn Geewax's Business Commentary: Traditional manufacturing
jobs now just a 'blip' in U.S. economy
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Henry Ford announced in 1914 that he would pay $5
for eight hours of factory work, other business owners attacked his
radicalism. They feared that by paying twice the going rate for
unskilled labor, Ford would spoil workers and bankrupt employers.
</P>
<P>
   But the early industrialist realized that to sell his cars in
large numbers, he would have to help create a middle class of
well-paid workers. Unions embraced Ford's idea, using it to argue
for higher wages at all auto plants.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, that argument made good sense. As the ranks of
autoworkers expanded and their paychecks increased, the economy
blossomed. By 1952, roughly 700,000 U.S. factory workers were
building cars and using their healthy wages to buy autos, homes and
appliances. That samep create a middle class of well-paid workers.
Unions embraced Ford's idea, using it to argue for higher wages at
all auto plants.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, that argument made good sense. As the ranks of
autoworkers expanded and their paychecks increased, the economy
blossomed. By 1952, roughly 700,000 U.S. factory workers were
building cars and using their healthy wages to buy autos, homes and
appliances. That same year, General Motors President Charles Wilson
declared: ``What was good for our country was also good for General
Motors, and vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   Autoworkers still insist that their above-average wages are
vital to a robust economy. But they are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   While hundreds of thousands of Americans continue to work in the
auto industry, their role has diminished dramatically. The rest of
the U.S. economy has grown so mightily that what's good for GM and
its workers no longer matters very much.
</P>
<P>
   This point was driven home last week when the United Auto
Workers' strike at a key GM metal stamping plant in Flint, Mich.,
began spreading and crippling other GM operations. At GM's
Doraville plant, the strike forced the company to cancel planned
overtime and brace for a possible shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, a big auto strike would have generated front-page
headlines nationwide. When the UAW and GM battled in 1970, the
entire economy took a beating. But today, experts are describing
the overall impact of the GM strike as ``a blip'' that will
scarcely slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But how could a company as big as GM be so puny in its economic
impact? Don't we still need autoworkers' wages to help keep the
middle class strong?
</P>
<P>
   Answers to those questions could be found last week in downtown
Atlanta, at the Supercomm '98 trade show. The gathering, which
featured all sorts of communications devices, drew about 45,000
people and underscored how fast new jobs are being created outside
the traditional industrial base.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, a ``telephone'' trade show would have been a
yawner. Today, a ``telecommunications'' convention is dazzling. The
booths offered jaw-dropping displays of equipment involving the
Internet, satellite communications, computer telephony, fiber
optics and much more.
</P>
<P>
   One of the companies participating in Supercomm was General
Motors.
</P>
<P>
   A car company at a telecom show?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. GM had representatives explaining OnStar, an advanced
communications device that can dial a cellular phone on voice
command, use the satellite-based Global Positioning System to
locate your vehicle, automatically dial 911 when air bags deploy,
unlock the car doors by remote control and just about kiss you good
night.
</P>
<P>
   While GM factory workers were striking in Flint, GM employees at
Supercomm were describing how they could turn your car into a
rolling communications center.
</P>
<P>
   And to keep all these new telecom devices working, thousands and
thousands of good-paying jobs are being created all over the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, many communities are still very dependent upon auto
plant wages to support their local economies. In Flint, the GM
strike is far more than a ``blip.'' But for most of the country,
manufacturing jobs no longer serve as the middle class' mainstay.
So many new types of jobs are being created that the melting away
of traditional factory jobs hardly matters to the economy anymore.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Small fish are bigger in a small pond
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio. A few years ago when I was editing a
small-town newspaper, we ran a letter from a reader wanting to
share her
</P>
<P>
   grandmother's cure for arthritis - raisins soaked in gin. ``Eat
six a day. Use a cheap gin,'' she advised, ``but don't drink it.''
</P>
<P>
   We ran the letter on our Village Views page and in short order
the testimonials began pouring in. ``It works,'' one reader
enthused. ``Joint swelling is down and my ankles have begun to move
again. Only problem is my mother-in-law helped herself to some of
my `medicine' and now I suspect she's drinking the gin. What should
I do?''
</P>
<P>
   We heard from readers as far away as Florida and Arizona (where
many of our subscribers spent the winter), praising the cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hallelujah!'' wrote one retiree. ``I've tried it and the
swelling in my index finger has gone down, my knees are working
again, and I'm going dancing once a week. I feel like a teenager.''
</P>
<P>
   Another time we ran a letter from a lady explaining to the
readers why her name appeared so often in the Blotter (police calls
section). ``I'm not doing anything wrong, I just need the officer
to stop by ever (sic) so often to get God out of my kitchen. He's
in there waiting to jump out and scare me so that nice policeman,
the skinny one whose momma was a Sanderson before she married,
comes and gets God out of there so I can have my bedtime coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Folks in small towns like to open up the paper and see a picture
of somebody they know - even if it's a shadowy figure standing
outside a burning barn at 3 a.m. And everyone enjoys reading about
the latest escapades of Squirt, the Lutheran minister's Great Dane,
who wanders through town looking for a car ride back home. Squirt
isn't picky. He'll ride with anybody, anywhere. Folks have to be
quick loading groceries at the corner market or old Squirt will
gallop up and, in one leap followed by a slow turnaround, settle
himself in the passenger's seat of any car with an open door,
grinning and panting in anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   Small town folks have a tough time with big town news. That's
why we live here and not there, because we really don't want to
hear about things like a New York City public school teacher being
attacked by four sixth-grade students because she wouldn't allow
them to watch the Jerry Springer Show on a classroom television.
It's tough for us to imagine four little girls (11 and 12) who've
barely outgrown their Barbies, slapping, kicking, punching, and
spitting on their 44-year-old teacher because she nixed Springer's
``Bisexual Relationships Hurt Married Couples'' show in favor of an
educational presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, something grabs us like the story of a Georgia
lawmaker who proposed arming teachers in order to prevent school
</P>
<P>
   shootings. Those of us in the teaching business had a good
giggle picturing ourselves taking morning attendance with a
six-iron strapped
</P>
<P>
   on our hips or drawing down on young Sammy when he came to class
without his homework.
</P>
<P>
   Can't recall anybody in particular being upset because French
wine is coming out in pop-top cans; California vintage is about as
exotic as we get around here. And few of us have heard of Elizabeth
Hurley and even fewer care that she went to a wedding in England
wearing a red Versace dress slit up to her...well...leopard-print
skivvies.
</P>
<P>
   We're not particularly happy that Pakistan and India have THE
bomb. Truth of the matter is, we're not too happy that
(ITAL)anybody(END ITAL) has THE bomb. One of my neighbors offered
his solution to the arms race. ``Let's equipt everyone with
laughing gas and he who laughs longest and loudest wins the war.''
</P>
<P>
   We don't care that Carol Channing only had sex twice in 41
years. In fact, one of my farmer buddies commented: ``Gawd! It took
her long enough to catch on.'' He also commented on the NASCAR
driver who had a sex change and is now driving as a girl. ``Who the
hell cares as long as he doesn't change his name? Can't picture
myself cheering for some driver named Crystal.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, even though we're more interested in crop yields
than C-Span, we've not recently fallen off of the south end of a
northbound turnip truck. There is no way we're believing the R.J.
Reynolds spokesman who insists, ``In truth, we made sure Joe Camel
did not appeal to kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The real news of the world is on tree-lined, shady streets just
like ours. It's proud grandparents pushing strollers, and kids with
ball
</P>
<P>
   gloves headed for the park. And occasionally, it's a cure for
arthritis, a car-crazy Great Dane, and a friendly policeman who's
willing to take God for a ride.
</P>
<P>
   Small towns like small news.

 &HT;    Cyberscene: Sedentary surfers can find fitness tips
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's something a little silly about turning to your
PC for advice about exercise. After all, if you didn't spend so
danged much time sitting at the keyboard, cruising the Web and
sending e-mail, you'd get outside more.
</P>
<P>
   But since the PC and the Internet are facts of life now, you
might as well use some of the resources of the World Wide Web to
find ways to get in shape.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start our Web-based exercise program easy. Just click that
mouse button -- don't strain yourself -- on http://www
</P>
<P>
   .tyrell.net/(tilde)fitness/ and zap on over to World Fitness
Online. This is a good place to start, because you'll probably
agree with the philosophy here. The notion, according to this page,
is:
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is a precious commodity, as is fitness. We want to remain
fit, but we also need time to do other things with our lives. Some
people put fitness ahead of everything else and become gym rats,
spending endless hours pumping iron, running treadmills, doing
Nautilus circuits, etc. But most of us want real lives beyond the
gym.''
</P>
<P>
   The practical nature of this page also extends to the sort of
features you'll find. If you want to get in shape without spending
a lot of money, you'll be able to follow the directions here for
constructing some of your own exercise equipment, including a
wooden stair device. It isn't as fancy as the step machines you'll
find in the gym, but you won't need to spend your hard-earned money
to get one. And, since you'll build the wooden stepper yourself,
you'll get your first exercise just from constructing it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as you'd expect, there are sections that offer exercise
advice, as well as a forum where you can leave questions for the
exercise experts who hang around this site.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop on our exercise circuit is at a place called the
Fitness Partner Connection Jumpsite. You'll find it at http://
</P>
<P>
   primusweb.com
</P>
<P>
   /fitnesspartner/. You already know that exercise alone isn't
enough for good personal fitness, so the emphasis of this site on
diet and eating the right foods will fit right in with your fitness
plan.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also get the sometimes-depressing news here of how many
calories you're burning while engaged in various exercise
activities. That's because there's a high-tech calculator that lets
you enter the information about your exercise program and get a
fairly accurate indication of the calories you burn.
</P>
<P>
   You probably know all about personal trainers. That's the rage
now at the gym. These folks help you set up an exercise plan and
health goals based on your age, weight, physical condition and
personal goals. Well, now it's time for you to meet a virtual
personal trainer that can do almost the same thing. Just head for a
site called The Fitness Zone: Fitness Profile at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .fitnesszone.com/profiles/.
</P>
<P>
   You'll fill out the on-screen form with the same kind of
information you'd give a real-world personal trainer and, in just
seconds, get an exercise profile and an assessment of your current
fitness level. You'll need to know your blood pressure to fill out
the form, but you should know that anyway, since a visit to your
physician is strongly recommended before starting any new exercise
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Since -- right or wrong -- most of us associate a fitness plan
with losing weight, you'll want to stop by a site called Shape Up
America at http://www.shapeup
</P>
<P>
   .org/sua/. That's the emphasis here, losing weight safely.
You'll find advice and support -- along with cautions about trendy
diets.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, to get started on your fitness program, perform this
low-stress exercise. Reach out with your right finger, turn off
your computer and take a walk.

 &HT;    NetW(at)atch: Pitch to Slate subscribers
 &HT;    comes straight from top
 &HT;

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Beware of e-mail letters from celebrities. Unless they
are personal friends of yours, chances are they want something.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case with the letter sent by Slate Editor Michael
Kinsley to the Internet magazine's 20,000 subscribers. At first
they must have thought it was kind of cool to receive a personal
note from Kinsley -- or just plain old ``Mike'' to the few, proud
Slate subscribers who paid $19.95 a year to read the online
magazine backed by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Mike's message to the flock is a chatty little note talking
about some of the improvements he'd like to make to Slate
(http://www.slate.com), such as adding more content to the
informational e-mail packages already being sent to subscribers
upon request. He's also adding new columns, including a more
frequent advice column (edited by Ann Landers' daughter, no less)
and a Wall Street insider column called ``Moneybox.'' Mike is even
planning to let readers listen in on the daily conferences between
the magazine's editors and writers, which ought to be fun. This
frenzy of content development is good news for Slate subscribers,
who will get more as part of their subscription.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually Kinsley gets to the real reason for his e-mail.
He notes with some pride the 20,000 subscribers. But as a slew of
analysts and pundits and even Slate itself readily admits, that's
not enough to keep a high-quality Web magazine afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate times call for desperate measures. Kinsley, once the
famous ``voice from the left'' on CNN's ``Crossfire,'' quotes such
famous conservatives as Fox News' Brit Hume and William F. Buckley
Jr. as saying how much they love Slate. Dark days, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   But then he moves in for the kill. It's not enough you have
subscribed to Slate. Kinsley asks you to persuade all your friends
to subscribe. Once you persuade a few people, send Slate the names
of friends who promised they'd subscribe, along with their e-mail
addresses. If you can persuade your pals to subscribe for at least
eight weeks, you'll get six months added to your own Slate
subscription. And if you don't want to hassle your friends into
subscribing, Kinsley has another idea -- give them a gift
subscription!
</P>
<P>
   Is it an outrage to send this kind of e-mail asking subscribers
to hook their friends? Not at all, says Thom Weidlich, senior
writer for Direct, a direct-marketing trade magazine. He says its
not spam because the direct-marketing pitch was sent to Slate
subscribers who have a relationship with the publication and are
used to receiving e-mail from Slate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem with the letter,'' he says. ``I have a
problem with the approach of the letter.'' He questioned how Slate
would be able to track which new subscribers were referred by which
current subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the final analysis, Kinsley's letter may be annoying,
misleading, complicated and a bit silly. But it is a bona fide way
to solicit new subscribers. It may not work, but that's one of the
things that makes Slate a charming enterprise despite its corporate
ties to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Slate's continual experimentation and willingness to admit and
learn from its mistakes is a breath of fresh air amid a sea of
content developers endlessly pretending they have all the answers.
Slate's willingness to throw almost anything up against the wall to
see if it sticks makes it one of the most interesting Web ventures
on the Web -- and nothing at all like parent company Microsoft.

<P>
   TVSURFER-COLUMN _ PBS's ``POV'' airs the excellent ``The Band,''
a Decatur filmmaker's poignant documentary about teen life through
the eyes of members of Decatur High School's band _ it looks deeply
at coping with death, eating disorders, drug use, race relations.
Grade: A- (show airs this night on WGTV and on Wednesday on WAPB);
plus it's start of MTV's ``The Real World'' in Seattle. (Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) ETA 8 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIE-REVIEWS _ Capsule reviews of recently released movies.
``Almost Heroes'' _ ``Woo.'' (Hamilton, Murray, Ringel, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED 6/12.
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE (l category)
</P>
<P>
   CELIBACY-DEBATE _ The Roman Catholic Church insists that its
priests be celibate. They can never marry and must abstain from all
sexual relationships. That decision was a struggle for the Rev.
Louis Guerin , 46, who is the pastor of St. Lucy Church in Highland
Park, Florida. But he found celibacy to be a gift that freed him to
embrace his congregation, he said. (Gushee, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   CASTLE-FUGITIVE _ After 21 years and a few near-misses, their
search was over: The police say they had finally nabbed the elusive
Darion Northrup ``Sam'' Castle. (Capozzi, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   FATHER-KIDNAPPER _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Amy Habie has seen
her twins, Danny and Alexandra, only once since April 13, 1992. A
few cards, an occasional phone conversation, that's it. They were
just 2 when their father, Joey Habie, took them from their Boca
Raton, Fla. home, loaded them onto his private Lear jet in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. and flew them to his home in Guatemala. And kept
them. (Reid, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-CHRISTIAN _ FORT WORTH, Texas _ In a political year when
the GOP treats him as a political deity, about the only Republicans
who don't profess undying belief in Gov. George W. Bush are members
of the Christian Coalition. They are backing him for re-election,
but some are not ready to sign on for a possible Bush presidential
race. (Herman, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-GRADUATE _ Shortly after turning 9 years old, Julius Su
declared his intentions to the world. He said he would attend
prestigious Cal Tech, a university that claims 24 Nobel Prize
winners. He said he would pursue a career in science _ chemistry,
perhaps. And he assured all around him he was dead serious. Since
Julius Su was solving college-level calculus problems at 8 years
old, everybody naturally believed whatever he said at 9. (Moffett,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   HOMELESS-LAWSUIT _ MIAMI, Fla. _ Milton Finney might qualify for
a landmark settlement hammered out of a 1988 class action suit
against the city for harassing homeless people. Unlike many at
Camillus House one day this week, Finney, 58, has actually heard
about it, especially the part where he gets $1,250. He is, in fact,
already banking on it for his move to easy street. (Staletovich,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   ARTHUR-MURRAY _ If Arthur Murray were here today, he'd probably
use the Gap khaki commercial as a teaching tool. (Who needs a
footprint diagram when you have wiggling models doing the Lindy hop
to Louis Prima?) As Murray studios celebrate 85 years of
eliminating two left feet, ballroom dancing is becoming hip again -
thanks largely to TV and film. (Grantham, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NETWATCH _ATLANTA _ Beware of e-mail letters from celebrities.
Unless they are personal friends of yours, chances are they want
something. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSCENE _ ATLANTA _ There's something a little silly about
turning to your PC for advice about exercise. After all, if you
didn't spend so danged much time sitting at the keyboard, cruising
the Web and sending e-mail, you'd get outside more. But since the
PC and the Internet are facts of life now, you might as well use
some of the resources of the World Wide Web to find ways to get in
shape.(Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED. (l, f)
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE/MEDICINE (a and/or l category)
</P>
<P>
   HUMMINGBIRDS-STUDY _ A robot hummingbird would be a candidate
for what the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency calls micro
air vehicles: miniature reconnaissance aircraft that soldiers could
carry in their packs to safely find out what's over the next hill
and select targets for artillery or airstrikes. (Stanley, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.

GAY CATALOG COMPANY FINDS IT'S RIGHT AT HOME ... IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN GUTIERREZ-MIER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ What may be the world's largest lesbian and gay
mail-order department store isn't in New York City or San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   It is located in San Antonio on a tree-shaded block of East
Euclid Avenue. The company generates more than $1 million in
revenue each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our forerunner, Shocking Gray, was the world's first and only
lesbian and gay mail-order business when they opened in 1991,''
said Glenn Chase, president of ZEBRA'z. ``Shocking Gray opened a
lot of doors for us, and now we have suppliers contacting us
instead of the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Shocking Gray filed for bankruptcy in 1995. Chase and several
other investors have since taken over and operate the business and
showroom.
</P>
<P>
   The store draws visitors from across the country and a few
international customers. The 800-square-foot showroom is filled
with rainbow candles, flags, clothing, books, videos, greeting
cards and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   The company offers about 5,000 items through its catalog and Web
site. Chase hopes to double the number of catalogs its mails,
currently about 600,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Sex toys, Chase said, are not sold by the company, but it does
carry items such as cake-toppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our best sellers is the same-sex marriage
cake-topper,'' Chase said. He explained that the individual bride
and grooms come in a variety of ethnic backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have Anglo, Hispanic, African-American and Asian toppers,''
Chase said.
</P>
<P>
   Although gay marriages are not recognized in the United States,
gay and lesbian couples have commitment ceremonies. In San
Francisco, a gay and lesbian partnership ceremony is sponsored by
city officials.
</P>
<P>
   This month is especially busy for Chase and his employees. Gay
Pride is celebrated throughout June in many major cities.
</P>
<P>
   ZEBRA'z reach is international, Chase said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a growing business,'' he said. ``Last week we shipped to
Norway and Spain. Here in the United States, a large portion of our
business are rural orders.''
</P>
<P>
   John Struggs, owner of Earthly Pride in Hammond, Ind., said
ZEBRA'z is an asset to smaller communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We order anything related to pride from them, including pins,
jewelry and flags,'' said Struggs, whose store is located 50 miles
east of Chicago. ``Our prices are a little lower than Chicago. And
people don't have to drive all the way into the city to get gifts
and personal items.''
</P>
<P>
   Many ZEBRA'z customers are surprised to discover the company is
based in San Antonio, Chase said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think of San Francisco or New York City when it
comes to gay and lesbian civil rights,'' Chase said. ``San Antonio
is a good city to do business in, especially mail order business.
The overhead is low and it's a nice place to live.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The people have spoken. They say: No bilingual
education in California, por favor. English only. Pure English.
American English. For Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But the supporters of Proposition 227 did not go far enough. We
need not merely more English; we need better English. We need
Proposition 227, Part II: The Test.
</P>
<P>
   This calls for the immediate testing of all Californians who
voted in favor of Proposition 227 to determine their proficiency in
writing and speaking the English language: Natives, immigrants,
fifth-generation debutantes, everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The test will consist of four parts:
</P>
<P>
   _ Spelling: One hundred words will be selected at random from
last year's state spelling bee contest. If 12-year-old immigrants
can spell ``s-y-z-y-g-y'' correctly, the average Californian adult
should have no problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vocabulary: Native English speakers should breeze through this
portion of the test. Californians will be required to define common
English words, such as ``plaintive,'' ``laconic'' and ``fulsome,''
and use each in a sentence. Example of wrong answer: The plaintive
pleaded laconic but was sent to Fulsome Prison.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grammar: Here's the chance for native Californians to shine.
Topics will include the subjunctive mood, gerunds and passive
voice. Special emphasis will be placed on the differences between
``lie'' and ``lay'' and ``who'' and ``whom.''
</P>
<P>
   Improper use of a semicolon will result in a grade of zero. Tip
for Southern Californians: ``Mary,'' ``marry'' and ``merry'' are
pronounced differently.
</P>
<P>
   _ Writing: Test-takers will write a 500-word essay on one of the
following topics: review of five books read in the past year
(excluding cookbooks, celebrity biographies and home computer
manuals); rearing chI)

IN CHURCH VS. STATE, PAT ROBERTSON IS NO LAUGHING MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ha, ha, ha. That wacky Pat Robertson is at it
again. This time, the failed presidential candidate and right-wing
Christian TV preacher is predicting ``earthquakes, tornadoes and
possibly a meteor'' as God's answer to homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Railing on a segment of his weekday TV show, ``The 700 Club,''
Robertson opined at length about the annual Gay Days weekend at
Disney World and the rainbow-colored gay flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would warn Orlando that you're right in the way of some
serious hurricanes, and I don't think I'd be waving those flags in
God's face if I were you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ha, ha, ha.
</P>
<P>
   Last time it was the Equal Rights Amendment. When Iowa voters
considered a 1992 ballot measure that would have added it to the
state constitution, Roberts warned that the ERA was part of ``the
radical feminist agenda.'' And that agenda promotes ``a socialist,
anti-family, political movement that encourages women to leave
their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy
capitalism and become lesbians.''
</P>
<P>
   Ha, ha, ha.
</P>
<P>
   Except, the truth is, Pat Robertson is about as funny as a
truckload of nuclear waste being driven by a drunk on a foggy
mountain road.
</P>
<P>
   Some not-so-amusing facts:
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition, which Robertson founded in 1989 after
he lost a presidential bid, claims 1.8 million members, 1,900
chapters and a flow of more than $20 million in donations in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Its annual budget is $27 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still passing itself off as an ``educational and nonpartisan''
nonprofit organization that ``promotes public welfare,'' the
Coalition is one of the most powerful players in the Republican
Party. Yet, it pays no taxes. It is not subject to campaign
spending laws that apply to political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   Last September in Atlanta, Robertson was recorded in a closed
meeting of Coalition members, ruminating on his group's clout.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Congress, he said: ``Look, we put you in power in
1994, and we want you to deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreaming of the ideal presidential candidate, he said: ``We need
to come together on somebody who reflects our values and has the
stature to be president ... We need to be like a united front. I
know that all these laws say that we've got to be careful, but
there's nothing that says we can't have a few informal discussions
among ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. paid $1.7 billion for
Robertson's Family Entertainment Network. Robertson remained as
co-chairman of the company, his son as president and chief
executive. The network includes the Family Channel, the nation's
9th largest, which reaches 67 million homes.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network, which airs ``The 700
Club'' and reaches a million homes, owned 3.8 million shares of the
family entertainment stock. Robertson said the $136.1 million
realized by CBN's sale of stock would go toward a global TV
evangelism project. A stock-based trust established by Robertson
will net CBN an additional $109.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Regent University in Virginia, which Robertson also founded, got
$147 million for its 4.2 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1996, at a San Diego coalition rally where
Robertson stumped heavily for Republican presidential candidate Bob
Dole, the nonpartisan TV preacher was in classic form.
</P>
<P>
   He blasted the ``unremitting assault by the ACLU, the National
Organization for Women and other radical groups'' on family values,
and said that ``this left-wing, radical-extremist coalition has
battered down the laws to preserve family unity.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither he nor the Christian Coalition would rest, he said,
until ``the rotting carcass of the Lyndon Johnson Great Society
programs'' is ``buried once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny stuff, eh?

   Commentary

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ No names here.
</P>
<P>
   These two guys have troubles enough without me identifying them.
That probably would make their lives even tougher. But their
stories have relevance as the New York Legislature grapples with
the question of whether to limit parole in the Empire State. After
the death of a young woman in downtown Albany and the separate
killings of two New York City police officers _ all, authorities
say, at the hands of parolees _ this is a bipartisan effort to keep
violent people off the street longer, as many other states do.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a first-time violent felon is currently eligible
for parole after serving a third of his sentence. He must be
granted parole after serving two-thirds. One legislative proposal _
and it's probably close to what will become law _ would require
inmates to serve 6/7th of their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul _ that's what we'll call him _ thinks this is overly
harsh. He's a solid, middle-class guy who lives in the Albany area.
He has a kid who did something immensely stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Some guys were smashing up his son's car. Rather than call the
cops, Paul's son squeezed off a couple of shots, just to scare
them. He wound up charged with attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   The kid pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment. He got 2 1/3 to
7 years. He just came up for parole and was turned down. He'll do
two more years, at least.
</P>
<P>
   This kid never did anything wrong before, Paul says. While
waiting to go away, he went to college. In the slammer, he has been
taking college courses and keeping his nose clean. If he were
released on parole, he probably would be fine.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed legislation, however, he would be in the can
for a long time. Paul sees no sense in that.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Dave. He's 41 and from the Bronx. He has been in
and out of prison since age 19. He has three robbery convictions.
Only the first one is legit, he told me. The other two were cases
of mistaken identity.
</P>
<P>
   During his last stint in prison, Dave met a woman from the
Albany metro area and married her. When he was paroled, he moved in
with her. It didn't work out, so now he's on his own in a strange
area. His white parole officer picks on him, Dave says. The guy
insists that Dave is involved in some criminal activity, which Dave
denies. But, he says, the parole officer abuses him with racial
insults, imposes silly rules on him and constantly threatens to
send him back to prison.
</P>
<P>
   The guy bursts into his apartment and tosses it regularly. He
also has the local cops hassle Dave. People are afraid to become
his friends, Dave says. He feels isolated and put upon. He has some
emotional problems and is seeing a shrink. If this keeps up, Dave
says, he'll get so upset that he'll lose hope and commit some
horrible crime, just to get even with society.
</P>
<P>
   I mention these stories so you might have some idea of what kind
of people you find in prison in New York. Sometimes they're kids
like Paul's son, who got hot and did something incredibly
boneheaded without considering the consequences. Or they're guys
like Dave, who've spent a lifetime screwing up and who're unable to
recognize any authority higher than their own desires.
</P>
<P>
   If parole is tightened up, people like Dave will stay in the
slammer for almost their entire terms. And New York will be a safer
place. But people like Paul's son will stay in longer, too.
</P>
<P>
   So there's no perfect solution here.
</P>
<P>
   You simply opt for the one with the smaller warts.

   BEIJING _ If you know China, don't bother reading this. You are
already convinced that from megalopolis to mist-shrouded
mountaintop, China is an engaging place.
</P>
<P>
   This is written for the couple of hundred million other
Americans who may love to knock about in bizarre places but haven't
yet made it to the Middle Kingdom. You'll find that China offers
spectacular travel _ riveting vistas, exotic cultures embracing
thousands of years and enticing food on almost every corner of
every city.
</P>
<P>
   If the news coverage surrounding President Clinton's trip to
China June 25-July 3 intrigues you _ whether it's an aged peasant's
creased smile or the serenity of a Guilin lagoon that sinks the
hook in your wanderlust _ make a plan and go for it.
</P>
<P>
   In the three months we've been living and working in China,
we've managed a sampling of some not-to-miss places. China is more
tourist-friendly than ever.
</P>
<P>
   But you should also recognize that this still isn't a country
for the haphazard traveler _ except one who is very experienced,
very patient, or well-versed in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The tourist infrastructure is still building, which means the
Chinese working the taxis, trains and hotels often aren't equipped
to meet the needs of the traveler without a group or a guide.
</P>
<P>
   You will be hard-pressed to find an English speaker even at a
place as cosmopolitan as the Beijing train station. (Our lessons in
Mandarin proved critical the first night we arrived in Beijing. Our
train was two hours late, and the travel agent who was supposed to
meet us at the train station had deserted, leaving us to track down
luggage in an unmarked back room, then negotiate a little-used
customs office and find a midnight taxi at a remote corner of the
station.)
</P>
<P>
   And few cities outside Beijing and Shanghai bother to
transliterate street signs into pinyin, the Latin equivalent of
Chinese characters that enables westerners to follow a map.
</P>
<P>
   That said, even the most inexperienced tourist can select from
the huge palette of sites available in China and create a wonderful
vacation. It requires some groundwork, but then so does most
foreign travel.
</P>
<P>
   In our wanderings here, we've come up with a few tips that may
help.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most relaxing aspects of touring China _ and one of
the most essential _ is reading the guidebooks. Compared to the
travel books on many parts of the world, those about China are
excellent.
</P>
<P>
   These are good reads even if you're not planning a trip, but
just interested in the world's most populous nation with one of the
world's oldest cultures.
</P>
<P>
   We have four recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   -- The newly updated ``Fodor's China'' may be the best
all-around book for an American tourist, giving evocative history
and cultural notes along with hotel and restaurant listings that
you can count on to meet U.S. comfort standards.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Lonely Planet'' includes lower-budget listings and
information that may appeal more to the younger traveler.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Rough Guide'' presents a breezier British style, and in
addition to the typical sites and accommodations, it covers places
slightly off the well-trod western tourist track. It also has a
good section on Chinese phrases.
</P>
<P>
   -- The ``Blue Guide'' is useful for its typically exhaustive
descriptions of every tourist site.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever book you choose, you can believe their descriptions
that defy the stories travelers brought home just 10 or 15 years
ago about austere Chinese hotels and lousy restaurants. That isn't
true today.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a package tour or travelling independently may be a
harder decision in China than elsewhere. You will almost certainly
run into glitches if you go it alone. The question is how easily
you can adjust to complications.
</P>
<P>
   Your American travel agent can make bookings if you opt out of a
group trip, but normally cannot hand over to you in advance the
tickets for internal China transportation. Foreign travel agencies
must rely on the government's China International Travel Services
(CITS), which tries hard but may fall a dab short of success.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before flight time, we have been handed tickets with the
wrong return flight. We've also encountered other travelers who
either got incorrect tickets or were missing tickets when CITS
delivered them to the hotel. One obstacle is that CITS insists on
parcelling out tickets as you travel through your itinerary, rather
than issue a full set when you arrive. That leaves scant time for
fixing errors.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is arranging transportation as you go along.
It sounds daunting, but is remarkably easy. Travel agencies have
offices in most major hotels and can write air and train tickets on
the spot, though making such late reservations carries a small
chance of your chosen flight being fully booked. One pitfall: you
will probably find the departure city and the destination written
in Chinese characters. To get around this, ask the travel agent to
give you a computer printout of the itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need a guide to walk you through major airports, since
signs and announcements are in both Chinese and English. Flight
attendants also use both languages, but communication much beyond
``coffee'' or ``beer'' might strain the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Air travel is a confidence-building experience. Many airlines
use Boeing jets on internal routes, and all follow international
standards _ no goats on board or passengers sitting on suitcases in
the aisles, as happens in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration is whether you can handle a flight that
gets diverted. We ran into a Canadian couple who related the
harrowing experience of making an unscheduled landing at a small
regional airport near Chongqing due to weather. No one spoke
English, and local Chinese verged on a brawl because even they
could get no information for hours on when flights might resume.
</P>
<P>
   But these chance complications are minimal and normally can be
overcome with patience. Many travelers _ us among them _ much
prefer such risks to the homogenization of group travel. We would
rather spend time harassing a CITS agent than waiting for 200
people to get on and off the buses. Travelers choose their own
trade-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Especially if you're travelling outside a tour group, you may
well find it worth the cost to stay at an internationally
recognized hotel. The guidebooks list plenty, and your travel agent
can add hundreds more now that good hotels are proliferating across
China. Outside Beijing and Shanghai, a nice room costs about $120 a
night.
</P>
<P>
   One easy pick is the Holiday Inn, which is not the priciest and
offers fully two dozen hotels in China. These are true havens when
you come back exhausted from crowded, dusty streets, having seen
one fried chicken foot too many, and find yourself longing for a
chef's salad in front of an in-house movie in English. Yet the Inns
carry a local flavor, including their Chinese restaurants that are
as savory as those on the street and have more reliable sanitation
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Holiday Inn is so attuned to western needs that it is the
only hotel we've seen with conspicuous signs in every room warning
not to drink the tap water. Our advice: never drink tap water
anywhere, unless your hotel tells you water has been safely
purified in its own plant.
</P>
<P>
   A western hotel also can help arrange a city or museum tour,
whether they have such excursions scheduled or must ring an agent
to find you a personal guide. For the latter you may have to pout a
bit, but there usually is an English-speaking concierge who can be
convinced to help.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage is that staff are always willing to assist you
getting around their city. They gladly give directions. More
importantly, they will write in Chinese the address you are
seeking, so you can simply hand the paper to the taxi driver _ who
likely won't speak English _ or to a passer-by if you're lost on
foot.
</P>
<P>
   As for restaurants, 100 flowers are blooming. They're
everywhere. And we have yet to stumble across a truly bad one. Ten
years ago, tourists complained that they had to stop in Hong Kong
or San Francisco to eat good Chinese food. Not so today.
</P>
<P>
   You do, however, want to take care in ordering. Chinese cuisine
in China isn't necessarily the same as what appears on the table in
Austin, West Palm Beach, or Atlanta. (EDITORS: YOU MIGHT SUBSTITUTE
THE NAME OF YOUR CITY.) At one of our favorite places in Beijing,
the waitress jokes about bringing us snake _ and she wouldn't have
to go far because they're sitting in the window tank next to the
eels.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you read Chinese, you ought to ask if a restaurant has an
English-language menu before you sit down to dine. What you want is
a ``ying-wen de cai dan'' (pronounced ``ying wen de tsai dan'').
Otherwise you may end up with pig ears or the ubiquitous chicken
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood restaurants are usually much better, as well as
much cheaper than most hotel eateries with dumbed-down cuisines. We
usually dine out for less than $10 for two of us.
</P>
<P>
   One other tip on water: most Chinese will use a kleenex to wipe
off the little plates, rice bowls, glasses and even chopsticks set
out on restaurant tables, to sop up any rogue drops of tap water
left from washing. We do, too.
</P>
<P>
   We also try to bring along an extra paper napkin or tissue,
since the only napkins supplied at most restaurants are single-ply
paper sheets measuring about four inches square.
</P>
<P>
   We also strongly advise that you consider at least one leg of
travel by boat or train. Either will give you a close-up view of
the countryside where two-thirds of China's 1.2 billion people
live.
</P>
<P>
   Chugging through rice paddies by rail you sense the solidity and
longevity of China, watching scenes impossible to imagine from the
cityscapes of Beijing or Shanghai or Xian. Straw-hatted peasants
squat in water-logged fields or urge a water buffalo to lumber
home. How different could it have looked 1,000 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   The best tourist cruise is down the Yangtze River, passing the
mystical sheer cliffs of the Three Gorges and the terraced farm
lands that generations of Chinese painstakingly built up the
mountainsides. A new dam will alter the character of this famous
landscape after the year 2003, raising the river the height of a
60-story building. The beauty will not be fully erased, but the
drama will be gone. Go soon.

<P>
   BEIJING _ If you know China, don't bother reading this. You are
already convinced that from megalopolis to mist-shrouded
mountaintop, China is an engaging place.
</P>
<P>
   This is written for the couple of hundred million other
Americans who may love to knock about in bizarre places but haven't
yet made it to the Middle Kingdom. You'll find that China offers
spectacular travel _ riveting vistas, exotic cultures embracing
thousands of years and enticing food on almost every corner of
every city.
</P>
<P>
   If the news coverage surrounding President Clinton's trip to
China June 25-July 3 intrigues you _ whether it's an aged peasant's
creased smile or the serenity of a Guilin lagoon that sinks the
hook in your wanderlust _ make a plan and go for it.
</P>
<P>
   In the three months we've been living and working in China,
we've managed a sampling of some not-to-miss places. China is more
tourist-friendly than ever.
</P>
<P>
   But you should also recognize that this still isn't a country
for the haphazard traveler _ except one who is very experienced,
very patient, or well-versed in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The tourist infrastructure is still building, which means the
Chinese working the taxis, trains and hotels often aren't equipped
to meet the needs of the traveler without a group or a guide.
</P>
<P>
   You will be hard-pressed to find an English speaker even at a
place as cosmopolitan as the Beijing train station. (Our lessons in
Mandarin proved critical the first night we arrived in Beijing. Our
train was two hours late, and the travel agent who was supposed to
meet us at the train station had deserted, leaving us to track down
luggage in an unmarked back room, then negotiate a little-used
customs office and find a midnight taxi at a remote corner of the
station.)
</P>
<P>
   And few cities outside Beijing and Shanghai bother to
transliterate street signs into pinyin, the Latin equivalent of
Chinese characters that enables westerners to follow a map.
</P>
<P>
   That said, even the most inexperienced tourist can select from
the huge palette of sites available in China and create a wonderful
vacation. It requires some groundwork, but then so does most
foreign travel.
</P>
<P>
   In our wanderings here, we've come up with a few tips that may
help.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most relaxing aspects of touring China _ and one of
the most essential _ is reading the guidebooks. Compared to the
travel books on many parts of the world, those about China are
excellent.
</P>
<P>
   These are good reads even if you're not planning a trip, but
just interested in the world's most populous nation with one of the
world's oldest cultures.
</P>
<P>
   We have four recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   -- The newly updated ``Fodor's China'' may be the best
all-around book for an American tourist, giving evocative history
and cultural notes along with hotel and restaurant listings that
you can count on to meet U.S. comfort standards.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Lonely Planet'' includes lower-budget listings and
information that may appeal more to the younger traveler.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Rough Guide'' presents a breezier British style, and in
addition to the typical sites and accommodations, it covers places
slightly off the well-trod western tourist track. It also has a
good section on Chinese phrases.
</P>
<P>
   -- The ``Blue Guide'' is useful for its typically exhaustive
descriptions of every tourist site.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever book you choose, you can believe their descriptions
that defy the stories travelers brought home just 10 or 15 years
ago about austere Chinese hotels and lousy restaurants. That isn't
true today.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a package tour or travelling independently may be a
harder decision in China than elsewhere. You will almost certainly
run into glitches if you go it alone. The question is how easily
you can adjust to complications.
</P>
<P>
   Your American travel agent can make bookings if you opt out of a
group trip, but normally cannot hand over to you in advance the
tickets for internal China transportation. Foreign travel agencies
must rely on the government's China International Travel Services
(CITS), which tries hard but may fall a dab short of success.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before flight time, we have been handed tickets with the
wrong return flight. We've also encountered other travelers who
either got incorrect tickets or were missing tickets when CITS
delivered them to the hotel. One obstacle is that CITS insists on
parcelling out tickets as you travel through your itinerary, rather
than issue a full set when you arrive. That leaves scant time for
fixing errors.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is arranging transportation as you go along.
It sounds daunting, but is remarkably easy. Travel agencies have
offices in most major hotels and can write air and train tickets on
the spot, though making such late reservations carries a small
chance of your chosen flight being fully booked. One pitfall: you
will probably find the departure city and the destination written
in Chinese characters. To get around this, ask the travel agent to
give you a computer printout of the itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need a guide to walk you through major airports, since
signs and announcements are in both Chinese and English. Flight
attendants also use both languages, but communication much beyond
``coffee'' or ``beer'' might strain the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Air travel is a confidence-building experience. Many airlines
use Boeing jets on internal routes, and all follow international
standards _ no goats on board or passengers sitting on suitcases in
the aisles, as happens in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration is whether you can handle a flight that
gets diverted. We ran into a Canadian couple who related the
harrowing experience of making an unscheduled landing at a small
regional airport near Chongqing due to weather. No one spoke
English, and local Chinese verged on a brawl because even they
could get no information for hours on when flights might resume.
</P>
<P>
   But these chance complications are minimal and normally can be
overcome with patience. Many travelers _ us among them _ much
prefer such risks to the homogenization of group travel. We would
rather spend time harassing a CITS agent than waiting for 200
people to get on and off the buses. Travelers choose their own
trade-offs.

HOW TO OVERHAUL THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ When the House of Representatives takes up
campaign finance reform in the coming weeks, we will have our best
chance in decades to enact real reform.
</P>
<P>
   Through the bipartisan efforts of many individual members of
Congress, especially my 11 Republican colleagues whom I joined in
signing the discharge petition requiring consideration of several
campaign finance bills, the Republican leadership last month
promised that reforms will be fully and openly debated.
</P>
<P>
   This was a major victory for all supporters, both Democrat and
Republican, of serious campaign reform.
</P>
<P>
   The bill we'll start with will be the bipartisan initiative
commonly referred to as the ``Freshman Bill,'' authored by two
first-term congressmen, Reps. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., and Thomas H.
Allen, D-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Their proposed legislation is a good bill from which to build.
It would ban soft money, the unlimited amounts of money that now
can be given to political parties but spent by them to support
candidates. It's in this area that the greatest abuses have been
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Transfers of soft money between the states also would be
prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Contribution limits to federal parties and candidates would be
indexed for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   And there would be greater disclosure of contributions from
outside groups.
</P>
<P>
   This bill, however, is only a start to comprehensive reform. I
will be offering an amendment that is similar to a bill I
introduced while I served in the California state senate.
</P>
<P>
   It is simple in concept. It would offer the truest type of
reform: If a person can't vote, that person can't contribute. But
if a potential donor is eligible to vote in the state where a
candidate is running for the U.S. Senate, or in a district where a
candidate is running for the House, that individual could give the
candidate up to $1,000. All other donors would be limited to gifts
of $100 or less.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, all political action committees would be banned
from giving money to federal candidates. No PACs, no companies, no
labor unions. Just people to whom that elected official is
responsible at the ballot box. Only they could give money.
</P>
<P>
   Also included would be a ban on unions spending portions of dues
for political purposes without prior written consent from members,
a federal version of the Proposition 226 that California voters
rejected on June 2. But the same kind of limits would extend to
corporations, restricting political gifts in proportion to the
percent of shareholders who don't object.
</P>
<P>
   This would dramatically change the landscape of our political
campaigns by returning the real power for choosing our
representatives to the people who actually elect them. Imagine a
candidate having to raise most of the campaign money from
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine not having any special interest groups unduly
influencing our congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   In this Congress and the last, I've worked many hours on a
bipartisan basis with my colleagues for the consideration and
support of campaign finance reform in a full and open manner. This
resulted from the persistent efforts of individuals willing to go
on the line and take the criticism for it. And also because of the
responsiveness of the House leadership, which has been willing to
listen and accommodate the concerns of the membership.
</P>
<P>
   I hope Congress will seize this historic opportunity to reform a
campaign process whose abuses are daily becoming more and more
apparent.

   BEIJING _ This is the city central to your China trip.
</P>
<P>
   From the chaotic alleys called hutongs to the grace of the
Forbidden City built for the emperor and his entourage, China's
capital can keep you happily occupied for five days. After that, it
gets to be work.
</P>
<P>
   An aimless stroll or float across the lake in Beihai Park will
put you in the company of Chinese relaxing away an afternoon. Or
try hunting down the Niujie Mosque, where tranquil gardens date
back to the 15th Century, and the nearby Fayuansi Buddhist temple
to see an ancient spiritual dimension of modern Chinese life.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some recommendations specific to Beijing touring:
</P>
<P>
   Take care if attracted by the colorful, fun-looking pedi-cabs
whose drivers will drive you crazy with their constant pitch to
ride. They're safe enough, but at the end of the trip the peddlers
will find some reason to charge you more than the promised price.
It's unpleasant and worth avoiding.
</P>
<P>
   You will want a day trip to climb the Great Wall and can choose
one of three places to do it. Pass up Badaling if possible.
</P>
<P>
   Mutianyu is a site half an hour further from the center of
Beijing, but is much less crowded and more majestic. Even further
from downtown is Simatai, which we find most impressive. Both
Mutianyu and Simatai run cable cars up the steep ridges to the
wall, but Simatai still requires a taxing half-hour climb up stone
stairs from the top of the cable. The wall itself has not been
repaired for the last couple of centuries, so walking the entire
open section is real exercise and not recommended on a wet day. Yet
the isolation of the place, small numbers of tourists, and
unspoiled mountain vistas are magnificent. Plus, the ride out gives
an intriguing glimpse of village and farm life.
</P>
<P>
   Our most important advice is to get a hotel as close to the
center as possible, which means the environs of the Forbidden City
and Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of luxury hotels string out toward the airport in the
northeast, but they are best reserved for business travelers whose
duties take them to the new high-rise office buildings also located
there. Most are a 40-minute to one-hour drive from the center, and
offer little to visit unless the Hard Rock Cafe is your top
priority.
</P>
<P>
   The Peace Hotel and Palace Hotel are in the lively Wangfujing
shopping district about a 15- to 20-minute walk from the entry of
the Forbidden City. The Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza (the chain's only
hotel in the center) is in the same area, and all three are well
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   However, our favorite is the place we're living, the Beijing
Hotel. Although a Chinese government hotel, it used to be the only
place foreigners could stay. It isn't a five-star luxury hotel, but
has nearly all the amenities you could need. It is surrounded by
shops and restaurants and is within two blocks of Tiananmen Square.
The hotel's gift shops are reasonable and have a huge selection,
should you chose not to spend hours digging through Beijing's
eclectic markets.
</P>
<P>
   Its selection of foreign-language television is limited mostly
to CNN, but the view from your balcony will be much more beguiling
than any television program. When making a reservation, have your
travel agent request a room on a high floor ending in the numbers
36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 43 or 44, which all face the western hills.
</P>
<P>
   From these rooms, you will directly overlook the red and yellow
pitched roofs of the Forbidden City, and with binoculars can see
details of the morning flag-raising on Tiananmen Square. The scene
is unmatched.

back to the 15th Century, and the nearby Fayuansi Buddhist temple
to see an ancient spiritual dimension of modern Chinese life.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some recommendations specific to Beijing touring:
</P>
<P>
   Take care if attracted by the colorful, fun-looking pedi-cabs
whose drivers will drive you crazy with their constant pitch to
ride. They're safe enough, but at the end of the trip the peddlers
will find some reason to charge you more than the promised price.
It's unpleasant and worth avoiding.
</P>
<P>
   You will want a day trip to climb the Great Wall and can choose
one of three places to do it. Pass up Badaling if possible.
</P>
<P>
   Mutianyu is a site half an hour further from the center of
Beijing, but is much less crowded and more majestic. Even further
from downtown is Simatai, which we find most impressive. Both
Mutianyu and Simatai run cable cars up the steep ridges to the
wall, but Simatai still requires a taxing half-hour climb up stone
stairs from the top of the cable. The wall itself has not been
repaired for the last couple of centuries, so walking the entire
open section is real exercise and not recommended on a wet day. Yet
the isolation of the place, small numbers of tourists, and
unspoiled mountain vistas are magnificent. Plus, the ride out gives
an intriguing glimpse of village and farm life.
</P>
<P>
   Our most important advice is to get a hotel as close to the
center as possible, which means the environs of the Forbidden City
and Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of luxury hotels string out toward the airport in the
northeast, but they are best reserved for business travelers whose
duties take them to the new high-rise office buildings also located
there. Most are a 40-minute to one-hour drive from the center, and
offer little to visit unless the Hard Rock Cafe is your top
priority.
</P>
<P>
   The Peace Hotel and Palace Hotel are in the lively Wangfujing
shopping district about a 15- to 20-minute walk from the entry of
the Forbidden City. The Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza (the chain's only
hotel in the center) is in the same area, and all three are well
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   However, our favorite is the place we're living, the Beijing
Hotel. Although a Chinese government hotel, it used to be the only
place foreigners could stay. It isn't a five-star luxury hotel, but
has nearly all the amenities you could need. It is surrounded by
shops and restaurants and is within two blocks of Tiananmen Square.
The hotel's gift shops are reasonable and have a huge selection,
should you chose not to spend hours digging through Beijing's
eclectic markets.
</P>
<P>
   Its selection of foreign-language television is limited mostly
to CNN, but the view from your balcony will be much more beguiling
than any television program. When making a reservation, have your
travel agent request a room on a high floor ending in the numbers
36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 43 or 44, which all face the western hills.
</P>
<P>
   From these rooms, you will directly overlook the red and yellow
pitched roofs of the Forbidden City, and with binoculars can see
details of the morning flag-raising on Tiananmen Square. The scene
is unmatched.

GETTING IN TOUCH WITH NATURE AMID GIANT REDWOODS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The easiest way I know to transform your weekend
into a life of leisure, freedom and play is to head into the Santa
Cruz Mountains and spend Friday and Saturday nights in a tent cabin
at Big Basin Redwoods State Park.
</P>
<P>
   Covering a vast swathe of redwoods and wildlands, about 10,000
acres in all, Big Basin is one of the best parks anywhere. I keep
returning for the hikes and natural beauty. It has a network of 80
miles of trails, waterfalls, an ocean view from a little-known
lookout and an easy loop walk amid giant redwoods 1,500 to 2,000
years old. There is also some challenging but fantastic mountain
biking available on some back-country fire roads.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 miles from Santa Cruz, the park is close enough to
reach easily in a morning drive from anywhere in the San Francisco
Bay area but remote enough to feel as if you have left the masses
far away. I've visited dozens of times and will keep coming back
for more.
</P>
<P>
   The tent cabins are well removed from the park's developed
campgrounds. Big Basin has 138 drive-in sites, 38 walk-in sites and
35 tent cabins, but the cabins are located off Huckleberry Camp
Loop Road, about two miles from headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   As you drive up, you will immediately see the appeal. Tent
cabins allow you to go camping without having to deal with any of
the sometimes troublesome stuff like setting up a tent and trying
to sleep comfortably or staying clean, dry and warm.
</P>
<P>
   Made of wood and canvas, these tent cabins measure 12 by 14 feet
and come with two full-size beds, a table and a wood stove. You
should take sleeping bags, a lantern, cooking gear, food, cooler
and firewood although lanterns are available for rent and small
bundles of firewood available for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The cost is $40 a night. Reservations are required. As of July
1, summer rates will go into effect for July and August: $42 per
night Sunday through Thursday, two-night minimum; and $44 per night
Friday and Saturday. Holiday weekends will require a three-night
minimum at $49 per night.
</P>
<P>
   When I made my reservation, I was assigned Tent Cabin No. 30.
What a perfect choice: It just so happened that a surprise rain
shower ripped through the area that night, pounding so hard that it
sounded as if someone were standing on the roof with a machine gun.
If I had hiked to a trail camp, everything would have been soaked.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I woke up the next morning a bit bleary-eyed but dry,
warm and ready for adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Right out from camp, there is an easy loop trail to Sempervirens
Falls, a chute-like, narrow stream of flowing silver. The hiking
and biking here are stellar.
</P>
<P>
   Big Basin's most famous trail is the Skyline-to-Sea Trail
leading to 70-foot Berry Creek Falls, one of the prettiest natural
settings in Northern California. From the trailhead at park
headquarters, it's a 4.7-mile, one-way hike. You can add another
mile by heading up the canyon to see Silver Falls, a beautiful free
fall, and Golden Falls, which looks like a giant golden water
slide.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not as famous, a favorite of mine is the Meteor
Trail, a 5.2-mile round trip to a lookout over the Waddell Creek
canyon and beyond to the Pacific Coast. The route starts by running
upstream along pretty Opal Creek on the Skyline-to-Sea Trail for
two miles, then cuts off on the Meteor Trail and climbs 400 feet to
the Middle Ridge Fire Road. From here, you walk about 200 yards to
the lookout, set at an elevation of 1,600 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The park's back country provides access to a network of fire
roads that are perfect for ambitious mountain bikers who are in
great physical condition. The best is China Grade, which ranges for
miles into the back country in a half loop from Highway 236. It has
some potholes from the heavy rains, but it's passable. Be certain
to have plenty of drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   The park suffered vast trail damage from storm washouts, but
most of it has been repaired. There are still a few bridge washouts
along streams, but most visitors are not deterred. They have been
wading across, finding a downed tree to use as a natural bridge or
just hopping across shallow spots.
</P>
<P>
   After all, what trouble is a little stream-hopping when you know
you have a warm, dry tent cabin waiting for you?
</P>

will change to 831 on July 11.)

THOUSANDS FLEE RUSSIA'S BRUTAL MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; MOSCOW _ Every few days, the powerfully built men in Russian
military uniforms pound on the door to the central Moscow
apartment, frightening the neighbors and threatening the occupants
with fines, imprisonment, and worse if they do not give up their
son, 23-year-old Alex.
</P>
<P>
   The men always go away angry, empty-handed, and vowing to
return. For Alex is on the run from the law. His crime is that he
does not want to do his compulsory service in Russia's armed
forces, where brutality and maltreatment of draftees is the only
reality.
</P>
<P>
   For the five years since he turned 18 and his number came up,
Alex's life has been driven, as he puts it, by ``pure, animal
fear.'' He frequently changes jobs and apartments, avoids
encounters with authorities and trips to the doctor. Most of all,
he stays away from his parents' home and those soldiers who keep
trying to break down the steel door.
</P>
<P>
   Vitaly, 19, has not been so lucky. He was walking to the street
market where he makes his living as a vendor when two military men
accosted him and dragged him to his local draft board. The law says
soldiers have no right to arrest people in Russia, but during draft
season, no one cares much about the law.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man would provide his last name.
</P>
<P>
   June is the month when the thoughts of tens of thousands of
Russian young men like Alex and Vitaly turn to life on the lam in a
desperate attempt to avoid service in the country's harsh, hungry,
and underfunded military. They are pursued by modern-day press
gangs of burly soldiers and military recruitment officers, no less
desperate to meet enlistment quotas and fill the ranks of the
world's second-largest armed forces, after China, by the spring
draft deadline at the end of the month. These people have been
known to beat, imprison, even plant drugs on their quarry _
anything to get their man.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Defense Ministry estimates that 30,000 men skipped the
draft last year, and the number is expected to be higher in 1998.
They do not run from fear of another Chechnya, the ugly 20-month
civil war that claimed the lives of 80,000, according to unofficial
estimates, many of them Russian servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   What turns so many men into fugitives is a different statistic,
this one official: On only three days last year, when the country
was not at war, a Russian soldier did not die. Of more than 1,700
victims, 500 are believed to have been suicides. Non-military
observers say they believe the real figures are much higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people are not afraid that they will have to shoot
another person, but that they will kill you in training or in the
barracks,'' said Alex. ``I personally wouldn't serve in any army,
but for most others, the main thing is fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The specter of the war with Chechnya is seared into the life of
the ordinary Russian grunt, even now, nearly two years after the
fighting stopped. The humiliating Russian defeat, which many
Russian and Western analysts attributed in part to the low morale
and poor training of the Russian forces, has spawned a name for the
hazing and harassment of new recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they hit you in the face, they tell you `Chechnya.' If some
idiot shoots at you with a machine gun, it's `Chechnya,''' said
Muscovite Alexander Gorokhov, who recently finished a two-year
hitch serving near Vladivostok.
</P>
<P>
   Hazing exists in any army. But in Russia, hazing is particularly
brutal.
</P>
<P>
   How bad is it? When the military opened a hazing hot line this
year to allow soldiers the chance to drop the dime on their
tormentors, they received 2,000 calls in the first month.
 &UR;  &LR; Shootings among soldiers, like an incident in May in which four
servicemen killed their commanding officer, have become so
commonplace that they are no longer front page news.
</P>
<P>
   Yury Dyomin, Russia's top military prosecutor, has vowed to
crack down on hazing. But his efforts have had little visible
effect so far. The Defense Ministry says that 20,000 Russian
soldiers have deserted their posts in the past four years. Despite
an amnesty program set up by Dyomin that allows deserters to
explain why they bolted, few want to risk the mandatory five-year
prison sentence if the army does not accept their explanations.
</P>
<P>
   Valentina Melnikova, of the Committee of Soliders' Mothers, a
non-government watchdog on military affairs, puts the number of
deserters at at least twice the official total. In most cases, she
says, deserters cite beatings, hunger, forced imprisonment, and
other mistreatment as the reason for leaving their units.
</P>
<P>
   Some military analysts say they believe a smaller, well-paid
professional army would have higher morale and better leadership,
and therefore less hazing, than Russia's huge, chronically
underfunded conscript army of 1.5 million servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, during an election campaign and at the height of the
Chechen war, President Boris N. Yeltsin promised to cancel the
draft and move to a professional armed forces of 500,000 men by
2000.
</P>
<P>
   This promise may have helped Yeltsin win reelection. But this
year, his defense minister, Igor Sergeyev, has said a transition to
a professional army would take as much as five years longer. If
Yeltsin honors his word and does not run for a third term in 2000,
some of the favorites to replace him do not support his plans for
military reform. One potential front-runner, Moscow Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov, has denounced the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the army, which in Soviet days was seen as a ``school
of life,'' and an integral part of becoming a man, is now loathed
as a hellish prison to avoid at all costs. One recent opinion poll
showed that 82 percent of young people do not want to serve in
Russia's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   As in most countries, the rich and resourceful in Russia have
ways to avoid military service. They can pay bribes of up to $5,000
to recruitment officers, or pay slightly less for doctors to
``find'' an illness that disqualifies them from service. Some men
enter into fictitious marriages with women who have infants to
exploit a two-year delay for new fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Alex chose to run because he could not pay the bribes. The irony
of his situation is that he has declared himself a conscientious
objector to military service, which, under Russia's 1993
constitution, should grant him the right to alternative civilian
service.
</P>
<P>
   But the law detailing how such alternative service should work
has been bogged down in Parliament for four years, and the powerful
military lobby of the lower house of Parliament, the State Duma, is
dead set against passing it any time soon. As a result, recruitment
officers ignore the constitutional right.
</P>
<P>
   So have the courts. In one highly publicized case here this
spring, a Moscow judge ruled that Alexander Borodin, a 23-year-old
conscientious objector, was guilty of dodging the draft. Borodin
was ordered to pay a fine of $2,840 by the judge, who also ordered
him to report and serve. The case was a warning to young men like
Alex, who believe that their best bet is to remain in hiding.
Thousands of others not do not even know they have a right not to
serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The draft board doesn't tell them and the papers don't write
about it, and the people don't know the Constitution,'' said
Nikolai Khramov of Russia's Antimilitaristic Radical Association,
which opposes the draft and advises young men to declare themselves
conscientious objectors.
</P>
<P>
   Khramov tells draft-age, able-bodied men to obey the law by
appearing at their draft boards, but then to demand alternative
civilian service. A complicated appeal process ensues, and the army
usually threatens criminal proceedings. But in most cases when the
would-be draftee follows the letter of the law, and exposes the
contradictions in it, he wins, Khramov says.
</P>
<P>
   Khramov's efforts have come under attack from the military
lobby, which says he is teaching people to break the law. Melnikova
of Soldiers' Mothers, which also advises young men how to legally
avoid the draft, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that you don't support that kind of military service
is also a kind of social action,'' Melnikova said. ``If the state
doesn't want to change the way its military is run, maybe if we get
enough people involved, we can make them do it.''

SOUTHERN BAPTISTS TRUMPET A VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In each of the past three years, the Southern Baptists' annual
convention has been marked by a defining declaration of the march
rightward of the nation's largest Protestant denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the convention made international headlines by voting
to boycott the Walt Disney Co., an icon of American culture, after
accusing the entertainment giant of promoting homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Baptists raised a furor and drew charges of
anti-Semitism when they appointed a missionary specifically to
evangelize Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the convention sent shock waves across the country
when it voted to amend its essential statement of beliefs to
include a proclamation that a woman should ``submit herself
graciously'' to her husband's leadership and that a husband should
``provide for, protect and lead his family.''
</P>
<P>
   The declaration is the culmination of the takeover of the
Southern Baptist Convention by fundamentalists who believe the
Bible must be taken literally as the inerrant word of God. Starting
nearly 20 years ago, they have pushed moderates out of the
denomination's six seminaries and its administrative bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Using Scripture as leverage, they have turned the denomination
into a political powerhouse, supplying foot soldiers for the
religious right on issues ranging from abortion to prayer in public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers said it was no coincidence that the convention
chose as its keynote speaker James Dobson, a radio and television
evangelist who is becoming an influential voice in the Republican
Party. ``Churches must teach citizenship,'' he told the Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   Adding hundreds of churches to its rolls every year, the
Southern Baptist Convention is a force to be reckoned with. Founded
more than 150 years ago when Baptists split over slavery, Southern
Baptists are by far the largest of the nation's Baptist faiths.
</P>
<P>
   There also are historically black Baptist denominations. In this
area, many people associate Baptists with the American Baptist
Churches, a liberal mainline Protestant denomination with 1.5
million members.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, Southern Baptists have established more than 200
congregations, most in Massachusetts, and have plans to open more
in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anybody who wants to believe the Bible is true and are
serious about wanting to reach the world with the word of Jesus
Christ will be increasingly comfortable with the Southern Baptist
Convention,'' Paige Patterson, the convention's new president and
an architect of the fundamentalist takeover, told reporters at this
year's meeting in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say Southern Baptist leaders mix politics with
religion, trying to pass off their conservative political ideology
as Christian theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have essentially said that you're either pro-family or
pro-feminism, pro-Bible or pro-culture, pro-God or pro-Democratic
Party,'' said Robert Parham, executive director of the independent
Baptist Center for Ethics in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were architects of political strategy behind that
statement who will walk away with the message that 16 million
Southern Baptists endorse a platform they want to force onto the
national agenda,'' said the Rev. C. Welton Gaddy, a moderate
Southern Baptist minister and executive director of The Interfaith
Alliance, based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   While the 250-word document on family life spoke of the ``equal
worth'' of a husband and wife, the statement was one of the most
controversial declarations any Christian denomination has made in
recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration has helped position Southern Baptists as among
the most conservative of Protestant evangelicals, a rapidly
expanding group that represents one-fourth of the nation's
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year since 1974, over a million American children have
experienced the pain and trauma of their parents' divorce,'' said
Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Ethics and
Religious Liberty Commission and an author of the declaration. ``We
believed it was time to bear witness to this culture about what God
says about marriage and family.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement leans on biblical passages, particularly those in
Ephesians comparing the relationship between husband and wife to
Jesus's authority over the church. ``Wives, be subject to your
husbands as though to the Lord,'' reads one often-cited verse
(Ephesians 5:22). But today, few Christian churches, including the
Roman Catholic Church, interpret the passage literally.
</P>
<P>
   Biblical scholars also note that the passages have to be
understood in the context of the times. Facing extreme pressure
from the Greco-Roman culture, Christian writers in the second half
of the first century played down earlier notions of equality
between men and women and between master and slave.
</P>
<P>
   ``People pick and choose parts of the Bible that fit their
political ideology,'' said Rita Nakashima Brock, a theologian and
director of the Bunting Institute at Radcliffe College, who charges
that Southern Baptist leaders are trying to justify the
subordination of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're using the same method to talk about the submission of
women that they used to promote slavery in 1845,'' said Bill C.
Leonard, a church historian and dean of the divinity school at Wake
Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C. ``Three years ago they
repented publicly of having used the Bible that way. One has to ask
whether in another century they may be repenting for this.''
</P>
<P>
   While fundamentalist leadership dominates the Southern Baptists,
there still are strong moderate voices. The Texas Southern Baptist
Convention, the largest statewide convention, is run by a moderate
president. And moderate Southern Baptists banded together eight
years ago to form the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, which claims
1,600 churches nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   And because the Southern Baptist Convention has no creed, no
Southern Baptist is required to agree with any Faith and Message
Statement.
</P>
<P>
   Still the article on family is important because it is now a
central theological doctrine and because convention employees will
be expected to obey it.
</P>
<P>
   Many Southern Baptist leaders shrug off critics, boasting that
they are at war with an America they believe has abandoned God and
sunk into sinfulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``America has been engulfed by a tidal wave of moral relativism
and we quite happily confess that we are moral absolutists,'' Land
said. ``Some things are always wrong and some things are always
right. That automatically puts us in direct confrontation with this
culture. So be it. We're not trying to be politically correct, but
biblically correct.''

THE TIMES ARE RIGHT FOR A REJUVENATED PEACE CORPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Wherever American foreign policy is headed, I have
a sneaking suspicion that Dennis Robinson is going to get there
first. If we let him.
</P>
<P>
   Like 6,100 other Americans, Dennis Robinson is in the Peace
Corps. He's just back from Panama, on the front lines of one of
today's most important battles _ against the primal forces behind
slash-and-burn agriculture and the dire threat it poses to public
health, the environment and the world's ability to feed a
still-exploding population.
</P>
<P>
   His work in the countryside has involved showing farmers how to
keep a chunk of land in production, the key to stabilizing rural
life as well as the rural environment.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the Peace Corps lit Dennis Robinson's candle. He
is anything but quixotic as he discusses the pressures on the
people he has served. But he is clearly in awe at how the Peace
Corps took a kid out of a small community in Kentucky, fresh out of
college, and connected him to the world. Like 151,000 other
Americans over the past generation-plus, he is utterly transformed.
</P>
<P>
   You couldn't imagine a better choice for an important new facet
of the program _ the Crisis Corps, which is shipping experienced
volunteers into places that have suffered natural disasters or
where peace has only recently replaced chaos and violence.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a question of will but of money. More outrageously,
it's a question of a small amount of money _ maybe $45 million,
which is chicken feed next to the tens of billions in pure pork
that fattened the highway bill President Clinton signed last week.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, this is very much your father's or your
mother's Peace Corps, its well-tried concept of service chugging
along in 84 countries. But in many others, it's different, more
vital _ the fruit of director Mark Gearan's work since the
president shipped his longtime pal over there in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   It is, for example, very much a part of post-Cold War
reconstruction. From an opening wedge in Eastern Europe, it has
moved into the battered former republics of the former Soviet Union
itself _ in Ukraine, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan. Georgia is next.
</P>
<P>
   The first English teachers went to China five years ago. The
first volunteers went back to Haiti while peacekeepers were still
patrolling there in 1996. And perhaps the luckiest volunteers are
now working with schoolteachers in reborn South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Anything but a dumb pol, Gearan yanked me down the street to eat
sandwiches with a dozen just-returned volunteers, who, like Peace
Corps workers for 37 years, can make the program's case in ways
that Director No. 14 (just like No. 1, R. Sargent Shriver) can't.
</P>
<P>
   The case is easily the biggest no-brainer in Washington. After
roughly 20 flat years the time has come to take the Peace Corps to
a new level. Clinton decided in January to take it from 6,100
volunteers and $220-plus million this year to 10,000 volunteers and
$270 million in the year 2000, still well under the
15,000-volunteer peak in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   At the time there was no dissent, no argument. But within
Congress there has also been no action since. Part of it is the
general congressional dysfunction and part is the specific
dysfunction over the budget. With account juggling there could be
room within the emerging Senate appropriation, but Newt Gingrich's
House right now couldn't decide to fund the tissue in its
restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Going a bit deeper, though, modern conservatism is growing
isolationist appendages; it's much less Reagan and Bush and more
and more Pat Buchanan. It shows in a growing hostility to trade, to
international engagement, to the United Nations, and to the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The president confronts this effectively on occasion, as he did
on China last week, but he needs to do it more and more loudly.
</P>
<P>
   He has experience fighting for his domestic counterpart,
AmeriCorps. This stunning start-up _ with major business and
bipartisan support_ survives Gingrich-inspired troublemakers
because each year the president simply refuses to accept the larger
appropriation bill that includes AmeriCorps until the program is
sufficiently funded.
</P>
<P>
   A little of that spirit would help him and, more important, help
the Peace Corps.
</P>
<P>
   The times are right. Since 1994 the number of inquiries by
potential volunteers has soared by nearly 50 percent, to more than
150,000. The spirit is there in a generation that deserves more
than Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The times are also right in the world. Freedom, independence,
and market economies _ the raw material for a better, stable world
_ are in the ascendancy, and Peace Corp volunteers are democracy's
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   And the times are also right for their modern mission. Education
remains the core, as it should, but what is new is a fresh emphasis
on environmental projects and small-business and community
development.
</P>
<P>
   T.J. Jones is a sharp kid out of Rocky Mount, N.C., an
African-American in the middle of Ukraine. Among its many evils,
communism blocked the normal institutions of community life. T.J.
Jones is up to his ears helping nonprofit, service organizations
put concrete in democracy's foundation.
</P>
<P>
   For his sake, for theirs and for ours, the idea that we are not
literally throwing money at T.J. Jones is absurd.

HOW DOES YOUR FOOT `FALL ASLEEP'? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By USHA LEE MCFARLING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. When your foot ``falls asleep'' because you sat on it too
long, what exactly is happening inside, and what causes that
tingling feeling?
</P>
<P>
   S.B., Boston
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The most common reason for a foot falling asleep is that
blood flow to the nerves has been cut, says Dr. Ira Black,
professor and chair of the Department of Neuroscience and Cell
Biology at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in Piscataway, N.J.
This can happen if you cross your legs for too long or hold your
legs in any position that puts pressure on the arteries that bring
blood from the heart, blocking the flow. The same thing can occur
in your hands if blood flow through your arms is impeded.
</P>
<P>
   All parts of the body, including the nerves, require blood to
function, says Black. Sensory nerves normally send information
about pressure, pain, and temperature from the body to the brain by
sending out electrical impulses in response to particular stimuli.
When the blood supply is limited, though, the nerve begins to act
abnormally.
</P>
<P>
   The tingling sensation you feel actually occurs when the nerve
``wakes up.'' As blood begins to flow back into the region, the
nerve goes back to work. But for a short time, it sends out its
electrical impulses in a disorganized manner, not in response to
the proper stimuli. This is why you might feel pressure, tingling,
or even a burning sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Even though nothing is actually happening to your legs, the
brain is getting signals from the nerves. The different sensations,
such as burning or tingling, come from different nerves that
normally carry different types of sensory information, says Black,
a former president of the Society for Neuroscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``People report a lot of very strange types of information,'' he
says. The same phenomenon can occur around the mouth and jaw after
a trip to the dentist when the Novocain wears off.
</P>
<P>
   Tingling feet are normal _ if they occur after a foot has fallen
asleep. But tingling and other strange sensations that regularly
occur in the limbs for no apparent reason may be a sign of nerve
disease and should be checked by a physician, says Black.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We all know that there are good and bad bacteria that live in
the body. Are there good viruses, too, or are all viruses bad?
</P>
<P>
   J.W.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. From the fungi that cause bread to rise and beer to ferment
to the antibiotic-producing bacteria that fight illness, a host of
natural organisms have turned out to be beneficial to humans. Can
viruses do good as well?
</P>
<P>
   ``One suspects so,'' says virologist Michael B.A. Oldstone, a
professor at The Scripps Research Institute in California and
author of the recent book, ``Viruses, Plagues and History.'' There
may be many viruses that are somehow beneficial to humans out there
_ among the myriad viruses that are still unknown or unstudied.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unlikely that a virus might be beneficial. Most viruses
are parasites _ they require a host cell in order to reproduce and
infect other cells. ``They've evolved to favor their own
persistence,'' says Oldstone. In other words, they don't want to
bite the hand that feeds them, so they aren't always noxious to the
hosts they depend on.
</P>
<P>
   One known case of a virus doing good, at least for Dutch tulip
sellers, comes from the tulip mosaic virus. This virus caused
streaks to appear in tulips, and the colorful result meant the
flowers could be sold at premium prices, says Oldstone.
</P>
<P>
   Many biotechnology firms are also hard at work trying to coax
viruses into creating products that would be medically beneficial,
says Oldstone. The smallpox virus, for instance, promotes the
growth of skin cells, which produces the unsightly pox. While
infection with smallpox can be fatal, scientists are trying to use
non-lethal portions of the virus to encourage skin growth as a
therapy for people with burns.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Other scientists are trying to exploit some of the clever
tricks used by viruses. For example, when a cell is infected by a
virus, that cell then begins to look ``foreign'' to immune cells
that seek out and kill any foreign substance that might harm the
body. Some viruses can mask this signal after they infect a cell so
that the cell they reside in is not attacked. If scientists could
harness this masking technique, or use viruses to perform the same
masking service, they might be better at preventing immune system
rejection of skin grafts or organ transplants.

   NEW RELEASES:  &UR; ``The Wings of the Dove'' &LR;  _ Helena Bonham Carter
stars in this remarkable adaptation of Henry James's novel. She
injects her Jamesian character with blood and fury and sex _
characteristics often lost in other film interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``The Rage'' &LR;  _ Gary Busey, who started so promisingly in films
such as ``Carny'' and ``The Buddy Holly Story,'' hits rock bottom
in this action-oriented melodrama. As an FBI agent, Busey is beyond
the pale, and he's not given much help from the script. One great
car crash does not a movie make.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Switchback''  &LR; _ Dennis Quaid, whose sense of humor has
softened some pretty bad roles, is dead serious as an FBI agent
searching for a serial killer. The convoluted script betrays its
own sense of logic. The only interesting element is Danny Glover's
chilling performance.

YOUNG COUPLE SHOULD PLAN FOR TAX HIT WHEN THEY CASH IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are both 34 years old and collectively earn
$380,000 a year. Our children are aged four and six, and a third is
on the way. Our house is appraised at $1.1 million, and there is a
$380,000 mortgage balance which I am determined to prepay within
three years.
</P>
<P>
   We have $465,000 in mutual fund accounts, of which $22,000 is
earmarked for our children's education, $80,000 in a high-yield
bond fund, and the rest in stock-dominated funds. I own a business
worth approximately $400,000 and have no debts.
</P>
<P>
   We make monthly contributions of $600 to the children's college
fund and $10,000 to investments or prepayments on the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   We hope to retire as soon as possible, although we may not make
that move for many years because we do enjoy working. We just want
the freedom to be able to retire. We anticipate we would need
$8,000 a month to support ourselves in retirement, provided the
mortgage has been retired.
</P>
<P>
   What are we doing right, and wrong? At what age can we retire?
Will the children's accounts be adequate for their college?
</P>
<P>
   I.N., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, the big thing you are doing right is earning a lot of
money at a relatively young age, and saving a lot of it. The only
wrong things I can see, unless you are omitting details, is that
you have adopted none of the various tax-deferral plans (such as
annuities, 0401(k)s, IRAs, SEP-IRAs, nor made investments designed
to reduce current taxes (such as municipal bonds or municipal bond
funds). Finally, you have perhaps underestimated your children's
likely college costs, and accordingly may be underfunding that
account.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, if you plan to retire at a very early age -- and
anywhere in your forties is mighty early -- you will need a great
deal more money than do people who retire later in life. This is
because your retirement funds need not only be sufficient to
provide you with an income stream, but there must also be
significant amounts put aside in long-term growth instruments which
will protect you against the inexorable ravages of future
inflation. Thus while you might calculate that a $1.4 million
savings pool could generate the desired $96,000 annual income
stream, you should probably have a minimum of an additional
$600,000 in the growth account, and given the vagaries of markets
and inflation rates, more would be a lot more comfortable. So let's
set a target of $2 million flat from the investment accounts,
calculating that the sale of your business could represent the
'more' if you chose retirement when the cash accounts reached that
level.
</P>
<P>
   Next, if you are resolved to pay off your mortgage within three
years, almost all of your current savings will be required there --
which seems fine to me, since I distrust the current market. So
let's presume that there are no additional to the investments
during the next three years, and that average annual growth during
that period is 8 percent (which is perhaps an ambitious
projection). That would take the accounts from $443,000 (since I
have put the college funds on another sheet) to $558,052. If you
then resumed contributing to the accounts at a $10,000 monthly
rate, and if we presume that for this longer haul you can achieve
average annual total returns of 10 percent, it would require 73
months -- a little more than six additional year -- for the account
to build to $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Thus by this reasoning you might retire in a total of nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   But of course that presumes there is no problem with the
children's education accounts.
</P>
<P>
   I did a fairly elaborate tally of likely total costs, which
space forbids inclusion in full, but the bottom line comes to a
total of $582,757 for the private college education of your three
children, beginning when each is 17, or of $225,493 if all were to
go to public schools.
</P>
<P>
   (These figures are based on the average costs supplied by the
Student Advantage Guide to Paying for College, published annually
by Random House, which presumes an ongoing 6 percent inflation in
college costs.) At your current savings rate, you will have
accumulated $203,295 in the college account by the time the first
child enters college in 11 years -- more than enough if all choose
public schools, but not enough if they go to private colleges, or
if they go to private schools with above-average costs.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I suggest two things: if possible, bump that $600
monthly contribution to the college fund to $1,000. Second, unless
you simply omitted details of tax-advantaged investments, I suggest
you have a good tax accountant go over your portfolio and make
whatever changes would serve to reduce both current and future tax
liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a 65-year-old woman, single and retired. After health
insurance payments, I have $1,400 monthly income. I also have
approximately $100,000 in savings and $60,000 in stock. Would it be
financially reckless for me to buy a condominium -- and also the
maximum price I might pay?
</P>
<P>
   M.N., Quincy, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. My first instinct was to simply say 'yes, it would be pretty
risky.' But I'll let you decide for yourself. Let's suppose you
were able to find a modest condo that could be purchased at a total
cost to you of $60,000. By total cost, I'm including not only the
purchase price, but also attorney's fees, other closing costs, and
the cost of moving.
</P>
<P>
   You might suppose that you could simply swap your stock holdings
for the condo -- but remember, if you have held the stock for some
time, you are likely to have capital gains in the positions, and
could thus face a nasty tax bill if you sold.
</P>
<P>
   But let's suppose that the tax liability is nonexistent or
minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Then let's look at your current housing costs versus the total
cost of the condo. We'll begin by looking first at the income
generated by your stock holdings -- the actual dividends -- and
also at the income stream that might be generated by that $60,000
if it were invested to produce an optimum income stream with
reasonable safety. For example, supposing you wouldn't face tax
liabilities if you sold, you might move that $60,000 into a good
government-guaranteed bond fund which could yield you $3,900 a
year. That is the amount of income you might be foregoing if you
bought the condo. But to that cost, you must add the real estate
taxes on the condo, the fee charged by the company managing the
condo association, the cost of insurance on the condo, and a
projected cost of maintaining the property. (In this latter
category, the costs can be discretionary on your part, such as
repainting or replacing cabinets, or it can be non-discretionary,
such as a new roof for the entire condo group which is dictated by
the ownership agreement or the vote of a majority of owners.) Let's
suppose the total figure for these costs comes to $200 a month.
Thus you can calculate that the total cost of the condo would be
$525 a month -- the $200 in ongoing expenses plus the $325 a month
that represents the maximum prudent income from your $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   How does that $525 a month (or whatever figure you have
calculated applying this approach to your own situation) compare to
your current rental cost, or to any alternative rental cost you may
contemplate? If the cost of the condo is significantly higher, you
probably should abandon the idea here.
</P>
<P>
   If you're still tempted, let's consider another set of
questions.
</P>
<P>
   How comfortably are you able to live within your $1,400 monthly
income. If you're usually right at the edge, or even are dipping
into your savings to get by from time to time, the condo is likely
in time to prove an increasing burden, and one from which it may be
difficult and/or expensive to extricate yourself.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are able to live fairly comfortable within your
income -- and perhaps even to make regular albeit modest additions
to your savings -- and if all of the numbers we went through above
work out in your favor, why not?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In a previous column you mention the Fidelity Insight and
FundsNet Insight newsletters.
</P>
<P>
   How can I get in touch with them?
</P>
<P>
   S.H., Valley Center, Calif.

AN FBI OUT OF BALANCE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With its wood veneer, lofty arched ceiling, and
ambience of power, Courtroom 5 in US District Court seems, in many
ways, an unusual venue for the deconstruction of the Boston office
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But the witnesses parading through the courtroom have told
sordid tales of how members of the nation's elite law enforcement
agency for years cozied up to two of Boston's most notorious
underworld figures and may have allowed them to commit crimes
without repercussions, all to keep the information flowing. To
protect those relationships, the agents and their supervisors hid
them from prosecutors and judges alike.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in the wake of a series of FBI controversies around the
country in recent years, from the assault at Ruby Ridge in 1992 to
the disclosures that the vaunted agency crime lab was a den of
incompetence and a potential nursery of flawed testimony, the
Boston developments have helped to undermine the tie-straight
professional FBI image of Efrem Zimbalist Jr.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Apparently, high-ranking Washington officials in the FBI and
Justice Department were frequently out of the loop concerning
crimes the Boston informants committed, indicating a flawed chain
of command. In response to problems of the last few years, Director
Louis J. Freeh says he has imposed reforms designed to better
manage local offices and operations, and to restore trust.
</P>
<P>
   Whether those reforms succeed is significant. For the plain
fact, is, how can the public have faith in its criminal justice
system if the nation's top law enforcement organization keeps
stumbling or, worse, can't be trusted?
</P>
<P>
   The ability of the FBI and its more than 11,000 special agents
to pursue crime across state lines and national boundaries (there
are 36 agents in 34 other countries), coupled with its budget of $3
billion, make it unique in US law enforcement. For decades, the
agency was showered with almost reflexive trust from the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent tarnish on its reputation is causing many people
to view the agency in a harsher light and is even prompting some
analysts to wonder whether highly professional investigations may
just as likely be found in reformed big city police departments,
where oversight of operations is much clearer and focused _ and
where local accountability is plain.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, big city departments such as in Boston and New York are
enjoying a resurgence of respect in recent years, and have been
showered with praise as their violent crime rates have dropped
dramatically. But the FBI, which has assisted city departments in
bringing down crime, has been mired in its crises, garnering little
favorable publicity for its role in cutting crime.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike local police departments, oversight of the FBI is
much more diffuse. Former Massachusetts Governor William Weld
testified in Courtroom 5 that he suspected that James J. ``Whitey''
Bulger, the reputed South Boston crime lord who allegedly
controlled the Irish mob, was an FBI informant. Even though Weld
was US Attorney from 1981 to 1986 _ and as such, the top federal
law enforcement official in the state and responsible for the
veracity of applications to federal judges for electronic
surveillance _ he never asked the FBI if his suspicions were
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I asked, I would have expected them to tell me to pound
sand,'' Weld said. While the names of informants are scrupulously
guarded, and agents may have felt wary revealing their identity to
an attorney who was likely to end up in private practice (as indeed
Weld has), his testimony spoke volumes about the lack of oversight
of the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suffolk District Attorney Ralph Martin would never put up with
`go pound sand,' and he would not hesitate to ask the question,''
says defense attorney Harvey Silverglate, who does not often spout
libertarian ideals. ``I think this is something true of federal law
enforcement that is much less true of state and local enforcement,
that the bigger the governmental unit, the less responsive it is.
``If this happened in the Boston Police Department, Martin would
raise holy hell. He is elected and can insist on answers. With the
FBI, the situation is so remote there is no one to demand
answers.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents and federal prosecutors also know that US attorneys
will come and go, but the bureau is there forever. ``They know they
can outlast us,'' says one former federal prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Oversight and examination are easy following a major controversy
such as at Ruby Ridge, where a 1992 standoff in Montana resulted in
the deaths of a US marshal from Quincy as well as the wife and son
of white separatist Randy Weaver, or at Waco, Texas, where 80
people died during a 1993 federal raid on the Branch Davidian
compound. Such monitoring comes not only from upper management but
also from Congress. Several oversight committees in the Senate and
House review FBI budgets, programs, and occassionally invididual
investigations. Still, in the two years after Waco, the FBI's
budget rose by $130 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be disastrous to have Congress micromanage
professionals at the FBI and federal prosecutors,'' says US
Representative Martin Meehan of Massachusetts, a member of the
House Judiciary Committee and a former prosecutor. ``Congress has
focused on investigatory tactics ... but it is always reactive. The
interest in Congress stems from what we hear about regarding cases,
and it is possible the Bulger case will result in scrutiny of the
FBI's use of informants.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This is a town where a power play is something
House Speaker Newt Gingrich does to rebellious Representative Bill
Paxon. This is a town where people are more concerned with red tape
than with the red line. This is a town where people think boarding
is something the president does at Andrews Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   This is one pitiful hockey town.
</P>
<P>
   And so there is something ridiculous about having this town's
team in the Stanley Cup finals, even if it is a championship fought
over by both right and left wings.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they play games in the nation's capital. Hockey just isn't
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Now if you're looking for cultural conflict, you couldn't do
better than Washington and Detroit, whose Red Wings are the
defending National Hockey League champions. Detroit, for example,
makes cars. Washington makes excuses.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty box in Washington is known as the grand jury, and
seldom does anyone spend only two minutes there.
</P>
<P>
   It is somewhat surprising that in a city where rule-making is an
actual adult occupation many of the fans don't know the rules of
this other game. They need a few pointers. They need to know there
is only oversight, not oversight hearings, in hockey. They need to
know there is a difference between a cross-check and Al Checchi,
between a conference final and a conference committee. And they
need to know there is a difference between a cheap shot and a
slapshot, though cheap shots are not unknown in hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh. In the conference championship against the Buffalo
Sabres, an apparent Capitals goal was disallowed immediately _ but
a minute later, Washington fans were still high-fiving each other
over a goal that wasn't. It was the equivalent of Redskins fans
getting rapturous over a touchdown reception ruled incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there is a core of hockey fans here. They're just
not at the Stanley Cup playoffs, which resume with Game 4 here
Tuesday night. They can't afford the tickets. Many of the
spectators are from somewhere else. Like Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   In real hockey towns _ whether Detroit, Chicago, Boston, or
Montreal _ there's a hockey culture. It includes parents who have
laced skates in zero degrees at dawn. People who know that icing
doesn't only come on a birthday cake. People who appreciate stories
about legends such as Maurice Richard, Gordie Howe, Phil Esposito,
Bobby Orr, and Wayne Gretsky.
</P>
<P>
   The principal figure in the Capitals' pantheon is Ivan Labre,
who played for the original Capitals but who is all but unknown
elsewhere in the league. Come to think of it, more people in
downtown D.C. could pick a freshman House member from Illinois out
of a lineup (where he may, in fact, belong) than could identify the
legendary Labre, who played on a Caps team that won only eight of
its 80 games.
</P>
<P>
   Here, people know Dave Bonior, the House minority whip from
Michigan. They hardly know Caps forward Peter Bondra, who scored
more goals than anyone else in the NHL over the last four seasons.
Here people know Duncan Hunter, the chairman of a House military
procurement subcommittee. They hardly know Dale Hunter, the Caps'
captain. Here people know Martin Olav Sabo, the ranking Democrat on
the House Transportation Committee. They hardly know the Caps' Olaf
Kolzig, one of the hottest goalies in the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the conference finals, the Sabres were the talk of the town
in Buffalo. The Capitals weren't even the talk of sports talk radio
in Washington. Even now, radio hosts mock hockey-mad callers,
dismissing them as ``Stanleys,'' as in, ``Get off the phone, you
Stanley,'' sort of the sports equivalent of asking a House
colleague to relinquish the balance of his time on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, President Clinton, who grew up in the hockey
hotbed of Hot Springs, Ark., showed up at MCI Center, the Capitals'
home arena. It was the first time any sitting president actually
sat through a hockey game. Well, not exactly. The leader of the
free world freed himself before the overtime period began.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, one of the events of the year is the Beanpot
Tournament, which begins on the first Monday in February among the
four college hockey teams in town: Boston College, Northeastern,
Boston University, and Harvard. In Washington, the first Monday in
February is usually when the president submits his annual budget.
You cannot buy nachos at an OMB briefing. Or yell at authority
figures.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, some Washingtonians tuned into a playoff game
on the Fox network, which has added a color flare, called the Fox
Trax, to its broadcast so that viewers may follow the puck more
easily. If the scene seemed familiar, it was only because many in
the group thought they were reliving the first night of the bombing
of Baghdad in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But grieve not if Washington fails to seize the Stanley Cup.
Life will still have meaning here. The House and the Senate have
yet to agree on the budget resolution. The funding bill for the
International Monetary Fund hasn't reached the House yet. And
midterm elections are only months away.

POOLS OFFER A BACKYARD PARADISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If you're looking to reduce stress, or to
exercise for physical therapy, health and weight control, or just
have plain old recreational fun, a swimming pool might be your
answer.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jack Cergol, marketing director of the National
Spas and Pool Institute in Alexandria, Va., there are approximately
3.5 million in-ground pools and 2.5 million above-ground pools in
America. New York has a particular affinity for backyard pools.
There were 477,000 above-ground pools in the Empire State in 1993,
according to statistics from the institute, a national trade
association.
</P>
<P>
   New York, the nation's third-most-populous state, ranked first
in above-ground pools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our most recent figures are still being compiled,'' said
Suzanne Stearns, communications manager for the institute. ``But I
would guestimate that there are another 40,000 to 50,000
above-ground pools that have been built since then. As you fly over
the state, all you see are little blue dots, to the rear of
houses.''
</P>
<P>
   That number may be growing, as more and more people are spending
more leisure time at home entertaining family and friends. Swimming
is a family activity, one that can be enjoyed by all ages.
</P>
<P>
   There are two pool options you can choose from: The in-ground
pool, which requires space digging, construction, deep pockets, and
in some cases, zoning approval; or an above-ground pool, which is
less expensive, impermanent and doesn't affect your property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The latter is a relatively easy way to cool off for summer.
</P>
<P>
   In-ground pools cost between $12,000 and $30,000. Above-ground
pools cost between $2,000 and $4,000, including installation.
</P>
<P>
   Also, used above-ground pools, sometimes taken as a trade in a
pool upgrade, may be reconditioned and spruced up with a new liner
and sold for between $500 and $1,000 depending on the size.
</P>
<P>
   The above-ground pool is often used as a steppingstone to an
in-ground pool, especially once the children have grown and honed
their swimming skills and water etiquette, said Mike Nogavero,
manager of Phoenix Pools of Upstate New York in Burnt Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of an in-ground pool can rise if you have abnormal
ground conditions, such as ledge rock or large boulders to dig
out,'' Nogavero said. ``An above-ground pool just needs a level
piece of land that's stable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a 21-foot round above-ground pool for my house as a
reason to build a deck,'' Nogavero said. ``It's great. Gather up
the family or a few friends, settle in the pool and call it a
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Above-ground pools are usually easy for the do-it-yourselfer and
they fit just about anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   As a safety precaution, an above-ground pool should never be
installed next to an overhanging area, such as a garage or house
roof, to prevent the roof from being used as a jumping-off point.
Diving boards and pool slides are also a no-no for above-ground
pools, because of the relatively shallow water level.
</P>
<P>
   Most above-ground pools are only 48 inches high to 52 inches
high, a swimming depth of about 4 feet.
</P>
<P>
   They come in a variety of sizes, starting with the smallest with
a 12-foot diameter to 41 feet long by 21 feet wide and almost 7
feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   Above-ground pools are easily filled with a garden hose. You
would need approximately 5,285 gallons of water to fill a
15-foot-diameter pool that is 4 feet deep, and 13,525 gallons for a
24-foot-diameter pool.
</P>
<P>
   If you have well water, you may want to have a water company
truck the water in for you.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the rust factor, most above-ground pools today are
made from resins and resin-coated steel to prevent corrosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may fade in 20 years,'' said Michael Giovanone, president
of Concord Pools in Latham, N.Y. ``But they will still look the
same, even the resin ladders. All of the auxiliary equipment,
including filters, pumps, skimmers and vacuums, are also all
noncorrosive. You'll get 20 to 30 years wear out of these compared
to five or more years with uncoated steel.''
</P>
<P>
   Above-ground pools should also have a main drain at the bottom
of the pool in the center, to maintain proper chemical balance,
circulation, water clarity and warmth. From the drain, the water is
recirculated through the filter, cleaned and sent back to the pool
through the return. Also, a heater can be added to an above-ground
pool. And a solar cover, which can be used to keep heat in at night
and on cloudy days, comes with most above-ground packages.
</P>
<P>
   Vinyl liners, which are now made as tough as the lining material
for the roof of a house, can create an inviting color or patterned
environment. Liners come in earth and sky tones, in florals,
mosaics, geometrics and abstract designs. But when choosing a
liner, look for a beaded one that fits in a track around the rim,
instead of folding over the top of the wall to the pool, where it
can get crimped and buckled rather than staying flush to the
contour of the pool, pool experts say.
</P>
<P>
   You would close an above-ground pool in winter as you would an
in-ground pool, by draining it to just a few inches to the bottom
of the skimmer and place a cover over the pool to keep debris out,
Giovanone said.
</P>
<P>
   Warranties vary from store to store. Many cover materials for as
long as the customer owns the pool and labor for one year. A
manufacturer's warranty differs from a dealer's warranty, where you
can get direct service. In a manufacturer's warranty, you may have
to pack the whole pool up and send it back to the manufacturer if
there should be a problem, Giovanone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the summer, our above-ground pool is the center of
activity, where even our dogs join in,'' Nogavero said. ``We bring
them in to swim with us. The only problem is that they can't get
out on their own. We need to help. But they love it and they don't
care what it costs.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you move, you can consider packing up the pool and taking
it with you.

 BOSTON: ... of informants.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oversight is much trickier in day-to-day crime fighting, present
and former federal officials acknowledge. When supervision is left
to upper echelons, those in charge, in large part, need to rely on
lower management to tell them what is going on. The FBI and
Department of Justice both have offices of professional
responsibility to conduct investigations, but that usually means
upper management must be aware of a potential problem.
</P>
<P>
   And if the US Attorney cannot ask a probing question, then it is
left up to the courts to review the actions of the FBI, such as
approving the use of a wiretap, or authorizing a search warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming director of the FBI in 1993, Freeh, a former
federal prosecutor and federal judge, has instituted numerous
changes in the agency's operations to ensure the integrity of the
court as a checkpoint. Classroom time on ethics at the FBI Academy
was increased from two hours to 18. And Freeh stopped agents from
using subterfuge to interrogate suspect Richard Jewell in
connection with the Olympic bombing. (Jewell eventually was
cleared.) Of particular concern for Freeh is that agents would be
less than truthful on the witness stand or would lie in submitting
applications to judges. He made it clear in a dispatch to all
offices that such conduct would no longer be tolerated _ even if
that meant letting a defendant walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's FBI is more open and accountable than ever in its
history,'' says Barry W. Mawn, special agent in charge of the
Boston office. ``We, like all organizations, are made up of
individuals who at times make mistakes ... When mistakes are made,
to include criminal misconduct, the FBI participates in identifying
and disclosing this activity and subsequently takes appropriate
action to hopefully prevent their recurrence.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all their efforts, the agency, and to some extent Freeh,
still have difficulty avoiding controversy. In 1996, the FBI was
criticized for turning over sensitive background investigation
files of Republicans to the White House, which Freeh called
``egregious violations of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Those FBI-conducted background investigations make some
politically ambitious officials, from prosecutors to judges, uneasy
in making waves against the agency, says Silverglate, adding,
``They have files on so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the FBI is unique, so too is American law enforcement in
its reliance on paid police informants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play a very rough game of balancing, of letting people off
for crimes in exchange for testimony. It is very American and it is
very effective. We get a great deal for it,'' says Harvard Law
School professor Philip Heymann, the former deputy attorney general
in charge of the Criminal Division. In 1980, he authored guidelines
dealing with informants.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is like a very powerful form of chemotherapy. It is
playing with dynamite, and clearly, we are not good enough at
regulating it,'' says Heymann, who declined to discuss the current
case. ``It is a terrible problem, and it is not getting any better.
If there is a scandal, it is that by now, it ought to be better.''
</P>
<P>
   That relationship between police and informants is the source of
the stench coming from Courtroom 5.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary revelations in the unfolding testimony point
to a litany of problems created by using Bulger and his alleged
cohort in crime and snitching, Steven ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi, as
informants:
</P>
<P>
   _ Retired Special Agent John Morris, a former organized crime
supervisor, acknowledged he took $7,000 and two cases of wine from
the reputed mobsters.
</P>
<P>
   _ FBI supervisors and John Connolly, the now retired agent who
``handled'' Bulger, allegedly protected Bulger and Flemmi from
other investigations, as varied as whether a city public works crew
was doing work on a liquor store with ties to Bulger, to something
more routine: Bulger and Flemmi shaking down drug dealers in South
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   _ Morris also said he told Connolly that an alleged fringe
player, Edward ``Brian'' Halloran, had implicated Bulger and Flemmi
in the 1981 murder of Roger Wheeler, a World Jai Alai executive in
Oklahoma. Halloran was murdered shortly thereafter, and Morris
suspected Bulger and Flemmi were involved. While the FBI
photographed and fingerprinted them and questioned them in 1983 in
connection with Wheeler's slaying, the information was not passed
on to Oklahoma authorities. Bulger and Flemmi continued to work as
FBI informants.
</P>
<P>
   _ Agents and supervisors dining with the informants was
commonplace. Sometimes they'd eat at the home of an agent,
sometimes at the home of a gangster. Gifts were exchanged at
Christmas. And when Connolly told Morris that the two informants
demanded a ``head start'' in return for the information, Morris did
not object. Flemmi contends Bulger fled before he could be
arrested, tipped off by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the 1970s, agents planted a phony bomb in the car of a man
they were trying to terrify into becoming an informant. The ploy
did not work.
</P>
<P>
   _ James Ring, another retired organized crime supervisory agent,
said that Angelo ``Sonny'' Mercurio was kept as an informant after
he engaged in the attempted murder of Salemme in 1989, even though
there had been discussions about dropping him before the shooting
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Morris, Connolly has not been offered immunity and has
not testified. In prior interviews, he denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's apparent disregard for Heymann's earlier guidelines is
now a constant theme in the questioning of agents by defense
attorney Martin Weinberg in Courtroom 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hearings have been extremely damaging to the FBI,'' says
Meehan. ``The result, ultimately, will be substantive changes in
how cooperation results in criminal cases. But when controversies
like this are damaging, they serve a very useful purpose.
Corrections need to be made, and will be made, and the FBI will
continue to be one of the most effective law enforcement agencies
in the world.''

<P>
   ORANGE, Calif. -- It's a girl, silly.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Cara-Beth Burnside repeats the line, she laughs out
loud. As the ``girl'' in question, she knows how unexpected her
performance is, or used to be. Now more and more young women are
showing the same guts on their skate-boards as the guys. And
Burnside is among the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   The line that gets her laughing again and again is in a new TV
commercial for a shoe by Vans Inc., the one with her signature
inside and a copy of her sunburst tattoo on the heel, the one she
helped design and that brings in the royalty checks.
</P>
<P>
   Art imitating life, Burnside is at first mistaken for a guy in
the ad. After all, she's got the attitude and the elevation, not to
mention the baggy clothes. Then a squad of cheerleaders realizes
he's a she and goes wild, until Burnside knocks them over with her
board in another of Vans' good-natured digs at team sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a crack-up,'' Burnside said after the shoot, which was
delayed briefly until a helmet could be found, since she's trying
to avoid a sixth concussion. ``I love hearing them yell, `Go, girl,
go.' That's not something girl skaters get to hear a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnside, the first and only female skateboarder with a shoe of
her own, is out to change all that. At skating clinics, shopping
malls, anywhere the Southern California-based Vans sends her, she
talks up girls and young women who want to ride like her, want to
be like her. Even in celebrity-jaded LA, a crowd of boys and girls
gathers to watch her stretch out midair until her body was almost
parallel to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   She is, of course, selling shoes _ more than 150,000 pairs since
they hit stores late last year. As an athlete in one of the
perilous board-riding sports _ skateboarding, snowboarding,
wakeboarding, street luge _ Burnside is suddenly big business.
She's upfront about wanting to cash in as a skateboarder and
Olympic medalist in snowboarding while her knees and elbows and
other joints last. But she's also selling acceptance in a sport
where female role models remain almost as rare as when she was a
girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been suggested that girls skateboard before,'' said
Burnside, who picked up her first board at age 11. ``But if they
promote it as too gnarly, girls won't be into it. I want to show
they can have fun and look good, too. Too many girls worry about
makeup and being popular and stuff like that instead of being
productive at something they could be good at.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnside, approaching 30 but reluctant to be more specific about
her age, knows firsthand how hard it can be for girl skaters. Until
the Vans deal came along, no matter how good she got, as a
teen-ager and then as a college student at the University of
California Davis campus, she couldn't make even a meager living
skateboarding. There were no endorsement deals, no big-stakes
competitions. So she did what any all-round athelete would do: She
switched one so-called extreme sport for another.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the avid surfer chose another board sport.
This time it was snowboarding and she had women to compete against
all the way to the Olympics. In the inaugural snowboarding
competition, Burnside rode her signature orange board to third
place in the women's half-pipe. The board, like all of her gear,
save the sunglasses supplied by yet another sponsor, was courtesy
of Burton Snowboards in Burlington, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cara-Beth's a very aggressive individual,'' Barry Dugin,
Burton's team promotions manager said of the 5-foot 3-inch
Burnside, who weighs maybe 120 pounds in her snowsuit. ``She packs
an unbelievable amount of energy into a small frame.''
</P>
<P>
   In snowboarding, Burnside has found a world of women she hopes
to replicate in skateboarding. For her it's personal, as well as
professional. While she stars in Vans competitions as well as the
Santa Fe Springs company's print and TV ads, she also chats up girl
skaters at city parks. More than a few of them know her on sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cara-Beth rules,'' said Melissa Longfellow, co-publisher of
Fresh &AMP; Tasty, a Cambridge-based snowboarding magazine for young
women with a circulation of 75,000. ``She's one of those people
who's been snowboarding for a long time and, as everyone knows,
skateboarding is a million times harder so you have to give her a
lot of credit. ... In our world, she's an icon now.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a name brand, however, can be exhausting. Burnside may
make riding the ramp look like fun, but to her it's business. She
knows her competing years are limited. These days, in fact, she's
so busy with deals and endorsements that she doesn't get to skate
or snowboard nearly as much as she'd like. She hasn't surfed once
this year, sacrilege in the Orange County town where she grew up
and still keeps her equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Stretched out in her parents' Jacuzzi the other day, a portable
phone in one hand, a pen in the other, Burnside did business the
California way: in a red bikini with matching Arnett sunglasses.
She had airline reservations to make for a competition, photo
sessions to arrange, a weekend with her niece and nephews to plan.
Sure she was in the sun. But she made clear she wasn't relaxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think you just wake up and skate, but with all these
sponsors and endorsements, it's not like that,'' said Burnside, who
does try to get in three hours a day on her skateboard, sometimes
late in the evening. ``But it's a total business thing. I want to
make a living out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The schedule includes as many as nine snowboard competitions a
year, plus her work for Vans and her other sponsors. She shows up
at some skateboarding events, shuns others when she feels women
aren't wanted. She describes a recent event in Canada as ``not
really a thing for girls. They're all for guys.'' She pauses, then
adds, ``That's changing.''
</P>
<P>
   The guys don't scare Burnside, though _ never did. She used to
play full contact football for fun and score off the boys. She
studied karate. The back of a trading card with her likeness on it
boasts that she's been known to shame the guys red with her
skateboarding tricks. She's also careful to note that she's always
in control, even when she's flying through the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that dangerous,'' insisted Burnside, who has broken
her arm and a couple fingers and spent the night in the hospital
when she whacked her head. ``I'm not into jumping out of a plane.
Anyone can do that, doesn't take much of a brain. I'm not into the
adrenaline rush. I like tricks, skills. It's not a daredevil thing
for me. It's not like I drive ridiculously fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnside is too cool for that. With a toss of her ponytail, she
says she was stoked but not stunned to find herself at the
Olympics. Even so, she is not, she says, ``an Olympic-type
athlete.'' She likes training on her own time at her own pace,
which makes the individualism of extreme sports perfectly suited
for her. The skateboard goes most everywhere with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need a coat; I don't need anyone,'' said Burnside. ``I
can go anywhere I want. I'll always skate. But I don't know how
long I can do this competitively. That's why I'm out there making
things happen while I can.''

 UNDATED: ... governs anxiety.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So far, there's ``no evidence of physical or psychological
dependence,'' adds Dr. David Mischoulon, a psychiatrist and
psychopharmacologist at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But even those sympathetic to herbal remedies urge caution,
among them Dr. Laura Kramer, a psychiatrist at the American
WholeHealth Arlington-Cambridge (Mass.)Center.
</P>
<P>
   Unless your doctor advises otherwise, she says, you should not
drive or operate machinery while taking kava because it may make
you drowsy. Nor should you take it with other drugs that act on the
central nervous system, including alcohol or prescription
anti-anxiety drugs like benzodiazepines. At high doses, kava may
cause intoxication.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to treat kava as a medication _ you have to respect
it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And start with low doses, about 70 to 85 mg of kavalactones,
taken at night, says California psychiatrist Bloomfield. If that's
not enough, he says, take a second pill in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   If, after a week, that is still not enough, you can add a third
pill at midday. But once you're feeling consistently more relaxed,
taper down by one pill every few days.
</P>
<P>
   And if, despite three pills a day, you're still very anxious,
don't waste any more time. Call your doctor.

OTHER HERBAL REMEDIES TO CONSIDER &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kava is currently the hottest herbal treatment for anxiety, but
other plant medicines may also help. Before you experiment, though,
talk to your doctor. Many herbs can cause allergic reactions. And
don't take multiple psychoactive drugs of any type _ including
alcohol and herbals _ at the same time, unless a doctor says
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Among the herbs often used for anxiety are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Valerian &LR; . This herb has been used for more than 1,000 years
as a minor tranquilizer and sleep inducer. Both the German
Commission E and the World Health Organization have reviewed it and
deemed it safe and effective. For insomnia, the suggested dose is
450 to 600 milligrams of valerian extract at bedtime. It may take
two to four weeks before you see any effect.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Eight placebo-controlled, double-blind studies show valerian
reduces the time it takes to fall asleep. Data also suggest that
valerian improves mood and scores on a commonly-used anxiety rating
scale. But the stuff smells awful, and doses vary. So read the
labels and stick to the recommended doses.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; St. John's Wort. &LR;  This herbal anti-depressant may also help
with anxiety, says the German Commision E, though the data are
skimpy. Unlike kava, which works right away, St. John's Wort _
taken as a 300 mg pill three times a day _ takes two to four weeks
to kick in. Dr. Harold Bloomfield, a California psychiatrist, often
starts patients on kava for its immediate effects and adds St.
John's Wort, then tapers off kava as St. John's Wort kicks in. St.
John's Wort can cause sun sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; _ &UR; Chamomile &LR; . The German Commission E and WHO approve this for
nervous upset and mild insomnia _ especially as a tea or extract.
Though a 1994 study shows it contains apigenin, an anti-anxiety
agent, it's weaker than valerian and kava. People who are allergic
to ragweed, chrysanthemums, and other plants in the daisy family
should avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Passion Flower &LR; .  &UR; Hops. Lavender. Lemon balm. &LR;  All these herbs
are approved by the German Commission E, but there's little
scientific data to support their use for anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Catnip &LR; . Pure folklore. There are few, if any, studies of its
safety and efficacy. (Like valerian, catnip jazzes up cats but
sedates people _ for utterly mysterious reasons.)

 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 9:20 a.m. on March 17, cardiac surgeon James Symes stood in
an operating room at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston,
picked up a syringe that a nurse had playfully labelled ``Good for
Heart,'' and poked it into the hole he had cut between John
Barlow's ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Symes stuck the needle into Barlow's beating but battered heart
at a spot where he thought there was still some viable muscle.
Taking care not to pierce through the heart wall into the pumping
chamber, he squeezed off an injection. Two. Three. Four.
</P>
<P>
   Each shot of ``the good stuff,'' as Symes called it, contained
several million pieces of ``naked DNA'' carrying the genetic code
for a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF for
short. Doctors expected about five percent of the genes to get into
Barlow's heart muscle cells, and hopefully induce them to secrete
VEGF.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was as revolutionary as the procedure was
straightforward: To grow a new blood supply for oxygen-starved
sections of Barlow's 70-year-old heart.
</P>
<P>
   It may actually work. Recent preliminary results in dozens of
patients are raising cardiologists' (and drug companies') hopes
that the field may be on the threshold of the next big thing in
treating advanced heart disease, an advance comparable to the
advent of coronary bypass surgery in the 1970s, or of angioplasty,
the artery-reaming technology of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Before the VEGF gene injections, Barlow, a Cape Cod retiree who
has survived three heart attacks and multiple heart operations,
needed a dozen or more nitroglycerine pills for severe angina pain
every day. Now he pedals an exercise bicycle for 20 minutes at a
time and bench-presses 100 pounds without a twinge.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``It seems to have done a lot of good,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen improvement in almost every one of the eight
patients we've treated to date,'' says Dr. Jeffrey M. Isner, chief
of cardiovascular research at St. Elizabeth's. ``Some have done
spectacularly well, with changes every bit as profound as you get
with successful bypass surgery or angioplasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Results at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston,
involving a similar blood vessel-promoting protein called
fibroblast growth factor or FGF, are equally encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen patients go from Class IV symptoms _ basically
bedridden because of angina pain _ to power-walking,'' says Dr.
Michael Simons, who will report his first results on 24 patients
this month in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery. ``We think this is
going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Next month, a ``large, definitive study of FGF'' will get under
way in multiple US medical centers, Simons says. Patients will get
the protein _ not its gene _ or an inert placebo, both injected
through a catheter that has been snaked into the coronary arteries,
an approach that obviates the need for surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, it will be a long time before coronary
angiogenesis, as this budding new field is called, will replace
bypass surgery and angioplasty. Those warhorse procedures have
liberated countless patients from angina pain and often extended
their lives. A million Americans have one or the other procedure
every year.
</P>
<P>
   But heart researchers have long dreamed of finding a way to
mimic the natural process by which oxygen-starved heart tissue
calls forth new blood vessels, called ``collaterals,'' to
compensate for diminished flow through clogged coronaries. In
advanced disease, this natural process can't compensate adequately,
so scientists hope to amplify it.
</P>
<P>
   Not only would brand-new coronary vessels be less likely to
reclog rapidly, as bypass grafts and angioplasty-cleared coronaries
often do, but they would sprout exactly where they are needed,
researchers say. That's because the receptors on blood vessel walls
that grab VEGF or FGF are naturally more plentiful in areas where
muscle tissue is most ischemic, or oxygen-starved.
</P>
<P>
   ``For VEGF to work, it has to bind to receptors, which are only
presented in ischemic tissues,'' says Dr. Timothy Henry, director
of interventional cardiology at Hennepin County Medical Center in
Minneapolis. ``That's the beauty of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Therapeutic angiogenesis would be the polar opposite of the
anti-cancer strategy of starving tumors, which recently captured
worldwide attention on the basis of animal experiments. But it is
rooted in the same research, pioneered since the early 1970s by
Boston surgeon M. Judah Folkman. In fact, one of the experimental
anti-angiogenesis drugs for cancer is called anti-VEGF.
</P>
<P>
   Isner, who is credited with pathfinding angiogenesis work in
animals, last November presented persuasive evidence that it can
often work in a disabling disorder called peripheral vascular
disease, which obstructs blood flow in leg arteries and causes
excrutiating pain during walking, or even at rest, often leading to
gangrene and amputations.
</P>
<P>
   VEGF genes injected into patients' legs grew new blood vessels
in 15 of 20 patients (the total is now up to 37, with similar
results). Some patients avoided amputation, their leg ulcers
healed, and they were able to walk longer distances. Among those
who improved, the effect has lasted up to three years so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``About one-third of these patients have a virtually complete
response, a third have a very favorable response _ allowing them to
get by with only a toe amputation, for instance _ and a third don't
respond at all,'' Isner says.
</P>
<P>
   Older patients with more advanced disease don't respond to VEGF
gene therapy as well, a finding that may hint at which heart
patients will benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The partial but often impressive success of efforts to grow new
blood vessels in the leg unleashed a competitive rush among
scientists and drug companies to demonstrate the same thing in
heart disease patients, a far bigger market. In February, German
researchers claimed preliminary success, although skeptics noted
that the increased blood flow could have been due to the bypass
surgery performed at the same time they injected FGF.
</P>
<P>
   But Genentech, Chiron, and other companies are betting heavily
that the technology will work. Isner recently announced the
formation of a new company, Vascular Genetics, to commercialize the
work after $10 million in research funding provided thus far by St.
Elizabeth's.
</P>
<P>
   Questions and competing approaches abound. The first issue is
safety, although the experience so far has flashed a yellow light
that is allowing researchers to move ahead cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   The main worry is that the blood vessel growth factors could
either nourish the blood supply of undetected cancers and promote
their growth, or cause damaging overgrowth of vessels in tissues
such as the retina of the eye or the kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   Patients receiving angiogenesis genes or proteins are screened
and monitored for cancer or other diseases, and so far there has
been no suggestion of a problem. ``You may actually promote tumor
metastases, but that's a concern we probably won't know too much
about for many years,'' says Dr. Stephen Ellis, a Cleveland Clinic
cardiologist.
</P>
<P>
   Proving efficacy is the other big hurdle. The symptom relief
felt by Barlow and a few others is impressive to doctors and
patients, and there is some data suggesting that blood flow to the
heart has improved.
</P>
<P>
   In Barlow's case, for instance, preoperative radionuclide scans
showed two dark spots in his heart after doctors injected a drug
that &UR;  &LR; increases the heart's oxygen demands. The dark spots
represent areas of poor blood flow.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the VEGF gene injections, a repeat scan revealed
that one of the dark spots had vanished, which Isner considers
clear evidence of new blood flow. ``It's almost inconceivable that
the improvement on radioisotope scans could be from chance,'' Isner
says.
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics remain, even among those who would like to believe.
``I would caution that physically injecting anything into the heart
muscle might stimulate angiogenesis without any effect from VEGF,''
notes Simons. ``Whenever you injure the heart muscle, you stimulate
angiogenesis.''
</P>
<P>
   To be convincing, Simons and other say, studies will have to
compare patients with similar severity of disease who received
angiogenesis stimulators or placebo injections.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also must compare the effects of VEGF and FGF,
direct injections into heart muscle versus intravenous infusions,
whether injection of genes or the actual proteins themselves works
better, different doses, and dozens of other variables.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, studies thus far suggest that VEGF produces
smaller vessels, while FGF stimulates larger vessels, perhaps
approaching the diameter of original coronary arteries. Both
effects might be helpful, although some believe that larger vessels
will be better. Ultimately, the growth promoters might be given in
combination or in sequence.
</P>
<P>
   One big question, which must await many further studies of
safety and effectiveness, is who will benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The first candidates for coronary angiogenesis will be patients
like Barlow who are out of other options. ``Perhaps 60,000 to
120,000 patients who undergo cardiac catheterization every year are
not good candidates for bypass surgery or angioplasty'' because
their coronary arteries are so extensively clogged or they are
considered high-risk, notes Ellis of the Cleveland Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, researchers hope angiogenesis factors will be
used either in conjunction with conventional bypass surgery or
angioplasty, or possibly long before they become necessary, in the
hope of deferring these invasive procedures _ perhaps permanently
for some.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were simple and safe enough to perform, it might be
enough to reduce the amount of medication patients need or put off
the need for surgery or angioplasty,'' Isner says. ``In your
dreams, that's what you'd like to anticipate.''

KAVA ROOT IS THE HOT HERB FOR ANXIETY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (Includes where to get help sidebars)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY FOREMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tradionally, whenever the people of the South Pacific islands
wanted to welcome a visitor or provide a social lubricant for
communal rituals, they drank a potent potion made from the roots of
an intoxicating pepper plant, kava kava.
</P>
<P>
   The jaw-breaking job of turning the tough root of the Piper
methysticum into homemade brew fell to young virgins _ male or
female, depending on the island _ who spent hours chewing the root,
then spitting out the masticated mush into a communal pot, where it
was left to mature for several hours before being quaffed.
</P>
<P>
   The effects, says herbal ``medicine hunter'' and kava &UR;  &LR; promoter
Chris Kilham of Lincoln, were nearly instantaneous: a feeling of
profound well-being and relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   What more could one ask? Okay, maybe a little scientific
validation. And access.
</P>
<P>
   Westerners are beginning to get both. In fact, although there
are other herbs that are said to allay anxiety, it's kava that
seems poised to take off like St. John's Wort, the herbal
antidepressant that was virtually unheard of a couple of years ago
in this country and now commands $200 million a year in sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kava market has come out of nowhere. It's gone from next
to nothing to $40 to $50 million in sales in one year,'' says
Thomas Aarts, executive editor of the Nutrition Business Journal in
San Diego. At that, it's still a small chunk of the booming
business in dietary supplements, which has grown 14 percent a year
for the last three years to $11.5 billion now, driven in part by
the popularity of herbals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kava is a hot herb,'' agrees Matthew Patsky, a stock analyst
who specializes in the natural food and nutrition industry for
Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill, a Boston investment bank. ``It works great
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say kava induces a state of relaxation without fogging
the mind as some prescription tranquilizers can. Kava produces ``a
delightful feeling,'' enthuses Kilham, who consults for herbal
products companies that import or market kava.
</P>
<P>
   Since many things that sound too good to be true are, some
caveats: The scientific evidence on the benefits and possible risks
of kava is still limited. &UR;  &LR; There have been 38 double-blind,
placebo-controlled studies on St. John's Wort, also known as
Hypericum, says Dr. Harold Bloomfield, a California psychiatrist
who has written a book on it.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, there are only a half dozen decent studies on
kava, he says. ``We need many, many more _ this is preliminary
research at best.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven E. Hyman, director of the National Institute of
Mental Health, agrees, calling the kava data ``quite weak.'' But
NIMH is intrigued enough that it may fund research on it.
</P>
<P>
   If the research is not yet there, the need is: An estimated 23
million Americans wrestle with crippling, life-wrecking, chronic
anxiety, and millions more suffer milder forms.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there are mainstream treatments available, including
anti-anxiety drugs like Valium, Xanax and Klonopin, which are often
effective but can cause cause physical dependence. Non-habit
forming drugs like Prozac, an anti-depresssant, also work against
anxiety, as does cognitive-behavior therapy and other ``talking''
psychotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this, there's still enough angst out there that the
potential demand for herbal tranquilizers is huge.
</P>
<P>
   You should, of course, consult your doctor before
self-medicating for severe anxiety _ or any other serious medical
problem. But if you decide to try kava, here's what you need to
know.
</P>
<P>
   The active ingredients in kava go by two interchangeable names:
kavalactones or kavapyrones. Check the label _ it should say each
capsule is ``standardized'' to roughly 75 milligrams of
kavalactones or kavapyrones, meaning the concentration is
consistent from batch to batch. (Note: Kava pills come in varying
strengths _ from 100 to 250 mg _ and the percentage of kavalactones
also varies. A 250-mg capsule of 30 percent extract would contain
75 mg of kavalactones.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The German Commission E, a government-appointed panel that
reviews herbal remedies, has approved kava to combat anxiety,
stress and restlessness and recommends a dose of 60 to 120
milligrams a day of kavapyrones.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Mahady, a pharmacist and plant medicine specialist at the
University of Illinois, adds that side effects are apparently rare.
A monograph she's writing for the World Health Organization will
endorse the use of kava for anxiety symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are allergic to it, &UR;  &LR; however, especially those with
known allergies to pepper, and kava can cause a temporary yellowing
of the skin if used too long. The German commission recommends
using it for not more than three months and says pregnant or
nursing women and people with serious depression should not take it
at all.
</P>
<P>
   For many people, though, kava appears to be both safe and
effective at the recommended doses, says Varro Tyler, a plant
medicine specialist emeritus at Purdue University &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, six carefully-done studies of kava extracts, all done
in Germany since 1989, show kava is ``quite satisfactory'' when
compared to a placebo or a prescription anti-anxiety drug such as
oxazepam (Serax), Tyler adds.
</P>
<P>
   Kava is not only a potent muscle relaxant, it also acts, just as
alcohol and prescription anti-anxiety drugs do, on so-called GABA
receptors in the brain, which regulate anxiety. Kava may also quiet
a brain region, the amygdala, which also governs anxiety.

NEW TELESCOPES PAY OFF IN THE DETAILS 
</HEADLINE>
 SCOPES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Astronomers in the 1990s are seeing the dawn of an
unprecedented golden age: New telescopes of a size and power
undreamed of just a few years ago are busting out all over,
promising to open the floodgates for a cascade of discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, astronomers unveiled the ``first light'' images
of a new telescope that will survey the night skies to produce the
definitive roadmap of the heavens for decades to come. Two weeks
earlier, a new instrument prosaically called the Very Large
Telescope, whose makers say it is now the most powerful in the
world, produced its own dazzling ``first light'' pictures _ the
astronomers' term for the first usable astronomical images from a
new scope.
</P>
<P>
   Much more is on the way: While the venerable 200-inch Hale
telescope on Palomar Mountain reigned supreme for nearly four
decades, four new telescopes that surpass it have been completed
this decade, and at least a half-dozen more will join the ranks
over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors have combined to make this remarkable telescopic
rennaissance possible: The dramatic and ever-growing power of
computers to control huge scopes with pinpoint precision using
smaller, simpler mountings, breakthrough concepts for making the
giant slabs of glass for telescope mirrors, and innovative
barn-like replacements for the unwieldy observatory domes of yore.
</P>
<P>
   The Very Large Telescope, built by a consortium of eight nations
known as the European Southern Observatory and installed on a
mountaintop called Cerro Paranal in the Chilean Andes, will
eventually consist of four identical linked telescopes. When
completed in two years, the four telescopes will be arrayed so that
their light can be combined, simulating one telescopic behemoth far
bigger than any telescope in existence or planned. (The Hubble
telescope, by contrast, gains its power to see fine detail by
escaping the atmosphere's turbulence; the scope itself is modest in
size, exceeded by no fewer than 30 telescopes around the world.)
</P>
<P>
   Even now, with just one of its telescopes completed, the Chilean
observatory reports that its first images demonstrate an ability to
detect fine details _ called ``resolving power'' _ that ``even at
this early stage, is unequalled by any large ground-based
telescope.''
</P>
<P>
   The telescope's main mirror is 8.2 meters, or about 27 feet, in
diameter _ making it the largest one-piece telescope mirror now in
service. It is unlike any of the other large telescope mirrors now
in use or being built: It is made of a thin sheet of glass glued
onto a honeycomb supporting structure. This unusual design makes it
flexible enough so that tiny computer-controlled devices can
constantly monitor and adjust its surface shape.
</P>
<P>
   Other large mirrors have either been assembled from an array of
hexagonal pieces fitted together like a tile floor, or cast in one
large solid piece to give them enough strength to hold their shape,
but with hollowed-out spaces in the back to lower their weight. The
VLT's innovative flexible mirrors may set a new standard for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   But size isn't everything. The Sloan Digital Sky survey uses a
new telescope whose mirror is neither exceptionally large (albeit
slightly bigger than Hubble's) nor unusual in design. But this new
telescope, based at Apache Point, N.M., is innovative in other
ways: A unique robotically-controlled system can move 640 optical
fibers so that each one aligns with a specific galaxy in the
scope's unusually wide field of view. That enables it to take
spectrograms _ spreading out the colors of the object's light to
reveal its chemical composition, distance and motion _ of hundreds
of galaxies at once.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it is completed, the telescope's survey will have
determined the distance and velocity of a million galaxies and
100,000 quasars _ far more than all the world's telescopes combined
have produced in the history of astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   The unusually sensitive and comprehensive coverage of this new
survey is expected to provide the photographic ``maps'' of the
heavens that astronomers will use to plan and guide their
observations for the next 50 years. To demonstrate its power,
astronomers last week rolled out a 35-foot-long panoramic image of
one tiny patch of sky, compiled from the telescope's ``first
light'' observations, at a meeting of the American Astronomical
Society.
</P>
<P>
   But these two new telescopes are just a few of the innovative,
powerful new instruments now nearing completion around the world.
Among the others:
</P>
<P>
   _The Large Binocular Telescope. Being built on Arizona's Mount
Graham after years of court battles with environmental groups
worried about the observatory's impact on the mountain's rare red
squirrels, this scope will carry a pair of 8.4 meter mirrors on a
single, large mounting. By combining the light from the two
mirrors, it should achieve a resolving power equal to a telescope
with a single mirror with a diameter of 23 meters, or 75 feet. The
first of its twin mirrors was cast last year in the unique spinning
furnace of the University of Arizona's mirror lab.
</P>
<P>
   _The Subaru telescope. Nearing completion in Hawaii by a
Japanese group, this telescope is equal in size to one of the VLT's
four telescopes, and it will provide a northern complement to that
southern-hemisphere observatory.
</P>
<P>
   _The Multiple Mirror Telescope conversion on Arizona's Mount
Hopkins. After years of successful operation with a telescope that
used an array of six mirrors on a single mount, the scope _
operated by the Cambridge-based Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics _ was shut down this spring for a yearlong conversion
process to a single 6.5 meter (or 21 foot) mirror. Its new mirror
was another product of the University of Arizona's spinning
furnace. The conversion is expected to be completed and the
telescope returned to active research by the middle of next year. A
twin telescope, called Magellan, is being built in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   _The Gemini telescopes. Another pair of twins, one in Hawaii and
one in Chile, will each have 8 meter (26 foot) telescopes. Being
built by a seven-nation collaboration, the first of the twin
scopes, on Hawaii's Mauna Kea, is expected to see first light this
December.
</P>
<P>
   With this dazzling array of powerful new instruments,
astronomers are expecting a wealth of data and discoveries unlike
anything the field has seen before. ``This is not just a new
telescope, this is a science factory'' said James Crocker, an
astronomer at Johns Hopkins University, last week in describing the
new Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Margon, an astronomer at the University of Washington and
science director for the Sloan survey, added that by the time that
survey finishes its five-year mapping of the heavens, it will have
produced 10 terabytes of data (that's 10,000,000,000,000 bytes),
equal to the total amount of information currently stored in the
Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the first images from the Very Large Telescope have
already achieved a resolution of about one-quarter of an arcsecond
_ far better than astronomers just a few years ago believed could
ever be achieved by an Earth-based telescope. That's a power
equivalent to being able to see the separate headlight beams of a
car 750 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The total power of the new instruments should make it possible
to gain new insights into the arrangements of stars and galaxies in
space, revealing how the universe has evolved since the Big Bang,
and to discover entirely new kinds of objects in the vast reaches
of the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   It's the culmination of a revolution that may be unequalled
since Rene Descartes summed up the impact of Galileo's first use of
a telescope to study the heavens just a quarter-century earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``By taking our sense of sight far beyond the realm of our
forebears' imagination,'' he wrote in 1637, ``these wonderful
instruments, the telescopes, open the way to a deeper and more
perfect understanding of nature.''

A NOVEL OF STRONG WOMEN WITH FRESH, DISTINCT VOICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CLEA SIMON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE MERMAIDS SINGING 
By Lisa Carey 
Bard, 257 pp., $22 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mingling myth and motherhood, and jumping generations and
continents, former Bostonian Lisa Carey has created a magical first
novel. And in this lovely book, which intertwines three complicated
and realistic life stories, the magic is as often in what we don't
see on the page as it is in what we do. Despite the temptations to
turn treacly as mothers and daughters lose and then find one
another again oceans away, Carey's story of three generations of
strong women manages to avoid the sticky stain of sentimentality,
instead presenting with nuance and balance believable characters
who grow and change.
</P>
<P>
   This is not an easy task, because the Irish-American Carey (a
Boston College graduate and former Brookline Booksmith employee)
not only chooses relationships that have become the stuff of
cliche, but also jumps from such heavily written-about populations
as the Boston Brahmins to the rural Irish and back again,
rediscovering roots galore as she mixes in touches of Irish magic
and legend, particularly the mermaids of the title. Traveling back
to the ``auld sod,'' in this case a barren rocky island called Inis
Muruch, with grandmother Cliona, mother Grace, and the teenage
Grainne, Carey sticks to true emotion, and that elevates her
predictable mother-daughter conflicts. In ``The Mermaids Singing''
we see tears and lost opportunities, but also witness a bereaved
mother's fierce anger upon hearing that her daughter died without
her, and a daughter's denial that her mother is dying _ a denial
both foolish and heartbreaking, because it is rooted in the younger
woman's hope against all reason that wishing will make it so.
</P>
<P>
   The action of this novel is not all unexpected: On their paths
from Ireland to Boston and back again, all of these women go
through heartbreak and sexual thrill-seeking, searching all the
while for the community and love they could find in each other, if
they only recognized it. But though such interactions are simple,
even predictable, they are related here with such clarity and
honesty that their unfolding _ and the book that holds them all _
rise above the mundane, and certainly above the expected
intergenerational mush that makes up so much ``women's fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit goes to the 28-year-old author. Carey crafts her three
protagonists with a keen ear for language. Avoiding the easy outs
of overdone dialect and accent, she nonetheless situates her people
in place and time with very few words: ``It's still my belief that
if I'd gotten Grace home earlier, when she was still the wee child,
she'd be living in Ireland today,'' says Cliona, beginning one of
her sections. Just a few words _ the choice of an article and an
adjective _ place her as as both Irish and of an older generation.
Such distinct voices add to the stories' individuality, gently
coloring the three first-person narratives to fill out the scenes
they only occasionally describe.
</P>
<P>
   Subtle changes in tone also clarify the jumps Carey makes in
time and place, switching from one woman's funeral to that same
woman's youth. In addition, the separate voices allow readers to
move between narratives without confusing characters, despite the
lack of conventional transitions (beyond chapter titles). This
distinction is necessary, because for all the similarity of their
basic experiences, these women live in very different worlds and
cope with different mores, all of which is conveyed in nuance of
language, in the way they talk about sex and sin, their men, and
their families of origin. And from their diverse worldviews _ that
of a young single mother hoping to save her daughter from a similar
fate, and later another mother, wanting to free her daughter to
view men as she only learned to do with difficulty _ come their
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Laid out so plainly, their tragedies are obvious, and Carey's
time-jumping serves to juxtapose their individual crises, allowing
us the tease of knowing at that moment what others do not learn
till later. That the young author can tie her tales together at the
end with some kind of resolution should not be a surprise; in that
way, this first novel is true to its genre. But that Carey does so
without losing any of the novel's emotional resonance is a tribute
to her ear and eye for detail and her courage to be honest.

   What do men want? Women tend to think the answer is pretty
obvious. Sure, they want that, but they want a lot of other things,
too. Tight triceps. Pizza for breakfast. A cream linen suit.
Glowing skin. A boss who's not insane. The perfect chicken
marinade.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, men want a lot of the same things women do, if some of the
current new-look men's magazines are anything to go by. Still,
after spending an afternoon with several of these publications _
digesting stories about the ups and downs of rock climbing, how to
beat bad breath, choosing the perfect pair of loafers to wear with
that cream linen suit (socks are optional) _ I am left with the
lingering impression that the thing men want most of all is summed
up in the headline of a story in the June issue of Men's Health:
``Live to 90 (and die having sex).'' Not that there's anything
wrong with that.
</P>
<P>
   This story is illustrated with a photograph of ``Banana George''
Blair _ who still does snowboarding and barefoot water-skiing at
age 83 _ surrounded by a half dozen bikini-clad babes. The writer,
George Kita, has rounded up some tips for aging well, among them a
warning that the biggest health threat of all is stupidity. If
true, this means readers of both men's and women's magazines may be
in more danger than they realize.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's unfair to judge either sex by the content of the
popular magazines they read. (I'd like to think that, anyway,
because on my desk is the June issue of Redbook, which features a
cover story titled ``23 Ways to Make Him Insane With Desire.'')
When Men's Health was launched, many people assumed it would expire
quickly because men simply wouldn't buy a magazine that ran the
kind of stories that women's magazines have been spinning into gold
for years, stories like ``Strip Away Fat! See Results in 9 Days''
and ``The 10 Most Common Summer Clothing Mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   But here it is, almost 10 years later, and Men's Health is
making money hand over fist with stories like the two above, both
in the June issue. The success of Men's Health has spawned half a
dozen new men's magazines and forced older monthlies like Esquire
and GQ to expand their coverage of fashion and grooming, to run
more advice columns and service stories.
</P>
<P>
   Men are only human, after all, and as baby-boom boys are dragged
reluctantly toward middle-aged manhood, they're as hungry as their
female counterparts for information about how to tighten their abs,
rid their faces of wrinkles, and punch up their sex lives, to say
nothing of how to locate the ideal barbecue grill.
</P>
<P>
   The new (and the revamped) men's magazines range over some of
the same territory, but in different ways. Understanding and
communicating with the opposite sex is a never-ending source of
material, just as it is for women's magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The June Men's Health features a story titled ``Sex: What Women
Want.'' The July issue of Men's Fitness has one titled ``Sex:
Insider Secrets to Keep 'em Coming Back.'' Both stories are written
by women. While they appear to be about the same subject, they're
quite different. The Men's Health piece is an exhaustively
anatomical description of the sex act from a woman's point of view.
By contrast, the Men's Fitness piece is a lighthearted guide about
what not to do when courting a woman: ``When she says, `I'm getting
fat,' respond with `Why don't you join my gym?''
</P>
<P>
   If it were human, Maxim would be the kind of guy you're drawn to
against your better judgment because he's so ... different. One of
the newer men's magazines, Maxim promises everything, to wit:
``Sex, Sports, Beer, Gadgets, Clothes, Fitness.'' It's what you
might get if you crossed Playboy with the Fortean Times. A
first-person piece by a guy who was almost eaten by an alligator.
Suggestions from a woman columnist on how to arrange a menage a
trois. Step-by-step instructions on how to deliver a baby. Food.
Fashion. Drinks. Sexy photos of more-or-less fully clothed women.
The June issue asks 31 women to review men's pickup lines. Do men
really have to be told, ``Don't ramble on like a bore''? Or ``It
makes me uncomfortable if a guy comments on my body in any way''?
Sadly, yes. Some men, anyway, have to be told.
</P>
<P>
   Men's Journal and Esquire are the most manly of these men's
magazines, i.e. the least like women's magazines. Still, they have
their moments. Kurt Vonnegut explains summer lust in the June/July
issue of Men's Journal. It's a very short piece. Men's Journal
readers seem to have a limited amount of time to read about sex
since they're so busy surfing, mountain climbing, biking, kayaking,
diving, etc., and worrying about what to wear when doing, or not
doing, all of the above (``There's just something about navy that
seems natural around water ...'').
</P>
<P>
   This issue of Men's Journal is so stuffed with ads and articles
about gear, gadgets, and clothes that you might think you were
reading Vogue, except that in Men's Journal fashion runs to wet
suits and tackle bags.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot about fashion, but remarkably little about sex, in
Esquire's June issue, unless you count this quote from the wine
column: ``I was reeling from a bad love affair with pinot noir and
fell into the arms of Rhone wines.'' Esquire has been
``re-energized,'' or so I read somewhere, and it shows in the
``brothers'' issue, the one with the remaining sons of Robert F.
Kennedy on the cover. It has some good stories on that close male
bond, including a fascinating piece by Tom Junod, ``One Too Many,''
about a man who murders his twin brother.
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to compare the June Esquire with the June GQ,
which drools, photographically if not editorially, over 17-year-old
cover girl Martina Hingis. GQ is fatter and glossier than any of
the other men's magazines, a tribute to its winning combination of
fashion, food, drink, travel, and titillating journalism. In this
issue there's a chilling piece on the murder of a mail-order bride,
another on cheerleading (``Rah! Booty-Shaking at Louisville U.'').
</P>
<P>
   What does the GQ man want? I turn to the magazine's advice
column, GQ&AMP;A. ``What's the lowdown on wearing sandals?'' asks B.D.
of Gary, Ind. Where have I seen this question before? Vogue?
Glamour?
</P>
<P>
   I pick up the June issue of Details. ``I never know how long to
wear my necktie,'' a reader agonizes to Glenn O'Brien, the
magazine's ``Style Guy'' advice columnist. Another wants to know:
``I just purchased my first suit. Should I leave those little tags
on the sleeve or are they meant to be taken off?''
</P>
<P>
   Oh dear. Details is supposed to be so young, so cutting edge. It
has a lot of attitude, certainly. But these questions make one
wonder what's on some of its readers' minds. ``I've read that
circumcised men are 33 percent more likely to receive oral sex,''
another reader writes. ``Would it be risky for me to consider going
under the knife?''
</P>
<P>
   Where did he read that, I wonder? In some other men's magazine?

MOSQUITO REPELLENTS BUZZ INTO SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever think your overhead smash in tennis would kill a mosquito?
It could if you used the ``Racquet Zapper,'' a $13 battery-powered
racquet made by Chicago Model International in Lake Bluff, Ill.,
that promises to electrocute mosquitos on contact with its charged
strings.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a mosquito-repellent bracelet is your weapon of choice.
New to the market is the $4 ``insect-repelling wristband,'' made by
Repello Products in Mineola, N.Y., with its ``timed vapor release''
feature.
</P>
<P>
   As Americans head into summer, there's a multitude of new
products on store shelves designed to kill or repel those pesky
creatures that suck our blood and make us itch.
</P>
<P>
   But before you throw money at these new devices, you may want to
know that mosquito specialists say the best protection comes from
applying a chemical-based repellent directly to your skin or
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Mitchell, chief of Massachusetts' pesticide bureau, said
it's safe and most effective to use a cream or spray containing the
active ingredient, N-N-diethyl-meta-toluamide, also known as DEET.
He recommends, however, that consumers use cream on their exposed
skin and spray clothing before wearing DEET to avoid breathing the
substance.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said federal rules now prohibit manufacturers from
claiming their DEET products are child-safe. He said there's no way
to determine how much will be applied or absorbed by someone's skin
at any given time, so firms can no longer advertise their products
as particularly safe for children.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Mitchell said he isn't enthusiastic about these new brands
that mix sunscreen with mosquito repellent. Though DEET is proven
to be safe and there have been only 20 reported cases worldwide of
a major allergic reaction to the chemical, Mitchell said people,
especially children, shouldn't have these chemicals on their skin
unless there's a need.
</P>
<P>
   To help figure out how best to combat mosquitos, here are some
basic facts to help you know your enemy.
</P>
<P>
   _The role of human smell: It's a mystery, but mosquitos are
attracted to a combination of carbon dioxide, which we breathe out,
and some unknown smells from humans and other mammals. For reasons
that elude scientists, some people are more attractive to mosquitos
than others.
</P>
<P>
   Most repellents mask the human smell, which is what the
DEET-containing lotions and sprays do well. Products like mosquito
coils and citronella candles, often used outdoors, aren't generally
that effective because the repellent odors become too diffuse, said
John Smith of the Norfolk (Mass.) County Mosquito Control Project.
</P>
<P>
   _City mosquitos prey around midnight: While there are dozens of
species of mosquitos, in urban areas, the overwhelming majority of
mosquitos are the Culex pipiens breed that feeds at night,
generally between midnight and 2 a.m. If you live in the suburbs,
you have more species to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   If you have an annoying wake-up call from a mosquito, you must
kill it or it will find you. Mosquitos can bite through sheets and
clothing. It will probably feed just once, so you could let it bite
you (or your bed mate) and go back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   _Mosquitos tend to fly below 8 feet or so: Most mosquitos that
annoy humans can't fly much higher than six or eight feet. So, if
you live on a higher floor, you are less likely to be exposed to
mosquitos, unless you bring them in from outside.
</P>
<P>
   _Keep the area around your home dry: Female mosquitos lay their
eggs slightly above water level. Any stagnant water in your
backyard, even in a glass jar, can serve as a home to mosquito
eggs. Once there's a rainfall, the water level rises and the water
helps the eggs hatch.
</P>
<P>
   For some interesting but less practical trivia, we learned that
only female mosquitos suck human blood and males are only good for
procreation. Females usually bite humans only once in their adult
lifetime, which lasts about one week. With the blood, they proceed
to lay eggs, anywhere from 60 to 400.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months ago, we wrote about local residents with
Asian and Hispanic surnames who were irked that they were pitched
directly in a foreign language, even when they spoke English and
didn't speak a word of their ancestor's tongue.
</P>
<P>
   These assumptions are now extending to other groups. A Globe
reporter who is second-generation Polish American, Gregg Krupa,
last month received a mailing from Sprint that promoted low rates
to Poland. The letter started, ``We know how important it is to
keep in touch with the people you care about back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Krupa said he keeps in touch with no relatives in Poland. He
doesn't speak Polish, but he did figure out how to say one thing in
Polish to Sprint officials: ``Dziekuje Nie'' (No, thanks.)

REVISITING THE TWIN TOWERS OF MODERNISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LONDON _ Although Eugene O'Neill often hailed Henrik Ibsen as
one of his primary influences, they are not often seen as kindred
spirits. A pair of justifiably acclaimed productions here of two of
their less frequently produced classics _ the Almeida Theatre's
brilliant staging of ``The Iceman
</P>
<P>
   Cometh'' and the Royal National Theatre's radical retake on
Ibsen's ``An Enemy of the People'' _ certainly offer their share of
contrasts.
</P>
<P>
   There is O'Neill's depressive isolation vs. Ibsen's more
activist, political sensibility. In these productions there are
even opposite acting styles that nevertheless result in two
superlative performances: by Kevin Spacey in ``The Iceman'' and by
Ian McKellen as ``The Enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   But to see them back to back offers more cogent lessons in their
similarities than in their differences. These two loving,
provocative productions make it obvious that the playwrights are
twin towers of modernism. Ibsen and O'Neill come to different
conclusions at the end of their long day's journeys into night
(``Iceman'' is 4 1/2 hours, ``Enemy'' a mere three), but they fight
a similar battle along the way. Namely, how is it possible to live
a life with meaning and values when an honest examination of the
world leads us to despair that meaning and values are illusion? The
unexamined life may not be worth living, but in contemporary times
the examined life might result in jumping off the fire escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iceman Cometh'' opens in a seedy bar where the denizens,
in various stages of physical and psychological disarray, are
slumbering from the previous evening's collective drunk. All except
Larry Slade, the ``recovered'' alcoholic who now casts a sober,
cynical eye over his barmates' besottedness. The elongated stage
but intimate Almeida setting practically invites us to come upstage
and throw our lot in with the guys. (Some dolls will be along
later.)
</P>
<P>
   We also share their restlessness as we wonder what all the
yammering in this pit of inertia is about. We share their
excitement when, an hour into the play, the eagerly awaited
Hickey/Spacey bursts into the bar. We want to share their cheer at
the jolt of electricity that goes through the building, not from
the People-magazine thrill of having a celebrity onstage, but from
the sense we're about to be delivered from drabness.
</P>
<P>
   That's immediately what Hickey promises us _ deliverance. He has
given up drink because he has found peace without it and he is
going to share his secret with his pals. As Spacey speeds his way
through the lines, he's an existentialist evangelist, promising to
get everyone off his bar stool and back into the world. He's no
temperance convert, he tells us, with religious-right snake oil,
but he's here to tell us to forget about tomorrow being another
day. That's the lie. The cure is to act now.
</P>
<P>
   But that's merely what he seems to be saying. We know from that
famous look in Spacey's eye that shoots charismatic daggers that
he's promising nothing so free of danger as ``get up, stand up.''
What Hickey is really selling, to his friends' horror, is the idea
that everything is illusion, or ``pipe dreams,'' as Hickey calls
it, particularly the myth that things will be better tomorrow. Our
careers aren't going to take off. Love (not that there is such a
thing) isn't going to knock on our door tomorrow. Godot isn't going
to come. (``Iceman'' was staged nine years before ``Godot.'')
</P>
<P>
   After he's shattered their illusions, he asks, ``Don't you know
you're free now to be yourselves, without having to feel remorse or
guilt, or lie to yourselves about reforming tomorrow? Can't you see
there is no tomorrow now? You're rid of it forever! You've killed
it! You don't have to care a damn about anything anymore! You've
finally got the game of life licked, don't you see that?''
</P>
<P>
   They don't see it and neither do we, even though Spacey is
hammering these lines home with an intensity that makes his words
hard to deny. Still, the barmates wonder why Hickey had to ruin the
party. As we join them in rejecting the horrible freedom in the
death of illusion that Hickey, if not O'Neill, is offering, our
denial echoes those of the characters left whimpering about
tomorrow in the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Hickey can't be right. Can he?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stockmann in ``An Enemy of the People'' has to confront
different illusions, and in Christopher Hampton's translation at
the Royal National Theatre they take on a distinctly contemporary
edge. While paying tribute to Arthur Miller's earlier translation,
Hampton notes that Stockmann was more, and less, than an
anti-McCarthyite hero. He was a flawed hero with a self-righteous
streak that made his words tougher to swallow. Because of Hampton's
translation and McKellen's impeccably classical acting, Stockmann
emerges as a more human and complex character.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it's hard not to see in Hampton's translation
something of the British left's frustration with the mushy politics
of Tony Blair and, by extension, Bill Clinton. Stockmann is
fighting not only against the environmental destruction wrought by
compromise with conservative big-business interests, but with
liberal pieties concerning democracy itself.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to shake the public out of its illusions about lower
taxes being the path to a better life, glibly caring politicians,
an independent press, and the politics of compromise in general,
Stockmann becomes, like Hickey, the Cassandra who tells us what we
don't want to hear. Like Hickey, he sees that the problem is
spiritual as well as political.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one will confuse the 1,121-seat Olivier Theatre at
the National with the 300-seat Almeida, director Trevor Nunn and
Hampton plant hecklers in the audience to bring the audience more
directly into the catalytic scene where Stockmann addresses the
townspeople:
</P>
<P>
   ``All our spiritual springs are poisoned and the whole of our
society rests on the plague-infected soil of lies ... The most
dangerous enemy of truth and freedom in our midst is the solid
majority. ... The majority never has right on its side. I said
never! That's one of those social lies, which a free, intelligent
man has to rebel against. Who is it who makes up the majority of
inhabitants of any given country? The clever or the stupid? I think
that we can agree all over the world, the stupid are in a quite
frighteningly overwhelming majority. But surely to God it can't be
right that through all eternity the stupid should have dominion
over the clever!''
</P>
<P>
   Ibsen's townspeople are even more furious with Stockmann than
O'Neill's bar rats are with Hickey, and he'll pay a heavy price for
trying to lift the veil of democratic illusion and political
correctness (Hampton practically uses the term) from their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   It is wrong, though, to equate Hickey's and Stockmann's attempts
to rid their companions' lives of illusions with O'Neill and
Ibsen's attempts to do the same with their audiences, although
that's certainly part of their intention. There is the sense in
both plays that Hickey and Stockmann go too far, that their
individual tragedies are not realizing that life is impossible
without illusion and compromise. It's not clear whether Stockmann
has learned that lesson at the end of the play, when he decides
that he's going to stay and fight, even if it means standing alone.
</P>
<P>
   Standing alone is very much the pose of the modern artist as
well, and these two superb productions show us why O'Neill and
Ibsen were such masters of modernism.

REAL TARGET OF SATIRE IN `THE TRUMAN SHOW' IS US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Promotion for ``The Truman Show'' has popped up everywhere in
the past few weeks. Like most multimillion-dollar entertainment
packages, the cleverest of the big summer movies has saturated the
media and left Jim Carrey's toothy mug on billboards and television
screens and magazines across America. Hypocritical, isn't it, that
a cracked fairy tale satirizing the media age should so
triumphantly take advantage of its prey, utilizing the subtle
commercial aesthetic it so thoroughly upends?
</P>
<P>
   No, not really. While it is indeed about the ever-growing power
of television, ``The Truman Show'' is an anti-TV statement only on
the surface. The real target of this sunny movie's very dark view
of life is us, the audience, the global population of Peeping Toms
who, like one of the TV watchers in the movie, lie wrinkling unto
death in a tepid bath, clicker firmly in hand. We are the object of
the ire of ``The Truman Show,'' ire that is so cloaked in
theme-park pastels and Rockwellian banality that you could almost
overlook it, just as Truman could almost overlook his wife's
nefariously crossed fingers. It is our passivity as TV viewers, and
not the medium of TV itself, that gives ``The Truman Show'' its
biggest pause, and cause.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, TV viewers _ and not Truman _ are ultimately the
puppets in ``The Truman Show.'' The premise is that Truman is being
filmed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, on 5,000 cameras hidden
throughout his ``Leave It to Beaver'' hometown of Seahaven. He
doesn't know it, but Seahaven is a giant, biosphere-like television
studio, and his life is a show broadcast to a world of eager,
voyeuristic viewers. His best friend, his wife, his mother, they're
all actors given direction by a hidden ``televisionary'' named
Christof, a God-like puppeteer who shouts commands like ``Cue the
sun!'' Truman is so famous that the world fawns over his every
sneeze, not because he can sing or dance but simply because he's so
purely himself, lovable, fatherless Truman.
</P>
<P>
   Christof's show is a huge success, naturally, or else it would
be canceled. It airs in bars, where we see groups of drinkers
responding passionately to the tiny shifts in Truman's fate; it
airs in front of two older women clutching a Truman pillow like
teeny-boppers; it airs in Times Square. It is pacifying and
comforting, the real-time soap opera of a happy man in an idyllic,
candy-coated setting, with isolated dramatic moments like the
``death'' by drowning of his father, then the return of his father
after years of amnesia. It's the sort of reality exercise that Andy
Warhol used with more avant-garde motives in the 1960s, creating
underground films on the exceedingly mundane including ``Eat,''
``Haircut,'' and ``Sleep,'' which featured eight hours of a man
unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, director Peter Weir and screenwriter Andrew Niccol
bring their story back to the people mesmerized by the show within
``The Truman Show.'' (At moments, these viewers resemble the
gatherings in the tavern in Elton, England, when Louise Woodward
was on trial, emotionally bound round the clock to someone else's
story.) While poor Truman gradually discovers that his entire life
is fraudulent, that even the most incidental people around him are
two-faced, that all of his paranoid fears are justified, the TV
audiences sit watching the story as if it's no different from ``The
Young and the Restless.'' They're so laid-back you can't quite
accuse them of maliciousness, the kind of misguided media
engagement that Fred Schepisi abhorred in ``A Cry in the Dark,''
the story of the Lindy Chamberlain trial in Australia that became a
witch hunt. And yet their moral distance from the life that's at
stake is insidious.
</P>
<P>
   After the story of Truman ends in near catastrophe, a policeman
watching lazily says to his buddy with a haunting casualness, ``See
what else is on.''
</P>
<P>
   The hero of the movie is Truman Burbank himself, the man who
refuses to have television forced upon him. In all his schoolboy
dorkiness and dawning paranoia, Jim Carrey's Truman is a rebel for
the millennium, making his wily exit out of his massive media
victimization by pretending to be asleep. He refuses to be a
puppet, delivering the most explicit line in a script that's
ingeniously nonconfrontational, snarling at Christof, ``You never
had a camera in my head.'' At the end of the movie, when even the
monster Christof has been foiled by the natural humanity of the man
he kept in a zoo for 30 years, Truman becomes Ulysses, setting sail
from Calypso's island, turning his back on immortality, bravely
heading into he-knows-not-what.
</P>
<P>
   And who just says no to fame these days? Our cultural
temperament is marked by a dependence on the electronic validation
offered by camcorders and Web sites and tabloid talk shows. Privacy
is passe, as people like Monica Lewinsky and the purchases of their
books are pulled into the spotlight, high-tech surveillance
mechanisms more efficiently follow our movements, and entertainers
make love to the cameras. Markers of cultural exhibitionism reach
back to PBS's ``An American Family'' in the 1970s, and they extend
to MTV's ``The Real World,'' ``America's Funniest Home Videos,''
and just about anything having to do with Madonna. (Remember Warren
Beatty's caustic remarks about his then girlfriend in ``Truth or
Dare'': ``She doesn't want to be seen off-camera, much less
talk.'') The Internet makes visibility eerily accessible, enabling
people like Jennifer Ringley to transmit every moment of her daily
life over the information highway, via her JenniCAM site.
</P>
<P>
   Since it opened, ``The Truman Show'' has been compared with
``Forrest Gump,'' as both are about history and culture acting upon
innocent men. But while ``Gump'' celebrates its hero's fickleness,
making it into his source of strength, ``Truman'' tracks its hero's
journey from unknowingness into wisdom and pain. Until he discovers
that he's a media dupe, and that his existence is ridden with
product placement, Truman is not free. He is a prisoner not just of
Christof's controlling nature, but of our passivity, as we dully
aim our remote controls at him. In ``The Truman Show,'' the hero's
revolution will not be televised.

PERE UBU: THINKING PERSON'S NONTHINKING BAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Thomas, leader of the veteran self-described
``avant-garage'' band Pere Ubu, is tossed a softball. The group's
11th and latest album, ``Pennsylvania,'' is a stunner, blending a
dead-on pop sensibility and careening musical twists and turns,
irony and passion. It could be the apotheosis of modern art-rock.
Might Peru Ubu find that ever-elusive stratum, success?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' says Thomas, from his home in Hove, outside Brighton,
England.
</P>
<P>
   Which is the answer he has given to this sort of question for
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep,'' says Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   So, how does Pere Ubu _ a Cleveland-based band that anticipated
the creative burst of mid-1970s punk and new wave _ fit into
today's alt-rock world?
</P>
<P>
   ``We fit in like we always do,'' the 44-year-old singer says.
``If you mean commercially, we don't fit in: We are unsuccessful.
If you mean artistically, I suppose you'd have to say the same:
We're probably unsuccessful. I would say that only a fool would buy
our records. ... We're no good. I don't know why you bothered to
interview me. I wouldn't waste the time or the print. Nobody's
going to thank you for writing about us. If you say anything good,
nobody will believe you or they'll just ignore you. You're wasting
your time; I'm wasting my time, but, well, that's your decision.
That's OK. I'll try to help you waste your time more efficiently.''
</P>
<P>
   If he's being darkly ironic or absurdist, he doesn't let on.
Thomas is known for being quirky, cantankerous, sardonic, ornery.
Maybe he's just telling the plain truth as he sees it. Maybe every
other pop artist is a self-aggrandizing fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Thomas stays on the telephone and discusses
``Pennsylvania,'' an oddly accessible, albeit offbeat
semi-conceptual album about journeys down many a weird road. It
sounds chaotic at times _ especially at the beginning and the end _
but it's not done scattershot style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we do is plotted out,'' explains Thomas. ``I don't
know exactly the places, and how or why it was plotted out.
`Pennsylvania' really is about the space between where you are and
where you're going to. And that space in between has a lot of
really lousy roads on it and a very low speed limit.'' Modern pop
culture takes a hit, too, in ``Woolie Bullie'': ``Culture is a
weapon that's used against us/Nah, culture is a swamp of
superstition, ignorance and abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   In concert, Thomas can seem like a demented evengelical preacher
or, as critic Greil Marcus recently wrote, admiringly, ``a man
muttering in a crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   His bandmates _ guitarists Tom Hermon and Jim Jones, synthist
Robert Wheeler, bassist Michele Temple, and drummer Steve Mehlman _
all live around Cleveland. Thomas fled to London in the mid-'80s.
``I don't know why,'' he says. ``This is just where I am at the
moment, for no particular reason.'' (He adds that England is Pere
Ubu's worst market.)
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who can seem like the answer man onstage, professes
perplexity off. ``I don't understand the idea of being
accessible,'' he says, noting that writers he's talked to have
called Pere Ubu's recent work both melodic and unmelodic. ``I have
no idea what you guys are listening to. Could you try and talk
among yourselves and figure it out?'' (Thomas's resume includes a
stint as a rock critic.)
</P>
<P>
   As to accessibility, Thomas maintains, ``Nobody asks anybody
else to be accessible. If you read a book that was `accessible,'
you probably wouldn't finish it because it wouldn't be anything
(you'd want) to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has long pursued a variety of outside-Ubu projects. He's
worked with English master-of-all-trades Richard Thompson and
former Boston art-rocker Daved Hild; he's still involved with the
English duo Two Pale Boys (``Just as pale as ever,'' he says) and
will bring them over later this year to participate in a New York
performance of ``Disastrodome,'' a lectural/musical/theatrical
extravaganza Thomas recently staged in London. During this show, he
discusses the ``geography of sound.''
</P>
<P>
   It is here that Thomas gets on a roll. ``There's an internal
landscape that informs the geography that we live in,'' he says,
``and the geography that surrounds us and forms that internal
landscape, which consists of a series of sensations that are most
easily translated as sound. I call them `hieroglyphics.' They're
not verbal, they're not ideas; they are the component of human
consciousness. When you think, for instance, of your home, there's
not a series of pictures, there's not a series of ideas, there's
not a map that comes to mind. There's a sensation that you feel, a
complex sensation that you need to communicate, but you don't use
words.''
</P>
<P>
   And, the kicker: ``I don't think that I have come to the
conclusion that there is such a thing as thinking. I, for instance,
have never had a thought in my life, and nothing is very cognitive
about anything. So, where does consciousness come from? It must
come from these hieroglyphics, these complex sensations,
remembrances of intellectual ideas and visionary moments. From
these things, we pull the words when we need them. Otherwise, there
are no words.''

GOLDWATER'S LAST DAYS: FEARLESS, FUNNY UNTIL END, WIFE RECALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; ``EDITOR'S NOTE: In her first major interview since her
89-year-old husband's death May 29,'' ``Susan Goldwater talks in
detail about his final days and months''.
</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ ``You're my wife, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Goldwater was recovering from a major stroke that had
caused swelling in the frontal lobe of his brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what they tell me,'' answered Susan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if you weren't, I'd ask you to marry me anyway,'' he
replied.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1996. As his mental and physical condition deteriorated
over the following two years, he never lost his ability to come up
with a humorous twist or a gentlemanly compliment to cover the
confusions and disorientations of his stroke-induced disorder,
which goes by the name of multi-infarct dementia.
</P>
<P>
   There would be moments when he couldn't quite place Susan
immediately. But he would remember in detail conversations of 25 or
50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He spent most of those days looking out over the Phoenix skyline
from the native rock home atop a hill near 44th Street and McDonald
Drive. There, he had lived most of his adult life _ seven years of
it with Susan, his second wife.
</P>
<P>
   She was a nurse who showed up at his door one day to take his
blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Once they got to know each other, she assumed the task of
finding him a suitable woman friend his age. Playing matchmaker for
one of Arizona's crustiest characters proved too much for her
social Rolodex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what about you?'' he asked her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too young,'' she replied, not wanting to say that he was
too old.
</P>
<P>
   He looked her up and down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you're not that young,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So that was that, and they were married 2{ years later. That was
almost seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very, you know, Barry-like,'' is the best way she can describe
the man she married.
</P>
<P>
   Through most of last year, standing or sitting at the great
picture windows of his ranchlike home, he watched the construction
of Bank One Ballpark in the distance, and worried that its massive
bulk might mar the cityscape. But he loved baseball, so he let it
go.
</P>
<P>
   He built dozens of model airplanes and ships, painting them in
meticulous detail _ a skill that grew less perfect in his last
year. He knew the specifications of the planes and had flown the
real versions of most of them.
</P>
<P>
   His old photo lab had been turned into a miniature factory for
the mass production of these symbols of his highest-flying days. He
had, after all, almost single-handedly remodeled the American
military as the powerful chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He kept a busy schedule of seeing visitors and answering letters
from his command post in the living room. He went for almost daily
car rides with certified nursing assistant Joel Carey, his personal
caregiver and designated driver. They went cruising for milkshakes
and to see the sights.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got any money?'' he would ask Carey as they left.
</P>
<P>
   ``That goddamned Susan never leaves me any,'' he would quip.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never, ever got too ill to kid,'' Carey said. For much of
the past two years Goldwater used a walker. He didn't use a
wheelchair until the final few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   About six months ago, a change came over the senator and former
presidential candidate. He didn't challenge Susan and his
caregivers at every turn or want to go out for a drive as often.
One morning he didn't even want to get out of bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you giving up?'' Susan asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving up on what?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On just pushing through, being up and about and living. Some
people give up and want to die,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, no! I love life,'' he said. Susan Goldwater said that he
meant it with deep sincerity. But she believes he was making a
transition to a new place. He was doing the hard spiritual work of
preparing himself.
</P>
<P>
   He became very selective in seeing visitors, preferring to spend
time with his brother and sister and a few old friends and
political associates. His world was narrowing. He stopped going for
rides altogether, and as the months went by lost interest in
answering his mail and even in making airplanes and ships.
</P>
<P>
   The aperture of his world view _ and it had been a wide one _
closed ever more as he curled inward to a world of comfort and
loving care.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a naturally occurring part of life,'' Susan said. ``At
the beginning of life a baby wants comfort and love and nurturing.
That's what we want at the end, too. And that is what we gave to
Barry.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the caregivers really understood what Barry was doing,
there was an effort to get him up and active. They even considered
some kind of group therapy _ for about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was painful to think that he might become bedridden, so we
tried not to let that happen,'' Susan said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gillian Hamilton, who works at Hospice of the Valley,
finally suggested that they simply let the senator do as he had
always done _ whatever he wanted to do. That worked best.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Goldwater, executive director of Hospice of the Valley,
was getting a lesson in end-of-life care from another perspective.
She was developing a new awe for the energy and time it takes to
care well for someone, even someone with great resources. For
others, she realized, more needs to be done somehow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't have this round-the-clock support, I don't know
what I would have done,'' said the energetic 58-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``I'm not the average spouse of an 85-to-89-year-old _ the
average spouse would be 75 to 85 and would not be a hospice worker
with all these resources and knowledge,'' she said. ``I can
understand why depression would enter in _ why there would be
desperation and disorganization.'' The wheels were spinning in the
professional part of her mind but she hasn't a plan or solution
yet.
</P>
<P>
   During the last two months, the senator spent more time in bed.
His caregivers propped up his bedding so he could look out toward
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``His Valley,'' the family called it.
</P>
<P>
   He watched political hearings on C-SPAN and some sporting
events. In the final weeks his attention turned to shows about
nature. Often, he just observed the native landscape surrounding
his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He adapted to every new part of his life, even in these last
days,'' Susan observed. He accepted the mission ahead.
</P>
<P>
   A month or so before his death he became more articulate than he
had been in days before. She asked: ``Are you frightened about
anything coming to this point in your life?''
</P>
<P>
   He looked at her with calm surprise: ``Frightened? I don't think
I've been frightened of anything in my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   It was genuine, Susan said. ``There was no question in my mind
that he meant that. I think he was dealing with what was coming,
and I believe he knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was not frightened. I don't think he was delighted
either. He was not one of those people who is going to fold his
hands across his chest and say he's happy to go meet his Lord. That
was not who Barry was. I think he would much rather have lived.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was a realist, she continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were, say, climbing Everest, Barry would be the type to
see the storm coming and know when to tell the guys to go back down
the slope. He would want to keep climbing, but know it's time to
head down. I think he faced that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Barry was working through a lot of undefinable issues
in his own soul during the last week of his life. We watched him
when he was in bed _ he was more peaceful than he'd been in the
previous month. I think he was working things out.''
</P>
<P>
   She walked into the living room one day to see him sitting in a
well-worn leather chair silently holding the hand of his 4-year-old
step-granddaughter, Rebecca, who enjoyed helping the nurse by using
a play stethoscope to take the senator's vital signs.
</P>
<P>
   Those vital signs started on a long glide path downward in the
last week of his life, and the family gathered around. But the
89-year-old Arizonan was, to the eyes of Susan Goldwater, totally
happy and peaceful. She watched and listened closely. He was, she
believes, mentally flying over his favorite lands in northern
Arizona, or traveling those parts again with his beloved mother,
Josephine _ Arizona's pioneer nurse.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of flying over Arizona was a comfort to Susan, too.
Her favorite memories of Barry are of long plane flights with him
over the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would know every rock down there, and have stories about
it. To me, he was a part of the landscape,'' she said. And always a
stubborn part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He, of course, would have wanted to choose his last moment,
and I believe he did. I think he made a decision the morning he
died. I saw it,'' she said. ``He had been quietly winding down in
terms of his vital signs. Then his eyes opened a little and that
blue was really showing. Then he closed his eyes very tight _ the
way he made a face sometimes when he was making a decision. I
believe I saw Barry deciding to let go. I could feel his spirit
just soaring away.''
</P>
<P>
   He died shortly after sunrise May 29, on a day of unusual winds
and cool temperatures. Good tail winds, one might say, for an easy
flight north over the canyons.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks have passed.
</P>
<P>
   There are now hundreds of letters and notes in piles on the
tables of the Goldwater home. Susan and other family members have
them sorted into piles: answered, read but not answered, not read,
and letters so dear that they must be read again. Some are just
addressed to ``The Goldwater Family, Phoenix, Arizona.'' She reads
them as a comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Carey is still helping the household cope with the change.
After two years, he has become an unofficial member of the family.
On Friday he was helping Susan and her 35-year-old daughter, Samara
Hutman, sort through the letters from princes and regular guys.
Barry was both, they agreed by the stories they remember as they
sorted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; She will start returning to her duties at Hospice of the Valley
this week, having learned again things she has learned several
times before: that death is a personal experience, not a medical
event, and that death can be and should be peaceful and
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing that can't be managed at home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan will stay in that home for now. She doesn't know what she
will do with the leftover time _ the hole. But she has books to
read, she says. And letters to write. &QL;

with all these resources and knowledge,'' she said. ``I can
understand why depression would enter in _ why there would be
desperation and disorganization.'' The wheels were spinning in the
professional part of her mind but she hasn't a plan or solution
yet.
</P>
<P>
   During the last two months, the senator spent more time in bed.
His caregivers propped up his bedding so he could look out toward
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``His Valley,'' the family called it.
</P>
<P>
   He watched political hearings on C-SPAN and some sporting
events. In the final weeks his attention turned to shows about
nature. Often, he just observed the native landscape surrounding
his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He adapted to every new part of his life, even in these last
days,'' Susan observed. He accepted the mission ahead.
</P>
<P>
   A month or so before his death he became more articulate than he
had been in days before. She asked: ``Are you frightened about
anything coming to this point in your life?''
</P>
<P>
   He looked at her with calm surprise: ``Frightened? I don't think
I've been frightened of anything in my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   It was genuine, Susan said. ``There was no question in my mind
that he meant that. I think he was dealing with what was coming,
and I believe he knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was not frightened. I don't think he was delighted
either. He was not one of those people who is going to fold his
hands across his chest and say he's happy to go meet his Lord. That
was not who Barry was. I think he would much rather have lived.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was a realist, she continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were, say, climbing Everest, Barry would be the type to
see the storm coming and know when to tell the guys to go back down
the slope. He would want to keep climbing, but know it's time to
head down. I think he faced that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Barry was working through a lot of undefinable issues
in his own soul during the last week of his life. We watched him
when he was in bed _ he was more peaceful than he'd been in the
previous month. I think he was working things out.''
</P>
<P>
   She walked into the living room one day to see him sitting in a
well-worn leather chair silently holding the hand of his 4-year-old
step-granddaughter, Rebecca, who enjoyed helping the nurse by using
a play stethoscope to take the senator's vital signs.
</P>
<P>
   Those vital signs started on a long glide path downward in the
last week of his life, and the family gathered around. But the
89-year-old Arizonan was, to the eyes of Susan Goldwater, totally
happy and peaceful. She watched and listened closely. He was, she
believes, mentally flying over his favorite lands in northern
Arizona, or traveling those parts again with his beloved mother,
Josephine _ Arizona's pioneer nurse.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of flying over Arizona was a comfort to Susan, too.
Her favorite memories of Barry are of long plane flights with him
over the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would know every rock down there, and have stories about
it. To me, he was a part of the landscape,'' she said. And always a
stubborn part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He, of course, would have wanted to choose his last moment,
and I believe he did. I think he made a decision the morning he
died. I saw it,'' she said. ``He had been quietly winding down in
terms of his vital signs. Then his eyes opened a little and that
blue was really showing. Then he closed his eyes very tight _ the
way he made a face sometimes when he was making a decision. I
believe I saw Barry deciding to let go. I could feel his spirit
just soaring away.''
</P>
<P>
   He died shortly after sunrise May 29, on a day of unusual winds
and cool temperatures. Good tail winds, one might say, for an easy
flight north over the canyons.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks have passed.
</P>
<P>
   There are now hundreds of letters and notes in piles on the
tables of the Goldwater home. Susan and other family members have
them sorted into piles: answered, read but not answered, not read,
and letters so dear that they must be read again. Some are just
addressed to ``The Goldwater Family, Phoenix, Arizona.'' She reads
them as a comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Carey is still helping the household cope with the change.
After two years, he has become an unofficial member of the family.
On Friday he was helping Susan and her 35-year-old daughter, Samara
Hutman, sort through the letters from princes and regular guys.
Barry was both, they agreed by the stories they remember as they
sorted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; She will start returning to her duties at Hospice of the Valley
this week, having learned again things she has learned several
times before: that death is a personal experience, not a medical
event, and that death can be and should be peaceful and
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing that can't be managed at home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan will stay in that home for now. She doesn't know what she
will do with the leftover time _ the hole. But she has books to
read, she says. And letters to write. &QL;

GOLDWATER'S LAST DAYS: FEARLESS, FUNNY UNTIL END, WIFE RECALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ ``You're my wife, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Goldwater was recovering from a major stroke that had
caused swelling in the frontal lobe of his brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what they tell me,'' answered Susan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if you weren't, I'd ask you to marry me anyway,'' he
replied.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1996. As his mental and physical condition deteriorated
over the following two years, he never lost his ability to come up
with a humorous twist or a gentlemanly compliment to cover the
confusions and disorientations of his stroke-induced disorder,
which goes by the name of multi-infarct dementia.
</P>
<P>
   There would be moments when he couldn't quite place Susan
immediately. But he would remember in detail conversations of 25 or
50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He spent most of those days looking out over the Phoenix skyline
from the native rock home atop a hill near 44th Street and McDonald
Drive. There, he had lived most of his adult life _ seven years of
it with Susan, his second wife.
</P>
<P>
   She was a nurse who showed up at his door one day to take his
blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Once they got to know each other, she assumed the task of
finding him a suitable woman friend his age. Playing matchmaker for
one of Arizona's crustiest characters proved too much for her
social Rolodex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what about you?'' he asked her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too young,'' she replied, not wanting to say that he was
too old.
</P>
<P>
   He looked her up and down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you're not that young,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So that was that, and they were married 2{ years later. That was
almost seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very, you know, Barry-like,'' is the best way she can describe
the man she married.
</P>
<P>
   Through most of last year, standing or sitting at the great
picture windows of his ranchlike home, he watched the construction
of Bank One Ballpark in the distance, and worried that its massive
bulk might mar the cityscape. But he loved baseball, so he let it
go.
</P>
<P>
   He built dozens of model airplanes and ships, painting them in
meticulous detail _ a skill that grew less perfect in his last
year. He knew the specifications of the planes and had flown the
real versions of most of them.
</P>
<P>
   His old photo lab had been turned into a miniature factory for
the mass production of these symbols of his highest-flying days. He
had, after all, almost single-handedly remodeled the American
military as the powerful chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He kept a busy schedule of seeing visitors and answering letters
from his command post in the living room. He went for almost daily
car rides with certified nursing assistant Joel Carey, his personal
caregiver and designated driver. They went cruising for milkshakes
and to see the sights.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got any money?'' he would ask Carey as they left.
</P>
<P>
   ``That goddamned Susan never leaves me any,'' he would quip.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never, ever got too ill to kid,'' Carey said. For much of
the past two years Goldwater used a walker. He didn't use a
wheelchair until the final few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   About six months ago, a change came over the senator and former
presidential candidate. He didn't challenge Susan and his
caregivers at every turn or want to go out for a drive as often.
One morning he didn't even want to get out of bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you giving up?'' Susan asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving up on what?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On just pushing through, being up and about and living. Some
people give up and want to die,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, no! I love life,'' he said. Susan Goldwater said that he
meant it with deep sincerity. But she believes he was making a
transition to a new place. He was doing the hard spiritual work of
preparing himself.
</P>
<P>
   He became very selective in seeing visitors, preferring to spend
time with his brother and sister and a few old friends and
political associates. His world was narrowing. He stopped going for
rides altogether, and as the months went by lost interest in
answering his mail and even in making airplanes and ships.
</P>
<P>
   The aperture of his world view _ and it had been a wide one _
closed ever more as he curled inward to a world of comfort and
loving care.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a naturally occurring part of life,'' Susan said. ``At
the beginning of life a baby wants comfort and love and nurturing.
That's what we want at the end, too. And that is what we gave to
Barry.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the caregivers really understood what Barry was doing,
there was an effort to get him up and active. They even considered
some kind of group therapy _ for about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was painful to think that he might become bedridden, so we
tried not to let that happen,'' Susan said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gillian Hamilton, who works at Hospice of the Valley,
finally suggested that they simply let the senator do as he had
always done _ whatever he wanted to do. That worked best.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Goldwater, executive director of Hospice of the Valley,
was getting a lesson in end-of-life care from another perspective.
She was developing a new awe for the energy and time it takes to
care well for someone, even someone with great resources. For
others, she realized, more needs to be done somehow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't have this round-the-clock support, I don't know
what I would have done,'' said the energetic 58-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``I'm not the average spouse of an 85-to-89-year-old _ the
average spouse would be 75 to 85 and would not be a hospice worker
with all these resources and knowledge,'' she said. ``I can
understand why depression would enter in _ why there would be
desperation and disorganization.'' The wheels were spinning in the
professional part of her mind but she hasn't a plan or solution
yet.

</P>
<P>
   One day the country's favorite ``nuclear polka'' band, six guys
with a song book of more than 600 tunes, were in Los Angeles
playing a celebrity-packed party celebrating the 200th episode of
``The Simpsons'' at the behest of series creator Matt Groening.
</P>
<P>
   That weekend they were back home in North Texas_ or, rather,
playing at Coppell's Pig Fest '98, a celebration of all things
pork-related, which also included a pot-bellied pig parade and
fashion show and an ... ahem, ``pig-nic.''
</P>
<P>
   What other band would do both? What other band would be ASKED to
do both? Therein lies Brave Combo's considerable charm.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the mix of their world-music-in-a-blender sound and
just-regular-guys group personality, they're welcome everywhere
from major music festivals to New York's Lincoln Center (where
they're hosting a cha-cha night in July), to a bar near you.
</P>
<P>
   Comboworld is the home of founder (and only remaining original
member) Carl Finch, multi-instrumentalist Jeffrey Barnes,
percussionist Joe Cripps, drummer Alan Emert, bassist Cenobio
Xavier ``Bubba'' Hernandez and trumpeter Danny O'Brien. It is the
only place where ``The Hokey Pokey'' will ever be done as a rock
tune and the Rolling Stones' ``Satisfaction'' as a cha-cha, where
the late Tiny Tim was a musical collaborator and where Sandra
Bullock was recently seen dancing down front at an Austin show,
where gigs at major European rock festivals are on the same
itinerary as the Concerts in the Garden series at the Fort Worth
Botanic Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely have our own orbit,'' Cripps said one afternoon.
``We don't have any pressure to do anything _ the only thing people
expect of us is the unexpected. We're successful in what we view
success as _ we get to make a living doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' said Barnes, looking up from a National Geographic
world atlas. ``I play music I don't hate and sometimes love _ and I
get paid for it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, after more than a dozen releases, a Grammy nomination
(in 1996, for the ``Polkas for a Gloomy World'' CD) and more than
400 weddings, BC has the world pretty much on its side. The band
can play anything it wants, from traditional polkas to tangos to
rock to Greek folk songs. The group has as many gigs as band
members could ask for, between 150 and 175 per year, and they tour
Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   They have no desire to leave Denton, they say, mainly because
it's home, it's inexpensive, and it's centrally located. Moreover,
they still get such high-profile jobs as providing music for David
Byrne's 1986 film ``True Stories'' and the 1994 Olympic performance
of ice dancers Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow.
</P>
<P>
   Finch, 46, the guy who founded BC, is professionally friendly,
interrupting an interview only to talk with a Swedish booking agent
about their upcoming European tour, which includes the band's first
gig above the Arctic Circle. But this fellow who has been known to
lead a conga line of fans through a club can also settle into
serious discussions about the history of the polka and various
strains of ethnic music.
</P>
<P>
   After all, lurking under the mix 'n' match musical shenanigans
and the goofily retooled cover versions, there's always been a
point to BC's existence. And that point, says Finch, is to stop
people's preconceived notions about what is ``good music.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the mid-'70s, Finch found himself thinking long and hard
about ``value judgments and music _ how people say, `I hate opera'
or whatever. I couldn't figure out how people made that leap _ it
parallels other prejudices.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Finch was discovering polka _ from traditional
European polkas to the regional styles of South Texas and the
Midwest. In polka, he realized, he had found the perfect way to
challenge people's notions about what is or is not good music, what
they'd spend an evening listening to or run screaming away from.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the danceably kitsch value of their music wasn't
appreciated. Their first receptive audiences, in fact, were found
during their first Texas tour _ of mental hospitals. At the same
time, punk music was exploding,
</P>
<P>
   ``Punk clubs would book us and a lot of our first fans were
punks,'' Finch said. ``And once people heard us, they liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus the BC ethic was established: They would have fun, as would
those who listened to them, but they would also be serious about
it. They released a long string of CDs on Rounder, and low-paying
bar gigs gave way, increasingly, to weddings.
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Weddings allow us to do other things we want to do _ they're
lucrative,'' said Cripps. ``And they're great for bringing in new
fans. In the last couple years people will call and ask if they can
go to a wedding we're playing, just to hear us. We have to say no _
we're just the hired help. And people also ask if we need roadies
when we go to Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no _ BC doesn't have roadies, not even one guy to
do the heavy lifting. Or a manager. Or a booking agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of booking agents are used to dealing with clubs,'' said
Cripps. ``But if they had to deal with the bride's mother, they
couldn't handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   The pragmatic approach goes for the music, too. BC has always
gone its own merry musical way, the only rule being that there are
no rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't plan stuff _ it happens,'' Finch said. ``You just
never know. Someone will bring in a song, and we'll attempt it. Or
a fan will suggest something _ a guy came up and said, `Hey,
Ringo's (Starr) ``No No Song'' would be a good cha-cha.' So we did
it. And we added `Satisfaction' onto the top of it _ I liked the
idea of putting them together.''
</P>
<P>
   During the years, there have been 12 Combo members, including
five drummers. The current lineup has been in place since August,
when Emert rejoined after a year's absence.
</P>
<P>
   The major musical shift came in 1993, with the ``No, No, No Cha
Cha Cha'' CD. Previously, Combo CDs were a mix of sounds and
genres; afterward, the CDs would focus on one type of music or
theme. For instance, last year's ``Group Dance Epidemic'' was a
collection of songs designed for mass limb-shaking, such as ``The
Mexican Hat Dance'' and Van McCoy's ``The Hustle.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the truth is: Brave Combo wants a hit single.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing OK, but if we had a master plan, it would be to
have a hit and live off it forever,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have to wonder how much soul you'd have to sell for
that hit,'' said Cripps. ``I don't want it to become an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   And chances are, really, that it won't be an issue any time
soon. More than likely, BC will be mixing styles and encouraging
clubs full of noisy patrons to do the bunny hop and the cha-cha
well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Where they stop, nobody knows.

BORDER CITY'S RED-LIGHT DISTRICT YIELDS TO VIAGRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico _ Geriatric zone doesn't have the same zing
as Boys Town, but the pricey blue pill known as Viagra is popping
up in this border city's infamous red-light district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind getting the message out: Viagra works,'' a
61-year-old Texan said as he made his way out of Martha's, one of
dozens of bars lining the storied, unpaved streets of the walled
compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is effective for a very secret, private problem,'' said the
man, who would not give his name. ``It affects millions and
millions of men.''
</P>
<P>
   A red-headed Paola Montiel, who identified herself as a
prostitute, said she believed the impotence tablet already is
boosting business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some men that are so old they can hardly walk, but
they can do it,'' said Montiel, 21, who works at Tamyko's, a
towering brothel with a Japanese-style garden and pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like 82 years old, you know something happened,''
another woman chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacists across town last weekend began stocking shelves with
the first shipment of Viagra to arrive in Nuevo Laredo, which
across the Rio Grande from Laredo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   If Viagra's debut at Benavides Pharmacy was any indication, it
could be a while before the drug draws a flood of foreign tourists
hunting for inexpensive and hassle-free prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the price is slightly more than $12 per pill, said
Enrique Moreno, a pharmacist. That compares with $7 to $10 per pill
in the United States of, depending on the dosage.
</P>
<P>
   And to purchase Viagra, customers need a prescription from a
urologist, Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price could still go down. The thing is that it's a new
drug,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. analysts say as many as 40,000 prescriptions a day are
being issued for Viagra, which is manufactured by the New
York-based Pfizer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   At least 16 men have died after taking the wildly popular drug _
including seven who reportedly died during or after sex. But the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration could not establish a link
between the drug and the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA, however, warns that heart patients who take
nitroglycerin shouldn't mix their medication with the
anti-impotence drug.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Florida man, 89, was charged with attempted
murder after a woman accused him of clubbing her with a crowbar
when she refused his Viagra-induced advances.
</P>
<P>
   Due to similar concerns shared by the Mexican government, the
Viagra at Benavides is kept under lock and key in an area separate
from other medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans come and come asking for the pill, but they don't
have prescriptions, so they're not going to get it,'' a Benavides
clerk said.

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Boys Town, the Texan leaving Martha's said he had been
battling impotence for five years, and he welcomed the options
afforded by mixing Viagra with Boys Town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been married three times and divorced three times; this
place suits me. I don't want to get married again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A block away at a shop that bore no name on its front window, a
woman arranged displays of condoms, lingerie and assorted
paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be able to sell Viagra,'' she said. ``What a great
way to make money.''

THE GRRRLS OF SUMMER: A GUIDE TO THIS YEAR'S CHICK FLICKS
</HEADLINE>

.MDNM/By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not all big lizards and asteroids at the movies. It's also
the summer of ``chick flicks.''
</P>
<P>
   Time to dust off our favorite sexist term and apply it to all
those romantic summer movies with a (sexy) female lead and a
(hunky) male love interest. In other words: flicks that demand
hankies and a very tolerant date.
</P>
<P>
   Below, we've surveyed five such films that appeal to the sappy
side in all of us and flagged their consummately chick qualities.
</P>
<P>
   And remember, just because a movie doesn't have a theme song by
Bryan Adams, doesn't mean it won't make you cry.
</P>

trainer twice her age changes everything.
</P>
<P>
   Why chicks dig it: Bob in chaps!
</P>
<P>
   Best chick-flick moment: While KST's husband chats with the guys
during a slow song, she and Redford sway on the dance floor,
radiating enough steam heat to curl hair.
</P>
<P>
   Intrusive guy element: Horrific horse-and-rider/truck wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Chick accessory (something only a chick would notice): KST's

airplane pilot twice her age changes everything.
</P>
<P>

   Best chick-flick moment: As they wade through a river in the
midst of their deserted island, the childless Ford tells Heche, ``I
always wanted kids. Bunches of 'em.''
</P>

   Intrusive guy element: Fist fight with sweaty pirates carrying
machine guns; one big boat explosion.

   The chick's shtick: Fate leads a Prozac-deprived manic
depressive to Israel, France, England and, finally, to her true
soul mate. Two problems: she's engaged; he's married.

   Why chicks dig it: Most probably won't.

Texas from Chicago after her husband runs off with her best friend.

<P>
   Why chicks dig it: Harry in tight T-shirts!

<P>
   Best chick-flick moment: Connick's heavy breathing all over
Bullock's neck during a scene in which they never even kiss. Get
out!
</P>
<P>
   Intrusive guy element: None!
</P>
<P>
   Chick accessory (something only a chick would notice): Bullock's
galvanized steel lunch box-as-purse. Very grrrrl chic.

   Chick-flick overkill: Bullock's pathetic solo walk in the rain.

<P>
   Best chick-flick moment: Mulan's grandma upon seeing Shang for
the first time: ``Woo! Sign me up for the next war!''

A GRUESOME KILLING REMINDS THE LONE STAR STATE OF ITS SOUTHERN
ROOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BUD KENNEDY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody usually does much killin' in deep East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a whole lot of stealin','' said Opal Hoffman, 68, who
sleeps nights with a loaded .22 pistol at her side in her Angelina
County roadside convenience store, Buddy's Bag-&AMP;-Boogie.
</P>
<P>
   ``People out here aren't mean. Some work hard. But a lot are
always tryin' to get somethin' for nothin'.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a way of life around here. Stealin'. Robbin'. No
killin'.
</P>
<P>
   ``Till now.''
</P>
<P>
   The East Texas way of life feels a lot like the Deep South:
country music, fried catfish, prayer meetings and muggy summer heat
so thick that even the ceiling fans work only begrudgingly.
</P>
<P>
   Now East Texas has renewed another bond with the Deep South:
race killing.
</P>
<P>
   Three young whites _ two convicted burglars and a drug offender
_ now face charges of murder in the grisly death of Jasper, Texas,
resident James ``Toe'' Byrd, chained to a truck bumper by his
ankles and dragged two miles through the Piney Woods.
</P>
<P>
   An hour's drive from any interstate highway, two hours from the
nearest international airport or atrium shopping mall, Jasper is a
remote logging town
</P>
<P>
   deep in the East Texas backwoods, 25 miles from the Sabine River
bridge and Louisiana. In appearance and personality, it resembles
almost any East Texas timber town. But it would be a mistake to
stereotype Jasper as just another suffering, socially backward,
redneck retreat.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Settled in the early 19th century and drawn as one of the
original 23 Texas Republic counties, Jasper County is miles from a
state line but not miles from the South. Surrounded by tall forests
and 5-mile-wide lakes, in country settled by transplants from South
Carolina and Alabama, the town of Jasper has more in common with
Lafayette and Baton Rouge than with Lubbock. At the Wal-Mart
SuperCenter, the best-selling college T-shirts back Texas A&AMP;M and
... not the University of Texas, but Louisiana State.
</P>
<P>
   In a Texas that bills itself as a Southwestern state and a
``whole 'nother country,'' Jasper and East Texas remain part of the
mother country: the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   Quoted in the Encyclopedia of Southern Culture, writer Willie
Morris said that a Texan once told him the South divides at Conroe,
on Interstate 45, ``because west of there, the bar fights occur
indoors, and to the east they were outdoors.''
</P>
<P>
   For 70 years, Fort Worth has bragged that Tarrant County is
``where the West begins,'' and scholars have generally agreed that
Dallas is the last outpost of East Texas and the South.
</P>
<P>
   But one Southern scholar said the border is moving east.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is less Southern than ever,'' said John Shelton Reed of
Chapel Hill, N.C., a professor of sociology at the University of
North Carolina. ``Dallas is now very Western.
</P>
<P>
   ``The border is moving east. But when you look at the family
names, the religion, the accents, the food, the music, East Texas
is still definitely very Southern. The cotton country is just as
Southern as Louisiana. ... You find some atrocious race
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas' role in the South has always been a topic of debate and
denial. The state's oldest European settlements are not far from
Jasper at the old Spanish villages of Nacogdoches and San
Augustine, and for a century Texas' emotional and political heart
lay with East Texas, the Confederate States of America and the
South.
</P>
<P>
   Texans now embrace the symbols of the West: cowboys, longhorn
cattle and horses, along with an ethnically diverse culture that
includes Native Americans and the strong traditions of northern
Mexico's vaqueros.
</P>
<P>
   But just when much of Texas had nearly forgotten the South, or
at least the less savory side of its history, racism reared to life
again last week in East Texas, reportedly riding a gray
primer-paint pickup with paroled burglar Bill ``Possum'' King, 23,
at the wheel and Byrd dragging behind.
</P>
<P>
   Also charged are Lawrence Brewer, 31, a cocaine offender on
parole from Sulphur Springs in northeast Texas, and Shawn Berry,
23, King's hometown buddy and a convicted burglar on probation.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   A somber sense of heartbreak and helplessness had settled over
Jasper by midweek, partly concealed behind a gossamer curtain of
Southern gentility. White and black residents mingled on the county
jail lawn, quietly answering every question from reporters and
recommending the chicken-fried steak at Texas Charlie's, where the
lunch special sign had been replaced by another message: ``Father
in heaven, forgive us.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond earshot of their white neighbors, black residents
wondered whom they could trust in a town that is evenly integrated
but surrounded by a county that is 90 percent white.
</P>
<P>
   Racial tensions have rarely flared in Jasper, a thriving lumber
town of about 8,000 people with a growing economy, plenty of jobs
and nary a vacancy among the historic storefronts on the courthouse
square.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Mayor R.C. Horn, an African-American, presides over the City
Council, and African-American officials have led the school board
and public hospital. Jasper students consistently post some of the
highest African-American test scores in all East Texas, doubling
and even tripling the performance of their counterparts from nearby
schools.
</P>
<P>
   But in author Mary Karr's award-winning 1995 memoir, ``The
Liars' Club,'' she recalls a 1960s scene that clarifies how racial
civility in East Texas often differs from racial equality. Karr's
childhood memories are set in the Beaumont oilfield country miles
south, but her hard-drinking, story-telling father came from the
Jasper County woods.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Karr remembers how her father drank and held court
at the local American Legion hall, where the audience often
included his friend Cooter and Shug, ``the only black man ever seen
in the Legion.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooter bossed and bullied Shug, Karr wrote, ``because he's
colored. ... Cooter is also just walking the edge of telling
colored jokes. He uses `Polack' and `Aggie,' but everybody _ Shug
included _ knows that if there wasn't a black man holding down a
chair in the middle of this room they'd be (n-word) this and
(n-word) that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy says Cooter's just ignorant, never knew anybody colored
before. ... But it seems mean how nobody ever says anything back
(to Cooter) directly. Nobody says flat out, `You're just picking on
Shug because he's colored.' It seems to me like we're not supposed
to say anything about it, that it would be bad manners.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Shug became Toe Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   Silently, the people of Jasper pinned yellow ribbons to remember
Byrd. Belatedly, some talked back to their young Cooters.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Ray Baker, an African-American pastor and host of a
weekly Christian radio show, said Jasper is not as blatantly racist
as other East Texas towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen racist towns before,'' he said. ``I've lived all
over East Texas. I lived up near (an all-white town near Tyler).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to that town. Jasper isn't anything like that town.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are towns in East Texas and the South where I might not
ever want to enter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But around here, it's just part of life. Hate is part of
life.''

SCENIC ROADS IN TEXAS? NOT OFFICIALLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government picked 33 new scenic
roadways last week, and Texas got aced again. That's right. Not a
single Texas highway made the list of roads that are considered
worth a detour because of great views, historic sites or other
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Texas also missed out on the last round of designations in 1996,
when 20 roads received the Transportation Department's seal of
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Don't blame the feds. Texas didn't make the list because Texans
didn't want any part of the federal program or the federal money
that goes with it. Fierce opposition from roadside property owners
persuaded state highway officials to drop the scenic roads project
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the loudest complaints came from the Big Bend region in
far West Texas, a prime candidate for the scenic designation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizens didn't want it. They didn't want to be told what
to do, in a nutshell,'' said Michelle Conkle of the Texas
Department of Transportation. ``They were very, very, very opposed.
They spoke and we listened, and we did what they said.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the opposition seems to have stemmed from a deep
distrust of government. Opponents feared that the scenic
designation would open the door to repressive government
restrictions on land use along the route. It hasn't worked out that
way in other states.
</P>
<P>
   The scenic byways program was established by Congress in 1991 to
promote and protect roads that have special significance.
Nominations from each state are screened by a citizen panel that
includes representatives from the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   The winning nominations are divided into two categories:
All-American Roads, which are considered ``the best of the best,''
and National Scenic Byways, which offer visitors beautiful scenery
or other notable features.
</P>
<P>
   Examples of All-American Roads include the Pacific Coast Highway
in California, the Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina and the San
Juan Skyway, a 233-mile route through the mountains of southwestern
Colorado. Only 14 roads have received the All-American designation.
</P>
<P>
   More than three dozen roads have qualified as National Scenic
Byways, including a handful within an easy drive from Texas. In
Louisiana, the 180-mile Creole Nature Trail travels along the Gulf
of Mexico in southern Calcasieu and Cameron parishes. New Mexico
routes include the Billy The Kid Scenic Byway, a loop linking
Ruidoso, Hondo, Lincoln and Capitan, and the Santa Fe Trail at
Raton.
</P>
<P>
   Roads that receive the special designations qualify for federal
grants that can be used for scenic overlooks, tourist signs,
hike-and-bike paths, or basic maintenance. The six-year highway
bill that President Clinton signed last week earmarked $148 million
for scenic byways.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the federal designation, state and local officials
agree to protect the road's special qualities. How they do that is
up to local officials, not the federal government, but the feds do
want a ban on new billboards along the route.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to access to federal cash, the scenic designation
usually means increased tourism and economic development. If a
community decides that maintaining the scenic corridor is too much
trouble, it can opt out of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had complaints from any communities that are
participating in the program,'' said Sharon Hurt Davidson, a
federal transportation official. ``It's a totally voluntary
program. We would love to work with Texas if they were
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for the offer. We'll get back to you on that.

THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR: AMERICA'S COMING OF AGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One hundred years ago this week, Theodore Roosevelt's Rough
Riders, along with other volunteer military contingents, embarked
enthusiastically from Tampa Bay and were en route to Cuba and a
series of successful skirmishes known as the Spanish-American War.
Their impressive efforts and Spain's quick surrender catapulted the
United States into its 20th-century role as a world power.
</P>
<P>
   That war, officially declared by Congress on April 25, lasted
only a few weeks and was described by then-Secretary of State John
Hay as a ``splendid little war.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Persian Gulf conflict of 1991, it produced a quick,
easy victory, dramatically showcasing America's military
superiority.
</P>
<P>
   For our country, there was only brief fighting, and very little
dying, but a newfound glory that brought a sort of unifying closure
to the bloody divisiveness of the Civil War just as, almost a
century later, our one-sided routing of Iraq seemed to cure
America's national hangover from Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``splendid little war'' in the Caribbean and South China
seas did much, much more. It thrust America, almost against its
national will, into the big, complex world of global
responsibilities that we have increasingly shouldered throughout
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone reacted joyously. So fixed were House Speaker
Thomas Brackett Reed's convictions against expanding American
hegemony or assimilating Filipinos and Puerto Ricans into an
American amalgam that he resigned the speakership rather than
participate in the new roles that the Spanish-American War thrust
upon his country.
</P>
<P>
   By 1898, America was already a political inspiration, and
arguably the world's foremost industrial power. Ours was the model
for popular people's movements on every continent. And reports of
our emerging egalitarian prosperity and open opportunity were
drawing waves of immigrants, magnet-like, from stale and hopeless
cells of stratified poverty throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from the Monroe Doctrine and our pre-Civil War
flirtation with the ``Manifest Destiny'' credo, America's interests
had been largely domestic. We'd been content to mind our own
business and plow our own acres. Didn't George Washington admonish
us to beware of entangling alliances?
</P>
<P>
   Now, suddenly, with Spain's faded empire so decisively
vanquished, we emerged like a young giant upon the world stage. It
was a sort of national coming of age, with elements both awkward
and heroic.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in the style and quality of American life swept across
the scene with that war. One of those, championed by William
Randolph Hearst, was an entirely new style of journalism,
infinitely more colorful and entertaining, and certainly more
influential if lamentably less reliable.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hearst's crusading newspapers whose screaming headlines
and extravagant claims stampeded public opinion, ultimately driving
Congress into declaring war.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Procter, in his authoritative and revealing new book on
Hearst (''William Randolph Hearst, The Early Years, 1863-1910'')
shows how the flamboyant publisher used his New York Journal to
seize quick advantage of a tragic explosion to kindle nationwide
outrage and fan it into a war cry.
</P>
<P>
   The arrogant Spanish overlords of Cuba had sunk the battleship
Maine in Havana Harbor, killing 266 U.S. servicemen, asserted
Hearst immediately. By 6 a.m. the next morning, a Journal extra was
on the streets, huge headlines announcing the ship's destruction
``BY AN ENEMY'S SECRET INFERNAL MACHINE.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 20, after four days of sensationalized finger-pointing,
the Journal's bold headline claimed ``PROOF OF A SUBMARINE MINE.''
Ensuing issues featured purported quotes from underwater divers
supplying ``positive proof'' that the Spanish, in spite of their
denials, had masterminded the gory disaster. (Years later, official
examinations of the hull would speculate that the Maine had blown
up internally, probably from combustion or accidental fire in the
coal supply, setting off explosions of the adjacent ammunition
stores.)
</P>
<P>
   Hearst had been crusading to free Cuba from Spanish rule, the
goal of repeated uprisings since at least 1878. The Journal had
championed Cuban rebels, once fictionalizing a daring ``rescue'' of
a saintly young nun from a corrupt Spanish prison. Public support
was rising for the Cuba Libre cause. The sinking of the Maine was
an irresistible instrument with which to whip sentiment to a level
of frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   With a sense of high idealism, Congress adopted by joint
resolution a firm commitment to Cuban independence as its
justification for war. ``The people of the island of Cuba are and
of right ought to be free and independent,'' proclaimed Congress,
demanding that Spain relinquish power and directing President
McKinley to use armed force if necessary to achieve that end.
</P>
<P>
   Congress declared further that the United States ``hereby
disclaims any disposition of intention to exercise sovereignty,
jurisdiction, or control over said island except for pacification
thereof, and asserts its determination, when that is accomplished,
to leave the government and control of the island to its people.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work out that way. Cuban Gen. Calixto Garcia and other
revolutionaries who'd fought beside our troops to liberate the
island were cut out of the negotiations and out of governance, to
the bitter disillusionment of Cuban patriots.
</P>
<P>
   McKinley appointed an overseer, Governor General Leonard Wood,
who said that any Cuban without at least $250 represented ``a
social element unworthy'' of the ballot. ``Let him not vote.'' We
didn't yet know how a democracy could exercise world power.
</P>
<P>
   A century later, Hawaii is a state; Puerto Rico soon may be; the
Philippines are free and mostly friendly; ours is the undisputed
mantle of world preeminence. We still haven't made peace with Cuba.
Perhaps it's time.

IS THERE TOO MUCH `NEWS'? 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The World Cup soccer championship in France is
monopolizing news space in the European papers and on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Other events of second- and third-rate importance that would
normally occupy columns of newsprint and several minutes of air
time on the nightly news have gone unreported. Apparently, they are
unmissed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a huge amount of space is being devoted not only to the
matches themselves but to the minutiae surrounding them: how the
fans are behaving, the latest snarl over the distribution of
tickets and which team's supporters have done themselves up in the
wackiest costumes. In all, as much attention goes to the peripheral
happenings as to the actual contests.
</P>
<P>
   This has led some of us to ponder the following: If the news
pages can be swallowed up day after day in this fashion, could it
be that ordinarily much of the news that is solemnly reported could
safely be ignored? In other words, do we receive too much
information from the media for our own good?
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, heresy for a journalist to ask such questions.
Information, as we're constantly told, is vital to democracy, to
the right of every citizen to know about matters that are of
concern to a well-functioning society.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it's valid to ask whether these days we get so much news
that we are becoming intellectually punch drunk. Every minor
uprising in every minor country is now reported in exhausting
detail _ except when the World Cup is on _ only to disappear
entirely from the newspapers and airwaves a day or two later.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, how much do most people elsewhere need to know
about the fighting in a border dispute between Eritrea and Ethiopia
that has recently been in the news? I suspect the stark truth is
that when such events are reported on newscasts, the audience
switches off mentally, if not physically.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that readers and listeners are getting jaded
by this cascade of force-fed facts, much of which they feel they
have no need to absorb. Around-the-clock TV news channels have
become a worldwide phenomenon. The British Broadcasting Corporation
began a 24-hour service a few months ago. Out of a potential
audience of 30 million, fewer than 400,000 regularly tune in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most things don't matter at all,'' remarked Arthur Balfour, a
British prime minister early in this century, ``and nothing matters
very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Balfour has been dismissed as a cynical aristocrat _ which he
was _ for saying that. It runs against all our conventional wisdom.
But maybe, with some exceptions, he was right. At any rate, his
words are worth recalling the next time you switch on the nightly
news.

YOUNG WOMEN COMPETE FOR A CHANCE TO PLAY A GEISHA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Every 30 seconds or so, the elevator opened,
bringing another young Asian woman into the crowded lobby. With
every new arrival, 50 pairs of eyes surreptitiously darted over to
check out the competition.
</P>
<P>
   It was 10:30 Saturday morning, scene of an open casting call for
the lead role in ``Memoirs of a Geisha,'' a film to be directed by
Steven Spielberg based on the best-selling novel by Arthur Golden.
</P>
<P>
   The flyers and newspaper ads called for ``extraordinarily
beautiful'' Asian females, ages 16 to 27. The only other
specification was for someone ``who can appear Japanese and speak
English with an accent.''
</P>
<P>
   The doors to the San Francisco casting office opened at 11, and
by the end of the day, more than 100 people showed up, each wanting
a shot at stardom.
</P>
<P>
   No acting experience was required. Few had it.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Hong, 23, is studying to be an optometrist. She went to
the casting call at the urging of her parents, who saw the ad in a
Korean newspaper. With a friend along for moral support, she made
the two-hour drive from her home in Monterey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every little girl has a dream about being a movie
star,'' said Hong, neatly dressed in a cornflower-blue pantsuit.
</P>
<P>
   She did no preparation other than to read the book, which she
had been waiting to get at the library anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Memoirs of a Geisha'' is the story of a Japanese girl sold to
a geisha house in 1929 at the age of 9. It follows her into her 30s
as she learns the art of geisha _ entertaining and charming clients
through dance, music and sex _ while also falling in love.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's quite beautiful, but she's also smart and intelligent
and has the challenge of reinventing herself,'' said casting
director Laura Folger, who is in charge of the San Francisco
search.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for someone ... who has that vulnerability and
childlike quality, with a certain playfulness, but will be able to
leave that and become wiser and more mature.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a tall order, and the producers are casting a wide net to
find the perfect actress. They plan similar calls in Los Angeles
and New York, as well as in Hawaii, Canada and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are obviously talented Asian actresses, and ideally
we'll get an actress, but there's that magic with a person who's
new to the public,'' Folger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my job to look everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one applicant in San Francisco was a bit baffled by the
questions on the casting form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It asks for your bust, waist and hip measurements,'' Lisa
Nishimura said. ``Do you walk around knowing that stuff?''
</P>
<P>
   She left it blank, but included a playful photo of herself with
a friend's dog.
</P>
<P>
   Joy Osmanski, 22, a graphic designer from Sunnyvale, was one of
the few who considered herself an actress. She has performed in
plays and commercials and auditioned for ``The Spanish Prisoner,''
a film by David Mamet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever there's a chance for Asian faces to get out there,
I'm there,'' said Osmanski, who is ethnically Korean but was
adopted by an American family.

`REAL WORLD' PUTS ITS OWN INSULAR SPIN ON LIFE IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's get it over with, shall we? ``The Real World'' is as
believable as whatever planet Dennis Rodman calls home. Those with
views to the contrary are seriously deluded, or they just happen to
live in 4,500-square-foot waterfront homes where hot and cold
running commentary on the others who live there is a regular slice
of life.
</P>
<P>
   But admit it. If someone invited you to live rent free in lavish
Seattle surroundings with six other people for four-plus months,
with a side trip to, say, Nepal, would you say no?
</P>
<P>
   You might if you knew who your housemates were going to be. But
the producers of ``The Real World'' would never divulge that sort
of thing in advance. They don't even like to divulge the last names
of the cast members because, in the real world, last names are just
so much excess baggage, dude.
</P>
<P>
   Mystery, in fact, is at the heart of ``The Real World,'' and
over seven seasons its producers, Mary-Ellis Bunim and Jonathan
Murray, have become so adept at stringing along the viewer that
it's easy to dismiss the show as a load of manipulative melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   As ``reality,'' it is eminently dismissible, since every minute
that makes it on the air is distilled from about six hours of
taping. What we don't get to see on the screen, of course, is what
we really want to know. Is David really that slimy? Will Nathan get
a mind of his own? Did Irene have special training to acquire that
annoying voice? Will Janet and Lindsay ever stop talking? Is
Stephen the sensitive type or just a whiner? Is Rebecca too good to
be true?
</P>
<P>
   Tune in every Tuesday night at 10 to find out just what
Bunim/Murray want you to find out. Here are the early indications
from the sumptuous digs on Seattle's Pier 70: David Burns, Nathan
Blackburn, Janet Choi and Lindsay Brien are the ``Ins,'' Rebecca
Lord, Stephen Williams and Irene McGee are the ``Outs.'' (Irene is
so out that she left the show before taping was finished.)
</P>
<P>
   If past seasons offer any clue, these impressions may change as
MTV's little exercise in group dynamics unfolds. One thing is
certain: Observing human behavior is always a kick, orchestrated or
not. It's kind of surprising that one of the big broadcast networks
hasn't stolen the ``Real World'' idea, because as entertainment it
sure beats another boatload of funniest home videos.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle apartment that was the castmates' home from January
to May is a hedonist's holiday. Built on an actual commercial pier
jutting into Elliott Bay, it features the requisite fireplace, pool
table, spa and exercise equipment, plus a climbing wall for
climbing the walls, and a hole in the floor for, one presumes, a
little late-night squid jigging.
</P>
<P>
   With 12 surveillance cameras and microphones throughout the pad
providing an endless stream of images and sound to 15 monitors in
the control room next door, the cast members were essentially seven
little Keikos. Add to that the rail-crossing bells that go off
about every 20 minutes along Alaskan Way and the stage is set for
some real killer wails over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Still, about 15,000 people apply to be on ``The Real World'' and
its spinoff, ``Road Rules'' (for which the cast members live in a
29-foot Winnebago instead of a stationary cush-pad).
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple: a moment of fame and a semester away from
college. But, as David says when he and Nathan see the apartment
for the first time: ``Even the soap's cool. We can't lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Nathan: ``It's like looking into a candy store when you're
a little kid. I couldn't believe it. It was just Christmas all over
again, a hundred times more.''
</P>
<P>
   It is especially meaningful to them because, if you saw last
week's casting special _ don't worry, MTV repeats everything _ you
know they both come from humble beginnings and they don't see a lot
of frills at the Virginia Military Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But their having known each other for three years is a different
sort of ``Real World'' wrinkle. It immediately puts Stephen, the
only other male cast member, into a fifth-wheel funk. The immediate
bonding of Janet and Lindsay creates the same sort of alienation
for Rebecca and Irene.
</P>
<P>
   And then, when Nathan and Janet ``discover'' a discarded journal
entry that carps about a lack of diversity in the group, the seeds
of discord start sprouting. Janet and Nathan assume it was written
by Stephen, but it turns out that Nathan's own buddy, David, is the
author.
</P>
<P>
   The coincidence of this discovery is so tortured that it strains
credulity, but it's also beside the point. The manufacturing of
conflict is a hallmark of ``The Real World,'' and it hardly matters
if it's staged or not. (Nathan's girlfriend back in Virginia, who
hadn't even applied to the show, was ``considered'' for the cast at
the last minute, then rejected. The inevitable result: Tomorrow's
episode alone has enough spite-filled phone calls to last seven
seasons.)
</P>
<P>
   So, whoever comes out of this looking good is partly up to the
individual and partly up to the tape editor. Rebecca, at 19 the
youngest and seemingly most naive of the group, looks the best
after the first show because she manages to avoid conflict. What
happens as the gang goes to work at KNDD-FM and makes its
REI-sponsored trek to the Himalayas and wanders around Seattle is
the next question.
</P>
<P>
   For MTV, the answer doesn't matter. With slick production values
and physically attractive cast members, ``The Real World,''
contrived or not, appeals to the voyeur in all of us.
</P>

SALMON GET FIGHTING CHANCE ON COLUMBIA RIVER DAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WENATCHEE, Wash. _ Operators of three Columbia River dams have
agreed with the Clinton administration on a 50-year preservation
plan that may provide a model for how the Pacific Northwest goes
about saving its endangered salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The major requirement is that the dams be operated with no net
loss of salmon.
</P>
<P>
   It is the product of four years of negotiations involving
dam-owning utilities, the National Marine Fisheries Service, Indian
tribes and a key conservation group.
</P>
<P>
   The plan mandates that 91 percent of the young salmon migrating
downstream survive through each dam and reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   The Chelan and Douglas County Public Utility Districts, the
operators of the dams, will make up for any salmon mortality by
production at hatcheries, and by an ambitious program of enhancing
salmon habitat in river systems draining the east slope of the
Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is that the plan sets standards, and the federal
government leaves it to the utilities to figure out how to achieve
these goals. They know what can work best at each dam,'' said Terry
Garcia, assistant secretary of commerce for oceans and the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The habitat plan covers Rock Island, Rocky Reach and Wells dams.
The dams are owned by the two Central Washington utilities, but
supply electricity to Puget Sound Energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a single federally owned dam in the Columbia River
system that is meeting these performance standards. This is going
to be a model,'' said Lorraine Bodi of American Rivers, a
conservation group that worked on the plan.
</P>
<P>
   With freedom to tailor fish protection to their dams, Chelan and
Douglas PUD managers have tried out ideas large and small _ as can
be seen at Rocky Reach Dam north of Wenatchee.
</P>
<P>
   The reservoir above the dam has pipes and diverters for a $12.9
million, prototype fish collector. If it works, a $50 million
permanent collector will be installed to attract young salmon and
send them around the dam.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the dam's powerhouse, turbines are being redesigned to
eliminate an indentation that was pinching and cutting into young
salmon. Below the dam, nearly invisible stainless steel wires are
strung across the river.
</P>
<P>
   The cables keep away the fish-eating seagulls that usually flock
to the turbulent waters below dams on the Columbia River.
Government employees also use starter pistols and bottle rockets to
drive away predator birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the salmon that go through our turbines, 5 percent are
killed. The other 95 come out stunned and disoriented. What we are
trying to do is remove predators while fish get their bearings,''
said Dick Nason, executive director of corporate services at the
Chelan County PUD.
</P>
<P>
   The Chelan PUD discovered that thousands of young salmon were
passing alive through Rocky Reach, but disappearing in a 300-yard
stretch between the dam and two trees along the west bank. They
were providing a feast for squawfish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we did was go out and hire eight college and
high school kids at $7.50 an hour,'' said Nason. ``They fished for
eight weeks and pulled 10,000 squawfish out of the river.''
</P>
<P>
   The utility has since financed Rotary Club fish derbies, and
prevailed on the Agriculture Department to include squawfish in a
predator-control program.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the predators away is vital, as can be seen elsewhere on
the Columbia River. Birds and predator fish below Bonneville Dam
have devoured more than 20 percent of the young salmon emerging
from the outfall of the dam's second powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   South of Wenatchee, at Rock Island Dam, most young salmon go
safely down the dam's spillways. Built in 1933, Rock Island was the
first major dam on the main Columbia River, and is only half as
high as its upstream neighbor Rocky Reach.
</P>
<P>
   While the conservation plan governs dams in Central Washington,
it has wide-ranging implications around the Northwest. They
include:
</P>
<P>
   _Assured power: A big chunk of the electricity from the projects
is transmitted across the mountains. A long-term agreement and what
Garcia calls ``a no-surprises policy'' will guarantee continued
power generation at the dams.
</P>
<P>
   _All species: The plan governs all species of salmon and
steelhead, from the relatively healthy sockeye salmon runs of Lake
Osoyoos and Lake Wenatchee to the endangered spring chinook salmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The no-net-loss policy applies to spring, summer and fall
chinook, sockeye salmon, steelhead and coho salmon if the tribes
successfully re-introduce this species,'' said Bill Dobbins,
manager of the Douglas County PUD.
</P>
<P>
   _A possible model: Faced with federal listing of salmon under
the Endangered Species Act, Western Washington counties may combine
their salmon-recovery efforts into a giant urban Habitat
Conservation Plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the players can get together, write their own plan, and set
in place a degree of certainty _ while assuring survival of the
salmon, everybody can emerge as a winner,'' said Sen. Patty Murray,
D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement on the Columbia River ``represents the future of
the Endangered Species Act; this is how to achieve recovery with
flexibility,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   Each dam on the Columbia River has its own design and hydrology.
Some are more easily modified than others.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, the newest of the utilities' dams, has a unique structure
in which the power plant is located in the middle of the dam. The
spillways are on top of the turbines.
</P>
<P>
   By accident of design, it has become most fish-friendly dam on
the Columbia. The utility has installed a vertical slot in the
middle of the dam. It takes most salmon through the dam, underneath
the spillway, and deposits them downstream. A few salmon do go
through the turbines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall we figure we have a mortality rate of just 1.2 percent
of the salmon that pass through our project,'' said Robert Clubb,
the Douglas PUD's chief of environmental and regulatory services.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm and ingenuity of the two utilities has impressed
Bodi of American Rivers. As a senior federal fisheries attorney,
she crossed swords with the Chelan PUD in the mid-1980s over the
relicensing of Rock Island Dam. But after losing a legal battle
that reached the U.S. Supreme Court, the utility began to consult
its critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a decision early on to work with tribes and
conservation agencies,'' Bodi said.
</P>
<P>
   The habitat plan is to be signed June 27. Supporters hope for
the broadest possible support, with Indian tribes and American
Rivers signing along with federal agencies and the two public
utility districts. But prospects for that are clouded.
</P>
<P>
   The Yakama, Colville and Umatilla Indians helped negotiate the
agreement. But they are locked in a dispute with the National
Marine Fisheries Service over harvesting standards and hatchery
enhancement of endangered fish stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assumption is that this will be worked out before the
signing,'' Bodi said. ``I'm not so sure. If the tribes feel they
can't sign the plan, I won't sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grant County PUD, which owns Wanapum and Priest Rapids dams
on the mid-Columbia River, has backed away from the habitat plan.
``Chelan and Douglas are signing a plan that our engineering people
have advised us is virtually impossible for us to meet,'' said Don
Godard, manager of the Grant PUD.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a sweeping agreement, Godard said, the utility will
do ``a step-by-step process'' with federal fisheries managers and
Indian tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is that Chelan and Douglas have agreed to a
process, which leaves them free to decide how to meet standards,''
he added. ``In our case, we will be working with the tribes and
agencies to reach agreement on specific actions.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Sunday &UR;  &LR; help-wanted sections are any indication, a
critical shortage of qualified computer programmers has spawned a
job market so tight that companies are wooing candidates with
everything from signing bonuses to adventure retreats in exotic
locales.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the software industry says finding good help is so
troublesome, it is pushing for legislation to increase the number
of visas for immigrants with high-tech skills. This spring, the
industry scored a victory with the US Senate's approval of a
measure, but it faces a battle in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now many more jobs than qualified people to fill
them,'' said Kenneth Mokler, director of worldwide staffing for EMC
Corp. of Hopkinton, Mass., a maker of computer storage systems.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But a growing number of unemployed and underemployed older
high-tech workers tell a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Erick Andrews says he can't give his skills away. A 52-year-old
computer engineer and software developer who took a buyout from
Digital Equipment Corp. in 1990, Andrews hasn't worked since a
consulting assignment ended last July. ``I can't even find a
McJob,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Ebacher, 51, was certain she could find another
corporate job after being laid off as a computer systems manager.
After an 18-month search, Ebacher received just one offer _ for a
teaching position at Western New England College. ``I only had a
few interviews,'' she said, ``but invariably I'd find out that the
job had been filled by a younger person.''
</P>
<P>
   While US firms point to a dearth of qualified job seekers, some
academics and computer professionals on both coasts are claiming
the shortage is little more than a sham cooked up by an industry
fraught with age bias and consumed by a yen for cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, the industry would rather hire inexpensive
labor, primarily recent college graduates and foreigners who will
work longer for less pay,'' said Norman Matloff, a computer science
professor at the University of California at Davis who has studied
hiring at high-tech firms. He has found that companies hire only 2
to 5 percent of their applicants.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the American Scientists Association has drawn
up a petition against efforts to increase foreign visas.
</P>
<P>
   But the exploding software industry maintains that it is having
so much difficulty finding qualified employees _ those who possess
very specific computer skills _ that companies are raiding
competitors and stealing talented workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many companies that were used to 8 to 10 percent turnover are
now dealing with 20 to 25 percent turnover,'' said Harris N.
Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of
America, a national group representing 11,000 companies. ``There is
also a lot more focus on financial incentives, such as retention
bonuses, as a way of keeping people in these jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent industry-backed study by Virginia Polytechnic Institute
and State University concluded that there are 346,000 available
positions for computer programmers, systems analysts, computer
scientists, and computer engineers. ``The problem,'' said Miller,
``is that colleges and universities are not producing enough people
to meet that demand.''
</P>
<P>
   He notes that in the mid-1980s, 50,000 new computer science
graduates were pumped into the market yearly. As of 1995, however,
only 24,000 computer science graduates entered the market, and a
significant number of them were immigrants who later returned home,
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   But in what could shape up to be a drawn-out fight, critics
claim the industry's analysis lacks merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data that have been used to document the so-called
shortage are extremely weak data, almost useless data,'' said New
York demographer Michael Teitelbaum, former vice chairman of the US
Commission on Immigration Reform.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the General Accounting Office in March said a
government study had failed to substantiate a shortage of computer
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum says a tight labor market doesn't necessarily mean
there is a labor shortage. ``It means you must recruit better,
retrain, offer better working conditions, and work smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joyce Plotkin, president of the Massachusetts Software
Council, says the shortage is very real. ``In Massachusetts, in
1989, we had 800 companies that employed 46,000 people,'' she said.
``In 1997, we had 2,500 companies and they employed 120,000. We
have tripled in eight years. There has been tremendous growth, but
there just aren't enough skilled people out there to fill these
jobs. The situation is critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Jack Hahn of Washington, D.C., a retired engineer and
former recruiter: ``Jobs are much more focused now. Companies are
paying people for Sunday's experience, not last year's experience.
They want people who can do it all, and they want them right
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Hahn, 70, maintains that in the time it takes companies to find
the perfect employees _ sometimes months _ they could just as
easily retrain laid-off computer professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Plotkin concedes that skill-fit is a big issue. ``It is easier
for companies to hire people who have exactly what they are looking
for,'' she said. ``Some companies are so small, they don't have
people who can train.''
</P>
<P>
   The software council, along with the industry, the state, and
the federal goverment, is trying to address the problem by
retraining older workers who have been laid off.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by their inability to land lasting work, some older
workers have joined with the ITAA's opponents in slamming the idea
of a shortage. They maintain the industry's desire for young
workers and its go-go culture have forced senior computer
professionals out of the field. A 1993 survey of college alumni
showed that 20 years after graduating, only one-fifth of those who
began their careers as computer professionals were still in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In support of the argument, Matloff, the California professor,
points to recent US Census Bureau statistics showing an
unemployment rate of 17 percent for information technology workers
over age 50, compared with a scant 2 percent for all professionals
50 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Blumenstein, 55, is not surprised. Eighteen months ago, he
retired from his software engineering job so he could enjoy life
more fully. He believes the driving force behind the current debate
is that senior employees are more likely to be turned off by the
intensity and long hours that have come to characterize the techie
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked seven days a week, 12 hours a day,'' said
Blumenstein, a Massachusetts resident. ``You have to work like a
dog or there might be some young kid who wants a new BMW and will
work like a dog to get it. Before I left there were young people
who slept on futons under their desks, and they are still doing
that here in Massachusetts and in California. I really don't think
there are people my age who want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bard-Alan Finlan holds a degree in computer engineering from the
University of California at San Diego, as well as degrees in music
and theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry says it wants the most recent skills, the hot
skills, Java, for example,'' said Finlan, 43, who works as a
temporary senior technician. ``But I could learn Java within a
month. I've sent out 200 resumes over the past 15 months, but I
can't find a full-time job.''
</P>
<P>
   Finlan, who is married and has two young children, says he has
never held the title of computer engineer even though he has the
degree. His annual salary? $36,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies really don't want people, older people, with
families or obligations,'' he said. ``We can't work 60 to 80 hours
per week, and they know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Morganroth Gullette, a resident scholar at Brandeis
University, says such observations ought to serve as a wake-up call
to the industry and the nation, where, increasingly, older is
viewed as obsolete and few companies, particularly those in high
tech, are willing to pause long enough to retrain people.
</P>
<P>
   She maintains younger workers are ready and willing to put in
long hours because the work is so appealing. But as they age, that

   ORANGE, Calif. -- It's a girl, silly.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Cara-Beth Burnside repeats the line, she laughs out
loud. As the ``girl'' in question, she knows how unexpected her
performance is, or used to be. Now more and more young women are
showing the same guts on their skate-boards as the guys. And
Burnside is among the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   The line that gets her laughing again and again is in a new TV
commercial for a shoe by Vans Inc., the one with her signature
inside and a copy of her sunburst tattoo on the heel, the one she
helped design and that brings in the royalty checks.
</P>
<P>
   Art imitating life, Burnside is at first mistaken for a guy in
the ad. After all, she's got the attitude and the elevation, not to
mention the baggy clothes. Then a squad of cheerleaders realizes
he's a she and goes wild, until Burnside knocks them over with her
board in another of Vans' good-natured digs at team sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a crack-up,'' Burnside said after the shoot, which was
delayed briefly until a helmet could be found, since she's trying
to avoid a sixth concussion. ``I love hearing them yell, `Go, girl,
go.' That's not something girl skaters get to hear a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnside, the first and only female skateboarder with a shoe of
her own, is out to change all that. At skating clinics, shopping
malls, anywhere the Southern California-based Vans sends her, she
talks up girls and young women who want to ride like her, want to
be like her. Even in celebrity-jaded LA, a crowd of boys and girls
gathers to watch her stretch out midair until her body was almost
parallel to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   She is, of course, selling shoes _ more than 150,000 pairs since
they hit stores late last year. As an athlete in one of the
perilous board-riding sports _ skateboarding, snowboarding,
wakeboarding, street luge _ Burnside is suddenly big business.
She's upfront about wanting to cash in as a skateboarder and
Olympic medalist in snowboarding while her knees and elbows and
other joints last. But she's also selling acceptance in a sport
where female role models remain almost as rare as when she was a
girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been suggested that girls skateboard before,'' said
Burnside, who picked up her first board at age 11. ``But if they
promote it as too gnarly, girls won't be into it. I want to show
they can have fun and look good, too. Too many girls worry about
makeup and being popular and stuff like that instead of being
productive at something they could be good at.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnside, approaching 30 but reluctant to be more specific about
her age, knows firsthand how hard it can be for girl skaters. Until
the Vans deal came along, no matter how good she got, as a
teen-ager and then as a college student at the University of
California Davis campus, she couldn't make even a meager living
skateboarding. There were no endorsement deals, no big-stakes
competitions. So she did what any all-round athelete would do: She
switched one so-called extreme sport for another.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the avid surfer chose another board sport.
This time it was snowboarding and she had women to compete against
all the way to the Olympics. In the inaugural snowboarding
competition, Burnside rode her signature orange board to third
place in the women's half-pipe. The board, like all of her gear,
save the sunglasses supplied by yet another sponsor, was courtesy
of Burton Snowboards in Burlington, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cara-Beth's a very aggressive individual,'' Barry Dugin,
Burton's team promotions manager said of the 5-foot 3-inch
Burnside, who weighs maybe 120 pounds in her snowsuit. ``She packs
an unbelievable amount of energy into a small frame.''
</P>
<P>
   In snowboarding, Burnside has found a world of women she hopes
to replicate in skateboarding. For her it's personal, as well as
professional. While she stars in Vans competitions as well as the
Santa Fe Springs company's print and TV ads, she also chats up girl
skaters at city parks. More than a few of them know her on sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cara-Beth rules,'' said Melissa Longfellow, co-publisher of
Fresh &AMP; Tasty, a Cambridge-based snowboarding magazine for young
women with a circulation of 75,000. ``She's one of those people
who's been snowboarding for a long time and, as everyone knows,
skateboarding is a million times harder so you have to give her a
lot of credit. ... In our world, she's an icon now.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a name brand, however, can be exhausting. Burnside may
make riding the ramp look like fun, but to her it's business. She
knows her competing years are limited. These days, in fact, she's
so busy with deals and endorsements that she doesn't get to skate
or snowboard nearly as much as she'd like. She hasn't surfed once
this year, sacrilege in the Orange County town where she grew up
and still keeps her equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Stretched out in her parents' Jacuzzi the other day, a portable
phone in one hand, a pen in the other, Burnside did business the
California way: in a red bikini with matching Arnett sunglasses.
She had airline reservations to make for a competition, photo
sessions to arrange, a weekend with her niece and nephews to plan.
Sure she was in the sun. But she made clear she wasn't relaxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think you just wake up and skate, but with all these
sponsors and endorsements, it's not like that,'' said Burnside, who
does try to get in three hours a day on her skateboard, sometimes
late in the evening. ``But it's a total business thing. I want to
make a living out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The schedule includes as many as nine snowboard competitions a
year, plus her work for Vans and her other sponsors. She shows up
at some skateboarding events, shuns others when she feels women
aren't wanted. She describes a recent event in Canada as ``not
really a thing for girls. They're all for guys.'' She pauses, then
adds, ``That's changing.''
</P>
<P>
   The guys don't scare Burnside, though _ never did. She used to
play full contact football for fun and score off the boys. She
studied karate. The back of a trading card with her likeness on it
boasts that she's been known to shame the guys red with her
skateboarding tricks. She's also careful to note that she's always
in control, even when she's flying through the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that dangerous,'' insisted Burnside, who has broken
her arm and a couple fingers and spent the night in the hospital
when she whacked her head. ``I'm not into jumping out of a plane.
Anyone can do that, doesn't take much of a brain. I'm not into the
adrenaline rush. I like tricks, skills. It's not a daredevil thing
for me. It's not like I drive ridiculously fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnside is too cool for that. With a toss of her ponytail, she
says she was stoked but not stunned to find herself at the
Olympics. Even so, she is not, she says, ``an Olympic-type
athlete.'' She likes training on her own time at her own pace,
which makes the individualism of extreme sports perfectly suited
for her. The skateboard goes most everywhere with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need a coat; I don't need anyone,'' said Burnside. ``I
can go anywhere I want. I'll always skate. But I don't know how
long I can do this competitively. That's why I'm out there making
things happen while I can.''

MOSQUITO REPELLENTS BUZZ INTO SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>

 By PATRICIA WEN

<P>
   Ever think your overhead smash in tennis would kill a mosquito?
It could if you used the ``Racquet Zapper,'' a $13 battery-powered
racquet made by Chicago Model International in Lake Bluff, Ill.,
that promises to electrocute mosquitos on contact with its charged
strings.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a mosquito-repellent bracelet is your weapon of choice.
New to the market is the $4 ``insect-repelling wristband,'' made by
Repello Products in Mineola, N.Y., with its ``timed vapor release''
feature.
</P>
<P>
   As Americans head into summer, there's a multitude of new
products on store shelves designed to kill or repel those pesky
creatures that suck our blood and make us itch.
</P>
<P>
   But before you throw money at these new devices, you may want to
know that mosquito specialists say the best protection comes from
applying a chemical-based repellent directly to your skin or
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Mitchell, chief of Massachusetts' pesticide bureau, said
it's safe and most effective to use a cream or spray containing the
active ingredient, N-N-diethyl-meta-toluamide, also known as DEET.
He recommends, however, that consumers use cream on their exposed
skin and spray clothing before wearing DEET to avoid breathing the
substance.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said federal rules now prohibit manufacturers from
claiming their DEET products are child-safe. He said there's no way
to determine how much will be applied or absorbed by someone's skin
at any given time, so firms can no longer advertise their products
as particularly safe for children.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Mitchell said he isn't enthusiastic about these new brands
that mix sunscreen with mosquito repellent. Though DEET is proven
to be safe and there have been only 20 reported cases worldwide of
a major allergic reaction to the chemical, Mitchell said people,
especially children, shouldn't have these chemicals on their skin
unless there's a need.
</P>
<P>
   To help figure out how best to combat mosquitos, here are some
basic facts to help you know your enemy.
</P>
<P>
   _The role of human smell: It's a mystery, but mosquitos are
attracted to a combination of carbon dioxide, which we breathe out,
and some unknown smells from humans and other mammals. For reasons
that elude scientists, some people are more attractive to mosquitos
than others.
</P>
<P>
   Most repellents mask the human smell, which is what the
DEET-containing lotions and sprays do well. Products like mosquito
coils and citronella candles, often used outdoors, aren't generally
that effective because the repellent odors become too diffuse, said
John Smith of the Norfolk (Mass.) County Mosquito Control Project.
</P>
<P>
   _City mosquitos prey around midnight: While there are dozens of
species of mosquitos, in urban areas, the overwhelming majority of
mosquitos are the Culex pipiens breed that feeds at night,
generally between midnight and 2 a.m. If you live in the suburbs,
you have more species to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   If you have an annoying wake-up call from a mosquito, you must
kill it or it will find you. Mosquitos can bite through sheets and
clothing. It will probably feed just once, so you could let it bite
you (or your bed mate) and go back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   _Mosquitos tend to fly below 8 feet or so: Most mosquitos that
annoy humans can't fly much higher than six or eight feet. So, if
you live on a higher floor, you are less likely to be exposed to
mosquitos, unless you bring them in from outside.
</P>
<P>
   _Keep the area around your home dry: Female mosquitos lay their
eggs slightly above water level. Any stagnant water in your
backyard, even in a glass jar, can serve as a home to mosquito
eggs. Once there's a rainfall, the water level rises and the water
helps the eggs hatch.
</P>
<P>
   For some interesting but less practical trivia, we learned that
only female mosquitos suck human blood and males are only good for
procreation. Females usually bite humans only once in their adult
lifetime, which lasts about one week. With the blood, they proceed
to lay eggs, anywhere from 60 to 400.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months ago, we wrote about local residents with
Asian and Hispanic surnames who were irked that they were pitched
directly in a foreign language, even when they spoke English and
didn't speak a word of their ancestor's tongue.
</P>
<P>
   These assumptions are now extending to other groups. A Globe
reporter who is second-generation Polish American, Gregg Krupa,
last month received a mailing from Sprint that promoted low rates
to Poland. The letter started, ``We know how important it is to
keep in touch with the people you care about back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Krupa said he keeps in touch with no relatives in Poland. He
doesn't speak Polish, but he did figure out how to say one thing in
Polish to Sprint officials: ``Dziekuje Nie'' (No, thanks.)

THE TIMES ARE RIGHT FOR A REJUVENATED PEACE CORPS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Wherever American foreign policy is headed, I have
a sneaking suspicion that Dennis Robinson is going to get there
first. If we let him.
</P>
<P>
   Like 6,100 other Americans, Dennis Robinson is in the Peace
Corps. He's just back from Panama, on the front lines of one of
today's most important battles _ against the primal forces behind
slash-and-burn agriculture and the dire threat it poses to public
health, the environment and the world's ability to feed a
still-exploding population.
</P>
<P>
   His work in the countryside has involved showing farmers how to
keep a chunk of land in production, the key to stabilizing rural
life as well as the rural environment.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the Peace Corps lit Dennis Robinson's candle. He
is anything but quixotic as he discusses the pressures on the
people he has served. But he is clearly in awe at how the Peace
Corps took a kid out of a small community in Kentucky, fresh out of
college, and connected him to the world. Like 151,000 other
Americans over the past generation-plus, he is utterly transformed.
</P>
<P>
   You couldn't imagine a better choice for an important new facet
of the program _ the Crisis Corps, which is shipping experienced
volunteers into places that have suffered natural disasters or
where peace has only recently replaced chaos and violence.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a question of will but of money. More outrageously,
it's a question of a small amount of money _ maybe $45 million,
which is chicken feed next to the tens of billions in pure pork
that fattened the highway bill President Clinton signed last week.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, this is very much your father's or your
mother's Peace Corps, its well-tried concept of service chugging
along in 84 countries. But in many others, it's different, more
vital _ the fruit of director Mark Gearan's work since the
president shipped his longtime pal over there in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   It is, for example, very much a part of post-Cold War
reconstruction. From an opening wedge in Eastern Europe, it has
moved into the battered former republics of the former Soviet Union
itself _ in Ukraine, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan. Georgia is next.
</P>
<P>
   The first English teachers went to China five years ago. The
first volunteers went back to Haiti while peacekeepers were still
patrolling there in 1996. And perhaps the luckiest volunteers are
now working with schoolteachers in reborn South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Anything but a dumb pol, Gearan yanked me down the street to eat
sandwiches with a dozen just-returned volunteers, who, like Peace
Corps workers for 37 years, can make the program's case in ways
that Director No. 14 (just like No. 1, R. Sargent Shriver) can't.
</P>
<P>
   The case is easily the biggest no-brainer in Washington. After
roughly 20 flat years the time has come to take the Peace Corps to
a new level. Clinton decided in January to take it from 6,100
volunteers and $220-plus million this year to 10,000 volunteers and
$270 million in the year 2000, still well under the
15,000-volunteer peak in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   At the time there was no dissent, no argument. But within
Congress there has also been no action since. Part of it is the
general congressional dysfunction and part is the specific
dysfunction over the budget. With account juggling there could be
room within the emerging Senate appropriation, but Newt Gingrich's
House right now couldn't decide to fund the tissue in its
restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Going a bit deeper, though, modern conservatism is growing
isolationist appendages; it's much less Reagan and Bush and more
and more Pat Buchanan. It shows in a growing hostility to trade, to
international engagement, to the United Nations, and to the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The president confronts this effectively on occasion, as he did
on China last week, but he needs to do it more and more loudly.
</P>
<P>
   He has experience fighting for his domestic counterpart,
AmeriCorps. This stunning start-up _ with major business and
bipartisan support_ survives Gingrich-inspired troublemakers
because each year the president simply refuses to accept the larger
appropriation bill that includes AmeriCorps until the program is
sufficiently funded.
</P>
<P>
   A little of that spirit would help him and, more important, help
the Peace Corps.
</P>
<P>
   The times are right. Since 1994 the number of inquiries by
potential volunteers has soared by nearly 50 percent, to more than
150,000. The spirit is there in a generation that deserves more
than Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The times are also right in the world. Freedom, independence,
and market economies _ the raw material for a better, stable world
_ are in the ascendancy, and Peace Corp volunteers are democracy's
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   And the times are also right for their modern mission. Education
remains the core, as it should, but what is new is a fresh emphasis
on environmental projects and small-business and community
development.
</P>
<P>
   T.J. Jones is a sharp kid out of Rocky Mount, N.C., an
African-American in the middle of Ukraine. Among its many evils,
communism blocked the normal institutions of community life. T.J.
Jones is up to his ears helping nonprofit, service organizations
put concrete in democracy's foundation.
</P>
<P>
   For his sake, for theirs and for ours, the idea that we are not
literally throwing money at T.J. Jones is absurd.

NO, NO, NOT PAYOFFS -- PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This is a town where a power play is something
House Speaker Newt Gingrich does to rebellious Representative Bill
Paxon. This is a town where people are more concerned with red tape
than with the red line. This is a town where people think boarding
is something the president does at Andrews Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   This is one pitiful hockey town.
</P>
<P>
   And so there is something ridiculous about having this town's
team in the Stanley Cup finals, even if it is a championship fought
over by both right and left wings.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they play games in the nation's capital. Hockey just isn't
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Now if you're looking for cultural conflict, you couldn't do
better than Washington and Detroit, whose Red Wings are the
defending National Hockey League champions. Detroit, for example,
makes cars. Washington makes excuses.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty box in Washington is known as the grand jury, and
seldom does anyone spend only two minutes there.
</P>
<P>
   It is somewhat surprising that in a city where rule-making is an
actual adult occupation many of the fans don't know the rules of
this other game. They need a few pointers. They need to know there
is only oversight, not oversight hearings, in hockey. They need to
know there is a difference between a cross-check and Al Checchi,
between a conference final and a conference committee. And they
need to know there is a difference between a cheap shot and a
slapshot, though cheap shots are not unknown in hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh. In the conference championship against the Buffalo
Sabres, an apparent Capitals goal was disallowed immediately _ but
a minute later, Washington fans were still high-fiving each other
over a goal that wasn't. It was the equivalent of Redskins fans
getting rapturous over a touchdown reception ruled incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there is a core of hockey fans here. They're just
not at the Stanley Cup playoffs, which resume with Game 4 here
Tuesday night. They can't afford the tickets. Many of the
spectators are from somewhere else. Like Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   In real hockey towns _ whether Detroit, Chicago, Boston, or
Montreal _ there's a hockey culture. It includes parents who have
laced skates in zero degrees at dawn. People who know that icing
doesn't only come on a birthday cake. People who appreciate stories
about legends such as Maurice Richard, Gordie Howe, Phil Esposito,
Bobby Orr, and Wayne Gretsky.
</P>
<P>
   The principal figure in the Capitals' pantheon is Ivan Labre,
who played for the original Capitals but who is all but unknown
elsewhere in the league. Come to think of it, more people in
downtown D.C. could pick a freshman House member from Illinois out
of a lineup (where he may, in fact, belong) than could identify the
legendary Labre, who played on a Caps team that won only eight of
its 80 games.
</P>
<P>
   Here, people know Dave Bonior, the House minority whip from
Michigan. They hardly know Caps forward Peter Bondra, who scored
more goals than anyone else in the NHL over the last four seasons.
Here people know Duncan Hunter, the chairman of a House military
procurement subcommittee. They hardly know Dale Hunter, the Caps'
captain. Here people know Martin Olav Sabo, the ranking Democrat on
the House Transportation Committee. They hardly know the Caps' Olaf
Kolzig, one of the hottest goalies in the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the conference finals, the Sabres were the talk of the town
in Buffalo. The Capitals weren't even the talk of sports talk radio
in Washington. Even now, radio hosts mock hockey-mad callers,
dismissing them as ``Stanleys,'' as in, ``Get off the phone, you
Stanley,'' sort of the sports equivalent of asking a House
colleague to relinquish the balance of his time on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, President Clinton, who grew up in the hockey
hotbed of Hot Springs, Ark., showed up at MCI Center, the Capitals'
home arena. It was the first time any sitting president actually
sat through a hockey game. Well, not exactly. The leader of the
free world freed himself before the overtime period began.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, one of the events of the year is the Beanpot
Tournament, which begins on the first Monday in February among the
four college hockey teams in town: Boston College, Northeastern,
Boston University, and Harvard. In Washington, the first Monday in
February is usually when the president submits his annual budget.
You cannot buy nachos at an OMB briefing. Or yell at authority
figures.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, some Washingtonians tuned into a playoff game
on the Fox network, which has added a color flare, called the Fox
Trax, to its broadcast so that viewers may follow the puck more
easily. If the scene seemed familiar, it was only because many in
the group thought they were reliving the first night of the bombing
of Baghdad in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But grieve not if Washington fails to seize the Stanley Cup.
Life will still have meaning here. The House and the Senate have
yet to agree on the budget resolution. The funding bill for the
International Monetary Fund hasn't reached the House yet. And
midterm elections are only months away.

`REAL WORLD' PUTS ITS OWN INSULAR SPIN ON LIFE IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's get it over with, shall we? ``The Real World'' is as
believable as whatever planet Dennis Rodman calls home. Those with
views to the contrary are seriously deluded, or they just happen to
live in 4,500-square-foot waterfront homes where hot and cold
running commentary on the others who live there is a regular slice
of life.
</P>
<P>
   But admit it. If someone invited you to live rent free in lavish
Seattle surroundings with six other people for four-plus months,
with a side trip to, say, Nepal, would you say no?
</P>
<P>
   You might if you knew who your housemates were going to be. But
the producers of ``The Real World'' would never divulge that sort
of thing in advance. They don't even like to divulge the last names
of the cast members because, in the real world, last names are just
so much excess baggage, dude.
</P>
<P>
   Mystery, in fact, is at the heart of ``The Real World,'' and
over seven seasons its producers, Mary-Ellis Bunim and Jonathan
Murray, have become so adept at stringing along the viewer that
it's easy to dismiss the show as a load of manipulative melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   As ``reality,'' it is eminently dismissible, since every minute
that makes it on the air is distilled from about six hours of
taping. What we don't get to see on the screen, of course, is what
we really want to know. Is David really that slimy? Will Nathan get
a mind of his own? Did Irene have special training to acquire that
annoying voice? Will Janet and Lindsay ever stop talking? Is
Stephen the sensitive type or just a whiner? Is Rebecca too good to
be true?
</P>
<P>
   Tune in every Tuesday night at 10 to find out just what
Bunim/Murray want you to find out. Here are the early indications
from the sumptuous digs on Seattle's Pier 70: David Burns, Nathan
Blackburn, Janet Choi and Lindsay Brien are the ``Ins,'' Rebecca
Lord, Stephen Williams and Irene McGee are the ``Outs.'' (Irene is
so out that she left the show before taping was finished.)
</P>
<P>
   If past seasons offer any clue, these impressions may change as
MTV's little exercise in group dynamics unfolds. One thing is
certain: Observing human behavior is always a kick, orchestrated or
not. It's kind of surprising that one of the big broadcast networks
hasn't stolen the ``Real World'' idea, because as entertainment it
sure beats another boatload of funniest home videos.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle apartment that was the castmates' home from January
to May is a hedonist's holiday. Built on an actual commercial pier
jutting into Elliott Bay, it features the requisite fireplace, pool
table, spa and exercise equipment, plus a climbing wall for
climbing the walls, and a hole in the floor for, one presumes, a
little late-night squid jigging.
</P>
<P>
   With 12 surveillance cameras and microphones throughout the pad
providing an endless stream of images and sound to 15 monitors in
the control room next door, the cast members were essentially seven
little Keikos. Add to that the rail-crossing bells that go off
about every 20 minutes along Alaskan Way and the stage is set for
some real killer wails over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Still, about 15,000 people apply to be on ``The Real World'' and
its spinoff, ``Road Rules'' (for which the cast members live in a
29-foot Winnebago instead of a stationary cush-pad).
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple: a moment of fame and a semester away from
college. But, as David says when he and Nathan see the apartment
for the first time: ``Even the soap's cool. We can't lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Nathan: ``It's like looking into a candy store when you're
a little kid. I couldn't believe it. It was just Christmas all over
again, a hundred times more.''
</P>
<P>
   It is especially meaningful to them because, if you saw last
week's casting special _ don't worry, MTV repeats everything _ you
know they both come from humble beginnings and they don't see a lot
of frills at the Virginia Military Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But their having known each other for three years is a different
sort of ``Real World'' wrinkle. It immediately puts Stephen, the
only other male cast member, into a fifth-wheel funk. The immediate
bonding of Janet and Lindsay creates the same sort of alienation
for Rebecca and Irene.
</P>
<P>
   And then, when Nathan and Janet ``discover'' a discarded journal
entry that carps about a lack of diversity in the group, the seeds
of discord start sprouting. Janet and Nathan assume it was written
by Stephen, but it turns out that Nathan's own buddy, David, is the
author.
</P>
<P>
   The coincidence of this discovery is so tortured that it strains
credulity, but it's also beside the point. The manufacturing of
conflict is a hallmark of ``The Real World,'' and it hardly matters
if it's staged or not. (Nathan's girlfriend back in Virginia, who
hadn't even applied to the show, was ``considered'' for the cast at
the last minute, then rejected. The inevitable result: Tomorrow's
episode alone has enough spite-filled phone calls to last seven
seasons.)
</P>
<P>
   So, whoever comes out of this looking good is partly up to the
individual and partly up to the tape editor. Rebecca, at 19 the
youngest and seemingly most naive of the group, looks the best
after the first show because she manages to avoid conflict. What
happens as the gang goes to work at KNDD-FM and makes its
REI-sponsored trek to the Himalayas and wanders around Seattle is
the next question.
</P>
<P>
   For MTV, the answer doesn't matter. With slick production values
and physically attractive cast members, ``The Real World,''
contrived or not, appeals to the voyeur in all of us.
</P>

GOLDWATER'S LAST DAYS: FEARLESS, FUNNY UNTIL END, WIFE RECALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; ``EDITOR'S NOTE: In her first major interview since her
89-year-old husband's death May 29,'' ``Susan Goldwater talks in
detail about his final days and months''.
</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ ``You're my wife, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Goldwater was recovering from a major stroke that had
caused swelling in the frontal lobe of his brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what they tell me,'' answered Susan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if you weren't, I'd ask you to marry me anyway,'' he
replied.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1996. As his mental and physical condition deteriorated
over the following two years, he never lost his ability to come up
with a humorous twist or a gentlemanly compliment to cover the
confusions and disorientations of his stroke-induced disorder,
which goes by the name of multi-infarct dementia.
</P>
<P>
   There would be moments when he couldn't quite place Susan
immediately. But he would remember in detail conversations of 25 or
50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He spent most of those days looking out over the Phoenix skyline
from the native rock home atop a hill near 44th Street and McDonald
Drive. There, he had lived most of his adult life _ seven years of
it with Susan, his second wife.
</P>
<P>
   She was a nurse who showed up at his door one day to take his
blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Once they got to know each other, she assumed the task of
finding him a suitable woman friend his age. Playing matchmaker for
one of Arizona's crustiest characters proved too much for her
social Rolodex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what about you?'' he asked her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too young,'' she replied, not wanting to say that he was
too old.
</P>
<P>
   He looked her up and down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you're not that young,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So that was that, and they were married 2{ years later. That was
almost seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very, you know, Barry-like,'' is the best way she can describe
the man she married.
</P>
<P>
   Through most of last year, standing or sitting at the great
picture windows of his ranchlike home, he watched the construction
of Bank One Ballpark in the distance, and worried that its massive
bulk might mar the cityscape. But he loved baseball, so he let it
go.
</P>
<P>
   He built dozens of model airplanes and ships, painting them in
meticulous detail _ a skill that grew less perfect in his last
year. He knew the specifications of the planes and had flown the
real versions of most of them.
</P>
<P>
   His old photo lab had been turned into a miniature factory for
the mass production of these symbols of his highest-flying days. He
had, after all, almost single-handedly remodeled the American
military as the powerful chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He kept a busy schedule of seeing visitors and answering letters
from his command post in the living room. He went for almost daily
car rides with certified nursing assistant Joel Carey, his personal
caregiver and designated driver. They went cruising for milkshakes
and to see the sights.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got any money?'' he would ask Carey as they left.
</P>
<P>
   ``That goddamned Susan never leaves me any,'' he would quip.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never, ever got too ill to kid,'' Carey said. For much of
the past two years Goldwater used a walker. He didn't use a
wheelchair until the final few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   About six months ago, a change came over the senator and former
presidential candidate. He didn't challenge Susan and his
caregivers at every turn or want to go out for a drive as often.
One morning he didn't even want to get out of bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you giving up?'' Susan asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving up on what?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On just pushing through, being up and about and living. Some
people give up and want to die,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, no! I love life,'' he said. Susan Goldwater said that he
meant it with deep sincerity. But she believes he was making a
transition to a new place. He was doing the hard spiritual work of
preparing himself.
</P>
<P>
   He became very selective in seeing visitors, preferring to spend
time with his brother and sister and a few old friends and
political associates. His world was narrowing. He stopped going for
rides altogether, and as the months went by lost interest in
answering his mail and even in making airplanes and ships.
</P>
<P>
   The aperture of his world view _ and it had been a wide one _
closed ever more as he curled inward to a world of comfort and
loving care.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a naturally occurring part of life,'' Susan said. ``At
the beginning of life a baby wants comfort and love and nurturing.
That's what we want at the end, too. And that is what we gave to
Barry.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the caregivers really understood what Barry was doing,
there was an effort to get him up and active. They even considered
some kind of group therapy _ for about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was painful to think that he might become bedridden, so we
tried not to let that happen,'' Susan said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gillian Hamilton, who works at Hospice of the Valley,
finally suggested that they simply let the senator do as he had
always done _ whatever he wanted to do. That worked best.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Goldwater, executive director of Hospice of the Valley,
was getting a lesson in end-of-life care from another perspective.
She was developing a new awe for the energy and time it takes to
care well for someone, even someone with great resources. For
others, she realized, more needs to be done somehow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't have this round-the-clock support, I don't know
what I would have done,'' said the energetic 58-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``I'm not the average spouse of an 85-to-89-year-old _ the
average spouse would be 75 to 85 and would not be a hospice worker
with all these resources and knowledge,'' she said. ``I can
understand why depression would enter in _ why there would be
desperation and disorganization.'' The wheels were spinning in the
professional part of her mind but she hasn't a plan or solution
yet.
</P>
<P>
   During the last two months, the senator spent more time in bed.
His caregivers propped up his bedding so he could look out toward
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``His Valley,'' the family called it.
</P>
<P>
   He watched political hearings on C-SPAN and some sporting
events. In the final weeks his attention turned to shows about
nature. Often, he just observed the native landscape surrounding
his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He adapted to every new part of his life, even in these last
days,'' Susan observed. He accepted the mission ahead.
</P>
<P>
   A month or so before his death he became more articulate than he
had been in days before. She asked: ``Are you frightened about
anything coming to this point in your life?''
</P>
<P>
   He looked at her with calm surprise: ``Frightened? I don't think
I've been frightened of anything in my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   It was genuine, Susan said. ``There was no question in my mind
that he meant that. I think he was dealing with what was coming,
and I believe he knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was not frightened. I don't think he was delighted
either. He was not one of those people who is going to fold his
hands across his chest and say he's happy to go meet his Lord. That
was not who Barry was. I think he would much rather have lived.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was a realist, she continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were, say, climbing Everest, Barry would be the type to
see the storm coming and know when to tell the guys to go back down
the slope. He would want to keep climbing, but know it's time to
head down. I think he faced that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Barry was working through a lot of undefinable issues
in his own soul during the last week of his life. We watched him
when he was in bed _ he was more peaceful than he'd been in the
previous month. I think he was working things out.''
</P>
<P>
   She walked into the living room one day to see him sitting in a
well-worn leather chair silently holding the hand of his 4-year-old
step-granddaughter, Rebecca, who enjoyed helping the nurse by using
a play stethoscope to take the senator's vital signs.
</P>
<P>
   Those vital signs started on a long glide path downward in the
last week of his life, and the family gathered around. But the
89-year-old Arizonan was, to the eyes of Susan Goldwater, totally
happy and peaceful. She watched and listened closely. He was, she
believes, mentally flying over his favorite lands in northern
Arizona, or traveling those parts again with his beloved mother,
Josephine _ Arizona's pioneer nurse.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of flying over Arizona was a comfort to Susan, too.
Her favorite memories of Barry are of long plane flights with him
over the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would know every rock down there, and have stories about
it. To me, he was a part of the landscape,'' she said. And always a
stubborn part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He, of course, would have wanted to choose his last moment,
and I believe he did. I think he made a decision the morning he
died. I saw it,'' she said. ``He had been quietly winding down in
terms of his vital signs. Then his eyes opened a little and that
blue was really showing. Then he closed his eyes very tight _ the
way he made a face sometimes when he was making a decision. I
believe I saw Barry deciding to let go. I could feel his spirit
just soaring away.''
</P>
<P>
   He died shortly after sunrise May 29, on a day of unusual winds
and cool temperatures. Good tail winds, one might say, for an easy
flight north over the canyons.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks have passed.
</P>
<P>
   There are now hundreds of letters and notes in piles on the
tables of the Goldwater home. Susan and other family members have
them sorted into piles: answered, read but not answered, not read,
and letters so dear that they must be read again. Some are just
addressed to ``The Goldwater Family, Phoenix, Arizona.'' She reads
them as a comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Carey is still helping the household cope with the change.
After two years, he has become an unofficial member of the family.
On Friday he was helping Susan and her 35-year-old daughter, Samara
Hutman, sort through the letters from princes and regular guys.
Barry was both, they agreed by the stories they remember as they
sorted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; She will start returning to her duties at Hospice of the Valley
this week, having learned again things she has learned several
times before: that death is a personal experience, not a medical
event, and that death can be and should be peaceful and
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing that can't be managed at home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan will stay in that home for now. She doesn't know what she
will do with the leftover time _ the hole. But she has books to
read, she says. And letters to write. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ This is a town where a power play is something
House Speaker Newt Gingrich does to rebellious Representative Bill
Paxon. This is a town where people are more concerned with red tape
than with the red line. This is a town where people think boarding
is something the president does at Andrews Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   This is one pitiful hockey town.
</P>
<P>
   And so there is something ridiculous about having this town's
team in the Stanley Cup finals, even if it is a championship fought
over by both right and left wings.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they play games in the nation's capital. Hockey just isn't
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Now if you're looking for cultural conflict, you couldn't do
better than Washington and Detroit, whose Red Wings are the
defending National Hockey League champions. Detroit, for example,
makes cars. Washington makes excuses.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty box in Washington is known as the grand jury, and
seldom does anyone spend only two minutes there.
</P>
<P>
   It is somewhat surprising that in a city where rule-making is an
actual adult occupation many of the fans don't know the rules of
this other game. They need a few pointers. They need to know there
is only oversight, not oversight hearings, in hockey. They need to
know there is a difference between a cross-check and Al Checchi,
between a conference final and a conference committee. And they
need to know there is a difference between a cheap shot and a
slapshot, though cheap shots are not unknown in hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh. In the conference championship against the Buffalo
Sabres, an apparent Capitals goal was disallowed immediately _ but
a minute later, Washington fans were still high-fiving each other
over a goal that wasn't. It was the equivalent of Redskins fans
getting rapturous over a touchdown reception ruled incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there is a core of hockey fans here. They're just
not at the Stanley Cup playoffs, which resume with Game 4 here
Tuesday night. They can't afford the tickets. Many of the
spectators are from somewhere else. Like Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   In real hockey towns _ whether Detroit, Chicago, Boston, or
Montreal _ there's a hockey culture. It includes parents who have
laced skates in zero degrees at dawn. People who know that icing
doesn't only come on a birthday cake. People who appreciate stories
about legends such as Maurice Richard, Gordie Howe, Phil Esposito,
Bobby Orr, and Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   The principal figure in the Capitals' pantheon is Ivan Labre,
who played for the original Capitals but who is all but unknown
elsewhere in the league. Come to think of it, more people in
downtown D.C. could pick a freshman House member from Illinois out
of a lineup (where he may, in fact, belong) than could identify the
legendary Labre, who played on a Caps team that won only eight of
its 80 games.
</P>
<P>
   Here, people know Dave Bonior, the House minority whip from
Michigan. They hardly know Caps forward Peter Bondra, who scored
more goals than anyone else in the NHL over the last four seasons.
Here people know Duncan Hunter, the chairman of a House military
procurement subcommittee. They hardly know Dale Hunter, the Caps'
captain. Here people know Martin Olav Sabo, the ranking Democrat on
the House Transportation Committee. They hardly know the Caps' Olaf
Kolzig, one of the hottest goalies in the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the conference finals, the Sabres were the talk of the town
in Buffalo. The Capitals weren't even the talk of sports talk radio
in Washington. Even now, radio hosts mock hockey-mad callers,
dismissing them as ``Stanleys,'' as in, ``Get off the phone, you
Stanley,'' sort of the sports equivalent of asking a House
colleague to relinquish the balance of his time on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, President Clinton, who grew up in the hockey
hotbed of Hot Springs, Ark., showed up at MCI Center, the Capitals'
home arena. It was the first time any sitting president actually
sat through a hockey game. Well, not exactly. The leader of the
free world freed himself before the overtime period began.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, one of the events of the year is the Beanpot
Tournament, which begins on the first Monday in February among the
four college hockey teams in town: Boston College, Northeastern,
Boston University, and Harvard. In Washington, the first Monday in
February is usually when the president submits his annual budget.
You cannot buy nachos at an OMB briefing. Or yell at authority
figures.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, some Washingtonians tuned into a playoff game
on the Fox network, which has added a color flare, called the Fox
Trax, to its broadcast so that viewers may follow the puck more
easily. If the scene seemed familiar, it was only because many in
the group thought they were reliving the first night of the bombing
of Baghdad in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But grieve not if Washington fails to seize the Stanley Cup.
Life will still have meaning here. The House and the Senate have
yet to agree on the budget resolution. The funding bill for the
International Monetary Fund hasn't reached the House yet. And
midterm elections are only months away.

   Ten billion. It's a number that will forever be associated with
Michael Jordan, as much as his NBA championships and his scoring
titles and his MVP awards.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has had a $10 billion impact on the U.S. economy since
joining the NBA in 1984, according to an article in Fortune
magazine that was cited by virtually every media outlet in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan. Ten billion dollars. Married forever.
</P>
<P>
   Kind of reminds me of the famous stat about the TV audience for
the Oscars. Every year, we're told ``one billion viewers worldwide
tuned in for the Academy Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever questions that figure _ or at least nobody did until
earlier this year, when Buzz magazine did some digging and found
that even if the entire populations of every country that receives
the telecast were glued to the set, the number of viewers would
fall far short of the magic one billion figure _ which was
conceived by an exuberant publicist years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, so what. The myth is too strong to kill.
</P>
<P>
   We love round numbers. If the economists commissioned by Fortune
to help them estimate ``The Jordan Effect''' had come up with a
figure of, say, $9.654 billion - well, that's just not as enticing
as 10 billion, is it? Why not round it off and attract even more
free publicity for your magazine?
</P>
<P>
   I envy their savvy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to theorize about something like the total economic
impact of Air Jordan is to engage in a kind of nebular hypothesis;
it's impossible to determine an exact figure. But sifting through
the lengthy article and the charts and figures, I came across a
number of eyebrow-raising elements.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Fortune adds up the profits of 70 Jordan-related
books, his sports videos, the cologne and underwear he endorses and
the worldwide box office and video totals for his movie ``Space
Jam,'' and they come up with a figure of $701 million.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously if you were to subtract the production and marketing
cost of the movie; the salaries of hundreds of employees who make
the underwear, print the books, etc.; and the costs of publishing a
book, among other expenses, the figure would be considerably lower.
</P>
<P>
   You could do the same thing with each category _ from NBA
attendance to the value of the Bulls' franchise to TV revenues to
advertising dough, and you'd end up with a much lesser figure. But
it wouldn't be as much fun if Fortune had said Jordan's net
economic effect was something like $3 billion or even less.
</P>
<P>
   One also has to consider that some player _ or, more likely, a
number of players _ would have generated some of the money
attributed to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   If we lived in a Michael-less world (perish the thought!), Nike
would have made someone else their prime star, and Warner Brothers
would have found some other athlete to star in a movie with its
cartoon characters, the league would have sold jerseys bearing some
other player's name and number, and sportswriters would have
written books about other athletes.
</P>
<P>
   (Heck, maybe there'd be a Zippy Pippy cologne inspired by
Scottie Pippen, who knows.)
</P>
<P>
   The point is, not every one of these dollars can be attributed
solely to the Jordan factor.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the negative financial impact Jordan has wrought?
Why, earlier this month a study was released saying that workplace
chatter about the Bulls could cost the Chicago-area economy alone
more than $90 million!
</P>
<P>
   Extrapolate those figures over the years and factor in the
nationwide work stoppages that occur because of conversation about
Michael, and he's probably cost the American workplace a few
billion, easily.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention all the players who have been driven to
unemployment ... after being embarrassed on the court by MJ. And
the local eateries that don't do as well because of the presence of
Michael Jordan's Restaurant. And the sneaker companies that have
had to lay off employees after being stomped on by the Air Jordan
line.
</P>
<P>
   Oh but wait a minute. We haven't factored in the increase in
sales at bars, restaurants, liquor stores, catering businesses,
etc., that occurs every time the Bulls play.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have we included the salaries of the people on Jordan's own
payroll, the profits of his own restaurants and golf centers, the
positive effect he's had on the sport of golf, the rise in sales of
shaving cream and razor blades now that millions are emulating his
chrome dome look...
</P>
<P>
   Ouch. Brain cramp! Upon further review, I've decided the $10
billion figure provided by Fortune is exactly right.
</P>
<P>
   To the penny.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By FRAN BLINEBURY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SALT LAKE CITY _ A lone tear ran down his cheek. Or was it a single
bead of sweat?
</P>
<P>
   For Michael Jordan, both were appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   If this was, indeed, the end of the line, the conclusion to the
wild, incredible, amazing, often controversial magical mystery tour
of the Chicago Bulls and the greatest player of our time, it was a
moment for a tinge of sadness.
</P>
<P>
   If this was just another game, one of many more in which Jordan
will run and shoot and drive himself and outperform everybody else
on the court in seasons and years to come, then it was a message of
what it means for every man, even the very best, to go to work.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sinatra, he did it his way. Taking all the big shots,
making all the big plays, embracing the biggest stage as his own
personal platform.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than the Bulls winning their sixth NBA title and
Jordan scoring 45 points. It was one final, dominating minute in
which he again lifted his team and carried it to a stunning 87-86
victory over the Jazz that in 60 gripping seconds defined and
underlined his career.
</P>
<P>
   All of the talk for the past days and weeks and months had been
about where the Bulls would go from here.
</P>
<P>
   Would Jordan finally and this time permanently hang up his
designer hightops? Would Scottie Pippen, feeling unappreciated,
sign with another team as a free agent? Would coach Phil Jackson
follow up on his pledge to walk out the door? Would Weird Dennis
Rodman take his bizarre act to another locale?
</P>
<P>
   One of a kind
</P>
<P>
   So many questions. So many emotions for the players in the
locker room and the Bulls fans around the world, wondering if it
was a time to celebrate an achievement or mourn the end of an era.
</P>
<P>
   The Beatles broke up, John Lennon died and the sun continued to
shine. But the music has never been the same.
</P>
<P>
   If Jordan leaves, there will be a similar emptiness, a dark
void.
</P>
<P>
   But for a night, he simply did what he does. He was the light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael is a guy who comes through,'' Jackson said. ``He is a
real life hero.''
</P>
<P>
   He is more than an athlete for the ages. He's an artist who
fills up the entire canvas, a dramatist who knows how to write the
last act. He owned the fourth quarter, scoring 16 points, and that
hardly tells the tale.
</P>
<P>
   Two Jordan free throws with 59.2 seconds remaining, tied the
score at 83-all and set up the final curtain.
</P>
<P>
   When John Stockton nailed a 3-pointer with 41.9 seconds to go,
it was a game the Jazz could hold.
</P>
<P>
   Until Jordan ripped it from their grasp.
</P>
<P>
   It was already a night when the Lone Ranger rode without Tonto
as Pippen labored with a painfully aching back.
</P>
<P>
   Then he did more. A driving basket over the arms of Utah
defenders and the Bulls were down by just one.
</P>
<P>
   What next?
</P>
<P>
   With just 20 seconds left, Karl Malone, who scored 31 points,
tried to set up in the low blocks. Rodman was behind him. But
Jordan crept up like a cat burglar from the side. He flicked the
ball away and now the game was where he wanted it. In his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt confident when I got that ball,'' Jordan said. ``At
that point, the crowd gets quiet and the moment becomes the moment.
Things start to move slowly. You can see it unfolding. You can read
the defense and see what it's going to do. I saw it. When (Bryon)
Russell reached, I knew what I was going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He stabbed one foot and delivered a 17-foot dagger into the
teeth of the howling Delta Center crowd with 5.2 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz could go away regretting that a desperate 3-point try
by Stockton clanked off the front rim. Utah could complain about a
horrible call by referee Dick Bavetta in the second quarter that
wiped out a trey by Howard Eisley on a 24-second violation or a
non-call on a shot by Ron Harper that tied the game with 3:44 left.
Bavetta is to officiating what Barney Fife is to law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   But to cry is to diminish the valiant fight. To rant in protest
is to surrender dignity, to deny that Jordan wouldn't have done
more, found another way. He always does. He always has.
</P>
<P>
   Now the questions remain. Will he or won't he?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, that's a gut feeling that I have,'' Jordan said.
``When I walked away the first time, it was a feeling. It wasn't
something someone told me. When I came back, it was a feeling. If
and when that time comes where I've got to walk away, I hope that
no one will look at me any less. Hopefully, I've put enough
memories out there for everybody to at least have some thoughts
about what Michael Jordan did.''
</P>
<P>
   One more night, one more memory. Of blood, of sweat, maybe of
even a tear of goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan earned it all again.

WHEEL STILL SPINNING ON RESERVATION CASINOS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Nothing brings out the schizophrenia in our
government quite like gambling does.
</P>
<P>
   What that says about the people our government purports to
represent, I'm not sure. But Gov. George W. Bush's war against two
Texas Indian tribes over casino gambling on their reservations is
the latest chapter in officialdom's inconsistent _ and uneasy _
relationship with games of chance.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is seeking legal action against casinos operated by the
Tiguas in El Paso and the Kickapoos in Eagle Pass for allegedly
violating Texas' anti-gambling laws.
</P>
<P>
   He recently renewed a request to Attorney General Dan Morales
after a lawyer for the Texas Lottery Commission told him the Tiguas
were using Las Vegas-style slot machines at their casino in El
Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Two sets of laws _ federal and state _ are potentially in
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law allows Indian tribes to conduct on their
reservations the same types of games that are legal in the state in
which the reservation is located.
</P>
<P>
   Casino gambling isn't legal in Texas, a point that Bush has
repeatedly made. But the lottery is legal in this state, and
federal law, the Indians' supporters say, lumps lotteries and
casino gambling into the same classification.
</P>
<P>
   Morales was reluctant to take on the Indians. But the Tiguas
filed their own suit in federal court, arguing that the state lacks
jurisdiction over how a federally recognized Indian tribe conducts
gambling on its reservation.
</P>
<P>
   And Democratic challenger Garry Mauro stepped in to criticize
Bush. Mauro insisted the casinos were legal and an economic boon to
the tribes. He also said the state, if it cooperated with the
Indians, could be sharing revenue from the casinos.
</P>
<P>
   How this dispute will play out _ legally and politically _
remains to be seen, but this isn't the first time Bush has staked
out an anti-gambling position. He also has been leading an attack
on eight-liners, simulated slot machines operated in some bars and
truck stops.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been so outspoken against gambling that some people who
like to read presidential politics into everything the governor
does have even speculated that he views this as an issue to ride
into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush isn't the only official in Austin to oppose casinos.
Opposition in the Legislature also has been strong against them,
despite lawmakers' approval of parimutuel betting on horse and dog
races, the lottery and charitable bingo.
</P>
<P>
   There is a law on the books allowing cruise ships that offer
casino gambling to dock in Texas ports, as long as the gambling
actually takes place outside Texas waters. But those enterprises
have had some rough sailing.
</P>
<P>
   Casino gambling is viewed as undesirable, even unsavory, by many
Texans and their leaders, even by those who regularly risk their
money on lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casino gambling, for whatever reason, is looked at through a
different lens,'' said Sue Cox, director of the Texas Council on
Problem and Compulsive Gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Richards was governor when the lottery was created in 1991,
and she had to twist a lot of arms to win the necessary two-thirds
vote for legislative approval. Once it cleared the Legislature, the
proposal didn't have any trouble winning final approval from Texas
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Richards sold the lottery as an important new revenue raiser for
the state, especially for education, at a time when the state was
still recovering from a recession and facing a budget crunch.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of parimutuel wagering, who had been shut out by the
Legislature for years, used a similar argument during the darkest
days of the recession to finally break through. In a special
session in 1986, they convinced lawmakers _ who were facing deep
budget cuts and a large tax bill in an election year _ that race
track betting also could be an important source of state revenue
and a significant boost to the Texas economy.
</P>
<P>
   So far, parimutuel hasn't lived up to its promise. Many tracks
have struggled, and some have failed. But the lottery was an
immediate hit and is still contributing more than $1 billion a year
to the state treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Had Bush been governor during those tight budget periods, would
he have lobbied lawmakers to create the lottery or supported
parimutuel betting? Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   Then-Gov. Mark White demonstrated the difficulty many elected
officials have with the gambling issue. He didn't sign the
parimutuel bill but, yielding to the arguments that it was a needed
revenue raiser, he let it become law without his signature.
</P>
<P>
   And he issued a written statement, preaching against the evils
of gambling.

A HEALTHY LAWN DISCOURAGES WEEDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I am a beginning gardener and am trying to learn some of the
basics of keeping my lawn. The lawn is only 5 or 6 months old, and
we are having problems with clumps that have tall stalks that grow
quickly and look unsightly. In trying to build up our lawn, we've
been using lawn fertilizer. What do the three numbers on the
package mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: Those quick-growing, tall clumps may be a type of weed. Do
they look different from your turf grass? Dallisgrass is a
perennial weed that forms a large clump of dark green foliage and
within days of mowing sends stalks with black seeds. Crabgrass is a
warm-season annual that forms loose clumps and sends out runners.
The foliage is a lighter green and dull. You can dig such weeds
out, and the turf will fill in.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, I think it's best to strive for a healthy lawn, as
this will discourage weeds. The key steps to a healthy lawn are
aeration, proper mowing, watering and fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   I like to aerate a lawn once or twice a year by walking around
on the lawn with spiky shoes. This creates holes that help oxygen
and rain travel down into the soil. You may have seen aerator shoes
at garden centers or in catalogs. St. Augustine is best kept at a
height between 2 and 3 inches. A mulching mower will cut the grass
blades into small pieces that quickly break down, returning
nitrogen to the soil. St. Augustine needs about 2 inches of water a
week during the hot, dry summer. If it doesn't rain, water your
lawn to make up the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Fertilize after the grass has greened in the spring and is
beginning to grow. Apply a slow-release or organic product. A 3-1-2
ratio is good. This means that the fertilizer contains 3 percent by
weight of nitrogen, 1 percent phosphorus and 2 percent potassium.
Nitrogen promotes good leaf and stem growth. Phosphorus stimulates
root development, helps plants mature and encourages the production
of flowers. Potassium aids cell metabolism and encourages heat- and
cold-hardiness. Fertilize again in the fall, not to promote top
growth, but to promote good root growth during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   There are herbicides for lawn weeds. These are categorized as
pre-emergents _ applied before the weeds come up, or
post-emergents, applied after the weeds appear. St. Augustine and
Bermuda are turf grasses grown here. However, you must be careful
to select a herbicide, or weed killer, that will not kill the turf
grass. There is a limited number of herbicides that can be used on
St. Augustine. Always study the label carefully before using a
product.
</P>
<P>
   If you must, you can use a spot weed killer that contains
glyphosate to kill weeds in St. Augustine. This herbicide will
damage the turf grass around the weed, so aim carefully or you'll
have temporary brown spots.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; I have a bush/tree in my front yard that was given to me by
a former neighbor who could only tell me the plant is a native of
his homeland, Korea. I hope you can help me identify this plant and
give me some information on care and propagation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; The photos you sent are of an althea (Hibiscus syriacus), a
great, old-fashioned large shrub/small tree. This member of the
hibiscus genus and mallow family is native to eastern Asia but was
popular in Southern gardens. Also known as rose of Sharon, the
althea is deciduous, shedding its leaves during winter, leafing out
in spring, then flowering late spring to fall. Blooms may be single
or double; colors include white with maroon eye, blue and pink. The
blooms, like those of other members of this family, last but a day,
but most produce abundant flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The low-care althea endures heat, humidity, even drought once
established. It does prefer good drainage and may suffer cotton
root rot if the soil is too alkaline. Mature height is 12 feet.
This plant accepts light shade but blooms best with some sun.
Altheas flower on new wood, so prune in late winter. Root cuttings
in late spring or early summer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; We are buying a new house in a new subdivision. The lawn
and some landscaping for the front are included, but the big fenced
back yard will be bare dirt. I like the idea of using natives, so I
was considering a wildflower meadow. Could you give a few pros and
cons on that idea? How about buffalo grass? I also would like to
plant a spreading, deciduous shade tree that would grow quickly but
still have a good long life.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; A wildflower meadow would be beautiful, but this type of
project takes planning and time. And you need to keep in mind it
will be ``beautiful'' only part of the year. You would need to let
it go to seed for future returns. I am not trying to discourage
you, only trying to point out that your back yard would be
``natural'' while your front is more ``cultivated.''
</P>
<P>
   I think it would be wise to read about sowing such a meadow.
Wildseed Farms provides excellent information on growing
wildflowers. Call 800-848-0078 for a catalog with valuable
information on sowing wildflowers and cultural tips on those
flowers available. Laura Martin's The Wildflower Meadow Book (Globe
Pequot Press) and Jim Wilson's Landscaping With Wildflowers
(Houghton Mifflin, $21.95 paperback) would also be of help.
</P>
<P>
   You might start by sowing smaller areas with annual and
perennial types this fall to determine favorites and traits of
each.
</P>
<P>
   Trees that grow quickly can have weak wood and be susceptible to
wind damage. The Drummond red maple is one of the quicker growers
among the good shade trees for our area. Ours shot from 8 feet to
above a second-floor window in less than 10 years time, and spreads
30-something feet. This tree provides fairly dense shade, and only
shade-tolerant ground covers will thrive beneath the established
canopy. The red maple is a beautiful tree, however, and fall color
is often good. Life span is approximately 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The bur oak is a deciduous, long-lived tree and a fairly fast
grower, for an oak. It does well here and produces acorns up to 2
inches long. You said your back yard is large, and this is a large
tree, maturing to approximately 80 feet in height and 50 feet in
width, but, of course, it will take some years before this size is
reached.
</P>
<P>
   The swamp chestnut oak tolerates sand or gumbo and has red fall
color. It is a slow-grower, however, and has a canopy of about 45
feet at maturity.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, you might study various landscapes with natives to
learn which shade and ornamental trees, shrubs, perennials and
bulbs as well as perennial and annual wildflowers would work and
which you would like in your garden. Make lists of your favorites.
Draw a large box representative of your back yard, then sketch
curving beds around the perimeter, leaving an area near the back
door for a deck or patio and a small- to medium-size lawn, if
wanted. Decide the best place for your shade tree, then mark spots
for smaller trees and shrubs. Then, as your budget allows, you can
actually build those beds.
</P>
<P>
   Sally and Andy Wasowski's books, Native Texas Plants:
Landscaping Region by Region (Gulf Publishing, $27.95) and Native
Texas Gardens: Maximum Beauty, Minimum Upkeep (Gulf Publishing,
$39.95), will give you ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo grass adapts best in areas with low rainfall, high
sunlight and less foot traffic. Therefore, it is not commonly used
as turf grass here. I would visit a site where it exists, study its
appearance and walk on it. If you know of none, contact a grass
company and inquire. Zoysia is another type of turf grass that you
might explore.

OLD INDIA-PAKISTAN FEUD TAKES A NEW TWIST FOR KASHMIRIS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARION LLOYD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India _ The gunmen waited until the Muslim villagers
were safely at the mosque before swooping down from their mountain
hide-out and massacring 23 Hindus in their homes. Only an
11-year-old boy survived after pretending to be dead while the
assailants torched the Hindu temple next door and fled.
</P>
<P>
   The Jan. 25 massacre in Wandhama village was one of several mass
attacks this year against Hindus in the northern Indian state of
Jammu and Kashmir, where pro-Islamic militants are fighting for
independence from mainly Hindu India. But the attacks have failed
in their main objective _ to paint the struggle along religious
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, both Muslims and Hindus say it is not religion, but
rather politicians in Pakistan and India, who are to blame. And now
that both countries are declared nuclear powers, Kashmiris fear
they are caught in an increasingly perilous cross fire between the
hostile neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``India and Pakistan are greedy. They want land, not people, and
they would think nothing of dropping bombs here,'' said Gulam Ahmed
Bhat, a retired Muslim sign painter in Srinagar, the state's summer
capital. He said he was disillusioned with both countries and that
independence was the only option, a growing belief among the
residents of India's only Muslim-majority state.
</P>
<P>
   The attack in Wyndhama, just 13 miles north of Srinagar, was a
sign of the Indian government's failure to contain the violence,
which has claimed between 15,000 and 70,000 lives since Kashmiri
youths took up arms in 1989. The New Delhi government does not keep
records on civilian casualties but does on the 9,000 soldiers
killed in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over Kashmir, a third of which is controlled by
Pakistan, has been the primary source of tension between the
hostile neighbors since the subcontinent gained independence from
Britain in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the countries have fought three wars, two of them
over Kashmir, which Pakistan claims was illegally grafted onto
India at independence. But it took the demonstration of India and
Pakistan's nuclear capability to call world attention to the
troubled state.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's successful nuclear tests have intensified the
51-year dispute. The subsequent war of words between the two
fledgling nuclear powers prompted members of the United Nations
Security Council to call an emergency meeting June 4, in which they
urged a peaceful resolution of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries have expressed willingness to use nuclear weapons
to defend their territory. Kashmiris fear that pledge may extend to
their disputed homeland, making them the first victims of a
potential nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are slaves to the whims of India and Pakistan,'' said
17-year-old Adil Khan. ``But what about our lives. Does that not
mean anything?''
</P>
<P>
   The Indian government has refused to consider independence,
saying Kashmir voluntarily chose to join India and that most
residents support the status quo. Last week, India's government
rejected a proposal by the U.N. Security Council to serve as
mediators.
</P>
<P>
   But while the government has portrayed the conflict as an
attempt by Muslim extremists to impose their will on the majority,
the fighting has taken an equally harsh toll on Muslims, who have
borne the brunt of the Indian army's counterinsurgency tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fathers are being tortured by the army, and we have no
food to eat, no money to pay our school fees,'' said 12-year-old
Mushtaq Ahmed Rather, from Nagbl village outside Srinagar. He said
his father was tortured by the army, which accused him of being a
militant, and was detained for three years without trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The soldiers are always drunk, and they abuse our mothers and
our sisters,'' he charged.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, army officers barged into his brother's house at 5:30
a.m. and demanded to know where the militants were hiding. ``We
told them we don't know any militants, but they ransacked our house
and abused us,'' said Rather's sister-in-law, Ashai Kader.
</P>
<P>
   Other Muslims tell horror stories of whole families being shot
in their homes by soldiers and women being gang-raped as revenge
against militant attacks on army outposts. Many say militants are
guilty of similar atrocities, usually in revenge against Muslims
they believed have informed against them.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every family has lost a relative in the fighting, which
has caused 70,000 Hindus to flee to the southern Hindu-dominated
area of Jammu and to New Delhi, the Indian capital, since 1989.
Those who remain live in fear, and the New Delhi government has
been forced to deploy thousands of soldiers to guard the scattered
Hindu enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rich men have fled, and only the poor people have stayed
behind,'' said Jawaharlal Mathoo, a Hindu whose sister was killed
in the massacre at Wandhama. Fifteen Indian soldiers are stationed
round the clock outside his modest brick house in nearby Tulmula
village, where he earns $75 a month as a plantation supervisor for
the Indian government.
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't blame Muslims for the attack, because
``they're suffering too.''
</P>
<P>
   The fighting has devastated the economy of the Kashmir Valley, a
spectacular expanse of emerald rice fields and quaint villages
surrounded by snowcapped mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism, once the third-largest industry, has practically
stopped since the rebel movement emerged in 1989. In 1988, 722,000
tourists visited the area, famous for its scenic Himalayan treks
and woolen handicrafts. The valley was also a favorite among Bombay
filmmakers, who shot the standard pastoral dance scenes found in
Hindi films in the valley's lush fields.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 at the height of the violence, fewer than 7,000 tourists
arrived, most of them foreign. Filmmakers abandoned the valley,
choosing to pay higher prices for shooting in Switzerland. Nearly
all the hotels have been expropriated by the army for barracks and
offices, while most of the houseboat inns along Srinagar's Dal Lake
are vacant.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has improved slightly since the army began a
massive counteroffensive in 1994, chasing militants into the
mountains and rural areas. But the 10,000 tourists who visited
Kashmir last year were only a fraction of earlier arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   The government can't launch a major campaign to lure tourists
back until the danger subsides, said one tourism official who asked
to remain anonymous. But he said the government is offering
incentives for workers to renovate hotels and other facilities to
prepare for the tourists' eventual return.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a drop in violence in the mid-1990s around Srinagar, the
kidnapping of six foreign hikers in 1995 dashed hopes that the
valley was safe for tourists. The hikers, from the United States,
Britain, Norway and Germany, were abducted in three separate
incidents by what was believed to be a little known militant group.
After the Indian government refused to accede to the kidnappers'
demands to release 21 militants, the decapitated body of one of the
hostages, Norwegian Hans Christian Ostro, was found by the side of
a mountain road. The other five hostages were never released and
are believed to have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was condemned by pro-independence and pro-Pakistani
leaders, who claimed it was orchestrated by the Indian government
to discredit their movements internationally. The government denies
these claims.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pervasive violence, however, many Kashmiris remain
sympathetic to the militants, whom they claim are the lesser of two
evils.
</P>
<P>
   When an Indian soldier used a metal club to break up a crowd of
Muslim youths talking to a reporter in downtown Srinagar, one
teen-ager remarked, ``See, that's the army's attitude, and they
claim the militants are violent.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``martyrs' graveyard'' in downtown Srinagar is filled with
women weeping for their lost sons and young men, paying homage to
their heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were fighting for independence and they were right. It is
a noble cause,'' said Bilal Ahmed, a carpet salesmen whose two
militant cousins are buried in the graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed condemned the militants who had surrendered and gone over
to the government's side. He claimed the renegades had ``made a
business'' of kidnapping Muslim civilians believed to be
sympathetic to the militants.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Bebe, a Muslim woman whose militant son was killed by the
army two years ago, said she hoped ``the mission my son led will be
accomplished.'' She came to pay respects to other fallen militants,
since ``the army would not give me my son's body.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, most Kashmiris blame both sides for the violence, and
believe their best hope for peace is to become an independent
country, despite critics' claims that a small, landlocked Kashmir
could never survive between behemoths China and India, and Pakistan
to the south.
</P>
<P>
   On June 4, pro-independence groups called a strike in Srinagar
to demand that the government allow them to decide their future
status through a referendum. Protesters carried signs reading ``We
want freedom'' and hurled rocks at Indian soldiers to signal their
discontent with Indian rule.
</P>
<P>
   They want the Indian government to comply with a 1948 U.N.
resolution calling for a referendum to let the state decide whether
to align with India or Pakistan. The residents also demand a third
option of independence on the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   But few expect that their demands will be met.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 50 years they've been promising us the right to determine
our fate,'' complained sign painter Bhat. ``What's to say anything
will change now?''

&HT;    INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE UNLIKELY TO FORGE A RESOLUTION ON KASHMIR
RESOLUTION

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARION LLOYD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India _ By declaring themselves nuclear powers, India
and Pakistan have raised the stakes in their decades-old rivalry
and sent alarmed world leaders scrambling to find a solution to the
countries' prime area of conflict, the disputed Himalayan territory
of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   But it will take more than international pressure to persuade
Pakistan and India to settle their differences and bury fears of a
potential nuclear war. Although Pakistan and India swapped
proposals last week, they seemed to have difficulties finding any
common ground, and they did not agree to talk.
</P>
<P>
   India gained control of two-thirds of the formerly princely
state of Jammu and Kashmir, and left Pakistan with the remaining
third after the subcontinent split at independence in 1947. India
called the region it controlled Jammu and Kashmir, while Pakistan
named its area Kashmir. Since then, Pakistan, which claims it was
robbed of its rightful control over Muslim-majority territory, has
demanded that India comply with a 1948 United Nations resolution
calling for a referendum to decide the territory's status.
</P>
<P>
   India has refused, and on June 7 the Indian government dismissed
as interference a U.N. Security Council offer to mediate in what it
argues is a bilateral issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian government also refused to submit to U.N. pressure
that it sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in the wake of last
month's nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. It accused the world
body of bias, pointing to the fact that the U.N. session was
chaired by China, Pakistan's longtime ally and the suspected source
of its nuclear technology. China, which, since 1959, has controlled
a swath of mostly unpopulated territory in Kashmir's northeast
sector following an agreement with Pakistan, has a vested interest
in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict over the region has sparked two wars between India
and Pakistan since 1947 and claimed at least 15,000 lives since
1989, when pro-Islamic militants took up arms against the Indian
government.
</P>
<P>
   India blames Pakistan for the insurgency, saying the Pakistani
government provides arms and training for militants _ charges that
Pakistan denies. New Delhi also claims there is little mass support
for the militants' demands and that most Kashmiris want to remain
part of India.
</P>
<P>
   So why the fear of a referendum, ask pro-Pakistani and
pro-independence groups. They claim the Indian government brought
about the insurgency by refusing to grant Kashmiris the right to
self-determination, and, that if given the choice, the people would
overwhelmingly opt to secede from India. By using force to squash
resistance movements in the early 1980s, the Indian government
created the atmosphere for armed conflict, they argue. India then
exacerbated the violence by ordering the army to crush the
insurgency at any cost, critics said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government of India used violence to crush our nonviolent
resistance, so the Kashmiri youths took up guns,'' said Yasin
Malik, the former leader of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front,
the first of about a dozen militant groups to emerge in the region.
``Now they commit atrocities with the message `behave or you will
have to face this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Malik, who spent seven years in jail on conspiracy charges
before his release in 1994, has since founded a political wing of
the liberation front to push for a peaceful resolution. He claims
as many as 70,000 people have been killed in the fighting _ five
times the official figure of 15,000 _ since 1989 and argues that
independence from India and Pakistan is the only way to achieve a
lasting peace while protecting the interests of the state's diverse
religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Kashmir are by nature anti-Indian,'' said Malik.
``They will never reconcile with the side of the Indians.'' He said
he opposed joining with Pakistan, because he said they
discriminated against religious minorities. ``They believe in the
Islamic philosophy but they must learn to respect individual
values.''
</P>
<P>
   Among anti-India leaders, the pro-independence stand articulated
by Malik is dominant. But a few members of the All Parties Huriyet
Conference, the alliance of opposition parties to which he belongs,
support joining Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Sayed Shah Ali Gilani, the current chairman of the congress,
favors sticking with the original U.N. proposal for a referendum,
which did not include independence as an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the Kashmir problem is concerned, it took place by
the partition of united India, the basis for which is a two-nation
theory,'' he said. But he said that if other secessionist leaders
insisted on putting independence on the ballot, he would accept it.
</P>
<P>
   Indian loyalists claim such a vote would jeopardize the
territorial integrity of India by encouraging separatist movements
in other parts of the country, particularly in the far eastern
states, which are virtually cut off from the rest of the country.
They further argue India's accession of Kashmir was legal and that
residents have no claim toward independence.
</P>
<P>
   India would win a referendum because most Kashmiris blame
Pakistan for fueling the violence, said Javaid Shah, a former
militant leader who was granted amnesty after he renounced the
fight in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, they told us to take up arms to protect Islam and
that it was a jihad (holy war),'' said Shah, who was elected to the
state's legislative assembly last year on a platform of peace and
economic development. ``But ultimately I realized that Islam was
not in decline and that we were creating needless violence.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had firsthand knowledge that Pakistan was
funding the insurgents. ``Only if Pakistan stops providing guns and
money will the fighting stop,'' he said, adding ``the international
community has the power to make that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Moderates say both sides will have to compromise if the violence
is to be stopped. Kashmir's home minister, Ali Mohammed Sager,
argues for a return to the partial autonomy granted Jammu and
Kashmir in the early years after the territory's Hindu ruler agreed
to merge with newly independent India. The state's ``special
status'' was later revoked in 1954 with the approval of Kashmir's
pro-Indian chief minister, Bakshi Ghulam Muhammed.
</P>
<P>
   Such an arrangement would please both independence groups and
the state's Hindu minority, most of whom support remaining part of
India, Sager said. However, he acknowledged that Pakistan would
probably resist such a move, since it would mean an end to
Islamabad's hopes of seeing a united Muslim state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pakistan is not reconciling the situation, thinking wherever
there are Muslims they are a part of Pakistan,'' he said. ``They
are under the illusion that they are the rulers of the whole
Islamic world.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, fears of nuclear confrontation with India might prompt
Pakistani leaders to rethink their demands, he argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kashmiris are not fundamentalists by nature, nor are they
violent,'' he said. ``Now what they really want is development, and
they want peace.''

MAKING EUROPEAN TRIP STUMBLE-FREE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Based on my experiences during a just-completed hiatus across
the right pond, every European seems addicted to two material
possessions: a bicycle and a cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   It's best to stay well out of harm's way when they are used
conjunctively.
</P>
<P>
   Even more precarious is the increasingly popular
cell-phone/in-line skate combo. The latter is so much the rage that
my favorite lasting image is of a 2-year-old wearing skates and
peering from a baby carriage beside Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   In time, I'll share some adventures _ and misadventures _ from a
two-week romp around Germany, Austria and Switzerland. For now,
here are random tips that may help in planning your trip or
avoiding potential pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Currency exchange is a frequent topic of debate for
international travelers. An increasing number swear by ATMs; others
warn about problems interpreting instructions written in unfamiliar
languages and cite instances of machines ``swallowing'' their cards
when they tarried too long in the translation. Credit card
purchases can provide a dependable exchange rate. And you can
almost always count on a full-service bank offering a more
favorable rate than conveniently located counters in airports and
train stations.
</P>
<P>
   Call me old-fashioned, but I still carry travelers' checks. They
can be secured in several currencies _ including French and Swiss
francs, British pounds and Deutsche marks _ prior to leaving home.
Once abroad, in contrast to the time-consuming paperwork and fees
associated with converting travelers' checks issued in U.S. dollar
denominations, they can be cashed or used for direct payments in
many hotels, restaurants and shops.
</P>
<P>
   An especially good deal: The American Automobile Association
offers foreign-denomination travelers' checks to its members at no
charge. You pay only the set exchange rate _ and AAA's rates are
competitive _ and, in theory, no commission or fee when cashing the
checks.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, no system is foolproof. Near the end of this trip, a desk
clerk at one Lake Constance-area hotel in Germany assured me with a
smile that he would happily cash my 100-mark check. I gave my
signature, and he handed me a 50-mark bill and two 20s. ``We keep
10 marks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson: Inquire in advance about charges before initiating
any transaction. Acquaintances cite similar inconsistencies in
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   I recommend exchanging a limited amount of cash, too, before
leaving home for international travel. But be aware that several
European countries have printed new currency in recent years, and
the bills look nothing like their predecessors. Yet at least one
major Houston bank is still issuing old Deutsche mark bills, as I
learned in dismay when they were rejected at a Munich restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I do?'' I asked the English-speaking concierge at my
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throw them away,'' he replied. ``They are worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing I didn't listen. Instead, I visited a Munich bank,
and the teller explained, ``Because these bills are now out of
circulation, many businesses won't take them. But any bank will
exchange them evenly for the newer bills.''
</P>
<P>
   The same proved true in Switzerland. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Multiday, multicountry rail passes purchased in the United
States remain an economical and convenient way to move around
Europe. But know exactly which specific pass you are buying and how
you intend to use it, or risk an additional expense as incurred by
dozens of travelers with whom I shared a train from Munich to
Lucerne.
</P>
<P>
   These individuals had purchased a basic Europass _ among the
most popular alternatives _ valid for unlimited first-class rail
travel in five countries, including Germany and Switzerland. But
this particular train made one quick stop in Bregenz, Austria. And
travel in Austria with a Europass requires a supplementary payment.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that none of these Europass holders intended to
depart the train in Bregenz. A strictly-by-the-book conductor
offered two options: Exit the train before leaving Germany or fork
over more cash.
</P>
<P>
   More tips:
</P>
<P>
   _ Packing light is always advisable. But if you must take along
several bags _ and I'm now admonishing the face in the mirror _
resist a taxi driver's invitation to stuff them all in the trunk of
his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Policies vary even within nations, but many European taxi fare
structures _ if such a thing exists _ include up to a $2 charge for
each item stowed in the trunk. And you are placed at a distinct
competitive disadvantage during the inevitable end-of-trip dispute
with the driver who holds your luggage hostage as he invents and
explains other unexpected charges.
</P>
<P>
   _ One of the pleasures associated with staying in small central
European hotels has always been the scarcity of room televisions,
facilitating a more complete escape from the outer world. No more.
Everybody has discovered cable. And CNN International. For about
$15 an hour, you can even access the Internet and send or receive
e-mail on some larger lodgings' in-room TVs.
</P>
<P>
   I figure next time I visit, the Swiss and Germans, having
abandoned cell phones, will be sending e-mail on computers attached
to their bicycles. Or baby carriages.

Astros end Red scare, strike late to beat Shaw
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CINCINNATI _ As far as the Astros are concerned, the first eight
innings of a game are merely a formality. Things don't count until
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in the past week, the Astros waited until
last call to pull out a victory. Facing one of the National
League's toughest closers, they rallied for five runs off
Cincinnati's Jeff Shaw over the final two innings for a 6-3 victory
in 10 innings Sunday afternoon at Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Spiers went 4-for-5, including a leadoff double that
sparked a two-run rally by the Astros in the ninth and a two-run
homer off Shaw in the 10th that enabled the Astros to notch their
first win in three tries during this four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who rallied in the ninth for two consecutive
victories against Detroit last week, won for only the second time
in six extra-inning games this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really haven't swung the bat well at all on the road trip
except for the eighth and ninth innings of every game,'' said
Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell, who had two hits. ``That's not
usually how you want to have it done. We've been fortunate to come
back three times.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't appear the Astros would get the chance for another
comeback Sunday after Cincinnati rallied for two runs in the eighth
for a 3-1 lead and sent Shaw to the mound in the ninth. He entered
with a 0.97 ERA _ best among NL closers _ and had not allowed an
earned run in his previous 25 innings.
</P>
<P>
   That streak ended in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Spiers opened the floodgates with a leadoff double, and Bagwell
followed with a one-out RBI single that sliced the Reds' lead to
3-2. Bagwell advanced to third on a single by Moises Alou, his
third hit of the game, and scored when Reds shortstop Barry Larkin
hurried the flip to second while trying to turn a double play on a
soft grounder by Carl Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going for the save, Shaw was fighting for the win. He
got neither.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Gutierrez walked to begin the Astros' 10th, stole second
and scored on Craig Biggio's single to center field for the
go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a huge comeback,'' Biggio said. ``When you lose the
first two games of the series, their guys are pitching well, and
suddenly they have a closer with an ERA of nothing on the mound, it
makes it tough. We battled and finally got some runs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros weren't finished as Spiers sent a 2-1 pitch into the
right-field stands for his second home run of the season. Spiers,
who at one point this season was batting .180, matched a career
high with four hits and came within a triple of hitting for the
cycle. He is batting .360 in his last 23 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look for that kind of game every day,'' Spiers said of his
first four-hit game since last September against San Francisco.
``It was a big win for us, getting down like we did and coming
back. I wouldn't say it was a must win, but it felt like a
pick-me-up. We needed that. Those are the kinds of games you need
to have during the course of the season if you are going to do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wagner (1-2) escaped a jam in the ninth, and after
allowing a leadoff single to Pat Watkins in the 10th, struck out
the final three batters.
</P>
<P>
   Astros righthander Sean Bergman kept the Reds scoreless for five
innings before Eddie Taubensee homered to lead off the sixth.
Bergman allowed two runs and eight hits in 7 innings and struck out
a season-high seven. He worked out of threats in the second and
fourth innings, when the Reds put two runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman's counterpart, Cincinnati righthander Scott Winchester,
was just as impressive. Winchester, who hadn't struck out more than
three batters in his previous nine major-league starts, had a
three-hitter and a career-high seven strikeouts before being
replaced to begin the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Winchester was removed that the Astros managed
to get on the scoreboard. Facing reliever Scott Sullivan, Alou hit
his 15th home run of the season and third in six games to forge a
1-1 in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of Alou's home run, I'm not sure we hit any balls hard
for seven or eight innings. It looked feeble,'' Astros manager
Larry Dierker said. ``I hope this helps shake a few guys out (of
their slumps). Honestly, I don't think we are playing our best
baseball right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati regained the lead in the eighth on Eduardo Perez's
two-run, bases-loaded single off Mike Magnante. The Reds started
the uprising when Dmitri Young doubled to left-center field with
one out off Bergman and Bret Boone singled to the mound, the ball
deflecting off Magnante's glove. Magnante walked Melvin Nieves on
four pitches to load the bases and set up Perez's pinch-hit single.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, the Astros did what they do best. Wait until
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it speaks a lot about the character of this club,''
said Dierker, whose team is 5-20 when trailing after the eighth
inning. ``But I also think it also says we haven't been quite as
good for the first eight innings like we were earlier this year.''

Jordan reinforces legend as Bulls lengthen title run
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SALT LAKE CITY _ If this was farewell, Michael Jordan did more than
just fare well. He went out like the true master he is.
</P>
<P>
   And if this is the end of the line for the Chicago Bulls as the
sports world has come to know them, they made sure nobody can
question their status as one of the greatest dynasties in NBA
history.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan hit his last two shots, including an 18-footer with 5.2
seconds left after he had stripped Utah's Karl Malone, and the
Bulls earned a hard-fought 87-86 victory to win the NBA
championship Sunday night at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the Bulls know the meaning of sixcess. Their 4-2 win in
the Finals gave them their sixth title _ and second three-peat _ in
the past eight years. For Jordan, championships have come in the
past six consecutive seasons he started with the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   With sidekick Scottie Pippen hindered by a painful back injury,
Jordan took the Bulls on his shoulders and escorted them to
greatness. He had 45 points, including the Bulls' last eight when
they overcame an 83-79 deficit in the final 2:10. And when John
Stockton's 3-pointer at the buzzer missed, the Bulls were dancing _
maybe last-dancing _ around the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael's a guy who always comes through in the clutch,''
Bulls coach Phil Jackson said. ``He's a real-life hero. Last year
in the fifth game (of the Finals), I didn't think he could top
that. But I think this is the greatest moment he's ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's effort earned him a unanimous Most Valuable Player vote
for the Finals. And it came under difficult circumstances. The Jazz
had the lead virtually throughout the final three quarters. But it
never got more than six points ahead. And when the door cracked for
a Michael Moment, he delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the toughest route, the toughest challenge we've had in
the six championships we've won,'' Jordan said. ``That was part of
the challenge. After Game 5, there were some negative thoughts. But
I think we all realized that if we wanted to win the sixth title,
we were going to have to play our best game and we were going to
have to do it in Utah.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan in particular responded.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton's 3-pointer with 41.9 seconds left put the Jazz ahead
86-83. Those were the only points the Jazz scored in the final 2:30
as the Chicago defense dug in. But Jordan countered with a driving
bucket with 36 seconds to play. Before that shot, he had been
2-for-8 from the field in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Jordan again showed he's no one-trick pony. The Jazz tried
to get the ball to Malone in the low post. Malone was having a
monster game with 31 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists. But as
Malone received the ball from Stockton, Jordan stopped tracking
Jeff Hornacek and snuck behind Malone on his right side and made a
clean steal.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than call timeout, Jordan attacked. He got the ball in
one of his favorite spots, near the 3-point line just to the left
of the top of the circle. He started to drive on Bryon Russell,
then saw Russell slip slightly just after he had reached in to try
to disrupt Jordan's drive.
</P>
<P>
   That was all it took. Jordan was wide-open and swished the
18-footer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been trying to double-team him,'' he said of the steal
against Malone. ``Hornacek never really cleared, and I was able to
come up from behind. Once I got the ball, I saw 18 seconds left,
and I knew I couldn't call timeout and give them a chance to set up
their defense. It was a do-or-die situation. I let the clock tick
until I had the court set up the way I wanted it. As soon as
Russell reached, I pulled up.''
</P>
<P>
   And Utah, which had forced Game 6 with a gritty 83-81 win Friday
in Chicago, had to settle for second-best for the second year in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a terrific team, and he (Jordan) is a terrific
player,'' said Utah coach Jerry Sloan. ``I think the thing that
hurt us was that we had some turnovers down the stretch, and you
can't afford to give this team second chances, because you know
Michael is going to make the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   And if this is Jordan's last game?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody knows how he should be remembered,'' Sloan
said. ``He's the best player that's ever played the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing he did Sunday would change Sloan's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   After Jordan's shot, the Jazz had slightly more than five
seconds to try to pull out the win. But Stockton's 3-pointer after
he used a high screen hit the front of the rim. It was short all
the way, and he didn't get a home-court bounce off the rim.
</P>
<P>
   Then the celebration began. And so did the questions about the
Bulls' future.
</P>
<P>
   ``How sweet it is,'' Jackson said. ``It was a wonderful win for
us. They put up a heck of a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   And about the future?
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is we planned this as our last year,'' Jackson
said. ``Right now, we're celebrating that way. All we can do is
celebrate. Unless something comes out of left field, I don't expect
to see us back here again. It's been a great run.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan gave no clues about his intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gut feeling,'' Jordan said. ``When I walked away the
first time (for a short-lived baseball career), it was a feeling.
When the time comes and I walk away, I hope nobody will think less
of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Stockton: ``He's going to be back. Scottie's going to be
back. And Dennis (Rodman). And Phil. I'm tired of hearing all that.
But it worked for them.''
</P>
<P>
   There were some crazy moments early in the game. First, the
Bulls found out what life without Pippen would be like. He left the
game with 4:56 to go in the first quarter and did not return in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen looked mobile and active as the game began. He dunked
Chicago's first points after a lob pass from Ron Harper. But it
wasn't long before Pippen was favoring his back. Without him, Bulls
such as Jud Buechler and Bill Wennington were leaned on to produce.

SCHOOLS TAKE STEPS TO CURB THREAT OF GUN VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RICK KARLIN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Students returning to Rensselaer Junior-Senior
High School next year may have a new safety drill. Administrators
are considering having students practice how they would respond if
a gunman were to show up at school.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of recent deadly shootings at schools in Arkansas,
Kentucky, Mississippi and Oregon, students are facing a climate of
heightened security. Even idle talk of violence can result in
suspensions or formal charges as educators grapple with how to
respond to the threats without causing undue alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear is, you'll become the next poster boy for everything
that is wrong,'' said Blaise Salerno, superintendent of the
Guilderland school system in upstate New York. ``Everybody in the
administrations are just getting blitzed if you don't take
everything seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   But can schools go too far, creating a climate of fear? There is
concern a crackdown will lead to a spate of lawsuits for throwing
out students who don't plan to act on their statements.
</P>
<P>
   That happened with the zero-tolerance policies schools have
instituted regarding drugs. In some cases, children were suspended
for taking Advil or Midol to school. Those suspensions led to
several lawsuits, said Renee Williams, spokeswoman for the National
School Boards Association in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Students themselves are sometimes confused by the latest
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   A Rensselaer student was recently suspended for drawing a
cartoon showing a student shooting a teacher. Soon after, school
officials held an assembly to explain their new policy against even
the most casual threats of violence. After the meeting, a couple of
students tested the policy and joked about going home and getting
guns. They too, were suspended.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, violent cartoons or threats made in jest would
have meant, ``a detention or two,'' said Adam Mancini, a
seventh-grader at Rensselaer.
</P>
<P>
   Said Rensselaer Principal Mike Dawkins: ``We don't have the
luxury to make the judgments as to whether you meant what you
said.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, while increasing school violence has been a concern
for much of the 1990s, statistics do not point to any sudden,
short-term tidal wave of violence, despite the isolated but highly
publicized shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these incidents prompt some experts to call for action.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wake-up call,'' said Kevin Dwyer, spokesman for the
National Association of School Psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer's organization has long maintained that schools don't have
enough psychologists and others who can weave a social safety net
for troubled children. And he worries that punitive, zero-tolerance
policies won't address underlying problems facing students who
fight or make threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to talk more about solutions, more about long-term
kinds of planning,'' Dwyer said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, the shootings of the past few months have, if
nothing else, focused attention on school violence and behavior
problems in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gotten calls from the National Association of
Elementary School Principals and American Association of School
Administrators, asking `What should we be doing?' This is really a
very positive change.''

GOLDWATER'S LAST DAYS: FEARLESS, FUNNY UNTIL END, WIFE RECALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; ``EDITOR'S NOTE: In her first major interview since her
89-year-old husband's death May 29,'' ``Susan Goldwater talks in
detail about his final days and months''.
</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ ``You're my wife, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Goldwater was recovering from a major stroke that had
caused swelling in the frontal lobe of his brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what they tell me,'' answered Susan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if you weren't, I'd ask you to marry me anyway,'' he
replied.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1996. As his mental and physical condition deteriorated
over the following two years, he never lost his ability to come up
with a humorous twist or a gentlemanly compliment to cover the
confusions and disorientations of his stroke-induced disorder,
which goes by the name of multi-infarct dementia.
</P>
<P>
   There would be moments when he couldn't quite place Susan
immediately. But he would remember in detail conversations of 25 or
50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He spent most of those days looking out over the Phoenix skyline
from the native rock home atop a hill near 44th Street and McDonald
Drive. There, he had lived most of his adult life _ seven years of
it with Susan, his second wife.
</P>
<P>
   She was a nurse who showed up at his door one day to take his
blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Once they got to know each other, she assumed the task of
finding him a suitable woman friend his age. Playing matchmaker for
one of Arizona's crustiest characters proved too much for her
social Rolodex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what about you?'' he asked her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too young,'' she replied, not wanting to say that he was
too old.
</P>
<P>
   He looked her up and down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you're not that young,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So that was that, and they were married 2{ years later. That was
almost seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very, you know, Barry-like,'' is the best way she can describe
the man she married.
</P>
<P>
   Through most of last year, standing or sitting at the great
picture windows of his ranchlike home, he watched the construction
of Bank One Ballpark in the distance, and worried that its massive
bulk might mar the cityscape. But he loved baseball, so he let it
go.
</P>
<P>
   He built dozens of model airplanes and ships, painting them in
meticulous detail _ a skill that grew less perfect in his last
year. He knew the specifications of the planes and had flown the
real versions of most of them.
</P>
<P>
   His old photo lab had been turned into a miniature factory for
the mass production of these symbols of his highest-flying days. He
had, after all, almost single-handedly remodeled the American
military as the powerful chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He kept a busy schedule of seeing visitors and answering letters
from his command post in the living room. He went for almost daily
car rides with certified nursing assistant Joel Carey, his personal
caregiver and designated driver. They went cruising for milkshakes
and to see the sights.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got any money?'' he would ask Carey as they left.
</P>
<P>
   ``That goddamned Susan never leaves me any,'' he would quip.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never, ever got too ill to kid,'' Carey said. For much of
the past two years Goldwater used a walker. He didn't use a
wheelchair until the final few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   About six months ago, a change came over the senator and former
presidential candidate. He didn't challenge Susan and his
caregivers at every turn or want to go out for a drive as often.
One morning he didn't even want to get out of bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you giving up?'' Susan asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving up on what?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On just pushing through, being up and about and living. Some
people give up and want to die,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, no! I love life,'' he said. Susan Goldwater said that he
meant it with deep sincerity. But she believes he was making a
transition to a new place. He was doing the hard spiritual work of
preparing himself.
</P>
<P>
   He became very selective in seeing visitors, preferring to spend
time with his brother and sister and a few old friends and
political associates. His world was narrowing. He stopped going for
rides altogether, and as the months went by lost interest in
answering his mail and even in making airplanes and ships.
</P>
<P>
   The aperture of his world view _ and it had been a wide one _
closed ever more as he curled inward to a world of comfort and
loving care.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a naturally occurring part of life,'' Susan said. ``At
the beginning of life a baby wants comfort and love and nurturing.
That's what we want at the end, too. And that is what we gave to
Barry.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the caregivers really understood what Barry was doing,
there was an effort to get him up and active. They even considered
some kind of group therapy _ for about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was painful to think that he might become bedridden, so we
tried not to let that happen,'' Susan said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gillian Hamilton, who works at Hospice of the Valley,
finally suggested that they simply let the senator do as he had
always done _ whatever he wanted to do. That worked best.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Goldwater, executive director of Hospice of the Valley,
was getting a lesson in end-of-life care from another perspective.
She was developing a new awe for the energy and time it takes to
care well for someone, even someone with great resources. For
others, she realized, more needs to be done somehow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't have this round-the-clock support, I don't know
what I would have done,'' said the energetic 58-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``I'm not the average spouse of an 85-to-89-year-old _ the
average spouse would be 75 to 85 and would not be a hospice worker
with all these resources and knowledge,'' she said. ``I can
understand why depression would enter in _ why there would be
desperation and disorganization.'' The wheels were spinning in the
professional part of her mind but she hasn't a plan or solution
yet.
</P>
<P>
   During the last two months, the senator spent more time in bed.
His caregivers propped up his bedding so he could look out toward
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``His Valley,'' the family called it.
</P>
<P>
   He watched political hearings on C-SPAN and some sporting
events. In the final weeks his attention turned to shows about
nature. Often, he just observed the native landscape surrounding
his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He adapted to every new part of his life, even in these last
days,'' Susan observed. He accepted the mission ahead.
</P>
<P>
   A month or so before his death he became more articulate than he
had been in days before. She asked: ``Are you frightened about
anything coming to this point in your life?''
</P>
<P>
   He looked at her with calm surprise: ``Frightened? I don't think
I've been frightened of anything in my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   It was genuine, Susan said. ``There was no question in my mind
that he meant that. I think he was dealing with what was coming,
and I believe he knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was not frightened. I don't think he was delighted
either. He was not one of those people who is going to fold his
hands across his chest and say he's happy to go meet his Lord. That
was not who Barry was. I think he would much rather have lived.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was a realist, she continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were, say, climbing Everest, Barry would be the type to
see the storm coming and know when to tell the guys to go back down
the slope. He would want to keep climbing, but know it's time to
head down. I think he faced that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Barry was working through a lot of undefinable issues
in his own soul during the last week of his life. We watched him
when he was in bed _ he was more peaceful than he'd been in the
previous month. I think he was working things out.''
</P>
<P>
   She walked into the living room one day to see him sitting in a
well-worn leather chair silently holding the hand of his 4-year-old
step-granddaughter, Rebecca, who enjoyed helping the nurse by using
a play stethoscope to take the senator's vital signs.
</P>
<P>
   Those vital signs started on a long glide path downward in the
last week of his life, and the family gathered around. But the
89-year-old Arizonan was, to the eyes of Susan Goldwater, totally
happy and peaceful. She watched and listened closely. He was, she
believes, mentally flying over his favorite lands in northern
Arizona, or traveling those parts again with his beloved mother,
Josephine _ Arizona's pioneer nurse.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of flying over Arizona was a comfort to Susan, too.
Her favorite memories of Barry are of long plane flights with him
over the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would know every rock down there, and have stories about
it. To me, he was a part of the landscape,'' she said. And always a
stubborn part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He, of course, would have wanted to choose his last moment,
and I believe he did. I think he made a decision the morning he
died. I saw it,'' she said. ``He had been quietly winding down in
terms of his vital signs. Then his eyes opened a little and that
blue was really showing. Then he closed his eyes very tight _ the
way he made a face sometimes when he was making a decision. I
believe I saw Barry deciding to let go. I could feel his spirit
just soaring away.''
</P>
<P>
   He died shortly after sunrise May 29, on a day of unusual winds
and cool temperatures. Good tail winds, one might say, for an easy
flight north over the canyons.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks have passed.
</P>
<P>
   There are now hundreds of letters and notes in piles on the
tables of the Goldwater home. Susan and other family members have
them sorted into piles: answered, read but not answered, not read,
and letters so dear that they must be read again. Some are just
addressed to ``The Goldwater Family, Phoenix, Arizona.'' She reads
them as a comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Carey is still helping the household cope with the change.
After two years, he has become an unofficial member of the family.
On Friday he was helping Susan and her 35-year-old daughter, Samara
Hutman, sort through the letters from princes and regular guys.
Barry was both, they agreed by the stories they remember as they
sorted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; She will start returning to her duties at Hospice of the Valley
this week, having learned again things she has learned several
times before: that death is a personal experience, not a medical
event, and that death can be and should be peaceful and
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing that can't be managed at home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan will stay in that home for now. She doesn't know what she
will do with the leftover time _ the hole. But she has books to
read, she says. And letters to write. &QL;

BOARDING PASSES TAKE A NOSEDIVE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J.)   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Advance boarding passes are becoming relics. Tim Smith, a
spokesman for American Airlines, which stopped issuing them June 1,
said they actually became useless almost two years ago, after the
July 1996 explosion aboard a Trans World Airlines plane off Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   The government quickly tightened security regulations then, and
all passengers are now required to go to an airport counter to
present photo identification before boarding any flight.
</P>
<P>
   As a traveler, I did not grasp that the game was up until early
this year, when I flew from New York to Miami on the briefly
rejuvenated Pan Am. A friend and I arrived at the airport in good
time, but found a snaking line. If we had boarding passes, we were
told, we could go straight to the gate.
</P>
<P>
   We did have advance boarding passes, and seat assignments,
courtesy of our travel agent. But at the gate, we were told the
passes, despite their labels, were not boarding passes: only the
agent at the airport could issue boarding passes that were valid.
</P>
<P>
   These days travel agents cannot issue advance boarding passes,
and most airlines have stopped issuing them entirely. Security is
not the only reason: advance boarding passes were formerly issued
to overseas travelers, even though they were subject to passport
control long before the TWA explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The other blow to the boarding pass is the airlines' rising use
of so-called electronic tickets, whereby the ``ticket'' is only a
record in the airline's computer system, and a boarding pass is
issued when the passenger appears at the airport and presents
identification, usually including the credit card that was used to
buy the ``ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   As the airlines have pressed their ticketless tickets _ American
says they now constitute 50 percent of sales where there is a
choice _ the boarding pass has lost another round.
</P>
<P>
   This is a situation in transition. Northwest stopped issuing
advance boarding passes last November; Continental followed.
American and TWA, which both stopped June 1, and United, which
stopped June 8, are the most recent. US Airways announced on June
12 that it would stop providing advance boarding passes on July 7.
Delta was still providing them domestically as of June 15, but a
change seemed imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The black hole at the center of this shift is the question
whether a particular seat is being held for the traveler, or if the
traveler is merely one of 250 people planning to board a
150-passenger plane. The advance boarding pass usually gave the
seat number, and families traveling together clutched those passes
like security blankets, as one airline employee said.
</P>
<P>
   The passes with seat numbers were a bulwark against being
separated from the children or, worst of all, being left behind.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines report that boarding is no more harried than
before, but the change is still new.
</P>
<P>
   For vacationers, as opposed to executives hurrying to a
conference, the issue then becomes how early can a seat assignment
be given, and what documentation of this assignment is available in
the likely event of overbooking?
</P>
<P>
   The time period during which seat assignments are made in
advance varies. The period starts when a line's computer system
creates a diagram of the cabin for a particular flight. The
computer model will have certain choice seats marked out that will
never be assigned until just before the flight because they are
held for travelers who book late and therefore pay the highest
price, even in the coach section.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here are the advance time periods reported by the seven major
United States airlines:
</P>
<P>
   Continental will provide a seat assignment 335 days in advance
of a flight.
</P>
<P>
   United, 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   American, 331 days.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways, 130 days. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Northwest, 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   TWA, 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Delta, 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Any early purchaser of a ticket who is concerned about seat
location, whether the ticket is bought from a travel agent or from
an airline, should ask for a seat assignment at the time the deal
is made.
</P>
<P>
   If the airline says it is too early, the passenger should then
ask if a seat preference can be recorded, for example, two aisle
seats across from each other. Not all airlines will accept
preferences.
</P>
<P>
   The next question is: If I cannot enter a preference, or I
forget to, will the computer take care of this and pop my
reservation into a specific seat when the window period opens?
Generally not, although some airline officials wobbled in their
answers.
</P>
<P>
   For a ticket bought before seat assignments are accepted _ a
situation more likely at Delta, Northwest and TWA than at the four
others _ the traveler should call promptly when seat assignments
are possible. Because the going and return dates are different, it
may take two telephone calls to get a specific seat in each
direction.
</P>
<P>
   A number of scenarios were put before the airline people. For
example, suppose a traveler forgets to call at the right time to
get a seat assignment and then the flight is overbooked? Is this
traveler at a disadvantage compared with the traveler who has an
assignment and a fax or a memo with the number on it? Generally the
answer was yes.
</P>
<P>
   The airline spokesmen emphasized that so long as passengers
check in ahead of deadline _ 30 minutes or so before flight time,
when all remaining seat assignments are released _ they should get
on the flight. But they agreed that lines get long and people with
no seat assignments are sometimes last.
</P>
<P>
   The seat assignment period is the moment when the travel agent
is the passenger's best friend: the agent has messages that pop up
in the computer that should ward off the memory failure that flesh
is heir to. Better yet, the agent can then send the traveler a
modified itinerary that will list the seat numbers for all legs.
That at least is something to hold in the hand when push comes to
shove.
</P>
<P>
   The seat-assignment issue is tightly knitted into the paperless
ticket. These bookings, which can be made from a cell phone on the
way to the airport and require no physical delivery, are far more
popular with business travelers than with others.
</P>
<P>
   Bernice Rosmarin, director of special projects at Stratton
Travel in Franklin Lakes, N.J., said a few months ago that she had
not found ``one leisure client so far'' willing to accept a
paperless ticket. Now she says she has found one or two among the
30 percent of her clients who are leisure travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The paperless system has smoothed out, she said. ``But I feel as
if we have taken 20 steps backward,'' she added. ``There are a lot
of people who have never flown before who take a flight and they
want something to hold in their hands.'' They may indeed get a
ticket to hold, but they are unlikely ever to see an advance
boarding pass.

<P>
   Disease is depressing; depression complicates recovery from
disease. That vicious circle has proved especially intractable for
older people who have severe coronary problems, compounded by the
fact that the main class of antidepressant drugs used in the last
20 years often made heart conditions worse.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it appears that newer antidepressants, including Prozac,
may be safer for people with heart disease, a study published last
month in the American Journal of Psychiatry says.
</P>
<P>
   The study, led by Dr. Stephen Roose of Columbia University,
followed 87 patients who had severe heart disease and severe
depression. Three-quarters of the group were men, and the average
age was 73.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven of the patients were treated with fluoxetine, the
drug generally known as Prozac, the most widely used of the new
antidepressants, known as selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors.
In a comparison group, 60 other patients were treated with
nortriptyline, one of the older class of antidepressant drugs,
known as tricyclics.
</P>
<P>
   Over the seven weeks of the study, heart functions worsened for
12 of the 60 patients receiving a trycyclic; by contrast, only one
of the 27 patients receiving Prozac grew worse, and a number of
patients in that group showed improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roose cautioned against drawing too broad a conclusion from
such a short, small study, but he added, ``The data we do have are
encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   SMOKING MAY HARM HEARING
</P>
<P>
   Add hearing loss to the list of maladies cigarette smoking may
cause in middle-aged and elderly Americans. Researchers at the
University of Wisconsin Medical School found that smokers were
nearly 1.7 times as likely to suffer hearing loss than nonsmokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This suggests that age-related hearing loss isn't inevitable
but might be preventable,'' said Dr. Karen J. Cruickshanks, the
associate professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences who led
the research team. The study, which was published in the June 3
issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, was
financed by the National Institute on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, Dr. Cruickshanks and her colleagues evaluated
3,753 people between ages 48 and 92. They all lived in Beaver Dam,
Wis., a town of 20,000, about 40 miles northeast of Madison, that
had been used before for studies about the connection between
smoking and vision. Of the hearing study group, 46 percent were
nonsmokers, 30.3 percent used to smoke and 14.7 still smoked.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of hearing loss increased the more a person smoked.
For example, those who smoked a pack a day for 40 years were 1.3
times more likely to have hearing loss than someone who smoked a
pack a day for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Cruickshanks said the next step in her research would be a
five-year follow-up study that would try to explain how smoking
causes the hearing damage.

AMERICANS ARE DRINKING THEMSELVES DRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(lh) 
 By CAROL KAESUK YOON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Americans may be literally drinking themselves into a
state of dehydration, a new survey reports.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans drink an average of eight cups of water and
other hydrating beverages each day, they counter the positive
effects by drinking five servings of caffeinated or alcoholic
beverages, which dehydrate the body, according to a survey of the
drinking habits of 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The result, said Dr. Barbara Levine, director of the Nutrition
Information Center at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center,
is a dehydrated nation. The problem is that the alcohol and
caffeine in these beverages are diuretics, substances that cause a
person to urinate more, resulting in a net loss of water.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers, the survey reports, are right on the national
averages, drinking an average of 8.5 cups of hydrating beverages _
which include milk, juice and caffeine-free carbonated drinks and
water _ and 4.5 cups of caffeinated or alcoholic beverages a day.
For water alone, New Yorkers consume five cups a day; the national
average is 4.6.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, sponsored by the International Bottled Water
Association and the Nutrition Information Center, interviewed 200
adults in each of 15 cities. Unpublished survey results were
released last month.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of knowledge is not the problem. Most people said they were
aware that experts recommend drinking eight glasses of water a day
and that some beverages, like coffee, were dehydrating. The reasons
for not keeping well hydrated varied from not having enough time to
not liking the taste of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's something with flavor to it, I'll drink it
instead,'' said Vic Rodriguez, an accountant from Long Island,
whose preferred drinks are Coca-Cola and iced tea. ``I'm not going
to stop to think, `Let me have a glass of water because it's going
to be more hydrating.' I'll just have the soda.''
</P>
<P>
   Not drinking enough water can have costs. People who drank three
or fewer glasses a day were more likely to suffer symptoms like
grogginess upon waking and dry skin, experts said. And the benefits
of adequate hydration are many.
</P>
<P>
   Monona Yin, program officer at a private foundation in Manhattan
and one of the better hydrated people in the city, said she has one
cup of coffee in the morning but then drinks from a pitcher of
water all day.``It keeps me from eating something horrible,'' she
said, noting water's power as an appetite suppressant. It's also
very economical, she added. ``I drink the free things in the
office, coffee and water.'' Other benefits include regular
digestion and the prevention of headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Levine said people should drink the equivalent of eight
glasses of water a day. If they drink coffee or other dehydrating
beverages they should offset the loss by drinking an additional
glass of water. People should not wait until they are thirsty to
drink, she said, because by then the body is dehydrated, in a
deficit of perhaps two cups of fluids.

<P>
   Why, with the abundance of artificially sweetened, low-fat and
nonfat foods now widely available, do Americans continue to get
fatter and fatter? And why, with the endless stream of popular
diets and weight-loss plans, do Americans repeatedly fail at losing
weight and keeping it off?
</P>
<P>
   If you know the answers to these questions, you have already
taken the first step toward permanent weight control. If you don't
know, I'll tell you.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT AMERICANS EAT
</P>
<P>
   We only think we're eating carefully by choosing sugar-free or
fat-free foods. Most fat-free foods have nearly as many calories as
their full-fat counterparts. One-half cup of fat-free pudding, 140
calories; regular, 160. Five fat-free soda crackers, 50 calories;
regular, 60. One ounce of fat-free pretzels, 110; regular, 110.
Furthermore, most people fail to note the portion size that
supplies the specified number of calories, or they think they can
have double the amount they usually eat because the food is
fat-free.
</P>
<P>
   Calories always count, whether they come from fat, sugar, starch
or protein. Read the nutrition information on the label of all
packaged foods to know what you are eating and determine the
appropriate portion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the popularity of artificial sweeteners, Americans
continue to increase their consumption of caloric sweeteners. Since
1970, annual per capita consumption of sugar and other caloric
sweeteners has risen by nearly 30 pounds. Artificial sweeteners
merely feed the desire for the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   As for fats, while the percentage of calories from fat that
Americans consume per person has fallen, from about 42 percent to
34 percent, we now consume about 10 pounds of added fats and oils
more than we did in 1970. Consumption of cheese is also way up,
thanks to our passion for pizza, cheeseburgers, tacos and the like.
The percentage of calories from fat has declined only because we
are consuming more calories. Will artificial fats help this
picture? Judging from the effects of artificial sweeteners, I think
not.
</P>
<P>
   Home cooking, where the cook knows exactly what is in each dish,
has fallen off sharply. More than 40 percent of the American food
dollar is now spent on foods eaten out. Restaurant portions are
typically two or more times larger than they should be, and they
are often loaded with hidden calories. When 203 dietitians were
asked to estimate the calorie and fat content of five restaurant
meals, they were often way off. They guessed that a hamburger and
onion rings would provide 863 calories and 44 grams of fat when the
meal contained 1,550 calories and 101 grams of fat. They thought a
tuna salad sandwich had 374 calories and 18 grams of fat when the
displayed sandwich actually contained 720 calories and 43 grams of
fat. If a trained food specialist cannot tell what's in foods eaten
out, how can you?
</P>
<P>
   Consumption of snack foods continues its decades-long rise, with
new high-calorie snacks constantly luring consumers away from more
nutritious and lower caloric alternatives like fruit or yogurt. One
Mrs. Field's oatmeal raisin walnut cookie has 240 calories; one Au
Bon Pain blueberry muffin, 430 calories; one Starbucks cinnamon
scone, 530 calories, and one cinnabon, 670 calories.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SHOULD WE EAT?
</P>
<P>
   You know the answer: lots of fruits and vegetables and
grain-based foods rich in fiber, vitamins and minerals and low in
calories, fleshed out with modest amounts of animal protein _
4-ounce portions of well-trimmed meat, skinless poultry or fish _
and low-fat and nonfat dairy foods. Not only would such a diet
reduce caloric intake and the proportion of overweight Americans.
It would also significantly reduce the risk of developing a long
list of chronic, often fatal diseases, including heart disease and
many cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every fad diet, especially those that rely on
formulas, drugs, and restricted food groups or combinations of
foods, ultimately fails, regardless of initial enthusiasm and
weight loss. The trick is not in losing but in maintaining the
loss, not for a year or two, but forever. This requires a diet that
you can go on and stay on for the rest of your life.
</P>
<P>
   While following a fad for two weeks may help you get started,
the route to permanent weight control demands that you soon adopt
an eating plan that can be followed indefinitely. That means it
must be complete in essential nutrients, rich in fiber and designed
to preserve your lean body mass _ muscle and bone _ while you lose
fat. If you restrict carbohydrates, your body will use more muscle
to meet its energy needs. Your eating plan should also offer
variety and fit your life, whether you eat at home or in
restaurants, travel a lot or entertain often.
</P>
<P>
   Many people are unaware of what and how much they eat and would
benefit greatly from keeping a food diary for a week or two,
recording quantities of everything they eat and drink. It should
soon be obvious where the extra calories are coming from and what
changes are needed to lose weight. Keep in mind that all fats and
oils have about the same number of calories _ 120 per tablespoon _
and that starches, sugars and proteins have less than half that (a
tablespoon of sugar, for example, has about 48 calories). Also,
water has no calories, and every sensible weight-loss regimen urges
followers to drink eight cups of water a day.
</P>
<P>
   EXERCISE IS ESSENTIAL
</P>
<P>
   No more than a small percentage of successful dieters make it
without exercise. Physical activity is crucial to preserving muscle
while losing fat and to shedding health-damaging abdominal excess.
Exercise also partly compensates for the metabolic slowdown that
occurs when caloric intake is reduced and pounds are lost. You may
expect exercise to stimulate hunger, but more often it does the
opposite. Furthermore, dieters who continue to exercise after
reaching their weight goal are more likely to keep the lost pounds
off.
</P>
<P>
   Make regular exercise a permanent part of your life. As a
calorie burner, every form of exercise counts, from gardening and
dog walking to strength training and jogging. To minimize boredom,
it helps to have several active options.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been sedentary for some time, start slowly and focus
on consistency at first. Then gradually increase the duration,
intensity and frequency of your activities. If possible, build up
to doing one or two high-intensity workouts each week. If you are
already active though overweight, try to extend your current
workout or add a new activity to your routine. Last winter was the
first in decades that my weight did not creep up because I added a
daily three-mile walk to my other activities.

SURFING THE NET

   LEAVING NOTHING TO CHANCE: Plus a Permanent Record &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.recipeswinetravel.com &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some people cross the last ``t'' and dot the last ``i'' when
planning a trip. Others of us are more casual. Still others may
carelessly dot a ``t'' or two. Multimedia Travel Workshop is for
the first group, although the merely moderately obsessive may find
it good for discipline. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the Workshop, which comes on a CD-ROM for Windows 95 or
Windows NT, you write your own travel guide before you take the
trip. Back home, you can share the highlights of the journey on
your computer with friends in a fin de siecle equivalent of setting
up a projector and screen and dimming the lights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Information about hotels, restaurants, sights and landmarks can
be typed into the detailed forms provided on the screen from books,
magazine and newspaper articles, and personal recommendations, or
downloaded from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The entries are automatically indexed and can be viewed
subsequently as detailed lists (how detailed depends on your
perseverance); as simpler lists that face pages with other
information, including a photograph of the establishment if you
have taken one with a digital camera or scanned or downloaded one,
and various other formats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Workshop, a product of Craftsbury Software, of Chevy Chase,
Md., contains a guide to Washington by way of inspiration. There
are also routines to build itineraries, maintain calendars, keep
track of frequent-flier miles and calculate currency exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   A packing checklist is divided into things to store in the
suitcase (such essentials as shoes, socks and a corkscrew) and
things to carry on (tickets, passport and a blindfold for sleeping
on the plane). It's a program with many features, but easy enough
to run if you are acquainted with other Windows software. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can sample the Multimedia Travel Workshop at
www.recipeswinetravel.com. Here there are numerous examples of
guide pages, itineraries, calendars and diaries, as well as a
frequently updated list of other relevant Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which is $34.95, can be ordered from the Web site,
or by calling (301) 656-1029. As the name of the site suggests,
Craftsbury Software also produces recipe and wine programs, which
can be sampled at the site. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PLANNING FOR EUROPE: Preview Vacations &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New and updated CD-ROMs &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Planetware, of Richmond Hill, Ontario, has issued two CD-ROMs
that amount to travel encyclopedias with, according to the company,
40,000 sites and events in 21 European countries, 900 photographs,
700 maps, 3.6 million words and the texts of 27 Baedeker travel
books. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The two CDs are the Mediterranean Travel Planner, which is new,
and the Northern Europe Travel Planner, which is an updated version
of a disk first released in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   If you are going to Britain or France for the first time, you
will find the sights you have to see; if you are a veteran, you
will find the sights you didn't see on earlier trips. Since the
disks are almost endlessly searchable, you can look for sites of
personal interest _ coin collections, wax museums, caves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for hotels or restaurants, though, or try to reserve
tickets. Planetware wisely does not include such time-sensitive
information on the disks, which work with Windows 3.1 or Windows 95
and are widely available at retail outlets for $44.95 each or
less. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MOOD ENHANCERS: Brochures Galore &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.wwb.com &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Planning a trip wouldn't be complete without a collection of
brochures from tourist organizations, cruise lines and hotels. They
are handier to refer to than Web sites, and of course you can get
them from the Web. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide Brochures says it offers more than 10,000 free maps,
guides and brochures. There are several options for searching. I
tried the ``dictionary,'' a page bearing an alphabet where you
click on the first letter of the destination, event or topic you
are interested in. I clicked on ``m'' and got a lengthy list,
beginning with Maalaea and ending with Mzima Springs.
</P>
<P>
   I stopped at My Old Kentucky Home and, a couple of clicks later,
was invited to add a brochure about the state park in central
Kentucky to my electronic cart. Ten minutes here and you could fill
your mailbox for months. &QL;

   As of early January, Mike Nick was an unknown, just a stocky
21-year-old who could do crazy tricks like aerial spins and flips
on short, fat planks that resemble miniature snowboards. Then he
won the first-ever skiboarding contest at the winter X Games in
Crested Butte, Colo., and he was mobbed by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen ringed him slopeside, and the announcer for ESPN _ which
produces the X Games and broadcasts the alternative-sports Olympics
on its two cable TV channels _ informed a million-plus viewers that
Nick, a junior at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh,
was now ``the sensation of rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   You could almost hear the cash registers going ka-ching.

   Skiboarding, a sport that didn't even exist until 1995, had
suddenly become legitimate. A six-stop professional skiboarding
tour has been organized for next year; Nick's sponsor, Line
Skiboards of Albany, N.Y., instantly doubled its production staff.
And now a host of entrepreneurs are slouching toward San Diego, in
hopes of emulating Line's smashing success.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth annual Summer X Games will open at San Diego's
Mariner's Point Friday, June 19, offering 10 days of manic
athleticism and unceasing commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   In-line skaters and barefoot water-ski jumpers will flail
beneath the banners of Taco Bell and the U.S. Marine Corps, each of
which paid more than a million dollars to become an X Games ``gold
sponsor.''
</P>
<P>
   Spectators will sip free Mountain Dew (thanks to its maker's
gold status) and promoters of fledging sports like mountainboarding
(think skateboarding on dirt) will work the sidelines, trying to
garner inclusion in next summer's X.
</P>
<P>
   While high-risk, attitude-laden extreme sports like
skateboarding might have once been about having fun and busting
free of the confining rules of traditional sports, they are now
increasingly about money.
</P>
<P>
   Mini-industries sprout up around each nascent sport the moment
it's born, and the manufacturers, tour promoters and impresarios of
Web sites like www.snakeboarding.com all desperately need ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   The summer and winter X Games, begun in 1995 and 1997, are by
far the world's best-known alternative-sports festivals. And
because the people tuning in to ingest the games' smorgasbord of
street lugeing to bicycle stunt riding are, quite often, young men
willing to risk their own necks, ESPN holds the power to make a
sport chic.
</P>
<P>
   Consider snowmobiling. When snowmobiling made its debut at this
year's winter X, Men's Journal magazine rhapsodized, ``Forget the
old stereotype of dirty-fingered, chain-smoking rural gearheads.
Snowmobiling has gone sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed quite possible that top snowmobilers would soon be
negotiating million-dollar endorsement contracts. After all, Shaun
White, the nation's foremost 11-year-old snowboarder, has a
publicist _ a fact that is emblematic of how far extreme has
strayed.
</P>
<P>
   The genre of extreme sports takes its cues from early 1980s
California skate punk culture, which proved that you could still be
a gnarly athlete even if you had spiky green hair.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a progenitor of extreme, it is Jay Adams, an almost
mythic Venice Beach skate god who had a shaved head and a tattoo
that read ``Team Pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said in a magazine article that he smoked marijuana
voraciously, reveled in fistfighting and hopped fences to ride
empty swimming pools. But he rose to prominence at roughly the same
time as MTV, and it was inevitable that the rebel spirit he
exemplified would be co-opted.
</P>
<P>
   It happened finally in 1993, when Ron Semiao, the program
director for ESPN's hipper offshoot, ESPN2, stepped into a
stationery store looking for, as he described it, ``the Sports
Illustrated of extreme sports.'' To his surprise, there was no such
thing.
</P>
<P>
   But there were scores of specialty magazines catering to
everyone from health-conscious rock climbers to corn-dog-eating
skate rats.
</P>
<P>
   Semiao bought every one of the magazines, and then reflected
that AT&AMP;T, Old Spice deodorant and Ricoh copiers were all using
extreme sports images to advertise to twentysomething consumers. If
he could unify the magazines' myriad subcultures ``from the top
down,'' he thought he would strike gold. So he envisioned the X
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Semiao said he favors sports that ``have a whole culture
attached to them, a specific attitude and a group of people who
live and die for that sport.''
</P>
<P>
   He chose skiboarding, he said, because its 20,000 or so American
practitioners are strong rivals of snowboarders.
</P>
<P>
   But it was ESPN's treatment that made the sport sing to viewers.
The network's coverage in January was wonderful eye candy, a
spectacle replete with splashy graphics, lightning-quick interviews
and even stage direction: ESPN's producers had Mike Nick make his
first-ever attempt at a 1440, a quadruple aerial spin, on his last
run. The announcer crowed, ``Expect the spectacular!'' Nick whirled
and crashed.
</P>
<P>
   It was ESPN at its best. Even more than the Olympics, the X
Games are ultimately about theatrics and bathos. And in the spirit
of the best TV dramas, they deliver poignant moments.
</P>
<P>
   The X moment, as it might be called, is soul stirring yet
somehow subversive. At last summer's games, for instance, we saw
skateboarders thumping their boards axelike on a ramp as the fading
skate legend Tony Hawk twisted through what the announcers deemed
``the greatest run of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all enough to make skeptics like Kevin Thatcher feel sick.
Thatcher is the publisher of Thrasher, a San Francisco-based
skateboard magazine founded in 1981, and a friend of Jay Adams (who
has now retreated to Hawaii, where he repairs surfboards for a
living). He was invited to oversee the skateboarding contests at
the first X Games, but declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV flattens skateboarding into one big ad,'' he said. ``You
can't truly capture it unless you take the TV cameras away, close
off a street and just let the kids go at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher might be right, but he's not about to stop Semiao.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these insider magazines feel a moral obligation to
trash the X Games because ESPN is a large corporation,'' Semiao
said. ``But when I see more kids buying skateboards, and more
skaters doing ads for Pepsi and AT&AMP;T, I think, that's a good thing.
There's nothing wrong with it.''

   As of early January, Mike Nick was an unknown, just a stocky
21-year-old who could do crazy tricks like aerial spins and flips
on short, fat planks that resemble miniature snowboards. Then he
won the first-ever skiboarding contest at the winter X Games in
Crested Butte, Colo., and he was mobbed by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen ringed him slopeside, and the announcer for ESPN _ which

 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since 1926, when Dr. Robert H. Goddard, working in Auburn,
Mass., fired the world's first successful liquid-fueled rocket, the
field has developed along the same general lines. Increasingly big
and powerful vehicles have blasted off from dry land.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, these rockets have carried into space mainly
communication satellites, which beam telephone calls, beeper
messages, computer data and television and radio programs around
the world. Such work is booming. In the next decade, analysts say,
more than 1,000 new communication satellites are scheduled to be
sent into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a radical entry in the launching game is getting ready to
blast off after an investment of more than $500 million by
companies in Russia, Ukraine, Norway and the United States. The
team is joining inexpensive Russian and Ukrainian rocket gear with
U.S. marketing and technical savvy. Boeing Co., the U.S. aerospace
giant, owns 40 percent of the joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the team's rocket is to rise from a floating
platform in the Pacific and carry a communication satellite into
orbit _ a space-age first. The aim is big profits, and the
infrastructure is similarly big.
</P>
<P>
   The 660-foot control ship carries up to 240 people. The
launching platform is nearly as big as two football fields and
moves itself around at speeds of up to 12 knots. And the rocket
stands 20 stories tall.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Sea Launch, the venture, if successful, will be a
technical feat that significantly boosts the payload weight that a
rocket can carry by simply starting the trek in the right place.
</P>
<P>
   By blasting off at the Equator rather than the higher latitudes
where most spaceports are found, the rocket will get the maximum
possible boost from the earth's rotation and follow the shortest
possible route to an orbit 22,300 miles overhead. There,
communication satellites turn in step with the earth, making them
appear to hang motionless and easing linkups with ground antennas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to provide a low-cost alternative for launching
satellites,'' Jim Albaugh, the president of Boeing Space
Transportation, the U.S. parent of Sea Launch, said in an
interview. ``We get up to 30 percent more payload than launches
from North America or Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, the team's control ship (made in Scotland by the
Norwegian partner) left St. Petersburg, Russia (where a Ukrainian
rocket had been loaded and Russian rocket-handling gear installed),
and headed for Long Beach, Calif., site of the company's home port
(adapted from an old Navy base). The floating launch platform (made
in Norway from an oil rig) is being outfitted in Vyborg, Russia,
and is to sail for Long Beach this summer for the launching debut.
</P>
<P>
   Space experts say the venture has some risk. But they add that
the team and equipment are so strong that they will likely open a
major new pathway into the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very smart,'' said Marco Caceres, a space analyst at the
Teal Group, aerospace consultants based in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most rockets are launched out of government facilities, and
you have to wait your turn,'' at times for months or years, he
said. ``Here, they're taking a vehicle that's relatively modern,
getting it at a good price, taking it and launching it for a
venture they own'' at times they, rather than an outsider, decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they're getting in at the start of the market boom,''
Caceres added. ``The timing is perfect. They'll do very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Some arms-control advocates, as well as the Clinton
administration, which encouraged Sea Launch because it employs
Russian and Ukrainian rocket makers who otherwise might pitch their
wares and expertise to rogue states and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare that you find this kind of sweet technical fix to a
lot of policy problems,'' said John E. Pike, head of space policy
at the Federation of American Scientists, a private group in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The team's Ukrainian rocket is known as the Zenit. Its maker,
the Yuzhnoye design bureau and Yuzhmash production plant, once made
for Moscow the SS-18, which the Pentagon dubbed ``Satan.'' The
dreaded black giant was the Soviet Union's deadliest weapon, able
to deliver 10 or more nuclear warheads with great precision halfway
around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at
George Washington University, said Sea Launch was bittersweet for
national security because it diverted rather than eliminated the
threat. ``It keeps production lines open in the SS-18 plant,'' he
noted, ``but gives that cadre of people something to do other than
make SS-18s.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its merits for arms control, the private venture is
poised to challenge world rocketry. Each year this business sends
aloft scores of monsters belching fire and smoke _ the Proton from
Russia, the Long March from China, the H-2 from Japan, the Ariane
from French Guiana for the European Space Agency and the Delta and
Atlas from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its newcomer status, the Zenit rocket of Sea Launch has
already won top customers. Hughes Space and Communications, an
industry leader, has signed up for 13 launches, including the
first. That flight is to loft a five-ton craft meant to knit
Brazil, Mexico and the United States together electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Donald L. Cromer, the chairman of Hughes, which is based in
California, said the undisclosed Sea Launch price was ``very
competitive.'' He added that costs were further cut since Hughes
would be able to ship the spacecraft to the nearby home port of Sea
Launch rather than across the country to Cape Canaveral in Florida
or overseas to a foreign spaceport.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sea Launch has sold five additional Zenit launches to Loral
Space &AMP; Communications, headed by Bernard L. Schwartz, a top
individual contributor to the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Loral and Hughes have been caught in a political
firestorm over whether they acted improperly in helping the Chinese
fix problems in their inexpensive Long March rockets, and whether
their donations to the president and his party prompted the Clinton
administration to look the other way.
</P>
<P>
   With Sea Launch, the two companies are looking for a cheaper way
to get their satellites into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Albaugh, the Boeing official who oversees the U.S. side of Sea
Launch, said many other customers would doubtless join Loral and
Hughes as the Zenit proved itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got interest from a lot of satellite manufacturers,'' he
said in the interview. ``At the prices we can offer, I think we'll
see a big increase in orders after the first few years.''
</P>
<P>
   The boost that the rocket gets at the equator occurs because of
the earth's eastward rotation. At the North Pole, this speed is
zero. But it increases in a southward direction until, at the
equator, the surface of the earth is moving eastward at more than
1,000 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   To take advantage of this rotational kick, most rockets carrying
communication payloads are fired due east, if safety considerations
allow such a flight path.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the world's spaceports have slowly pushed southward
to take an increasingly large share of this free ride. The main
Russian base, from which the first satellite, Sputnik, flew aloft
in 1957, is located at 45.6 degrees northern latitude. Cape
Canaveral in Florida is 28.5 degrees. And the European Ariane site,
a mere 5.2 degrees above the Equator, was carved out of the jungles
of French Guiana on South America's northeast coast.
</P>
<P>
   But even at the Equator, the boost of 1,000 miles per hour is a
relatively modest aid since the velocity a rocket needs to get into
orbit is 17,500 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   For Sea Launch, an even bigger advantage comes because its
rockets will fly the shortest possible route to the high equatorial
orbit. In contrast, rockets flying out of, say, Cape Canaveral at
28.5 degrees north, must burn fuel (the added weight of which
reduces payload capacity) to nudge themselves down to the high
orbit aligned with the equator at 0 degrees latitude.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these enticements, the real driver behind the founding
of Sea Launch was the opportunity for new business that arose after
the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. By 1993, Boeing was deep in
discussions with the Energia company, a star of the Russian rocket
industry. The two judged that their skills were complementary.
</P>
<P>
   Amy L. Buhrig, head of Sea Launch marketing, said the two
companies ``worked closely with the Department of Commerce looking
for ways to work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideas came and went. The one that stuck was Sea Launch. Its
premise was that demand for satellite launchings would soon
outstrip the supply. Its trump card was to be the Zenit, a military
rocket that Moscow had used for launching a wide variety of spy
satellites.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1995, the joint venture was formed in the Cayman
Islands. Boeing owns 40 percent, RSC-Energia of Moscow 25 percent,
Kvaerner Maritime of Oslo, Norway, 20 percent, and KB Yuzhnoye and
PO Yuzhmash of Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine, 15 percent. Thought the
Zenit is considered Ukrainian, all its engines, a rocket's key
component, are made in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The venture has had some setbacks, none apparently serious. On
May 20, 1997, a Zenit flying out of Moscow's main spaceport failed
44 seconds after liftoff. Boeing swept in afterward to make sure
the rocket design was sound.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Buhrig, the Sea Launch marketing head, said the
investigating team included Loral, the satellite maker; Rocketdyne,
an arm of Boeing specializing in engines; and the Defense
Technology Security Administration, which helps guard military
secrets as American defense contractors increasingly work with
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that we were observers and concurred with
the findings of the Russian-Ukrainian investigation,'' Ms. Buhrig
said.
</P>
<P>
   The topic is politically sensitive because of Washington's
ongoing investigations into whether the aid Loral and Hughes gave
Chinese rocket makers helped China improve missiles laden with
nuclear warheads, thus endangering U.S. security.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, private experts say, there was probably little
chance of such aid because Russian and Ukrainian rockets in some
respects are superior to U.S. ones, especially their engines. In
fact, the Air Force recently selected a new rocket for launching
satellites whose engine is based on a Russian design.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have anything approaching Russian engine
technology,'' said Charles P. Vick, an expert on the Russian space
program at the Federation of American Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Governmental backing for Sea Launch is so strong that it
recently won loan guarantees from the World Bank after questions
were resolved about whether Sea Launch violated the bank's
prohibitions on aiding military activities. The bank will back
guarantees of $100 million each for Russia and the Ukraine, giving
investors some protection from economic, civil or military turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Though planning to work on the high seas where no nation holds
sway, the Sea Launch venture, by virtue of Boeing's participation,
still falls under Washington's watchful eye. The Transportation
Department says it must license any rocket launching, and the
Commerce Department says any U.S. satellite maker that wants to use
the Zenit must get an export license.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, Sea Launch will fire into space six
Zenits a year, though Albaugh of Boeing said the pace could be
quickened to eight. After the debut flight, rockets are to be
shipped in pieces from the Ukraine to Long Beach, loaded aboard the
command and assembly ship and integrated with the satellite
payload. The whole assembly will then be transferred to the
floating platform for blastoff.
</P>
<P>
   The platform itself is unanchored, instead using propellers to
maintain position in choppy seas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think there are any show stoppers,'' Albaugh said.
``It's a fascinating program and I'm amazed at the progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Buhrig of Sea Launch said company studies found that one
Zenit might fail catastrophically in every 11 flights. ``This is
very good for the beginning of a new product line,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the start, the company plans to move Zenits from the ship to
the launching platform only at the home port, which means that both
would have to jog back and forth from the Pacific launching site.
</P>
<P>
   But later, officials said, the launching platform might be left
in place at sea. This could save time, since the command and
assembly ship can move faster than the platform.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Buhrig said such a system would allow between 12 and 15
launchings a year, which would rival the rate of commercial
blastoffs at the world's busiest spaceports.
</P>
<P>
   Caceres of the Teal Group said the venture would likely prove to
be very successful and that talk of low pricing would evaporate as
Zenit rockets started flying out of Pacific waters with regularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd be foolish to give a discount,'' he said, ``because
there's a huge demand.''

JAMAICA SWEEPS OFF ITS WELCOME MAT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<P>
   More than a million tourists have visited Jamaica in each of the
past 10 years, and last year's visitor count soared to 1.9 million.
Much of that increase can be attributed to the growing number of
cruise ship passengers, including 700,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But tourism officials in Jamaica fear that the recent pervasive
harassment of visitors, which Prime Minister Percival Patterson
called the single biggest problem facing the island's tourist
industry, could put an end to a profitable source of income. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To forestall that possibility, last month, Jamaica increased
fines by a whopping 100-fold on those who badger and otherwise
harass tourists. Penalties for first-time offenders who badger
tourists to buy or barter for drugs, sex and merchandise were
raised to about $2,700 from $27, while fines for repeat offenders
were raised to about $4,100 from $41.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica also established night courts, making it possible for
law enforcement officers to appear in court without having to
abandon their beats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little too early to say how well the fines are working,
but we know we have a problem and we are determined to deal with
it,'' said Stephanie Belcher, executive director of the island's
Tourism Product Development Co., an arm of the government. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That observation was seconded by Karen Ford-Warner, director
general of the office of the prime minister for tourism, who is
nevertheless pleased by early anecdotal evidence. ``One cruise
director told us he had already seen a remarkable transformation in
the streets,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The recent no-nonsense crackdown follows a number of promised
crackdowns that were either quickly abandoned or whose fines were
negligible and thus ineffectual. But now the stakes are higher than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is by far Jamaica's biggest and most important industry,
accounting for 45 percent of its $595.1 million foreign exchange,
for 13.7 percent of its $6.2 billion gross domestic product and for
one in every four jobs. Those percentages are among the highest in
the Caribbean, a region that in turn is among the most heavily
dependent on tourism in the world.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Caribbean islands are increasingly competing with
Florida, Mexico and other warm-weather destinations for North
American tourists, who make up most of their visitors, including
about 60 percent in the case of Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   To add to Jamaica's woes, Canadian and European tourists have
recently discovered Cuba, whose desperation for dollars has
resulted in lower-priced vacation packages. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both the recent crackdown, and the harassment that led to it,
have been building for some time. After the winter season of
1996-97 four cruise lines threatened to pull out of Montego Bay
because of it, and Celebrity Cruises' Mercury did leave at the end
of last year, substituting the Mexican port of Calica in the
Yucatan peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   But Celebrity's Century still stops at Ocho Rios every two
weeks, as do other ships. Carnival Cruise Line ships continue to
call at Montego Bay and Ocho Rios. ``We have gotten complaints
about harassment,'' said Jennifer de la Cruz, a Carnival
spokeswoman, ``but not enough to negate our passengers' positive
experiences by calling at Jamaica.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But even the Tourism Product Development Co. reported that 56
percent of those who responded to a visitor satisfaction survey
last year said they were hassled to buy drugs, were followed,
badgered for sex or pushed into taxis _ not just at the docks, but
elsewhere, especially in shopping areas.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer anti-harassment teams arrested many pimps, illegal
taxi drivers and touts at the airports in Montego Bay and Kingston.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That sweep followed by one month the warning from Patterson that
``people are going to refuse to come to Jamaica, resulting in a
virtual collapse of the tourism industry because of harassment.''
He added that no matter how enjoyable the beaches, the views or the
music, if visitors are the subject of constant harassment, they
simply will not return. While most Jamaicans are hospitable, he
said, the ``miscreants'' had to be dealt with decisively, including
with stiff fines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One reason the higher fines were not levied before last month is
that the problem was widely thought to be a consequence of
unemployment, a result of Jamaica's declining sugar and banana
industries. Unemployment is still high _ 16.5 percent, according to
the Statistical Institute of Jamaica _ but the risk of driving away
tourists is now regarded as worse than the risks in cracking down.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, the government plans to invest about
$1 million to establish craft villages in the major resort towns of
Montego Bay, Ocho Rios, Negril and Port Antonio, and to provide
training in tourism-related job skills. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Belcher, for one, has no illusions that expenditures for
craft villages and for teaching job skills are a complete answer.
``You do have some hardened criminals who have no desire to hold
jobs,'' she said, ``but that's why we also increased the fines.''

MATHEMATICIANS PROVE THAT IT'S A SMALL WORLD
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By SANDRA BLAKESLEE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mathematicians have found a simple explanation for
how big worlds can be turned into small worlds, a phenomenon summed
up in the popular belief that anyone on earth can be linked to
anyone else by a chain of only six other people _ the so-called six
degrees of separation.
</P>
<P>
   Any large set of linked, dynamic components _ be they people,
electric power stations, brain cells or whatever _ can be
transformed into a small world, the mathematicians said, by
introducing short cuts between a few components. Relatively few
short cuts can make big changes in a network, linking clusters of
people, power stations or brain cells together in unexpected ways.
</P>
<P>
   Among people, the short cuts are well-connected individuals _
those who know many people from other countries, different
disciplines or unusual subcultures. Such highly connected people
establish surprising interconnections between groups that seem
impossibly distant from one another, like Iowa farmers and Kalahari
bushmen. For example, sometimes a farmer's son will join the Peace
Corps in Africa and thus unexpected links are born.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of interconnectedness is familiar to social animals
like humans but now, for the first time, mathematicians have
quantified it in a general model.
</P>
<P>
   The finding, which is the first mathematical explanation of the
small world phenomenon in dynamical systems, was reported in the
June 4 issue of the journal Nature. The mathematical experiments
were done by Steven Strogatz, a mathematician at Cornell
University, and Duncan Watts, a postdoctoral fellow in the social
sciences at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have made a great contribution to understanding small
world effects,'' said James Collins, a mathematician at the Center
for Biodynamics at Boston University. ``The phenomenon has been
mostly studied by sociologists and psychologists, but the
mathematics community had not explored these networks in terms of
self-organizing systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Such systems include social networks, technologies like the
Internet and electric power grids, and life in general _ the fact
that a sperm can penetrate an egg and set into play a series of
biological processes that give rise to complex creatures from mere
specks of protoplasm.
</P>
<P>
   The finding that short cuts make all the difference explains why
total strangers can quickly determine that they have acquaintances
in common, why epidemics spread so rapidly in the modern world and
may be useful in improving communication systems like cellular
telephones and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a unifying mechanism in nature that makes things small
and interconnected,'' Strogatz said.
</P>
<P>
   But could it be modeled mathematically? To find out, the
researchers focused attention on two extreme types of networks. One
is a simple geometric lattice in the shape of a ring, with each
node connected locally to its neighbors. Like a pure crystal, this
lattice is highly ordered. The distance from one node to the next
is characteristically long, and nodes tend to cluster tightly in
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The second model is a ringed lattice with the nodes connected
randomly. The distance from one node to the next is
characteristically shorter, but because everything is connected
helter-skelter, there is very little order and nodes do not fall
into common clusters.
</P>
<P>
   Most biological, technological and social networks lie between
these two extremes of ordered versus random connections. ``We
asked, what would happen if you take an ordered lattice and rewire
some of the nodes, introducing short cuts?'' Watts said. ``You'd be
making a regular network slightly more random by connecting nodes
that would not normally be connected.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a regular network each node is connected only to
its immediate neighbors _ like people in a rural village who rarely
leave home and only know the people next door. But if one of those
villagers travels to the big city, adding one distant link to all
the close links at home, the village is connected to the wider
world.
</P>
<P>
   The results were astonishing, Watts said. The properties of the
lattice change dramatically. It still forms clusters, but the
pathways between clusters are much shorter. Immediate neighborhoods
and more distant neighborhoods are suddenly closer together.
Information spreads more quickly. Each node has access to more
information and can do more things. In being connected to more
neighbors, nodes begin to cooperate and synchronize.
</P>
<P>
   The huge surprise is that it takes very few short cuts between
nodes and clusters to turn a big world into a small world, Watts
said. After a point, adding more short cuts does not improve
network efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   To find out if their abstract mathematical model applied to the
real world, the researchers looked at three systems whose elements
have been mapped completely _ the power transmission grid of the
western United States, the 282 neurons that make up the nervous
system of a simple worm called Caenorhabditis elegans, and the
nearly 250,000 actors listed in the Internet Movie Database.
</P>
<P>
   Each is a small world whose elements are closely connected to
neighboring elements _ one power station to the next, one cell to
another and one actor to another actor who tends to be cast in the
same kind of films, Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   Such worlds could be random but they are not. They have a great
deal of structure, which is created by short cuts between a few
power stations, a few special cells in the nervous system or
certain prominent actors who make a lot of movies, Watts said.
These short cuts can be identified and measured, which means that
they act as a unifying principle for small worlds in general.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The finding of what difference a few short cuts can make has
radical implications for people, Watts said. Most people know only
their immediate neighbors and friends but a few people are
well-connected. They cross geographic, social and political
boundaries and make the world seem smaller.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you knew Secretary of State Madeline Albright,
you would be connected to everyone she knows, including kings and
queens. But even if you are not her friend, you may be connected to
her indirectly. Perhaps your neighbor's daughter-in-law was Ms.
Albright's college roommate. If so, you would be connected to the
Queen of England by three degrees of separation.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that all people are connected through indirect
networks was first studied by the Stanley Milgram, a social
psychologist at Harvard University who in 1967 asked people in
Nebraska and Kansas to mail a letter to two people in Boston with
whom they were not acquainted. They were to forward the letter to
friends who might know the Boston people.
</P>
<P>
   The average number of intermediaries between the Midwesterners
and the Bostonians was six, a finding that was popularized in the
1990 in the play ``Six Degrees of Separation,'' by John Guare. The
play and a subsequent movie were based on the notion that everyone
in the world is connected to everyone else through a chain of at
most six acquaintances. If two people have one mutual acquaintance
they have one degree of separation. Subsequent degrees of
separation are based on the number of people needed to make the
link.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, college students embraced a game called ``Six
Degrees of Kevin Bacon,'' in which they linked the actor to other
actors through as few links as possible. The Oracle of Bacon at
Virginia, a Web site created by Brett Tjaden, now links 322,095
actors to Bacon, assigning each a Bacon score. Because Bacon has
appeared in so many films, most actors have low Bacon scores.
</P>
<P>
   The game can also be played with a relative newcomer like
Leonardo DiCaprio. For example, DiCaprio was in ``Les Cent et Une
Nuits'' (1995) with Harrison Ford, who was in ``Apocalypse Now''
(1979) with Marlon Brando, who was in ``Countess from Hong Kong''
(1967) with Charlie Chaplin. Thus, Chaplin has a DiCaprio score of
three.
</P>
<P>
   Short cuts can have positive or negative effects on society,
Watts said. When human populations were isolated centuries ago,
disease epidemics would be localized. But add jet travel _ a short
cut _ and the world becomes smaller. Many experts believe that AIDS
was first spread to the United States from Africa through an
infected airline attendant who introduced the virus into gay
bathhouses in New York. ``Infectious diseases spread more quickly
and easily in a small world, and it is alarming how few short cuts
are needed to make the world small,'' Strogatz said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, short cuts can make networks more efficient.
One might improve the efficiency of cell phone networks by
deliberately introducing a few random connections between nodes, or
phones, Collins said. That alone might improve traffic flow without
building new relay stations. Similarly, one might improve the flow
of information through the Internet by introducing a few random
links between backbone computers on the Internet, he said. That
might reduce the time needed to send e-mail or to find a Web site.

<P>
   &UR; BOSNIA-NATO (S &LR; kopje &UR; , Macedonia) &LR;  _ With conflict in
separatist Kosovo Province intensifying, and diplomats fear, likely
to spread to other Balkan countries, the West has threatened the
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, with air strikes unless he
stops the stop using military force against civilians and enters
serious negotiations. To make that message clear more than 80 NATO
warplanes lifted off from 15 European bases Monday morning,
coursing across the skies over the Adriatic Sea and Albania and
Macedonia. &UR;  &LR; By Mike O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHINA-BULLS FEVER  &LR; (Beijing) _ It was class time at Beijing
University, but at 10 this morning seven guys in shorts and
T-shirts crowded around a large-screen color TV in dorm room 511, a
spare cement cubicle decorated with three metal bunkbeds and
yesterday's laundry. Nine student ``shareholders'' had bought the
TV last month in anticipation of just such an occasion and now
hoots and jeers filled the air as they watched the Chicago Bulls
clinched their sixth National Basketball Association championship
half a world away. &UR;  &LR; By Elizabeth Rosenthal.  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON (Coded w) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SCOTUS-CLIENT  &LR; (Washington) _ The Supreme Court, by the
narrowest of margins, endangered multistate programs that for two
decades have provided the nation's poor with up to $100 million
worth of free legal help each year. Voting 5-4 in a Texas case, the
justices ruled Monday that the interest earned from short-term
trust accounts lawyers hold for their clients are the private
property of those clients.

 &LR;   &UR; TEEN-GAMBLING  &LR; (Atlantic City, N.J.) _ Gambling and its

   &UR; LOTT-RELIGION &LR;  (Washington) &UR;  &LR; _ In an unusual television
interview exploring his personal and religious beliefs, Sen. Trent
Lott agreed with a conservative talk show host that homosexuality
is a sin and he compared it to such personal problems as
alcoholism, kleptomania and ``sex addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINANCIAL (Coded f)  &LR;   &UR; SUNBEAM-DUNLAP  &LR; (Undated) _ America's
leading corporate downsizer has just been downsized. Albert Dunlap,
the publicity-seeking chief executive who took almost perverse
pride in throwing thousands of people out of work in the name of
raising his company's stock price was thrown out of his own job as
chief executive of the Sunbeam Corp. over the weekend. The
self-proclaimed turnaround artist, who had been running the company
for almost two years, was dismissed by a board in a revolt led by
some of his hand-picked directors.

BEAUTY AND THE BEASTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Olympic Club is the most beautiful golf
course in the history of the world. Trees that kiss the sky, greens
like God's gardener did the work, fairways like the best mattress
you ever slept on, sand straight from the lobby ash trays at the
Ritz-Carlton. Makes Augusta National look like a goat's diner,
right?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, that's what the brochure says, and it would be unkind to
quibble now that everyone is here and ready to party.
</P>
<P>
   For the next week, though, the Olympic Club won't be heaven on
Earth but a U.S. Open course, which means it will be a mean,
vicious, hateful old orchard, knocking millionaires who own their
own jets and the pilots who fly them off their Foot-Joys and onto
their backs like starving turtles.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if the USGA has properly done its job, and we are sure
they have. At least as far as it goes.
</P>
<P>
   You see, this isn't just the U.S. Open. This is San Francisco's
U.S. Open, and although that might not mean much to David Eger,
Phil Mickelson or Jumbo Ozaki, it means plenty to us, the most
self-absorbed people in the history of the world. And yes, that's
in the brochure, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Club could have been tarted up not only to reflect
the USGA's more sadistic side but San Francisco's tourist needs as
well. Our guests would still be fighting to break par while they
would also be getting the full flavor of our hospitality. And we
are talking hospitality well beyond our usual summer weather _
traditionally night and morning raining crud, with afternoon wind
gusts of between 10 and 340 mph. Especially if the local
meteorological genii tell us it's going to be 74 and glorious.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, no reason why the USGA, while making sure
the fairways were 4 feet wide and the roughs filled with sinkholes
and puff adders, could not have put at the first tee a tape loop of
Mayor Willie Brown arguing with state Sen. Quentin Kopp about the
true value of the borsalino in politics. There isn't a golfer in
the PGA (or, for that matter, a human being with ears) whose nerves
wouldn't be so jangled that his drive would hit the pro shop on the
bounce.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA could have agreed to put a hot table from any of our
finer restaurants at the tee on No. 5, and made a brief nosh one of
the rules. If you think for 15 seconds that Fred Couples could put
down a single calamari or pickled pig's knuckle from Caesar's
without losing the entire equilibrium of his swing, you order your
dinner through an intercom. ``Well, I know I shot an 83,'' Couples
would say, ``but I've never eaten better in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Masters has Amen Corner. We could have Hell's Big Bend _ a
combination Gay Freedom Day parade, the line outside Pat O'Shea's
on St. Patty's Eve and any Tenderloin corner on a Saturday night,
thrashing the day away behind the 12th hole and 13th tee. You think
some stately creek eating golf balls every 15 minutes has anything
on that? Don't even start.
</P>
<P>
   And what's a rough without a little local flavor? Poison oak?
Too generic. Bear traps? Hey, this isn't Montana. No, what we need
is the alligator that terrorized all those TV camera crews in
Mountain Lake Park a couple of years ago. Sure, he was only 3 or 4
feet long, but he could still snap off an ankle here and there and
spit out the spikes without losing his smile. If you think Casey
Martin needed an exemption for his serious leg problems, what about
the first poor dupe who has to hop around the course for the last
three days?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Mr. Martin, good luck to him, but this being the
Open and all, you ever hear of the ol' Denver Boot? The meter
fiends who tour North Beach with citations galore and wear the
smile of a hundred papered windshields and a job well done all day
long? How about some of those backward-facing iron spikes that blow
holes in tires, or better yet, having to pay to park his cart at
the daily rate in the Embarcadero garage? His concentration would
probably be jarred a hair or two, which is precisely what our USGA
comrades are looking for, yes?
</P>
<P>
   None of this is actually sporting, mind you, and since the
USGA's creativity extends only so far (there was talk in the
preliminary stages about having no holes at all on Nos. 7, 12 and
16), we are saddened to report that none of these local additives
will be included this week. The Olympic Club, all 6,800 yards of
her, will have to stand on its own, dealing out every bit of
frontier justice her groundskeepers can manage.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is a proud little burg, though. No golfer worthy
of the name will sit in his room for a whole week thinking about
the break on No. 8, and slapping a new grip on his wedge, or even
coordinating his wardrobe differently. Claustrophobia does not make
for good golf any more than lining up a putt while someone has put
a pot over your head and pounds it with a metal ladle.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, every golfer in the field has to come out and
eat, and hobnob with the locals, and schmooze over an adult
beverage in an adult restaurant with adults who have lived here
most of their adult lives.
</P>
<P>
   And that's when we've got them. We can't trick up the golf
course to reflect the city, but we can haul out the city and make
it reflect itself on the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   The clubs and shoes they choose are their own, but for the next
week, their stomachs and livers are ours. Welcome, gents, and watch
yourselves. We are everywhere.

'80S SURVIVORS, THE B52S, RETURN WITH A HAPPY SUMMER SOUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing; originally moved May 29)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it time yet?
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Wilson, one of the B-52's three singers-front folks, waves
a figurative finger in the wind. ``I think,'' she says, ``it might
be the right mood this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   For dancin'? Romancin'? Embracin' the essence of the silly
season? Could be. Surveys show we're a shiny happy country -- the
economy's good; there's no war; the crime rate's down. The new wave
music of the early '80s has bubbled up again (in ``The Wedding
Singer'' soundtrack among other places), and the reconstituted,
rejuvenated B-52's are primed to ride yet another wave.
</P>
<P>
   But must you go away for so long in order for the public to miss
you?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely. I mean, I had to get away,'' says a chipper
Wilson, on the phone. ``I could imagine even the fans had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Absent for six years, the B-52's are back.
</P>
<P>
   The B-52's defined hip-kitsch summer culture of the late
1970s-early 1980s -- as much a part of that era as the Beach Boys
were of the mid-1960s. ``Baked potatoes, bakin' in the sun!''
exclaimed ecstatic singer Fred Schneider in the B's
double-entendre-laden, sexy-silly first hit, ``Rock Lobster.'' On
their debut album, they took a zany place in outer space (``Planet
Claire''); later they invited us to the ``Party Out of Bounds,''
then they took us to the ``Love Shack.''
</P>
<P>
   The B-52's are calling their current swing through America's
outdoor amphitheaters the ``Time Capsule Tour.'' Their album is
``Time Capsule: Songs for a Future Generation,'' an 18-track
best-of collection with hits like ``Rock Lobster,'' ``Roam,'' and
``Love Shack,'' plus two new tunes, ``Debbie'' and ``Hallucinating
Pluto.''
</P>
<P>
   The B-52's -- Athens, Ga.'s favorite dance-crazed, sex-role
blurring sons and daughters in the pre-R.E.M. era -- had one
improbable comeback in 1989 with ``Cosmic Thing.'' Could they,
perhaps, rise from dormancy once again? Can boomer parents and
their teenage kids both do the Camel Walk to the B-52's of '98?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still dancing, thank God,'' says Wilson, who shares and
swaps vocals with fellow co-founders Kate Pierson and Schneider.
``Thank God'' is not idle chat; her brother, guitarist-songwriter
Ricky Wilson, died from AIDS in 1985. ``When you come to the show,
you're going to have to get up,'' says Wilson. ``We've got these
go-go cages . . . `` Select fans will get the chance to shimmer and
shine in those cages.
</P>
<P>
   OK, but are the B-52's still relevant?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's a good question,'' Wilson says. ``I don't know,
exactly, but if dancing and having a good time is irrelevant, then
I think that's terrible.
</P>
<P>
   But, yes, people want to hear our songs, and I think it's been
long enough where it will be fun and fresh again.'' Keep in mind,
too, that the B-52's lace their retro-futurist pop with
pro-environmental, humanistic concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, basically, it doesn't take much for us to want to get
back together,'' Wilson adds. ``But you have to have a reason and,
to be honest, money was the first reason. And perfectly cool. But I
think it went beyond that to actually be -- for me and I suspect
everybody else -- a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, let Wilson take you back to the early days, 1978,
when the campy, wide-eyed B-52's crashed the dingy, but hip, New
York punk scene and found the jaded punks too fashionably
disaffected to dance. The B's were miffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hurrah's show,'' says Wilson, mentioning a famed,
long-defunct club, ``that's when I knew something was going on,
right after (the single) `52 Girls.' That's what spread the news,
for us becoming a . . . thing. It was going to be a regular show
and we looked out the window and there was a line around the block.
We flipped out. Bells rang. Things were happening. This was the
moment for me. It's funny 'cause I remember Ricky just freaking out
and getting so nervous. He lost it that night. . . . I cherish the
old days, when it was fun and small.''
</P>
<P>
   But the B-52's of today -- with former drummer Keith Strickland
taking over Ricky's guitarist slot -- are a bigger, if more
nebulous, entity. Session players and pals -- bassist Tracy
Wormworth, drummer Charlie Drayden, keyboardist Pat Irwin -- flesh
out the band.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plateaus,'' says Wilson, looking back on the B's.
``For any musician, any rocker. It's just what you go through.
There were pitfalls and changes -- some exciting changes. `Cosmic
Thing' was a blessing. We went from the small band to the big band.
And not having Ricky behind me was really scary . . . I didn't
think I could live without Ricky.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy dropped out of the B's after the ``Cosmic Thing'' tour.
She wanted to go out on a high note; she wanted to have a baby,
move from New York back to Georgia. She admits, ``I was kind of
burnt out. And there were a few squabbles in the band. I wasn't
having as much fun. In rock 'n' roll, it's crucial, for me anyway,
to have fun.'' Wilson gave the band a year's notice and was
replaced by Julee Cruise, who toured with the B's in 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson came back to the fold, she says, in a casual manner. She
began to jam with the band. The time seemed right. They did some
corporate gigs -- that is, accepting big bucks to play conventions
for private companies and their employees -- and ``it was kind of
like us getting used to doing it. It unified us, to where we had a
goal. Now all the other stuff is falling in.''
</P>
<P>
   The B-52's are implicitly asking you to decide: What is
timeless, classic?
</P>
<P>
   What is faded, dated? Is a kitsch sensibility and a fascination
with creatures from outer space pop-worthy?
</P>
<P>
   ``We never lost that,'' says Wilson, of their fixations. Of
their serio-comic weave -- causes and a rock beat, she adds,
``One's just the style of the band and, I guess, one's just your
conscience, what you believe. I never had a problem with mixing,
never thought it was a problem. Human beings are multilayered and
nobody's a cartoon. It's a moment of time, basically.''

A SHAMELESSLY SUPERFICIAL `REAL WORLD' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE REAL WORLD 
On: MTV 
Time: Tuesday night at 10 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even with its he-said-she-said gender wars and its racial
tensions, MTV's ``The Real World'' has always been about as real as
summer camp. And as it begins its seventh season, which is set in
the alternative-rock mecca of Seattle, the infamous documentary
series now appears to be aiming for new heights of unreality, not
least of all thanks to the spiffy rock-climbing wall in the
apartment's living room.
</P>
<P>
   What's different about the show this year is that it no longer
seems interested in cultivating even a veneer of serious
documentary, pretending to be some sort of anthropological profile
of the nose-ring generation and its pressing issues. The game is up
in Seattle, with the cast members even talking openly about the
fact that ``The Real World'' is the best star-making machinery this
side of a Miramax movie. After a few minutes of set-up time, a
shamelessly light, playful atmosphere takes hold of the show and
finds our seven roomies quickly digging into the Seattle nightclub
scene and some randy pillow fighting.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, the ``Real World'' apartments have been quite hip
and showy. But this year's space, on Pier 70 on Elliott Bay, is in
a league of its own in terms of fantasy living. The palatial
interior is wide open and laid out like a TV set, with donated art
works and funky gimmicks all around, including hand-carved beds, a
barking metal-bulldog doorbell, an aquarium, a library of books
(including, of course, ``Sex for Dummies,'' which is quickly given
a public reading), a hot tub, a pool table, and an exercise room.
In a surreal touch, the cast members drink coffee (of course) out
of oversized cups, making them appear as though they only just fell
through a looking glass.
</P>
<P>
   Also, forget about last year's attempt, with the Boston cast, to
add a conscience to ``The Real World'' by making the gang work for
a children's after-school program. This year they are employed at a
commercial, alternative-rock radio station, where they will be able
to contemplate their hazy millennial futures in the company of some
pretty cool music-world celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the hourlong season premiere, which airs tonight at 10,
this year's cast is as TV-friendly as their apartment and their
jobs. Each person is instantly vivid in a way that has been missing
from the series since the third and best season, in San Francisco.
By the end of the first episode, you can easily remember each of
their names. And while this is Seattle, none of the cast members
seems to be caught up in any arch grunge or neo-Beat or
hipper-than-thou attitudes _ if anything, they're a surprisingly
wholesome bunch. (Don't they watch MTV?!)
</P>
<P>
   Two of the men, Nathan and David, are already best buds, as
fellow students at the Virginia Miliary Institute in Virginia.
David is a native of our own Charlestown, where he narrowly escaped
street violence and drug abuse, and with his Boston accent, his
class consciousness, and his loyalty to Nathan, he brings a welcome
dash of ``Good Will Hunting'' to the show. Not surprisingly, David
and Nathan's bond makes the third man, Stephen, feel excluded and
betrayed. Stephen, who appears to be moody and prickly, is
something of a diversity windfall for the makers of the show, as he
is both African-American and Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   The women immediately pair off, with Janet and Lindsay
distinguishing themselves as the resident extroverts, sometimes
even hugging their new roommates upon first meeting. Lindsay is on
the fast track to winning the most annoying award, bringing every
conversation around to sex and divisively trying to turn Janet
against the other two women. With Janet, who keeps yelling ``Shut
(itals)up(unitals)'' when she gets unbelievably excited, Lindsay
raids the boys' bedroom and jumps on top of David, who
automatically pulls off his T-shirt for some fun. She's either very
hot-to-trot or bristling with misplaced anger. The other two women
are less attention-getting, but potentially interesting. Rebecca is
graceful and intellectual, and Irene is a witty joker who
reportedly will not finish the season on the show.
</P>
<P>
   After last season's drabness and hostility in Boston, Seattle
promises to be fun city. And when all is said and done, why act as
though ``The Real World'' is anything other than a respite from its
title?

PRAGUE: THE IMMERSION COURSE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Outside the window, the sun was smiling on one of the world's
most beautiful cities. It was early September in Prague, a warm and
pleasant Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Old Town Square was filled with tourists snapping
pictures. The outdoor cafes would be crowded with people sipping
coffee, waiting for the Town Hall's 15th-century Astronomical Clock
to reveal, every hour on the hour, a little tableau of a skeletal
Death ringing a bell as 12 medieval carved apostles emerged from
two windows. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But I was sitting in a third-floor room at Charles University,
listening to Peter Griffin, a Cambridge-trained historian. Griffin,
whose red sports jacket and paisley tie were cloaked in the black
gown of a proper don, paced back and forth, stopping now and again
to lean forward on the lectern. ``There were five separate crusades
before 1431 sent to destroy the Taborites,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, I had no desire to escape the classroom for the cafe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before I arrived in Prague for my weeklong University Vacations
tour late last summer, I had never heard of the Taborites, and
didn't seem to suffer for it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And just the day before, as I jogged along the Vltava River at
dawn, I had been thinking about a break from the program. The day,
like today, was gorgeous and suddenly the prospect of spending even
part of the afternoon on a slow-motion bus tour, as the program
promised, seemed depressing.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to walk through the city, hear its sounds, smell its
aromas. I wanted to see the museums of the National Gallery and the
spectacular library in the Strahov Monastery and many other things
that were not on the agenda. Why had I signed up for this expensive
excursion in group travel? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But before the second day of classes were over, I had changed my
mind. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Griffin is a compelling lecturer, with rich, if convoluted,
material to plow through in a course called Prague: The Jewel of
Bohemia. I realized that I could probably participate fully and
still see much of what I wanted to, my way. University Vacations
schedules long lunches and breaks that I filled with walks and
gallery visits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before this trip, I had never taken a group tour. But last July,
without summer vacation plans, I found myself leafing through a
brochure I had saved from Miami-based University Vacations. Its
weeklong programs in history and culture at European universities
intrigued me, as did Prague, with its enchanting castle on the
hill, Baroque churches, bustling squares and narrow cobbled
streets.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewel of Bohemia tour promised an examination of Prague's
golden age, which ran from the 14th century (under Charles IV, who
in 1348 founded Charles University, the site of the program) to the
early 18th century. Despite my reservations _ mostly, I feared
being the only baby boomer in a group of retirees _ I signed up.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 31, I arrived in Prague before 10 a.m. and took a taxi
to the hotel that the group's participants were staying at: the
four-star Hotel Pariz, a heavily restored neo-Gothic and Art
Nouveau landmark built in 1907 in Old Town, near the 500-year-old
Powder Tower. My single room, comfortable though not luxurious, was
ready. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``School'' was to begin with a 7 p.m. reception, and when I
ventured down to the bar shortly after the hour, I got mixed omens.
There were only nine participants (18 to 24 was normal, I was told)
and seven of those were retirees.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, six of the nine were repeat University
Vacationers _ and Barry Caswell Brooks, the program director;
Griffin and Renata Blazkova, the local tour guide, were my age or
younger. Everyone was friendly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour later we all walked to the Golden Well restaurant,
where a private room with a big round table and carved Gothic
chairs awaited us. Conversation soon outgrew its initial
awkwardness. Although the reasonably good dinner, ordered ahead _
venison pate with lingonberries, stuffed turkey, strudel, ice
cream, berries and Greek wine _ ran past 10 p.m., the night was so
beautiful that we all walked halfway across the crowded Charles
Bridge for a view of the Castle, Prague's signature for more than
1,000 years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, my routine for the week took shape: up for a jog at 6
a.m., buffet breakfast in the hotel restaurant and a five-minute
walk to the university. Lectures began at 9:30 and ran until 10:30,
followed by a break in Old Town Square, resuming from 11:15 to
12:30.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of each, we could ask questions _ though we often
saved them for dinner discussions. After lunch, there were walking
tours or excursions (optional, like every other part of the
program), followed by dinner _ usually at quite good restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   On two nights, opera tickets had been arranged, but the group
elected to attend the first acts only of ``La Traviata'' at the
State Opera House and ``Don Giovanni'' at the Estates Theater. The
performances were fine, and these sumptuously decorated Baroque
theaters _ one in red, the other in powder blue _ were a sight to
behold, but we were unwilling to eat dinner late. No one was
coerced to leave, but we all did, and I was a willing conspirator. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There were some variations, of course. But basically it was
Prague in history in the morning, Prague in reality in the
afternoon, and Prague in discussion at dinner. The week was over in
no time, long before the subject was exhausted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our high-ceilinged classroom, on the third floor of the
Karolinum (the oldest part of Charles University), was more the
spare but elegant conference room than traditional classroom. It
was furnished with stuffed leather chairs, a U-shaped conference
table, a few 19th-century portraits and a gilded chandelier. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just after our first break, Jan Havranek, a professor of modern
Czech history, arrived to lead us through the 14th-century main
hall and the vault room, where the university stores its scepters,
academic gowns and other symbols of power. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Soon we were in the archives _ rare for nonscholars _ treated to
a look at medieval religious books and manuscripts (some on
vellum), faculty and graduate rolls and dissertations dating from
the 15th century. Many were hand-written but utilitarian scripts
(not decorative).
</P>
<P>
   We also examined the 1402 document appointing Jan Hus custodian
of Bethlehem chapel. From its pulpit, Hus launched a revolution
that challenged the Bohemian church-state hierarchy, helped define
the future Czech nation and foreshadowed by a century the
Protestant Reformation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Before Jan Hus, though, there was Charles IV and the Black
Death, the bubonic plague brought here from China by 14th-century
rats. Combined with a separate plague of septicemia (or blood
poisoning), the Black Death wiped out at least two-thirds of
Bohemia's population in 18 months, setting the stage for Charles IV
to rejuvenate the church, sponsor German immigration into Bohemia
and revamp the social structure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the popular Charles, the feudal system worked. But his heirs
were weak, explained Griffin. People rebelled, and Bohemia bounced
for hundreds of years among the Hussites (who had a more radical
wing, the Taborites), the Hapsburgs, home-grown rulers and kings of
Poland and Sweden, with religious and political infighting galore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther, St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, John Wycliffe,
Frederick the Wise, John Calvin and Henry VIII were among the many
who made appearances in Griffin's lectures. Indeed, by the middle
of the program, the drama was so laden with names and dates that it
was very hard to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed, I asked Griffin how the course compared with what
he teaches university students. We had, he replied, eight hours of
lectures to cover a period that takes six weeks in a European
history course. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But no matter. From his compressed lectures, I gleaned a frame
of reference for the Czech Republic, as well as a reminder of the
turbulence of European history. And by then, our afternoon
excursions were a big attraction.
</P>
<P>
   One day we took a comfortable bus ride to Kutna Hora, a pretty
little medieval silver-mining town about an hour east of Prague. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kutna Hora twice played a role in history. In 1409, fighting
university factions here agreed to a voting system that essentially
elevated Jan Hus to the powerful post of rector. Then, in 1471, the
Polish king Vladislav II Jagiello was elected king of Bohemia here.
</P>
<P>
   The bus stopped at St. Barbara's, a Gothic cathedral begun in
1388 that, aside from some beautiful murals, is spare inside.
Outside, however, it boasts outstanding outsized flying buttresses.
From there, it was a short walk down a narrow cobblestone road into
town, where pastel-painted shops form the main square. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kutna Hora is uncannily, almost disturbingly quiet. While the
others ate lunch in the local hotel, I poked around the mostly
deserted square. Later, I found a park with a spectacular view of
the valley below.
</P>
<P>
   When the others rejoined me, we headed for the Italian Court,
which was built as a royal seat and the royal mint. We stopped
briefly to gaze at the old coins in the treasury, but the main
attraction here is Audience Hall, where two stunning early
20th-century murals depict Jan Hus' and Vladislav II's dates with
history in Kutna Hora.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friday's excursion to Karlstejn Castle, about 20 miles outside
Prague, was even better. Our coach wended its way up and down
through wheatfields and orchards, past little villages of houses
with red-tile roofs.
</P>
<P>
   Karlstejn, built high on a cliff in the 14th century to house
the Holy Roman Empire's crown jewels, is on five levels. It was
designed on the theory that attackers would never get to the Chapel
of the Holy Cross at the top, where the jewels were.
</P>
<P>
   Though Swedish troops got close in the 16th century, they didn't
succeed. Today, most tourists don't have access to the gilt and
jewel-encrusted murals of the chapel, either _ but we were an
exception. In contrast with the stripped royal staterooms and
bedrooms below _ which I found disappointing _ the chapel was a
shining jewel box. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps to make up for a Dvorak concert that had been canceled
on our second night (no one knew why, including Brooks, the program
director), the farewell cocktail reception was switched from the
hotel bar to a surprise location. And the Hanavsky Pavilion, a
sparkling restaurant with an open terrace perched above the river
in Prague's Castle District, provided a panorama of the city, made
all the better by the champagne and tasty crab and ham hors
d'oeuvres.
</P>
<P>
   From there, we went on to what was probably our best meal:
smoked trout, rack of lamb and apple strudel at U Maliru
restaurant. All of us were now old friends, and the conversation
flowed as freely as the wine and after-dinner drinks. Melancholy
came over us briefly at the impending end of the week; only
Saturday's buffet breakfast was left (though I stayed an extra
day). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Months later, do I recall much Czech history? In all honesty,
no. The lectures went far deeper into politics than I would have
chosen, with little on art, music and culture of the age. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And yet, I remember a very pleasant time in Prague, entailing
much more mind-stretching than any lazy, oh-so-common beach trip
could possible provide. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you go &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year University Vacations' Prague: The Jewel of Bohemia
program runs from Aug. 30 through Sept. 5. The cost is $3,175 a
person, double occupancy, $3,375 single, with all breakfasts and
dinners; air fare is extra. It will again be led by Peter Griffin,
assisted by Professor Jan Havranek. Information: University
Vacations, Writers' Corner, 3660 Bougainvillea Road, Coconut Grove,
Fla. 33133; (800) 792-0100.
</P>
<P>
   University Vacations offers programs in several cities each
year, generally from May through September. Among the others this
year are ones in Budapest Sept. 6 to 12 and Bologna Sept. 13 to 19,
and a program on Winston Churchill at Oxford Aug. 16 to 22.
</P>
<P>
   Costs vary but are substantially lower at Oxford and Cambridge,
where participants are housed in single-occupancy college rooms.
The Churchill program, for example, costs $1,945 a person.
</P>
<P>
   In Prague, participants stay at the Pariz, a family-owned hotel
that was renovated recently. My room was smallish, dominated by the
bed, but its high ceilings, thick deep-blue carpet and Art Nouveau
decor gave it a certain elegance. And it came with a spacious
modern bathroom, a desk and work area, a television with several
English-language cable stations and plenty of closet space.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Pariz is on the edge of Old Town at 1 U Obecniho Domu,
(420-2) 24-22-21-51, fax (420-2) 24-22-54-75. It has 93 rooms and
suites for $240 to $260.

SONY INTRODUCES A MUST-SEE LAPTOP
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By STEPHEN MANES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over the years, a few portable computers have managed
to bring sighs of envy from onlookers. The original Radio Shack
Model 100 may have been homely, but at a time when stashing a
computer in a briefcase was unheard of, it drew crowds in public
places. The original Apple Powerbooks positively exuded cachet. The
expanding ``butterfly'' keyboard of the IBM 701C forced users to
offer impromptu demonstrations; the company's svelte black 560
models still turn heads.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the newest attention-grabber. The Sony VAIO 505G is less
than one inch thick and weighs just under three pounds. It takes
its slimness as seriously as a fashion model, and its industrial
design is the stuff awards are made of. The silvery rugged
magnesium alloy case has a lavender, or ``VAIO-let,'' tint. The
battery, a dark silvery-purple plastic cylinder, fits on the back
edge between the hinges. Its roundness adds a touch of whimsy
vaguely reminiscent of the new Volkswagen Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   This Windows computer is not much bigger than a computer
magazine. The bright, sharp, 10.4-inch active-matrix screen shares
the 800 by 600 pixel resolution of the IBM 560 line, but its
smaller size gives it a better chance of being useful in coach
class seats.
</P>
<P>
   The VAIO also comes with a 200-megahertz Pentium MMX processor,
32 megabytes of random access memory, 256 kilobytes of level 2
cache, a 2.1-gigabyte hard disk and a built-in ``56K'' modem that
leaves the type 2 PC Card slot free for other things.
</P>
<P>
   The price for all this miniaturization is a surprisingly low
$2,000, but a slightly fancier model, the VAIO 505GX, is scheduled
to be introduced June 23 at the PC Expo show at the Jacob K. Javits
Convention Center. It increases the processor speed to 266
megahertz and adds a fast IEEE 1394 port that few users will ever
need. Those enhancements do not seem worth the extra $700 Sony will
exact for them.
</P>
<P>
   Both machines will officially be available July 24. The review
units I tried came with Windows 98 preinstalled, but lacked manuals
and the very last of their software tweaks and had some problems
suspending themselves and awakening where they left off.
Nonetheless, they came as close to being portable dream machines as
any I have ever used.
</P>
<P>
   The big question mark with a little machine is its keyboard. At
just under 90 percent of normal width, this one is serviceable but
not without annoyances. The right shift key is undersized, the top
row keys, including delete, are downright tiny, and the layout
takes getting used to. While you master it, you will probably be
glad for the oversized backspace key. Though the palm rest is
comfortable and helps counteract the screen's tendency to tilt the
unit backward when you use it in your lap, the keyboard lacks the
silken feel of IBM 560s.
</P>
<P>
   I strongly prefer pointing sticks to the touchpads that Sony
favors, but I was able to adjust this one to be a bit less twitchy
than some I have tried. On one unit the left button was excessively
stiff and unresponsive, so I did my clicking by tapping my finger
on the pad. A compartment at the edge of the screen holds a stylus;
in collaboration with a program called Scribblepad, it lets you
write or draw on the touchpad and see the results on the screen.
That might be a lifesaver if you need to sign a digital document
digitally, but I found it tricky to use. An unlimited undo feature
helps.
</P>
<P>
   The hard disk's sluggishness sometimes delays keyboard response.
To speed things up, I would seriously consider adding an extra 32
megabytes of random access memory for about $75. The current
maximum RAM total is 64 megabytes; newer forms of memory expected
later this year will extend that limit to 96.
</P>
<P>
   A monaural speaker, a headphone jack, a microphone (and separate
input), an infrared port and a Universal Serial Bus port are all
built in. A port replicator is included and offers the other
standard connectors _ printer, serial, keyboard, mouse and monitor
_ but dangles from the computer, connected only by a cable. The
unit also comes with an outboard floppy disk drive.
</P>
<P>
   A matching CD-ROM player costs about $300. It uses a PC Card to
connect, but in a rare design gaffe, it requires AC power and
cannot use the same power adapter as the computer. One of the
portable PC Card CD-ROM drives that can run on batteries would be a
better choice. Clever stereo speakers that cost about $100 a pair
and weigh about an ounce each snap on and off the edges of the
screen like ears without requiring cables. They improve the sound,
but the volume is low and their output will not be confused with
high fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   The computer's battery life is surprisingly good. In my tests,
the purple lithium-ion cylinder that comes with the unit lasts
about two hours at the maximum performance setting if you avoid
using the hard disk much and about an hour more if you let the
power management software reduce screen brightness and slow things
down. Frequent fliers will want the double-cylinder auxiliary
battery that adds about five ounces to the machine's total weight
but lasts significantly longer and helps balance the unit by
sticking out a bit at the back. Its only drawback is that it costs
about $300.
</P>
<P>
   A button beside the power switch can be programmed to run any of
three programs of your choosing whenever you press it alone or in
combination with the Alt or Control keys. A flip-out door turns
into a K56flex modem that accepts a standard phone jack,
eliminating the need for special connectors. Software should allow
it to be upgraded to the newer V.90 standard at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   What I hope will not become standard is Sony's practice of
making the warranty last just 90 days unless you register the
machine to get nine months more. Batteries are warranted for a
measly 30 days, period.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, lightweight computers ranging from cheaper
Windows CE machines to pricier machines with bigger screens and
their own distinctive looks will vie for the spotlight. But for the
moment the VAIO 505G is one of the best deals around. And if you
want to attract attention with your computer, there may be no
better way than to flaunt Sony's skinny lavender dandy.

LANGUAGE OF PHYSICS TIES PHYSICISTS' TONGUES
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAKAYAMA, Japan _ The language of physics, as spoken at
international conferences like the one last week where the
discovery of neutrino mass was announced, is becoming difficult
even for physicists to understand.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists take for granted the need for fluency in an enormous
vocabulary of difficult words and phrases unknown to most
nonphysicists. Some samples: eigenstates, fermions, bosons, spin,
coupling constants, hamiltonians, gauge invariance, Monte Carlo
simulation, the eightfold way, asympotic freedom and hundreds of
other verbal expressions of profound ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But remembering the acronyms used to denote specific experiments
poses another layer of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   A physicist last week remarked that ``when Karmen sings, we'll
get to the bottom of this problem.'' To understand that he was not
referring to an opera by Bizet, a listener had to know that Karmen
stands for ``Karlsruhe-Rutherford Medium Energy Neutrino
Experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the acronyms of experiments discussed last week by the 300
physicists who gathered for a meeting called ``Neutrino '98'' were
these:
</P>
<P>
   SUDAN, MACRO, CHOOZ, KAMLAND, GALLEX, CHORUS, NOMAD, DONUT,
MUNU, NEMO, DAMA, AMANDA, CRESST, EROS, GENIUS, EDELWEISS and OGLE.
</P>
<P>
   Some acronyms are compact and highly description, if a physicist
happens to know what they mean. For example the acronym for a major
Japanese-American experiment that is being built is called K2K
(pronounced ``Kay-to-Kay''). The name refers to a big Japanese
particle accelerator called KEK and to the underground neutrino
detector called Super-Kamiokande at the Kamioka Observatory near
here. When the K2K experiment is ready in two years, the KEK
accelerator will send a beam of neutrinos 140 miles through the
Earth's crust to the Kamioka detector; hence the name ``KEK to
Kamioka,'' or K2K for short.
</P>
<P>
   Political changes sometimes influence the names of experiments
or research organizations while leaving original acronyms intact.
For example, an underground neutrino detection experiment using a
huge tank of liquid gallium metal was named ``SAGE,'' which stood
for Soviet-American Gallium Experiment. The Soviet Union is no
more, and the experiment is now the ``Russian-American Gallium
Experiment,'' but since the acronym for this would be RAGE, the
experiment is still called SAGE.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in public sentiment also prompt changes in names.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s a collaboration of seven European nations
created the great particle physics laboratory called CERN
(pronounced ``SURN''), near Geneva, CERN being the French acronym
for European Center for Nuclear Research. But by the 1980s the word
``nuclear'' had acquired such unpleasant associations for opponents
of nuclear weapons and power plants that nuclear was dropped from
the laboratory name, which became ``European Laboratory for
Particle Physics.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless the laboratory is still universally called CERN,
even though the acronym, is now meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all major international meetings of physicists are
conducted in English, which is very convenient for scientists whose
native tongue that is. But at last week's meeting, participants
included physicists from Japan, Germany, Russia, France, Italy,
Spain, Portugal, Hungary, Korea and India. Some spoke excellent
English but others were barely comprehensible and their conference
presentations were hardly understood.
</P>
<P>
   Language problems at meetings like this are often exacerbated by
poorly prepared exhibits. Physicists commonly illustrate their
technical talks with diagrams, graphs and tables scrawled on
transparencies that are projected on a screen. But the equations
and words crammed into these transparencies, usually prepared in
haste, are often so small and messy that only audience members with
binoculars can read them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always tell which speakers are professors and which
are graduate students,'' said Maurice Goldhaber, former director of
the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Long Island. ``The professors
know that it isn't enough to understand your own experiment. You
must be able to make it intelligible to an audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Making particle physics generally accessible even to particle
physicists poses a growing challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field of neutrino physics is growing so fast that the work
of one physicist is no longer necessarily understood by a scientist
working in some other branch of the same field,'' said David
Caldwell of the University of California at Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Commented another physicist, ``It's time to bring some coherence
to the language of a field that might become a kind of Tower of
Babel.''

FRENCH RIOT POLICE TRY TO CONTROL BRITISH HOOLIGANS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   MARSEILLE, France _ For the second consecutive day, tear gas
drifted through the streets of this port city. The World Cup that
Marseille hoped to celebrate with parades, concerts and bicycle
races on the beach has not gone according to plan.
</P>
<P>
   French riot police had to intervene again on Monday to stop
fighting between fans of England's and Tunisia's soccer teams. As
of 9 p.m., 16 more people had been arrested and 22 treated at local
hospitals, according to a spokesperson for the regional prefecture.
On Sunday night, 35 people were hospitalized, including one
Englishman with a serious knife wound, and 50 arrested _ 30
English, 14 French and six Tunisian _ during rioting in the old
port of Marseille.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until last night, this was a party, but it's not a party
anymore,'' said Jean-Noel Ruiz, a 17-year-old from Marseille.
</P>
<P>
   Regional prefect Jean-Paul Proust responded by prohibiting the
sale of alcohol in Marseille after 4:30 p.m. to people who wished
to take it away. He also ordered bars in the city center to close
by 11 p.m., although many establishments elected not to open at all
on Monday night after the violence continued during the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these people want to continue creating violence here, they
will be expelled from French territory and will not be allowed to
come back for other matches,'' Proust said.
</P>
<P>
   The first incident on Monday occurred outside the gates of the
Stade-Velodrome approximately two hours before the start of the
England and Tunisia game in Group G. As fans emerged from the metro
and made their way toward the stadium, groups of Tunisian and
English supporters began hurling bottles and cans at each other and
exchanging blows. According to police, 10 English fans were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later, there would be more altercations, injuries
and arrests at the Prado beach approximately one mile from the
stadium where thousands of fans were watching the match on a
giant-screen television. According to witnesses, the trouble began
shortly after striker Alan Shearer gave England a 1-0 lead in the
43rd minute of the match that England would end up winning, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until then, it was calm,'' said Maxime Dray, 30, of Marseille
who was sitting in the temporary stands. ``Before the match, there
were English and Tunisian fans playing soccer together on the
grass. When the game started, the Tunisian fans went into the
stands, and the English stayed on the grass. But after Shearer
scored, some of the English fans turned around and started taunting
the Tunisian supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Dray and Hilde Smet, a Belgian, someone threw a
bottle in the direction of the English fans, who quickly
retaliated. The opposing fans began throwing bottles, cans, rocks
and plastic seats at each other. Dray said thousands of bystanders,
including elderly people and parents with young children, were
forced to flee.
</P>
<P>
   ``A group of English fans charged toward the stands, and there
was general panic,'' Dray said.
</P>
<P>
   Riot police arrived several minutes later, and fired tear-gas
cannisters into the crowd, and as the match at Stade-Velodrome
continued, the acrid smell of the tear gas soon drifted into the
upper reaches of the stadium. The prefecture's spokesperson said 18
people were treated at local hospitals because of injuries suffered
at Prado beach. A child was reportedly injured by a thrown bottle,
but the prefecture said none of the injured were in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's war,'' said one French teen-ager of North African
descent, as he limped away from the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the hooligans against us,'' said Ramzi Hizi, a
18-year-old French youth whose parents are Tunisian immigrants as
he pointed to a large bruise on his wrist he said was caused by a
rock. ``I don't know why people are surprised. When the English
fans come to town, it is always like this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   English clubs were banned from competing in European Cup
competition in May 1985 after 39 people died and more than 400 were
injured when a wall collapsed at Heysel Stadium in Brussels,
Belgium, because rioting by English fans caused panic. The ban was
lifted before the 1990-91 season. The incidents in Marseille are
the most serious involving English fans since 1993 when they
clashed with Dutch supporters before a World Cup qualifying match
in Rotterdam, Netherlands. England ultimately would not qualify for
the 1994 World Cup finals in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair responded to the
incidents in the old port by terming the behavior of the English
fans ``a total disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   Gareth Davies, a 30-year-old from Surrey who attended the match
in Marseille wearing an English jersey said, ``I'm ashamed to wear
the shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Marseille residents were quick to turn their anger with the
English into support for the Tunisians. ``I've never seen so many
French people rooting for Tunisia,'' said Mehdi Benismail, a
25-year-old from Paris with dual Tunisian and French citizenship.
``There's a lot of racism against North Africans in France, but
people were honking at me and shouting encouragement to me when
they saw me wearing my Tunisian flag to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Thompson, also from Surrey, said of the violence: ``It all
takes the edge off our team's victory a bit. But we arrived this
morning and went through the city, and there were so many bars, and
all the English fans were drinking themselves into oblivion. The
authorities should have thought before the match about all of this.
It's up to them. They can either make money selling alcohol or they
can pay the bill to clean up the mess afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Proust said eight fans were scheduled to appear in a Marseille
courtroom on Monday and that 16 shops and restaurants in the old
port were damaged during the incidents on Sunday night. He said
English police had been working closely with French police to help
identify potential hooligans but said ``you can't check every
person who comes into Marseille.''
</P>
<P>
   Police were stationed at toll gates leading into the city before
Monday's game, and authorities said that reinforcements had been
called in to supplement the 1,900 law-enforcement officers already
scheduled to be deployed. Marseille police chief Michel Sappin said
an error had been made by scheduling England's opening game on a
Monday because it allowed fans the possibility of arriving on the
weekend and making mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Cooper, a spokesman for soccer's international governing
body FIFA, said the schedule had been made two years earlier _ long
before England qualified for the World Cup _ and could not have
been modified. He also said there were no plans to ban England from
this World Cup finals. ``The English Football Association and the
English football team cannot be held responsible for people
throwing chairs through restaurant windows or setting fire to their
opponents' flag,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said extra security
measures would be taken for England's next two games in Group G:
Monday, June 22 in Toulouse against Romania and Saturday June 26 in
Lens against Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Some Toulouse residents already are preparing for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't be working that night,'' said Jean-Paul Garcia, a taxi
driver in Toulouse on Monday. ``I don't want my car to be
damaged.''

   &UR; TAKING A CAR TO EUROPE &LR;  &QL; 
Q. (italics)I am planning to live in Europe for a few years,
starting in Britain, and I want to take my car. Can I ship it as
freight and go along as a passenger? _ Robert B. Carlin, New York,
N.Y.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. A very comfortable way to accompany your car to Britain is on
the Queen Elizabeth 2. And since you are relocating, it may not be
as costly as you might think.
</P>
<P>
   JoNell Modys, a Cunard Lines spokeswoman, said Cunard offered
passengers who were moving overseas free shipping of a car on the
Queen Elizabeth with a booking in a midgrade (C5) or above on a
trans-Atlantic crossing _ $3,630 a person and up, double occupancy.
Return air fare is included in the cost of the cruise; since you
won't be returning the line absorbs the cost of the car shipping
instead, she explained.
</P>
<P>
   For those not relocating, the cost of shipping a car on the
liner is $2,550 one way and $3,950 round trip, plus $85 in port and
handling charges. Motorcycles cost $1,195 each way and bicycles,
stored in the ship's hold, $45 each.
</P>
<P>
   The QE2 usually makes eight eastbound trans-Atlantic crossing a
year, April through December, from New York. Call Cunard at (800)
528-6273.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to make your passage on a freighter, or pay less,
you may have to make a detour through Rotterdam. Travl Tips, a
Queens, N.Y., cruise company that deals with freighters, can book
you and your car on one of two Mineral Shipping freighters. The
Patty and the Christiane are seven-passenger freighters that sail
between Savannah, Ga., and Rotterdam about once a month, according
to George Koch of Travl Tips. Both ships offer outside cabins with
private bath.
</P>
<P>
   The cost is $650 a car one way, plus, on the Patty, $1,250 for a
one-way passenger or on the Christiane $1,400. Travl Tips can be
reached at (800) 872-8584 or (718) 939-2400.
</P>
<P>
   Among companies that will ship cars but won't take passengers,
Auto Overseas, (800) 283-3990, offers service to either Liverpool
or Southampton. Cars are priced by size: $700 for a small car, $800
for a midsize.
</P>
<P>
   Before moving, don't forget to check with United States Customs
and British Information Services in New York, (212) 752-5747, for
information on regulations and taxes you may face.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, relief from customs duty and value added tax is
available if you plan to live in Britain at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Also, you might want to read ``Moto Europa,'' a guide to driving
in Europe, by Eric Bredesen. It includes a chapter on shipping and
importing vehicles. It is $15.95 from Seren Publishing, (800)
387-6728. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ON HANS BRINKER'S HEELS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)My family is interested in a skating holiday in the
Netherlands. Can you suggest a route and how to find
accommodations? _ Elaine Fallon, Baltimore (end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. While ice skating and the Netherlands seem synonymous, there
is no guarantee that the canals of Holland will freeze at any given
time in winter. Freezing can start in late December, but late
January and February are more likely to bring very cold weather.
</P>
<P>
   Your best bet is probably to head for the northern province of
Friesland, home of the Eleven Towns Race, the Elfstedentocht, or to
North Holland, in and around Amsterdam, according to Annemijn
Delavieter, a spokeswoman for the Netherlands Board of Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   The Elfstedentocht, a one-day, 124-mile test of endurance that
begins and ends in Leeuwarden and follows the canals connecting 11
towns, takes place only when the canals freeze. It was held last on
Jan. 4, 1997, but that was the first one since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   When it is held _ and there is usually only a few days' notice _
it attracts serious, even world-class speed skaters, and thousands
of spectators. But it also attracts thousands of others who tag
along at a more leisurely pace, or take part in shorter races on
the canals.
</P>
<P>
   So, with luck, you might follow the route _ through Kokkum,
Franeker, Harlingen, Bolsward, Workum, Hindeloopen, Stavoren,
Sloten, Ijlst and Sneek. If it is cold but the canals aren't safely
frozen, there is still a good chance for skating in the squares and
ponds in these towns, Ms. Delavieter said. There is also a skating
museum, Het Eerste Friese Schaatmuseum, in Hindelopen.
</P>
<P>
   For information, call the Netherlands Board of Tourism at (888)
464-6552. The board's Web site _ www.nbt.nl _ is also a good place
to start looking for accommodations. It includes a form to order
the book ``Bed &AMP; Breakfast in Holland,'' which costs about $17. It
can also be ordered by sending credit card information by fax to
(31-50) 313-3177. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; CIVIL WAR TOURS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)I am interested in tours that visit major Civil War
sites with knowledgeable guides. Do such tours exist? _ J. Michael
Parker, Narragansett, R.I.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. There are indeed companies specializing in Civil War tours,
including at least three in Virginia, near many of the most famous
battle sites. These companies say they use historians _ authors,
teachers or National Park Service employees _ as guides. Most of
their tours last one to three days, and do not include
transportation to the base or starting place for the tours.
</P>
<P>
   The Civil War Society, Post Office Box 770, Berryville, Va.
22611, has been in business more than 16 years, Kevin Dunbar, the
marketing director, said. The organization has eight remaining
tours this year through November _ from a one-day look at
Sheridan's 1964 Cavalry Drive on Richmond, on Aug. 1 in
Fredericksburg, Va., ($60) to one- and two-week versions of The
Civil War in the West through Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi and
Tennessee, Oct. 18 to 29 ($1,195 to $2,195 for tours, hotels and
daily breakfast and two dinners). Call (800) 247-6253 for the full
schedule, or see www.civilwarsociety.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Civil War Education Association, 21 North Loudon Street,
Winchester, Va. 22601, has nine tours left this year, most focusing
on Gettysburg or Fredericksburg. Fees range from $95, including
lunch, for one-day walking tours of Gettysburg on Sept. 26 and Oct.
3, to $275 for Fallen Knights: The Brothers Ashby in Winchester,
Va., on Oct. 22 to 25, which includes two lunches and a dinner but
not lodging. Information: (800) 298-1861, fax (800) 550-1347.
</P>
<P>
   A newcomer to the field is Hardtack Tours, 30 Blue Ridge Avenue,
Front Royal, Va. 22630. Among its offerings is a Newport News, Va.,
tour, Aug. 20 to 22, that includes a harbor cruise to the site of
the Monitor vs. Merrimack battle and a Civil War mystery play and
dinner ($185). Phone and fax: (540) 635-5078.

   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics) Why do some kinds of cookware get very hot in the
microwave?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. There are two reasons why cookware may heat up excessively in
a microwave oven, said Dr. Louis A. Bloomfield, professor of
physics at the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the same effect that is used in cooking: microwaves
are rapidly fluctuating electromagnetic fields, which push on
electric charges and twist naturally polarized particles like water
molecules back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   In liquid water, this twisting leads to molecular friction and
heating. If the cookware is wet, like a porous crockery garlic
cooker that is moistened before use, it will get very hot.
</P>
<P>
   A second effect can also cause trouble as the microwaves push
free electric charges around.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a good conductor of electricity through which the charges
move easily, the microwaves are reflected,'' Bloomfield said. ``The
metal walls of the oven, for example, barely heat at all. But in a
poor conductor, the charges being pushed around in the material
cause resistance heating, just like that in the heating element of
a hair dryer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try to reheat your coffee in your grandmother's
porcelain teacup with a gold ring around it, the ring burns up just
like a light bulb filament,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To test pottery or dinnerware for use in a microwave, put the
empty dish in the oven alongside a cup of water in a glass
container. Microwave on high for one minute. If the dish stays
cool, it is safe to use.

EMPOWERING OUT, ENABLING IN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: W.Va., Texas, Ill., Calif., Minn., Okla.)   (For release on Sunday, June 21.)  
 (EDS: items in boldface should be set in italics.)  
(lh) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Tobacco is an addiction which should not be  &UR; enabled &LR;  by
public funds,'' writes Mike Harman of St. Albans, W.Va. Although
his argument would be strengthened by using  &UR; that &LR;  instead of
 &UR; which &LR;  to introduce a restrictive clause, he uses a verb that is
gaining great popularity.
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; Enabling &LR;  Bad Behavior'' was the headline over the letter to
The New York Times from another reader, William Frago of Lake
Forest, Ill., who objected to a leading feminist's vigorous defense
of President Clinton: ``I am afraid that Gloria Steinem has become
an  &UR; enabler &LR;  to the very behavior the women's movement once sought
to punish.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in its noun form,  &UR; enabler &LR; , this word has made a
quantum jump from hero to villain. (In physics, a  &UR; quantum jump &LR;  is
tiny but sudden. In general use,  &UR; quantum &LR;  means ``huge and
sudden''; it is used here to mean ``sudden.'')
</P>
<P>
   Some people still use the word in its positive sense: Pastor
Thomas Kilgore of the Second Baptist Church of Los Angeles says his
task is ``to be an  &UR; enabler &LR;  to the people who are farthest down
and getting the bitter end of life.'' But many are substituting
 &UR; facilitator &LR;  for that positive sense of ``helper'' and are using
 &UR; enabler &LR;  to mean ``one who by ignoring, appeasing or condoning
makes possible the continuance of wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   This sense has its origin in the group therapy that is now
called  &UR; the recovery movement &LR; . Bill Pittman of Alcoholics
Anonymous, co-author of the 1989 ``AA, The Way It Began,'' says
that its use of ``the word  &UR; enabling &LR;  first appeared in Al-Anon
literature in the early '60s.'' Al-Anon is an organization of
groups of family and friends of alcoholics. A 1965 book reads:
``There are many occasions when we all engage in  &UR; enabling &LR; 
destructive or inappropriate behavior in other people. ... Most
instances are not so obvious or dramatic as the  &UR; enabling &LR;  that may
have gone on with the alcoholic.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Kaminer, author of ``I'm Dysfunctional, You're
Dysfunctional,'' defines  &UR; enabler &LR;  as ``someone who makes it easier
for another to pursue an addiction, one complicit in bad behavior _
like the wife of an alcoholic helping him hide the bottles from the
kids.'' She says: ``The word  &UR; enable &LR;  can be contrasted with the
word  &UR; empower &LR; . You  &UR; empower &LR;  a person to do something good, and
you  &UR; enable &LR;  someone to do something bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Though a lexicographer would disagree (a dictator can be
 &UR; empowered &LR;  to invade a neighbor and a surgeon  &UR; enabled &LR;  to save a
life), usagists understand that latest connotation. A 1987 book
published by the Johnson Institute was titled ``The Family
 &UR; Enablers &LR; ,'' and a 1994 book by Carol Remboldt further darkens the
connotation with the title ``Violence in Schools: The  &UR; Enabling &LR; 
Factor.''
</P>
<P>
   That new sense is no longer limited to families of alcoholics or
drug abusers, as indicated in usages by critics of a defender of
Clinton's in his friendship with an intern. Michael Curtin, a trust
attorney in Washington, was quoted by The Washington Post on how to
give siblings with disabilities a feeling of self-worth and
independence: ``Whatever you do, you have to be careful not to be
an  &UR; enabler &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   I tried the word on an Internet search engine and triggered this
response. ``I play in the  &UR; Enablers &LR; , the Dallas band with the Web
site you visited,'' writes Bart Chaney from Texas. ``I came up with
the name when we put our combo together about four years ago. I had
the noun in mind from the world of therapy. There was some irony
here, but it was not meant darkly. Some addictions _ one to cool
music in a dark room, for example _ are not all that bad.'' The
musician added, ``Hey, if you mentioned us, that would be a
thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   Having just adjusted to the change from ``writer'' to ``content
provider,'' here am I, a  &UR; thrill-enabler &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   NO GEEK PIQUE
</P>
<P>
   Under a green, bucolic photo of a farm in Minnesota, a state
that likes to think of itself as the land of 10,000 lakes, Newsweek
ran this caption: ``The land of 10,000  &UR; geeks &LR; ?'' The story had to
do with the Minnesota High-Tech Association's ads to attract
technical workers from California's Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, The Daily Oklahoman wrote about Vice President
Al Gore as one who ``dreams not of carnal conquests but of
technological breakthroughs'' and is thus ``the nation's No. 1
 &UR; geek &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   This word's meaning has wandered far from its roots. ``He is a
foole, a sotte, and a  &UR; geke &LR; ,'' wrote Alexander Barclay in his 1515
``Certayne Egloges,'' using the lively words of the time to
denounce a simpleton. Shakespeare chimed in twice, first in
``Twelfth Night'' about ``the most notorious  &UR; gecke &LR;  and gull'' and
later in ``Cymbeline'' as a ghost denounces a rogue who made
Posthumus ``the  &UR; geeck &LR;  and scorn o' th' other's villainy.''
</P>
<P>
   The old synonym for ``fool'' took a sinister turn in American
carnival slang to describe a ``wild man'' in a sideshow whose
revolting act often included biting the head off a live snake or
chicken. Despite this specialized sense, and notwithstanding World
War II military use in the form of  &UR; gook &LR;  as a slur at Asians, the
word continued to have a central sense of ``fool.'' In '80s slang
it became a generalized term of contempt, like  &UR; dork &LR;  (perhaps from
the cutting-edge  &UR; dirk &LR;  influenced by a nickname) and the
too-studious student  &UR; grind &LR;  or  &UR; nerd &LR;  (probably from the earlier
``nerts to you,'' based on  &UR; nuts &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   How, then, did the derogatory  &UR; geek &LR;  become the self-description
of choice for hackers and computer technocrats?
</P>
<P>
   It all began when  &UR; bad &LR; , pronounced b-a-a-a-a-d, became
synonymous with ``good _ really good.'' The inversion of meaning
swept through groups eager to ``out'' their unpopularity, much as
 &UR; queer &LR;  was adopted by homosexuals to challenge their stereotyping
by others. Hence, the term  &UR; geek &LR;  _ the ``fool'' from five
centuries back, later disdained in circuses as the lowest of the
low _ has become the badge worn proudly by the virtuosos of the
Virtual Generation.

THE SECRET OF A GOOD GOLF GAME IS FOUND IN SCIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When 93-year-old Theodore P. Jorgensen isn't
trying to extract secrets of quantum mechanics from Albert
Einstein's special theory of relativity, he's thinking about golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to a driving range here in town,'' said the
semi-retired University of Nebraska physicist. ``There was this guy
down there, swinging, hooking and slicing. I thought, `This is
terrible.' So I asked him if I could coach him a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorgensen _ who, late in World War II, built monitors to measure
shock waves from an atomic blast _ explained a few principles of
physics.
</P>
<P>
   After the man took several swings, Jorgensen said, ``he turned
to me and asked, `Is that all there is to it?'''
</P>
<P>
   To the legions of duffers looking to gain inspiration from the
pros at this week's U.S. Open in San Francisco, there's a lesson
here: Golf is not just a sport, it's a science.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say you will lower your handicap by cracking a
few books. But mastering some of the science might help explain why
your drives fall short and your putts run long.
</P>
<P>
   And you'll know a lot more about what happens when the club head
meets the ball.
</P>
<P>
   For example: A typical golf ball moves about 160 mph when struck
by the average pro on the PGA tour.
</P>
<P>
   On a drive, the ball spins backward at as many as 8,000
revolutions per minute, according to the book ``Newton at the
Bat,'' edited by Eric W. Schrier and William D. Allman.
</P>
<P>
   The dimples on a golf ball aren't just for looks; they make a
big difference in performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``A drive hit without backspin will come down after four seconds
from a height of 65 feet. The same drive hit with a dimpled golf
ball will stay up for six seconds, resulting in a drive up to 80
feet longer,'' writes Ira Flatow in the book ``Rainbows, Curve
Balls and Other Wonders of the Natural World Explained.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the same phenomenon that enables an 800,000-pound Boeing
747 to lift off the ground: If the ball spins backward, toward the
golfer, the air under the ball will flow more slowly than the air
above.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a principle that scientist Daniel Bernouilli
explained in 1738, the air below the ball is slightly denser than
above. That forces the ball slightly upward, prolonging its
distance and time aloft.
</P>
<P>
   The dimples on golf balls scoop up air and force it around the
ball, increasing the pressure difference.
</P>
<P>
   It works the same way on a plane, the wings are shaped to move
the air faster above and slower below. The result is lift.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of golf balls use countless designs to persuade
hackers that they can gain a competitive edge. Even though the
United States Golf Association sets strict guidelines for design,
about 1,900 different types of golf balls are qualified for use.
</P>
<P>
   Jorgensen, who didn't first hit the greens until age 50, about
the time President Dwight Eisenhower was putting on the White House
Lawn, is skeptical that the aerodynamic properties are markedly
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt it very much,'' he said. Still, ``some of these balls
are put together with different materials, so their rotational
parameters are different ... and the dimples come in different
shapes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't realize how intricate the aerodynamics of (golf
ball) surfaces really is,'' said Jorgensen, who wrote the book
``The Physics of Golf.'' ``It's one of the most complicated aspects
(in physics). I'm in my 93rd year, but I keep working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorgensen's book isn't a simple how-to guide to playing a better
game. The book requires careful study to grasp its advice, which is
based on principles of classical physics that go back to the days
of the great 17th-century physicist Isaac Newton.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the book explains that Many golfers fail to
exploit a principle known to physicists as ``centrifugal torque.''
An everyday example is how water stays in a bucket being swung in a
circle. Using physics calculations and geometrical examples,
Jorgensen explains how a golfer can best exploit centrifugal torque
at the club head by relaxing, not stiffening, his wrist on the
downward swing.
</P>
<P>
   Golfers often don't understand that by swinging their clubs in
certain ways, they alter the angle of other body parts and weaken
the club's impact on the ball. Using a simple analogy that involves
a yardstick and a string, Jorgensen shows in his book why a
right-handed golfer should use his left shoulder to pull on his
left arm during the swing.
</P>
<P>
   That causes the club to swing more precisely, he said, because
the legs, thighs and back muscles will be aligned ideally to inject
maximum energy into the swing.

<P>
   The golf equipment company Orlimar is ballyhooing its new
``TriMetal'' wood, claiming it ``uses a unique combination of
metals and weighting for superior strength and accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, said Orlimar President Jesse Ortiz, golf
club design has relied heavily on materials from the aerospace
industry, such as metal-mix composites and ceramics.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of graphite shafts has ``tremendously helped''
women, Ortiz said. The shafts are stronger, so more of the club's
weight can be shifted to the head, where it can do the most good.
</P>
<P>
   Hot new designs, not coincidentally, also have tremendously
helped equipment makers. Orlimar anticipates close to $30 million
in sales this year, compared with $1.5 million the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Science could bring out professional skills in even ordinary
players if the USGA didn't clamp restrictions on technical
innovations.
</P>
<P>
   By tinkering with the arrangement and shape of dimples, ``they
could make golf balls that anybody could hit 300 to 350 yards if
the ball manufacturers didn't have any restrictions,'' Ortiz said.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, ``if that happened, then it would destroy the
game, because anybody could be a Tiger Woods.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Polly Matzinger, 50, a tenured medical researcher at the
National Institutes of Health, is turning the world of immunology
upside down with her radical theory suggesting that the human
immune system is activated not by alien substances in the body, but
by dangerous ones _ the Danger Theory of immunology. She sat in her
Bethesda, Md., garden recently, explaining the evolution of her
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Q. As a child, what kind of work did you think you'd be doing
when you grew up?
</P>
<P>
   DR. MATZINGER. A jockey, a seeing-eye dog trainer, a composer. I
grew up in a very creative original family. My mother, a French
ex-nun, is a potter. My father, a Dutch World War II resistance
fighter who was imprisoned in Dachau, is a painter and carpenter.
My sister is an artist and my brother is a mechanic and rock
musician.
</P>
<P>
   I sing, play piano and bass and compose music. But I don't sing
or play very well, and the music I write is dead-boring. The only
thing I've found that I'm really creative in ... is science. It
wasn't an art form I expected to find, but then, my family has
always blazed their own trails.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did you find science?
</P>
<P>
   A. I was a cocktail waitress in Davis, Calif. in 1972. I'd been
in and out of school and done all kinds of jobs _ jazz musician,
lab technician, problem-dog trainer and Playboy bunny, which was,
incidentally, a great job. But everything seemed to get boring
after a while, so I decided to make a career of waitressing and
save the days for reading, composing and working with animals.
</P>
<P>
   One day, two professors from the University of California at
Davis who regularly came in for beer, started talking about animal
mimicry, and I asked them, ``Why has no animal ever mimicked a
skunk?'' Professor Robert Swampy Schwab, who was chair of Wildlife
and Fisheries, was floored. He decided that this question-asking
waitress should become a scientist.
</P>
<P>
   For nine months, he came to the bar and brought me all kinds of
scientific articles. And he convinced me that science never gets
boring. At his urging, I applied to graduate school. I started in
1974, got a belated bachelor's degree in '76 and a Ph.D. in '79. I
owe that man my life.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When did you begin questioning the ideas that are the bedrock
of immunological theory?
</P>
<P>
   A. In graduate school, we learned that the immune system fights
anything that isn't part of our bodies. But that didn't make sense
to me. I wondered why mothers didn't reject their fetuses, why we
didn't reject the food we eat, or the stuff in the air we breathe.
But my professors all said, ``Don't worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   So I stopped worrying. This is a cowardly habit that we
scientists can fall into. If we really can't answer a question, we
sometimes stop asking it. Ten years later, I came to the National
Institutes of Health and met a brilliant young oncologist, Ephraim
Fuchs. He wondered about these questions, too. And we began
thrashing them out.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How does your Danger Model differ from the standard
Self/Nonself Model of the immune system?
</P>
<P>
   A. It isn't really insurrectionary _ it's just a different way
of looking at things. Let me use an analogy to explain it. Imagine
a community in which the police accept anyone they met during
elementary school and kill any new migrant. That's the Self/Nonself
Model.
</P>
<P>
   In the Danger Model, tourists and immigrants are accepted, until
they start breaking windows. Only then do the police move to
eliminate them. In fact, it doesn't matter if the window breaker is
a foreigner or a member of the community. That kind of mutant
behavior is considered unacceptable, and the destructive individual
is removed.
</P>
<P>
   The community police are the white blood cells of the immune
system. The Self/Nonself Model says that they kill anything that
enters the body after an early training period in which ``self'' is
learned.
</P>
<P>
   In the Danger Model, the police wander around, waiting for an
alarm signaling that something is doing damage. If an immigrant
enters without doing damage, the white cells simply continue to
wander, and after a while, the harmless immigrant becomes part of
the community.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did you arrive at your alternate model for the immune
system?
</P>
<P>
   A. It didn't happen in a day. There were two difficult parts.
First Ephraim and I took a year to realize that a truly useful
immune system would fight dangerous things and ignore harmless
ones. But we couldn't figure out how to tell the difference. One
day, while I was in the bath, the answer just popped out! It was:
``Things that are dangerous do damage. No damage, no danger.'' It
seems really simple, doesn't it? But it took us a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Next we had to figure out how the white blood cells learn about
the damage. That thought also arrived oddly. Annie, my Border
collie, and I were watching over some sheep grazing in a field.
Suddenly something moved in the woods, startling the sheep, and
Annie jumped up to protect them. It hit me that something was
amiss. Well, almost every organ of the body has a few sentinels _
called dendritic cells _ that are like sleeping sheep dogs. Alarm
signals from injured cells could wake them up and alert the immune
system.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the value of your theory of the immune system?
</P>
<P>
   A. Besides the beauty of it? Well, first, it explains many
things the old model couldn't _ like why mothers don't reject their
fetuses. They don't do damage. Second, there are some important
practical implications. For example, the old model assumed that
very young babies would be really hard to vaccinate because their
immune systems were busy learning who the ``self'' was. Then we
published a paper showing how to vaccinate 1-day-old baby mice. Now
there's a lot more hope about early vaccination.
</P>
<P>
   Another hopeful area is cancer treatment. I really believe we
can use vaccination to cure perhaps 80 percent of all cancers.
Though there's a lot of research in this area, it isn't working
very well. The Danger Model predicts that some simple changes could
make anti-cancer vaccinations very effective.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. But there is a lot of resistance to making those simple
changes, based on your theory, isn't there?
</P>
<P>
   A. The resistance isn't really to the changes. It's to the
Danger Model itself. People grew up with a particular view of how
immunity works. When I say, ``That's not how it works _ please
accept that for a moment and you'll see we could do something
effective against tumors,'' they are unable to try. It's partly
fair. The Danger Model is new, and to experiment on people, you
need to have a sound basis for the treatment. Still, I don't
understand why they won't try it on cancer in animals.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the next big question in immunity?
</P>
<P>
   A. Once we know what activates it, we next have to learn how to
make the right kind of response. Viruses aren't cleared the same
way as worms, and right now nobody has a clue how the immune system
knows the difference. There's not even a theory. My lab is just
starting to move in that direction, and I'm thinking hard about it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm told you dislike the way science and technology have
become hyphenated terms _ why?
</P>
<P>
   A. Because they are very different. Science is more like art and
true scientists are more like artists. Except that we don't have to
starve in garrets because governments and foundations pay us.
Technology is about vaccines and plastics and drugs and things that
work in the world. Science is about describing nature, and so is
art: We're painting nature.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you think the scientific world is too solemn?
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, no. Not true science. It's art. Actually, it's a sandbox
and scientists get to play all of our lives.

GOLDEN BEAR MOVES BACK INTO THE LIMELIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DWIGHT CHAPIN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The old Golden Bear was just about ready for
hibernation.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in the four major golf tournaments every year since 1962
_ 145 in a row _ seemingly was enough for Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he and his wife, Barbara, who shares in all his big
decisions, had pretty much made up their minds that his historic
consecutive-tournament streak would end with the 1998 Masters in
April.
</P>
<P>
   But then United States Golf Association vice president Trey
Holland called Nicklaus and offered him a special invitation to
play in the next three U.S. Opens, including this week's tournament
at the Olympic Club in San Francisco, saying things just wouldn't
be the same without him in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very flattered by the invitation,'' Nicklaus, 58, said,
``but I don't want to play if I can't be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't seem to be a problem, seeing as how Nicklaus _ who
has won a record-tying four Opens and finished second four other
times _ shot a 283 at the Masters and finished just four shots
behind winner Mark O'Meara.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara said, `If you think you can add to the tournament and
be competitive and you want to work to do it, then you should,'''
Nicklaus said. ```But you took a big load off your back a few days
ago when you made the decision (to end the streak). Do you want to
put it back on?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Barbara, the USGA has never made a decision like this
before. They're setting a precedent. If they feel that strongly
that I could help their golf tournament, then I have to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus will not be merely the oldest player in the field on
the Lake Course this week. He'll also be the only one who has
played 42 consecutive Opens (11 more than Gene Sarazen and Arnold
Palmer), made 34 cuts (21 straight between 1964 and 1984), had the
most subpar rounds (35) and the most rounds in the 60s (29).
</P>
<P>
   As if the USGA had to think twice about his helping the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Club, however, has not been one of his most
memorable venues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never done anything special there,'' said Nicklaus, who
finished third at the U.S. Open at Olympic in 1966 and was just one
shot out of the lead after 36 holes in the 1987 Open, but finished
far down the list after closing rounds of 76 and 77. ``I've always
liked the Olympic Club and played reasonably well there, but I've
never won.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's not literally true.
</P>
<P>
   Just 11 months ago, Nicklaus hammered Johnny Miller for an
11-stroke victory there in the two-man, made-for-television
``Shell's Wonderful World of Golf.'' Nicklaus shot a 1-under-par
70, making only two bad swings all day: an errant iron off the tee
at the seventh hole and a poor drive at the 12th that led to
bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack put on a clinic out there,'' Miller said the day of his
defeat. ``He didn't make a mental mistake all day. If there was a
U.S. Open this week, he'd have a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus isn't making bold predictions about his 1998 finish,
but during a USGA telephone interview, he did say:
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the type of game I'm playing right now will be very
suitable for the Olympic Club. I'm hitting the ball solidly,
driving pretty straight, and my putting has been pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been able to hit the ball left to right or right to left.
Those are things you need to do at an Open. You need to be able to
play all your shots. I go into a lot of tournaments where I only
have half my game or two-thirds of my game in shape and kind of
struggle with the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus' struggles aren't much like the struggles of ordinary
golfers, of course.
</P>
<P>
   And his Open history speaks for itself.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, at Oakmont Country Club, he beat Palmer by four strokes
for his first Open victory. Five years later, at Baltusrol, he
topped Palmer again, by four strokes. In 1972, at Pebble Beach, he
bested Bruce Crampton by three strokes, then defeated Isao Aoki by
two at Baltusrol in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I played in the Open was at Inverness (in
Toledo, Ohio) in 1957, when I was 17 years old,'' Nicklaus said.
``The tournament has always been special. I played with Ben Hogan
the last two rounds in 1960, finishing second as an amateur, then
beat Arnold in a playoff in '62 for my first professional win. In
'67, I broke Hogan's record (with a 275), then won at Pebble Beach,
probably my favorite place to play, and came back at Baltusrol to
break my own scoring record.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's the first of at least three more hurrahs for the Bear,
who is no longer contemplating hibernation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played a lot of golf at the Olympic Club, and it's a
great golf course,'' he said. ``I'm looking forward to it very
much.''

 &HT;    The secret to success? It's superstitions
 &HT;    By Dan Graziano
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not all baseball superstitions are as obvious as the Florida
Marlins' high black socks. Most of them, you don't even notice.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, did you ever notice how Edgar Renteria, when he
runs out to his position to start the game, stops to bend down and
touch the chalk on the first-base line?
</P>
<P>
   Or did you know that Jay Powell wears the same cap all season _
actually had them sew the World Series patch onto his sweat-stained
black Marlins cap last October?
</P>
<P>
   And how about Marlins third-base coach Rich Donnelly? He chews
two kinds of gum. Before the game, he chews only Wrigley's
Doublemint gum (the kind with the green wrapper). And during games,
he chews only Wrigley's spearmint (white wrapper).
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly has been doing it since last July, and he's so stuck on
it that, when the Marlins played their first-round playoff series
in San Francisco last season, he remembered the lack of Wrigley's
gum in the visitor's clubhouse at 3Com Park (apparently, they serve
only bubble gum) and brought a pack of each with him from the
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot of success in this game, so the times you do
have success, you want to hang onto it,'' Donnelly said. ``To me,
it's not superstitious, but more that you feel good about what
you're doing. If you go out and get a steak and get five hits, I
guarantee you a lot of guys are going to go back to that steak
place. It doesn't have a thing to do with your hitting, but it
makes you feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   So after coaching third base in a pennant race, the playoffs and
the World Series last season, Donnelly figures he'd better stick
with the chewing gum. Just like this year's Marlins, after taking
2-of-3 against the Blue Jays this week while wearing those high
socks, figure they'll keep wearing them as long as they keep
playing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you've lost 10 or 11 in a row, you'll try anything,''
Powell said. ``Obviously the socks didn't win the games for us, but
over 162 games, you've got to do something different every once in
a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The socks stand out as an example because a whole team is doing
it. But baseball is loaded with individual superstitions, from Wade
Boggs eating chicken before every game to Toronto reliever Randy
Myers circling the mound after every pitch to some players' complex
adjustment routines before they step into the batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at what a guy like (Boston's Nomar) Garciaparra does
when he gets up to bat,'' Powell said of the shortstop's batting
glove routine. ``I don't know how he remembers to do all that
stuff. Most guys, if you ask them about it, they probably won't
talk to you about it, because either they don't know they do it or
they don't want to know they do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Renteria is a good example. Approached about his pre-game
touching of the base line, he shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always done that,'' he said. ``Always.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a touchy subject, perhaps as much as any in baseball. Asked
if baseball players are more superstitious than people in other
professions, Donnelly didn't hesitate to say yes.
</P>
<P>
   He did not, however, single out baseball players among athletes.
Donnelly said he used to read about the subject, and he discovered
once that the Lakers' Jerry West used to chew a half a stick of gum
and be the second-to-last one out of the locker room before every
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you have to be superstitious about in some jobs?''
Donnelly asked. ``This job is based on success every day. You have
to do something every day to keep your job. So, from the time
you're in the big leagues, you watch to make sure you don't step on
cracks, you see guys who don't change their underwear when they're
going good. You keep it going because it makes you feel like you're
doing something to help yourself, and that makes you feel good.''

 &HT;    Rodman more of a pain to Jazz than Bulls
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was two years ago, with the Chicago Bulls on their way to a
72-10 regular-season record and their fourth NBA championship of
this decade, when Michael Jordan plopped himself down in the
visitors' locker room at Miami Arena and said this about Dennis
Rodman:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sitting back waiting for Dennis to screw up. If we
look at it that way, it'll consume us. We have given him our
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman has since folded, spindled and mutilated that trust. He
has twisted it, ripped it and mangled it. He has mocked the Bulls
from front office to head coach to teammates.
</P>
<P>
   He is a narcissist and a clown. He is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   But he has not consumed the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Rodman has elevated them _ in support of Jordan and
Scottie Pippen, to be sure _ to the cusp of a repeat three-peat.
The Bulls, without Rodman, almost certainly would not hold a 3-1
edge on the Utah Jazz with an opportunity to close out the
best-of-seven series tonight in Chicago and claim their sixth title
in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Because on a basketball court, assigned to the specific tasks of
defense and rebounding, Rodman is simply an extraordinary talent.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the free throws Rodman made Wednesday night to help seal
Chicago's third victory against the Jazz, because those were flukes
as much as anything else.
</P>
<P>
   What is worth remembering is Rodman grabbed 14 rebounds, which
pretty much represents an average evening's work, and muzzled Utah
strongman Karl Malone. What matters is Rodman, when the mood
strikes him, is the only player in the NBA who can dramatically
influence a game by scoring very little or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the mood has struck Rodman again.
</P>
<P>
   Last season at this time, if you'll remember, the Bulls were
playing Utah for the same prize, and the concern in Chicago's camp
was Rodman was being too sedate. That's hardly a worry these days.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman skipped Monday's team practice, turned up in suburban
Detroit for a pro wrestling show that night and laughed all the way
to the bank on his way back to the NBA Finals. Rodman received a
reported $250,000 for his appearance as a cigar-smoking bad guy in
the brotherhood of Hulk Hogan, which more than compensated for any
fines accumulated as a basketball truant.
</P>
<P>
   But if Rodman's behavior has consumed anybody, it has consumed
the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have him,'' Utah coach Jerry Sloan said. ``I'd just
as soon lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Umm, Jerry, Rodman is busy helping you out with that even as you
speak. And the idea that Malone and John Stockton and Jeff Hornacek
wouldn't trade their famous Jazz-happy camaraderie for one
championship ring is ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls don't like Rodman; they endure him. Chicago center Luc
Longley nailed it when he said, ``We're sleeping in a nest that we
helped to build. Our acceptance of him and our tolerance of him
perpetuated the myth.''
</P>
<P>
   And all Rodman is doing is feathering his own nest. He's playing
for his next contract, which will probably come from somewhere else
(see: Los Angeles _ Lakers, Clippers or Hollywood), and punctuating
it with outlandish behavior that will help sell tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The whispers now are Jordan won't quit, after all. He may even
talk Pippen into re-signing, which, in turn, may influence Bulls
coach Phil Jackson to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, though, is gone.
</P>
<P>
   This is Jordan on Rodman, two years later:
</P>
<P>
   ``I can never figure this guy out, and I won't even start. We
have come to live with it and not really try to dissect this
individual. I don't know if he is an individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, somehow, he's always ready to play ... but there's no
understanding Dennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Against long odds, a fragile trust remains.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a wickedly unholy alliance, but a mesmerizingly
successful one.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Light rain fell at Anchorage, Alaska, on Sunday, marking a
record 17th consecutive day with measurable rainfall. On Tuesday,
the low-pressure system responsible for prolonging Anchorage's
rainy streak will forge into Montana, setting the stage for showers
and thunderstorms in the northern Rockies. Steadier rains will fall
in western Montana, where moist winds wrapping southwest around the
surface low are forced to rise up mountain slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east, heavy rain is possible in the Black Hills of South
Dakota as increasingly damp air from the southeast is drawn into
the Montana system's wind circulation and then forced to ascend the
sloping terrain. Late Tuesday, clusters of showers and
thunderstorms will flare up over the high plains of eastern
Colorado and western Nebraska as the advancing system interacts
with a stream of humid Gulf of Mexico air accelerating north at an
altitude of 2,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, isolated thunderstorms will erupt over the eastern
Gulf Coast and Southeast states as very warm and humid air rises
ahead of a slow-moving cool front. With a plume of high-level
moisture streaming east from the remnants of eastern Pacific
Tropical Storm Agatha, a few storms may produce very heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
   More rain will dampen northern New England as a slow-moving low
works in tandem with persistent onshore winds. West of the low, a
pool of cold air at 18,000 feet will promote showers and
thunderstroms from the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley to the central
Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Excessive Rainfall
</P>
<P>
   Over 13 inches of rain fell at Atlantic, Iowa, on Sunday, as two
seasonal catalysts for excessive rain joined forces. Warmth and
humidity built in the lowest layer of the atmosphere, creating a
powder-keg of energy consistent with the heavy rains of summer.
Aloft, a formidable jet stream disturbance reminiscent of early
spring provided strong dynamic lifting of air near 18,000 feet.
With mechanisms for heavy rains in spring and summer coming
together, the stage was set for a cloudburst. The sluggishness of
the weather pattern over the Midwest also was a factor.

 &HT;    No news is good news for Marlins
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've changed my mind.
</P>
<P>
   That's basically what Wayne Huizenga said last June when he
announced that the Florida Marlins were for sale and that's what
I'm saying today.
</P>
<P>
   The startling revelation that major league baseball is in no
real danger of petering out in South Florida actually came to me
while team owners gathered last week in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   You see, no action was taken on the Marlins' proposed sale to a
group of investors led by team President Don Smiley. Nothing
happened and that was OK. If nothing happens between now and
Christmas but a series of further postponements, that's OK, too.
</P>
<P>
   There's just no killing baseball, whether nothing happens or
something happens or everything happens.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to call this a peculiarly American quirk but it
works in Canada, too. There is no logical reason for the Montreal
Expos to be in business after years of playing before pitiful
crowds in a money pit of an old stadium. Yet the team goes on,
existing in a bizarre state of suspended competition.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, there is no need for the Marlins, World Series waifs,
to question the inevitability of their own survival. The proof is
in the pudding that passes for our brains. Not even the
cancellation of a World Series was enough to bury baseball.
</P>
<P>
   That disaster of disasters occurred in 1994, the year Jacobs
Field opened in Cleveland with the enthusiastic support of a
generation of tortured fans. Just as the Indians were driving
toward their first playoff spot in 26 years, the game shut itself
down for the rest of the season. And what happened the following
year?
</P>
<P>
   Average attendance went up at Jacobs Field and the Indians went
to the World Series. Baseball choked but it didn't croak.
</P>
<P>
   Neither will the game budge, no matter how violent the pull of
economic factors. The last time a major league franchise
transferred from one city to the next was 1972, when the Washington
Senators became the Texas Rangers. Livan Hernandez, the Marlins'
World Series MVP, had yet to arrive on the planet in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, an NFL team might back up the trucks and leave town
in the middle of the night but baseball refuses to acknowledge,
much less accept, failure.
</P>
<P>
   Why, the San Francisco Giants had been sold to St. Petersburg,
Fla. in 1992 when former National League President Bill White
stepped in and said no. The team stayed put, its money and stadium
problems still unsolved, but even so the Giants will open the 2000
season in a new ballpark in downtown San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Marlins will eventually succeed. They will coddle the
feelings of wounded fans and be forgiven, just as a special $1 kids
ticket promotion helped bring an astounding 35,652 to Pro Player
Stadium on Friday night. They will wave the World Series pennant as
physical evidence of a supernatural visitation. They will get final
approval for the purchase of the team by Smiley's investment group,
following up on the preliminary approval given by major league
owners in March when the picture was even fuzzier. And they will
get their new stadium, no matter how fantastic it now seems, even
as Huizenga's Florida Panthers prepare to open a new hockey arena
supported by Broward County tourist taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the contradictions are everywhere, beginning with
Huizenga's statement that the team will never get a ballpark built
with public money as long as he's the owner of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine investors reportedly aligning to buy the Marlins,
three are currently on Wayne's payroll. There's Smiley, who started
out as marketing director for Huizenga Holdings in 1985. There's
Whit Hudson, Wayne's brother-in-law and vice chairman of Huizenga's
Republic Industries. And there's Huizenga himself, whose strategy
would be to withdraw as other investors come on board.
</P>
<P>
   These potential stumbling blocks still concern me but no longer
do they cloud my vision. I have changed my mind about the Marlins
eventually getting everything they want, for the simple reason that
there is no dying in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   A change of heart, now that will be slower in coming.
</P>
<P>

Fla.

 &HT;    Memories of Detroit days good ones for Caps' Oates
 &HT;    By Brian Biggane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The first games of the Stanley Cup finals at Joe Louis
Arena marked a homecoming of sorts for Washington's Adam Oates.
</P>
<P>
   Oates, 35, was drafted as a free agent by Detroit out of
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (R.P.I.) in Troy, N.Y., in June
1985 and played four seasons with the Red Wings before being traded
to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some great memories,'' Oates said. ``Our team went to
the conference finals two years in a row (losing to Edmonton in
1987 and '88) and I really enjoyed it here. I think any player has
fond memories of his first team.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates recalled that his best friends on the Red Wings were Steve
Yzerman and Joey Kocur; Yzerman is still with the team 10 years
later while Kocur has returned after stints with the Rangers and
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved this team, and I've got great memories of that time,''
Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman recalled the point in Wings' history better than he did
Oates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a vague recollection of it,'' he said. ``What I do
remember is that was when we first started selling out the building
(Joe Louis Arena) because we were started to play better hockey.''
Detroit qualified for the playoffs only four times in the period
from 1966-86.
</P>
<P>
   Oates said his clearest memory of Detroit was when he was traded
in June 1989 for Tony McKegney and Bernie Federko.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your first trade is always tough,'' he said. ``When I was
traded it was a shock.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Shanahan hurting: Detroit coach Scotty Bowman dismissed the
problems Brendan Shanahan has been having _ Shanahan hasn't scored
in nine games _ by saying Shanahan ``might have some discomfort.''
</P>
<P>
   The word is that Shanahan, an 11-year veteran, is suffering from
a problem with a disk in his lower back and is unable to put any
torque into his shot.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bowman on summer hockey: Bowman offered some frank opinions
when asked if the season has been too long to sustain interest in
this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's interest in the two cities involved, but I'm
not sure there's much in other places,'' he said. ``I don't even
know if there's much in Montreal or Toronto. It might pick up if
the NBA finishes (tonight).
</P>
<P>
   ``But now is better than October. Then you've got the World
Series, college football is in full swing and the NFL has started
up. Now baseball is the only real competition.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Lightning acquire Janney: Tampa Bay sent left wing Louie
DeBrusk and a fifth-round pick in this month's NHL Draft to the
Phoenix Coyotes in exchange for center Craig Janney.
</P>
<P>
   Janney, who's appeared in 704 games during an 11-year career,
had 10 goals and 43 assists in 68 games for the Coyotes last
season. His most productive year was 1992-93 when he had 24 goals
and 82 assists for St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   _ Noteworthy: Since the best-of-seven format was introduced in
1939, teams that went up 2-0 had gone on to win 36-of-39 series.
... No one can accuse Leslie Wills of Mount Clemens, Mich., of not
being a diehard Wings fan. Despite having contractions five minutes
apart, Wills remained in her seat until the end of Game 1, then
gave birth four hours later.

 &HT;    One-shot wonder takes long way to easy street
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOYNTON BEACH _ Maynard Trudeau scored a basketful of money at
the NBA Finals. A quarter of a million dollars, that's what they
said. So what exactly has changed in the life of Palm Beach
County's most sudden sports celebrity?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' says Maynard, who stepped quietly out of the limo
that brought him home from Palm Beach International Airport last
Saturday night and went directly to bed. ``I'm still laying carpet,
two or three days a week. I won't stop doing that until I'm 80.''
</P>
<P>
   That's six more years as a working man. The fast life of
hobnobbing with NBA Commissioner David Stern and entertaining a
packed house at Salt Lake City's Delta Center was fun for a night
but not as a habit.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the payoff on Trudeau's successful swish shot from
three-point range in the AT&AMP;T Million-Dollar Shootout wasn't
exactly as enormous as advertised. Instead of $250,000, the amount
written on the huge cardboard check in all the photographs, Maynard
chose an option that will net him less than half.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave me a contract explaining all the rules before I ever
left home but I never got time to read it,'' Trudeau said. ``Then
after I made the shot that night, a fellow showed me how it works.
I could either take the whole amount and have it stretched out over
25 years at $10,000 a year, or I could take a lump sum of $140,000
up front.''
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau took his lump and counted himself lucky. Once the
government gets its cut, he figures there will $110,000 with which
to invest. And even if it's less, the $10,000 that's left on their
27-year-old home is no longer a concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``What difference would it have made if I had read the contract
before we left Florida?'' Trudeau asks. ``I wouldn't have stayed
home.''
</P>
<P>
   In Utah Trudeau met Stern and watched Michael Jordan play
basketball from the luxury box of Jazz owner Larry Miller. There
were dozens of TV and radio interviews to do, enough exposure to
have people recognizing Trudeau back home these days at the grocery
store and the bank and the family-priced restaurant where he ate
lunch Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, when the time came to demonstrate the underhand
shooting skill taught him by Santaluces High School basketball
coach Willie Gibson, Maynard immediately killed the suspense by
hitting the first of the five shots he was allowed under contest
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I would make one,'' said Maynard, who hit nothing but
net. ``After that, I really wasn't thinking anything at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, there has been plenty of time since to
contemplate the future. The big plans devised thus far by Maynard
and Virginia, his wife of 52 years, are as follows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a yard sale here pretty soon,'' he said.
``But I won't be putting the ball out there.''
</P>
<P>
   He's talking about a basketball signed by Jordan and Scottie
Pippen, too. That's supposed to be coming in the mail soon, along
with the money. Already half a dozen financial advisers have called
to suggest ways to spend it. The first phoned in on the night the
Trudeaus arrived home from Utah and he was in their living room the
next morning. Fast cash always brings fast action but the sharks
may go hungry here.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau says he won't buy a big-screen TV. If he takes a trip
anytime soon, it will be back to Ohio to visit family. And you can
forget seeing a new Lexus or Range Rover next to the carpet van in
the driveway of Maynard's home west of Boynton Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Lincoln of mine out there is a 1980 but it's only got
60,000 miles on it,'' he said. ``Why would I want to spend $20,000
on a new car? There's a dent or two on the one I've got but it runs
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's any dissatisfaction here, it's that Dennis Rodman
didn't slow down to sign a T-shirt that the Trudeau's granddaughter
Jennifer held out at the locker room door. That steamed Virginia,
and so did Maynard's playful suggestion that he might just dye his
snow-white crew cut a Wormy shade of green.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do and I'll put a bag over your head,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The other night Trudeau watched on television as another lucky
contest winner got a shot at a million dollars during an
intermission in the NHL Finals at Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy said he'd been practicing,'' said Trudeau, ``but he
missed the hole where he was supposed to hit the puck by 6 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Maynard for you. Been there. Won that.

 &HT;    Panthers need leadership...now
 &HT;    By Brian Biggane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The Florida Panthers were supposed to
have a coach by early June. Now it's mid-June, the expansion and
amateur drafts are less than two weeks away, and still no coach. So
what's the holdup?
</P>
<P>
   This much is clear: General Manager Bryan Murray has narrowed
his field to Dave King and his brother, Terry Murray. Both meet all
his criteria. In all likelihood, Murray has made his decision. Yet
he waits.
</P>
<P>
   Murray knows the beat writers who have covered the situation are
out of town until the Stanley Cup finals are over. When they
return, he'll make his announcement.
</P>
<P>
   And it looks very much like he'll be picking Terry Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Murray knows there will be a backlash. What you have to
admire about him is he's willing to go ahead anyway, even as he was
willing to trade Tom Fitzgerald last March for an unknown named
Mark Parrish, a deal many around the NHL are now calling a stroke
of genius.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Murray also knows he will be in the middle of a firestorm
if he's selected. Discussing the situation Saturday morning, he
emits a touch of anger and a touch of sadness that the issue
figures to be so prominent.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is it should not be brought into play very much,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, I have a resume that qualifies me to get back
into this kind of a coaching situation, and that's what needs to be
taken into account.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a fact of life that people want to work with people they
know. Bryan Murray knows Dave King; the two worked together briefly
years ago and word is they got along. But that pales in comparison
to his relationship with his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Terry and Bryan say the two _ who are eight years apart _ aren't
that close. On the other hand, Bryan once taught Terry in school,
he coached him at the end of his career, and the two were coach and
assistant on the same staff in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have a very respectful relationship, a professional
relationship,'' Terry said. ``That's the way it was for many years
in Washington, and it needs to be if it happens again.''
</P>
<P>
   As a scout for Philadelphia last season, Murray saw a lot of the
Panthers. He considers the disappointment of last season something
of an aberration and sees the pieces in place for a return to the
playoffs next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Rob) Niedermayer had an unfortunate year, and injuries like
that are a big part of why a team has a tough year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they can rebound. There's an opportunity to make a big
move. Look at Washington _ they missed the playoffs last year and
now they're in the finals. That's one things about the Eastern
Conference; the teams are so close there can be swings of four or
five positions in the standings in one year.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry has heard nothing from Bryan about his decision-making
process. Far from being disappointed, he said that's how it should
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of the candidates, and that's how I should be
treated,'' he said. ``I don't look to get privileged information
... and I don't want to be handed the position if the people down
there don't think I deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Murray is not in an enviable position. If he picks his
brother, he'll be ripped for nepotism; if he doesn't, he may be
passing over the most qualified candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing Bryan, he'll do whatever he's decided is best for the
organization. It's only a guess, but the guess here is he'll pick
Terry.

 &HT;    Money Talk: Help your kids manage money
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here's a familiar worry, one that blooms anew with
each generation: Nobody teaches the kids about money these days.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an all-purpose answer, renewable for each generation of
new parents: We have to do it ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   The schools may develop financial education classes. Banks and
mutual fund families can be counted on to market their products to
the consumers of tomorrow. Still, they are our kids, and it's up to
us.
</P>
<P>
   That comes to mind right now because it's summer, and many
youngsters are heading off to their first full-time jobs. If you
want to help them become responsible money managers, there's no
time like the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really good time to have a dress rehearsal, when the
effects won't be devastating,'' advises Neale S. Godfrey, author of
several books on teaching kids about money. ``None of us (adults)
came up with budgeting by ourselves. Why should we expect our
children to do it?''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some specifics that parents and teenagers can deal
with:
</P>
<P>
   -- Take-home pay. Everybody has to learn sometime about the
impact of taxes. The idea is to find out how much you'll take home
each week -- and what the total for the summer is. Then develop a
realistic budget.
</P>
<P>
   -- Savings objectives. ``Most teenagers don't think about
managing money,'' said Steven Sanders, a financial consultant
allied with Citibank. ``They think about spending it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to teach them,'' added Godfrey. ``You have to talk
about the fact that in real life we can't spend all our money. We
have to save and invest some.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Spending plans. The worksheet lays out the steps involved.
Note the priorities it establishes: savings first, then necessary
spending, then the fun stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey would add another category: giving to charity. ``Most
young people are incredibly willing to do that,'' she said. ``They
just never thought about it.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Parental leadership. ``You can say, 'Here's what I'd like you
to do, and I'll help you with it,''' Godfrey said. ``You can go
with them to open a bank account. You can help them study stocks
that they know about, to invest in.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Credit cards. Children of all ages have them these days.
Adults need to point out how much trouble they can lead to when not
used thoughtfully. ``Pay off what you charge each month, without
dipping into your savings,'' advises Suzanne Boas of the Consumer
Credit Counseling Service.
</P>
<P>
   -- A reality check. Midway through the summer, teenagers need to
stop and review their budget. Ask these questions: Am I saving
enough? Are expenses running higher than I budgeted? Do I need to
change my spending? It might be time, for instance, to find a
cheaper way to get to work. Or you might try renting videos, rather
than going to the movies.
</P>
<P>
   For a sensible and comprehensible elaboration of these points,
call Citibank at 1-800-669-2635 and ask for a free copy of the
leaflet ``Beach Blanket Budget.''

 &HT;    Cyberscene: Sedentary surfers can find fitness tips
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's something a little silly about turning to your
PC for advice about exercise. After all, if you didn't spend so
danged much time sitting at the keyboard, cruising the Web and
sending e-mail, you'd get outside more.
</P>
<P>
   But since the PC and the Internet are facts of life now, you
might as well use some of the resources of the World Wide Web to
find ways to get in shape.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start our Web-based exercise program easy. Just click that
mouse button -- don't strain yourself -- on http://www
</P>
<P>
   .tyrell.net/(tilde)fitness/ and zap on over to World Fitness
Online. This is a good place to start, because you'll probably
agree with the philosophy here. The notion, according to this page,
is:
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is a precious commodity, as is fitness. We want to remain
fit, but we also need time to do other things with our lives. Some
people put fitness ahead of everything else and become gym rats,
spending endless hours pumping iron, running treadmills, doing
Nautilus circuits, etc. But most of us want real lives beyond the
gym.''
</P>
<P>
   The practical nature of this page also extends to the sort of
features you'll find. If you want to get in shape without spending
a lot of money, you'll be able to follow the directions here for
constructing some of your own exercise equipment, including a
wooden stair device. It isn't as fancy as the step machines you'll
find in the gym, but you won't need to spend your hard-earned money
to get one. And, since you'll build the wooden stepper yourself,
you'll get your first exercise just from constructing it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as you'd expect, there are sections that offer exercise
advice, as well as a forum where you can leave questions for the
exercise experts who hang around this site.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop on our exercise circuit is at a place called the
Fitness Partner Connection Jumpsite. You'll find it at http://
</P>
<P>
   primusweb.com
</P>
<P>
   /fitnesspartner/. You already know that exercise alone isn't
enough for good personal fitness, so the emphasis of this site on
diet and eating the right foods will fit right in with your fitness
plan.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also get the sometimes-depressing news here of how many
calories you're burning while engaged in various exercise
activities. That's because there's a high-tech calculator that lets
you enter the information about your exercise program and get a
fairly accurate indication of the calories you burn.
</P>
<P>
   You probably know all about personal trainers. That's the rage
now at the gym. These folks help you set up an exercise plan and
health goals based on your age, weight, physical condition and
personal goals. Well, now it's time for you to meet a virtual
personal trainer that can do almost the same thing. Just head for a
site called The Fitness Zone: Fitness Profile at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .fitnesszone.com/profiles/.
</P>
<P>
   You'll fill out the on-screen form with the same kind of
information you'd give a real-world personal trainer and, in just
seconds, get an exercise profile and an assessment of your current
fitness level. You'll need to know your blood pressure to fill out
the form, but you should know that anyway, since a visit to your
physician is strongly recommended before starting any new exercise
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Since -- right or wrong -- most of us associate a fitness plan
with losing weight, you'll want to stop by a site called Shape Up
America at http://www.shapeup
</P>
<P>
   .org/sua/. That's the emphasis here, losing weight safely.
You'll find advice and support -- along with cautions about trendy
diets.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, to get started on your fitness program, perform this
low-stress exercise. Reach out with your right finger, turn off
your computer and take a walk.

 &HT;    NetW(at)atch: Pitch to Slate subscribers
 &HT;    comes straight from top
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Beware of e-mail letters from celebrities. Unless they
are personal friends of yours, chances are they want something.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case with the letter sent by Slate Editor Michael
Kinsley to the Internet magazine's 20,000 subscribers. At first
they must have thought it was kind of cool to receive a personal
note from Kinsley -- or just plain old ``Mike'' to the few, proud
Slate subscribers who paid $19.95 a year to read the online
magazine backed by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Mike's message to the flock is a chatty little note talking
about some of the improvements he'd like to make to Slate
(http://www.slate.com), such as adding more content to the
informational e-mail packages already being sent to subscribers
upon request. He's also adding new columns, including a more
frequent advice column (edited by Ann Landers' daughter, no less)
and a Wall Street insider column called ``Moneybox.'' Mike is even
planning to let readers listen in on the daily conferences between
the magazine's editors and writers, which ought to be fun. This
frenzy of content development is good news for Slate subscribers,
who will get more as part of their subscription.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually Kinsley gets to the real reason for his e-mail.
He notes with some pride the 20,000 subscribers. But as a slew of
analysts and pundits and even Slate itself readily admits, that's
not enough to keep a high-quality Web magazine afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate times call for desperate measures. Kinsley, once the
famous ``voice from the left'' on CNN's ``Crossfire,'' quotes such
famous conservatives as Fox News' Brit Hume and William F. Buckley
Jr. as saying how much they love Slate. Dark days, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   But then he moves in for the kill. It's not enough you have
subscribed to Slate. Kinsley asks you to persuade all your friends
to subscribe. Once you persuade a few people, send Slate the names
of friends who promised they'd subscribe, along with their e-mail
addresses. If you can persuade your pals to subscribe for at least
eight weeks, you'll get six months added to your own Slate
subscription. And if you don't want to hassle your friends into
subscribing, Kinsley has another idea -- give them a gift
subscription!
</P>
<P>
   Is it an outrage to send this kind of e-mail asking subscribers
to hook their friends? Not at all, says Thom Weidlich, senior
writer for Direct, a direct-marketing trade magazine. He says its
not spam because the direct-marketing pitch was sent to Slate
subscribers who have a relationship with the publication and are
used to receiving e-mail from Slate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem with the letter,'' he says. ``I have a
problem with the approach of the letter.'' He questioned how Slate
would be able to track which new subscribers were referred by which
current subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the final analysis, Kinsley's letter may be annoying,
misleading, complicated and a bit silly. But it is a bona fide way
to solicit new subscribers. It may not work, but that's one of the
things that makes Slate a charming enterprise despite its corporate
ties to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Slate's continual experimentation and willingness to admit and
learn from its mistakes is a breath of fresh air amid a sea of
content developers endlessly pretending they have all the answers.
Slate's willingness to throw almost anything up against the wall to
see if it sticks makes it one of the most interesting Web ventures
on the Web -- and nothing at all like parent company Microsoft.

 &HT;    Four plans designed to help pay off college loans
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This year's college graduates, thanks to a strong
economy, are enjoying increased job offers with good salaries --
but many graduates will soon encounter something they won't like:
repaying college loans.
</P>
<P>
   About one-half of the graduates financed part or all of their
education with student loans that average about $12,000. Repayment
for those who don't seek higher degrees is scheduled to begin in
six months.
</P>
<P>
   Because of high default rates in past years, the U.S. Department
of Education's Direct Loan Program now offers four repayment plans
for its borrowers intended to ease the ``stress'' of repayment:
</P>
<P>
   -- The Standard Repayment Plan requires the payment of a fixed
amount -- at least $50 -- each month for a period not to exceed 10
years. The length of the actual repayment period depends on the
loan total and the amount paid monthly.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Extended Repayment Plan permits fixed monthly payments
for 12 to 30 years, depending on the amount owed. Monthly payments
are lower than the standard plan -- except for a minimum payment of
$50 -- but the total paid will be more because of interest charges
for the longer period.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Graduated Repayment Plan allows lower payments at first
that gradually increase every two years over a period generally
ranging from 12 to 30 years. This is aimed at graduates who expect
their income to rise steadily as they grow older.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Income Contingent Repayment Plan bases monthly payments
on borrower's yearly income and loan amount. As income rises or
falls, so do payments. After 25 years, any remaining balance is
``forgiven,'' although taxes will be due on the amount forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on the Direct Loan Program payment options,
call 1-800-848-0979.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, other types of student loans -- including some
Federal Family Education Loan Program loans -- may be consolidated
with the Direct Loan Program to arrange for a single payment and,
perhaps, a longer payment period and lower interest. Call
1-800-557-7392 for information.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Family Education Loan Program also offers some
repayment options for its borrowers, as well as consolidation
loans. For details on Federal Family Education Loan options and
loans, call the Georgia Student Finance Authority at 770-414-3000
in metro Atlanta, or 1-800-776-6878.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has become increasingly aggressive in the
last few years with students who have failed to pay back loans, and
the default rate has fallen from about 22 percent in 1990 to 10
percent in 1995. Collection tactics include seizure of income tax
refunds and the hiring of professional debt collectors.

THE MAGIC OF A VOICE, THE UNITY OF PEOPLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the midst of summer festivals focused on political
issues (the Tibet Festival, held simultaneously in Washington)
alternative culture (the late, lost Lollapalooza), a specific
gender (Lilith Fair) and varying genres (Ozzfest, Smokin' Grooves),
the Guinness Fleadh (pronounced flah) is a festival focused on
music. Yet this stout-sponsored event, which this past weekend
visited Randalls Island for the second time, still realized an
agenda of its own. Its 60-plus acts coalesced around two romantic
notions of popular music's power: its ability to elevate solitary
voices and its magical way of bonding communities, both onstage and
in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   These themes connected the festival to its roots in Irish
culture, as it moved further from that country's folkways. The
traditional crafts and arts offered at the fair's sideshow and
smallest performance tent, the Irish Village, did allow for a
predominantly Celtic experience. But artists on the show's main
stage and in its two other tents emphasized a different shared
identity: the musician as cultural diplomat, communicating common
wisdom and banishing conflicts from the dance floor. Irish music,
split between a singing tradition that functions as oral history
and an instrumental style based in fleet, rhythmic virtuosity,
provided the context within which different performers explored
this role.
</P>
<P>
   Folk-flavored storytellers presented a number of solo sets, with
most on Saturday. An affable Richard Thompson played acoustic
guitar and pulled selections from his excellent song book, offering
witty remarks to the audience between songs. Chris Smither treated
a rapt audience to a dazzling show of Delta blues-style playing,
keeping time with his microphone-amplified foot. Loudon Wainwright
III proved as entertaining as ever, poking fun at the ubiquitous
Irish penny whistle and singing a song about taking LSD that made
use of the colorful light show available in his tent.
</P>
<P>
   Other Saturday performers played with bands, extending
individual expression outward into the audience. Tommy Makem led a
sing-along that ended with a rousing version of the Irish anthem
``Four Green Fields,'' which had some fans weeping. The English
anarchist collective Chumbawamba got the main stage crowd jumping
with ``Tubthumping,'' its smash song celebrating the resilience of
the human spirit. Jeb Loy Nichols, whose excellent band built a
sexy groove that sent many couples dancing, showed how one approach
to singing and songwriting can span several genres, from smooth
soul to lovers' rock-style reggae to country.
</P>
<P>
   Sinead O'Connor once again showed why her resolute individualism
has made her the most notable Irish pop performer, aside from
superstars U2, of her generation. Her set featured songs from
throughout her career, including a moody new ballad featuring piper
Davey Spillane. Opening her mouth wide, Ms. O'Connor let loose the
raw, haunting tones that unite rock vocalizing with age-old Irish
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, musicianly interplay took precedence over singing. Yo
La Tengo demonstrated its emotive brand of punk musicianship, while
Shane McGowan, the increasingly dissipated Irish punk pioneer,
relied on his band, as tight as he was loose, to carry his set.
Patti Smith and Joe Ely both turned to their bands to fuel their
lively dramatics. Los Lobos worked the miracle of taking subtlety
to a stadium performance with its highly inventive blend of Latin
and rock styles.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Creating a similar, but Irish-based, fusion, the Eileen Ivers
band electrified a familiar repertory. Ms. Ivers, a fiddler with
the show ``Riverdance,'' threw off reels at hardcore-punk speeds
and made her instrument sound like Jimi Hendrix's guitar. Her band
merged the Celtic and African diasporas, inspiringly expanding
Irish folk expression.
</P>
<P>
   Many Fleadh performers stretched their chosen genres, but for
sheer impact no one could beat the concentrated punk of X. The band
has returned to its original lineup, with the enigmatic Billy Zoom
on guitar, for a handful of dates. Zoom took the stage before his
band mates and was greeted with ecstatic cheers. The group's set
showed why: His solid minimalism maintained the purity of a sound
that hit upon rock's raw essentials: a fast, lurching beat secured
by drummer D.J. Bonebrake; the sexual tension between the former
spouses and co-vocalists Exene Cervenkova and John Doe, who also
plays bass; confrontational lyrics about the risky allure of modern
urban life. Summoning the drive that incited them 20 years ago, X
proved that a great band is often exactly the sum of its parts.
</P>
<P>
   The other partnership that shone at the Fleadh did not just
resurrect the past; it also crossed mortal boundaries to link two
sets of contemporary musicians with a forefather. Not long ago,
Billy Bragg, the stalwart English folk rocker, and Wilco, the
Midwestern country-rock band, were asked by Nora Guthrie, the
daughter of Woody Guthrie, to write music for some of her father's
lyrics never before set to music. The resulting songs extend
Guthrie's legacy into the millennium. In separate sets on Sunday,
Wilco and Bragg featured songs from this project.
</P>
<P>
   Bragg particularly emphasized this material, explaining each
lyric's political significance before he and his band offered their
sparkling renderings. The emotional high point came when Ms.
Guthrie joined Bragg and members of Wilco to sing one of these
miraculous collaborations. At that moment, the Guinness Fleadh
stood for more than just good sounds: It captured music's power to
preserve one compelling voice, cleaving it to the hearts of others
across time and space.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Texas town will seek justice in racial killing
 &HT;    By John Reetz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time _ just a few days ago _ that when asked of my
hometown, the talk took a long, explanatory path: a tiny town in
the pine woods, a place of dogwoods and azaleas, of hard-working,
simple, tough and honest people, of a boyhood spent playing ball in
pastures and sandlots, of friendships that endure even when contact
is absent, of relatives that go back to the town's beginning.
</P>
<P>
   It was a place where the slogan on the local weekly paper's mast
said it all: ``We Bend Our Knee to None But God.'' It's a town
named after a patriot who died in the Siege of Savannah in 1776,
and is memorialized in one of that city's downtown squares.
</P>
<P>
   It was a place my mother's family moved to in 1849, leaving
Georgia, but bringing with them the name ``Peachtree'' for the
little community they settled in just outside the town. Townspeople
knew my great-grandfather simply as ``Uncle Bob,'' remembered in
his obit as ``a kindly God fearing man ... a tireless worker'' who
cultivated a crop for 60 consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   My dad came to town with World War II, training across the river
at Camp Polk, La. He met my mother and when he survived infantry
time in Germany and the Korean War, he returned, built a house and
raised a family.
</P>
<P>
   No longer, however, is such a long detailed description needed
of my hometown.
</P>
<P>
   For my hometown is Jasper, Texas, and most have formed their own
mental image of that little town buried deep in the dark, brooding
woods of East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On June 7, James Byrd Jr., a 49-year-old black man, was killed 5
miles east of Jasper in a horrible manner: beaten into
unconsciousness, chained to the back of a pickup truck and dragged
to his death along a 3-mile stretch of rural road. Three
ex-convicts have been charged with the horrific murder, a killing
described by the Rev. Jesse Jackson as the most brutal race murder
he's seen since Mississippi, 1955.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday they buried James Byrd Jr., but the rage that crime of
hate spawns cannot _ and should not _ be buried.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in Jasper, Texas, evokes revulsion, disgust, shame
_ all the emotions that come with such crimes that not only violate
and brutalize an individual and their family, but strike against
humanity itself.
</P>
<P>
   Where does it end? None of us can even hazard a guess, for there
is rage all around, at different levels, but in too many of us.
</P>
<P>
   What drove the thinking of the person who shackled James Byrd to
the back of that pickup early on that Sunday morning?
</P>
<P>
   And think of what else has consumed us in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   What was in the mind of the carjackers who killed a Dunwoody,
Ga., youth just to steal his auto?
</P>
<P>
   And who can sort through the minds of the young gunmen who
plague our schools?
</P>
<P>
   Out of the office last week, my first clue to what happened in
Jasper came from a newspaper while waiting for an overnight flight
from San Francisco to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   As we departed, a woman in front of me pored over the article,
reading and re-reading. The headline: ``This is the most gruesome
thing I've ever heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   First, came shame that it could happen in ``my'' town. Second, a
sick feeling and a desire to put it out of my mind, and stay away
from it. But somewhere in midflight in the early morning hours, the
oddest of lyrics came to my troubled and weary mind, a song drilled
into our little brains at Sunday School at the First Baptist Church
of Jasper: ``Jesus loves the little children; All the children of
the world; Red and yellow, black and white; They are precious in
his sight; Jesus loves the little children of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   As children, we learned by rote, but it made sense when we were
old enough to understand the words.
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, the national press was in Jasper, and we saw the
suspects walk out of the Jasper County courthouse, headed for jail.
It was on that courthouse lawn that George Custer camped with his
troops during Reconstruction. It was on that lawn that I'd go with
my dad to watch as they wrote election results on a gigantic
chalkboard. It was on that lawn that my high school band played
Christmas concerts, and around that square each May would come the
annual Rodeo Parade, a huge assemblage of bands, horses, clowns,
wagons and floats announcing the start of the annual rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother lived just a block down the street; down the
street the other way I went to church. And over the other direction
a block was The Jasper News-Boy, the little weekly where I got my
start, working for free before I got a raise to $3 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from that courthouse lawn was the Texas
Theater, where I saw ``The Ten Commandments'' with my mother, and
on the same block were Hancock Drug Store and Henderson Drug Store,
where we gathered for cherry Cokes.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway down the block from the courthouse was the Jasper Bake
Shop, and the man who baked the lightest donuts I've ever had
worked there when I was in high school. His name was Zeke Spikes,
and he had a son my age, named Warren.
</P>
<P>
   When the federal government instituted its ``Freedom of Choice''
option before full integration, Warren came to Jasper High School
along with two other black students. Those three became the first
to graduate from the previously segregated Jasper High School. It
made so much sense then, back in 1968, so why do we still struggle
with race issues?

   Before coming to the white school, blacks attended Rowe High
School, a school in the old Texas Negro Interscholastic League.
Rowe's football team was generally 10-0 and playoff-bound and the
white school's record was generally 0-10 or 1-9. When I worked at
the News-Boy, it was more fun to cover Rowe.
</P>
<P>
   Get the picture now about Jasper?
</P>
<P>
   If you grew up in any rural area in the '60s, you can relate to
practically everything you know now of Jasper. You probably skipped
school, too, raced tractors through pastures, had a few illegal
beers from the bootlegger on occasion and the Louisiana state line
on other occasions, struggled with the transition from a flattop to
a mild pony tail in the late `60s and early `70s, went off to
college and vowed never to return. Then missed it the rest of your
life.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the commonalities with any other rural town of that
time, the horrific crime against James Byrd Jr., his family, his
town, this country makes Jasper stand out, and will put it to a
test.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more visible figures as the case unfolds will be
District Attorney Guy James Gray. My memories are of Guy James as
second baseman on the school baseball team. In the first days after
the crime, he and Sheriff Billy Rowles were most visible, as Rowles
asked that Jasper not be judged for this act alone.
</P>
<P>
   Can Jasper, as it seeks justice for Byrd, be the place that the
line is drawn in the sand on racism and hatred, as it was at the
Alamo a century and a half ago on behalf of Texas liberty?
</P>
<P>
   Can it be where we all say enough is enough?
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Jackson, in town for Byrd's funeral, preached
reconciliation, not retribution, and said he saw a relationship
between whites and blacks that he usually doesn't see in such
cases. Jasper's reaction, Jackson said, ``set a standard for the
nation...In this town blacks and whites have come together like
nothing I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison talked of the stoic reaction of
Byrd's family and the example they set for others.
</P>
<P>
   Stoicism is nothing new to Deep East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   These are people who work hard, don't earn a lot of money, are
independent-minded, loving but cautious, and quiet, not boastful.
Their ancestors had a hard life, coming to these dark woods from
Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama and elsewhere, living always on the
edge of the frontier. As a result, they know how to put up with a
lot, and wait for the bad to pass.
</P>
<P>
   That stoicism, that tenacity will help Byrd's family carry on,
and it will help Guy James Gray and the rest of the town seek
justice in his name.
</P>
<P>
   West of Jasper there is a grown-over family cemetery, where my
great-grandmother's grave is topped with a tombstone that says it
all about a frontier woman: ``She Hath Done What She Could.''
</P>
<P>
   May we all commit to the same as Jasper, and this country, does
what it can to seek out the good in the aftermath of this tragedy.

 &HT;    Ernest Holsendolph's Business Commentary: BellSouth's plan for
wireless TV intrigues viewers
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When BellSouth announced that it is offering something
fresh, television over the air to the tune of some 160 channels,
the news created an instant buzz. BellSouth was positively
overwhelmed. But for cable TV operators, the outpouring of interest
in BellSouth's news had to carry a sobering message.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of folks out there were saying, I don't know what this
wireless television is, but whatever it is, I want to give it a
chance. Anybody but cable!
</P>
<P>
   There is even the view that, true to BellSouth's commercials and
marketing, people are beginning to view the phone company as the
epitome of reliability and service.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't it only yesterday that Lily Tomlin had us rolling with
her sharp needles at Ma Bell: ``I'm from the phone company and I
don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Images change.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the phone company Miss Tomlin was lampooning does not
really exist anymore. It was the Ma Bell that let us choose some
colors and touch tones, but offered far too few alternative
services. Now, BellSouth and cable officials agree, the excitement
is over the idea of competition.
</P>
<P>
   For all we know, the outpouring of calls that flooded the
BellSouth staff may have been principally curiosity -- a desire to
know more about this new service, and to know if it would be
available in particular neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   John Hartman, vice president of BellSouth Entertainment, said
there were actually three primary areas of inquiry by callers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people said they simply wanted a service provided by
BellSouth, showing some attraction to the brand,'' said Hartman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others were looking for what we call 'tonnage,' some means to
get a huge package of entertainment that they could sift through to
find what pleases them,'' Hartman said. ``Still others, maybe the
most technically knowledgeable, were looking for digital quality,
regardless of cost, so they could get a clearer picture than they
normally get.''
</P>
<P>
   He made it clear that the seekers of ``tonnage'' were not
necessarily couch potatoes, who plop down and watch hours of TV
each evening. Rather, they were most likely to be busy people, who
want to go directly to subject matters that tie into their
lifestyles or interests.
</P>
<P>
   Among those people are many newcomers to Atlanta, who came from
communities with broader selections of channels and are highly
disappointed that the limited choices here do not include certain
information channels, a well-displayed weather radar, or a nimble
navigational system that lets the viewer know instantly what's on
each channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would be amazed at how passionate people get over TV
programming,'' Hartman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And beyond TV, many people want the 30-channel package of
digital stereo music of all kinds, ranging from classical to
popular and jazz.'' Actually MediaOne and others offer the music
package, but in some cases separately, with a special box apart
from the channel tuner.
</P>
<P>
   Because many of the newcomers did not find their favorite
channels on existing cable, they immediately turned their backs on
local companies and tried satellite TV, only to be disappointed by
certain limitations such as lack of local channels.
</P>
<P>
   And so did all this have ears burning over at local operators
like MediaOne?
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely have had plenty of meetings about this,'' said
Reg Griffin, MediaOne spokesman. ``We know that we have not been
able to upgrade the system fast enough to meet the expectations of
many customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we also know there are people out there just waiting for
all this promised competition that they heard would come with the
new communications legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne still has, in a sense, two steps to take before it can
match what BellSouth is offering many Atlantans now. It must first
complete its upgrade of the cable systems it operates in vast
reaches of Atlanta, and then it can turn to offering ``a digital
tier'' of services that would roughly compare to the 160-channel
service being rolled out by BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company will be able to accommodate everybody this year.
MediaOne must complete its upgrade, and BellSouth must figure out
ways to reach more homes of Atlantans who live on hills and in
valleys in this tree-shrouded city.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne has one sure advantage. Eventually it will be able to
reach, with improvements, virtually 100 percent of the customers
the service passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident our digital picture will match theirs,'' said
Griffin. ``And we will also have the advantage of two-way
communication, including phone service and Internet connections. We
are confident we will be all right.''

`THE REAL WORLD': ANOTHER SEASON SHOWING TV'S GRIP ON SOCIETY
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By CARYN JAMES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For children of the media age, who have grown up with
MTV and ``Entertainment Tonight,'' the idea of living your life in
front of a camera may not be astonishing. That's one reason MTV
cutting-edge series ``The Real World,'' which begins its seventh
season Tuesday at 10 (check local listing), is central to the
suddenly hot topic of how television and reality shape each other.
</P>
<P>
   More than ``The Truman Show,'' a wafer-thin hit movie pretending
to be profound, and more than all the orchestrated ``Jerry
Springer'' brawls put together, ``The Real World'' blurs the line
between television and private life. More telling, it accepts that
fuzzy line as a given.
</P>
<P>
   In the show, which MTV calls a ``reality-based soap opera,'' men
and women in their early 20s live in a house together for six
months and are trailed by cameras everywhere. Each season offers a
different cast of seven roommates in a different city. This season
happens to be set in Seattle, but that's a detail; so are the
people. The revolving door of characters works because the series'
appeal is the irresistible pull of watching lives, any lives,
unfold without a script.
</P>
<P>
   This is the genuine ``Truman Show,'' but it makes more sense
because the people on camera know they're being filmed and welcome
the attention. ``The Real World'' offers a touchstone of our
culture's connection to the screen: everyone wants to be on
television. And though the series obviously comes from a long
cinema verite tradition, its media-bred young people see no
difference between acting out their lives before a camera and
simply living them.
</P>
<P>
   Their youth has a lot to do with that inbred attitude, and with
the series' energy. College age or just beyond, the roommates
grapple with the spill-it-out issues that obsess people beginning
to find their way. Each cast is selected, it seems, to insure
maximum tension: there are love interests, racial strife,
adolescent navel-gazing, job hunting and, one season, even
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday night's episode the roommates move into a huge
pier-side house furnished to resemble an adult playground. There is
a rock-climbing wall, exercise equipment, an aquarium, a kitchen
counter with stools that looks like a retro diner. The roommates
include two cadets from Virginia Military Institute: Nathan has
left behind a girlfriend who was not chosen for the show and whines
to him endlessly on the phone; David is from a tough neighborhood
outside Boston. Stephen is the only black roommate. Janet is close
to her ambitious Asian-American family. Lindsay is loud and bouncy;
Rebecca a quiet blonde; Irene witty but guarded. They all have been
given jobs at a Seattle radio station.
</P>
<P>
   A shrewd, suspense-enhancing, voyeuristic touch is that anyone
who watched last week's ``Real World Casting Special'' on MTV,
which followed how the roommates were chosen, knows more about them
than they do about one another right now. Of the 14,000 people who
applied to appear on the show, 120 were interviewed as
semi-finalists. In their one-on-one interviews with the casting
directors, Rebecca revealed that she longs to have a family, but is
still a virgin terrified of sex. We also know that Stephen was
raised as a Muslim but converted to Judaism. The yarmulke he wore
in one scene of the casting special has not yet appeared in the
Seattle house.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the characters talk directly to the camera behind
their roommates' backs, which further blurs the line between living
for the screen and for themselves. The camera becomes one more
friend to complain to or confide in.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the first episode, friendships and tensions are forming.
Stephen and Rebecca feel hurt when the rest of the cast goes to a
bar they can't get into because they are under 21. Someone leaves a
page of a diary lying around, which includes a complaint about the
homogeneous white middle-class makeup of the cast. Stephen, whom
Nathan calls ``the black guy,'' is the obvious suspect, but the
writer turns out to be David, and the issue a matter of class not
race.
</P>
<P>
   The cast's youth, and the show's relatively advanced age, are
factors that have likely caused ``The Real World'' to be ignored in
all the ``Truman''-provoked discussions about television's grip on
society. And people beyond the age of the cast members may not find
their problems intriguing for more than five minutes at a time. But
dipping in and out of other people's lives is precisely what the
current television culture is about.
</P>
<P>
   It is a culture in which being wary of the camera seems bizarre.
At the end of the ``Real World Casting Special,'' cameras watch as
some finalists get phone calls telling them whether they have been
selected. Irene says she threatened the camera crew: If she hadn't
been chosen, they were not leaving with their film. She also says
she became more nervous after having been selected for the show,
more aware that anything she says can turn up on screen. She may be
too thoughtful for the role.

   In the days after the Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune
in 1870-71, Manet, Monet and other Impressionists were attracted to
the Quartier de l'Europe around the Saint-Lazare station in Paris,
where they practiced their art. Some of the results are on view
through Sept. 20 in ``Manet, Monet and the Gare Saint-Lazare'' at
the National Gallery in Washington. Nearly 40 paintings, drawings
and prints include all 11 Monet paintings of the station, exhibited
together for the first time.

   Film is generally regarded as a director's medium, but at the
Nantucket Film Festival, which begins Tuesday, screenwriters, who
often get short shrift, are going to get their due. The event, on
Nantucket Island, was created to celebrate original voices in film
and to explore the art of screenwriting, and the third annual
festival, through Sunday, includes for the first time a Writer's
Tribute, sponsored by NBC, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The honoree is Ring Lardner Jr., who won Oscars for ``Woman of
the Year'' (1942) and MASH (1970) and was one of the Hollywood 10,
who defied the House Committee on Un-American Activities in the
1940s. He was imprisoned and blacklisted during its hunt for

   NEW YORK _ Lorna Luft will serve as co-host with Robert Stack
and sing ``San Francisco'' and ``The Man That Got Away.'' Bebe
Neuwirth will sing ``Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart.'' And
there will be contributions by everyone from Lionel Bart, Betty
Comden, Adolph Green and Lea DeLaria to Nancy Dussault, Gogi Grant,
Robert Goulet, Skitch Henderson, Jack Jones, Alan King, Robert
Morse and Elaine Stritch. And that's not all who are scheduled to
turn out at 7:30 Tuesday night and Wednesday night at Carnegie
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is: Who could call forth such an army of
talent? The answer is: Judy Garland. The occasion is ``Carnegie
Hall Celebrates the Music of Judy Garland,'' two different programs
that recall Garland's sold-out concerts at Carnegie in the spring
of 1961. The performances, with original orchestrations,
reminiscences and film clips, are the hall's fourth annual
``American Popular Song Celebration,'' surveying the work of a
particular artist, song style or composer.

`MY HEART LAID BARE': INTRIGUE INSTEAD OF INSIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.)  
(ja) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In ``My Heart Laid Bare,'' her ponderous new novel,
Joyce Carol Oates returns to the landscape of genre fiction she
explored with uneven success in such earlier books as
``Bellefleur,'' ``A Bloodsmoor Romance'' and ``Mysteries of
Winterthurn.'' This time, we are given an old-fashioned family
saga, dressed up with the usual Gothic curlicues, the usual
heavy-breathing prose and some added ``Ragtime''-esque pretensions.
</P>
<P>
   The Licht family, we quickly learn, is a clan of con men
indoctrinated in their patriarch's Nietzschean credo. ``All men are
our enemies, as they are strangers,'' Abraham Licht tells his
children. Life is a Darwinian game, in his view, in which the rules
are very simple: ``No success without another's failure./ No
failure without another's success./ To feel another's pain is
defeat./ To turn the other cheek, a betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham's greedy scheming drives the plot of ``My Heart Laid
Bare,'' creating a narrative that's basically a succession of con
jobs within con jobs, scams piled upon scams, from fixed horse
races and daring holdups to sophisticated investment setups and
hokey medical treatments: a Mametian smorgasbord of confidence
schemes, served up in turn-of-the-century dress and garnished with
some typical Oatesian gore, including several murders and the
grisly mutilation of a corpse.
</P>
<P>
   The cynical me-firstism of the Lichts, however, is not merely a
narrative device. It's also supposed to be a metaphor for
untrammeled capitalistic greed, for American selfishness and
ambition. Abraham's refusal to think about the consequences of his
actions mirrors Americans' penchant for living in the moment, just
as his faith in the ``cash value'' of an idea symbolizes Americans'
entrepreneurial zeal.
</P>
<P>
   To drive this point home, Ms. Oates stuffs this already
overstuffed book with lots of heavy-handed asides. ``This is the
American credo _ I'm being cheated!'' she writes in one chapter.
``Somebody else, anybody else, is doing better than I am; deserving
no more, but reaping far more than I am; life cheats me, or other
men cheat me, or women; I have yet to receive my due, and never
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as she's pontificating in exclamatory, italic-heavy prose,
Ms. Oates is busy turning her characters' lives into a historical
echo chamber. The Lichts are constantly running into famous
historical figures (Abraham, for one, gets a job with the Harding
administration and socializes with the likes of the Astors) while
playing out their domestic dramas against the backdrop of huge
public events like World War I, Prohibition and the stock market
crash of 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oates' efforts to make the Licht family representative of
the 20th century, however, severely test the limits of
plausibility. Abraham's con jobs take him from Wall Street to
Washington and have him dabbling in everything from psychiatry and
fertility treatments to advertising and the federal surveillance of
subversives. One of his sons goes west to test himself _ and an
unsuspecting mark _ on a Teddy Roosevelt-like adventure in the
wilderness. Another reinvents himself as a born-again evangelist in
the South, and a third becomes a musical prodigy who plays Carnegie
Hall. One daughter becomes a wealthy matron, traveling in the
snootiest social circles, while her younger sister becomes a
feminist crusader with the American Birth Control League.
</P>
<P>
   As if this were not enough, Ms. Oates has Abraham adopt a black
child, who grows up to become an Afrocentric revolutionary,
preaching a doctrine of separatism and hate in the most cliched and
racially stereotyped of terms.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, every character in ``My Heart Laid Bare'' comes
across as a stereotype or cliche: Abraham as a maniacal patriarch,
his son Harwood as a violent bully, his daughter Millie as a
manipulative flirt, and so on and so on and so on.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier novels like ``You Must Remember This'' and ``Because
It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart,'' Ms. Oates used her
mastery of social and psychological detail to flesh out her
characters' lives and situate them in a richly imagined matrix of
relationships; as a result, their actions, however melodramatic,
felt believable and authentic. Here, in contrast, she has
substituted incident and intrigue for emotional insight, sweeping
historical vistas for a carefully observed social context, and her
characters' actions, consequently, feel arbitrary and contrived.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to understand why Abraham's children rebel against him
one moment and re-embrace him the next, just as it's hard to
understand why they choose the professions (or mock-professions)
that they do. Abraham's own fluctuations in mood and persona
similarly make him seem like the author's puppet, pulled hither and
thither by whim. Although Ms. Oates speaks repeatedly in this book
_ as she so often does _ of destiny and fate, the trajectory of her
characters' lives feels less like the inevitable working out of
familial and societal imperatives than the poorly thought-out
manipulations of an author bored by her own pallid creations.

SCIENCE'S DEFINING MOMENT  
 HARD TIMES FOR GORILLAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Md.)   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Science, it seems, defies description. At least that's what the
American Physical Society discovered when it set out to try to
define the term.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out to be not that easy,'' Robert L. Park, a physics
professor at the University of Maryland, said of the effort by a
small group of members. What they came up with ``was not a bad
definition,'' he said. ``But it was really a definition written for
other scientists.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not what they had in mind. The purpose, Park said, was
to provide a simple definition to help the public sort science from
nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Every scientific society, he said, is concerned with ``the
frightening growth of antiscience and pseudoscience and all sorts
of wacky substitutes for science.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly worrisome to the American Physical Society are some
of the claims of alternative medicine, which, Park said, ``violate
the principles of physics.'' A solid definition of what science is
would make it easier for the society to refute such claims.
</P>
<P>
   But the group's statement proved to be far from straightforward.
``We used words like `falsifiable,' which the public is confused
by,'' Park said. ``They're words that philosophers of science love
to use.'' He said that the group would try again, this time
enlisting other scientific societies to write a consensus
definition.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps science is like pornography, as described by Justice
Potter Stewart in a 1963 Supreme Court case. Stewart wrote that he
wouldn't bother to define hard-core smut, but that ``I know it when
I see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But the fact that some legitimate scientists have
endorsed spurious pseudoscientific claims, Park said, makes it
important to try to define the term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there are even some scientists who don't know it
when they see it,'' he said.

   The lowland eastern gorillas live in turbulent times. A civil
war in their home nation, Congo, has left many guns in the hands of
poachers, and people are encroaching on the gorillas' forests. A
recent survey of the gorilla territory, which spans about 35,000
square miles, found that most of the animals are holding their own
for now, but their survival is becoming more precarious.
</P>
<P>
   The lowland eastern, or Grauer's, gorillas have generally not
received the attention paid to western and mountain gorillas
because they live in such inaccessible areas. The logistics of the
Grauer's gorilla survey, published in the April issue of the
journal Oryx and conducted from 1994 to 1996, required the planning
of a military excursion.
</P>
<P>
   To keep from disturbing the gorillas, researchers counted nests,
then tracked at least three gorillas to verify that the nests were
fresh. ``You could often see a little smooth place in a nest that
was a small bed for an infant,'' said Ilambu Omari, a biologist at
Kahuzi-Biega National Park, where many of the animals live.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildlife Conservation Society, based at the Bronx Zoo, paid
for most of the research, working with Congo's park service.
</P>
<P>
   While gorillas seem to be doing relatively well in parks, groups
in other areas, like Kasese, have been thinned by hunting.
Kahuzi-Biega staff members need only look at one of their
favorites, a gorilla named Lamb Chop who is missing a hand, to be
reminded of how wire snares set by hunters are maiming gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   In the mountainous eastern end of Kahuzi-Biega, more people are
moving into the gorillas' forests to flee areas largely stripped of
trees during the sojourn of Rwandan refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are worried,'' Omari said. ``Everyone speaks of human
rights, and that is good. But the gorillas have a right to survive,
too. They are suffering.''

 &HT;      RIDGE CALLS ON FATHERS TO STAY HOME
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Paul Kane  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, June 15 -- Gov. Tom Ridge railed against the plague
of absentee fathers Monday and called on federal and state
governments to push for more grants to private, community-based
groups that could teach today's youths the importance of parenting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, any male can father a child. But it takes a real man
to be a father to a child,'' the Republican governor told the
Second National Summit on Fatherhood, a meeting of some of the
leading public and private male figures in Washington assembled to
come up with ideas make young fathers more responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge appeared with a cross section of figures, including Vice
President Al Gore, representatives from the Promise Keepers and
Robert Goodwin, executive director of the National Points of Light
Foundation, which was founded by President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that nearly four out of 10 children ``will go to sleep at
night in a home without a father,'' Ridge said fatherless children
are five times more likely to live in poverty and they make up 70
percent of violent, long-term violent criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we address the crisis of family, specifically father
absent families, the promise of a better, brighter tomorrow will
not be part of the personal dream of hundreds of thousands of our
children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His recipe for the problem relied on community efforts backed up
with state grants, similar to Pennsylvania's mentoring grants
designed to teach teens how to be a father. He cited the Fathers
Workshop in Erie and the Young Fathers Workshop in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   But Ridge's proposals came laced with some ideological rhetoric
as he pushed conservative approaches, saying there should not be
any new government programs to run these outreach efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government can't love. Government can't nurture. Government
can't teach your child to ride a bike, help with homework, or wipe
away the tears after a scraped knee,'' he said. ``There has never
been, nor will ever be, a well intentioned government program that
can be a surrogate or a substitute for a father who loves a
child.''

WONDER BREAD SUED FOR DISCRIMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LANCE WILLIAMS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Fifteen black employees of Wonder Bread have
filed a racial discrimination lawsuit against the nation's largest
bakery, saying Wonder's small African-American workforce here is
subject to a steady barrage of racial jokes and insults.
</P>
<P>
   In their complaint, the 15 men _ who say they represent nearly
half of all the blacks the company employs in the San Francisco
area _ say Wonder's local operation is so inhospitable to black
workers that it's known as ``the White House.'' The workers are
seeking $260 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, the company refuses to hire new black
employees in San Francisco and won't promote the ones it has. The
suit contends that black workers are given worse jobs and cut far
less slack than other employees.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a rule that bans blacks _ but not members of other
racial groups _ from talking to one another or ``congregating,''
the lawsuit says.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder's parent, Kansas City, Mo.-based Interstate Brands Corp.,
says it strives to maintain a workplace that is free from racial
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Dirkes, Interstate Brands' senior vice president, said the
company was aware of the lawsuit but could not comment on
specifics.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``We're clearly an equal opportunity employer, and
we don't tolerate discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Interstate Brands is a $3 billion-per-year food giant with 63
regional bakeries, making it the nation's largest baker. In
addition to Wonder Bread, it makes Home Pride bread and Hostess
cupcakes.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in San Francisco Superior Court by former
San Francisco Supervisor Angela Alioto, the lawyer representing the
men.
</P>
<P>
   According to the suit, Wonder employs 683 workers in the San
Francisco area. Of them, 31 are black.
</P>
<P>
   The company's management in the San Francisco area includes no
blacks, the lawsuit says, and except for one bakery foreman, every
African-American employee of Wonder Bread is still in an
entry-level job, it claims. One man, plaintiff Winston Foote, has
been in an entry-level job in the bakery's sanitation department
for 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the company has hired only a handful of black
workers, the complaint says. Foote alleged in the lawsuit that when
he asked why blacks weren't being hired, a supervisor responded,
``They are too lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is peppered with allegations of discriminatory
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Theodis Carroll, 32, contended in the suit that soon after he
went to work in the bread-wrapping room in 1995, it became evident
that blacks were being singled out for bad treatment.
</P>
<P>
   White and Latino workers were permitted longer breaks than
blacks, and received better on the-job training, he said. Black
workers also tended to be assigned to work at bread-wrapping
machines that were older and more prone to breakdown, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll alleged that at one point, management ordered black
workers not to ``congregate'' in the bakery, citing a fear of
gangs. No such rule was enforced against other races, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't like for the blacks to get together and talk, but
the white guys are sitting down there on the floor (of the bakery)
and that's OK,'' he said. ``Me, I like to talk to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the company did nothing to stop supervisors from using
racially tinged or abusive language.

 YOUTH TO REJUVENATE OUR AILING NATIONAL PARKS  (EDITOR'S NOTE:

Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First Amendment
commentary. His e-mail address is levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)  By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY

<P>
   National Park Service Director Robert Stanton promised to
involve more young people in the park system when he accepted the
top parks job last year. This month, he took a giant step toward
keeping that promise.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last August, Stanton said, `I believe it's
critically important that we work with youth-serving organizations
... to give our youth the opportunity to experience their own
national parks ... It helps them to become better citizens in terms
of greater appreciation of their own natural and cultural
heritage.`
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, the NPS kicked off a Public Land Corps Youth Program
with restoration work on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National
Historic Park in Maryland. Fifty young people from the Student
Conservation Association and the Montgomery County Conservation
Corps began clearing out the woody vegetation from culverts and
locks of the canal. And this is only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   In this first year, more than $3 million has been committed for
much needed maintenance projects in our national parks. This year
nearly 100 national parks will be involved in the program that will
rebuild trails, restore campgrounds and cabins, and remove
non-native vegetation and trash from campsites.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Stanton commented on the new program:
`This is a tremendous opportunity to expand the involvement of
young people in conservation, resource preservation, and
maintenance work in our parks.`
</P>
<P>
   Some of the money for the program comes from the recreational
fee demonstration program that allows the National Park Service to
retain revenues generated _ to be used for repairs and maintenance
projects. The recreational fee program, according to Stanton, will
generate an estimated $135 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   `We wanted to actively engage other youth-serving organizations
in a partnership, in which they could bring their expertise, their
leadership skills, as well as some of their resources to the park
programs,` Stanton said. `For each park there is a partnership
organization involved. For example, in Yellowstone National Park
(Wyo.) we will have young people working on projects and they will
be recruited by and supervised by the Montana Conservation Corps.
</P>
<P>
   `We envision this as long term _ to continue to involve the
young people in the Public Land Corps ... work that is commensurate
with the capabilities of the young people _ doing trail
rehabilitation, sign rehabilitation, and other maintenance work
that is critically important, but lends itself to a day-to-day
staff as opposed to a major contract. The program gives us an
opportunity to match up the need with the capability of the young
people.`
</P>
<P>
   In Yellowstone, one Public Land Corps project will restore and
reroute DeLacy Creek Trail, one of the most heavily used hiking
trails in the park. The condition of the trail has seriously
deteriorated over the years. Hikers using the trail in the spring
when parts of it are under creek water end up tramping and
destroying sensitive wetlands areas.
</P>
<P>
   Before the end of June, an eight person crew from the Montana
Conservation Corps will be working alongside and supervised by a
NPS trail crew to relocate the trail away from DeLacy Creek and
important riparian areas. The project is scheduled to take no more
than six weeks to complete.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of other PLC projects scheduled for
Yellowstone _ restoration and stabilization of campgrounds and
other trails and repairing or removing fences _ in partnership with
the Student Conservation Association and the Youth Conservation
Corps.
</P>
<P>
   PLC projects in 40 states and the District of Columbia will
begin this month _ including restoration and repair projects in
Redwood National Park (Calif.), Grand Canyon National Park (Ariz.),
Dinosaur National Monument (Colo.), Craters of the Moon National
Monument (Idaho), Glacier National Park (Mont.), Bryce Canyon
National Park (Utah), Blue Ridge Parkway (Va.), and Mount Rainier
National Park (Wash.).
</P>
<P>
   Youth from the Sitka Tribe will repair eroded trails in the
Sitka National Historic Park in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Eight students from the Rocky Mountain Youth Corps will work to
reconstruct eroded trails in the Rocky Mountain National Park in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   A community service group called the Juvenile Diversion Program,
aimed at preventing youth crime and violence in small Colorado
towns, will help fight the spread of non-native vegetation in the
Great Sand Dunes National Monument by pulling the exotic plants out
by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers from the Youth Conservation Corps will assist in
restoring an historic cabin in Yosemite National Park's back
country in California.
</P>
<P>
   Youth corps query national parks nearby to find out what backlog
maintenance or restoration needs to be done. Corps officials write
grant requests for PLC funding for a particular work project in the
national park. If the request is authorized, the youth corps then
accepts volunteers and supervises them under the direction of park
rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Each youth group in the PLC partnership pays its student workers
differently _ some only pay living expenses, then after the work is
completed, an educational stipend of nearly $5,000 for a year
commitment or half that for a six-month commitment. But there are
youth programs that pay minimum wage for participating in
conservation projects that last only four to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   More than a thousand young people from the ages of 16 to 20 will
participate in helping restore our national parks this year. While
that number is relatively small, it is only the beginning of a new
kind of investment in our youth and in our national parks.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bold move that highlights the best spirit of our youth
and entrusts the future of one of the great heritages of this
nation to their willing and able hands.

 &HT;    COLUMN:30 years after Dr. King's death: Have things changed that
much?
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--On Saturday afternoon, while most people were out
enjoying the weekend, she holed up in her room at a Atlanta hotel,
a New Yorker writing a freelance article for a newspaper in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Mentally if not physically, Tamar Jacoby has been bounding back
and forth, from New York to Detroit to Atlanta, for several years
now. In her mind the three cities form a triangle of American
tragedy. Each in its own way is representative not only of
Americans' disenchantment with integration but, even more, an
acceptance of a new racial separatism.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to work this way. The legal barriers of the
past are museum pieces, as strange to our eyes as a ``Whites only''
sign, and yet we're as divided as ever. In some ways, more so. How
often do you hear people talking hopefully, optimistically of
integration? Thirty years after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s
assassination, that dream's been given up.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Tamar Jacoby visited the Martin Luther King Visitors
Center on Auburn Avenue. She spent time in the hallowed Ebenezer
Baptist Church, cradle of the civil rights movement. She had been
there before, researching her recently published book ``Someone
Else's House: America's Unfinished Struggle for Integration'' (Free
Press).
</P>
<P>
   At the church, a nine-minute videotape highlighted its history
before King's emergence and after. The church's pastor, the Rev.
Joseph L. Roberts, spoke earnestly of King's gospel of nonviolence.
Across the street, at the Visitors Center, photos, films and other
exhibits memorialized the same gospel and recorded the angry
resistence it met in Selma and Birmingham, in rural Mississippi, in
a Chicago suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in this quiet church, at this museum, you had a sense of
history in a city that otherwise hasn't much time for history. Yet
in neither church nor museum was there unambiguous emphasis on what
King's gospel was really about: Laying down once and for all the
burden of race and living together as one people.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our heart of hearts,'' Jacoby said, King said that
underneath, we're basically the same; Malcolm said we're basically
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby was in town on a book tour, her local stops including a
signing Monday night at Chapter 11 bookstore in the Ansley Mall.
She is a slender, sharp-featured woman in her early 40s, a New
Yorker by upbringing and a former deputy editor of The New York
Times op-ed page. Like many in her generation, she came of age in
the civil rights movement and regarded King as a figure who
transcended his time.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the late 1950s, when King came along,'' Jacoby says,
``things were starting to change. People knew segregation was
wrong. But King took it a huge leap forward. He crystallized the
vision of people, the ideal of one communty, which is a lot more
than just getting rid of the legal barriers. It was almost as if we
had overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost ... But somewhere we lost our way. We became persuaded
that the ideal was not, in King's words, ``a beloved community,''
rooted in mutuality, but instead something called ``diversity,''
each group wary of the other, each properly respectful of
unbridgeable ``differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby's reservoirs of optimism are deep, but not bottomless.
She tells of a course she taught last year at a college in New
York. Many of her students were black, not the familiar products of
the inner city but young people reared in middle class families.
Their future held promise. But even they, she said, saw the
classroom as another expression of a ``white culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them told me, `When we come in here we have to leave
our culture behind,''' Jacoby says, mystified. ``I asked, `How can
that be? Why do learning and studying have to be cultural
things?'''
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Jacoby makes New York, Detroit and Atlanta test
cases in the evolution of race relations, Atlanta because it was
here more than anywhere that King's dream should have been
realized. It had always been a biracial city, one that had largely
avoided ugly confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   But even here, in the city where it was born, King's dream has
meant a kind of peaceful coexistence. ``Deep down,'' one black
professional told her, ``the black middle class in Atlanta is still
integrationist.'' A middle-class white man told her: ``That
spiritual, theological strain in the civil right movement in our
way, we hold on to that.''
</P>
<P>
   What was unsaid was that both white and black are at impasse,
like spouses who have had a falling out, neither wanting to give up
the marriage, both hoping the other will come forward in
reconciliation. Two people can live in the same house without
making a home together.

 &HT;    Magazine picks best places to live
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're a twentysomething looking for a place to settle, check
out this month's issue of Swing ($2.95). The Gen-X mag lists the
country's 10 hottest urban centers and the three best areas in each
city to live. In Atlanta, Swing selected East Atlanta as the best
bet, followed by Decatur and Cabbagetown. East Atlanta Village,
near Grant Park, is described as a multicultural neighborhood of
gay, straight, Latino, African-American and Caucasian where starter
houses cost $65,000 to $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   SURF'S UP: This week's Entertainment Weekly ($2.50) has a full
page touting its new EW Internet supplement, but not all of the
magazines have the insert. None of the newsstand issues have it and
only 400,000 of EW's subscribers. ``We've targeted the subscriber
list according to our research as to who is online,'' says EW
publicist Sandy Drayton. ``But anyone who wants to get a free copy
of EW Internet issue can register on our website
(http://www.ew.com) or by calling 800-828-6882.''
</P>
<P>
   Drayton says EW Internet _ a miniature version of the magazine _
will be devoted to online and multimedia articles. Included in the
first issue are a critique of the games unveiled at the recent
Eleectronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta and a guide to the best
entertainment web sites. The next insert will appear in September,
with six supplements scheduled for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   BEHIND PALACE WALLS: Interest in monarchies waned a bit after
the death of Princess Diana, but the fascination with kings and
queens and sheikhs and princesses is still strong. While giving
special attention to Prince William, Life ($3.95) devotes this
week's issue to 28 monarchies around the world. Included is a
genealogical chart that traces the 10 heirs of Europe back to one
17th-century German prince.
</P>
<P>
   IS THE TRUTH OUT THERE? When it comes to keeping secrets, the
federal government could take some lessons from Chris Carter.
According to Newsweek's ($2.95) cover story, the creator of ``The
X-Files'' was so obsessed with maintaining secrecy around the movie
that scripts were printed on non-copyable red paper. Phony pages
were leaked and disinformation spread over the Internet. One rumor
that is not true, Carter tells Newsweek, is that Duchovny fans will
get a naked rear view of him in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate issue this week, Newsweek celebrates a century of
movies with a list of the American Film Institute's 100 greatest
American movies of all time. The magazine, which hits newsstands
Wednesday, contains essays by directors Steven Spielberg, Martin
Scorsese, film critic Pauline Kael and author Gore Vidal.
</P>
<P>
   THE GREATEST? Time's ($2.95) timing is as perfect as that of the
magazine's cover subject: Michael Jordan. Thanks to Jordan's
heroics, the Chicago Bulls won their sixth NBA title as Time was en
route to subscribers. Editor Daniel Okrent concedes that Jordan is
the greatest athlete in the United States, but picks Brazilian
soccer star Pele as the greatest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   BRIDAL PATH: In a special ``Love &AMP; Marriage'' issue, People
($3.95) reports on the most memorable celebrity weddings of the
year, from superheroes (Lucy Lawless and Rob Tapert, Kevin Sorbo
and Sam Jenkins) to superstars (Will Smith and Jada Pinkett, Sharon
Stone and Phil Bronstein). Among the trends People noted: pets,
medieval costumes and bubbles (instead of rice) were part of
wedding ceremonies; more wedding pictures are being shot in black
and white; and red meat is back. Both Lawless and Kelsey Grammer
opted for rack of lamb.

 &HT;    No sets or scripts: PBS shows the real life of a teenager
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know your kids, but you don't really know them.
</P>
<P>
   To get inside their skin, you could, like MTV's ``The Real
World,'' hoist a camera, plop them into a controlled environment
and monitor the heck out of them.
</P>
<P>
   Or better, like Atlanta filmmaker David Zeiger, you could enter
their world, their hangouts, parties, school, football games, band
practices and road trips, and do what so many parents just can't
seem to do with their kids: listen to them.
</P>
<P>
   Zeiger's school-year-long trek into the life of his then
16-year-old son Danny became a poignant 80-minute film he dubbed
``The Band,'' exploring the really real world of the teens who made
up the 1995-96 Decatur(Ga.) High School marching band. And now the
film has been trimmed to an hour for PBS' ``POV,'' which will air
it nationally (check local listings).
</P>
<P>
   These are great kids. They're funny (one kid's pickup line: ``Do
you believe in love at first sight ... or do I need to walk by you
again?''), wise and foolish, free-spirited, joyous and troubled _
their lives often rocked by divorce, unrequited love, race,
anorexia, Ritalin, Prozac, alcoholic family members and, sometimes,
death.
</P>
<P>
   Zeiger is here, he says, to deal with his family's own tragedy _
the death of Danny's 9-year-old brother Michael when Danny was 7.
Danny appeared withdrawn for nearly a decade until Zeiger noticed
his son smiling and dancing jubilantly with his fellow band members
at a football game.
</P>
<P>
   For Danny, ``time exploded when he was 7,'' Zeiger says. ``I was
never sure how well I knew him _ or him me. ... If I really want to
know Danny, I've got to know his world.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering that world leads to Chris (the kid always trying out
pickup lines on girls), Kate and Cameron (both diagnosed with
attention deficit disorder), Mary Ellen (struggling with anorexia)
and Burt (the perpetually in trouble, wise-cracking senior who
spouts, ``It's hard to be me and go to school'').
</P>
<P>
   The film's beautiful truth is the maturity with which these kids
take on life's problems and the honesty they express while facing
Zeiger's listening lens.
</P>
<P>
   One girl shares her burden of dealing with her mother's
drunkenness. ``I wet a cloth and put it over her eyes ... so that
she'll calm down,'' she says. ``I just lay down with her and put my
arms around her so she'll know someone is there.''
</P>
<P>
   We may want our kids to just be kids. But life doesn't work out
much like that anymore. It probably never really did. One look at
``The Band'' and you'll know a kid's life is as great _ and as hard
_ as anybody's.
</P>

   The Johnnie Walker Man
</P>
<P>
   The fact that fashion has become a tenet of pop culture has not
been lost on marketers. Increasingly, style has become an engine of
marketing for companies like Johnnie Walker, the liquor label. This
fall, Johnnie Walker will introduce a men's sportswear and
accessories collection, to be sold exclusively in Bloomingdale's
stores and its Christmas catalog.
</P>
<P>
   More than the usual promotional baseball cap and logo-emblazoned
jacket that liquor and tobacco companies favor, the line is being
designed by Jeffrey Banks. For four years ending in 1997, Banks was
the designer for the Bloomingdale's men's-wear label. The Johnnie
Walker collection signifies a re-emergence for Banks, who has kept
a low profile since blowing onto the fashion scene with his own
collection in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   This fall he will introduce his own signature men's sportswear
line, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who knows Banks' oeuvre _ understated, preppy _ will
already sense that the Johnnie Walker line won't boast boxer shorts
printed with liquor bottles. But the brand's recognizable logo, a
jaunty silhouette of a man in a top hat, will be evident on some
shirt hems and breast pockets. ``It's not on everything,'' Banks
said. ``I've tried to keep it dignified and discreet.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has made the prime target for its clothes the same
as for its Scotch, the upwardly mobile young man. ``This is the guy
two years ago who wore his baseball cap backwards, drank beer out
of a can and wore baggy jeans,'' Banks said. ``He now wears a
$1,000 suit and is working on Wall Street, he's smoking cigars,
drinking Cosmopolitans, and he wants to look as good on the
weekends as he does during the week.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Marvin Traub, the president of the marketing consultancy
Marvin Traub Associates and a senior adviser to Financo, an
investment company, who recommended that Johnnie Walker go into the
fashion business. The company had approached Traub, a former
chairman of Bloomingdale's, looking for a way to leverage its
brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I look at many of the global brands that are becoming
broader and broader in their range, they started with fashion,''
Traub said. ``You look at Ralph Lauren, who is the epitome, who's
now in paint.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnnie Walker clothing is to be introduced during the spring
1999 New York men's-wear shows, to be held from July 27 through 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Barneys Woman
</P>
<P>
   What's good enough for men, women want, too. Understanding this,
Barneys New York continues to expand its women's clothing to
include not just cutting-edge fashion but also the luxury classics
on which it built its renowned men's-wear business. Next month,
Barneys plans to introduce the feminine counterparts of three
high-end men's lines: Huntsman, a top Savile Row label, which
Barneys has sold for almost 20 years; Piatelli, an Italian luxury
collection, and Battistoni, also from Italy, which supplies Barneys
with ties and shirts, many made to order.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, these new women's lines are meant to replace the
traditional clothing that Barneys has offered under its signature
line, which is presently undergoing a face lift.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been moving more and more to fine tailoring and luxury
fabrics as customers have shown more of an interest in fine
tailoring,'' said Judy Collinson, an executive vice president of
Barneys. ``What this ultimately allows us to do is focus our own
collection on more fashion with more of a designer edge to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The women's lines will adhere to the spirit of their male
counterparts, with men's-wear fabrics and custom service _ and high
price. Jackets will range from $625 to $1,850; skirts and kilts,
$235 to $535, and trousers, $250 to $495. A corduroy coat from
Huntsman is $875, and a cashmere topper from Battistoni is $2,295.
</P>
<P>
   The lines will be on the sixth floor, near the reconstituted
store collection. The Barneys New York line is to reappear in July
as Barneys New York Collection: Taste, Luxury, Humor. Fans of the
store will be left to figure out just who among the colorful
executives at Barneys is Taste, who is Luxury and who is Humor.

COMING UP FROM THE STYLIST GHETTO  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMY M. SPINDLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH _ Miami is a sexy town, and Tony Melillo is the
hottest designer in residence, dressing South Beach tourists like
Leonardo DiCaprio and Barry Diller. So when he calls the Mix the
best-after hours club in the world, it's almost worth staying up
till 4:30 in the morning, when it opens. Almost.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Melillo was walking the five blocks from his apartment
to the club, the skies opened up, and everyone in the line outside
the door got soaked. Rain is a great equalizer, the perfect
accessory to wear to the Mix (Studio 54 if the velvet ropes had
been manned by Jerry Springer): rave kids with glow sticks, drag
queens, conventioneers discussing units sold, stoned surfers and
teen-age girls in side-slit miniskirts. It isn't exactly where, two
years after Melillo quit as fashion editor of elitist Esquire
magazine, anyone would expect to find him, cloaked in the privacy
of smoke, technobass and club-worthy clothes he designed.
</P>
<P>
   But Melillo, 33, has for a decade been one of fashion's most
conspicuous chameleons, adapting personas like trends: the English
aristocrat, the European playboy, the American gigolo. His latest
incarnation, hip designer, sends him into the Mix for inspiration,
wearing trousers he cut loose like jams and a muscle T-shirt with
the name of his company, Nova, emblazoned on the front.
</P>
<P>
   He's taking his new role seriously. On June 8, he left for
Korea, to work on production. On June 12, he was in Japan, to do
store appearances and television interviews. By June 22, he'll be
in New York to look at a possible boutique space on Elizabeth
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is fitted on me,'' he said. ``I do the whole
collection myself, take it out, wear it to a nightclub, then do my
corrections on it.''
</P>
<P>
   He's doing such a good job that when his store was broken into
soon after opening, the thieves stole clothes, not cash. Ron
Herman-Fred Segal in Los Angeles has sold more than 200 pairs of
his judo pants at $55 each.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Garduno, a vice president of that store, besides calling
Melillo the ``most charismatic person I've ever met,'' said he is
the first designer since the Prada and Gucci breakthroughs to go
after the casual sportswear market dominated for so long by generic
looks from the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response from the customer has been incredible, whether a
rock star or a regular person,'' Ms. Garduno said. ``They want
their own clothes, to look like themselves, and to create something
on their body. It's casual sportswear for the chicest people.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of doing what stylists and fashion editors do,
promoting and glorifying other people's creations, Melillo is
creating something himself. ``It's torture being a stylist,'' he
said. ``Especially when you're doing advertising. For a two-year
period, I went poor. I struggled. Clients didn't like me. They
said, `Tony came late, and left early, and sat in a room and didn't
talk to anybody.' And it was all true.''
</P>
<P>
   Top stylists and editors in fashion, years after making names
for themselves, have developed imprints even stronger than those of
many designers. Which is why a few have taken to charging $30,000
consultation fees for shows on top of their day rate, which
averages $3,000 to $5,000. That consultation can even include
choosing fabrics months before the runway shows, but the stylists
and editors never see the recognition designers get. Or the big
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why more stylists don't become designers,''
said Kelly Klein, Melillo's close friend. ``You'd think it would be
a natural extension of their career to do that. You can really see
their mark when the clothes walk down the runway.''
</P>
<P>
   Melillo has a theory about that. ``I grew up a simple person,''
he said. ``If I'm sitting there looking at the wall, and someone
says, `What are you thinking?' I'm thinking about the wall. People
think too much. They think of all the bad things that are going to
happen when they start the company. Maybe it means I'm a little
slow, but I feel fortunate. I'm a street person, with a street
mentality, hustle and jump. I'll jump before weighing it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Melillo carved out a life style familiar in an industry defined
by low pay but big expense accounts, geared to put stylish editors
at the right place at the right time, but not to let them make
enough to escape. Dressing celebrities for Esquire photo shoots, he
befriended a lot of people with opulent life styles, and quickly
learned to live the same way, on his expense account. ``The topper
was the bill for the dog's food at the Ritz in Paris,'' he said.
``It used to come on silver plates.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave up his apartment entirely, living between four-star
hotels. ``I stayed at the Four Seasons in Hollywood for a month to
photograph three people,'' he said. The photographer at the time
was Marc Hom, who said they were lying by the pool for a week
trying to find two more people to photograph. Suddenly, Melillo
grabbed the phone, saying, ``There's this great guy Chad McQueen.''
He got McQueen on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, ``It would be great to do this picture with you,'''
Hom recalled. ``And can you bring your father?''
</P>
<P>
   Esquire would have had to pay quite a bill if they had waited
for Steve McQueen to show up. ``That's Tony,'' Hom said. ``He's
completely into the idea, forgetting this person has been dead 25
years.''

<P>
   Melillo's playboy days always had a lot of self-parody about
them. When one wealthy woman friend lent him a 10-room apartment on
the Upper East Side rent-free, he pondered hiring a manservent with
the money he was saving. When rumors were flying through the
fashion industry that he was having an affair with a very rich and
very famous rock star, he said, ``I can't believe she's telling
people that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was having a dalliance with Farah Fawcett, and it was great
because at the time I wanted to interview her,'' recalled Christa
D'Souza, his wife and a writer for British Vogue, who ended up
interviewing Ms. Fawcett with Melillo and Ryan O'Neal in the room.
``I thought, how modern!'' she said. They're still married; Melillo
is the godfather of Flynn, the child Ms. D'Souza just had with
another man. Flynn's photos decorate Nova's walls.
</P>
<P>
   He once showed up wearing gold chains after spending the summer
on someone's yacht in St.-Tropez, France. ``He was so dark he
looked like a cowpat, or he'd put his head up a chimney,'' Ms.
D'Souza said. He's still tan, but now his style, as described by
Ms. Klein, is ``not into wearing too many clothes.'' When he does
wear something, he pulls his trousers so low that he had to design
Speedo-cut underwear for beneath.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to get out of Westchester, Pa., Melillo got his first
job at 19 at Williwear, with his main task being to get the staff
into clubs at night. ``He had an incredible aptitude for it,'' Ms.
D'Souza said. He met her there.
</P>
<P>
   They ended up married, and he decided to go to Milan, where he
sat for two months in the Conde Nast offices trying to get a job as
a fashion editor. His characteristic determination and optimism
paid off; they finally caved in and gave him one at the Italian
magazine Vanity. Terry McDonald later hired him for Smart magazine,
now defunct, where in 1989 he would dress so-called real people in
fashion, like intellectuals from Eastern-bloc countries, or
Milanese architects. McDonald then became editor of Esquire and
hired him there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had this idea he would design clothing, because he
was always messing with the ideas,'' said McDonald, who is now
editor of Men's Journal. He stressed that an interest in ideas, as
opposed to simply clothing, ``is dimly perceived in some circles.''
But not by Melillo's business partner, who is not a rich, famous
woman but a surfer from Miami, Gregory Frehling, 26, who started
Nova as a small women's label in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Melillo's idea was to use the Nova name and invent a men's line,
where the store was a scene. So when the guest house of Oribe's
former salon in Miami, a coral structure that's the oldest in the
city, was for rent, Melillo took it. He planted the garden himself,
made much of the furniture, and filled it with great clothes. And
now the local surfer kids come hang out all day long.

   BEIJING _ It was class time at Beijing University, but at 10
this morning seven guys in shorts and T-shirts crowded around a
large-screen color TV in dorm room 511, a spare cement cubicle
decorated with three metal bunk beds and yesterday's laundry. Nine
student ``shareholders'' had bought the TV last month in
anticipation of just such an occasion, and now hoots and jeers
filled the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aya, that Malone he plays dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice ball. Go Rodman!''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're losing with three minutes to go. I can't stand it. Hit
me with a hammer!''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, half a world away, the Chicago Bulls clinched
their sixth National Basketball Association championship with a
swish of the ball passing though basket with only five seconds to
play. The students jumped to their feet and began a refrain: ``Chou
Dan, Chou Dan, Chou Dan.''
</P>
<P>
   Chou Dan, of course, is Michael Jordan. Sure, Bill Clinton,
president of the world's most powerful nation, is about to visit
China. But to the Chinese, Michael Jordan remains America's king.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's state visit this month has brought out citizens'
interest in all things American, from books to clothes to movie
stars. But these all seem like passing fancies compared to the
intense passion that Chinese, especially young Chinese, have
developed for Michael Jordan and U.S. basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan is much more famous than Clinton here,'' said
Cheng Qian, 20, a Bulls fan and shareholder in the TV set who is a
management major at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have named him kongzhong feiren _ ``space flier.''
And, in the last week, businessmen, retired teachers, students and
government officials have all paused to watch him, live on
state-run television, as he led the Chicago Bulls to their 4-2
series victory over the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   When Beijing Meilande Information Co. recently asked 1,000 urban
Chinese to identify the best-known Americans ever, Michael Jordan
came in second, trailing Thomas Edison by just a few percentage
points. Behind him were Albert Einstein, Mark Twain and Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   On the sidewalks of Jianguomenwai Avenue, street vendors sell
Michael Jordan posters. In department stores, Michael Jordan books
and calendars sit beside those featuring Hong Kong movie stars and
Chairman Mao.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all American things, basketball is the most popular,'' said
Li Fa, a junior, who could not join the crowd in 511 because he is
a Jazz fan. ``Everyone knows Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   State television began broadcasting prerecorded NBA games in the
early 1990s, and recently switched to live broadcasts. On Monday,
Chinese viewers had three opportunities to see the final playoff
game, which the Bulls won 87-86. The first was live at 7:30 a.m.,
then there was a taped game at 9 a.m. for the late risers, and
finally a replay at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese are hard pressed to say why they so adore the Bulls and
Michael Jordan, who scored 45 points in the final game and was
named Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know _ because of his skill, and because he alone
carries half of the Chicago team,'' said Li Qixing, 20, another of
the TV's shareholders.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   U.S. basketball is certainly more colorful than the home-grown
variant, where the People's Liberation Army's August 1 team (named
for the day the army was founded) is the reigning champion. In
skill and in entertainment value, Chinese players are no match for
the likes of Dennis Rodman, who played the game with a green design
dyed in his hair.
</P>
<P>
   Said Han Bai, a junior, sitting on his bunk bed in jeans and a
T-shirt, ``I couldn't accept this from a Chinese player, but he's
an American, so we expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. sportscasts have other attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The students who forsook their studies to gather in room 511 on
this steamy summer morning, ooohed when they saw Leonardo DiCaprio,
star of the film ``Titanic,'' sitting at courtside. And, in a room
full of male college juniors, the Jazz's cheerleaders, dancing in
skintight black leotards, got the thumbs up as well. Heads nodded
in approval as Cheng Qian opined, ``In this way, the Jazz are
better than the Bulls.''

     LEGAL AID FUNDS FOR POOR IN DOUBT
AFTER HIGH COURT RULING
 &HT;     By CHRISTI HARLAN 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A program that helps pay for legal services for
poor people in 48 states will continue to have legal problems of
its own after the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 Monday that the money
being collected and disbursed does not belong to the states.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves a 17-year-old program that gathers the
interest earned on lawyers' trust accounts, which pool small
amounts of money that lawyers hold for their clients for short
periods. The amounts are too small to earn interest by themselves,
but the pooled accounts generate enough interest that states
distributed almost $100 million last year to groups that provide
legal aid to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``A significant setback to poor people's access to legal justice
was created'' with Monday's ruling, said Anne Harvey, litigation
administrator for the American Association of Retired Persons
Foundation. The foundation cited the need for legal assistance to
people having problems collecting Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled Monday that the interest that supports the
legal-aid groups belongs to lawyers' clients _ not the state _
despite the state's arguments that the interest wouldn't exist if
it weren't for the program that pools the clients' money, known as
Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts, or IOLTA. If the money were
placed in individual accounts, the state argued, bank fees would
eat up any interest that was earned.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who wrote the majority opinion,
agreed that individual accounts for lawyers' clients would not
generate any interest income, but he said the clients nevertheless
have a stake in the interest that is generated when their money is
pooled.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the interest income at issue here may have no
economically realizable value to its owner,'' Rehnquist wrote,
``possession, control and disposition are nonetheless valuable
rights that inhere in the property.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice David Souter, who wrote one of two dissenting opinions,
said the court created ``an essentially abstract proposition'' by
finding that clients ``own'' interest that wouldn't exist without
the state program.
</P>
<P>
   The majority ruled ``that the interest income generated by funds
held in IOLTA accounts is the `private property' of the owner of
the principal,'' Rehnquist said in his opinion. ``We express no
view as to whether these funds have been `taken' by the State; nor
do we express an opinion as to the amount of `just compensation,'
if any,'' that is due to the clients.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist was quoting from part of the 5th Amendment to the
Constitution, which says, ``nor shall private property be taken for
public use without just compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court said lower courts will have to decide whether
the interest gathered from clients' money violates the 5th
Amendment. That will spark a new round of litigation in the federal
appeals court in New Orleans and, possibly, before U.S. District
Judge James Nowlin of Austin, Texas, in whose court the case began.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Samp, chief counsel for the Washington Legal Foundation,
which challenged Texas's program, said the group will continue its
efforts to stop the programs in all states that have them. The
foundation objects to some of the uses of the money generated from
the lawyers' accounts, such as litigation to enforce the Voting
Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are 90 percent of the way home ... now that it's determined
that there's a property right,'' Samp said.
</P>
<P>
   Until the next round of court battles is over, lawyers for
Texas' legal aid program said it will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's business as usual for us at the foundation,'' said
Richard Royds, a Houston lawyer who chairs the Texas Equal Access
to Justice Foundation, which distributes the money collected from
Texas lawyers' trust accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't lose necessarily by their having found a
property-right interest,'' Dallas lawyer Darrell Jordan said of the
five justices who formed the Supreme Court majority. ``We regard
this as a very narrow ruling that leaves IOLTA intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan presented the case for Texas' legal aid program in
arguments before the Supreme Court in January. Jordan represents
the Texas Supreme Court, which made the interest-collection program
mandatory for Texas lawyers in 1989. The program, which got its
start in Florida in 1981, was voluntary for Texas lawyers beginning
in 1984.

   BOSNIA-NATO (Skopje, Macedonia) _ With conflict in separatist
Kosovo Province intensifying, and diplomats fear, likely to spread
to other Balkan countries, the West has threatened the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic, with air strikes unless he stops the
stop using military force against civilians and enters serious

ruled Monday that the interest earned from short-term trust

was thrown out of his own job as chief executive of the Sunbeam

PVC FENCING STILL LACKS A TRACK RECORD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I like the idea of PVC fencing. But doesn't it crack in very
cold weather?
</P>
<P>
   MARY DOWD, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. PVC (vinyl) fencing is new, so it has no track record,
although I am sure it has been adequately tested. I don't think it
will crack, since it is more stable than wood and resists excessive
expansion and contraction with the weather. It is put together
loosely to allow for such movement, just as vinyl siding is loosely
nailed to allow for it. But we won't know for sure until the fence
goes through several seasons.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. A refrigerator given to me has a bit of glue on the door gasket,
and this makes the door hard to open. How can I get rid of the glue
and allow the door to open and close more easily.
</P>
<P>
   FRANK CAPRARELLA, Boston &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If alcohol or DeSolvit do not work, then try ordinary oil
such as corn oil or any other cooking oil. Apply this to the glue,
leave it for an hour, then wipe it off with a rough cloth. Or, take
a dull knife and carefully run it down the gasket. I think it is
important to remove the glue because it may be making the gasket
thicker than normal, interfering with the opening and closing.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, covering the glue with a piece of duct tape
or other thin tape to keep the glue away from the door is not
likely to work.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The kitchen linoleum in some rental property I own has worn
out. What has the greatest longevity: sheet vinyl or linoleum tile?
Or something else? I also have to have the brick house repointed,
at a cost of $5,000-$15,000. That is not too bad, because I know it
is a lot of work; but how can I get a good mason?
</P>
<P>
   B.Q., Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. For longevity (virtually forever), use glazed ceramic tile.
Things will break when dropped on it, but the tile can be cleaned
by a swish with a wet cloth. Sheet vinyl generally is more durable
than vinyl tiles. Getting a good mason is a matter of luck. Check
the Yellow Pages, then find out from the Better Business Bureau if
any complaints have been filed against the mason you may hire. If
you know anyone who has hired a mason, ask him how he likes the
job. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. My kitchen cabinets are still in good shape, but they are badly
stained by cigarette smoke. Is there a sure-fire way to get rid of
the stains? I have tried a lot of things without success. FRANK
ALBRIS, Winter Haven, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You didn't mention what you have already tried, but here's
what I'd do:
</P>
<P>
   Make a strong solution of Spic and Span and water, and apply
this to the cabinets. Let it sit on the cabinets for two or three
minutes or even more, keeping it wet; this will allow the Spic and
Span to dissolve the stains so you can clean them off.
</P>
<P>
   Or, Simple Green, again letting it sit on the finish for a few
minutes before scrubbing with a sponge and rinsing off.
</P>
<P>
   Or, this solution: 1 cup ammonia, 1/2 cup white vinegar, 1/4 cup
baking soda, in 1 gallon warm water. As with any cleaner, letting
it sit on the finish for several minutes is more likely to make it
work than trying to swish it on and off.
</P>

   Another possibility: Soil &AMP; Soot remover, a sponge that uses no
water. It is manufactured in Worcester and is available for $2.99
at some hardware stores. When the sponge gets dirty, wash with soap
and water for reuse. Let dry before reusing. My good friend Jerry
Morris of Orange discovered this and told me about it. He found it
in a store on Cape Cod, but that is a long drive from Winter Haven!

ONLY PATH TO LEAKY PIPE IS THROUGH WALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Resending, deleting garbled first Q and A; moved June 12)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have a leak in a water pipe in a wall. It is sporadic, but
the pipe is, I believe, fairly small. The plumber said he would
have to open the wall to get to the pipe in order to fix it. Is
there any other way?
</P>
<P>
   WYNN GERHARD, Plymouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Not really, because you have to determine what kind of a pipe
it is: water supply (small pipe) and, usually, a steady leak, or a
drain pipe (two or three inches in diamater) and a sporadic leak
because water is in the pipe only when a sink, shower, tub, or
toilet is drained.
</P>
<P>
   If you know where the pipe is, a small part of the wall can be
removed to allow inspection and to locate the leak. Then enough
wall is removed to get to the leak and fix it.
</P>
<P>
   While this is a pain, it is not so difficult to patch a wall. If
the hole or holes are relatively small, you can close them up by
building up layers of joint compound until the hole is closed.
Smooth off, sand smooth, and repaint.
</P>
<P>
   If the hole is large, make it bigger, enough to expose two
studs, being careful to expose half the stud. Cut a plasterboard
patch to insert, nail, or screw it to those exposed studs, and fill
the joints with compound, paper tape, and more compound for an
invisible patch.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am trying to make a ``grave frame'' a frame to hold a
picture for lying on a grave. For the base, I mixed concrete and
poured it in a form. When it cured it, it came out full of holes.
Then I tried using a plug-type concrete (hydraulic) with the same
results. How can I get nice, smooth concrete without holes?
</P>
<P>
   JUDITH MAYER, Halifax, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Make the mix thinner in consistency by adding a bit of water
to it, but not too much because too thin a mix will weaken the
concrete. And, after you pour the thinner concrete in the form (and
it should pour a little, not requiring plopping in vast gobs of
it), puddle the mixture; that is, stick a trowel in the mix several
times, vigorously; this will shake down the concrete so it fills
the form completely, filling any voids that caused previous holes.
And, make sure the stones in the mix are as small as practical.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The wheels of my fertilize spreader no longer move. How can I
get them to go again?
</P>
<P>
   ELIZABETH BERNDT, Woburn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Synthetic fertilizer contains chemicals such as nitrates and
potash, all corroding the metal, freezing up the wheels. Spray WD40
or other dry lubricant on the wheels where they meet the axle. If
that doesn't help, take the wheels off and clean the axle and the
wheel holes with emory cloth. If the corrosion is thick, scrape it
off first, then sand, then lubricate before putting the wheels back
on. If this fails, you will need a new spreader.

 &HT;    Marlins-Braves rematch set for The Ted
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An hour after the Florida Marlins eliminated the
Atlanta Braves from the NLCS last Oct. 14, a group of men, some
still in jackets and tie, sneaked onto the playing surface at
Turner Field and took a jog around the bases before posing for a
photo around home plate.
</P>
<P>
   No mere trespassers, the group included Marlins owner H. Wayne
Huizenga, team president Don Smiley and some of the suits who
operated the team that later would become World Champions. Their
cigars glowed in the midnight darkness and, their victory lap
completed, the group laughed while the photographer's flashes
illuminated the infield.
</P>
<P>
   The same team returns to The Ted for the first time tonight, and
it will hardly be a photo op. The reigning champion Marlins, with
the worst record in the major leagues at 21-47, come back to
Atlanta, not much better off than old man Santiago, who beached his
great fish carcass at the end of ``The Old Man and the Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard the jokes,'' Marlins manager Jim Leyland said over
the weekend, when Florida accomplished a four-game split with the
New York Mets. `` 'The Mets are down at Semi-Pro Players Stadium.'
Everybody wants to be a comedian.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be funny, if it wasn't pitiful. Since Huizenga ordered
the club's downsizing last November to make it more affordable to
sell, the Marlins are indistinguishable from 1997. Only eight
players from the postseason roster _ nine, counting the recovering
Alex Fernandez _ remain on the team. Since Opening Day, some $20.6
million has been pared from the roster, with the dealing away of
Gary Sheffield and Bobby Bonilla, among others.
</P>
<P>
   In their place is a peach-fuzzed roster that could lose 110
games, a 29-year high in the National League and 12 more defeats
than the franchise withstood in its inaugural season. In all, 23
rookies have appeared in Florida uniform already this year, and the
current 25-man roster includes 14 of them, including eight of 12
pitchers. Of the three starters the Braves will face in this
series, Joe Fontenot spent all of last year at Class AA Shreveport,
Jesus Sanchez was at Class AA Binghampton, and Ryan Dempster,
Thursday's pitcher, was at Class A Brevard County.
</P>
<P>
   Until a group put together by Smiley can settle its finances _
Smiley is said to have secured $140 million to 145 million of
Huizenga's $169 million price _ the on-field exploitation of the
Marlins continues. And nobody is enjoying it.
</P>
<P>
   In what was to have been a meeting between the 1996 and 1997
champions, the New York Yankees recently swept three from Florida,
prompting the Yankees' Joe Torre to say: ``You've won the World
Series. Great. Hurray. But if you only did it for yourself, then
it's not right. That's not the right thing to do.''

<P>
   Jordan in cat-bird seat where Bulls decisions are concerned
</P>
<P>
   By Curtis Bunn
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY, Utah _ Even in the euphoric aftermath of a sixth
NBA championship in eight years, Michael Jordan held on to the
uneasy tension that has engulfed the Chicago Bulls all season.
After embracing teammates and playing to a Delta Center crowd that,
even in its disappointment, had to admire the game's best player,
Jordan came upon owner Jerry Reinsdorf. In Chicago, that's viewed
as good vs. evil.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan gave Reinsdorf a sideways smile. Reinsdorf offered Jordan
a celebratory cigar by holding it up. Jordan accepted the stogie
and climbed atop the makeshift platform that rested on the court,
placing him above everyone else, where he belonged. But he did not
pause, did not hug his employer, and neither said a word.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan wants to make one more championship run, a true
Last Dance, with the key personnel _ coach Phil Jackson, Scottie
Pippen and, to a lesser degree, Dennis Rodman _ in place. Reinsdorf
and general manager Jerry Krause are the key impediments to those
desires. So the jubilant Jordan did not make nice with the owner,
even in what had to be one of the most glorious moments of his
sparkling career.
</P>
<P>
   Until Jordan gets what he wants _ and he almost always does,
doesn't he? _ his relationship with Bulls management will be
strained at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only hope and pray that Michael and Scottie will come
back and defend the championship one more time,'' Reinsdorf said
Sunday night after Jordan spun a 45-point performance that included
the game- and series-winning jump shot with 5.2 seconds remaining
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   That was Reinsdorf at his spin-doctoring best. Public opinion of
him and Krause, who was called a ``mad gerbil'' by a Chicago Sun
Times columnist, dipped below sea level with the news that they
intended to dismantle the club after this season.
</P>
<P>
   Since then it's been one power play after another: Krause
telling Jackson he would not be back after this season; Pippen
saying he'd never wear a Bulls uniform again; Jordan saying he
would not play for another coach or without Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, Jordan pulled the power play of all power
plays, lifting Chicago to a 4-2 Finals victory over Utah with a
pulsating 87-86 Game 6 victory Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Jazz prevented the Bulls' repeat of the three-peat,
then, perhaps, Reinsdorf had grounds to make changes. But Jordan
carried the Bulls to the summit, and who is to say that next year,
at 36, he could not do it again with Jackson on the bench and
Pippen by his side?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're seeing Michael at the top of his game,'' Pippen said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   So why would he quit now? His close friends say he wants a
nostalgic farewell tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still a lot of unanswered questions,'' Jordan said.
``There are a lot of sympathetic feelings about this team and where
we want it to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan wants to go on, but not without Pippen, who softened on
his ``I'm outta here'' position of last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player right now, I don't feel like it's over,'' Pippen
said about the Bulls' run. ``You never know. Anything's possible.
You hate to see it come to an end. We feel like we're dominant,
even though we weren't 100 percent healthy. It's been a lot of
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fun?'' That's not a word Pippen had used in relation to this
season's Bulls. So his use of that word might indicate that
Jordan's will already is working. If Pippen is going to walk from
Chicago into the unknown free-agent world, he'll do so resisting
almost certain prodding from Jordan to stay.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jackson, he has admitted to already cleaning out his
office at the United Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless something absolutely unusual comes out of left field,''
he said, ``I don't expect to see us back here again.''
</P>
<P>
   He should have spoken for himself. Jordan has backed away from
his early-season statement about playing only for Jackson. He
sounds now like the loss of his coach could be offset if Pippen
stays. In fact, Jordan even addressed the notion of playing next
season without either of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pretty big challenge,'' he said about that possibility,
``but the question is: Do I want to do that or not? That's the
thing that has to be debated.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time gets involved, some of the feelings may change. You
never know. But that's the purpose of waiting until the end of the
summer and making final decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen has been insulted by the team's refusal to grant him a
new deal, leaving him as the 122nd-highest-paid player in the
league. A three-year, $45-million contract would be a nice start
toward easing Pippen's uneasy feelings about Reinsdorf and Krause.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is not so much concerned about his salary as he is about
his teammates. He joins eight Chicago players who will become free
agents on July 1. Only Toni Kukoc, Ron Harper and Randy Brown are
under contract for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Longley may have cost himself a spot on the 1999 roster
after going scoreless in a poor title game. Steve Kerr, Bill
Wennington and Scott Burrell also might be gone.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman's case is different from the rest. His return is
contingent on Jordan and Pippen returning, and on them saying they
could put up with his silly antics. ``I definitely want to come
back,'' Rodman said. ``If they want me back.''
</P>
<P>
   If they don't think that ``Rodzilla'' is worth the aggravation,
a free agent like Charles Barkley could come calling. For $1
million, Barkley would leap at the opportunity to play with Jordan
and Pippen. But they would decide.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions aren't expected soon. Jordan sets a timeline at the
end of the summer. He knows the longer Pippen waits, the more he'll
hear from Chicago fans to make one more run. It will bring
tremendous pressure.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Jordan knows Reinsdorf will get more mail and
more heat to make Pippen feel welcome.
</P>
<P>
   And if all Jordan's maneuvering fails, he'll walk away. For
good, and with no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have another life,'' he said. ``I know I have to get to it
at some point in time. Hopefully, the fans and people will
understand that.''

 &HT;    NBA players, front offices have long off-season ahead
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the wings of a contentious Finals, a bravura performance by
the game's greatest player and perhaps the largest TV audience in
the history of the playoffs, the NBA should be at its zenith today
in popularity and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But dwarfed by the question of the Chicago Bulls' future is the
matter of the NBA's existence as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks, the league almost certainly will lock its doors
and cease to do business while it haggles with the players union
over a division of profits.
</P>
<P>
   Before Michael Jordan can decide whether to play again or
Scottie Pippen can choose his uniform for 1998-99 or the Utah Jazz
can fine tune their veteran squad for another run, disagreement
over dispersal of dollars will strangle the NBA this summer and,
perhaps, into the new season.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent press conference, NBA Commissioner David Stern
appeared to invite a work stoppage as an alternative to escalating
salaries. The only major sports league in the U.S. that has never
lost a regular season game to labor trouble now says that is no
longer the governing issue.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the players have taken the curious step of
threatening to boycott the world championships this summer,
although most owners couldn't care less.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are returning to the summer of 1995, when rookie and
free-agent signings were halted, and both sides tried not to come
off as spoiled brats.
</P>
<P>
   That might be tougher this time around, as the players demand a
bigger slice of the pie and question Stern's contention that 57
percent of the gross goes to the players and that as many as eight
teams actually need subsidies to remain healthy. It's all
bookkeeping, the players say.
</P>
<P>
   They want to make certain their wealthiest members do not have
restrictions placed on their ability to earn even more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the owners have their way, Michael and Scottie will only
make $5 million next year,'' said Hawks center Dikembe Mutombo,
vice president of the players union.
</P>
<P>
   That issue might not sit well with the public. The rank and file
of the players association might crumple as questions about their
own self-interests are raised. After all, what good does it do a
Tyrone Corbin that teammates Steve Smith and Mutombo have $50
million-plus deals, when that wealth forces Corbin and others to
take minimum money.
</P>
<P>
   And while all of that is ironed out, no rookie and no free agent
will be signed, no player traded. Teams will schedule camps for
second-round picks and undrafted players at month's end, but no
player can be signed before July 1, and a lockout appears certain
on that date.
</P>
<P>
   What does it mean to the fan? All the blustering about Jordan,
the Jazz and next week's annual draft means nothing until the end
of September, when training camps are scheduled to open. If they
don't, there is cause for some concern.
</P>
<P>
   If all of October's preseason is lost, opening night on the
first weekend of November is seriously jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two real dates to remember: Nov. 15, when players
normally receive their first pay checks since the previous spring,
and Dec. 25, the date of the first telecast on NBC, the league's
major cash cow.

   _ Quickly: The Marlins just split a four-game weekend series
with the second-place New York Mets and have gone 4-3 since coming
out of a 11-game losing streak on June 8. They are in the midst of
a difficult stretch of the schedule, with 13 games against the
Braves, Mets and New York Yankees in a 17-day period. . . . At
5-24, Florida is the worst road team in the majors. Even expansion
Arizona has won 10 road games. The Marlins hit .233 away from Pro
Player Stadium. . . . The Marlins can start fast and finish strong.
The team has outscored opponents 72-43 in the first inning, and
during the last 25 2/3 innings (0.70 ERA), the bullpen has allowed
16 hits and two solo homers. . . . Edgar Renteria's 20 steals are
4th in the NL. Overall, Florida ranks in the bottom quarter of the
league in nine offensive categories. The team ERA of 5.31 is
highest in the NL. . . . Fotenot, tonight's starter, originally was
San Francisco's first-round pick of the 1995 draft; he went to
Florida in the Robb Nen deal. He is making his fifth major-league
start and is allowing a .405 average against left-handers. . . . On
the DL: INF Kevin Millar (broken right hand), RHP Alex Fernandez
(rotator cuff surgery), RHP Eric Ludwick (broken right forearm),
RHP Rafael Medina (sore right shoulder).
</P>
<P>
   _ Who's hot: Renteria is on a seven-game hit streak, batting
.464 during the Marlins' seven-game homestand. 3B Todd Zeile hit
.387 during the same period with three doubles and seven RBI in 26
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   _ Who's not: C Greg Zaun is hitting 3-for-34 (.088) this month
with nine strikeouts. Rookie 1B Derek Lee is batting .204,
including .157 in 51 at-bats against left-handers.

   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ Madelyn Carabello spent a recent Thursday
afternoon at the Tropicana Casino, locked in a hypnotic trance as
she dropped coins in a slot machine and watched the reels spin.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a security guard asked for identification. If her
flawlessly youthful face, striped denim jeans and tennis shoes were
not enough to tip the casino's security staff that it had an
under-age gambler in its midst, then surely the gold pendant around
her neck was a dead giveaway. It was a large heart, surrounding the
numeral 19, her age.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't ask me anything until I had been playing for over
an hour and a half,'' Ms. Carabello said, nervously fingering the
pendant. She was told to cash in her chips (she won about $30, she
said) and was escorted out of the gambling area.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 feet from the carpeted casino floor, Ms. Carabello, a
freshman at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City,
waited for friends who were still gambling. She recalled the fiscal
promiscuity that had overcome her on the night of her senior prom
last year in Miami, when she and about 10 classmates left to board
a gambling boat that sailed from southern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard that you only had to be 18'' to gamble on the boat,
she said. ``I had heard how it was in a casino, that you could win
money and stuff. I was like, `OK, let's do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carabello said she had lost money on her prom night but was
bitten by the gambling bug. ``I like it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Like a first kiss, getting the car keys for the first time or
walking into a bar and buying a drink, gambling has become a rite
of passage for young people on their way to adulthood. With casinos
in 26 states and lotteries in 38, young people have watched their
parents choose from a hefty menu of legalized gambling activities
and now they are going on dates, spending their prom nghts and
joining college classmates at the nearest casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that young people said, `I'm 21, let's go have a
drink,''' said psychology professor Howard Shaffer of Harvard
University. ``Now they say, `I'm 21, let's go gamble.'''
</P>
<P>
   But along with this change in the American cultural scene comes
a growing concern from experts on compulsive gambling about the
number of youths who gamble at an early age, and gamble
excessively. Like other social activities that mark adolescence,
gambling has its pitfalls. A study conducted last year by Louisiana
State University found that one in seven Louisianians 18 to 21 were
problem gamblers, youths with a chronic and progressive
psychological disorder characterized by an emotional dependence on
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer recently conducted an analysis of nationwide studies of
gambling addiction in which he found that the rate of problem
gambling among adolescents was 9.4 percent, more than twice the 3.8
percent rate for adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people have been gambling since the beginning of time,''
he said. ``But I think now, for the first time, young people are
growing up having lived their entire lives in a social environment
where gambling is promoted and socially accepted.''
</P>

<P>
   Children find lessons in wagering all around them, from the
sports trading cards that they buy hoping for one with a large
monetary payoff to advertising by Nabisco during Saturday-morning
cartoons, offering $1,000 to the lucky child who buys a package of
Chips a'hoy cookies with the chocolate chips missing. The
fundamental principal of gambling _ buying a chance to win more
money _ is indeed more prevalent in the lives of young people than
it has ever been.
</P>
<P>
   The states sponsoring lotteries, as well as the casino industry
and other businesses, do their part, whether intentional or not, to
enhance gambling's appeal to the young. Lottery scratch cards have
bright, cartoonish graphics. Video poker machines resemble the
video machines that a generation of children have grown up playing.
</P>
<P>
   Video arcades for children along the Boardwalk in Atlantic City
include reconditioned slot machines that work just like the real
thing but offer prizes instead of money. And the casino industry,
by surrounding itself with amusement parks and attractions that
appeal to the young, has given parents a reason to bring children
along when they visit places like Atlantic City and Las Vegas
_introducing adolescents to casinos, and cultivating future
gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Market-savvy managers are grooming the next generation,'' said
Marvin Roffman, a Philadelphia-based gambling analyst. ``The kids
go to the amusement park for the day, and when the family gets back
to the hotel room, Dad is talking about how he did at the blackjack
tables, and Mom is talking about how she did at the slots. The kids
are listening, and it's making an impression on them.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many other things to worry about, like teen-age
pregnancy, drug abuse and drunken driving, many parents and
educators say they have not yet focused on gambling as one of their
major concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The casino industry, keenly aware of the potential for
compulsive gambling to become the bane that nicotine addiction is
to the tobacco industry _ and aware that a presidential commission
will soon issue a comprehensive report on the impact of gambling on
the country _ has recently begun to acknowledge the problem and
take pre-emptive steps. New programs to discourage under-age
gambling are being paid for and implemented by the industry, and
studies on compulsive gambling, particularly among under-age
gamblers, are being conducted through research grants from the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the under-age gaming going on in this country is not
going on inside the casinos,'' said Frank Fahrenkopf, president of
the American Gaming Association, the casino industry's lobbying
organization. He pointed out that many young people gamble on
sports and play lotteries. ``We are trying to reach out to that
area of the population.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   It is true that like other rites of passage, gambling will prove
harmless in the long term for most of the young people who try it.
Shaffer said that many teen-agers experimented with gambling and
lost interest as they became adults. One primary reason that
teen-agers are so interested in gambling, he said, is that adults
have failed to inform them of the dangers. ``I think it's because
of the whole social milieu that we've provided these young
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While much is left to be learned about the long-term impact of
gambling's pervasiveness, it is already quite clear that some
youths are destined to have problems with their gambling. Gambling
experts estimate that 10 to 15 percent of youths who gamble become
``problem gamblers,'' meaning they suffer some loss of control over
their gambling behavior. And according to the Council on Compulsive
Gambling of New Jersey, of those who experience more severe
problems and become pathological gamblers, most are people who
start gambling before they reach 14.
</P>
<P>
   One such case is that of Malcolm, a 17-year-old youth from
Plainfield, N.J., who at 13 was playing craps in his neighborhood
and wagering on pick-up basketball games and ``see-low,'' a game
played with three dice that is popular among teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always gambled, so I thought that I may have a problem,''
Malcolm said. After a recent conviction for marijuana possession,
Malcolm was sent to New Hope Foundation, an in-patient addiction
center in Marlboro, N.J. Compulsive gambling was diagnosed, and now
he receives treatment for both drug and gambling problems. Like
other addicts in recovery progams, Malcolm agreed to be identified
only by his first name.
</P>
<P>
   Cole DiMattio, one of Malcolm's counselors at the center, said
that it was Malcolm's interest in gambling that led him to drugs.
``All of his gambling,'' DiMattio said, ``looking for that crowd,
brought him into the drug culture.'' When he was a child, Malcolm
said in a recent telephone interview, his parents often played the
state lottery and visited the casinos in Atlantic City. ``They
didn't take me with them'' he said. ``But I wanted to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all young problem gamblers are able to withstand the
travails wrought by their excessive wagering. Last November, just
after running up a $6,000 debt betting on the World Series, Moshe
Pergament, a 19-year-old college student from an affluent Long
Island family, decided to end his gambling, and his life. He bought
a toy handgun and drove erratically on the Long Island Expressway,
causing police officers to stop him. When he was pulled over, he
aimed the gun at the officers, who responded by shooting and
killing him. The police said they found letters in Pergament's car
that revealed the gambling debt and his intention of having police
shoot him, a phenomenon known as ``suicide by cop.''
</P>
<P>
   Many experts said that the best method for dealing with the
escalating interest in gambling among youths is to teach them more
about the potential downside to gambling, and to get them to
understand the extent to which the odds are against them. Still,
said Edward Looney, the executive director of the Council on
Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey, ``Youngsters are youngsters, and
gambling is an exciting thing for them to do because it's risky.''
</P>
<P>
   At Atlantic City High School here, students said that betting on
sports and playing card games for money was common. Several
students said in interviews that they knew of a fellow student who
worked as a professional bookie, laying odds on games and
collecting bets. ``The guy books bets right in school,'' said Tom
Le, 16, a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   In May, on the night of the school's senior prom, one of the
activities arranged for the evening was a mock casino, set up
inside the cafeteria. Students received chips and played casino
games like blackjack and craps. ``I was really astonished at how
well they knew the games,'' said Steele, the principal. He said he
believed that gambling had captured the fancy of young people
because it made them feel like adults. ``I guess it's a nice
feeling to go into the casino, play and receive complimentary
drinks,'' he said. ``How can you tell them, here it is, it's
exciting, but you can't do it? We have to face it, it's here to
stay. It's a matter that's going to have to be dealt with. I don't
know how. Just hope and pray that it's done on a small scale.''
</P>
<P>
   In parts of the country where gambling has grown especially
fast, the problem with underage gambling is particularly acute.
Louisiana has long had horse racing and back-room card games, but
in the last decade it has added riverboat casinos, video poker
machines, a state lottery and casinos operated by Native Americans,
Officials were jolted into action after the Louisiana State
University study found that youths there were three times as likely
as adults to become problem gamblers. The study, conducted by the
department of psychiatry, surveyed 12,066 adolescents in grades six
through twelve in public and private schools in the 1996-97 school
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature this year raised to 21 from 18 the minimum age
for playing the state lottery and video poker machines at more than
5,000 bars, restaurants and truck stops. Most states require
lottery players to be at least 18. About half the states with
casinos or video poker and slot machines allow 18-year-olds to
play, while the other half, including Nevada and New Jersey,
require those gamblers to be at least 21. The majority of states
with parimutuel betting on events like horse racing, dog racing and
jai alai allow 18-year-olds to bet.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana recently, after a local television reporter used an
undercover camera to show that underage gamblers were easily
boarding the more than a dozen casino riverboats docked around the
state, state gambling regulators are now threatening to rescind the
licenses of casino operators who cannot keep under-age gamblers off
their boats. In other states with legalized gambling, there are
similar concerns. A citizen watchdog group in Illinois, for
example, recently filmed under-age students drinking and gambling
on the state's riverboats. The state gaming board then took steps
to enforce age minimums.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is under-age gambling is a little like
under-age drinking,'' said John Kennedy, Louisiana's secretary of
revenue and a member of the state gaming control board. ``Minors,
by definition, don't have the reasoning power of adults. If you
don't have the reasoning power than you can't know your limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many teen-agers simply do not want to wait until they are
old enough to gamble. In Atlantic City last year, 38,502 juveniles
were escorted out of the city's 12 casinos, according to the
state's casino control commission. An additional 52,364 under-age
would-be gamblers tried to enter a casino and were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   The interest that children develop in gambling often starts long
before they are old enough to sneak into a casino. A group of Long
Island parents, concerned that their young children were hooked on
sports trading cards, filed lawsuits against six of the major
sports trading card companies in 1996, claiming that the companies
have colluded to conduct an illegal gambling enterprise by
inserting rare and valuable cards that could instantly be redeemed
for cash. The lawsuits, filed in New York, New Jersey, Texas and
California, are pending, although one claim in Texas was dismissed
by the court there.
</P>
<P>
   James Schaefer, an anthropologist at Union College in
Schenectady, N.Y., who conducted research for the plaintiffs,
visited card shops and sports memorabilia shows where the cards are
bought and traded. What he found was that children as young as 6
were doing what is known as ``insert card chasing'' _ spending $2
to $6 for a pack of cards, ripping them open, quickly flipping
through them in search of the valuable inserts, discarding the
``garbage cards'' and buying more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are driven to find a valuable insert card, and
they'll spend all the money they have to find it,'' Schaefer said.
</P>
<P>
   Many teen-agers in places like Atlantic City become familiar
with casino games because they work after school or in summer at
the casinos. Although customers must be 21, the minimum age for
working at a casino is 18. However, gambling experts said that many
of those who gamble at school or elsewhere come from affluent
families and have more money than the average student. Casinos here
and in other cities have created opportunities for young people.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to jobs, casinos provide a wide range of assistance
to local teen-agers, from scholarships to mentoring programs. But
with some of those same young people becoming increasingly
fascinated with gambling, some communities are now questioning
whether they should accept any largess from the casinos in their
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, casino employees participate in career days at
high schools, and casinos have donated just about everything to
students, from pumpkins for Halloween to playing cards emblazoned
with casino logos. But now, after opponents of gambling complained
that these donations were were only veiled attempts by the casinos
to cultivate future loyal customers, gambling regulators are
considering a ban on donations from casinos to students. ``We are
trying to make a determination as to whether the stuff they do in
the schools is marketing,'' said Hillary Crain, chairman of the
state's gaming control board.

COURT RULING COULD JEOPARDIZE FUNDING OF LEGAL SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A sharply divided Supreme Court decision on Monday
cast constitutional doubt on state programs generating $100 million
a year for legal services for poor people by pooling the interest
on some of the money clients deposit for brief periods with their
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   That interest is actually the property of the clients, the court
ruled in a 5-4 decision that raised, but did not answer, the
further and more salient question of whether channeling the money
for legal services amounts to an unconstitutional ``taking'' of
private property for a public purpose.
</P>
<P>
   That question will now be answered by the lower federal courts,
and eventually by the Supreme Court as the case works it way back
up through the legal system. Reaction Monday was sharply split over
whether the court's handling of the initial property question
foreshadowed an eventual ruling that the program is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The case, a challenge brought to the program in Texas by
property rights advocates, represented the leading edge of a debate
that has taken place largely out of the public eye but that has
galvanized the organized bar. In many respects, it is the latest
chapter in the long-running, ideologically charged battle over the
fate of publicly funded legal services programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Justices themselves split along ideological lines. Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion, which was
joined by his four most conservative colleagues: Justices Antonin
Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M.
Kennedy. Justices David H. Souter, John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer dissented.
</P>
<P>
   In declaring the interest to be clients' property, the court
rejected arguments put forward by the chief justices of all 50
states, the American Bar Association, 35 state attorneys general,
and numerous government groups. These groups argued that properly
understood, the interest should not be seen as the clients'
property because it would be nonexistent, eaten up by transaction
costs, except for the pooling arrangement that courts and
legislatures in all 50 states have adopted under a program known as
Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts.
</P>
<P>
   According to a brief filed by the American Bar Association,
money generated by the programs is second only to the federal
government as a source of funding for legal services, accounting
for as much as a quarter of the legal services budgets. In
addition, Congress has been cutting the budget of the Legal
Services Corp. and placing restrictions on the types of cases that
lawyers who work for the federally funded programs can bring.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the program, usually referred to by its initials as
IOLTA, began in Australia in the 1960s. Its adoption in the United
States came only in 1980, when Congress authorized banks to pay
interest on checking accounts for certain types of depositors.
Before then, lawyers typically deposited short-term client funds,
such as escrow or settlement deposits, in non-interest bearing
accounts, so the question of what to do with the interest did not
arise.
</P>
<P>
   Once interest-bearing checking accounts became available, the
American Bar Association and other lawyers' groups were quick to
promote adoption of the Australian idea of directing the pooled
interest to legal services. They reasoned that for clients, the
interest was largely theoretical in any event, because the costs of
opening an account and dealing with tax forms would quickly cancel
out the earnings from all but sizeable deposits. When actual net
interest to a client was a possibility, that client's deposit would
not be pooled, but would go into a separate, individual account for
the client's benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Supreme Court adopted an IOLTA program for the state
in 1984. All states now have such a program.
</P>
<P>
   The case against the Texas program that the Supreme Court ruled
on was brought by a conservative public interest law firm, the
Washington Legal Foundation. It challenged the program both as an
unconstitutional taking of private property and as a form of
compelled support for causes not of a client's choosing, in
violation of the First Amendment. That aspect of the case was not
before the Supreme Court but can be renewed in the lower court
proceedings that will follow Monday's ruling.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his majority opinion Monday, Phillips vs. Washington Legal
Foundation, No. 96-1578, Rehnquist applied a rule of English common
law that ``interest follows principal.'' Since there was no dispute
that the principal on deposit was the property of the client, the
chief justice said, it followed that ``any interest that does
accrue attaches as a property right incident to the ownership of
the underlying principal.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the case, the chief justice continued, even if at the
end of the day, there was no net interest for the client to
receive. ``We have never held that a physical item is not
`property' simply because it lacks a positive economic or market
value,'' he said, adding, ``The government may not seize rents
received by the owner of a building simply because it can prove
that the costs incurred in collecting the rents exceed the amount
collected.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the use of the property was a ``taking'' within the
meaning of the Fifth Amendment or, if so, whether any ``just
compensation'' would be due to the clients were questions for
another day, the chief justice said.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Souter objected that the court had
announced ``an essentially abstract proposition'' that ``may
ultimately turn out to have no significance'' in resolving the
ultimate constitutional question. If the amount of ``just
compensation'' turned out to be zero, he said, ``there would be no
practical consequence'' to having recognized a property right in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans, which
found the interest to be property in its 1996 ruling but stopped
short of deciding the other questions, will now consider the case
again. ``We're 90 percent of the way home,'' Richard Samp, the
Washington Legal Foundation's chief counsel, said Monday,
predicting that his group would win the next crucial phase.
</P>
<P>
   The program's supporters were more tempered in their
predictions. Jerome J. Shestack, president of the American Bar
Association, said in an interview that IOLTA programs were ``more
vulnerable, but still alive'' under the ruling Monday. He
speculated that if there had been a solid five votes on the court
to decide the ultimate issue against the programs, the majority
would probably have done so now rather than preserve the issue for
another day.

FAMOUS ROMAN BATH BELIEVED DISCOVERED IN ITALY

 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Great as he loomed in the heyday of Rome, the Emperor Augustus
was frail of body and suffered a lifetime of infirmities. In 23
B.C., according to a contemporary account, he almost died of ``an
abscessed liver'' and presumably would have if not for the
restorative power of cold baths in mineral springs. Word of the
emperor's cure touched off one of antiquity's more enduring health
fads.
</P>
<P>
   Cold mineral baths became popular among Romans for at least two
centuries. People abandoned the hot springs of Baiae, a spa near
Pompeii, and flocked to the cold-water resorts of Gabii, near Rome,
or Chiusi, in the Siena district of Tuscany. From personal
experience, the poet Horace sang the praises of a bracing dip in
cold mineral water for curing illnesses of the head and stomach:
</P>
<P>
   ... For Antonius Musa makes Baiae
</P>
<P>
   Useless to me and even makes me unpopular there,
</P>
<P>
   Now that at mid-winter I soak in icy water.
</P>
<P>
   The vogue of cold bathing made Antonius Musa, the emperor's
personal physician, a rich and famous man. The Roman elite sought
him out for prescriptions. Augustus and the Senate rewarded him
with money, the right as a freed slave to wear gold rings and an
exemption from taxes then and in the future for himself and all
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 100 years, archeologists and classics scholars have
been trying to find the springs of Chiusi, where Horace and perhaps
Augustus took the waters. A team of archeologists, led by David
Soren of the University of Arizona in Tucson, may have succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Digging in Tuscany, the archeologists have tapped into a
bubbling spring of cold mineral water and excavated the ruins of
bathhouse columns and an enormous tile-paved swimming pool. All
this is in the right place and seems to fit Horace's description of
the ancient Roman spa. But confirmation may prove impossible, other
archeologists said, short of uncovering an inscription saying that
Augustus or Horace bathed here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are either looking at the famous spring of Chiusi, or at
the very least at one of a series of springs that made this area
famous in antiquity,'' Soren said in a recent interview before
returning to Italy for further excavations.
</P>
<P>
   The style of the wall construction, Soren said, is consistent
with other Roman monuments of the second and first centuries BC.
Pottery scattered in the ruins is also of the same period. The
structures may thus be old enough to have been in use during the
reign of Augustus. The rectangular building at the center of the
site, moreover, resembles the icons used to represent spas on early
Roman road maps.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the large size of the site shows that it was a
major spa complex unlike anything else ever found in the Siena
region and one of the largest anywhere in Italy. Frank Romer, a
classics professor at Arizona, said the excavations ``should reveal
something about Roman medicine and Roman fads at the time everybody
started taking cold baths.''
</P>
<P>
   Tana Allen, an archeologist at the University of Alberta in
Edmonton, who specializes in the healing spas of antiquity,
described the discovery as ``incredibly exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery was made near the modern Tuscan resort of
Chianciano Terme, which already boasts of three cold-water springs
that account for the town's promotional motto, ``It's Chianciano
for a healthy liver.'' But no ruins that could be associated with
an ancient spa had been uncovered until 1993. It was then that
Giulio Paolucci, an Italian archeologist, excavated the first
evidence of late Etruscan and early Roman Imperial structures.
</P>
<P>
   Soren joined the project three years ago, working with local
museums and Tuscany's Department of Antiquities. Excavations
revealed the stonewall outlines of a swimming pool estimated to
have been as large as 60 by 130 feet. Its bottom, paved with roof
tiles, was never more than 3 feet deep, enough for bathers to
immerse their bodies but inadequate for most swimming. Such
dimensions conform to Horace's descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The pool tiles have caused some confusion among archeologists.
Some bear stamps attributed to the second century A.D. Was the pool
built then, well after the other buildings, or was that when it was
remodeled? No one is sure.
</P>
<P>
   From the ruins, archeologists have determined that imposing
brick columns bordered walkways surrounding the pool. At the middle
of the west side, a podium jutted out over the pool, probably
serving as a base for a statue devoted to the gods of bathing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Traces of a marble horse leg were uncovered nearby. Perhaps this
was a piece of the podium statuary. While excavating other
buildings, workers removed mud near a small temple and out flowed a
spring of cold water from the hillside.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the amazing thing for us,'' Soren said. ``The spring
was still there, and the water just started shooting out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Romans were among the first to take seriously the supposed
healing properties of mineral springs, cold or hot. The Greeks
before them had known about mineral waters, but considered them
unhealthy and unwholesome. Even if the Romans found the waters
beneficial, they were no more able to explain any salubrious
qualities than are devotees of mineral baths today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose it felt wonderfully relaxing and comfortable to the
Romans,'' said Allen of the University of Alberta. ``And once you
feel relaxed, your sicknesses start to feel that they are going
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the biographer Suetonius tells that Musa cured Augustus
with cold baths, other contemporaries spoke of ``cold drinks'' of
the mineral water as part of the treatment. If so, patients might
have had reason to think the treatment worse than the illness.
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing the water, Janek Artiola, an environmental scientist
at Arizona, found it full of calcium and sulfates _ not recommended
for drinking. Too much of the calcium could lead to kidney stones.
Even a little of the sulfate would have a strong purgative or
laxative effect.
</P>
<P>
   Horace was apparently wise enough not to drink the spa water. He
suffered from inflammation of the eyes and may have daubed them
with the water. Classicists, Soren said, are fond of an outrageous
pun: ``You can lead a Horace to water but you can't make him
drink.''
</P>
<P>
   The water at the spring today is not that cold _ 64 degrees
Fahrenheit _ but that was apparently what most Romans considered
cold for a bath. The younger Seneca described the spa waters as
``all but hot.'' But he also reported that some old Romans had what
today would be called polar-bear clubs. They would ring in the new
year with a plunge in icy waters.
</P>
<P>
   Within walking distance of the newly discovered spa, excavations
directed by Anna Rastrelli, head of the Chiusi Museum, have turned
up remains of an Etruscan temple in use during the third and second
centuries B.C. Some of the newly assembled pieces of terra-cotta
sculpture, she said, are among ``the most stunning finds of
Etruscan sculpture in recent memory.''
</P>
<P>
   At some time after the temple was destroyed by landslide,
Rastrelli said, its terra-cotta sculptures were gathered and buried
in a deliberate manner. Fragments of the temple's stone columns and
traces of its wooden roof beams were also uncovered, as well as
coins, iron knives and small votive bronzes. Some of the coins were
dated to 200 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most impressive finds, she said, was the sculpture of
a winged woman, who appears to be about to fly off while looking
back and holding a drinking vessel in her left hand. Art historians
see in the winged figure a strong similarity to some feminine
divinities on the frieze of the great altar of Pergamum in what is
now Turkey. Other pieces indicated that the temple was dedicated to
Hercules, the Etruscan patron of healthful waters, and the nymphs
of the adjacent spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this Tuscan land of springs, a temple dedicated to the
water gods of the area would be appropriate,'' Rastrellia said.
``For then, as now, the curative properties of water held a special
meaning.''

CLINTON HONORS 141 YOUNG SCHOLARS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton honored 141 Presidential Scholars
Monday, saying their ``brain power could light up this entire
city.''
</P>
<P>
   In a South Lawn ceremony, Clinton awarded medals to students
from across the country for their accomplishments in arts,
academics, leadership and community service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think the Presidential Scholars award was a final
honor for all of the work I did in high school, but I realize now
that it is only the beginning,'' said Christopher J. Hossfeld, 18,
from Concord-Carlisle Regional (Mass.) High School. ``This is
really an inspiration to go on and do more.''
</P>
<P>
   Hossfeld, who received the award for his skills as a composer,
said he will be attending Harvard this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Each student was asked to nominate an outstanding teacher, who
would also receive a presidential award.
</P>
<P>
   Hossfeld nominated his chorus teacher, Roger Mansen, who said he
was honored to receive an award but was beaming with pride for his
pupil.
</P>

   ``I've been teaching for 25 years, and Chris has been the
absolute finest student I've ever had,'' Mansen said. ``I
definitely think we will be hearing from him soon in the arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Those in Washington will be hearing from Hossfeld as soon as
Wednesday, when one of his compositions, ``Sonata for Solo Viola,''
will make its debut at the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts. A fellow classmate, Sarah Darling, will perform
the piece.
</P>
<P>
   Also winning an arts award was Sarah B. Lamb, 17, from Brookline
(Mass.) High School, a ballet dancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just wonderful, and getting to meet all of these
interesting, accomplished people is great,'' she said. ``I really
give a lot of credit to my school, Brookline, for giving me the
quality education it took to get this far. I feel lucky that I was
able to go to such a good school.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb plans to enroll in the Boston Ballet School after working a
year for the Boston Ballet. She nominated her ballet teacher,
Tatiana Legat, for the teachers award.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect SAT score of 1600 helped Neal E. Rosenberg, 18, from
Sharon (Mass.) High School, earn his medal. ``It's a great honor _
a once in a lifetime thing, and I'm just trying to enjoy every
minute of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg, who will major in finance at the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business this fall, said he hopes
to work on Wall Street after college.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg's English teacher, Tony Pane, who was honored with a
presidential award for educators, said his former student amazed
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get many students in the course of your career who
do everything well _ I mean everything,'' he said. ``It was to the
point that I had to put Neal's papers on the bottom of the stack
when I was grading, because his papers always raised the standard
for everybody else.''

LONG-TERM RATES HIT LOWEST LEVEL IN 30 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Long-term government interest rates fell to their
lowest level in 30 years Monday while other government yields,
including those that effect home mortgage rates, dropped sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in interest rates, which has seen the 30-year yield
fall half a percentage point since the end of April, is the kind
that could help support economic growth by boosting the housing
industry and making loans for capital investment cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   That would make it harder for the Federal Reserve to achieve a
sustained slowdown that would make policy makers less worried about
inflation and less likely to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's sharp fall in the stock market, which capped a
week-long decline that left the Nasdaq composite index down 10.5
percent from its recent high and the Dow Jones industrial average
off 6.3 percent, has some analysts wondering about the near-term
economic outlook.
</P>
<P>
   A prolonged fall in the stock market, or even just a long period
of inconclusive ups and downs, could have a chilling effect on
consumer spending, as investors decide they may not be as wealthy
as they had thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``The equity market is key,'' said Robert DiClemente, chief U.S.
economist at Salomon Smith Barney. ``If equities don't hold up it
would neutralize the effects from interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said last week that such
a cooling in the stock market was one way that Fed could get the
slowing in growth policy that makers say they need.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts pointed to the economic turmoil in Asia, problems in
Russia and, possibly, some new doubts about the American stock
market, for reasons why investors seemed to be rushing to the safe
harbor of the American bond market.
</P>
<P>
   The 70-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average after 3:30
p.m. Monday that pushed the day's decline over 200 points came as
the yield on the 30-year bond dropped from 5.61 percent to 5.58
percent, down from 5.66 percent Friday. The price of the bond,
which moves in the opposite direction, rose 1 6/32 to 107 26/32.
</P>
<P>
   According to Salomon Brothers, the yield is the lowest for
long-term government rates since the fall of 1968, a time when
interest rates were rising sharply because of the Vietnam War and
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 10-year note, which is used in setting mortgage
interest rates, also fell, dropping to 5.35 percent from 5.42
percent Friday. That is the lowest 10-year yields have been since
the fall of 1993. In January of this year, when the 10-year yield
fell to 5.36 percent, mortgage interest rates were at four-year
lows.
</P>
<P>
   Shorter-term interest rates have also fallen sharply recently,
which in part is in response to the foreign money that is coming
into the American market, analysts said. The yield on the two-year
Treasury note fell to 5.38 percent Monday from 5.43 percent Friday
and 5.57 percent in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Where interest rates go from here is unclear. Analysts said they
could go lower if the turmoil in Asia continues and foreigners send
more money here. But some think that there is not enough data yet
proving that the economy is slowing from its recent, rapid 4
percent-plus pace to warrant a big further decline in long-term
rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to go below 5.5 percent on a sustained basis, there
will need to be more evidence that the economy is slowing on a
sustainable basis, not just a flight to quality,'' said Donald
Fine, the chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management.

SMARTALK ACQUIRES BAY STATE MARKETING FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHANA R. SCHOENBERGER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking to acquire a consumer direct-marketing division,
SmarTalk TeleServices Inc. has acquired Worldwide Direct, a
Framingham, Mass. company that markets cellular telephones through
TV advertisements, for $44.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, started 10 months ago by Victor Grillo Jr., 32, and
Lloyd Lapidus, 29, will have more than $50 million in sales this
year, Grillo said.
</P>
<P>
   The company will keep its Framingham operations and its 175
employees when it becomes SmarTalk's consumer marketing division,
said Lapidus, who will become the new division's executive vice
president. Grillo will run the SmarTalk division.
</P>
<P>
   Lapidus and Grillo owned about 60 percent of the firm; Global
Retail Partners, a venture capital fund run by the New York
investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, owned the remainder
of Worldwide's shares.
</P>
<P>
   SmarTalk, a Columbus, Ohio, seller of prepaid telephone cards
with $300 million in sales this year, wanted to add direct
marketing to its retail and wholesale operations, said Joseph A.
Boroez, SmarTalk's senior vice president for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one channel missing in our portfolio, which was direct
sales,'' Boroez said. ``We identified the expert, which was
Worldwide Direct.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Worldwide operates a 24-hour, seven-day call center
in Framingham, which fills orders from the company's TV
commercials, which air nationwide. Famed TV personality Dick Clark
is the company's celebrity spokesperson. Phones arrive at
customers' doors within 24 hours, Grillo said.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition also allows SmarTalk to better refine a prepaid
cellular product it had planned to launch in the third quarter by
combining the new product with Worldwide's existing line, Boroez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Grillo said the sale combines the two companies' strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could sell telephones and long-distance cards on TV, and
they currently sell the long-distance cards at retail and could
also sell our cell phones at retail,'' he said.

COURT RULES THAT PRISON INMATES ARE PROTECTED BY DISABILITIES ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Monday that state prison
inmates are protected by a federal law that bans discrimination
against the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous decision, the court said the Pennsylvania
Department of Corrections was wrong when it refused to allow a
former prisoner to take part in a motivational boot camp program
because he suffered from high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that the state's refusal violated the 1990
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which bans discrimination of
a ``qualified individual with a disability'' by a ``public entity''
on account of that person's disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``State prisons fall squarely within the statutory definition of
public entity,'' Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three other states had joined Pennsylvania's appeal,
arguing that the ADA has led to inmate demands ``of all sorts, many
of them exceedingly unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marjorie Rifkin of the American Civil Liberties Union's
National Prison Project said that ``there has not in fact been a
flood of lawsuits'' by inmates.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Ronald Yeskey was sentenced to prison for 18 to 36
months for drunken driving, escape and resisting arrest. In
imposing the sentence, the court recommended that Yeskey be
assigned to a boot camp designed to offer training and instill
discipline that the state's correction's department operated. If he
successfully completed the program, Yeskey would have been released
after six months.
</P>
<P>
   But the department refused to put him in the program because of
his hypertension. It also denied him entry into any alternative
program for disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   Yeskey, who has since completed his sentence, sued for damages,
claiming the department's refusal violated the ADA.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge threw out Yeskey's lawsuit, agreeing with
Pennsylvania authorities that the ADA did not apply to state
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997 the 3d U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the
lower court and reinstated the suit, saying the law's broad
language covered the prisons even though they were not specifically
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia upheld the appeals court's decision, writing that the law
``includes anyone with a disability ... and that includes
prisoners.'' He also said prison programs do fall under the ADA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern prisons provide inmates with many recreational
activities, medical services and educational and vocational
programs,'' he wrote. ``The text of the ADA provides no basis for
distinguishing these programs, services and activities from those
provided by public entities that are not prisons.''
</P>
<P>
   In another decision Monday, the court put in jeopardy a
multistate program that provides some $100 million a year for legal
help for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices ruled in a Texas case that the
interest earned from short-term trust accounts that lawyers hold
for their clients are the private property of those clients.
</P>
<P>
   The case revolved around a little-known program called Interest
on Lawyers' Trust Accounts, or IOLTA, which exists in some form in
every state.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys handling small amounts of clients' funds routinely
pool them into one trust account. The clients' sums by themselves
are too small or are deposited for too short a period to generate
interest.
</P>
<P>
   However, the combined monies do produce interest. Depending on
the state, lawyers are either required or urged to forward that
interest to a designated agency, which then doles it out to legal
aid programs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, William Summers, a retired contractor from Missouri
City, near Houston, who had money deposited in mandatory IOLTA
accounts, challenged the Texas IOLTA program, known as the Texas
Equal Access to Justice Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Summers, joined by the conservative Washington Legal Foundation
here, argued that the Texas program, which takes in up to $10
million annually, violated the Fifth Amendment by taking private
property without just compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When interest is earned on money, the interest belongs to the
person whose principle generated the interest,'' Richard Samp, an
attorney for Summers, told the high court.
</P>
<P>
   The sharply divided court stopped short of killing all such
programs. Instead, it sent the Texas case back to a lower court for
a determination of whether the state has ``taken'' private property
and must pay ``just compensation'' for it.
</P>
<P>
   Today's decision upheld a 1996 ruling in which the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals found that the interest generated was the
property of the lawyers' clients _ raising the possibility that any
diversion and pooling of that money might be an unlawful taking of
private property. Other appeals courts had reached the opposite
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court majority, Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist said, ``We hold that the interest income generated by
funds held in IOLTA accounts is the `private property' of the owner
of the principal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rehnquist added: ``We express no view as to whether these
funds have been `taken' by the state; nor do we express an opinion
as to the amount of `just compensation,' if any, is due'' to those
who sued.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Rehnquist were Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg
and Stephen G. Breyer dissented.

DOMESTIC PARTNERS BILL GETS BOOST IN COURT RULING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANTHONY FLINT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ An advisory ruling issued Monday by Massachusetts' top
court has cleared the way for the Legislature to allow Boston to
extend employment benefits to the partners and dependents of gay
city workers _ vaulting Boston into the company of only a handful
of major cities to take the controversial step.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Judicial Court, at the request of House Speaker
Thomas J. Finneran, said it was appropriate for Beacon Hill to
authorize cities and towns to extend benefits such as health
insurance to domestic partners of gay employees, and that
municipalities crafting such measures were would not run afoul of
the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The city's proposal is at the State House in the form of a home
rule petition a local ordinance that needs state approval. Finneran
was mum on his plans Monday, but backers say he has promised to
move the bill if his technical questions were answered by the SJC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The games are over. It's time to move on this bill,'' said
City Councilor Thomas M. Keane Jr., the measure's author.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate the speaker will move this bill regardless of
his personal feelings about the subject,'' said state
Representative Byron Rushing (D-Boston), who shepherded the cause
along with fellow Representative Paul DeMakis (D-Boston). ``He
thought there were constitutional problems with the whole shebang.
The only way to get agreement to move the bill was to have these
questions answered. And now they have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran had asked the court two questions: Whether it was
necessary for the state Legislature to act on the matter or could
Boston could just enact an ordinance on its own; and two, whether
the bill was unconstitutional because it allowed Boston and not the
state to define the term ``domestic partner'' and ``dependents.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran was concerned about letting cities and towns define
those terms because it could lead to a legal thicket if benefits
were extended to unmarried heterosexual couples, for example, or to
elderly sisters siblings that lived together.
</P>
<P>
   The SJC judges declined to answer the first question, although
they suggested there was no reason the state Legislature couldn't
pass such a measure. On the second question, the judges said there
wasn't anything unconstitutional about letting cities and towns
define the terms in their legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a clear green light,'' said Mary Bonauto, attorney for
Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, a legal advocacy group.
``The court doesn't see anything novel about this. Cities and towns
would be implementing the basic function of protecting their
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonauto and others said the ruling was significant in a broader
context because it recognizes that health plans for domestic
partners serve the same purposes as employer-provided benefits
generally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Benefits are part of the overall compensation, and if some
people are not allowed this benefit because of their sexual
orientation, they are not getting fair compensation. It's a
question of fairness -- equal pay for equal work,'' said Rushing.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Springfield, Cambridge and Northampton extend
benefits to the partners of gay employees. Those cities did not ask
the Legislature for approval to enact those acts. Nationally, San
Francisco was the first major city to pass a domestic partners
ordinance, joined by Seattle, New York, Los Angeles and Atlanta.
Vermont has a statewide measure.
</P>
<P>
   Boston does not know exactly how many employees would be
affected by the measure, though rough estimates don't exceed a few
hundred at most.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always difficult to measure because this requires you to
come out to get it,'' said Rushing. Also, he added, the partners of
many gay employees are employed and are part of a group health
insurance plans already.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHANAL, Mexico _ When Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia comes to this
town, he wears a metal helmet as protection against bullets, and he
walks surrounded by burly bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz is in charge of the Roman Catholic diocese that includes
most of the southern state of Chiapas. But he cannot enter the
white stucco church in the central square here to celebrate Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-government Indian officials in charge of the town threatened
violence against the bishop and his followers if they tried to
approach the church on a visit he made to the town in March. On the
eve of the visit, top Chiapas state officials publicly implored him
to cancel it.
</P>
<P>
   All across Indian regions of Chiapas are towns where government
supporters are fiercely at odds with Catholics who are loyal to
Ruiz and the Diocese of San Cristobal de las Casas, which he has
headed for 38 years.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop, 73, preaches a passionately egalitarian message,
calling on Indians to reject the virtual caste system under which
they are routinely abused or ignored.
</P>
<P>
   But many government supporters and followers of other faiths
reject Ruiz's message. They say he moved behind the scenes to
foment the 1994 uprising by Zapatista guerrillas, and they blame
him for the economic downturn and chronic tensions in Chiapas since
then.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz denies that he helped the Zapatistas' armed movement,
although he admits to sympathizing with their call for more justice
for Indians. His enemies have never been able to prove their
charges. But the hatred has spilled out nevertheless in a campaign
of violence against Catholics and their churches.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, when the Zapatista conflict began, 40 Catholic
churches or chapels have been burned, destroyed or closed by
opponents of Ruiz. Today, 14 of the churches remain closed.
Hundreds of Catholics have had to flee their homes or to worship in
virtual hiding in their villages.
</P>
<P>
   Last Nov. 7, Ruiz and another bishop barely escaped from an
ambush on a dirt road in another Chiapas region. Neither bishop was
injured, but three Bible teachers suffered bullet wounds. The
diocese blamed a pro-government paramilitary group called Justice
and Peace, which had threatened Ruiz. The group denied having
anything to do with the attack.
</P>
<P>
   One place where the church is closed to Catholics is Chanal, a
hillside village of corn-farming Tzeltal Indians whose town council
is controlled by supporters of the pro-government Institutional
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of residents practice their own form of
Catholicism, called traditional, a mixture of Catholic and
pre-Hispanic Mayan religions. They do not read the Bible or regard
it as a sacred text. Almost all of them are pro-government.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, 1994, the day when masked and armed Zapatista
guerrillas initiated a short-lived uprising with military attacks
across Chiapas, some of them swooped into Chanal and gutted the
town hall with fire. Villagers said the Zapatistas did not have
many supporters in Chanal.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that the mayor, a PRI member, convened a meeting to
vent his rage about the attack. The mayor picked on a leader of a
Catholic opposition group in Chanal, even though it was an
above-ground organization that had no apparent ties to the
Zapatista guerrillas, and slapped the man across the face in front
of all of the townspeople. Within days hundreds of Catholics took
the mayor's message and fled.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since then, Chanal leaders have told the diocese that they
want Ruiz to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in this town don't like Samuel Ruiz, because in
1994 he organized people to go to war,'' said Celestino Diaz Perez,
35, a member of the PRI town council, sitting at the long wooden
council table in the reconstructed town hall. ``They don't want him
to come here or go into the church, because he might start
organizing the war again.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the doors of the church remain open, a caretaker
designated from among ``traditional'' Catholics is always inside.
He allows ``traditionals'' to use the church to worship St. Peter
the Martyr, the town's patron. But his instructions are to bar
Roman Catholics from holding any kind of service, although they may
enter individually.
</P>
<P>
   Agustin Mendez Santiz, 57, a PRI justice of the peace, explained
his point of view: ``We `traditionals' are in charge of preserving
the customs of our people. And our people do not want Catholics in
this church.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Catholics who had fled have returned to Chanal but continue
to live almost clandestinely. A group of them built a wooden shed
big enough for a prayer service. But knowing that PRI followers
regard Catholic meetings as potential organizing cells for the
Zapatista guerrillas, they put a clay bread oven in one corner and
use it as a bakery during the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a chapel,'' various Catholics insisted to a
stranger, looking furtively out the window to see if hostile PRI
followers were approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get together to read the Bible,'' said Emilio Lopez Diaz,
24, one of the Catholics. ``We're not buying arms, and we're not
organizing.''
</P>
<P>
   They were eagerly awaiting the arrival of Ruiz several days
later, who was coming to conduct baptisms and to name some
community catechists, or Bible teachers. During his visit, Ruiz did
not celebrate Mass, but only conducted a simple but crowded prayer
service in a private house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus tells us the path we must take should be different from
the path of the powerful, the people who build their own strength
by taking away what others have,'' Ruiz said in his homily, once
again articulating the theological message that has so antagonized
the powers that be in Chiapas. ``Those people destroy themselves,
because they have no spiritual growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has added new fuel to the grass-roots conflict by
mounting a fierce political assault on Ruiz. The Interior Ministry
has harassed foreigners who work with the human rights office of
the diocese, deporting several.
</P>
<P>
   And PRI delegates to the state legislature presented a motion to
have Bishop Ruiz declared a traitor to his country.
</P>
<P>
   (On June 7, Bishop Ruiz resigned from his four-year role as the
chief mediator in peace talks between the government and the
Zapatistas, citing the government's ``constant and growing
aggression'' against the diocese as one of his reasons.)
</P>
<P>
   Priests in the diocese say they fear that the conflict has
become so rancorous that they may never be able to bring the
Catholic faith to many of the Indian communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are afraid that divisions are emerging that will be
irreconcilable,'' said the Rev. Felipe Toussaint, a leading
clergyman of the diocese. ``We are afraid we are losing the
possibility of dialogue with many people.''

GERMAN BANK RAIDED IN TAX-DODGE INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Three hundred criminal investigators
descended Monday on Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, looking
for evidence that bank executives helped wealthy customers
illegally avoid taxes.
</P>
<P>
   It was the biggest single raid on a German bank in connection
with tax avoidance, a national obsession among wealthy Germans that
is estimated to cost the government more than $10 billion a year in
lost revenues.
</P>
<P>
   There is little mystery as to why wealthy Germans work so hard
at tax avoidance. On average, Germans give up about 50 percent of
their income to the government in the form of regular taxes, social
security and retirement payments, a special tax surcharge to
rebuild the former East Germany, and a 16 percent value-added tax
on most sales.
</P>
<P>
   Although Deutsche Bank has so far stayed out of trouble,
Germany's other big banks have all endured raids in recent years,
and a few top executives have been forced to resign because they
themselves were evading taxes.
</P>
<P>
   As in previous investigations of Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank,
among other financial institutions, prosecutors suspect that that
bank executives knowingly helped customers shift money to tax
havens like Switzerland and Luxembourg, where customers use
anonymous accounts to earn interest and capital gains that they do
not report to German tax authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Frankfurt said Monday that their raid came partly
as a result of information from people who had confessed to tax
evasion. Jan Tilmann, Frankfurt's chief prosecutor, said the
investigation was still at the early stages, but that he had reason
to suspect that Deutsche Bank executives may have collaborated with
their customers in illegal tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is evidence that unknown Deutsche Bank officials made it
possible for customers to anonymously move money out of the
country,'' Tilmann said. ``The measures taken to veil the
identities of bank customers also raise the suspicion that the
responsible bank workers at the least took into account the
possibility they were helping customers evade taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning at 10 a.m., the army of investigators showed up at
Deutsche Bank's headquarters here in Frankfurt as well as at key
branches in neighboring cities. The investigators seized thousands
of documents relating to the transfer of money and securities to
Luxembourg and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   German prosecutors and tax officials have become extremely
aggressive about going after tax dodgers in the last two years. By
one estimate, Germans have moved more than $300 billion out of the
country at a potential cost in lost tax revenue of more than $10
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The use of legal tax loopholes, as well as illegal maneuvers,
was a major drain on the Treasury last year. To stop the
hemorrhage, tax authorities have raided banks and stepped up tax
audits of businesses and wealthy individuals.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new pressure has prompted a growing number of wealthy people
to give themselves up voluntarily, acknowledging that they failed
to pay their proper taxes in exchange for avoiding criminal
indictments. One of the most well-known cases last year involved
Hans-Georg Hofmann, then the head of Dresdner Bank's investment
banking operations.
</P>
<P>
   Hofmann voluntarily admitted that he owed taxes of several
million dollars on money he had earned in Switzerland. When word
reached the public, Hoffman was forced to resign from his post.

 By TIM HERRERA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Father's Day reminds me of dinosaurs.
 &HT;    No, I don't mean that it makes me feel like one. It makes me
think of those big extinct reptiles with the sharp teeth, nasty
claws and ...
 &HT;    But I'm getting ahead of myself.
 &HT;    I know about Father's Day, and as the father of four I've done
pretty well by it. I can go a month without washing underwear. My
necktie collection rivals that of many department stores. I own
countless mugs, T-shirts and finger-paint artwork proclaiming
``WORLD'S GREATEST DAD!''
 &HT;    I treasure every handcrafted present my three boys and one
daughter have ever made, because they made them for me. But I was
looking for something a little different this time around.
 &HT;    ``What do you want for Father's Day this year?'' my boys asked.
 &HT;    ``What if you guys quit fighting for Father's Day?'' I replied.
 &HT;    This was no small request. A day rarely goes by in our house
without ``He hit me!'' followed by ``He hit me first!'' Then comes
the witty ``Did-not-did-too!'' exchange.
 &HT;    I was asking for a one-day truce, one that even NATO diplomats
would have trouble arranging. The treaty didn't have to be in
writing _ I'd accept a verbal agreement, with or without
handshakes.
 &HT;    I'd do a lot for an entire day without hearing ``Dork!'', ``Dog
breath!'' or something worse echoing through our house as the kids
battle for the Nintendo, the VCR or the remote control _ my remote
control.
 &HT;    But my request didn't go over very well. Either they didn't
understand or they knew the mission was impossible. Besides, they
clearly had ideas of their own.
 &HT;    ``Yeah, no fighting's good, Dad,'' they said. ``But how 'bout if
we go to the movies like we did last year? Maybe we can go see
`Godzilla?'''
 &HT;    ``What the heck,'' I said. ``Who needs peace and tranquility,
anyway?''
 &HT;    It seems we are forming a Father's Day tradition. Last year, we
also commemorated the day by watching loud, frightening, scaly
creatures on the rampage. No, we weren't watching ``The Jerry
Springer Show'' or anything on C-Span _ we went to see ``The Lost
World.''
 &HT;    It was a memorable day, but not because of the film. It was
memorable because the outing was their idea.
 &HT;    I ended up taking our two older boys _ ages 8 and 10 _ to the
``Jurassic Park'' sequel. I felt the younger kids were too little
to watch dinosaurs devour screaming humans, even at matinee prices.
 &HT;    While driving to the theater with the boys, I started thinking
about my father and the only time I could ever remember just the
two of us going to the movies.
 &HT;    It was a cool, spring Pennsylvania day. Dad and I carried light
jackets as we walked to the old Memorial Theater to see a
``Batman'' movie, strolling along the steep hills, past the
Veterans Memorial and my school, St. Joseph's Elementary.
 &HT;    Dad was barely 5-foot-4, but I was still much smaller and
struggled to keep up with his quick stride.
 &HT;    Sometimes I get angry because I can't recall everything about
that day. However, I am grateful for one image still floating in my
mind: I remember looking over, seeing the light from the movie
screen flickering on Dad's face and thinking how cool it was that
he was just spending time with me.
 &HT;    All the way home from the theater, I replayed the film for my
father. Since Dad laughed, I was positive he had liked the movie as
much as I had. But I never really found out _ I never thought to
ask.
 &HT;    Dad died about five years ago. A very compassionate physician
bit his lip and searched for the medically precise but nonetheless
sensitive words to explain to my mother and me that they could do
no more for my father. But the look of defeat on Dad's face told me
more than any doctor could.
 &HT;    Questions flooded my mind during his last moments. Could he tell
me one more World War II story? Did he know I put the scratch in
his Ford Grand Torino? Did he really want to see the Batman movie,
or did he go because I begged?
 &HT;    Dad didn't die on Father's Day, but every third Sunday in June I
think of our day at the movies.
 &HT;    As my sons and I walked out of the theater after ``The Lost
World,'' our eyes adjusting to the sunlight glaring off the parking
lot, my middle son turned and asked: ``Dad, did you like the
movie?''
 &HT;    ``I sure did, pal.''
 &HT;    He'll never know how glad I am that he asked.

<P>
   Every Christmas season, Janet Whitney and her three children
make and decorate 350-plus gingerbread-man cookies, filling three
tables in their home in Irvine, Calif. They decorate the house with
them, and give them to friends and relatives as well.
</P>
<P>
   The gingerbread men are a much-anticipated Whitney tradition, as
is breakfast out every Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids really look forward to our breakfasts together, and
we rarely miss a weekend,'' Whitney says. ``They know they can
count on that special time with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Family traditions and rituals, at holidays or other times, were
once common. But today, due to divorce, separated families, long
work hours and television, many traditions have been forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   This is unfortunate, experts say, because traditions and rituals
can be a reassuring anchor during troubled times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family dinners, holidays, birthdays and special times specific
to each family give children and adults a sense of security and
stability when there's so much unpredictability in the outside
world,'' says therapist Joanie Heinemann of Coastline Counseling
Center in Newport Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In family therapy, mental-health experts actually prescribe
rituals and traditions, says Richard Golden, a family counselor in
Woodland Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditions and rituals anchor families, make members feel
special and communicate value and meaning to kids,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   They also help in the important task of putting boundaries on
times of mourning and celebration, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditions and rituals, such as funerals and anniversaries,
give you a time to indulge emotions and then contain them so they
don't bleed over into everyday life,'' Golden says. ``Rituals can
also give participants a valuable sense of family history.''
</P>
<P>
   Every August, Maria Gonzalez and her extended family honor her
father by holding a special mass in his name around the anniversary
of his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all attend church in our old East Los Angeles neighborhood,
and then we go to my mom's house or a restaurant for breakfast or
lunch,'' says Gonzalez, a 41-year-old, second-generation
Mexican-American.
</P>
<P>
   After eating, family members travel to her father's grave, where
they pray silently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all really miss our father,'' Gonzalez says. ``He and my
mother were married 45 years. Although this day is sad and we
always cry when we visit the grave, it gives us a chance to
remember him among ourselves. We also take the opportunity to tell
the grandchildren about their grandfather.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditions are what wonderful memories are made of, Heinemann
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``People won't have warm, fuzzy feelings about the television
shows they watched,'' she says, ``but they will cherish times spent
with family.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace Means, 39, of South Gate, Calif., says she now understands
why her parents found rituals and traditions so important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditions create family unity and a belief in something,''
she says. ``They give you a sense of peace, which is critical in
today's stressful world.''
</P>
<P>
   Every other Sunday, Means takes her three daughters to church
and breakfast. Then they spend the day together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take the time to review the week and catch up on each
other's lives,'' she says. ``This keeps us connected.''
</P>
<P>
   Means, who is Mexican-American, also has traditions she has
carried over from her own childhood, including cuddling up with
Mexican hot chocolate and pan dulce on winter nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hot chocolate and sweetbread is a symbol of unity and
communication in my family,'' she says. ``I've passed this
tradition on to my daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   A week before Christmas each year, Means gets together with her
mother and sisters to make tamales for their Christmas Eve feast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful time when we talk and listen to Christmas
music,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   With her children, Means started her own Christmas tradition of
making or buying each of them a special Christmas-tree ornament
every year. Her daughters will take the ornaments with them as
keepsakes when they move out.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Greene, of North Tustin, Calif., shares Hannukah rituals
with his family, but he thinks that rituals at other times of the
year may be even more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to remember and practice rituals and traditions
during the holidays,'' he says. ``Incorporating them throughout the
year is just as important, and we make a conscious effort to do
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene and his wife, Carol, have taken a trip to the country
every year since their daughter, now 3, was an infant. In late
September or early October, they spend a day picking fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make memories on that trip that we wouldn't have if we'd
simply gone to the market and bought apples,'' Carol Greene says.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenes also believe in using family traditions to educate
their child, who has gone to the polls with her parents in every
general and primary election.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year she watched the election results with us, and was
well-versed on the different propositions,'' Greene says.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenes also have important daily rituals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever drops Sarah off at school will tell her to do her best
and make herself proud,'' her father says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rituals are so important because they give children a sense of
belonging and a certain amount of security,'' Carol Greene says.
``They are good for adults too. I know our rituals and traditions
give me a warm, secure feeling.''
 &UR; SIDEBAR: DO-IT-YOURSELF RITUALS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rituals and traditions add variety and richness to life. Best of
all, they don't have to be complicated, says Elizabeth Berg, author
of ``Family Traditions: Celebrations for Holidays and Everyday''
(Reader's Digest, l994).
</P>
<P>
   ``A ritual or tradition can be as simple as something you do
every night, like read a story to a small child, or something you
do weekly, such as go out for Chinese food,'' Berg says.
</P>
<P>
   You may think you have no family rituals, but that's usually not
true, she adds. You probably have special rituals unique to your
family, even if you don't think of them as such.
</P>
<P>
   To incorporate rituals and traditions into your life, she and
other experts suggest that you do the following:
</P>
<P>
   + Recognize existing traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Look around to see what you're already doing on a regular basis
that is unique to your family, and give the activity the status it
deserves.
</P>
<P>
   + Augment traditions.
</P>
<P>
   If you're already reading stories to the kids at night, cuddle
up in the winter under a special story quilt.
</P>
<P>
   + Start small.
</P>
<P>
   Begin with one ritual and incorporate it before trying another.
Holidays are a natural time to begin family rituals.
</P>
<P>
   + Have weekly family conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Weekly talks give family members a chance to express problems
and share solutions. Just make sure that no one shouts or accuses.
</P>
<P>
   + Start a family-activities jar.
</P>
<P>
   Have each family member put suggestions for family outings in a
jar, and then pick one a week to do.
</P>
<P>
   + Choose traditions that teach values.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsoring an underprivileged family at Christmas or visiting
nursing homes on a monthly basis will teach your children
invaluable lessons.
</P>
<P>
   + Try simple, inexpensive rituals.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most memorable traditions and rituals are free. Read
books or poetry, play games, put together puzzles, listen to music,
bake, sew, do crafts, garden, hike or go on picnics.
</P>
<P>
   + Gather ideas from friends and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   When a friend or family member tells you about a great
tradition, try it yourself. Record ideas in a notebook.
</P>
<P>
   + Use a calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Until they are ingrained habits, some traditions and rituals
must be put on the calendar so you can make time for them and plan.
</P>
<P>
   + Prioritize.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you're too busy for family traditions, take a hard
look at your schedule and make some cuts. Saying no to some
obligations means saying yes to your family.
</P>
<P>
   + Replace outdated traditions.
</P>
<P>
   As children age and life changes, some traditions may no longer
be appropriate. Don't be afraid to try something new.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The trouble started at lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   My 2-year-old daughter Sarah had asked for grilled cheese, but I
had unwittingly committed an unpardonable sin: I'd cut her sandwich
into fours instead of twos.
</P>
<P>
   It was fortunate that the plate was plastic, because Sarah
expressed her annoyance by flinging it to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to stay calm, I brought out the yogurt _ cherry vanilla,
her favorite. But, silly me, I'd mixed the raisins into the yogurt
instead of letting her put them on top herself.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, though, I managed to catch the container before it
went the way of the grilled cheese.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Mommy lost it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I tell parents of toddlers is to expect the
unexpected,'' says Patricia Henderson Shimm, associate director of
the Center for Toddler Development at Barnard College in New York.
``The second thing I tell them is not to take their child's
behavior personally. Your toddler is not maliciously defying you to
make your life miserable, to get back at you, or because you're a
terrible mom or dad.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary task of being a toddler, Shimm explains, is to test
you _ that's how she learns and grows emotionally, physically and
socially.
</P>
<P>
   As you tell your toddler, again and again, which rules and
limits she needs to observe in order to be social as well as safe,
she begins to absorb the information and learn how to get along
with others. Not surprisingly, she has countless questions about
this process and her role in it, and she needs to test you until
she arrives at answers that make sense to her.
</P>
<P>
   Toddlers repeat annoying or even destructive behavior to make
sure they understand the rules: ``I drew on the walls and Mommy
yelled. But will she always yell? Is it ever OK to draw on the
walls? Let me try again and show Mommy what I did. Then I'll see
how she reacts, and I'll know for sure what the rule really is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By continually bumping up against parental rules and pushing
against the boundaries of acceptable behavior, children develop
self-confidence and a sense of their abilities,'' says Linda
Dunlap, chair of the department of psychology at Marist College in
Poughkeepsie, N.Y. ``I would worry if a toddler weren't defiant and
didn't say no.''
 &UR; A WHOLE NEW WORLD &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The downside of a toddler's exhilarating discovery that he is
his own person is a sometimes-overwhelming panic at having to make
the very choices he yearns to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toddler's world can be a scary place,'' Shimm says.
``Everything seems new, big and unpredictable, so to gain control
over his environment, a child this age may be tyrannical, stubborn
and rigid.''
</P>
<P>
   He may insist on arranging his stuffed animals in precise order
on the bed every night or, as my daughter did, fly into a rage when
you don't allow him to place raisins on top of his yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to defuse manipulative behavior and instill
cooperation is to hone your negotiating and mediating skills,''
says Mark Roberts, director of clinical training in the psychology
department at Idaho State University in Pocatello. ``The wise
parent stays a step ahead of a toddler, and fights only those
battles that are absolutely necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing how and when to set reasonable limits, enforcing them
when you must and compromising when you can is tricky. But you can
do it _ and here's how:
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; ALLOW SOME TESTING _ BUT NOT TOO MUCH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Establish limits you can consistently and confidently enforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, the single most important thing a parent can
do is to set expectations and rules that are responsive and
appropriate to a child's needs,'' Roberts says.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a child wants to work on a mural and is headed
for the dining room with her paints and paper, you might say, ``I
know you really want to paint right now, but we paint on the
kitchen floor in our house.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents, however, set too many limits. This not only can
stifle a child's natural curiosity and spirit, but also can set up
a power struggle that the parents will probably lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents who constantly complain about their child's
rule-breaking are probably making too many rules in the first
place,'' Shimm says.
 &UR; SAY NO LESS OFTEN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason a toddler's favorite word is `no' is because he
hears it so frequently,'' Shimm says.
</P>
<P>
   While you can't avoid the word entirely, you can start by making
a toddler's world safe enough that you don't have to use it so
often.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to avoid saying no is to rephrase your commands: ``I
wish I could let you splash all that tub water onto the floor _ but
we'd have such a mess. How about using this bucket?''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of saying, ``Do you want to get dressed now?'' make a
positive statement such as, ``Let's both get dressed right now.''
Or offer a choice: ``Do you want to put on the Barney shirt or the
Mickey Mouse one?''
 &UR; GIVE TODDLERS WORDS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A young child can't say, ``Gee, Mom, I had a tough day and I'm
really stressed.'' Instead, she'll show you by throwing rolls in a
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   However, once you label her feelings for her _ ``You're tired,
and as soon as we leave you can sleep in the car'' _ she'll begin
to understand what's going on inside and will be less likely to
test you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Helping a child to interpret her feelings boosts her
self-esteem because it tells her that you're aware of, and care
about, what she's thinking and feeling,'' Roberts says.
 &UR; DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Toddlers aren't born knowing how to behave,'' Roberts says.
``They have to be socialized.''
</P>
<P>
   While you should encourage their burgeoning independence and
curiosity, you must, at the same time, temper a toddler's behavior
and teach him that it's not acceptable, for example, to bite
another person, to scream on an airplane or to run into the street.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, your lessons will most likely need to be repeated over
and over again until your child knows that you mean business.
 &UR; BE READY FOR THE UNEXPECTED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind the realities of toddlerhood, and prepare for them.
</P>
<P>
   For example, transitions of any kind _ leaving a playdate or
turning off the television to eat dinner _ may trigger testing
behaviors, often because a child is tired and her newly emerging
ability to cope is at a low point.
</P>
<P>
   Times of family stress _ illness, financial trouble, marital
problems _ are also hard on children. Kids are aware of these
difficult periods, even though they don't understand what's behind
them.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, a toddler's life is filled with stresses of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toilet training, learning to share, joining a playgroup or
adjusting to a new sibling are all milestones in a toddler's life
that can upset her internal equilibrium and trigger a power
struggle,'' Shimm says. ``Preparing for them is your best weapon.''
 &UR; DON'T BE TOO HARD ON YOURSELF &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Raising a toddler is difficult, and rare is the parent who
doesn't lose it at some point.
</P>
<P>
   If you do lose control, Shimm says, ``the best remedy is an
apology and a hug. Children are immensely forgiving.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sharpen your sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the age of 3,'' Shimm says, ``your toddler will _ almost
miraculously _ adopt the social mores of the human race.''

 By KEN McALPINE  
 c.1998 Spirit magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We all know the real problem with eating a healthy diet: Bad
things taste good and good things taste bad, and it's no secret
where our inclinations lie.
</P>
<P>
   We all know that broccoli and spinach are nutritional manna, but
knowing that doesn't make them go down much more easily.
</P>
<P>
   That's what's so remarkable about fruit: It's good for you and
it tastes good. For some people, in fact, it's the source of all
culinary ecstasies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fruit in the microwave oven is phenomenal,'' says Nancy Clark.
``Core an apple, put in a dab of cinnamon, zap it in the microwave,
and you have this yummy-good baked apple. Bananas, peaches, really
any kind of fruit is good warmed. It's sort of like the inside of a
pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, director of nutrition services at Massachusetts
SportsMedicine Brookline and author of ``Nancy Clark's Sports
Nutrition Guidebook'' (Human Kinetics, 1997), has plenty of
innovative fruit favorites _ ``Frozen banana mixed with low-fat
milk in a blender tastes like the thickest, creamiest milkshake
around,'' she swears.
</P>
<P>
   Clark isn't the only nutritionist to volunteer fruit recipes.
One I talked to espoused smoothies _ throw ice, nonfat yogurt,
low-fat milk and your choice of fruit into a blender. Another
lauded fruit pizza _ instead of tomato sauce and fatty cheese, top
the pizza with yogurt and fruit. A third went for frozen banana
chunks _ ``Tastes just like candy!''
</P>
<P>
   This is a far cry from vegetables. All nutritionists want you to
eat them, but I've never had a nutritionist tell me, ``Have I got a
great recipe for Brussels sprouts!''
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, they can eat fruit with a clear conscience. Laced
with fiber, vitamins, minerals and fluid, virtually bereft of fat
and loaded with energy-rich carbohydrates, fruit is the next best
thing to the perfect food.
</P>
<P>
   ``No food will give you a magical edge,'' says Barry Swanson,
professor of food science and human nutrition at Washington State
University in Pullman. ``But fruit comes close.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, developed by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, recommend two to four servings of fruit a day for
adults _ which is roughly two to four servings more than many of us
eat.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, it's easy to add fruit to your diet, and you don't
need much. A banana at breakfast takes care of two fruit servings
right there.
</P>
<P>
   And the choices are legion: Bananas, oranges, strawberries,
cantaloupe and kiwi all supply potassium and vitamin C. Potassium
is a key nutrient in blood-pressure control, and vitamin C is
essential for connective-tissue repair and iron absorption.
</P>
<P>
   Apples, passion fruit and kumquats are loaded with fiber, shown
to lower the risk of intestinal cancer. Mangoes and papayas are
good sources of beta carotene, a vitamin-A cousin that can lower
the risk for certain cancers.
</P>
<P>
   The unjustly maligned avocado _ yep, it's a fruit _ has 60
percent more potassium than bananas, and its fat is mostly
monounsaturated, the type that's been shown to lower blood
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Variety ensures you get all these great nutrients,'' Swanson
says. ``Plus people get bored if they eat the same fruits all the
time. Variety sees to it that you keep eating fruit, which is what
you need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   How you eat the fruit is up to you, but Swanson recommends small
fruit snacks several times a day to keep your energy level up. It
will also help fill you up, making it easier to resist high-fat
midafternoon snacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using fruit as a substitute for fatty foods can really help
improve your health,'' Swanson says. ``And for most Americans the
big thing is getting away from fats.''
</P>
<P>
   A word of caution, however: Most fruit may be fat-free, but it
still has calories.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you need to do is substitute fruit for some of the other
things you're eating,'' Clark says. ``Instead of having two bowls
of cereal for breakfast, have one bowl and add a banana. If you add
fruit without adjusting the rest of your diet, you'll be adding
more calories.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't drop-kick breakfast for a glass of orange juice, either.
Most fruits are low in protein, essential vitamins and minerals
such as calcium, zinc and iron.
</P>
<P>
   So if you skip milk, you'll lose calcium. Skip the cereal, and
lose zinc and iron _ a shame, since the vitamin C in the orange
juice would help you absorb that iron better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fruit alone is not the magic cure for good health,'' Clark
says. ``It's still about balance.''
</P>
<P>
   For athletes, however, fruit can be close to magic, whether
they're push-it-to-the-limit pros or keeping-in-shape amateur
joggers, sports buffs or workout warriors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What athletes need most is energy, and fruits provide energy
quickly,'' Swanson says. ``The second-biggest problem for athletes
is dehydration, and fruit is filled with water. By eating fruit,
you're consuming the two things you really need.''
</P>
<P>
   Using fruit to your advantage _ before, during and after
exercise _ is easy.
</P>
<P>
   Along with water, Swanson recommends an apple or an orange 30
minutes before exercise. The thought of gobbling something solid
that close to a workout may make you squeamish, but the fiber in
the fruit can actually be an ally, holding in moisture your body
will need.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't bear the thought of solid food, Swanson says, drink
a glass of orange juice in addition to the water.
</P>
<P>
   Eating fruit during exercise is dicier. Fruit and the
carbohydrate they contain are broken down into glycogen, the body's
critical energy fuel _ but most workouts are too short to require
food of any kind during the workout.
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule your body has enough glycogen energy on hand
to keep you going for roughly 90 minutes. In fact, in exercise up
to an hour long, most sports nutritionists will tell you that water
is all you really need.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're going longer, or just feel the need for a little
carbohydrate-energy insurance, try fruit juice. There are plenty of
commercial sports drinks to pump carbohydrates into your system,
but Swanson considers fruit juice just as good. A 100-percent juice
is comparable to many commercial sports drinks, with its high sugar
content dumping energy right into your system.
</P>
<P>
   Because fruit juice is usually about 10 percent carbohydrates _
which is enough to compromise your absorption of water and possibly
upset your stomach _ you'll need to water down the juice, with
water outbalancing the juice.
</P>
<P>
   Because exercise drains your body of sugars and fluids, fruit
also is an ideal postworkout replenisher, a highly efficient
injection of carbohydrate and water at a time when your depleted
body readily absorbs them.
</P>
<P>
   And if solid food sounds unappetizing, the same answer prevails
_ go liquid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drink what you need,'' says Susan Luke, a Charlotte,
N.C.-based sports nutritionist. ``Fruit juice is a perfect way to
get the fluids back into you and also replace the carbohydrate
you've burned up during training.''
</P>
<P>
   Luke advises athletes to meet their postworkout needs and, to a
large extent, their daily fruit requirement by downing 16 to 32
ounces of orange juice after a hard workout.
</P>
<P>
   This might sound like a lot, Luke says, but because of their
greater energy needs, athletes need more fruit: The average female
athlete needs about 10 fruit servings a day, the average male
athlete 12 to 15. Drink 32 ounces of orange juice, and right there
you're getting about six servings of fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Athlete or not, getting fruit into your diet is mostly a matter
of eating it the way you like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fruit is terrific,'' Luke says, ``but it won't do you any good
unless you eat it. Did I tell you about my recipe for sunshine
salad? It's got pineapple juice, crushed pineapple, carrots ... ''

 &HT;    ALLIANCE BEGINS UPHILL BATTLE TO 'SAVE POLITICS FROM ITSELF'
 &HT;    By KEN FOSKETT
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new public interest campaign to end political
mudslinging opened here Monday with this cheery tidbit: Fewer than
one in 10 Americans follow news about candidates and elections very
closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, things don't look good for voter participation in
November,'' said Andrew Kohut, pollster for the Pew Research Center
for The People &AMP; The Press.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop of declining voter interest, the Alliance
for Better Campaigns officially launched a 10-state pilot program
to ``save politics from itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The group is urging television news directors to run regular,
five-minute candidate ``mini-debates'' on the issues and air pieces
that explain the truthfulness of political advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   It wants politicians to commit to a code of conduct in which
they pledge to abide by standards of honesty and accountability,
and to appear in their own television advertisements, which might
make some less willing to launch unsubstantiated attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to teach candidates to curtsey and bow,'' said
Rebecca Rimel, president of the Pew Charitable Trusts, which is
funding the Alliance's work. ``We want to see the candidates run
hard, fight hard ... and give the public an honest, fact-driven
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10 pilot states selected by the Alliance are Arizona,
California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota,
Oregon and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Previous efforts to improve campaign conduct have been mixed. In
Minnesota in 1996, the two Senate candidates were urged to avoid
false and misleading attacks, but voters nonetheless reported
perceiving a high level of negative attacks in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Faucheux, editor of Campaigns &AMP; Elections magazine, said the
Alliance's effort was a positive step because campaigns won't hold
themselves to higher standards. ``It has to be done by (outside)
moral assuagement,'' he said. ``It's not going to come from within
the political community. The incentive there is to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But a panel discussion among television news directors and two
political consultants staged for Monday's kickoff demonstrated the
gulf between the Alliance's lofty goals and the day-to-day business
of managing both television news and political campaigns. The
television news directors expressed frustration over making
political coverage relevant to viewers and getting candidates to
agree to debate one another.
</P>
<P>
   The two political consultants, one a Democrat and one a
Republican, said they were also frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Kam Kuwata, campaign manager for Rep. Jane Harman's failed bid
for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in California,
complained that the Harman campaign received virtually no
television coverage on the issues. He said consultants such as
himself increasingly had to rely on ``stunts'' such as staging a
pancake breakfast for reporters to charge that an opponent
flip-flops on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Douglass, a former California political reporter now with
ABC News, said it was a ``constant battle'' convincing news
directors to run issue stories. ``The assumption was that people
would change the channel,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Himstedt Riley, news director of WSFA-TV in Montgomery,
Ala., said her station had solved the problem of making politics
interesting by allowing voters to pose the questions to candidates
in this year's hotly contested gubernatorial race.
</P>
<P>
   The news directors said they frequently encountered problems
getting candidates to commit to debates, particularly if a
candidate is ahead in the polls. Both Kuwata and Dan Schnur, a GOP
consultant, acknowledged they would urge a candidate not to
participate in a debate if ahead in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Cochran, president of the Radio-Television News
Directors Association, was also cool the idea of free air time for
candidates, saying it simply allowed candidates to ``rehash
restated positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Taylor, executive director of the Alliance and a former
Washington Post reporter, left journalism two years ago to campaign
for more free television time for candidates. But he said he
learned a hard lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask a broadcaster for free air time, you earn his
wrath,'' he said. ``Air time is what he sells, not what he gives
away.''

A SUMMER OF DOUBLE AXELS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Sun Valley in the summer?'' several skiing friends asked
skeptically when I mentioned our vacation plans. ``What is there to
do in Sun Valley in the summer?'' More than enough, it turned out,
to fill two August weeks at the famous Idaho ski resort and leave
us wanting to come back.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking, white-water rafting, outdoor figure skating, relaxing in
natural springs hot enough to poach a salmon, sampling an array of
interesting restaurants and just taking in the colorful passing
scene somehow left us no time to make the Hemingway pilgrimage _
the author, a frequent visitor to the resort, lived in the adjacent
city of Ketchum, where he was buried after committing suicide in
1961.
</P>
<P>
   We could also have gone on a trail ride or on a ``take a llama
to lunch'' trek that uses llamas as pack animals, browsed the two
dozen art galleries, or attended the Sun Valley Summer Symphony's
free open-air concerts. Just more excuses for planning a return
visit.
</P>
<P>
   For our family, and specifically for our 12-year-old daughter,
Hannah, Sun Valley's lure was figure skating. The resort has
offered a summer skating program since it opened in 1936, and the
Sun Valley Skating School is now a mecca for skaters from all over
the country. They come for the chance to skate in a stunningly
beautiful setting and to learn from professionals with world-class
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   The two rinks, one indoors and one out under the blue mountain
sky, are open from early morning into the evening _ and without a
hockey player in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The skating attracts young and old. A few dozen New Yorkers, who
call themselves the Geriatric Figure Skating Club, have been
meeting at Sun Valley for years under the motto, ``Old figure
skaters never die, they just go to the big rink in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever they do, it works: They look great on the ice, and the
club's oldest active member is 89. The president, Leo Roberts,
offered me my favorite souvenir of the trip, a provisional
membership card and invitation to apply for full membership when I
get old enough.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some skating centers, where the casual public is barely
tolerated, Sun Valley offers public sessions throughout the day on
the outdoor rink, by far the more desirable of the two.
</P>
<P>
   A session lasting an hour and a half costs a reasonable $7.75.
As a lifelong but minimally competent skater, I almost didn't bring
my skates, afraid that the general skating level would be far
beyond me. But everyone is welcome, and there were plenty of
first-timers stumbling around, as well as veterans showing off
their footwork. The fresh air and friendly atmosphere were
addictive, and my husband, Gene Fidell, and I were inspired to take
a few lessons from Sherry Winder, a pro with the requisite patience
and sense of humor to take us on.
</P>
<P>
   The skating school itself, by contrast, is not for dilettantes.
We planned our time in Sun Valley to coordinate with a half-dozen
other families from our local rink in Rockville, Md., and with
Hannah's coach, Alice Shelley. So Hannah and her friends skated
four to five hours a day, taking classes like ``The Art of the
Edge'' and individual lessons from professionals, including Linda
Fratianne, the Olympic silver medalist, and Judy Blumberg, a
five-time national ice dance champion.
</P>
<P>
   These practice sessions are scheduled throughout the day for
various types and levels of skating. The 50-minute sessions must be
reserved in weeklong blocks and prepaid. Arrangements with the
various pros are usually made well in advance from a list the
school provides.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared, however, that anyone who was eligible to skate
during a given hour could almost always find a pro to give a
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers were challenging but supportive, and the girls
ended their long days tired but eager for more. The charges for ice
time and lesson fees _ up to $40 for a private 25-minute lesson _
are comparable to those at many more ordinary rinks, but it is easy
to spend $100 or more a day when you start counting by the hour.
</P>
<P>
   While skating was the main event for us, it is only a colorful
curiosity to most of Sun Valley's visitors, who come for the
hiking, fly-fishing, golf or other outdoor activities. For the
casual passer-by, there are several enjoyable ways to take in the
skating scene without actually getting on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious one is the weekly Saturday night figure-skating
show, which not only showcases the resident talent but brings in a
different world-famous skater for a starring role every week. Nancy
Kerrigan, the 1994 Olympic silver medalist, was the headline
performer we saw.
</P>
<P>
   The show is on the outdoor rink. Buy reserved seats from the
resort's sports center and bring a blanket _ at 6,000 feet,
temperatures plunge once the sun goes down, and the metal bleachers
are excellent conductors of the nighttime chill. No one warned us
about this, and by the end of the show, I felt as if I had wandered
into a late-season football game.

 Includes a color slide of Phil Hartman in a scene from
``Newsradio.'' 
 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.1998 Canadian TV Guide  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phil Hartman was one of the funniest guys around, but that's
only part of the reason why his sudden departure is so tragic.
</P>
<P>
   What makes it even worse is the fact that Hartman's death _ at
his own wife's hand, in a bizarre murder/suicide on May 28 _ came
at the worst possible time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   At 49, Hartman was enjoying professional peaks in many areas: He
was a lead character on a hit sitcom, ``Newsradio.'' He was also
part of the recurring voice ensemble on ``The Simpsons,'' he had
already wrapped a key role in the ambitious film ``Small Soldiers''
and he regularly lent his comic presence as a commercial pitchman
for products ranging from fast-food chains to phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   For a comic actor who had labored hard for more than a decade,
working his way from thankless bit parts on ``Saturday Night Live''
to small supporting roles in movies, everything was suddenly coming
together for Hartman.
</P>
<P>
   Then it all came to an abrupt end.
</P>
<P>
   I had the good fortune to interview Hartman on four occasions
over the years, and I can honestly say that he was every bit as
funny in person as he was on television.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first times we talked was on the telephone, in
connection with his role in the 1992 comedy ``Coneheads,'' in which
he played the pointy-headed alien leader. The comedian was calling
from a hotel near the location of his next film, the comedy ``House
Guest,'' co-starring Sinbad.
</P>
<P>
   Early in our telephone chat, Hartman broke away to politely ask
a room-service waiter to leave his lunch on the table. Hearing him
do so in that trademark Hartman unctuous voice, I immediately broke
into laughter.
</P>
<P>
   When the comedian came back on the line, he asked me what was so
funny, and I told him that it was hilarious to hear him say
something normal in his distinctive voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get that a lot,'' he cracked.
</P>
<P>
   In that same conversation, Hartman waxed eloquent about his
memories of a Canadian boyhood in Brantford, Ont., a town best
known as the birthplace of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hartman's family departed Brantford while he was quite
young, and he was subsequently reared in Connecticut and Los
Angeles, he still recalled the small town fondly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just remember Brantford as being this peaceful place, with
acres of trees and farmland and beautiful scenery,'' Hartman said.
``It was actually very inspiring for me _ it's probably why I later
went into art.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartman's artistic bent took him to California State University
in Los Angeles, where he studied graphic design and later, in the
early 1970s, achieved renown as the designer of record-album
jackets, including ones for The Eagles, America and Poco.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman had always enjoyed entertaining people, but didn't begin
to think of it as a possible career until 1975, when he joined the
Los Angeles-based improv group The Groundlings, working with
up-and-coming comics including Paul Reubens, later better known as
Pee-Wee Herman.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman was hooked immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discovered I could make people laugh, really laugh,'' he
recalled, ``and I wanted more.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``more'' took shape in 1986, when he joined ``Saturday
Night Live'' as a full-time cast member.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, he became known as the man of a
thousand comic faces _ his ability to mimic voice and facial
patterns was astounding. Hartman's repertoire of impressions ran
the gamut: Ed McMahon, Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Swaggart, Phil Donahue,
Ted Kennedy and Bill Clinton, to name but a few.
</P>
<P>
   He also created his own inimitable characters, including the
Anal-Retentive Chef, who spent most of his time wrapping leftover
food neatly and precisely in cling-wrap, and the Unfrozen Caveman
Lawyer, a Cro-Magnon attorney who was frightened by all things
modern.
</P>
<P>
   I talked with Hartman on another occasion, this time in person,
during his ``SNL'' years. The most ingratiating thing about his
personality, I found, was that he truly had no desire to be the
show's big star.
</P>
<P>
   During his ``SNL'' period _ from 1986 to 1994 _ Hartman shared
the stage with big talent: Dana Carvey, Mike Myers, Dennis Miller,
Chris Farley and others. Among this lineup of comic all-stars,
however, he preferred to think of himself as a supporting player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like the glue that kind of holds the show together,'' he
said. ``That's why I usually play characters that are within the
range of believability.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartman maintained that believability when he left ``SNL'' to
star in the NBC sitcom ``Newsradio.'' His character, smarmy news
anchor Bill MacNeil, was tailor-made for Hartman, who loved the
idea of working with a large ensemble cast.
</P>
<P>
   My fondest, most lasting memory of Phil Hartman came only a few
months ago, during media day on the ``Newsradio'' set.
</P>
<P>
   The entire cast of eight regulars was assigned to field
questions and promote the show. It was clear, however, that Hartman
was the show's esteemed elder statesman. Not only were most of the
questions directed to him, but also most of his fellow performers
looked to him for guidance in their answers.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, co-star Maura Tierney was struggling to find words
to explain the show's success, and Hartman helped her out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, well, we're an ensemble show in the truest sense of the
word,'' he purred in that radio-intoned voice. ``I guess we're
somewhat in the tradition of `Cheers' and `Taxi,' where there
really is no dominant star. But on this show, the star is me ...
But seriously, everybody on this show is capable of going out and
knocking one out of the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartman kept that same approach throughout the hour-long
interview session, gently reminding reporters of movie projects his
co-stars were currently working on.
</P>
<P>
   But the most telling moment came when someone asked Hartman to
compare his ``NewsRadio'' experience with his old days on
``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's better about doing this show is that there's more of a
team spirit and we're all very close,'' Hartman said thoughtfully.
``On `SNL' there was a competitive atmosphere conducive to cliques
and rivalries and backstabbing. It was a more difficult situation
to endure emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very close-knit team, and I'm very, very happy.''

DONNY OSMOND BOUNCES BACK

 Includes a color slide of Donny Osmond during the making of
``Mulan.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``Donny'' just doesn't seem to make it.
 &HT;    He's 40 now, and the father of five sons. How about ``Don?''
``Donald?'' ``Mr. Osmond?'' At least ``The Donny?''
 &HT;    ``Just call me Donny,'' the one-time teen idol and the lead half
of ``Donny and Marie'' says. ``I'll be Donny until I'm 90.''
 &HT;    It's 10 a.m. in a Honolulu hotel. It's early, but not too early
for Osmond to have had breakfast with his family, gotten in some
scuba diving and now started thinking aloud about the new talk show
he and his sister have coming up in the fall _ predictably, it's
called ``The Donny and Marie Show.''
 &HT;    Osmond has a vision, and it's of rapper Sean ``Puffy'' Combs.
No, really, he's serious.
 &HT;    ``I'd love to have Puff Daddy come on,'' Osmond says. ``I want
to sing one of Puffy's songs with him.''
 &HT;    Obviously, this isn't your father's ``Donny and Marie.'' They
won't be wearing bell bottoms, and don't expect Perry Como to show
up. Osmond is thinking of Sean Connery and Harrison Ford. His
sister wants to interview Pee Wee Herman.
 &HT;    ``It's not going to be nice and sweet,'' he promises. ``It won't
be Marie going, `Oh, you're such a great brother.' We want to
surprise people.''
 &HT;    There are limits, of course. Don't expect a tag-team version of
``The Jerry Springer Show.''
 &HT;    ``We don't want to bash and expose _ least of all each other,''
Osmond says, laughing. ``We want to do what we call entertainment
talk.''
 &HT;    The show will begin taping in July for a September debut. Until
then, though, Osmond will be heard _ though not seen _ in Disney's
lush new animated film ``Mulan,'' opening June 19.
 &HT;    His role as the singing voice of the warrior Shang _ the
speaking scenes are voiced by B.D. Wong _ realizes a standing
ambition of Osmond's. He'd actually auditioned for the speaking
voice of Hercules last year, but lost out. Only after the ``Mulan''
casting director saw him onstage in the Webber-Rice musical
``Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat'' did Osmond get his
shot at animated stardom.
 &HT;    This is real stardom, too _ at least if you ask the singer's
sons, ages newborn to 19.
 &HT;    ``One of my little boys said to me, `Now that you've done a
Disney film, you're a real star, Dad,'' Osmond says.
 &HT;    An older generation already knew that, of course. The old
version of ``The Donny and Marie Show'' debuted in 1976 and ran
until 1979.
 &HT;    ``We're the people you grew up with and who visited your living
room in the '70s,'' Osmond says. ``Marie and I think, for our
audience, it will be like old friends getting back together.''
 &HT;    Those days are long gone, but Osmond has a sense of humor about
them.
 &HT;    ``I think the highlight of my young career was when a girl told
me her parents used `The Donny and Marie Show' as a potty-training
tool,'' he says with a laugh. ``If she wet her pants, she couldn't
watch the show.''
 &HT;    At the time, the Osmonds enjoyed a squeaky-clean image, whether
on television or on the concert stage. Today, though, Osmond is
willing to concede that the reality was a bit less pristine.
 &HT;    ``I had this little system down,'' he recalls. ``Marie would
help pick out the cute girls in the audience, and our road manager
would give them backstage passes.''
 &HT;    But times have changed, he hastens to add: ``At 20, I met my
wife, and those shenanigans were over.''
 &HT;    In the old days, he admits, fame sometimes went to his head.
 &HT;    ``Once Lucille Ball was guesting on our show,'' he recalls,
``and I told her she was singing flat. I was like, `Could you do
that one more time, babe?' Now I look back on that incident and
cringe.''
 &HT;    When the show ended, Osmond went his separate way. He recorded
several solo albums, including the Top-20 hit ``Soldier of Love.''
 &HT;    ``It was funny,'' he recalls. ``DJs would play the single and
then, weeks later, they would announce it was me in amazement. They
didn't think it could possibly be me, because they liked the song
so much. They couldn't believe that it was cool to be listening to
Donny Osmond again.''
 &HT;    He enjoyed being apart from the ``Donny and Marie'' vibe, he
says.
 &HT;    ``It was nice for us to be able to separate,'' he says. ``We
wanted to do our own things. You don't want to feel like you're
half of an act. Sometimes you just want to prove that you can do it
on your own.''
 &HT;    Now they're ready to reteam, but they're 20 years older. Things
won't be the way they were, Osmond says, but that's not necessarily
bad.
 &HT;    ``Over the years since our first show, our relationship wasn't
as close,'' he says. ``We got married, we had children. We had our
own lives. We would only see each other at holidays.''
 &HT;    The spur to reunite was a joint appearance on ``The Rosie
O'Donnell Show.'' It arose from an earlier visit in which Osmond,
appearing without his sister, had made fun of O'Donnell's weight
during a conversation about air travel.
 &HT;    ``I didn't think a helicopter could handle that much weight,''
he said _ incurring the audience's wrath and making himself a
running target of derision on the show for weeks to come.
 &HT;    Months later, Marie Osmond called her brother and told him she
was going on ``Rosie.'' Maybe he'd like to come along and
apologize, she suggested.
 &HT;    ``Believe me, before that I made calls and wrote letters. I
apologized profusely to Rosie,'' Osmond insists.
 &HT;    The joint appearance was nightmarish, the singer says.
 &HT;    ``During Marie's first segment,'' he recalls, ``I was in the
green room, and my sister tells Rosie how I'd rib her about being
fat when she was little. I was like, `Marie, shut up!'''
 &HT;    Then Osmond took the stage, bearing a big bouquet of flowers.
 &HT;    ``People started to throw things at me,'' he says. ``Every time
I would try to speak, Rosie would hit a button and my line about
her weight was broadcast.''
 &HT;    When Osmond agreed to sing one of his old hits with her,
O'Donnell had another surprise _ a puppy-dog costume.
 &HT;    ``I had no choice but put it on,'' Osmond recalls, wincing.
``Marie gave me no support. Marie even said, `Down on one knee.'''
 &HT;    Cowering, Osmond crooned ``Puppy Love'' and earned O'Donnell's
pardon.
 &HT;    ``It was the most humiliating moment in my entire life,'' he
says.
 &HT;    But the audience loved it. The ratings were the series'
third-highest ever, trailing only visits from Tom Cruise and Barbra
Streisand. Producer/host Dick Clark caught it, and pitched the
Osmonds on a return to television.
 &HT;    Part of his reason for agreeing, Osmond jokes, was that
O'Donnell agreed to repay their visit.
 &HT;    ``I asked Rosie to come on and she said yes,'' he says with a
mock-sinister chuckle. ``I do want some vindication for the puppy
suit. Believe me, all my friends are thinking.''
 &HT;    He may have been onstage for 35 of his 40 years, but Osmond
admits to a combination of nervousness and nostalgia as he and his
sister try to rekindle the old magic.
 &HT;    ``When we did the pilot, Marie was in her dressing room,'' he
recalls. ``I walked by, and she was sitting there chewing on her
fingernails. It was just like the old days.
 &HT;    ``I looked at Marie and said, `Are you nervous?''' he adds.
``She said, `I'm half scared to death.'
 &HT;    ``I said, `Me, too.'''

 &HT;    ``That seemed like such a perfect combination for me,'' she
says. ``In the 1970s, I was always networking with other women I
knew. The idea was to help each other, introduce each other to
other people.
 &HT;    ``Anyway, I found an old networking notebook I had, from 1976,
that said I wanted to direct movies,'' Thomas recalls. ``I had a
five-year plan, and the movies I'd direct would have to do with
dolphins. I guess I thought it would be the ultimate thing for
me.''
 &HT;    Thomas chuckles.
 &HT;    ``By then I'd acted and painted,'' she says. ``I'd written
little things and directed improv groups. I felt I should be the
person who said, `Here's what should happen.'''
 &HT;    That she is, but the art houses are still waiting. Thomas, the
boisterous, quick-to-laugh former star of television's ``Hill
Street Blues,'' made her name as a director with HBO's series
``Dream On,'' the acclaimed cable movie ``The Late Shift'' (1996)
and two dolphin-free features, ``The Brady Bunch Movie'' (1995) and
``Private Parts'' (1997), the latter starring Howard Stern.
 &HT;    She gets a little closer to ``Flipper'' with her latest film,
``Dr. Dolittle,'' opening June 26, with a cast that includes Eddie
Murphy and a whole lot of animals.
 &HT;    A remake of the lame 1967 Rex Harrison fantasy/musical might not
seem initially promising, but for the director Murphy made all the
difference.
 &HT;    ``I wouldn't have been interested in `Dolittle' if it weren't
for Eddie,'' she admits. ``I knew the film would be nothing like
the original if we had Eddie. I knew the film would have an edge if
we had Eddie.
 &HT;    ``And, hey, any director who wants to do comedy wants to work
with Eddie Murphy.''
 &HT;    Her biggest challenge, she says, was to get Murphy, who despises
every creature in the animal kingdom, into the same frame as the
assorted dogs, llamas, rats and tigers that share the life of Dr.
John Dolittle.
 &HT;    ``Eddie doesn't have a hell of a lot of experience with animals
in his life,'' Thomas says.
 &HT;    ``Our first week he brought in a tape of `When Animals
Attack,''' she recalls. ``Eddie insisted I see the tape, and on it
there was a kitty cat, up for adoption, that attacked this guy.
 &HT;    ``Eddie's screaming, `See! See! Anything can attack!'
 &HT;    ``After that I had to talk him into everything he did,'' she
says, laughing. ``But he did everything I asked.
 &HT;    ``Eddie brings lots of intuitive comedy to any film he does,''
the director adds more seriously. ``So you give him the basic scene
and he goes from there, coming up with ideas and jokes that just
weren't there on paper. That's what I hoped he'd do.''
 &HT;    Murphy wasn't the only improvisation-happy comic on the set.
Norm Macdonald and Chris Rock provided the voices of a dog and
guinea pig, respectively. Their freewheeling creativity only
further complicated Thomas' dealings with moody animals and the 300
intricate, computer-generated images that were employed to convince
moviegoers that the various creatures were chatting away.
 &HT;    ``I didn't record the dialogue beforehand and stick with every
line,'' she says. ``I kept changing things over and over and over
until it got funnier. I couldn't let the improv instincts of these
great comedians be blocked, so I think I made it a nightmare for
the special-effects people. But that's the way it had to be.''
 &HT;    The resulting film is a strange movie that defies easy
description, its director says.
 &HT;    ``I don't know what it is,'' she says, laughing. ``Is it a
family film? Is it a kids' movie?
 &HT;    ``I made `Brady Bunch' for 30-year-olds, and 14-year-olds went
five and six times,'' she recalls. ```Dolittle' is not the same,
but it's that kind of a movie.
 &HT;    ``It's a great, teen-ager-hip movie,'' Thomas says. ``You get an
idea of the movie's tone from having Eddie in there, and from
having Chris and Norm as our largest animals. Then you throw Albert
Brooks in there, too.
 &HT;    ``It's not a kids' movie,'' she says, ``but younger kids are
thrilled to like a movie their older brother or sister likes.''
 &HT;    Thomas sighs.
 &HT;    ``It's better than I thought it could be,'' she says. ``I don't
know that I've said that about one of my movies. It's an Eddie
Murphy movie, and there's enough of the way I do movies to make it
sort of my kind of movie, too. I'm pleased.''
 &HT;    It's no wonder that Thomas is pleased. She's one of only three
women to direct a picture that's earned more than $60 million. Her
production company, Tall Trees, green-lighted the hit teen film,
``Can't Hardly Wait,'' and Thomas is a self-described ``in-demand''
director considering three projects for her next effort.
 &HT;    Don't call her a woman director, though. Thomas resolutely
refuses to carry any sort of a banner for other female filmmakers,
or to make movies that speak for women as such.
 &HT;    ``I don't, I can't,'' says Thomas, who lives in Hollywood and is
``old enough to know better than to give my age.''
 &HT;    ``I do feel pressure to make movies that make some statement,''
she admits. ``I feel personal pressure to make films that are
revealing of me as a human being.''
 &HT;    Those revelations aren't necessary direct, she adds. Thomas
compares the process of making a film to that of painting.
 &HT;    ``You take 114 pages of white paper with some typing on them,
typing which is sometimes good and sometimes not so good,'' she
says, ``and you try to whip it together with the help of hundreds
of people doing hundreds of things.
 &HT;    ``I was an art student at college,'' she says. ``I'd have this
white canvas and had to end up with a painting. Film is similar,
but different: You're starting with some other person's vision,
which is the script, and you have to take it and make it your
vision while realizing it's a collaborative process.
 &HT;    ``Also,'' she adds, ``you can do a painting pretty quickly,
whereas a film can take a year, a year-and-a-half of your life. You
really have to love making films to do this job, and you have to
love the film you're doing to do it well.''
 &HT;    After a very busy last couple of years, Thomas admits that she'd
love to be able to take a break. But momentum in a directing career
is a fragile thing, and she's afraid to slow down while she's still
on a roll.
 &HT;    Which means that pining ``Hill Street'' fans who'd like to see
her acting again will have to wait.
 &HT;    ``You know what I'm thinking?'' she says. ``I want to retire
from directing in about 10 years, and for the last five years of my
working life I want to be the next-door neighbor on some very easy
sitcom.
 &HT;    ``Maybe I'll be like that neighbor whose face you never see on
`Home Improvement,''' she jokes. ``That would be perfect.
 &HT;    ``Then I'll retire and, hopefully, people will remember me as
both a director and an actor. That's what I'm thinking.''

 Includes a color slide of the character Mulan on horseback in a
scene from ``Mulan.'' 
 By JEANNE WOLF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since she first reduced audiences to sobs in ``The Joy Luck
Club'' (1993), Ming-Na Wen has built a blossoming Hollywood career
on unexpected choices.
</P>
<P>
   She went from that wrenching drama to the chop-and-sock action
flicks ``Hong Kong 97'' (1993) and ``The Streetfighter'' (1994),
starred as the acerbic Trudy in the television sitcom ``The Single
Girl'' and then shocked her fans _ and her parents _ by revealing
much more than her acting talent in a steamy love scene with Wesley
Snipes in ``One Night Stand'' (1997).
</P>
<P>
   Now she's tackling a cartoon epic in Disney's animated feature
``Mulan,'' opening June 19. Wen voices the title character, a girl
in ancient China who masquerades as a man to join the war against
invading Huns. Eddie Murphy and B.D. Wong provide other voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mulan'' is a dream come true for the 30-year-old, Hong
Kong-born actress, who was raised in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a little girl my mother first told me the story,
which is an enduring Chinese legend,'' Wen says. ``It made a big
impression on me. I think a lot of Asian girls identify with Mulan
because she's so courageous and conquers every obstacle placed in
her way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was also a Disney maniac,'' she adds. ``I loved all their
animated movies. I wanted all my vacations to be at Disney World.
I've been there about seven times, and I know every ride. So I
guess you can imagine how I felt when I found out they wanted me to
star in `Mulan.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wen also appreciates the fact that ``Mulan'' is the first Disney
animated feature to star a largely Asian cast, and that its story
will shatter some stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this weird misconception about Chinese women _ that
we're submissive,'' the actress says with a sigh. ``Actually, it's
a very matriarchal society. You should meet my mom. We call her
`the boss lady.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, Mulan breaks out of the Cinderella complex,'' she adds.
``She saves the guy, she saves China and she does it all by
believing in herself and following her heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Wen's work on ``Mulan,'' which spanned several years, took on
added resonance after the sudden death of her father midway through
production. Mulan undertakes her masquerade to save her own ailing
father from being drafted into the war against the Huns.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's willing to sacrifice her own life to protect him,'' the
actress says. ``I identified with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The man she calls her father was actually her stepfather, Wen
adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no memory of my real father, who abandoned us in Hong
Kong when I was a baby,'' she says. ``Without my stepfather, I
don't think I'd be living my version of the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he passed away during production just
intensified the connection I felt with Mulan,'' Wen says. ``When my
mom and I watched the film we were both thinking of my dad. We
ended up bawling through most of the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Wen had to struggle with her own Asian identity as a child in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken me a long while to embrace my own culture and love
who I am,'' she admits. ``I remember I was thinking of taking an
American name. In addition to Disney films, I liked to watch reruns
of old classic movies starring Doris Day and Ann-Margret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be called Maggie or Doris. Can you imagine? Maggie
Wen.''
</P>
<P>
   Wen's teen-age years were defined by her father's Chinese
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was cleaning tables when I was 13,'' she recalls, ``and I
was seriously waitressing by the time I was 16. It wasn't easy, but
I think it gave me a good business sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my friends when I was growing up were cooks and
busboys,'' she explains. ``They all worked hard, and some of that
work ethic rubbed off on me. It helped me keep my self-esteem and
my focus when I had to face the biz side of show biz.''
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Wen says, she had a rebellious streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember once I was waiting on this huge party,'' she says.
``I think there were 12 of them. They were being very obnoxious. At
the end of the meal, I came to the table, and they had each left a
penny next to their plates. That was their little joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so offended,'' she recalls. ``I felt it was just a
reflection of the fact that they didn't think the Chinese were
really people. So I picked up every one of the pennies and went
charging off to the cash register where they were paying the check.
</P>
<P>
   ``I practically threw the pennies down and said, `You know what?
I don't need this insult. As far as I'm concerned, you can choke on
your pennies!'''
</P>
<P>
   Wen moved on to study dramatic arts at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh. After graduation, she headed for New
York, where she soon landed a role as a 16-year-old Vietnamese
refugee on the CBS soap opera ``As The World Turns.''
</P>
<P>
   The young actress went on to a variety of theater roles before
``The Joy Luck Club,'' which brought her back to China for filming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time I'd been there since we left when I was
a toddler,'' she says. ``I took my mother along. It was an
incredible experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Wen's first marriage, to actor/writer Kirk Aanes, ended in
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was young and in love,'' she says. ``I discovered too late
that we were both in show business and there was constant
competition. Every time I got a job I had to console him. That took
its toll.''
</P>
<P>
   Their breakup made Wen admittedly ``gun-shy,'' but nevertheless
when she married again, three years ago, it was to another
actor/writer _ Eric Zee, who played Dr. Peter Chow on ``Dr. Quinn,
Medicine Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Before they were married, Wen produced Zee's play, ``Exit the
Dragon,'' which dealt with the downside of being an Asian actor in
a white show-business world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Eric had to write the play to come to terms with the
prejudice he faced as an actor,'' she says. ``It's about three
Chinese men who are struggling to make it in show business and the
stereotypical roles they're forced to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Wen hastens to add that the problems of her first marriage have
not resurfaced in her second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not competitive,'' she says. ``Eric wants to celebrate
my success. He's the most loving person.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing, because Wen is experiencing a lot of success
lately, including her Broadway debut in David Hwang's recently
closed ``Golden Child.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being on the Broadway stage was like living out one more
dream,'' she says. ``I feel like I'm the luckiest girl alive.''
</P>
<P>
   That success may have been foreshadowed shortly after she was
born, she adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese people read faces,'' she explains. ``They look at
the shape of your eyebrows, your nose, your lips. The amazing thing
is that it seems to be quite accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, my mother looked at my face when I was a baby,'' she
says. ``My nose, the bridge of my nose, shoots toward the sky. It's
very high for a Chinese person. It meant that I was destined to be
in the arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother didn't think that would be a good profession for
me,'' she adds with a laugh. ``So for years she did everything she
could to dissuade me from being an actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I'm successful, she takes all the credit,'' Wen adds.
``Not only that, she gives me acting tips all the time.''

 UNDATED: football game.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another way to watch the skating is to eat lunch at the patio
restaurant of the Sun Valley Lodge, the resort's 500-room
centerpiece. The patio overlooks the outdoor rink, where a special
lunch-hour practice session is set aside for the pros. It was
thrilling, as well as instructive, to watch these top-level skaters
working the kinks out of their programs, coaxing breathtaking
triple jumps out of sometimes uncooperative bodies.
</P>
<P>
   And anyone can simply take a seat in the bleachers and watch a
class. Several times a week, Gia Guddat, the artistic director of
the ice show, and Gary Beacom, a top professional whose offbeat
routines have made him a television favorite, led a morning clinic
on the outdoor rink consisting of exercises of increasingly
daunting intricacy against a musical background.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Guddat was usually draped in the gloriously retro tie-dyed
outfits she designs and sells in the Skyntytes Factory in downtown
Ketchum. Beacom, by contrast, was a kind of skating Everyman,
dressed in khaki shorts, a white sport shirt and sunglasses.
Together, they made a visually arresting pair of Pied Pipers for
the two dozen skaters who tried gamely to imitate their moves.
</P>
<P>
   (As it happens, Beacom is unavailable to perform this summer; he
is serving a federal prison sentence for income tax fraud.)
</P>
<P>
   In winter, Sun Valley is only for skiing (the outdoor rink stays
open, but staff members told me that there are rarely more than 10
skaters on it). In the summer, Sun Valley serves two purposes: as a
full-service resort destination, and as a jumping-off point for
various wilderness activities in the surrounding mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Valley is in the Wood River Valley in south-central Idaho,
and sits at the entrance to the Sawtooth National Recreation Area,
a 756,000-acre preserve managed by the United States Forest
Service. The recreation area marked its 25th anniversary during our
stay. There are many hiking trails of varying difficulty, all
offering heart-stopping views of the surrounding high peaks.
</P>
<P>
   We spent a late afternoon on an ``easy'' three-mile hike from a
trail head close to the Galena Mountain pass on state Route 75, 28
miles north of Sun Valley. The trail climbed 480 feet to a
9,120-foot peak and led us past alpine meadows to the tiny
emerald-green Titus Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Of the mountain ranges in the area, my favorite by far was the
Sawtooth Mountains, surely one of the most aptly named. With their
sharp side-by-side peaks, they look just like a saw laid on its
side, almost cartoonlike in their one-dimensional perfection. Ask a
kindergartner to draw mountains and you will get the Sawtooth
(Sawteeth?).
</P>
<P>
   The real gateway to the wilderness area is Stanley, a frontier
town about 65 miles north of Sun Valley on Route 75. Raft trips on
the main branch of the Salmon River begin there, with several
outfitters competing for the business.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles outside Stanley is the Redfish Lake Lodge, a
pleasantly rustic hotel, open only in summer, that makes a nice
contrast to the more refined charms of Sun Valley. Redfish Lake
itself offers boating, swimming, hiking and horseback riding.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to Stanley, about 24 miles from Ketchum on Route 75,
is Galena Lodge, a community center and restaurant. It has no
overnight accommodations, but offers a variety of activities,
including a nature adventure day camp for children and a weekly
guided wildflower walk.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers were past their peak by mid-August, but the walk was
still delightful. The lodge's homemade breads and soups are also
worth the drive.
</P>
<P>
   Our half-day of white-water rafting turned into an interesting
natural history lesson as well as a bracing adventure. The
endangered chinook salmon had just started to spawn in the Salmon
River, which under federal regulations required a half-mile portage
around the spawning site.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was made more than worthwhile by the sight of a
female salmon sitting on her nest in the middle of the shallow
river, waiting to complete an amazing life cycle that had brought
her on a 1,600-mile round trip through the dams on the Columbia
River and out to the Pacific Ocean and back. Only 0.1 of 1 percent
of the salmon spawned in the Salmon River make it back, with most
dying on the outward journey.
</P>
<P>
   We felt privileged to have glimpsed one of the precious few. The
chance to go down the Salmon at all may become increasingly rare:
the Forest Service has recently proposed sharp restrictions on the
number of rafters who will be allowed on the river, beginning next
year.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of all this nature, the Sun Valley resort itself is
completely man made. Averell Harriman, then the chairman of the
Union Pacific Railroad, built it in 1936 on empty ranch land
outside the old mining town of Ketchum. His twin goals were to
emulate the ski resorts he enjoyed in the Alps and to give people a
reason to ride a little-used rail route.

<P>
   For a hint of Sun Valley in the winter, take the chairlift up to
the restaurant at 9,010 feet on Bald Mountain, the resort's main
ski mountain. The views are spectacular and the winds brisk.
</P>
<P>
   The resort has two hotels, the Lodge and the slightly
lower-priced Sun Valley Inn, as well as several condominium
communities, where apartments can be rented either directly through
the resort or through local real estate companies. Our
well-furnished two-bedroom, two-bath apartment in the Snowcreek
development cost $1,100 a week and had the advantage of being an
easy walk to the rink.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sun Valley and Ketchum are separately incorporated
municipalities, they essentially function as one place; a free
shuttle bus connects the two. Ketchum offers interest and amenities
on a scale well beyond its year-round population of 3,280,
including an impressive community library with more than 65,000
books.

 UNDATED: 65,000 books.

<P>
   Ketchum's downtown, no more than about 10 square blocks, is
lined with restaurants, shops and real estate agencies. ``They used
to take gold bullion out of here, and now they're busy bringing it
back,'' my husband said.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the area's delights (including our favorite shop,
Iconoclast Used Books, an old house at 100 First Avenue that had
books packed into every room, including science fiction and humor
collections in the bathroom), it was still the skating that made
our vacation special. One morning, I looked up from navigating my
way around the rink to find Nancy Kerrigan, dressed in shorts and a
sweatshirt, standing off to the side quietly watching the skaters.
</P>
<P>
   In a few minutes, people would recognize her and young girls
would flock for her autograph. But meanwhile, it was possible to
indulge in the momentary fantasy that Nancy Kerrigan was actually
watching me skate.
</P>
<P>
   And it occurred to me: There are any number of places in the
world where you can watch an Olympic champion skate, but in how
many other places could you look up and find one watching you? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: Sun Valley is not really near any major city. We
flew into Salt Lake City, rented a car and drove the nearly 300
miles in about five and a half hours. This drive offers mountain
desert scenery, and a stop at Shoshone Falls on the Snake River in
Twin Falls, Idaho, a spectacular waterfall that is higher than
Niagara.
</P>
<P>
   Another gateway is Boise, about three hours away. A van service
started up a few months ago, making one round trip a day between
the Boise Airport and Sun Valley for $49 each way. Call Sun Valley
Express, (800) 634-6539. There are also commuter flights from Salt
Lake City to Hailey, Idaho, about 10 miles from Sun Valley.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO STAY: You can book all resort accommodations through
the Sun Valley Resort, (800) 786-8259. Summer rates at Sun Valley
Inn range from $114 a night for a standard room to $399 for a
three-bedroom apartment. At the larger Sun Valley Lodge, rates are
$139 to $379. No meals are included.
</P>
<P>
   We had a well-furnished, two-bedroom apartment in the resort's
Snow Creek condominium, a short walk from the rink. Rates there and
at Cottonwood, across the street from the rink, start at $209 a
night; no weekly discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Several real estate agencies represent owners of individual
condominiums. The Sun Valley-Ketchum Chamber of Commerce, P.O. Box
2420, Sun Valley, Idaho 83353, keeps a list of rental agents, and
has information about nightly accommodations in Ketchum. Call (800)
634-3347, or see www.visit sunvalley.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Valley Resort maintains a web site, www.sunvalley.com,
and I found useful, information at a commercial site unaffiliated
with the resort, www.svguide.com.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO EAT: Have lunch at Sun Valley Lodge's patio restaurant,
Gretchen's, and enjoy the view of the outdoor rink, especially late
in the week, when the pros practice their routines for the Saturday
show. Open 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Lunch for two with a glass of wine is
about $25; (208) 622-2144.
</P>
<P>
   People go for the steaks and the scene to the Pioneer Saloon,
308 North Main Street, (208) 726-3139, which we found a bit
overwhelmed by its own popularity. Dinner for two with a drink:
about $40.
</P>
<P>
   We had elegant meals at Evergreen Bistro, First Avenue and River
Street, which is open nightly from 6:30. Game dishes are a
specialty, with dinner for two with wine costing about $100; (208)
726-3888.
</P>
<P>
   The list of good Mexican restaurants includes Desperado's,
Fourth Avenue and Washington Street. Dinner entrees run $6 to $9.
Lunch and dinner; (208) 726-3068.
</P>
<P>
   At the Buffalo Cafe, 320 East Avenue E, (208) 726-9795, I had a
_ what else? _ buffalo burger ($7) under the baleful eye of a
mounted buffalo head.
</P>
<P>
   We would gladly return to Chapala, a Mexican place at 502 North
Main Street, Hailey. Open daily 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.; entrees are
$3.99 to 12.50; (208) 788-5065.
</P>
<P>
   North of Ketchum on Route 75, Galena Lodge has an inviting menu,
featuring lamb, beef and salmon. The restaurant is open for lunch
Monday through Saturday, dinner Thursday through Saturday, and
Sunday brunch. Dinner for two with wine is about $45; (208)
726-4010.
</P>
<P>
   FIGURE SKATING: Call the Sun Valley Skating Center, (208)
622-2192, for the school's brochure and reservation form. Ice time
for all 50-minute practice sessions and lessons must be reserved in
weeklong blocks and payment made with the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   The cost is up to $40 for a private 25-minute lesson. Public
sessions last an hour and a half and cost $7.75 and $6.75 for ages
12 and under. Skate rentals are $3.

FOR GERMANS, NOT ENOUGH OF A WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELIZABETH NEUFFER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The Germans won. The Americans were soundly defeated.
But there was little cheering in the streets of Berlin last night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, soccer fans here were crushed that the much-lauded
German team barely squeaked by with a 2-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I counted on a 3-0 victory,'' complained Beate Eichenberg, 39,
a public relations manager who watched the game at home Monday
night with her 9-year-old daughter, Juliane. ``The Germans should
have used their chances better.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cologne, soccer fan and writer Maternus Thoene, 39, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, we had hoped for a better team,'' said Thoene, who
gathered with a group of 10 Germans to watch the match. ``The game
was really, really bad in our view.''
</P>
<P>
   What troubled the Germans was that they thought it should have
been an easier win. Soccer here is a traditional, much-beloved
sport, one at which the Germans excel; by contrast, soccer is
fairly new in the US.
</P>
<P>
   The millions of Germans who tuned in Monday night expected their
team to play something other than the slow, stumbling match that
they did. Now there are fears that the German team won't pass
muster when it faces much tougher opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next game is against Yugoslavia, and they are a much
better team than the Americans,'' said Thoene.
</P>
<P>
   Even German national coach Berti Vogts had a dejected air.
Speaking on television, he lamented his team's poor showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't able to keep our ordnung,'' said Vogts. The word
translates as ``order,'' but in this case it refers to efficient
and methodical play, hallmarks of the German team.
</P>
<P>
   What cheering there was Monday night was for the American team.
Many members of the US team are well-known in Germany, having
played in local leagues. And the consensus was that the Americans
played much better than they did four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years ago, the Americans would have lost, 6-0,'' said
Nikolas Jaspert, a 38-year-old medieval history professor.
</P>
<P>
   Americans expatriates who tuned into the game were pleased that
the US team wasn't trounced. But some of them admitted to a certain
wistfulness: This was definitely not the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Germans played an elegant game of soccer,'' sighed Julia
Jensen, a 33-year-old attorney, ``but it just doesn't hold a candle
to an American football game.''

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Charlton Heston's initial performance as the Moses
of the National Rifle Association, chosen to lead that extremist
pro-gun organization out of the marginal wilderness of intemperate
special interest politics, has not been promising.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan proved that you could take aging movie stardom and
translate it into political power, but Heston is no Reagan. He is
not even Heston any more. It has been more than four decades since
the release of his 1956 classic, ``The Ten Commandments,'' although
he has continued to act in less successful films.
</P>
<P>
   The first line of the 73-year-old Heston's World Wide Web
biography describes him as ``an American man's man, an epic unto
himself.'' But as the recently elected NRA head, Heston nowadays
sounds as if he thinks manly is gun-crazy. He parrots the rigid NRA
cliches against gun regulations and dismisses opponents as radicals
who include gays, feminists and racial minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Heston proceeded to tell ``Meet the Press'' Sunday that he
wanted to ``return the NRA to the mainstream of American life.''
But if he has a clue as to how to do this, he didn't reveal it.
Unfortunately for him, political mainstreams generally include some
of the unmanly.
</P>
<P>
   He did not demonstrate that much has changed in the pro-gun
lobby except the name of its president. He has, in fact, long been
an advertising pitchman for the group. The difference now is that
he has a title.
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, the NRA has seemed callous and cold-blooded
as it moved from its original goal of promoting sport shooting to
fighting off all restraints on all guns in all hands for all
purposes. Its uncompromising position has been so outrageous in the
face of mounting crime and violence that it has been losing
political clout despite massive campaign contributions to friendly
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In his Sunday TV remarks that were sometimes incoherent, Heston
appeared to make a small gesture toward sanity by saying he'd go
for legislation that would require child safety locks on all new
handguns. Sarah Brady, chairman of Handgun Control Inc, a gun
control lobby, immediately professed to be delighted at his
``unexpected support.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was not clear if he had blundered or if his view
reflected that of his organization, which has previously opposed
the locks as interfering with the use of handguns for self-defense.
Heston simultaneously gave the locks the back of his hand by
dismissing them as ``really not of much use.''
</P>
<P>
   Much more significant was his stubborn defense of AK-47s,
automatic assault weapons capable of mowing down many victims at
once. Heston said he didn't like them but thought everyone had the
right to own them.
</P>
<P>
   He resorted to familiar NRA hooey that the Second Amendment
supporting ``a well-regulated militia'' is a right equivalent to
the First Amendment protection of freedom of speech, assembly and
religion.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that freedom of thought and expression in a democracy
is no more important than universal possession of a gun is an
insult to common sense in a contemporary society burdened with a
flood of uncontrolled weapons. The Supreme Court, in fact, ruled in
1939 that the Second Amendment has nothing to do with an
individual's right to ``keep and bear arms'' but merely means that
the states have the right to raise an armed militia.
</P>
<P>
   Heston also repeated NRA opposition to extending the Brady law,
named after Sarah's husband James, who was wounded in the 1981
assassination attempt on President Reagan. That law requires a
five-day waiting period between the purchase of a gun and actually
taking possession of it. It is due to expire Nov. 30, supposedly to
be supplanted by a centralized instant-check system that will allow
licensed gun dealers to quickly determine whether a customer has a
disqualifying criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   The actor objected to the projected $15 fee for the service,
which he called a tax on gun owners. But if the fee is not
assessed, that would in effect push the cost of the instant-check
program onto taxpayers and make the measure harder to pass
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Heston may represent an organization in increasingly bad odor
with a public that is fed up with unprovoked violence on the
streets and the playgrounds, but he still has friends in high
places. One of them is Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, who knows
how to parrot the NRA line with the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   Lott acted like a cheerleader before the NRA convention last
weekend, contending that the organization was already ``the
mainstream of America.'' He thinks reading the Second Amendment
literally to allow unfettered distribution of arms is so important
that any contrary reading is ``an assault on the entire fabric of
American freedom.'' (Someone give this man the Supreme Court
ruling.)
</P>
<P>
   Lott went further, calling for ``a well-armed public.'' He
suggests a pilot project to turn local police stations into
``citizen self-defense centers,'' where the cops would train
anybody who came in off the street in the purchase and use of
firearms.
</P>
<P>
   This is really innovative thinking. More guns in the hands of
more people will mean less triggers pulled! It boggles the mind.

POETS LET COMPETITIVE JUICES FLOW
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By BRUCE WEBER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAOS, N.M. _ To start with the winner _ after all, it was a
contest _ the new heavyweight poetry champion of the world is
Sherman Alexie, the 31-year-old American Indian writer from
Spokane, Wash. Alexie wrested the crown from the two-time defending
champ and the home-state favorite, Jimmy Santiago Baca, on Saturday
night here, before a crowd of 700 whooping literati.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you, Jimmy,'' a woman shrieked from the audience, a
tragedy-tinged lament, as the results of the 10-round bout were
announced. Another woman retorted in triumph: ``I love you,
Sherman.''
</P>
<P>
   Poetry has long called forth gushes of emotion; that's one of
its functions, after all. But rarely does it elicit the kind of
passion that was prevalent here, not only on Saturday, but also all
week long during the 17th annual Taos Poetry Circus, which had
poetry fans loudly in love with the likes of Ntozake Shange, Jim
Carroll, Baca and Alexie, and on occasion, screaming for blood.
</P>
<P>
   The circus brought 1,500 people to this small town an hour and a
half north of Santa Fe at the foot of the Sangre de Cristo
Mountains, an artsy haven for outdoor vacationers, Indian
spiritualists and refugees from the hippie culture of the 1960s.
The attraction was the menu of round-table readings, open-mike
slams and the first-ever tag-team poetry bout, as well as
conventional readings and a workshop for students from as far away
as the Aleutian Islands and the Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to showcase the three-ring aspect of poetry
today,'' said Anne MacNaughton, the executive director of the
circus, adding that the staid, bookish tradition of poetry ought to
be able to coexist with the angry, incantatory, oral tradition.
``We'd like to get street poets out of the street and into the
library and library poets out of the library and into the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the focus of the circus _ the main event? _ was the
championship bout, in which the poets alternated reading poems of
up to five minutes in length, with a panel of judges voting, in the
manner of a boxing match, after each round, awarding 10 points to
the winner of the round, and from 1 to 9 to the loser. The judges
(this year, an elementary school teacher, a master carpenter and a
cocktail waitress) are not given any guidelines. Is the poem more
important than the performance? Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   ``You like it? Score it high,'' said Amalio Madueno, a poet who
serves on the advisory board for the circus. ``You don't like it?
Score it low.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an odd spectacle, particularly with a ring announcer
introducing the contenders (``From Spokane, weighing in at 185
pounds, the challenger, Sherman Alexie''), a ring girl in a clingy
red dress and a crowd full of partisan fans howling at the
participants as though they were Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fun,'' Alexie said to the crowd at the start of the
sixth round, sounding surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the whole thing feels a little subversive, bringing, as
it does, the elements of competition, brash egotism and immediate
gratification to a milieu that traditionally finds those things
anathema.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers of the Taos championship bout are at great pains
to distinguish their event from slam poetry, a phenomenon that took
root in Chicago in the mid-1980s and now has its own annual
national championship event; the eighth is to take place in Austin,
Texas, in August. Nonetheless, slams and bouts are obviously cut
from similar cloth.
</P>
<P>
   Both involve competitive readings with judges providing
numerical scores and crowds going berserk. Rules vary from slam to
slam. But the primary difference is that a slam usually involves
several entrants, teams or individuals, who may or may not be
accomplished poets, while a bout is two poets, usually of some
reputation, going head to head.
</P>
<P>
   A further confusion is that the championship bout was also born
in Chicago, at a bar on Lincoln Avenue called the Oxford Pub in
1981. There, a blues singer named Jim Desmond became angered when a
poet named Jerome Sala read a poem that parodied John Lennon, who
had just died. They got into a fight, eventually agreeing to settle
the dispute with a competitive reading. They asked the bartender,
Al Simmons, to arrange it, which he did, with the cooperation of a
friend, Terry Jacobus. Sala won the first bout, as well as a
rematch.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Jacobus, a shipping clerk, happened to be a
correspondent for Rolling Stock, a magazine published in Boulder,
Colo., by the Beat poet Ed Dorn, and it was in Rolling Stock that
Anne MacNaughton and her husband, Peter Rabbit, read about the
Chicago bouts. Both writers and counter-culture devotees, they had
recently arrived in Taos and were trying to drum up a poetry scene
that would complement the gallery scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I called Al,'' said Rabbit, who still helps run the circus,
``and I said, `If you've got someone who wants to fight, we'll put
him up against Gregory Corso.'''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons, who is known at the circus as the Commissioner,
designed the whole event: the rules, the ring girl, everything. He
sent Jacobus, who won, mainly because the cantankerous Corso
alienated the tiny crowd and stalked off after the fifth round.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I was the first world champion,'' said Jacobus, 49, now a
mail room supervisor in Chicago, who was on hand for the bout on
Saturday. ``And then two days later I was back unloading toilet
paper.''

EX-FBI AGENT DENIES TIPPING OFF MOB FIGURE BEFORE ARRESTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The day before Angelo ``Sonny'' Mercurio and several
reputed Mafia associates were to be arrested in November 1989, an
FBI supervisor was on the phone with Mercurio, who had already
become an informant.
</P>
<P>
   Mercurio ticked off for the FBI agent the places authorities
could find several of the Mob figures wanted for arrest.
</P>
<P>
   But they never discussed Mercurio's whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   James A. Ring, the former head of the organized crime squad in
the FBI's Boston office, testified Monday that he wouldn't
``insult'' Mercurio by asking him his whereabouts -- even though
Mercurio was on the list of those to be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   So, when the FBI rounded up key Mafia figures the next day --
including reputed capos Joseph Russo, Vincent Ferrara and Robert
Carrozza -- &UR;  &LR; Mercurio was nowhere to be found. And he remained
among the missing for nearly five years, finally arrested in
Georgia in June 1994 with 150 pounds of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to know if I tipped him off, the answer is no,''
an angry Ring replied to a question by defense attorney Anthony M.
Cardinale, who represents reputed New England Mafia boss Francis P.
``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him in custody,'' Ring said. ``I believed if he was
in custody he might change his mind and testify.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before Mercurio fled he had provided the FBI with one
of its most prized tips ever: the exact time and place of a Mafia
induction ceremony. Agents were able to hide microphones inside the
Medford home where the secret service took place and record it --
the first tape ever of a Mafia initiation.
</P>
<P>
   While Mercurio was willing to provide information to the FBI as
a confidential informant he had refused to testify against his
fellow mobsters in court.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Cardinale why he had not asked Mercurio where he was
calling from on Nov. 13, 1989, the day before he and several
associates were to be arrested, Ring said, ``I'm not going to
insult the man. I'm going to catch him, but I'm not going to insult
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ring, in his seventh day of testimony in federal court, said it
would have insulted Mercurio's intelligence to act ``so cute and
ask him where he is in a direct manner. And he's not going to
figure it out?''
</P>
<P>
   US District Judge Mark L. Wolf, who is holding hearings into the
legality of extortion and racketeering charges brought against the
leaders of the local Irish and Italian mobs in 1995, asked Ring if
he had ever asked Mercurio's handler, agent John Conn

   Simmons, also 49, and now living in the San Francisco Bay Area,
was also on hand. He had recently retired, he said, from being the
world's greatest salesman. ``Cocaine to Cadillacs, it didn't matter
what,'' he said, adding that the spectacle of the poetry bout might
have been his finest achievement. He flies in every year. ``It's
like flying to Vegas for the fights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of, yes.
</P>
<P>
   It seems indisputable that the head-to-head contests and the
hoot-and-holler atmosphere bring in spectators who would not
otherwise have an interest in poetry, which the circus promoters
say is their primary purpose. And it does seem to elicit a certain
style of poetry: narrative, dramatic and more often than not
self-referential if not first person. It's relatively accessible
stuff. But whether any of that translates into any new poetry
readers is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that for many in the audience _ and even some of
the poets _ the competition is the primary appeal; the night before
the bout, an ordinary, noncompetitive reading by two accomplished
poets, Carroll and Victor Hernandez Cruz, drew a much smaller
crowd. And though many of the headlining poets at the circus
publish their work in mainstream journals and teach at
universities, they all acknowledged the general disdain with which
the starchy academic world holds crowd-pleasing oral events like
this. Indeed, it's hard even for the participants to agree on the
value of the competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an entertainment,'' said Patricia Smith, a columnist
for The Boston Globe who, as a poet, lost the championship a year
ago to Baca, and who has won the national slam championship four
times. ``It's a great thing for audience building. But if you're
looking for a competition to legitimize you as a poet, you
shouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, a Puerto Rican who grew up in New York City, and Ms.
Shange, both former world champions, noted that storytelling
competitions are traditional in Latin and African cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-American culture, too, if you look at the dozens,''
said Ms. Shange, who with Baca won the tag-team competition last
week. ``So it's only fitting there should be a title for it. For me
to be the champion made sense to me as a black person. So many
things we do go unnamed.''
</P>
<P>
   She loved winning when she won; so did Cruz, whose recollection
of losing, in 1990, to Anne Waldman, came with a wry grin. ''There
was a full moon,'' he said. ``Don't ever fight a woman on the night
of a full moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's bout pitted Baca, 46, who taught himself to write in
prison after a drug conviction and whose engaging grin and fiery
reading style have made him something of a local cult hero, against
Alexie, the precocious author of 10 books of fiction and poetry
about the plight of contemporary American Indians and whose film,
``Smoke Signals,'' opens on June 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like competing; it gives you a headache,'' Baca, the
author of three volumes of poetry and a book of essays, said the
day before the bout. ``You lose the sense that poetry transports
you to another place.'' He had just finished recounting, with
relish, the story of his victory two years ago over Quincy Troupe,
a man to whom he had taken a dislike.
</P>
<P>
   The bout itself was a tight contest, revealing different reading
styles and different rhetorical methods.
</P>
<P>
   Alexie's poems about life on the modern reservation and the
public perceptions of Indians, were delivered with a tiny lisp, the
poems often ending on notes of piquant, suggestive unresolve, the
poet's voice leaving the sound of the last line lingering, like a
suspended musical chord.
</P>
<P>
   Baca countered with poems about the inner strength of the common
man, particularly Mexican-Americans, whom he characterized as
ordinary people surviving through force of integrity and spirit. He
almost chanted his poems, like an evangelical preacher, ending each
on a high emotional pitch, with an emphatic rap on the lectern or a
shout.
</P>
<P>
   One judge called the bout even; the two others tilted to Alexie
by the same slim margin, 96-94, probably on the strength of the
final round, in which each poet was asked for an extemporaneous
rumination on a subject drawn from a hat. Alexie drew ``chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   After 30 seconds of cogitating time, he presented an
autobiographical poem of several stanzas that traced his growing
up, ended with the birth of his son and began with language
arresting for its metaphor:
</P>
<P>
   I was born with a river in my brain
</P>
<P>
   And when the doctors cut open my forehead
</P>
<P>
   They found 1,000 salmon skeletons.
</P>
<P>
   Baca drew ``snap beans,'' and though his rambling composition
was inventive, it couldn't match Alexie's for language or
structure.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Alexie raised his hands over his head in the manner
of a champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have been heartbroken if I lost, judging by how emotional
I feel now,'' he said. ``Don't let anybody tell you poets aren't
competitive.''

MUSICIANS PUT TIBET ON THEIR AGENDAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By JON PARELES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Tibetan Freedom Concerts came to the capital
determined to get the attention of politicians before President
Clinton's visit to China later this month. The Milarepa Foundation,
which expects to realize about $1 million from the concerts at
Robert F. Kennedy Stadium here, followed the concerts with a rally
the next day at the Capitol urging Clinton to press China to
negotiate with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled leader.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Adam Yauch of the Beastie Boys, the two shows sold
out at a total of 128,000 tickets with a bill of rock, hip-hop,
funk and their hybrids. It pulled in performers who were touring
the Eastern Seaboard (like the Beastie Boys, the Dave Matthews
Band, Sonic Youth, KRS-1, A Tribe Called Quest, Pulp, Sean Lennon
and Herbie Hancock) and others who bent their itineraries to
appear.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, lightning injured at least 11 people in the
audience, and weather forced curtailment of the Saturday show
halfway through.
</P>
<P>
   The lightning was the most startling occurrence at an event
that, in three years and three cities, has grown into its own
routine. Many of the performers appeared at previous Tibetan
Freedom Concerts; most emerged in the 1980s and early '90s. The
concerts are a '90s mixture of high-mindedness and rowdy energy,
praising nonviolence between bouts of moshing.
</P>
<P>
   The Tibetan Freedom Concerts remain the only rock event with its
own monastery, a tent where Buddhist monks and nuns chanted prayers
and danced. On the stadium stage, Tibetans spoke about their
country, where owning a Tibetan flag can mean a prison sentence.
Between rock bands were appearances by Tibetan groups like
Chaksam-Pa, performing a 500-year-old consecration dance.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in London had
responded to the plans for this year's concert by saying, ``Western
artists have no right to intervene in the internal affairs of our
country. Any of those performers who do will not be permitted entry
to China, including Tibet, and their works will never be welcome in
our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The music had to battle the echoes of this stadium, which ought
to be declared an acoustical disaster area. None of the Western
performers had songs specifically about Tibet. Bands that hark back
to 1960s rock trotted out idealistic older songs: `` `Heroes'' and
the more cynical ``Won't Get Fooled Again'' from the Wallflowers,
``Imagine'' from Blues Traveler. Others had songs about yearnings
for justice, like the Dave Matthews Band's ``Don't Drink the
Water.'' Live sang about reincarnation with ``Lightning Crashes,''
which it performed on Saturday before the storm.
</P>
<P>
   The hip-hop groups turned ``Free Tibet'' into one more
call-and-response shout, although KRS-1 also cautioned against
``China-bashing.'' But the rappers' main agenda was praising
old-school hip-hop. KRS-1 performed with break-dancers; Wyclef
Jean's disk jockey spun a medley of old hip-hop and funk sources.
The Red Hot Chili Peppers, playing a quick closing segment with
Pearl Jam's equipment left the audience chanting, ``Free Tibet if
you want to be peaceful.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The bill mirrored the eclecticism of the Beastie Boys, whose set
touched on hip-hop, hardcore and instrumental funk. Most of the
bands did what they normally do: they brooded and bashed, trotted
out hits and worked the crowd. The brooders included Pulp, singing
about self-doubt; Radiohead, singing about alienation and
technology, and R.E.M., singing four new, elegiac songs about
bygone dreams. R.E.M. had its new drummer, Joey Waronker, along
with Barrett Martin on vibraphone. In what may have been an oblique
nod to the Tibetans, R.E.M. played ``Losing My Religion.'' Michael
Stipe of R.E.M. and Thom Yorke of Radiohead each sang with the
other's band.
</P>
<P>
   For powerful noise, no one topped Sonic Youth, whose retuned
guitars filled the stadium with resonating overtones, akin to the
rich chanting of the Tibetan monks. Herbie Hancock's funk band the
Headhunters, reunited after 20 years, had changed so little since
the 1970s that it was poised to enjoy retro affection; Guru of Gang
Starr joined them to rap about jazz. The younger bands earned their
place on the bill. Buffalo Daughter, from Japan, used old
synthesizers and a steady, pulsating bass riff in a dance-music
crescendo that was both geeky and galvanizing, and Sean Lennon
fortified Beatles-style ballads with guitar muscle.
</P>
<P>
   And Pearl Jam's abbreviated set was a gem: punky and raucous in
uptempo songs and dynamic in slower ones, with wrangling,
exploratory guitars. Eddie Vedder, the band's leader, mocked people
who said that the audience didn't care about Tibet and was only
there to hear the music. ``That sounds fine to me,'' he growled.
``We have all your money.''

 'SPLAINING THE LAW OF THE LAND  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Mayhaps you found it difficult to conceal your mirth
upon learning of Vice President Al Gore's announcement nearly a
fortnight ago that the federal government would henceforth utilize
so-called ``plain language'' in its communications with the
citizenry of these Unites States of America.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, dude, you rock.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has ever tried to mow through a tax form _ even the
1040EZ _ has found himself longing for a good, simple read, like
James Joyce's ``Ulysses'' or the instructions for a cheap Japanese
electronics product.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is exceedingly difficult to write about how poorly
anyone else writes, since you open yourself up to similar
criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this has ever stopped me before. I see no reason to let
it now.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the government can't just heal itself. That's where
the Plain English Network comes in. The group has compiled a
handbook to help spice up government writing, including such hints
as ``write clearly,'' ``use active voice,'' ``use short
sentences,'' ``limit each paragraph to one topic'' and the like.
You know, the things most people learn in about the fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great if we stopped there for plain English,''
John Strylowski said. ``The problem is we go on to college.'' And
even worse: law school. &QL; 
CAPE COD CRUSADER
</P>
<P>
   Strylowski is a regulatory analyst for the Department of
Interior and a member of the Plain English Network; he was the
final editor for the handbook. He speaks pretty well himself _ the
kind of guy who will say, in all seriousness, things like, ``There
are some wonderful insurance policies out there that are just a joy
to read,'' but he has the good sense to laugh after he says it.
</P>
<P>
   He's also honest enough to acknowledge that if we're talking
about improving the way government documents are written, there
must be something lacking in the way they are written now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, gosh,'' Strylowski said, ``I can't think of anyone who
would contend that that is not true, as things stand now. The first
step in curing your problem is admitting that you have one.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, there aren't 11 more steps after that one. It's not
that easy. We're talking about years of government documents being
written in what amounts to a foreign language, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Strylowski passed along this example of how a plain English
rewrite improved one sentence in the National Park Service's Cape
Cod rules:
</P>
<P>
   _Old version (36 words) _ ``When the process of freeing a
vehicle that has been stuck results in ruts or holes, the operator
will fill the ruts or holes created by such activity before
removing the vehicle from the immediate area.''
</P>
<P>
   _New version (28 words) _ ``If you make a rut or hole while
freeing a stuck vehicle, you must fill the rut or hole before you
move the vehicle from the immediate area.'' &QL; 
FURTHER RUT SMOOTHING
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I think you could take this further. Something along
the lines of: (eight words) ``If your truck makes a hole, fill
it.'' The only word I would consider adding is KNUCKLEHEAD.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't work for the federal government. A fact for which
I'm thankful.
</P>
<P>
   The government has tried this kind of thing before. You may
recall that Jimmy Carter tried to make tax forms understandable.
Alas, like so much of what ol' Jimmy tried, people forgot about it.
</P>
<P>
   Although everyone remembers him fighting off that rabbit with a
paddle.
</P>
<P>
   Strylowski holds out higher hopes for this go-round.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of this approach that we are using is that there
are specific criteria we can use,'' he said in a sentence just
dying for clarification. ``We have the presidential memo, and that
helps. It's a cudgel we can use to hit people over the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, there's a buzz about this. There are people interested
in this and committed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny what excites D.C. types. Better this than a fling with an
intern, I suppose.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. Probably best to avoid plain English when it comes to that
story. &QL;

 &HT;    AFFORDABLE HOUSING SCARCE FOR LOW-INCOME AMERICANS, STUDY FINDS
 &HT;    Not for Atlanta
 &HT;    By REBECCA CARR
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite a robust economy, the number of low-income
households has steadily increased over the last two decades while
the pool of affordable housing has shrunk, according to a study of
national housing needs released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that the number
of low-income earners, defined as those making $12,000 or less per
year, exceeded the number of low-rent units by a 4.4 million in
1995, the latest year for which data was available.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of this gap can be seen in schools as parents shuttle
between the homes of relatives trying to provide shelter for their
children, and in tax bills as local communities try to cope with
the social problems that afflict families under such duress, said
Helen Dunlap, president of the National Low Income Housing
Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   About the only housing program that seems to win new money from
Congress is ``the development of prisons,'' said Dunlap, noting
that Congress has not approved new housing assistance vouchers for
low-income families since 1995, when the Republican Party took
control of Congress and cut additional housing assistance vouchers
from the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has sought to increase the supply of
affordable housing units, requesting 103,000 new rental assistance
vouchers in the 1999 budget. But it is far from certain if Congress
will approve such a measure. A Senate panel evaluating the request
has granted approval of 8,000 such vouchers, but the House has yet
to consider the request.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there are a lot more $6-an-hour jobs than
$6-an-hour apartments,'' said Andrew Cuomo, secretary of Housing
and Urban Development, in a statement responding to the study.
``Too many poor families are only spectators looking from a
distance at the economic prosperity benefiting most Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick A. Lazio, R-N.Y., chairman of the House subcommittee
on housing and community opportunity, said the center's study tells
the public what it already knows: there is a growing shortage of
affordable housing for the poorest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio cautioned that ``more funding for bad programs is not
the solution.'' He noted that the federal government has more than
doubled spending on programs to aid the homeless population, but it
has had little impact. ``Replacing failed programs with programs
that work and that serve more people is the answer,'' said Lazio,
who is House Speaker Newt Gingrich's point person on housing
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the call for more affordable housing units from the
administration and advocates for fair housing, some people think
the federal government should not be in the business of housing to
begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``This notion that the federal government owes everyone a house
reminds me of Russia,'' said Edward Hudgins, director of regulatory
studies at the Cato Institute, a Washington research group. ``I
would get the federal government out of the housing business. It
has no constitutional authority to provide federal housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Low-income housing is a local issue that should be placed in the
hands of the private sector, said Hudgins. He said much of the
shortage of affordable housing is a direct result of the urban
renewal programs of the 1960s, in which the federal government
razed neighborhoods and erected ``vertical ghettos'' in their
place.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, say academics and housing advocates. They say the
federal government has an obligation to step in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The income distribution between rich and poor is getting wider
and wider,'' said Cushing N. Dolbeare, a housing policy analyst.
``It's a creeping crisis. It's ironic because we are in such
prosperous economic times.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional material follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Using data compiled by the American Housing Survey, the Center
on Budget and Policy Priorities found:
</P>
<P>
   _ Eight out of 10 renters below the federal poverty line face
housing costs that exceed 30 percent of their income, the federal
standard established in 1981 under President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   _ About three-fifths of all poor renters spent more than half of
their income on rent and utilities in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   _ About 78 percent of working poor renters with children spent
more than 30 percent of their income on rent and utilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ By 1995, there were nearly two low-income renters for every
low-cost unit. In the West, there are closer to three low-income
renters for each unit.
</P>
<P>
   The study is ``kind of a slam dunk'' in showing the need for
affordable housing, said Michael A. Stegman, director of the Center
for Community Capitalism at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill and a leading expert on housing trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe that people ought not spend more than 50
percent for a roof over their head, you can use the term crisis
without saying the 'sky is falling.' We are at a crisis stage,''
Stegman said.

   DETROIT _ General Motors' North American operations moved closer
to being shut down completely Monday, as strikes at two Michigan
parts factories forced the company to idle 13,000 more workers and
partly close a host of other parts and assembly plants.
</P>
<P>
   The combined work stoppages, one at a sheet-metal stamping plant
that began 11 days ago and the other at a spark plug and
speedometer plant that began on Thursday, have now sent 63,100
workers home and closed more than 40 assembly and parts factories
in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Nearly all GM cars and
trucks require parts built at one of the two plants in Flint,
Mich., where 9,000 workers are walking picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the strikes are not settled by Wednesday,'' said James
Hall, an industry analyst with Auto Pacific Inc., ``all of GM will
likely be shut down.'' Assembly plants represent the key part of
the company's production, and 16 of its 29 assembly plants are now
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Talks at the metal stamping plant broke off Monday afternoon
after a union official accused GM negotiators of making light of
striking workers' making only $150 a week while they could be
receiving their full salaries, union negotiators said. GM denied
that such comments were made. No timetable has been set for talks
to resume. Talks at the spark plug and speedometer plant,
meanwhile, were continuing.
</P>
<P>
   The United Automobile Workers union views both strikes as a
battle to stem the tide of union jobs being moved out of North
America. General Motors maintains that the disputes concern its
efforts to catch up with its competitors by streamlining production
and gaining greater control of work practices inside the two Flint
factories.
</P>
<P>
   A few signs of progress have emerged. General Motors agreed to
return stamping dies that it acknowledged removing while the metal
stamping plant was closed during the Memorial Day weekend. Since
that concession, the top negotiators for each side have stopped
exchanging sharply worded news releases and are now negotiating in
secrecy, refusing to say anything about the tone of the talks or
the level of progress.
</P>
<P>
   But those are small rays of optimism, compared with the strikes'
financial toll on the automaker. Some analysts estimate the strikes
cost to General Motors at $40 million a day. Worst of all, the
company has lost production of more than 30,000 cars and trucks,
which translates to about $600 million in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors draws most of its profits from light trucks and
sport utility vehicles, production of which is now largely
paralyzed by strikes. Even if the strike ended on Tuesday, some
analysts argue, the loss volume would be difficult to recoup
because General Motors is scheduled to head into its two-week
summer shutdown. If there is a settlement soon, however, the
company has the option of doing away with the shutdown, a GM
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when GM's cars were not selling as briskly as
now and a strike would allow the company to slow production of
low-selling vehicles. ``But now that their operations are
profitable,'' Hall, the Auto Pacific analyst, said, ``they can't
afford not to be building cars and trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ward, an auto analyst with Paine Webber, said, ``Every
day that the strikes go on, GM is sacrificing its market share
while Ford and Chrysler continue to gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1985, Ward said, GM's market share has slipped nine
points, to about 31 percent. He contends that every 1.5 points of
market share is equivalent to 150,00 vehicles. ``GM says it needs
to cut costs,'' he said, ``but it's much easier to do that in an
environment where you're gaining share rather than risking it. ''

 &HT;    Braves Notebook: Smoltz anxious to 'make quality pitches'
 &HT;    By Tom Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Though John Smoltz got in the work he was seeking
while on injury-rehab _ his six-inning, 82-pitch outing with Class
A Macon Monday was his longest performance since he threw 88
pitches against Houston May 17 _ he hardly sounded satisfied with
his results.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to gain some confidence in the short time so that I can
go up (to Atlanta) and make some quality pitches,'' Smoltz told The
Macon (Ga.) Telegraph after coming off the mound Sunday. ''In two
or three days, I can answer that question. Right now, that's what
I'm struggling with every inning I come off the mound, not feeling
like I was ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz threw 61 strikes Sunday but bunched 17 of his 23-ball
count in two innings. He indicated before he resumed pitching that
his results were not as important to him as less tender elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ''The feeling of a good healthy elbow is not going to be there
but it's good enough to make pitches I need to make,'' he said.
''I'm going to stuggle with it from time to time. There are going
to be days like (Sunday), when it's 100 degrees and you think you
can get loose when you need to. And it didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz, on the DL since May 24, has been slotted to make his
return start Friday night in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Etc....
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox, with a win tonight, will become the all-time
winningest manager in Braves franchise history. Cox is currently
tied with Frank Selee, who won 1,004 games for the Boston Braves
(1890-1901). . . . Forget the rumors that Florida manager Jim
Leyland will resign as the Marlins sink further in the NL East. The
club owes him $1.25 million for the second half of the season.

 &HT;    Georgia assembly plant gets reprieve _ for now
 &HT;    By Kristi E. Swartz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Workers at General Motor Corp.'s Doraville (Ga.)
assembly plant got a reprieve as they were told to report to work
today, but how much longer they'll be on the job isn't known.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of progress in negotiations in Michigan leaves them
frustrated, and workers are angry they would get less than $250 a
week in unemployment benefits when the seemingly inevitable
shutdown does come.
</P>
<P>
   The strike by the United Auto Workers at two GM plants in Flint
has led to a shortage of parts in plants around the country. The
strikes by 9,200 workers at plants in Flint, Mich., have idled more
than 63,000 other GM workers at 16 assembly plants and 66
additional parts plants throughout North America.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, GM added two car plants in Lansing, Mich., and the
Cadillac plant in Detroit to the list of those affected by the
walkouts, and said it laid off several thousand more workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows anything,'' said Doraville plant worker Pat Mack.
``We take it day by day.''
</P>
<P>
   UAW members can receive up to $224 a week in unemployment
benefits, but GM will not provide layoff supplemental pay, at 70
percent of their income, according to GM Spokesman Gerry Holmes. If
workers are denied unemployment benefits, they can receive strike
pay, at $150 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Although the workers at the nonstriking plants are being shut
out of their jobs because of a lack of parts _ not because they are
on strike _ the UAW-GM contract prevents them from receiving
supplemental pay, Holmes said. It says that if a parent operation
is on strike, it applies to all operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going out because of a lack of work; nobody's prepared
for this,'' said plant worker Brad Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Labor Department Spokesman Sam Hall said UAW members who
have been with GM _ or with any employer covered by unemployment
insurance _ for four of the last five quarters should receive the
maximum unemployment benefit. ``But each claim is handled on its
own merit,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   UAW employees could begin receiving payments in one or two
weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Non-union workers are not affected by the strike and will
continue to report to work, Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, most union workers still say they support those on
strike and are ready in case they are told not to come in to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have to be prepared when you work at an auto
plant,'' said Barry Maxwell, an inspector who has been working for
GM for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   With a national convention coming up, the union may feel more
pressure to settle the dispute this week.
</P>
<P>
   The convention, which begins next Monday in Las Vegas, will be
followed on June 29 with the start of GM's annual two-week plant
shutdown. U.S. workers idled by the walkouts will not get their
union-won holiday pay for the first week of the shutdown unless
they're back at work by June 26.

 &HT;    Labor says GM strikes 'a protest against global sourcing'
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Strikes by workers at two General Motors Corp.
plants in Flint, Mich., have ravaged the giant automaker's North
American operations, now idling about 4,500 auto workers in the
Miami (Ohio) Valley and 60,000 nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But what looks like a labor dispute over local working
conditions is turning into a high-stakes battle over global
competition and keeping blue-collar jobs in GM's U.S. factories.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe the strikes by 9,200 workers in Flint are only
the beginning in the fight for survival between GM and the United
Auto Workers. Several local unions at GM's troubled plants here may
follow the Flint workers and form their own picket lines, including
3,400 workers at two GM brake plants in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   The issues splitting the UAW and GM in Flint and Dayton differ
slightly, but the heart of both disputes remains the same. GM wants
to cut costs to compete with the world's other major automakers and
stop its market share from slipping below 30 percent. The UAW wants
to protect jobs and stop its GM membership from dropping below
200,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Flint strikes are a protest against global sourcing.
Whether it's Flint or Dayton, these local disputes represent a
larger issue of where work is to be performed inside the company or
outside the company,'' said Sean McAlinden, a labor expert with the
University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get strikes like this unless both sides have a good
point to make. GM has to get itself competitive. The union thinks
there are different ways of getting competitive and you're choosing
the way that hurts us the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the Flint strikes are costing the company at least
$40 million a day.
</P>
<P>
   GM officials on Monday met separately with representatives of
two United Auto Workers union locals at the Flint Metal Center and
the Delphi Flint East plant, but no progress was reported from
either side.
</P>
<P>
   Parts shortages from the strike have closed or partially closed
13 of GM's 28 wholly owned major assembly plants, and 59 parts
plants in the United States, Mexico and Canada. So far, about 4,500
Dayton-area GM workers have been laid off at five plants. The
layoffs include about 3,900 workers at the Moraine, Ohio truck
assembly plant; 375 at the Dayton brake plants; 158 workers at GM's
air bag plant; 44 hourly employees at a suspension parts plant; and
24 workers at GM's Delphi Chassis plant in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   More plant closures and layoffs are expected today.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect most of GM's assembly plants to be down by
week's end, but parts still in the delivery pipeline could keep a
few open longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big money-makers _ pickup and sport utility vehicle plants
_ are down now,'' said Stephen Girsky of Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. ``GM can't hold out much longer beyond this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The UAW has portrayed the strikes as a fight to keep U.S. jobs
from being exported to Mexico, Thailand and South America. Its
leaders accuse GM of breaking its ``social contract'' with
Americans to provide secure jobs that pay well.
</P>
<P>
   GM said it needs to make plants more efficient to compete with
nonunion plants operated by Japanese and European companies and
foreign suppliers. GM and the union also disagree over quota and
improvement issues.
</P>
<P>
   While the strikes continue in Flint, UAW leaders in Dayton are
continuing their own fight with GM over jobs at the Ohio city's
brake plants.
</P>
<P>
   The brake plants have lost $40 million in the past two years and
have been targeted for sale or shutdown unless they become
profitable. GM and UAW Local 696, which represents workers at the
brake plants, have failed to reach an agreement after dozens of
meetings in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   GM wants to slash more than 1,800 jobs at the brake plants and
consolidate its anti-lock brake production into one factory,
according to an internal company document.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time has run out, (GM) needs a response from local union
leadership on suggested path,'' the document said.
</P>
<P>
   GM officials delivered the document to union leaders last week
in a meeting that lasted only 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to take out more than half our jobs and GM accuses
us of being unreasonable? We told them we couldn't accept anything
like that,'' said Gary Hill, president of UAW Local 696.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said GM is reneging on last year's contract agreement to
maintain at least 2,881 jobs from the brake plants by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much just wait and see from here, but we are not
going to accept concessions like that,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   GM has been cutting costs at Delphi plants for the past several
years in anticipation of an initial public offering late this year
or early next. GM's North American plants represent about
two-thirds of Delphi's business, though the company is aiming to
reduce that to 50 percent within five years. Delphi, the world's
largest maker of auto parts, must do that to have appeal as a
stand-alone company, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Selling off the parts businesses is also one way GM is reducing
its payroll. It has cut its U.S. hourly workforce by about 17
percent, or 44,000 employees, in the last four years. It still has
223,000 hourly workers in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   McAlinden believes the UAW will try to punish GM with other
strikes, possibly in Dayton, if they don't get the settlement it
wants in Flint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The International UAW has other plants lined up and ready to
go. This isn't about Flint being an old, dirty union town, it's an
international UAW strike,'' McAlinden said. ``The strike in Dayton
two years ago cost GM about $1 billion but maybe the union is
thinking that wasn't enough. Maybe it will take $6 or $7 billion
for GM to change its ways.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The turmoil in Asia sent U.S. stocks plunging Monday,
wiping out the gains of the last three months for the Dow Jones
industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   The widely followed index of blue-chip stocks fell 207 points
Monday to 8628, down 2.3 percent for the day and off 6.3 percent
from its all-time high. Some other market gauges have fallen even
more, suggesting a stock market correction is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are increasingly concerned that Asia has yet to reach
the bottom of its economic cycle. Signs of distress there are not
only persistent, but deepening.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, which many hoped would be the region's savior, announced
last week that its economy shrank sharply in the quarter ended in
March, amounting to its steepest decline since World War II. The
yen also fell to an eight-year low against the dollar. On Monday,
Japanese and other stock markets across the region fell sharply,
setting the stage for a decline when trading began on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're really seeing is a truly global market,'' said
Anthony Conroy, a managing director at Bankers Trust. ``If you
catch a cold in Asia, it really becomes a flu almost everywhere
else.''
</P>
<P>
   For American companies that do business in Japan and throughout
Asia, the prospects are growing dimmer for a recovery anytime soon.
Monday, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing became the latest of a
string of companies to warn investors that earnings would be
disappointing this quarter because of Asian problems.
</P>
<P>
   A midday spurt of buying by bargain hunters buoyed stock prices,
but sellers swamped the buyers at the end of the day. The 207-point
fall was the fifth-biggest ever for the Dow, but in percentage
terms, the 2.3 percent decline was not among the 20 worst days for
the average. The Dow average is still up 9.10 percent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's loss was the largest point decline for the Dow Jones
industrial average since it fell 222.20 points, or 2.85 percent on
Jan. 9. Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 21.83 points, a 1.99
percent drop and the Nasdaq composite index was down 29.30 points,
a 1.69 percent decline.

   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ More than 80 NATO warplanes lifted off from
European bases Monday morning, coursing across the skies over the
Adriatic Sea and Albania and Macedonia in an exercise to reinforce
NATO's demand that Serbia stop using military force against
civilians in Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   With conflict in the separatist province intensifying and,
diplomats fear, likely to spread to other Balkan countries, the
west has threatened the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic,
with measures that could eventually include air strikes unless he
stops the attacks and enters serious negotiations with leaders in
Kosovo, which has an ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   The primary target of Monday's exercise was Milosevic. It was
timed, said NATO officials, to take place on the day before he is
to meet the Russian president, Boris Yeltsin. Milosevic arrived in
Russia Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called Yeltsin Monday, and in a conversation
that lasted 40 minutes was assured by the Russian president that he
would express ``very strong sentiments'' in favor of a diplomatic
solution rather than a military response to the problems in Kosovo,
where more than 250 people have been killed and tens of thousands
displaced in the violence.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO F-16s, harriers, radar-jamming planes and tankers
assembled over the Adriatic Sea at about 8 a.m. Then, leaving the
support aircraft behind, 68 fighters flew into Albania to begin
several hours of military exercises. They went up the coast,
skirted the border with Serbia by 15 miles, flew into Macedonian
airspace, then south near Skopje. When they completed their loop
they were back over Tirana, the capital of Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed that NATO has the ability to project forces rapidly
into the area,'' said Lt. Gen. Mike Short, who is an American Air
Force officer and commander of Allied Air Forces, Southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   NATO defense ministers decided last Thursday to conduct Monday's
aerial show of force. At the same time they commissioned military
contingency plans for measures against Serbia in the event that
diplomacy failed. Those options include air strikes and the
presence of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian government had no direct comment on Monday's
exercises, but it released a statement saying the Yugoslav army had
assured Milosevic that it would take a strong stand in the defense
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   A new surge of refugees from Kosovo entered Albania Monday after
being flushed out of their hiding places in the mountains by
Serbian forces on Sunday night and making the trek to the border.
While about 400 refugees reached Albania, the refugees said
hundreds of others remained in the mountains after the Serbs sealed
off the mountain paths out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Another surge of thousands of refugees could come pouring into
Albania if fighting reaches larger towns in Kosovo, a western
diplomat in Macedonia said Monday. ``That is a trip wire for
possible NATO intervention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian officials asked that the planes converge over Tirana
and be obvious to the citizens there, so some planes went as low as
2,000 feet, shocking some civilians but pleasing government
officials. They were eager to demonstrate that the western allies
supported Albanian government policies and wanted to assure ethnic
Albanians in the region that they could put their faith in NATO.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Macedonian authorities made no similar request and the
planes here were kept above 14,000 feet, too high to be seen or
heard, although they caused plenty of consternation.
</P>
<P>
   American officials in Washington said they were counting on the
Russian president to make it clear to Milosevic that he had to stop
the killing and start talks with the ethnic Albanian majority in
Kosovo _ or suffer the consequences. But they conceded that there
is no clear consensus within NATO of what those consequences should
be _ and disagreement about whether a U.N. Security Council
resolution is essential to authorize military actions.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no Security Council resolution or if Russia vetoes
it, Washington believes that military action can be justified on
other grounds, through the NATO charter, the U.N. charter or even
as humanitarian intervention. American officials say that
international lawyers are currently looking into the problem.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic ignores or rebuffs Yeltsin, making a diplomatic
solution less likely, the Americans hope Moscow will be more
willing to vote for the Security Council resolution authorizing
force that the British are already circulating at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike McCurry, the president's press secretary, said Monday,
``I think it's very clear, and certainly the Russian government
knows, that we intend to proceed with that type of resolution if
necessary.'' Other American officials repeated Defense Secretary
William Cohen's warning, made last weekend, that the United States
and NATO would use force, if necessary, to deter Milosevic even if
Russia and the United Nations objected.
</P>
<P>
   But the British feel a Security Council resolution is required,
as do some senior German officials and the European Union as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, more than most Balkan leaders, has reason to fear
NATO air strikes. It was a bombing campaign in 1995 that brought
his proxies, the Bosnian Serbs, to negotiations that ended the war
in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Still, political and governmental leaders, at least here,
expressed profound doubts Monday that Milosevic could be easily
bombed into negotiating with the Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While the man in charge of Monday's flights, Gen. Short, spoke
at a NATO base in Aviano, Italy, calling them a ``superb
demonstration of NATO air power,'' Macedonia's foreign minister was
in his office looking worried.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Blagoj Handziski said western confusion and
bickering allowed the war in Bosnia to go on for three years, and
the trouble in Kosovo has gone from disagreement to uprising
because of the same problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The divisions within the international community worry us,''
he said. ``France, England, Germany, the United States, they all
have different opinions about what to do in Kosovo. This is a
situation that is very advantageous to Milosevic. His tactic is to
use all of these differences.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A European diplomat in the Balkans said, ``We are gambling that
by being belligerent we can control the fighting in Serbia. If we
are wrong, we will try something else. But we are asking the
Macedonians to gamble with us, and if we are wrong the Macedonians
may find themselves suddenly confronting the Serbian army.''
</P>
<P>
   But the dilemma for Macedonia is even deeper than that. While it
shares a border with Serbia of more than 150 miles, the roughly 75
per cent of Macedonia that is Slavic also shares religion, culture
and a very similar language with Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   And, the Slavs in Macedonia worry that the effort for
independence mounted by ethnic Albanians in Serbia will serve as an
example to ethnic Albanians here, who amount to some 25 per cent of
the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is asking the Macedonian government to put aside its
natural relationship with Serbia and trust that NATO can calm the
whole region enough so that there will be peace through
negotiations,'' said a senior western diplomat in Macedonia. ``The
government is under pressure from us to help us now, look to the
west now, and one day join NATO. That's want they want to do. But
are they worried? Of course they are.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Internet users can keep up-to-date on details of the
United Auto Workers strike at two General Motors plants in
Michigan, but there are few specifics on its nationwide effects.
</P>
<P>
   Striking workers from the United Auto Workers Local 659 in the
Flint Metal Center and Delphi E West units and others interested in
how the strike is affecting workers on a day-to-day basis can visit
the union local's Web site at http://www.tir.com
</P>
<P>
   /(tilde)local659.
</P>
<P>
   The local's site is bare-bones, providing striking workers with
important, and in some cases vital, information. Recent posts have
given workers information on applying for unemployment benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The local also uses its Web site to provide a morale boost to
the strikers. Rallies and potluck suppers designed to keep spirits
up during the strike are also listed. Also posted are pro-union
letters addressed to the Flint Journal (http://www.fl.milive.com).
The newspaper is providing continuous coverage of the local and
national effects.
</P>
<P>
   The United Auto Workers' national Web site (http://www.uaw.org)
is bigger and busier with official statements from UAW leadership
but not much else.
</P>
<P>
   However, users looking for the management perspective won't find
an official response on the General Motors Web site
(http://www.gm.com). At GM's site, it's just another day at the
dealership with the focus on product information. There is not one
word about the strike or its implications.

COMMENTARY: WILD IN THE COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ When future archaologists dig up Albania, they
will surely wonder what earthquake occurred here in the 1990s that
produced the bizarre layer cake that is Albania today.
</P>
<P>
   They will find Communist-era concrete bunkers now decorated with
``I love Leonardo DiCaprio'' graffiti. They will find a building in
Tirana still bearing the washed-out slogans of Albania's former
Stalinist regime _ slogans like ``Organization is the bedrock on
which the party sits'' _ overlooking a parking lot full of stolen
Mercedeses. (It is said that 80 percent of the cars in Albania
today were stolen from somewhere in Europe and then resold here.)
</P>
<P>
   They will find a country where the term ``highway robbery'' is
not a metaphor but a daily event _ largely because Albania has
still barely recovered from the anarchy of March 1997, when the
economy, which was then dominated by pyramid schemes, collapsed,
wiping out many people's savings and the government as well. They
will find a country where tax cheating is so rampant that Albania's
35th-highest taxpayer is an American-Albanian pizza parlor in the
heart of Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   They will find a country where Coopers &AMP; Lybrand accountants are
auditing the work of Deloitte &AMP; Touche accountants who have been
hired to liquidate the pyramid schemes. Meanwhile, in the streets
outside these Western accounting firms, there are regular shootouts
between rival gangs that are unfamiliar with the standards of
Coopers and Deloitte and who think ``liquidation'' is something you
do to your enemies.
</P>
<P>
   What the archaeologists will surmise is that Albania must have
been a very poor, fragile place, where the veneer of civilization
and legality was wafer-thin. And they will be right.
</P>
<P>
   This is critical to keep in mind when thinking about Kosovo _
the neighboring Serbian province populated largely by ethnic
Albanians, thousands of whom have been driven into Albania by
Serbia in recent months. Any attempt by Serbia to ethnically
cleanse Kosovo of Albanians must be stopped, not only because of
the humanitarian disaster it represents but because it could
destabilize all of Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Albania's economy cannot afford thousands of refugees, and its
politics cannot afford to be dragged into a Greater Albania
campaign _ a campaign that Albania's nasty former President Sali
Berisha, who runs a private fief in the gangster-ridden north, is
now trying to stoke up as his vehicle for riding back to power in
Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albania today is divided between two political trends,'' says
the Albanian writer Fatos Lubonja. ``One is a sort of romantic
Albanian nationalism that talks about helping our brothers in
Kosovo. The other is a (realism) that the government here is weak
and people are fed up with the country and many of them dream only
of escaping. If the fighting in Kosovo isn't stopped, there are
people here who will manipulate this nationalistic trend in order
to destabilize the new government, and that will lead to an
explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as one of America's top Balkan experts, Herb Okun,
points out, ``Bosnia implodes, Albania explodes.'' Bosnia was
surrounded by two larger powers _ Serbia and Croatia _ both of
which wanted to squeeze it between them so they could each bite off
chunks. Albania has no such hard walls around it.
</P>
<P>
   Significant numbers of Albanians are now spread out between
Albania proper and neighboring Macedonia, Kosovo, Montenegro and
Greece. A war in Kosovo that triggers ethnic Albanian separatism
and instability in Albania could easily spread to these other
unstable countries. That's why Kosovo is the fuse, but Albania is
the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   So what to do? NATO's air show for Serbia on Monday was a good
start. Because ultimately, this neighborhood cannot solve Kosovo _
peacefully _ on its own. The only conceivable diplomatic solution
requires international monitors permanently stationed inside Kosovo
to insure that the Serbs restore and maintain the cultural and
political autonomy of Kosovo's Albanians, along with monitors on
the Albania-Kosovo border, to insure that Kosovo separatists cannot
smuggle in guns to force a military solution of their own.
</P>
<P>
   This is a neighborhood of many fantasies _ Greater Serbia,
Greater Macedonia, Greater Albania, Greater Croatia, Greater Islam.
If left to themselves they will produce a Greater Explosion. &QL;

TRAINING PROGRAMS PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE TO WORKFARE JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ALAN FINDER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a corner of a bright, spacious industrial kitchen,
Linda Williams chops artichoke hearts for garlicky crostini.
Nearby, other workers mince ginger for a chicken sate marinade or
blend catfish with eggs and flour for tiny fish cakes.
</P>
<P>
   The assemblage of high-end hors d'oeuvres is commonplace in a
city with sophisticated culinary tastes, but two facts make the
bustling scene noteworthy: the kitchen is in the middle of the
South Bronx, and Miss Williams and most of her fellow workers are
on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   They are members of a new four-month training program designed
to give them enough skills and experience to qualify for
entry-level jobs in restaurant and hotel kitchens. The class is
among dozens of new, innovative efforts in New York City and around
the country by private groups _ most but not all of them nonprofit
_ to move people from welfare to work.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, these small-scale programs represent a sharp
counterpoint to New York City's mammoth workfare program, in which
more than 32,000 welfare recipients sweep streets and answer phones
in city agencies in return for public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the private approaches offer more promise because
they teach people specific skills and provide many routes out of
welfare _ instead of just handing recipients a broom or ordering
them to file papers, as New York's program typically does.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of articles published in April, The New York Times
found little evidence that workfare in New York City had provided
many participants with marketable skills or that it had helped
significant numbers of people leave welfare for full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new programs have shown intriguing results, however,
often because they identify growing sectors of the local economy
and then provide short-term training for jobs in those industries.
</P>
<P>
   A nonprofit group, working with a major brokerage house, has
moved 52 mothers on welfare into jobs as administrative assistants
and service representatives over the last three years. Another
nonprofit group, linked with a hotel chain, has helped 24 single
adults on welfare get full-time hotel jobs in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even proponents of these programs acknowledge that these numbers
are small, but they do suggest that combining specific, short-term
training with work experience can lead people to full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Independent experts who study welfare around the country say
small-scale models sometimes cannot be adapted to the large-scale
needs of cities and states, which have to move hundreds of
thousands of welfare recipients into the labor force under the
overhaul of welfare approved by Congress in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents say some of the new welfare-to-work programs
could readily be expanded to help more people. A much admired
small, private program in Chicago called Project Match has been
reconfigured for use on a broader scale in a conventional welfare
center there as well as in Iowa, Ohio, Tennessee and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Since research shows that workfare has not moved many people
into full-time jobs in cities and towns around the country over the
last 20 years, many experts say local and state governments have
incentive to try some newer approaches. That may apply particularly
in places with high unemployment, like New York, where the basic
strategy used in most states _ simply sending out welfare
recipients to search for jobs _ has had only mixed success.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of different things that can work, and the
most important thing that a city or state can do is not to impose a
narrow idea of what welfare reform can be,'' said Julie Strawn, a
senior policy analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy, a
Washington-based research and advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Even New York City, with by far the nation's largest workfare
program, has shown interest in combining work with training. About
12 percent of workfare participants also take classes for a high
school equivalency degree or in basic English.
</P>
<P>
   In rare cases, welfare recipients are given workfare credit for
participating in an experimental program. Miss Williams for
example, is technically in workfare, even though she spends her
days learning how to cook. A cheerful 45-year-old mother of five
who has been on public assistance longer than she cares to say,
Miss Williams knows first-hand the limitations of conventional
workfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working in the Bronx criminal courts, cleaning up
toilets,'' she said. ``It was awful. There was no future in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since March, she has come every weekday to the industrial
kitchen on the ground floor of a former hospital that was renovated
by a nonprofit group, the Women's Housing and Economic Development
Corp., in the Bronx. The 10-story building has 132 apartments and
vast space to accommodate a health clinic, the kitchen complex and
a day-care training center, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Williams, one of nine students in the culinary program's
first class, has learned basic cooking skills, food handling and
sanitation as well as job-search techniques in the all-day program.
``I'm learning so much here and I love it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When Miss Williams and her classmates complete the course next
month, they should be ready to work as prep-cooks in professional
kitchens. An essential part of their training has been preparing
hors d'oeuvres and other foods for the organization's new food
service, which has catered events for the Legal Aid Society, the
Ms. Foundation and other nonprofit organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting people off of welfare and creating jobs go hand in
hand,'' said Nancy Biberman, president of the Women's Housing and
Economic Development Corp. ``You've got to do both.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The new welfare-to-work programs share some important
characteristics. Most emphasize flexibility, offering participants
an array of paths to work. Many train people for specific jobs by
linking with corporations. And many are strikingly entrepreneurial.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit sponsors still depend heavily on government
financing. They supplement these revenues with money from their own
businesses and with fees that corporations sometimes pay while
welfare participants are in training.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the catering service, the women's development
corporation trains welfare mothers to become licensed home day-care
providers. The corporation also teamed up with a for-profit
company, America Works, to teach welfare recipients job-readiness
skills and interviewing techniques before sending them out to find
a job. America Works gets paid only when someone is hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of options for people here,'' Ms. Biberman
said. ``This is not a one-size-fits-all approach.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for another nonprofit group that got its
start in building housing for the poor, the Common Ground
Community. The group rebuilt the Times Square Hotel, a 652-room
single-room-occupancy hotel on West 43rd Street and Eighth Avenue
four years ago, filling it with a combination of the working poor
and people who were once homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Common Ground offers an array of welfare-to-work programs, many
of which involve experience in its own businesses, including an ice
cream shop and a catering center.
</P>
<P>
   At any time, about 70 welfare recipients work part time in these
enterprises while also taking classes in stress management,
conflict resolution and job-search techniques. Within six to nine
months, most are ready to look for a private-sector job. About 110
participants have found full-time jobs in the last two years, said
Justine Zinkin, the group's director of work force development.
</P>
<P>
   Common Ground also works in New York with Marriott Hotels Corp.,
which offers a six-week job training program for welfare recipients
selected by Common Ground. Marriott promises to hire anyone who
completes the program for positions in housekeeping and room
service, in the hotels' restaurants and as phone operators. In the
year since the program began, 26 welfare recipients began the
training, 24 completed it and 22 are still working for Marriott.
</P>
<P>
   Sobriety is usually a prerequisite to move from welfare to work.
Single adults on welfare often have a history of alcohol or drug
abuse, so many programs make abstinence a central requirement.
</P>
<P>
   A nonprofit organization called the Doe Fund is among those that
structure welfare-to-work programs to discourage participants from
sliding back into drinking or drugs. For the last three years, the
fund has supervised dozens of single men who sweep the streets and
sidewalks of the Upper East Side in bright blue uniforms that
highlight the name of their effort: Ready, Willing and Able. The
men, 150 in all, are required to live in two residences run by the
Doe Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the men were once homeless and on welfare. Now they
are off welfare, making at least $5.50 an hour keeping streets
clean. In return, they take evening classes in job readiness and
computers, and work with case managers and job counselors to move
toward independent jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a drug-treatment program, but all of our
participants have a history with drugs,'' said George McDonald, the
Doe Fund's president. ``We combined the payment of money with a
contract that said, `This is what we're going to do and this is
what you're going to do. And one of those things is that you're
going to be subject to drug testing, all the time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Participants graduate when they obtain a full-time job and their
own apartment, which can take 12 to 18 months. Each graduate gets a
$1,000 bonus.
</P>
<P>
   When the effort began nearly a decade ago, only 24 percent of
participants obtained permanent jobs. The proportion now is 54
percent, McDonald said, with graduates getting entry-level jobs in
maintenance, security, sales and construction.
</P>
<P>
   To critics who say the program's cost _ $24,000 a year for each
participant _ is too high, McDonald notes that it is similar to
keeping someone in a city homeless shelter for a year. ``We've kept
people who spent their lives in jail and on drugs out of jail and
off drugs,'' he said. ``To what extent can you not afford to
replicate this?''
</P>
<P>
   James Chisolm, 47, has been sweeping the sidewalks of East 84th
Street five days a week since February. He worked for many years as
an electrician but had not worked for the last five years because
of a drug habit. He says his life has now begun to stabilize.
</P>
<P>
   Chisolm wears six plastic key rings on a clip attached to his
belt, one for each month he has been drug-free. ``So far, so
good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For 25 years, Wildcat Service Corp. has been training welfare
recipients for jobs. But few of the nonprofit group's programs have
taken off quite like one it devised three years ago, when it
persuaded Salomon Smith Barney, the financial services company, to
join an experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Wildcat Services trains welfare mothers for 16 weeks in computer
software, business English and math and various life skills, like
dealing with an unpleasant supervisor. The trainees then go to
Salomon Smith Barney for a 16-week internship, after which the
company can hire whomever it chooses.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the corporation has hired 52 interns, or about 75
percent of those who completed the program. Many of those not hired
were placed at other brokerage houses. Of those hired by Salomon
Smith Barney, at an average starting salary of $24,000 a year, more
than 90 percent are still there.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney now wants to hire 65 people a year through
the program. It works, many executives involved say, because
Wildcat selects women who are motivated and have at least a high
school equivalency degree, and trains them for specific jobs, like
administrative assistants or telephone service representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a government agency or a nonprofit come to me
and say, `Tell me what you need and we'll train people specifically
for that,''' said Barbara Silvan, a senior vice president in charge
of human resources at Salomon Smith Barney. The company saves money
in several ways, including recruiting costs and retention (a larger
proportion of people hired through Wildcat stay at the company than
do ordinary hires).
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Dimon, the co-chief executive of Salmon Smith Barney, has
been talking up the program to other Wall Street executives. ``I've
been saying: `Guys, this works. You get high quality people, high
retention. This will save you money,''' Dimon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to do it because it's good for the country and our
city, I think that's sufficient to try things. I also think that
having the business logic is excellent.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Sheehy explores aging challenges that Viagra can't solve
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Author Gail Sheehy has some news for middle-aged men
who think Viagra is going to solve all their problems:
</P>
<P>
   It won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men face a larger challenge to their virility and vitality
than can be cured by any magic bullet,'' says Sheehy. ``There's
downsizing and divorce. Kids leaving home. A friend dropping dead
of a heart attack. Any of those can make a man feel out of control
and that he's suddenly disappearing over the hill.''
</P>
<P>
   To provide a road map for males heading into what she calls a
``second adulthood,'' the 60-year-old author of ``Passages''
interviewed hundreds of middle-aged men _ including a group in
Atlanta _ for her new book, ``Understanding Men's Passages''
(Random House, $24).
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy says most men breeze through adolescence, which now
extends into the 20s, and the ``first adulthood'' of the 30s. In
their 40s, however, men begin facing physical and psychological
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They start losing their hair, gaining weight and encountering
health problems. They may be dissatisfied with their jobs. It is a
time when many men want to stop the clock or at least turn back
time.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a period, she says, when men must shed their ``first
adulthood'' and move into their ``second adulthood.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta professor David Meltz is one of the men Sheehy found who
successfully made the transition. When he was in his late 40s a few
years ago, Meltz marched into a law school that was about to be
shut down and told the Board of Bar Examiners, ``Give me this
school. I'm the only person who can revive this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next four years, he took John Marshall Law School from
the edge of extinction to the verge of accreditation by the
American Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   But just as he was overcoming one challenge, he was confronted
with another, more personal, crisis. Under the strain of his job
and the death of his father, Meltz ended up in the hospital with a
perforated colon. His doctor gave him a choice: undergo immediate
surgery, or go home and face the possibility he would be dead by
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some deals in that hospital,'' Meltz says. ``I said,
`Get me out of here and I'm going to live like I haven't lived
before.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Meltz says, he is a different man. ``I don't fear death. I
feel I have more control than I ever did as a younger man, and that
gives me a sense of mastery.''
</P>
<P>
   Although midlife crises usually hit men in their 40s and 50s,
they can come earlier, Sheehy says. Ray Brown, a former pro
football player for the Atlanta Falcons and New Orleans Saints, was
barely in his 30s when the cheering stopped. Forced into premature
retirement, Brown says, the two years it took him to find out what
he wanted to do ``probably was the hardest time in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown praises his wife for getting a job and giving him the time
to find himself. Now owner of a remodeling company, Brown says he
has been able to move beyond his image as a football star. ``The
right mate is the key to life,'' he told Sheehy.
</P>
<P>
   Like Brown and Meltz, most men go through some kind of ``meaning
crisis,'' Sheehy says. ``They can be as insignificant as balding or
as serious as downsizing, divorce, health problems or the death of
a parent.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy, who describes herself as a ``cultural interpreter,'' has
been criticized for plucking information from serious researchers
and marketing it in a feel-good package. Life's ``crises'' _
divorce, loss of a job, birthdays _ became ``passages,'' a
less-threatening description. But her approach worked.
``Passages,'' published in 1972, sold 8 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Her new book comes as men are beginning to talk openly about
everything from impotence to their fear of aging and obsolescence.
And, with more instances of early retirement, Sheehy says members
of the boomer generation face the dilemma of what to do for the
rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't just coast. Men live too long today to spend 30
years on the golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the dilemma facing Sheehy's husband, Clay Felker. A few
years ago, the founder of New York magazine found himself out of a
job and at loose ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked through the dark woods with my husband,'' Sheehy
says. ``We took a few years to find a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually they decided that since Felker's greatest pleasure
had come from nurturing new talent, he would go into teaching.
Friends raised money to endow a chair in magazine journalism at the
University of California at Berkeley, Sheehy kept a place in New
York, and the couple built a new life with bicoastal careers.
</P>
<P>
   Like her husband, Sheehy says, the men who made the best
transition into ``second adulthood'' were those who didn't retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although they left their first career, they redirected their
efforts, became self-employed and became their own bosses. They had
a sense of mastery and had something to get up for in the
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are choosing to drop out altogether and switch roles with
their wives. As men retire in their 50s, women who have stayed home
to raise the kids are just getting started in midlife careers,
Sheehy says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could work out very well for men who feel secure. A man
who has a partner who is excited about her career maturing may take
some of the financial responsibilities off his shoulder so he has
time to explore.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy sees this situation as an opportunity for men to redefine
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of being warrior and provider, they can become the
kinds of fathers their own fathers were not. They can become closer
to their wives and connect with their feelings. And that's better
than any magic pill.''

 &HT;    `Saving politics from itself' goal of public interest group
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new public interest campaign to end political
mudslinging opened here Monday with this cheery tidbit: Fewer than
one in 10 Americans follow news about candidates and elections very
closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, things don't look good for voter participation in
November,'' said Andrew Kohut, pollster for The Pew Research Center
for the People &AMP; the Press.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop of declining voter interest, the Alliance
for Better Campaigns officially launched a 10-state program to
``save politics from itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The group is urging television news directors to run regular,
five-minute ``mini-debates'' with candidates on issues, and
broadcast pieces that explain the truthfulness of political
advertisements, so called ``Ad watch'' boxes.
</P>
<P>
   It wants politicians to commit to a code of conduct, pledging to
abide by standards of honesty and accountability, and appear in
their own TV advertisements, which might make some less willing to
launch unsubstantiated attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to teach candidates to curtsy and bow,'' said
Rebecca Rimel, president of the Pew Charitable Trusts, which is
funding the Alliance's work. ``We want to see the candidates run
hard, fight hard ... and give the public an honest, fact-driven
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10 pilot states are Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida,
Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Faucheux, editor of Campaigns &AMP; Elections, said the
Alliance's effort is a positive step because campaigns won't hold
themselves to higher standards. ``It has to be done by (outside)
moral assuagement,'' he said. ``It's not going to come from within
the political community. The incentive there is to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But a panel discussion among TV news directors and two political
consultants staged for Monday's kick-off demonstrated the gulf
between the Alliance's lofty goals and the day-to-day business of
managing both television news and political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Kam Kuwata, campaign manager for Rep. Jane Harman's failed bid
for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in California,
complained that the Harman campaign received virtually no
television coverage on the issues. He said consultants such as
himself increasingly had to rely on ``stunts,'' such as staging a
pancake breakfast for reporters to prove that an opponent
flip-flops on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Douglass, a former California political reporter now with
ABC News, said it was a ``constant battle'' convincing news
directors to run issue stories. ``The assumption was that people
would change the channel,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Himstedt Riley, news director of WSFA-TV in Montgomery,
Ala., said her station had solved the problem of making politics
interesting by allowing voters to pose the questions to candidates
in this year's hotly contested gubernatorial race.
</P>
<P>
   The news directors said they frequently encountered problems
getting candidates to commit to debates, particularly candidates
ahead in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Cochran, president of the Radio-Television News
Directors Association, was cool to the idea of free air time for
candidates, saying it simply allowed candidates to ``rehash
restated positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Taylor, executive director of the Alliance and a former
Washington Post reporter, left journalism two years ago to campaign
for more free television time for candidates. But he said he
learned a hard lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask a broadcaster for free air time, you earn his
wrath,'' he said. ``Air time is what he sells, not what he gives
away.''

ANNAN URGES FORMATION OF WAR CRIMES COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, Great Britain, France)  (mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Warning that the eyes of past and future victims ``are
fixed upon us,'' the U.N. secretary-general Monday urged
establishment of a global war crimes court as a ``bulwark against
evil.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general, Kofi Annan, opened a five-week conference
here to develop rules for a permanent tribunal that could prosecute
individuals for crimes against humanity. He urged the delegates,
from 156 nations, to take a firm stand: ``I trust you will not
flinch from creating a court strong and independent enough to carry
out its task. It must be an instrument of justice, not
expediency.''
</P>
<P>
   But just how strong and independent such a court will be is one
of the critical issues to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants to limit the court's jurisdiction.
Washington is concerned that unless the Security Council has a say
in what crimes are brought to trial, American soldiers around the
globe could be prosecuted on politically motivated charges.
</P>
<P>
   But such traditional American allies as Britain and Canada say
the court should work as independently as possible and are leading
a coalition of 40 to 50 nations, the ``like-minded group,'' that
want to minimize Security Council involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Before hunkering down in private to debate more than 400
disputed articles in the draft, the two sides moved quickly Monday
to stake claims in the battle for public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   There is broad consensus that the court should be called in only
when national courts are unable or unwilling to act, and only for
the gravest of crimes, like genocide and civilian massacres.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the systematic use of sexual assault in wars in
the Balkans and Rwanda, the court is expected to include rape as a
recognized war crime for the first time, alongside torture,
prisoner abuse and violence against civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Support is not quite as widespread for a provision mandating the
court to prosecute crimes committed during internal conflicts,
which account for 90 percent of the victims of war today. Some
states argue that the court should only investigate crimes in
conflicts between nations. These arguments are viewed as fatally
obstructionist by human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   France, for example, is leading an effort to require the court
to obtain a nation's consent before investigating crimes committed
by its leaders or soldiers. Rights groups have denounced that
proposal as tantamount to destroying the court's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Canada, which holds the chairmanship of the conference, has
warned that members of the ``like-minded group'' might walk away
from a treaty rather than allow it to be watered down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make it very clear to those who are trying to
compromise down to the lowest common denominator that they have no
chance,'' warned the Canadian foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy.
Having no court ``is better than a Potemkin village.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Axworthy and Annan cited the treaty to ban the use of land
mines as a promising precedent to build popular support for the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Last year more than 120 nations signed a treaty to ban the
production and use of anti-personnel land mines in a conference in
Ottawa that was organized outside U.N. channels. The United States,
Russia and China did not sign the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Hinting at the way the United States was isolated on the
land-mine issue, Annan told reporters, ``No one country, I hope,
will want to be responsible for the failure of this conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy said that in terms of public relations, the court would
be a harder sell than the ban on land mines. ``On land mines, we
had Princess Diana looking at broken children in Angola,'' he
explained. ``The court is more abstract; people don't get as
excited by legal issues, especially where lawyers are concerned.''

   Washington _ Despite a robust economy, the number of low-income
households has steadily increased over the last two decades as the
pool of affordable housing has shrunk, according to a study of
national housing needs released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that the number
of low-income earners, defined as those making $12,000 per year or
less, exceeded the number of low-rent units by a 4.4-million margin
in 1995, the latest year for which data was available.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of this gap can be seen in schools as parents shuttle
between the homes of relatives trying to provide shelter for their
children and in tax bills as local communities try to cope with the
social problems that afflict families under such stress, said Helen
Dunlap, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   About the only housing program that seems to win new money from
Congress is ``the development of prisons,'' said Dunlap, noting
that Congress has not approved new housing assistance vouchers for
low-income families since 1995 when Republicans took over Congress
and cut additional housing assistance vouchers from the federal
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Administration has requested 103,000 new rental
assistance vouchers in the 1999 budget. But it is far from certain
if Congress will approve such a measure. A Senate panel evaluating
the request has granted approval of a 8,000 such vouchers, but the
House has yet to consider the request.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there are a lot more $6-an-hour jobs than
$6-an-hour apartments,'' said Andrew Cuomo, secretary of Housing
and Urban Development, in a statement responding to the study.
``Too many poor families are only spectators looking from a
distance at the economic prosperity benefitting most Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the rental voucher program say the federal
government should not be in the housing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This notion that the federal government owes everyone a house
reminds me of Russia,'' said Edward Hudgins, director of regulatory
studies at the Cato Institute, a conservative Washington D.C. think
tank. ``I would get the federal government out of the housing
business. It has no consitutional authority to provide federal
housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick A. Lazio, (R-NY.), the chairman of the House
subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, cautioned that
``more funding for bad programs is not the solution.'' He noted
that the federal government has more than doubled spending on
programs to aid the homeless, but it has had little impact.
``Replacing failed programs with programs that work and that serve
more people is the answer,'' said Lazio, who is House Speaker Newt
Gingrich's point person on housing issues.
</P>
<P>
   Housing advocates say the situation is dire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The income distribution between rich and poor is getting wider
and wider,'' said Cushing N. Dolbeare a housing policy analyst.
``It's a creeping crisis. It's ironic because we are in such
prosperous economic times.''
</P>
<P>
   Using data compiled by the American Housing Survey, the Center
on Budget and Policy Priorities found the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ Eight out of every 10 renters below the federal poverty line
face housing costs that exceed 30 percent of their income, the
level of affordability for federal housing established in 1981
under President Reagan's Administration.
</P>
<P>
   _ About three-fifths of all poor renters spent more than half of
their income on rent and utilities in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   _ About 78 percent of working poor renters with children spent
more than 30 percent of their income on rent and utilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ By 1995, there were nearly two low-income renters for every
low-cost unit. In the West there are closer to three low-income
renters for each unit.

NORTEL-BAYNET DEAL UNITES COMPUTER NETWORKING, TELEPHONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After months of rumors, Northern Telecom Ltd. Monday said it
would acquire Bay Networks Inc. in a $7.19 billion stock deal that
showed how quickly the worlds of computer networking and telephone
communications are converging.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Canadian-based Nortel will exchange 0.6
share of its stock for each Bay Networks share. Based on Monday's
closing price of $54 a share for Nortel, the transaction values Bay
at $32.40 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel shares plunged Monday by 9 11/16, slashing the deal's
value from $9.1 billion, the amount announced based on Friday's
closing price. Bay Networks stock closed Monday at 30, up 2 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Networks of Santa Clara, Calif. is the nation's third-
largest computer networking company and was created through the
merger of California-based Synoptics Inc. and Wellfleet
Communications Inc. of Billerica, Mass. Bay Networks still has
2,000 employees in Massachusetts. Nortel is North America's No. 2
telephone equipment maker.
</P>
<P>
   The Nortel-Bay Networks combination is the largest merger yet
between a telecommunications company and a computer networking
concern. Companies that deal with voice communication are looking
to catapult &UR;  &LR; into the fast-growing field of data communications,
while computer networking companies are looking to reach new
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest challenge to the new Nortel will be to execute
cleanly on the vision,'' said Michael Duran, an analyst at Lazard
Freres &AMP; Co. LLC. ``They will have the most comprehensive product
portfolio in the industry for data and voice networking for homes,
business and telephone service providers.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by the pell-mell growth of the Internet and businesses
relying on computer networking, both companies see the convergence
of voice and data as their future &UR; . &LR;  Along with rivals Lucent
Technologies Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. they see the technology
barriers distinguishing computer networking from &UR;  &LR;  voice telephone
technology disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nortel wants to provide a supermarket of products and services
to telephone carriers and large corporations and with this deal for
Bay, we'll start to see greater consolidation of both data
networking and telephone equipment companies,'' predicted Roger
Wery,  &UR;  &LR; vice president at Renaissance Worldwide, a large consulting
company in Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street and industry analysts have questioned whether Nortel
and Bay Networks can overcome cultural differences to successfully
compete against the biggest computer networking companies and
telephone equipment suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a cultural nightmare where the two companies' senior
managers, one on the voice side and the other on the data side,
have to go up against Cisco, the most formidable competitor in
computer networking,'' said Maribel Lopez, a network strategies
analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Both Nortel and Bay Networks executives maintain those
differences are minor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the cultural concerns, but we are not merging Bay
Networks into Nortel. Instead we'll have &UR;  &LR; Bay operate as an
independent business unit, one that we know is compatible with
Nortel's operations, which we think are technologically and
culturally compatible,'' said David House, Bay Networks chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   House, a former Intel Corp. senior executive, will become
president of Nortel and join its board. He will report to John
Roth, who will continue as Nortel's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Both men said no layoffs are expected after the deal and that
they expect to add employees in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Networks itself has coped with the aftermath of a merger.
After the 1994 merger of Wellfleet and Synoptics, the bicoastal
company _ renamed Bay Networks _ struggled to combine two disparate
organizations and only recently has Bay Networks begun to live up
to analysts expectations.
</P>
<P>
   For Nortel, the deal with Bay Networks caps a recent string of
investments and acquisitions in Massachusetts. In April, Nortel
acquired Aptis Communications Inc. of Chelmsford in a $305 million
stock deal and it recently invested close to $25 million in Avici
Systems Inc., also based in Westford.

RUSSELL'S CELTICS VS. JORDAN'S BULLS: WHO'S ON TOP? 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By IRA BERKOW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never in the 51 years of the National Basketball Association has
there been a dynasty to compare with Bill Russell's Celtics. Unless
it is Michael Jordan's Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's teams won 11 championships in 13 years. Jordan's have
won six in his last six full seasons, considering that he took a
year-and-a-half sabbatical to try his hand at minor league
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The dynasties started 35 years apart, with Russell's running
from the 1956-57 season through 1968-69 and Jordan's from 1991-92
through 1997-98. Two different eras. Two different ensembles. Two
different kinds of stars. Jordan scores famously by soaring and
swooping to the hoop. Russell defended famously by soaring and
swatting balls away from the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   So, how do pro basketball's biggest dynasties compare? And what
does it say about the way the game has changed? Are Jordan's Bulls
the equal of Russell's Celtics? Are they better?
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you compare the two?'' asked Red Auerbach, the coach of
nine of those Celtics championship teams and now a vice chairman of
the Celtics' board at age 80. ``How do you compare Ali to Louis, or
Dempsey? You can't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be slanted a little bit, but there's no question in my
mind that we could do well against them,'' he said. ``If anybody
says that the players of this era are better than those of the past
era _ well, I don't buy that for a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were excellent defensively and, with Russell, dominating on
the boards, where games are often won or lost. Are the Bulls
faster? No. We could run with them all day long. Are they smarter?
No. Could they shoot better? No. The guys of our era _ Havlicek,
Heinsohn, Sam Jones, Sharman, Bailey Howell _ were all outstanding
shooters and scorers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry West, a Hall of Fame player for the Lakers in those
Celtics years and the Lakers' general manager in the Bulls' era,
agrees to some extent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't necessarily believe that a modern team is better than
one of that past era, but the comparisons are interesting,'' he
said. ``Each team, for example, had one dominating player _ Russell
for the Celtics, Jordan for the Bulls _ plus superb role players
around them. But there is an ``X'' factor. That is Michael Jordan.
He's an incredible player, the greatest player I've ever seen. He's
the best offensive player I've ever seen, and his defense is second
to none. He's the modern-day Babe Ruth.''
</P>
<P>
   Rod Thorn, who played for Chicago during the Celtics dynasty and
is now in charge of basketball operations for the NBA, believes the
Bulls have another advantage: Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russell was in a class by himself defensively and
competitively, like Jordan,'' Thorn said. ``But no team has had two
phenomenal, all-around athletes like Jordan and Pippen on the same
team. The Bulls are more athletic than the Celtics were, and in a
game or a series, the Celtics would have no antidote for Pippen.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Embry, who played with and against those Celtics teams and
has been general manager of the Cavaliers, had trouble deciding
which team was superior. ``Jordan refuses to lose,'' he said.
``Like Russell. Both always found a way to beat you.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons are difficult because the two eras are so vastly
different, from life on the road to the skills of the players to
the makeup of the league itself.
</P>
<P>
   For example, travel was more difficult in the Celtics' era,
Auerbach pointed out. ``After a game, we'd have to catch a tiny
DC-3, and then try to grab a bite of food on the way,'' he said.
``Or we'd have to go by train. You'd board at 1 in the morning and
be in the next town at 5 a.m., and stagger to your hotel. Today,
teams have chartered planes, and stewardesses bring them their
meals.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was easier to keep a good team together during the
Russell years than in today's era of free agency, making a dynasty
harder to come by now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier for players to defect,'' said Atlanta Coach Lenny
Wilkens, who was a star guard with the St. Louis Hawks and the
Seattle SuperSonics during the Celtics' era. ``In the days before
free agency, you had a lock on a player unless you trade or sell
him or he retires.''
</P>
<P>
   And players today have many more choices if they want to move.
When Russell's teams began their dynasty, in 1956, there were just
eight teams and a maximum of 96 players in the league (the number
of teams increased to 14 by their last championship in 1969). Now,
there are 29 teams and 348 players.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens believes that growth makes the competition stronger.
``Both the Celtic and Bulls teams were great, but the number of
teams today might make it harder to win,'' he said. ``So many more
teams can knock you off.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson, a player for the Celtics in their dynasty years and
a coach and general manager of other teams in the Bulls' years,
sees it differently. ``Imagine the talent level in the NBA when you
only had nine or 11 or 14 teams,'' he said. ``It was tougher then.
The talent level was exceptionally high all over the league. It
wasn't watered down a little bit the way it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny ``Red'' Kerr, the Bulls' broadcaster who was a star
center with Syracuse in the early years of the Celtics' dynasty and
then the Bulls' first coach (1966-68), agreed. ``The Bulls might go
against some of the best teams, like Olajuwon and Houston, or Shaq
and the Lakers, just twice in a season,'' Kerr said. ``Russell had
to go against Chamberlain and Nate Thurmond and Pettit 11 times in
a season.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Russell, 11 other Celtics of that era made the Hall of
Fame as players, from Andy Phillip in the first year to John
Havlicek in the last. Only Pippen seems a certainty to make it
among Jordan's teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson thinks it curious that most outstanding teams are strong
either at center or point guard, or both, as were the Celtics.
``But the Bulls are different, in that their strengths are at
shooting guard, Jordan, small forward, Pippen, and power forward,
Rodman,'' he said. ``The rest of the players are role players. But
because of the presence of Jordan, they have elevated their game.''
</P>
<P>
   West agreed, saying that some of those role players who have
been very helpful might not even make other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson added: ``Russell also helped elevate the Celtics with his
winning attitude, which, like Jordan's, permeates the locker room.
But I thought that the great Celtic teams had more depth than the
Bulls. They'd bring in Frank Ramsey or Clyde Lovellette or Willie
Naulls or Larry Siegfried or Embry _ all outstanding players.'' He
might also have added the name of Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they averaged about 115 points a game, which the Bulls
don't match, while keeping the opposition scoring way down,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While Russell won a title in his first season as a pro, it took
Jordan seven years to win his first. ``It took time for management
to assemble the right players around him,'' Wilkens said. ``But
once he got it going, there was no stopping him.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one player was part of the Celtics' dynasty from the first
season to the last, and that was Russell. As for the Bulls, only
two players remain from the teams that won three titles before
Jordan left for baseball: Jordan and Pippen. So, despite a virtual
total turnover in both eras, the extraordinary stars kept the
dynasties intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this also says a lot about management of both teams,''
Wilkens said. ``Auerbach was able to surround Russell with some
great players, while Jerry Krause was able to get exceptional role
players for Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens mentioned, in particular, the trade for Pippen, and then
Horace Grant, and then the signing of Toni Kukoc from Europe. He
also noted that the Bulls have been able to get such helpful
centers as Bill Cartwright, Brian Williams and Luc Longley, as well
as 3-point shooters such as Craig Hodges, John Paxson, Bobby
Hansen, Trent Tucker and, now, Steve Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Ron Harper _ don't forget him,'' Wilkens said. ``He's one
of the smartest players in the game, and does a superb job on
defense. And before coming to the Bulls said he was finished as a
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Holzman, the coach of the Knicks' two championship teams and
currently a consultant for New York, added another reminder.
``Don''t forget the coaches,'' he said. ``Auerbach's in the Hall of
Fame, and I think Phil Jackson should be too. He's handled some
difficult situations with fantastic balance. Like getting the best
out of Dennis Rodman. A lot of coaches wouldn't have been able to
deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaching has improved in this era, making it harder to win,
Embry said. ``Just the use of videotape in order to put in defenses
has made a huge difference,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the players have changed too. ``Weight training has raised
them a level,'' Embry said.
</P>
<P>
   But players are generally younger and less experienced today,
with the best leaving college early and a handful coming into the
league directly out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many kids today are wonderfully skilled, but they haven't
learned proper fundamentals,'' West said. ``So when they run into
trouble, they have nothing to fall back on. But not Jordan. That's
one of the many places where he creates distance from many of his
opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Kerr pondered the question of who would win a championship
series matching a team from the Celtics' dynasty against a Bulls
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tough one,'' he said. ``I see the series going into
overtime in the seventh game.'' &QL;

ROYAL SWEDISH BALLET: GOING STRONG AT 225 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: The different spellings of Gustaf and Gustav are CQ.) 
(mk) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden _ The Royal Swedish Ballet ended its
225th-anniversary festival on Saturday night here with a lively
four-hour gala. During an eight-day marathon that included a
delightful ``Nutcracker'' with a Swedish flavor, the company
presented past and present repertory. The gala program did the
same, with guest artists from France, Italy and Denmark, all
countries whose dancers and ballet masters played a role in Swedish
ballet's history.
</P>
<P>
   King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia attended the performance
at the Royal Opera House and led the standing ovation at the end
from the royal box. The King took some good-natured ribbing from
Rolf Skoglund, an actor who gave a first-class impersonation of the
18th-century Swedish king Gustav III.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing his French ballet master, Louis Gallodier (Istvan
Kisch), this Gustav recalled onstage that when he created his
ballet company in 1773 he did not want it to be ``a mere branch of
the Paris Opera Ballet.'' It was to be Swedish in spirit and
content. Catapulted into the present by the end of the program and
looking around for someone of ``equal rank,'' he told the current
king that priority must be given to support of the arts.
</P>
<P>
   The point might have more effect if addressed to politicians,
but it was well taken. The days are past when any 18th- or
19th-century monarch in Europe, and that includes Russia, could
start a ballet company by inviting the pertinent business
consultants of the day: French and Italian ballet masters.
</P>
<P>
   Filippo Taglioni, an Italian ballet master who worked in Paris
and Stockholm, was recalled on Saturday by an excerpt from his 1832
version of ``La Sylphide.'' Nicolas Le Riche, Elisabeth Platel and
Karin Averty, the high-powered stars from the Paris Opera Ballet,
danced the Act 1 pas de trois from Pierre Lacotte's familiar
reconstruction, very different from the Danish version
choreographed by August Bournonville in 1832. It was, of course,
Taglioni's daughter, the Swedish-born Marie Taglioni, who danced
the original ``Sylphide.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bournonville was remembered as well. His French father,
Antoine Bournonville, was a principal dancer in the Royal Swedish
Ballet and he himself headed the Swedish Royal Opera House from
1861 to 1864.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Marie Vessel, from the Royal Danish Ballet, choreographed a
version of a scene from ``Bellman,'' an 1844 ballet that August
Bournonville choreographed about Carl Michael Bellman (1740-95), a
Swedish poet and composer still beloved for his songs about nature,
love and drink. Johan Kobborg and Henriette Muus from the Royal
Danish Ballet were charming if muted in the mimed and danced love
spat between Bellman and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Fracci, a superstar from Italy, was given chiefly
impressionistic images from Isadora Duncan's life and dances in
``Homage to Isadora Duncan.'' Slowly but potently she worked her
magic as a Duncan mourning her drowned children.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography by Millicent Hodson and Kenneth Archer is not
the best on the Isadora theme but it works as a vehicle for Ms.
Fracci, one of American Ballet Theater's greatest ballerinas in the
1960s and 1970s. As Lena Nordin sang Schubert's ``Ave Maria,'' Ms.
Fracci's dramatic power channeled the gestures of a mother cradling
a child into an image of Duncan strangled by her scarf.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dramatic power is also the strong suit of the Royal Swedish
Ballet. As Le Riche showed by comparison, sheer dance power as
expressed through brilliant classical technique takes second place
here. If things go as planned next year, Americans in Washington;
Costa Mesa, Calif., and later at the Brooklyn Academy of Music will
see a troupe with an admirable ensemble spirit and expressive
presence.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise of the second half of the festival was the
``Nutcracker'' choreographed by Par Isberg, a principal dancer who
is now the company's resident choreographer. He and Erik Naslund,
the director of the Swedish Dance Museum, have fashioned a fresh
and engaging scenario that stays true to the spirit of the original
1892 ``Nutcracker,'' but draws upon the Swedish children's books of
Elsa Beskow (1874-1953).
</P>
<P>
   It helps to be a Swede to recognize the characters and the
Christmas folk customs. But even if you don't know that Petter and
Lotta are orphans living with three aunts and have a little black
dog, there is no mistaking the warmth of the tree-cutting ritual,
Christmas preparations and party of Act 1.
</P>
<P>
   The live black poodle who frolics or runs across the stage on
cue is the scene-stealer. But at Friday's performance, there was
genuine emotional impact from Hans Nilsson as the charcoal burner
transformed into a prince, and the exceptionally talented Marie
Lindqvist as the housemaid who becomes his princess in the fine
classical pas de deux Isberg has choreographed in Act 2. For Lotta
and Petter, exuberantly portrayed by Ann Brattselius and Jens
Rosen, this ideal vision of the parents they do not have is
psychologically right.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to focus on the success of Bo-Ruben Hedwall's
adaptation of Beskow's illustrations: a village street toward which
a sleigh rides at the end of the ballet, as well as an interior
with a tile stove that grows in size along with the tree whose
paper snowmen and other ornaments come to life. Above all, Isberg
has avoided provincial charm.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Tchaikovsky's music has been cut and this ``Nutcracker''
is not a grand classical spectacle. But Isberg is impressively
fluent in two big classical ensembles, the ``Snowflakes'' and the
``Waltz of the Flowers.'' There is a wonderful use of folk forms.
The live nutcracker doll is here a traditional gift-bearer in a
straw goat's mask.
</P>
<P>
   The company showed a more serious side earlier in the week in
John Neumeier's ``Mahler's Third Symphony'' and Kenneth MacMillan's
``Mayerling.'' The second was not as well danced as the first. But
in this Swedish ``Nutcracker'' for all seasons (a must on a U.S.
tour), the company showed its heart.

 &HT;    Low-income housing on increase, study showsBy Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ Despite a robust economy, the number of low-income
households has steadily increased over the last two decades as the
pool of affordable housing has shrunk, according to a study of
national housing needs released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that the number
of low-income earners, defined as those making $12,000 per year or
less, exceeded the number of low-rent units by a 4.4-million margin
in 1995, the latest year for which data was available.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of this gap can be seen in schools as parents shuttle
between the homes of relatives trying to provide shelter for their
children and in tax bills as local communities try to cope with the
social problems that afflict families under such stress, said Helen
Dunlap, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   About the only housing program that seems to win new money from
Congress is ``the development of prisons,'' said Dunlap, noting
that Congress has not approved new housing assistance vouchers for
low-income families since 1995 when Republicans took over Congress
and cut additional housing assistance vouchers from the federal
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Administration has requested 103,000 new rental
assistance vouchers in the 1999 budget. But it is far from certain
if Congress will approve such a measure. A Senate panel evaluating
the request has granted approval of a 8,000 such vouchers, but the
House has yet to consider the request.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there are a lot more $6-an-hour jobs than
$6-an-hour apartments,'' said Andrew Cuomo, secretary of Housing
and Urban Development, in a statement responding to the study.
``Too many poor families are only spectators looking from a
distance at the economic prosperity benefitting most Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the rental voucher program say the federal
government should not be in the housing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This notion that the federal government owes everyone a house
reminds me of Russia,'' said Edward Hudgins, director of regulatory
studies at the Cato Institute, a conservative Washington D.C. think
tank. ``I would get the federal government out of the housing
business. It has no consitutional authority to provide federal
housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick A. Lazio, (R-NY.), the chairman of the House
subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, cautioned that
``more funding for bad programs is not the solution.'' He noted
that the federal government has more than doubled spending on
programs to aid the homeless, but it has had little impact.
``Replacing failed programs with programs that work and that serve
more people is the answer,'' said Lazio, who is House Speaker Newt
Gingrich's point person on housing issues.
</P>
<P>
   Housing advocates say the situation is dire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The income distribution between rich and poor is getting wider
and wider,'' said Cushing N. Dolbeare a housing policy analyst.
``It's a creeping crisis. It's ironic because we are in such
prosperous economic times.''
</P>
<P>
   Using data compiled by the American Housing Survey, the Center
on Budget and Policy Priorities found the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ Eight out of every 10 renters below the federal poverty line
face housing costs that exceed 30 percent of their income, the
level of affordability for federal housing established in 1981
under President Reagan's Administration.
</P>
<P>
   _ About three-fifths of all poor renters spent more than half of
their income on rent and utilities in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   _ About 78 percent of working poor renters with children spent
more than 30 percent of their income on rent and utilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ By 1995, there were nearly two low-income renters for every
low-cost unit. In the West there are closer to three low-income
renters for each unit.

   Burnett Bows Out of Glad Account
</P>
<P>
   Another long relationship between an advertiser and an agency is
ending as the Leo Burnett USA unit of Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago
has resigned the Glad brand account of First Brands Corp. in
Danbury, Conn., after working on campaigns for Glad plastic
products since 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Petersen, a spokesman for Burnett, said the resignation
stemmed from the agency's being unable to participate in a review
that First Brands began in April for a single agency to handle
consolidated advertising duties for Glad, the STP line of
automotive products and three brands of cat litter. Burnett could
not take part, Petersen said, because STP posed a conflict with the
agency's account with Amoco Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett helped the Glad brand's previous owner, Union Carbide
Corp., develop and introduce plastic wrap and bags to consumers.
Memorable campaigns included ``the Man from Glad'' in the 1960s and
``Don't get mad, get Glad'' in the 1970s. Glad ad spending last
year totaled $6.5 million, according to the Competitive Media
Reporting unit of VNU NV. Among the agencies taking part in the
First Brands review are Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising in New York,
which handles STP, and McCann-Erickson New York, part of the
McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising unit of Interpublic Group of
Cos., which handles the Jonny Cat, Scoop Away and Fresh Step cat
litter brands.

DUNLAP DISMISSED AS CHAIRMAN OF SUNBEAM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   For years, Albert J. Dunlap has been one of the nation's most
feared corporate executives. He downsized with a vengeance,
frequently boasting of the thousands he had thrown out of work to
lift his companies' stock prices, earning himself the nickname
``Chainsaw Al.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it is Dunlap who has been thrown out of a job. Over the
weekend, the self-proclaimed turnaround artist, who had run Sunbeam
Corp. for almost two years, was dismissed as chairman in a revolt
by a board led by some of his hand-picked directors.
</P>
<P>
   Saying it no longer believed Dunlap had the skills to revive the
ailing consumer appliance maker, the board announced Monday that
Sunbeam's financial results for the rest of the year would be far
worse than expected and that it needed a new leader.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap, who wrote in his best-selling autobiography, ``Mean
Business,'' that the best bargain is an expensive chief executive,
became known for his wholesale sacking of factory workers and
managers alike, both at Sunbeam and elsewhere. He was tirelessly
self-promotional, popping up repeatedly on television for the last
two years plugging his book and, calling himself ``Rambo in
pinstripes,'' preaching his slash-and-burn philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap was known to pass out autographed copies of the book
freely to Sunbeam employees, bankers, waiters, even doormen _
anyone who would take them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outside directors have unanimously taken this decisive
action because we have lost confidence in Dunlap's leadership,''
said one board member, Peter A. Langerman, chief operating officer
of Franklin Mutual Advisors Inc., Sunbeam's largest shareholder,
who will replace him as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry W. Levin will become the chief executive officer and try
to put things back on track. He is an executive vice president of
MacAndrews &AMP; Forbes Holdings, Sunbeam's second largest shareholder,
and a former chief executive of Revlon Inc. and Coleman Co., which
Sunbeam recently purchased.
</P>
<P>
   But his dismissal is not likely to end to Dunlap's dealings with
Sunbeam. On paper, Dunlap is owed a severance package worth as much
as $40 million. But the board has other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Two people close to the board said the ousted chief executive
did not deserve the money. ``The board's view is they feel badly
used by Dunlap,'' said one of the people, adding that board members
felt blind-sided by unexpectedly poor financial results during the
past and current quarters. ``They are furious, and they don't want
to pay him severance and don't believe he was straight with them on
the erosion of the numbers,'' this person said.
</P>
<P>
   If the board is successful in denying him the money, Dunlap
would be one of the few chief executives to fail at the job and not
walk away with millions anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``When companies kill the king, they at least give him a decent
burial,'' said Graef S. Crystal, a watchdog of executive pay. ``I
think they're going to have to pay him the whole thing. They don't
have any choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap, who has dismissed thousands of workers at Sunbeam, Scott
Paper and Lily-Tulip, has said that 80 percent of U.S. businesses
need to be ``Dunlapped,'' i.e. subjected to massive overhauls that
``eliminate what is not the best.'' But at Sunbeam, he got into
trouble by promising more than he could deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap could not be reached for comment, and his lawyer did not
return calls.

</P>
<P>
   Just months ago, board members and major shareholders were still
voicing support for the 60-year-old West Point-trained former
paratrooper, who arrived at Sunbeam in July 1996 to the delight of
investors. The stock rose nearly 50 percent that day and climbed to
a high of $53 this March after Dunlap proclaimed Sunbeam fixed and
said Sunbeam was ready to grow with the purchases of the makers of
Mr. Coffee machines, First Alert smoke alarms and Coleman outdoor
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   While Wall Street cheered, Dunlap repeatedly promised 20 percent
annual sales gains in an industry that was growing by only about 3
percent a year. For a time, he seemed to be pulling it off. Then,
in March, came regulatory filings that detailed how Sunbeam sold
$58 million worth of barbecue grills in December and gave retailers
until this month to pay for them. This helped Sunbeam post an
unrealistic 18 percent surge in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the indications that perhaps Dunlap had promised too
much, and the information about the one-time shot in the arm from
the barbecue grill deal.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Sunbeam warned three times this year that sales were
slowing because of an unexpected slowdown in grill sales. In
essence, the special grill deal allowed the company to borrow sales
in last year's fourth quarter for products that normally sell well
in the first and second quarters.
</P>
<P>
   On May 11, the company reported a sales drop and $44.6 million
loss, blaming the poor results in part on the special grill deal
and even El Nino. A month after the disclosure of the special grill
deal, shareholders filed lawsuits against the company and Dunlap,
contending that the early-buy program was devised to prop up the
company's numbers last year at the expense of the first quarter, so
it could secure financing for its recent acquisitions. The company
and Dunlap have denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Still, earlier this month Sunbeam said the problems related to
the grill debacle would linger into the current quarter. Then
Monday, the board said that sales have been so bad this quarter
that the company would report an operating loss for the period and
would not meet its goal of earning $1 per share for the full year
even though that amount had been revised downward several times to
account for Sunbeam's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers weren't happening, and the explanation of why it
happened didn't really wash,'' said Charles M. Elson, a
Dunlap-appointed board member who made the motion to dismiss him.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting at the Waldorf-Astoria last Tuesday, the board
asked Dunlap to explain the company's recent poor performance. ``He
said it was a transition year and don't expect a lot,'' Elson said.
That surprising statement, Elson said, sealed Dunlap's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said at a press conference two weeks earlier that we would
earn 5 cents to 10 cents a share'' for the second quarter, Elson
said. ``If you are going to assure people of results, you've got to
meet the result, and when it became clear to us he wasn't going to
be making the results, that called into question his ability to
execute the long-term strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since shortly after he arrived, Dunlap's critics have complained
that he stuffed the pipeline with a high volume of goods to boost
sales, a claim that he had angrily denied. But in a conference call
with financial analysts on Monday, the board confirmed that part of
Sunbeam's problem stems from ``pushing to make aggressive sales
objectives over the past several months.'' As a result, retailers
had too many Sunbeam grills, electric blankets and blenders.
</P>
<P>
   One of Dunlap's earliest missteps may have been purchasing
Coleman. He apparently miscalculated what buying Coleman from Ron
Perleman in exchange for stock would do to his control. Because
now, just three months later, the company is in the hands of Levin,
a close associate of Perleman's, and Dunlap is out.
</P>
<P>
   Four board members _ Elson, Howard G. Kristol, William T. Rutter
and Faith Whittlesey _ are Dunlap appointees. They will remain on
the board, but Russell A. Kersh, a longtime Dunlap aide who is
Sunbeam's vice chairman and chief financial officer, is expected to
be fired, according to one person close to the board.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam also said the company would appoint three additional
board members, including a representative of Frankin Mutual and two
representing MacAndrews &AMP; Forbes. They will be Levin and Howard
Gittis, vice chairman of MacAndres &AMP; Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The company said its three operating officers would continue to
run the company and report to Levin.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap's own words might also have come back to haunt him if the
board took them to heart. In his book, which he promoted as
aggressively as Sunbeam promotes its toasters, Dunlap wrote: ``My
pay should be compared to superstars in other fields, not to the
average CEO. Only a handful of chief executives are worth the big
bucks they are paid. Many are grossly overpaid and should be fired
and then replaced by CEOs whose pay is strictly
performance-based.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sunbeam board apparently agreed.

JORDAN PROVES IT TAKES MORE THAN LEGS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY, Utah _ The pull-up jump shot, once a fundamental
basketball staple, reminded us Sunday night that while Michael
Jordan has dominated the Generation X 1990s, his career began in an
era that looked very different from this one. When Jordan used his
left shoulder and hand to force the defender Bryon Russell to move
left, then backward, he was dating himself as a player who did not
grow up with 24-hour cable networks, with continuous reels of
3-point shots and frantic assaults on a pliable rim.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was once more breathtaking than any of today's young
fliers, but never averse to learning a few subtle tricks in the
gym. The Jordan of a decade ago would have elevated and levitated
over Russell for the shot that closed out the Utah Jazz, that
raised the Chicago Bulls' sixth championship flag in the last eight
years. The 35-year-old and more earthbound Jordan needed to clear
enough space, cross over on the dribble, square up and shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the 40 percent series shooting, the 20 shots he missed in
44 exhausting minutes of his 103rd game of the season. Today's
typical player can't even get a decent shot under these
circumstances, and this one was for the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got the ball, I looked up and saw 18.5 seconds left,''
he said, setting up the game winner with 5.2 seconds left that gave
him 45 points and the Bulls an 87-86 victory at the Delta Center.
``I felt we couldn't call a timeout. It was do or die. John
Stockton was on the right side with Steve Kerr, and he couldn't
gamble, and as Russell reached, he gave me a clear lane. I made my
initial drive, he bit, and I stopped, pulled up, great look.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan managed to edit out his use of the left shoulder and
hand, though there were the usual news media cries that in a more
democratic basketball society, it would have been an offensive
foul. Conversely, the contact was precipitated by Russell's
reaching, which Jordan exploited, as he did against the same player
in a similar Game 1 situation during last year's finals. Russell
committed the cardinal defensive sin, not staying balanced, feet
uncrossed. By the time Jordan was in the air, Russell may as well
have been in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see these young guys come in the league with the great
legs and they think that's all it takes,'' said the Bulls reserve
Scott Burrell, Jordan's practice opposite. ``But it doesn't really
help you until you learn how to play the game. Physical talent will
help you to a certain extent, but not at crunch time.''
</P>
<P>
   This might have been the synopsis for another playoff season
when the popular coaching maxim was, ``Never trust anyone under
30.'' Three of the four semifinalists were filled with
bone-creakin', geritol-takin', retirement-contemplatin' geezers.
The fourth, Shaquille O'Neal's young Lakers, were sent to their
rooms in a four-game sweep by the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Principal players in the finals were Jordan, Scottie Pippen
(32), Dennis Rodman (37), John Stockton (36), Karl Malone (34),
Jeff Hornacek (35), Antoine Carr (37). Toni Kukoc, who turns 30 in
September, learned the game in the more grounded European system.
And yet, the dramatic Game 6 and conclusion aside, this
championship series was no artistic masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls averaged 88 points a game, the Jazz 80. The Jazz tied
the record for fewest points scored in any National Basketball
Association game with a shot clock, with 54 in Game 3. The teams'
combined 66 first-half points in Game 5 was another record low. No
team scored 100 points in any game.
</P>
<P>
   When the Knicks and the Houston Rockets played such a series in
1994, the quality of play was ridiculed. When Jordan is gone, by
next season or whenever, people will no doubt harp once again on
the inability of offenses to react smartly to double teams. The
lack of creative intermediate play. The few players who can use
their bodies to create an effective jump shot off the dribble, the
way Jordan did against Russell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we've played as esthetically pleasing a game
as we have in the past,'' Bulls Coach Phil Jackson admitted. ``But
the Bulls have become a different kind of entertainment, like a
sitcom, a story.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his wealth, all his fame, Jordan's story ultimately is
about a man with a ball in a gym. ``When I got here this season, I
was holding back at practice, thinking, `I don't want to be the one
who ends his season,''' Burrell said. ``Then they tell you, `Go at
him. The man doesn't get hurt.' But, yeah, you wonder why he has to
go so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday night, Burrell understood.

A LOSS, BUT A WIN FOR THE US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ They could have done the conservative thing, probably
the prudent thing, when they came out for the second half down a
goal to Germany. They could have replaced attackers with defenders,
thrown up a wall and kicked Jurgen Klinsmann in the ankle a few
dozen times. The US soccer team could have done what they did four
years ago when faced with a superior team _ played not to lose.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans don't play that way anymore. ``We will play to
win,'' coach Steve Sampson has said a hundred times since he got
the job three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And so the US did in its World Cup opener Monday night, even
after its worst nightmare _ giving up a goal in the eighth minute _
came true. The Americans settled their nerves and swallowed hard
and kept coming. They nearly tied the match in the 53d minute on
Frankie Hejduk's diving header.
</P>
<P>
   When Sampson went to his bench in the second half, for Hejduk
and Roy Wegerle and Tab Ramos, he went for offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to equalize, and then to go ahead,'' Sampson
said. ``Not to conserve a 1-0 result.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead it ended up 2-0 when the Germans counterattacked and
Klinsmann, the man with the golden foot, shook himself loose from
Thomas Dooley and put the ball by Kasey Keller.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe 10 days from now, if the US fails to advance because of
goal differential, playing to win Monday night will come back to
haunt it. But if they hadn't, the Yanks would never have known,
truly, where they stand on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   They can, and have, beaten heavyweights like Brazil and
Argentina and England in Copa Americas and Gold Cups and US Cups.
But what they need to know _ and their fans need to know _ is
whether, after a decade of taking the sport seriously, the US can
play straight up against the best teams in the world when
everyone's playing for the world's biggest prize.
</P>
<P>
   They had that chance four years ago when they met eventual
champion Brazil in the second round before a full house in the Rose
Bowl and Bora Milutinovic, Sampson's predecessor, played it safe.
The Americans lost only 1-0 _ a perfectly good result _ but didn't
take a shot on goal. Could they have won if they'd risked more? Or
would they have been humiliated? Nobody knows, then or now.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night in the Parc des Princes, we got some answers.
Sampson's squad took on the European champions, a team loaded with
renowned (if aging) players like Klinsmann and Thomas Haessler and
Andreas Moeller and Juergen Kohler that has much to prove here
after their quarterfinal exit last time.
</P>
<P>
   With a bit of luck _ if Moeller's seeing-eye header hadn't
squeezed between Mike Burns's hip and the post and if Hejduk's ball
had gone in _ the US might have had a draw. Truth is, the Germans
are two goals better than the Americans on most nights and the
Americans won't argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their 22 are better than our 22,'' Ramos said before he and
his mates even crossed the Atlantic. ``If they play their best and
we play our best, they win.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither team was at its best Monday night. The Americans were
jittery and tentative until the second half; the Germans developed
attention deficit after going up so easily so early. But even
though the US has narrowed the technical gap on the Germans, the
essential difference remains: The Germans can almost always get the
result they want; the Americans have to hope for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw how simple it is for the Germans to win games,'' said
US captain Thomas Dooley, who was a German citizen until six years
ago and played a dozen years in the pro leagues there. ``They keep
possession all over the field. They don't make any mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Germans knew exactly what they needed Monday night _ not
merely a victory but a couple of goals difference in the plus
column, just in case they end up tying the Yugoslavs Sunday. And
they knew exactly how to get it. Knock US playmaker Claudio Reyna
off the ball every time he touched it. Stretch the defense by
knocking the ball around and probing, probing, probing for soft
spots. And make the Americans pay immediately _ and dearly _ for
every lapse.
</P>
<P>
   Moeller's goal might have seemed fluky, but it came because
David Regis and Ernie Stewart let Klinsmann escape from their
sandwich and get his head on a corner kick and because Moeller
slipped his mark. Klinsmann's goal came because the Americans lost
the ball going forward, because Oliver Bierhoff beat Eddie Pope
down the side and got off a cross, and because Dooley lost
Klinsmann in close.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans might be the oldest team here (L'Equipe, the French
sporting daily, said they were dinosaurs who played at Jurassic
Park des Princes), but most of them have played hundreds of matches
at cutthroat levels. They may have played ragged, uninspired soccer
in qualifying to get here, but they got here, as they have 14
times.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans have won three Cups, reached five of the last eight
finals and never failed to make the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a good team,'' said Pope. ``They don't go out and win
tournaments for no reason.''
</P>
<P>
   In their hearts, the Americans knew they had little chance to
win Monday night. They admitted openly that they would be thrilled
with a draw. Even a 1-0 loss, Sampson had said, would be an
acceptable result.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between last time and this time is that the Yanks
were not playing for a 1-0 loss. They were playing to see where
they stand. The US federation has already announced a bold plan
(the Europeans think it's a pipedream) to win the Cup by 2010. They
can't get there by playing not to lose to teams like Brazil and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans in soccer are like the Croats and Lithuanians were
in 1992, playing the Dream Team and craving to determine how big
the gap really is. Twenty points? Forty? Eighty? Five years ago,
the US played two games against the Germans. They lost the first,
4-3, the second, 3-0, and hadn't played them since.
</P>
<P>
   How close are they now? Decidedly closer, German coach Berti
Vogts reckoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear the Americans have learned a tremendous amount,''
he said. ``They have made great strides. There are simply no poor
cousins around anymore, no easy matches. That is certainly the case
with the Americans.''

GOALIE OSGOOD HOLDS THE KEY TO DETROIT SWEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They go to the movies all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a lot of bad movies,'' confessed Detroit backup
goaltender Kevin Hodson, who attends the flicks with starting
netminder Chris Osgood.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more recent releases the two took in was
``Godzilla.'' Coincidentally, that's the nickname of Washington
goaltender Olaf Kolzig. To this point in the Stanley Cup playoffs,
Kolzig has received most of the ink and attention, while Osgood has
been viewed more as a cog in the wheel of a very powerful Red Wings
team. But Tuesday night, Osgood will be in the position of leading
his club to the Stanley Cup if Detroit can complete the four-game
sweep at the MCI Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kolzig is a great goalie,'' said Hodson. ``He hadn't really
done much up to this point, but I think this year he's really
emerged as the No. 1 goalie and deservedly so. He's got a name like
Godzilla, it's a catchy nickname and people like it. Ozzie's kind
of quiet, with a more laidback demeanor, more so than Kolzig is.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways I think it helps. All the hype before was on
(Dallas goalie Eddie) Belfour, that Eddie the Eagle was going to
fly high and all these different things. Nothing was said about
Chris. I think one of the great advantages for him as an athlete
and as a goalie is maybe teams take him a little bit lightly or
really don't respect him as much as they should.''
</P>
<P>
   Osgood, who was backup to Mike Vernon last year when the Wings
captured the Cup, goes into Tuesday night with a 15-6 record, 2.17
goals against average, and .916 save percentage in the playoffs.
Kolzig is 12-8, with a 1.86 GAA and .943 save percentage.
</P>
<P>
   As good as Osgood is, he has been considered suspect at times
because of the long-range goals he's given up. Most notably, he
gave up one to Jeremy Roenick from the blue line in the Phoenix
series. But he won the next three games to end it. In the second
round, he gave up a center-ice goal to St. Louis defenseman Al
MacInnis with less than a minute left to send the game into
overtime _ but Osgood went on to win again. Against Dallas, Jamie
Langenbrunner scored from 90 feet to win Game 5 in overtime, but
Osgood shut out the Stars to end the series in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   When Osgood has been brilliant, often he explains it away by
saying he has a great team in front of him. When he gives up the
odd suspect goal, he's considered a not-ready-for-prime-time
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing is, people say Grant Fuhr is a great goalie
and he ended up winning five Cups but the Edmonton teams he played
in front of were dynasties,'' said Hodson. ``Any time you win the
Stanley Cup, you have to have a great team in front of you. That's
just a fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of laugh at that when people say these guys are good
because of the team in front of him. The team is good because the
goaltending provides a consistency and confidence in his teammates.
Yeah, there's talent on this team and yeah, you should be
successful most years, but you need good goaltending to keep you in
there and Chris has done that, day in and day out.''
</P>
<P>
   Osgood is 25 years old but looks much younger. His blond hair,
blue eyes, and slight frame belie his deep-seated competitive
spirit. He feels, as many others do, that he finally could banish
all the doubters with one more victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take away anything from what happened last year,'' he
said. ``I enjoyed everything about last year, the experience and
winning. Obviously when you play more, it means a little more. I
didn't enjoy not playing (last year) but I accepted it and had a
great time winning the Cup last year but it would be a little more
gratifying this year.''
</P>
<P>
   This ending could be like the one the real Godzilla meets. In
the movie, the big guy gets it in the end. If the script stays the
same here, Osgood will slay all the monsters, too.

<P>
   PARIS _ Soap opera viewers in the US might not have noticed the
scheduling changes caused by the World Cup Monday, at least for the
first half of Germany's 2-0 victory over the US.
</P>
<P>
   All My Children was among the shows preempted by ABC-TV to
screen the match. But the US national team might have been part of
an episode for the show, its players picked apart in a men vs. boys
contest. The US has a chance to recover when it meets Iran in Lyon
Saturday, but there was little evidence the players are ready for
prime time -- or even for midday ratings.
</P>
<P>
   They were taught a severe lesson by the Germans, who used
defensive midfielder Jens Jeremies to take Claudio Reyna out of the
game, and took control early when Andreas Moeller slipped a header
past Revolution defender Mike Burns off the post in the 10th
minute, then coasted.
</P>
<P>
   Inhibition, stage fright, plus Germany's precision, were a
recipe for disaster similar to the US' even more devastating 5-1
loss to Czechoslovakia in the debut during the 1990 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   But the US nearly capitalized on the Germans' lethargy, and came
within inches of tying the score on Frankie Hejduk's second-half
header, before succumbing to Jurgen Klinsmann's finish midway
through the half.
</P>
<P>
   Had Hejduk not been thwarted by goalkeeper Andreas Kopke, the US
and its numerous supporters at the Parc des Princes would have been
rejuvenated. But the US needed more to rally than Hejduk's
enthusiasm and speed, and a late injection of offense from Tab
Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We defended with too many people,'' Ramos said. ``We didn't go
forward at all and it is very hard to win a game if you don't go
forward. If you go forward you can still lose to Germany, 2-0. I am
very disappointed. We looked like we did in 1990 in the first
half.''
</P>
<P>
   US coach Steve Sampson left much of the team's experience out.
Marcelo Balboa and Ramos were on the bench, and their teammate
during the Italy '90 debacle, John Harkes, had been cut. Alexi
Lalas and Preki remained on the bench and Roy Wegerle only entered
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson used three defenders, plus three defensive midfielders,
in an attempt to stifle German strikers Klinsmann and Olivier
Bierhoff. The strategy seemed reasonable, especially with Kasey
Keller in goal. But the tactic not only failed, it negatively
affected the mentality of the players. For the US players, it was
almost impossible to adjust their defensive mindset.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played very well at the start, but after it was 1-0, the
Americans began to play more offensive, more aggressively,'' German
defender Stefan Reuter said. ``But we never felt we were going to
lose this game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Germans choreographed the pace from the start, and they did
so from the back line. Jurgen Kohler, Olaf Thon, and Christian
Worns had little to do defensively, as the US used only one
striker. This allowed Germany time on the ball, and the Mannschaft
methodically carved up the US defense. Germany's attacking
midfielders measured their angles, and the attackers picked their
spots.
</P>
<P>
   After Moeller's goal, Germany starting preparing for Sunday's
game against Yugoslavia in Lens. They had solved the US scheme and
seemed capable of scoring again, if necessary. There was no call
for the Germans to extend themselves or to reveal any more than
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the US went all out in the second half. Hejduk, who
replaced Burns, added spark on the right side and narrowly missed
tying the game with a header past Kohler in the 10th minute.
Striker Eric Wynalda helped set up the play by laying off to
defender David Regis, who crossed to Hejduk.
</P>
<P>
   But the US began leaving spaces in an attempt to score. And
Germany capitalized. Jeremies set up the second goal by dribbling
past two US players, then powering through David Regis; Bierhoff
crossed to Klinsmann, who chested down as Dooley overran the play,
then lofted a shot into the far corner of the net for a two-goal
edge.
</P>
<P>
   There were other US bright spots. Eddie Pope stifled Bierhoff,
leading scorer in Italy's Serie A with Udinese last season. Keller,
who emerged on the international scene in a 1-0 win over Brazil in
February, was poised.
</P>
<P>
   But there were also other miscalculations, especially in
preparation. The US had taken a 3-0 victory over Austria in Vienna
in April, but then was unimpressive against Kuwait and failed to
win two other home matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat Brazil because Kasey had the game of his life, but
they killed us,'' Ramos said. ``We played well against Austria and
we thought they would compare to Germany. But we just showed them
too much respect.''

 &HT;    Two jewelers still wait for reward
 &HT;    By R. Robin McDonald
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shawn Slep, Chamblee, Ga. jeweler and artisan, hoped
heiress Kathleen DuRoss Ford would invite him to her Palm Beach,
Fla., mansion.
</P>
<P>
   He expected, at the very least, a thank you note along with his
share of a $1 million reward for helping the FBI recover Ford's
stolen jewels.
</P>
<P>
   But five months after Slep and his business partner, Randy
Jones, led the FBI to Florida jewelry dealer Barry Marshall and a
cache of gems stolen in a $7.5 million heist from Ford's home, they
have heard nothing from either Ford or her attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed and disgusted, Slep said, ``Now, we just want the
reward.''
</P>
<P>
   More than $2 million of Ford's jewelry collection stolen in the
January 1997 burglary is now in police hands. Marshall and Alvaro
Valdez, a man identified by authorities as the burglar of the Ford
estate, have pleaded guilty to federal charges associated with the
interstate transport of the stolen gems.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ford's West Palm Beach attorney, Frank Chopin, said
Monday there's a good reason why Ford has not paid the $1 million
reward.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement authorities in Florida have never returned any
of the recovered jewels to Ford, Chopin said. Nearly $5 million of
Ford's jewels are still missing.
</P>
<P>
   And, according to Florida prosecutors and Palm Beach police, the
investigation into a string of Florida burglaries that netted more
than $40 million in jewels from some of the wealthiest people on
the Florida coast remains open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an active case,'' said Janet Kinsella, spokeswoman for
the Palm Beach Police Department. ``We are pursuing additional
leads. There likely will be another arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have yet to formally charge anyone with the burglary of
Ford's Palm Beach mansion, Chopin said, an assertion that Kinsella
confirmed. State prosecutors intend to file charges within the next
60 days, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is willing to assume that Mr. Valdez is, in fact, the
burglar,'' Chopin said. ``He has not been charged yet (with the
burglary). He has not been convicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Any suggestion that Ford does not intend to pay the reward once
the case is resolved is both irresponsible and offensive, Chopin
said. ``It suggests that somehow Mrs. Ford is not honorable.
There's no bad faith. There's no reluctance to honor her
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The two jewelers became entangled in what one called the
recovery of ``the hottest jewels on the planet'' in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, a dealer Jones had known for years, brought an antique
emerald surrounded by 12 small diamonds to him to sell on
consignment, Jones said. He also shipped three other diamonds, one
larger than four carats, for Slep to fashion into a platinum ring,
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the potential buyers to whom Jones showed the stunning
emerald was Jeff Meyer, an Atlanta jewelry dealer. Meyer spotted
photos of the stolen Ford collection on the Internet along with the
notice of the $1 million reward. Meyer, with whom Slep and Jones
plan to share the reward, alerted Jones that the emerald might have
once been part of a stolen necklace that once belonged to Henry
Ford.
</P>
<P>
   After comparing the emerald and the diamonds they said Marshall
had left with them to the Ford photos, Jones and Slep called the
FBI. Thus began an investigation that swept the two small-town
jewelers in an Atlanta suburb into the hunt for jewel thieves.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall was arrested outside their Chamblee, Ga. shop on Dec.
11, 1997, as he was allegedly delivering additional pieces of the
necklace to sell. Acting on information from Marshall, authorities
in Florida later arrested Valdez, who police said had sold pieces
of Ford's collection to Marshall for cut-rate prices behind a
Florida doughnut shop.
</P>
<P>
   Although they were afraid of Marshall and his then-unknown
partners in crime, Jones and Slep cooperated with the FBI and Palm
Beach police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized this piece (the antique emerald necklace) was
being chopped up and once it was, it could never be put back
together again,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my little fairy tale world, I wanted to put it (the
necklace) back together or just see it,'' said Slep, who began
cutting gems as a jeweler's apprentice when he was only 13. ``Then
we just wanted to meet her. Then we just wanted a thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinsella said that Slep and Jones ``helped us considerably. If
we had a reward to give, we would certainly consider them worthy of
it. ... But this reward was offered by Mrs. Ford and her attorneys.
We have no say in who gets it or when.''

 &HT;    South's leaders see high-tech future
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ In a conference plotting the future of the
South, leaders urged communities across the region _ from backwoods
to big city, from poor to prosperous _ to embrace technology with
one arm and hug their children with the other.
</P>
<P>
   The wide-ranging recommendations emerging from a 76-page draft
report by the 1998 Commission on the Future of the South,
concluding its meeting today, illustrate the breadth of the
region's problems _ and the challenges of fixing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would suggest that no other generation of Southerners has
been in such a promising position,'' former Kentucky Gov. Martha
Layne Collins, the commission's chairman, told Monday's conference.
But she added, ``If you have low skills, you face a bleak future,
and it is getting bleaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky's current governor, Paul Patton, warned that if the
South fails to nurture children as tomorrow's work force and to
embrace technology, the region risks losing its economic momentum.
``If we do it right, we can make a quantum leap in our effort to
catch up'' with the rest of America, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When adopted in final form at an Aug. 30-Sept. 1 meeting in San
Juan, Puerto Rico, the report will serve as a blueprint that the
commission hopes state legislatures, local governments and other
groups will use in economic development.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take one lesson in economic development away from this
report, it should be this: In the years ahead, effective education
for everyone will drive our economy, and effective education begins
with a family and their children before birth,'' the commission
said in the draft report.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the gaps to be overcome, the commission expressed
hope that ``virtually all students will be able to read by grade
four.'' To help rescue at-risk children from a lifetime of trouble,
the report recommends that the region replace its patchwork of day
care with ``preschool universally available by 2003'' and mandatory
full-day kindergarten by 2000. The gap between the haves and
have-nots is growing, despite the region's broad economic and
social gains of the past quarter century, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   Global manufacturers with the prestige of Mercedes-Benz and BMW
have created thousands of jobs, but more than one in five of the
South's children live in poverty, the commission said. The region
has nine of America's 10 most depressed counties, where, in the
worst cases, more than six in 10 children live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Convened once every six years by the Southern Growth Policies
Board of Research Triangle Park, N.C., the commission is a
blue-ribbon panel of governors and other leaders from 14 states and
Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, the meetings have served as a national
springboard for politicians, including two governors, Jimmy Carter
of Georgia and Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who became president.
</P>
<P>
   This week's meeting focused on the future, but also touched on
the legacy of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only have we suffered because of the innate inhumanity of
that act, we (also have) suffered because of the war that it took
to eliminate it,'' Patton said. ``We have continued to suffer
because of the injustices that continue to permeate our society.''
</P>
<P>
   The remark surprised but encouraged Veronica Biggins, an Atlanta
executive recruiter and former Clinton staffer who serves on the
Future of the South Commission.
</P>
<P>
   She's pushing, she said, for the draft report to be amended to
reflect more strongly the region's growing diversity.

FOR SELLERS TO JAPANESE, WORSE AHEAD

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Japanese yen continued its slide toward the abyss on
Monday, stock markets around the world trembled. So much for the
idea that Asian problems could be contained.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of many big multinational companies that do business in
Asia fell Monday on fears that declining sales there would hurt
profits. Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, for example, lost 6.7
percent of its value. IBM was down 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But share prices of some companies with large exposures to
Japan's incredible shrinking economy do not yet reflect the dark
reality of what is happening there. Yes, these companies' shares
have fallen, but they are likely to fall further in coming weeks as
the bleak news sinks in.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses with big Japanese exposure range from Tiffany &AMP; Co.,
the elite New York-based jeweler that produces 27 percent of its
sales in Japan, to the discount retailer Toys ``R'' Us, which has
111 stores _ one-tenth of its worldwide total _ in the Pacific Rim.
The company has 64 stores in Japan alone.
</P>
<P>
   Other players in Japan include Aflac Inc., a life insurance
concern based in Columbus, Ga., which generates 60 percent of its
earnings in Japan. Particularly hard hit is Nu Skin, a marketer of
personal-care and nutrition products that gets 70 percent of its
revenue from Japanese operations.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmetics makers are also vulnerable: Estee Lauder generated 13
percent of its operating income from the region; 16 percent of Avon
Products' sales and 10 percent of its pretax income come from the
Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Japan is the largest market for Gucci, the
luxury-goods retailer. And LVMH, the Parisian purveyor of
high-class perfume, luggage, Champagne and Cognac, reported that
sales fell 30 percent through May at its duty-free goods unit as
Japanese customers cut back on travel.
</P>
<P>
   The setback in Japan is a paradox for the American companies
that battled for years to penetrate the country's relatively closed
consumer society. Because Japan was willing to open its borders
only to some, not all foreign companies, it may not be immediately
obvious to investors which companies will be hurt most by problems
there now. The companies that never broke through Japan's barriers
can now count their blessings.
</P>
<P>
   The damage is not limited to companies that do business in
Japan. The entire Pacific Rim looks like poison. The yen is
dragging down currencies elsewhere in Asia, in places like South
Korea, Indonesia and Hong Kong, as it falls in value.
</P>
<P>
   Companies with significant operations in Japan and elsewhere in
the Pacific Rim are reeling from a double punch. First, sales of
goods made overseas generally decline when a nation's local
currency is in a free fall; that's because the currency's lower
value makes foreign goods more expensive there than they once were.
</P>
<P>
   The second punch comes when these companies repatriate earnings
made in a country whose currency is weak to one with a strong
currency _ in this case, the dollar. Although these companies try
to hedge their currency risks, almost no one had predicted that the
yen _ down 8.5 percent against the dollar since May 15 _ would drop
so steeply.
</P>
<P>
   Many company managers with exposure overseas say they will make
up any shortfall there by stepping up operations elsewhere. For
example, Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, told the French
business weekly Le Journal des Finances, that the company would
expand in the United States to offset slowing sales in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But it takes a long time to build businesses. Any
increases that LVMH and other companies hope to generate from new
or expanded markets will not be evident for several quarters. Sales
declines, on the other hand, can happen overnight, especially in a
country whose currency _ the yen in this case _ has fallen almost 4
percent in the last week alone.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts remain mostly sanguine about these
companies' prospects. That's no surprise, given how hard it is for
executives to dispense bad news. And many analysts, perhaps waiting
for the yen to stabilize, have not updated their estimates to take
into account the its recent tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   Arnault of LVMH, for example, at last week's shareholder
meeting, said it remained his objective for the company to report a
profit rise in 1998. But his hopes are pinned on a yen value of 130
to the dollar, not the current 146.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason these shares have not crumbled further: Investors
may think Japan's problems are temporary _ a dangerous view. Craig
Chudler, Japanese market strategist at Salomon Smith Barney,
expects the gross domestic product in Japan to contract 1.5 percent
this year, more than double last year's decline of 0.7 of 1
percent. Continued weakness in Japan's stock market, down 1.3
percent Monday, will make consumers there even more likely to cut
back on discretionary spending.
</P>
<P>
   With some of these stocks down, they may look cheap. But with
few willing to predict how low the yen can sink, and with the
Japanese government doing little to address its problems, this is
no time for bottom-fishing.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Broderbund To Put Itself Up for Sale  
   
 By Julia Angwin  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Broderbund, the struggling Novato software-maker, tacitly
acknowledged yesterday that it is for sale.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rumors about an acquisition of Broderbund have been swirling for
months and were confirmed yesterday when Broderbund said it had
hired investment banking firm Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette to
``explore strategic alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's usually a euphemism for being up for sale,'' said
Stephen Dube, an analyst at Wasserstein Perella Securities in New
York. ``The company has been for sale for a while _ this is just a
public admission of that fact.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Broderbund announced it would not meet Wall
Street's expectations for third-quarter sales. The news drove the
price of Broderbund shares down $2.81 to $17.38.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were expecting Broderbund to earn 1 cent per share, or
about $200,000 in the third quarter. Instead, the company said it
will likely lose 12 to 15 cents per share, or $2.5 million to $3.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund blames its third-quarter woes on a large number of
returns and the need to match competitors rebates _ some rivals
were offering customers rebates on the entire price of a software
package.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; This is the latest setback for Broderbund, which is the last
well-known independent maker of entertainment software. The company
is known for high-quality titles such as Myst and Where in the
World is Carmen Sandiego? but has been suffering from price wars
and consolidation in the entertainment software market.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Broderbund lost $13 million on sales of $190 million in 1997,
after two years of earning $36 million on similar sales of between
$170 to $180 million. The company laid off 7 percent of its
workforce in March.
</P>
<P>
   Some analyst say the company's problems may stem from bad
management _ particularly Broderbund chief executive Joe Durrett,
who continues to live in Connecticut while running the California
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a company that five years ago was far and away the top
dog in this industry and it's been allowed to deteriorate,'' said
David Farina, analyst at William Blair &AMP; Co. in Chicago
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund officials did not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors about Broderbund being for sale began two weeks ago
when Computer Retail Week reported that the interactive division of
toymaker Hasbro, based in Pawtucket, R.I., was considering buying
Broderbund.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, possible buyers cited have included Electronic Arts,
a San Mateo game-maker; The Learning Company, a Boston-based
educational software rival; and GT Interactive Software, a New York
software conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   By aligning with one of these giants, analysts say Broderbund
would have more leverage to convince retailers to stock its
software and could better withstand price competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broderbund has really good brands _ they just aren't being
managed well enough,'' said Aaron Ricadela, associate editor at
Computer Retail Week in Jericho, NY.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analysts think that other companies, such as Hasbro
Interactive, would be a lot better at managing the assets that
Broderbund has been fumbling recently,'' Ricadela said.

 &HT;    Woman may be forced to give up ``hobby'' of living with 20 cats
 &HT;    By Scott Cech
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ To Johnette Lothrop's way of thinking,
the city of Port St. Lucie is telling her to suddenly quit her
abiding hobby and kick 20 of her closest friends out of her house.
Or else.
</P>
<P>
   Along with her husband Robert, Lothrop lives with about 20 Maine
Coon cats, which she said she breeds, shows and occasionally sells
to help recoup the costs of keeping the cats.
</P>
<P>
   But the city has told her that anyone housing more than three
adult cats is running a de facto kennel, and no kennels are allowed
in residential districts.
</P>
<P>
   So Lothrop has been reluctantly giving away her pride of cats,
all of which have names.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put it politely, I'm pissed,'' she said. ``But I can't
fight city hall on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   When she and her husband moved into their suburban home two
years ago, she said, she consulted the city's animal control
officers about local regulations and has kept the animals clean and
well-fed. They have to be, she said, to compete in hobbyists' cat
shows she enters more than once a month. Ribbons from the shows
decorate a wall in the home.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, city code enforcement officials said, Lothrop's
feline stewardship is more than just a hobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hobby is not something you get compensated for,'' said Mary
Mastro, an administrative assistant in the occupational licensing
division of the city's Building Department. She said
advertisements, such as those Lothrop has placed to sell the
occasional cat as a pet, put Lothrop in a category different than
the average cat owner.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the scale of sales, Mastro said, ``If you put a
product or a service out there and you get compensated for it,
you're no different from Wal-mart.''
</P>
<P>
   But that argument cuts no ice with Lothrop.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a business,'' she said. ``If it was a business I'd
be making money.'' Even with the cats' value _ up to $1,000 for a
good purebred breeding cat, she said _ Lothrop estimates she loses
$5,000 to $10,000 per year keeping up with the cats' needs. That
includes food, vaccination, veterinary and insurance costs, as well
as cat-show entrance fees and other costs.
</P>
<P>
   Even giving the cats away is expensive, she said, pointing to
the $170-per-cat air fare she's paying to ship them to breeders she
knows.
</P>
<P>
   Lothrop said the city told her to write a letter promising to
get rid of the cats or face the judgment of the city's code board
at its July 8 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Ridsdale, the city's neighborhood services coordinator,
said the board could impose fines of $10 to $250 per day.
</P>
<P>
   But that's nothing compared to the emotional cost of losing her
cats, Lothrop said. She wiped away a tear as she recalled having to
give up a 4-month-old kitten she had to give up recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even now it still bothers me that he's gone,'' she said,
surrounded on her couch by stretching, sleeping and frolicking
cats. ``You get attached to these guys.''

STARR RENEWS HIS CRITICISM OF MAGAZINE ARTICLE ABOUT LEAKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr renewed his attacks Monday on a
magazine article that said he and at least one subordinate had
improperly disclosed to reporters sensitive information about his
investigation of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In his second statement about the matter in three days, Starr
challenged the accuracy of the article, by the veteran journalist
Steven Brill, saying it ``created a serious misimpression of the
operation and policy'' of the independent counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   Brill wrote in his new magazine, Brill's Content, that Starr and
one of his deputies, Jackie Bennett, had given reporters
information _ including accounts by witnesses who were to appear
before a grand jury _ regarding the investigation into whether
Clinton had engaged in a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky,
a former White House intern, and then encouraged her to lie about
it under oath.
</P>
<P>
   In his first statement, on Saturday evening, Starr challenged
Brill's conclusions but did not take issue with any of the
article's facts. He insisted that disclosures from his office were
neither illegal, since they did not involve testimony before a
grand jury, nor a violation of ethics rules barring leaks of
``substantive'' information about a prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The statement Starr issued on Monday said his office ``does not
release grand jury material either directly or indirectly, on the
record or off the record.'' The statement went on to say that his
office ``does not release (and has never released) information
provided by witnesses during witness interviews, except as
authorized by law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Brill's statements to the contrary,'' Starr continued,
``are false.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr did acknowledge that his office had released information
concerning its initial interview with Ms. Lewinsky. But he said
this information concerned merely the ``circumstances'' and not the
substance of that encounter and had been meant to rebut inaccurate
information about prosecutors' conduct at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our limited disclosure,'' he said, ``was entirely appropriate
and dictated by Department of Justice policy to counter a serious,
yet unfounded, allegation of misconduct _ namely that Ms. Lewinsky
was illegally detained and coerced during the interview.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, William Ginsburg, who was then Ms. Lewinsky's
lawyer, charged that Starr had lured her to a hotel in Virginia
and, ``with the help of four or five FBI agents and three or four
U.S. attorneys, managed to detain her _ although she was
technically free to go _ for eight or nine hours without an
attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Starr's office gave at least one reporter, Susan
Schmidt of The Washington Post, a detailed account of the
circumstances that day. That account, in Ms. Schmidt's words,
depicted Starr's conduct ``as far less hostile.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's statement on Monday appeared to be an effort to quiet a
chorus of criticism, most of it from Clinton's supporters, that has
been spawned by the article in Brill's Content. Still, while his
statement said his disclosures were ``authorized by law'' or
``dictated by Department of Justice Policy,'' it did not specify
what he regarded as the relevant statute or policy guideline.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure make it a crime for
anyone, including ``an attorney for the government,'' to disclose
events occurring before a grand jury. In May, the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said that rule also
includes the release of ``matters which will occur'' before the
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In his article, Brill quoted Starr as saying that providing
information to reporters would not violate federal law if the
material was merely statements that witnesses made to federal
agents before testifying before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office did not respond to several messages on Monday
seeking further elaboration on his written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Other than referring to Ms. Schmidt's article, Starr's statement
does not specifically address other allegations made by Brill that
Starr had leaked sensitive information to reporters. Among the
reporters that Brill said Starr and his lieutenant had briefed _ an
allegation Starr had confirmed in the Brill article _ were Michael
Isikoff of Newsweek and Jackie Judd of ABC News.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In other developments on Monday, the White House filed a brief
asking a federal appeals court to sharply limit the the questioning
of a deputy counsel, Bruce Lindsey, by investigators. A federal
district court ruled last month that Clinton's claim of
attorney-client privilege could not shield Lindsey, one of the
president's closest aides, from grand jury questioning.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is seeking to reverse that decision. Lindsey's
discussions with several important witnesses, including Vernon
Jordan, is of particular interest to the investigators, according
to a sealed opinion by the Federal District judge in the case,
Norma Holloway Johnson.

RUSSIA SCOLDS U.S. GENERAL OVER NATO AIR EXERCISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a blunt dressing down, Russia's defense minister
told the top United States military commander Monday that Moscow
had been misled over the timing of NATO's air exercises in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism underscored the differences between Russia and the
Western alliance on the eve of a critical meeting here between
President Boris Yeltsin and Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav
president.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev made the complaint at his meeting
with Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton sought to play down the dispute, saying both sides
shared the goal of bringing peace to Kosovo. Still, the
disagreement pointed to the underlying tensions over the province.
</P>
<P>
   As a traditional ally of the Serbs, Russia has been more
sympathetic to Belgrade's position. And as a nation with its own
share of ethnic conflicts, Russia does not want to legitimize the
principle that outside powers can intervene on humanitarian and
security grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton outlined the differences to reporters on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that Milosevic needs to move out first,'' the general
said, ``because he is the one that we have seen use excessive force
in Kosovo. We have concerns about the techniques that are being
used to put down, to squelch the uprising.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian position, he said, is that ``Milosevic has the right
to use whatever force he needs to put them down.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone call Monday, President Clinton urged Yeltsin to
take a firm stand with Milosevic. Specifically, Washington wants
the Russian president to stick to the points hammered out last
Friday by Western foreign ministers and the Russian foreign
minister, Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   They include stopping the Serbian crackdown against ethnic
Albanian civilians, allowing the return of refugees and
establishing a dialogue between the Serbian authorities and the
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The American hope is that if Yeltsin fails to win concessions
from Milosevic, he will support a U.N. Security Council resolution
authorizing military action against Serbia. But with Russians
publicly criticizing NATO's show of force, it is unclear whether
Yeltsin's meeting will resolve or deepen rifts within international
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev's comments Monday did little to fortify the impression
that Moscow was prepared to take a tough stand. In the post-Cold
War era, Russian military relations with the United States are
businesslike.
</P>
<P>
   But Sergeyev has shown a penchant for using his American
visitors as props in his protests against American foreign policy.
Earlier this year, Sergeyev began a meeting with Defense Secretary
William Cohen with a denunciation of American policy toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's meeting between Sergeyev and Shelton began much the
same way. The American military chief arrived in Moscow for
previously scheduled talks with Sergeyev and Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin,
chief of the Russian general staff. At the start of the meeting,
Sergeyev expressed surprise that the aerial exercises had begun so
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a soldier, and I value honesty in people most of all,''
Sergeyev said. ``I do not understand why they did this to me.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials insisted that there had been no intention to
mislead him. They say Cohen informed Sergeyev on Friday that there
would be aerial exercises and that NATO had contingency plans for
military strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the NATO meeting in Brussels last week, there was
discussion of an exercise,'' Shelton said. ``I believe Marshal
Sergeyev left earlier on Friday, and it was only after that time
that the exercise firmed up so that it would take place as rapidly
as it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev's outburst may have been intended to dispel the
impression that the timing of the exercises was coordinated with
the Kremlin to put pressure on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton indicated that the United States would not take part in
any immediate air strikes against Serbia, adding that Congress
would have to be consulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still some way from military action being taken,'' he
said.

ANALYSIS: AS JAPAN GOES, SO GOES THE NEIGHBORHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the last 10 months the Clinton administration
has warned that a full-blown recession in Japan could prove the
time bomb of the Asian crisis, setting off a sharp fall of the yen
and, in turn, a second wave of the economic contagion that is
spreading to investors around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Now that appears to be what is happening. But President
Clinton's economic advisers, weary of jawboning their Japanese
counterparts, say the United States has very little leverage
remaining over Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in internal White House arguments in recent days, some
of Clinton's advisers have argued that Japan's hidden strategy is
to let the country's currency fall _ making Japanese goods less
expensive in the United States _ even if the fall undermines other
countries in Asia that are struggling to emerge from a yearlong
nightmare, or worsens troubles in Russia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the yen's tumble is acting as something of a double
brake on other economies around the world. Japan's recession is
making it nearly impossible for other Asian nations (to say nothing
of American carmakers and other manufacturers) to export more goods
into Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the yen falls Japanese goods push out products
that other ailing Asian nations are trying to export to the United
States and Europe, particularly Korean cars, steel and
semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening in Japan is hitting all of its neighbors _
Korea, Thailand _ and it is triggering a huge amount of instability
around the world,'' Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade
representative, said in an interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked what the United States could do, Barshefsky, a
veteran of five years of trade wars with Japan that have yielded
modest changes but not the sweeping economic deregulation that
Clinton once championed so publicly, offered little new.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to keep putting pressure on them, both bilaterally and
through our allies,'' she said. At the same time she conceded that
the threat the United States has occasionally wielded in trade
disputes _ closing the American market to cars or computer chips,
for example _ would probably only accentuate Japan's troubles if
used to compel Tokyo to speed up economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In private, administration officials have long referred to Japan
as ``the last firewall'' of the Asian crisis, and contended that if
that wall were breached, it was only a matter of time before Asia's
troubles lept the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   It is an unproven thesis _ many said Korea was the firewall
during the depths of the first wave of Asian economic trouble in
December _ but clearly investors harbor the same worry. The
evidence came Monday on Wall Street, when last week's sell-off
accelerated into a 207.01-point drop in the Dow industrials,
prompted largely by news that the dollar had touched an eight-year
high against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is bound to complicate Clinton's first trip to
China, which begins next week.
</P>
<P>
   At the insistence of the Chinese, he is making no stopover in
Japan, America's strongest military ally in Asia. That deprives him
of a natural chance to drive home to a Japanese public _ one highly
critical of its own leadership _ America's prescription: rapid
deregulation and a bailout of Japan's banks modeled on the handling
of the U.S. savings and loan crisis in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton is facing accusations from the Chinese
that the United States and Japan are engaged in an economic
conspiracy to let the yen fall, creating further troubles in the
rest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are Japan and the United States letting the yen slide?''
China's state-run daily, The Financial News, which is controlled by
China's central bank, asked Monday morning. ``Mainly because a
falling yen suits the two countries' economic interests now, and is
beneficial in passing on their domestic economic problems to other
countries,'' the paper concluded.
</P>
<P>
   That commentary underscores an oft-expressed view in Asia these
days: That the United States is not unhappy with Asia in crisis,
especially as the American economy keeps charging along.
</P>
<P>
   China has long worried about American efforts to ``contain'' its
power, both military and economic. The falling yen and rising
dollar, in the view of some nationalists, are means to this end.
The currencies' shifts benefit the Japanese by making their exports
far more competitive against their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   And a strong dollar benefits American companies by making it
possible for them to snap up assets across Asia _ companies,
factories, banks _ at firesale prices. One of Asia's most voluble
nationalists, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia, warned
recently that foreign investors who bought up Asian assets were
risking a huge political backlash.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite view _ that the Asian crisis poses a rising threat
to the United States _ is voiced almost daily nowadays by Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin, even though he may have, intentionally or
not, accelerated the recent run on the yen.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again Rubin, who once supervised currency trading at
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., has repeated that the only way to strengthen
the yen is for Japan to enact the economic and market reforms the
United States has long advocated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, currencies follow fundamentals,'' he told Congress
last week. He has repeatedly infuriated Japanese officials by
refusing to threaten imminent intervention in the currency markets,
and he has not backed away from his mantra that ``a strong dollar
is in the interest of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors have interpreted those comments as a license to sell
the yen, without fear that the United States would join Japan in an
effort to bolster the yen. They are probably reading him correctly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese wasted $20 billion last month trying to intervene
to keep the yen in the 130s,'' one senior administration official
noted recently. ``Bob knows that running against the markets only
delays the fall of a currency, it can't stop it. So he wants to
pick his moment.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a fine strategy as long as the Japanese really fear the
effects of a devalued yen.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin still believes they do. He argues that although Japanese
businesses want a weak currency so that they can increase exports,
Japanese authorities are fearful that a weak yen could topple
Japanese banks that are struggling to remain solvent.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the administration, though, some officials have begun to
question whether Rubin has read the Japanese correctly.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings last week and phone conversations over the weekend,
they have begun to argue that Japanese authorities now realize they
can no longer prop up the yen _ so they might as well just let it
fall, and hope that exports will surge.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of many of Asia's economies may hinge on who is
correctly divining Japan's intentions. &QL;

 &HT;    Asian economic troubles will hurt U.S., strategist warns
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock market tumble that opened the week is expected to
continue today on fear that Asia's economic problems will hurt U.S.
corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be pleasant (this morning),'' Al Goldman,
chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons, told Dow Jones News
Service. He added, however, that the Dow is now ``deeply
oversold,'' and may be poised for an eventual move higher.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's fall in fact gave the Dow Jones industrial average its
fifth worst one-day point loss ever. The benchmark index of 30 blue
chip stocks dropped 207.01 points, or 2.3 percent, falling below
the psychologically important 8,700 level to close at 8,627.93.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Dow's worst day since Jan. 9, and the market's
broadest decline since April 27. Broader and secondary market
averages fell just shy of 2 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   The fall Monday was compounded by the fact that investors who
might normally be seeking bargains stayed out of the market with an
eye toward Asia, Dow Jones suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying problem is the year-old Asian economic malaise.
Already, corporate profits in the United States have declined in
the fourth quarter of 1997 and first quarter of 1998. And while
many analysts have anticipated a rise in second-half profits of
more than 10 percent for Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 companies, the
concern now is that Asia's continuing crisis may reduce that
increase.

GERMANY DEFEATS U.S., 2-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ After four years of undeniable improvement, of
encouraging results against top teams in lesser tournaments, the
United States learned a sober lesson Monday in a 2-0 loss to
Germany in the World Cup. When it counts, the Americans'
third-level ability still has not caught up with its first-level
ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Except for an encouraging 10-minute stretch in the second half,
the Americans were clinically dismantled by the three-time world
champions. The Germans were bigger, stronger, faster, better
organized, more purposeful and more disciplined, and more willing
to flex their considerable muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of us were a little in awe,'' said midfielder
Claudio Reyna.
</P>
<P>
   Tab Ramos, who came on in the second half in midfield, said he
had queasy flashbacks to the World Cups of 1990 and 1994, when the
nervous, timid United States played not to lose, instead of to win.
That fearful attitude was supposed to have been eradicated now that
all of the American players have experience playing in professional
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think what we saw out there was a step forward for
U.S. soccer,'' Ramos said. ``We're not here to win the World Cup
because we know that's not going to happen. But we're here to show
that we've improved, and I don't think we did a good job of that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the very first minute, German midfielder Jens Jeremies set
the tone by delivering a shot to Reyna's right kidney, sending him
down for an eight-count. Every time Reyna touched the ball, the
Germans tried to knock him off. Reyna was completely taken out of
his game, and without a steady playmaker, the U.S. attack
surrendered meekly in midfield to the German press.
</P>
<P>
   The United States did not even fire a shot on goal for the first
31 minutes. In the first half, it could not string together as many
as three passes. Meanwhile, a goal by German midfielder Andy
Moeller sent the Americans backpedaling eight minutes into the
game. The Germans maintained possession with one-touch passes,
working the ball around from side to side, stretching the Americans
until they spotted a rip in a defensive seam.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first half, we were always a step slow,'' Reyna said.
``We exerted so much energy moving without the ball, when we got it
we were tired. We had no energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Burns, who plays hard but who is a defender masquerading as
a midfielder, was overmatched on the right wing and was replaced by
Frankie Hejduk at halftime. Eric Wynalda appeared rusty and
unassertive at forward, playing his first significant minutes since
undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery two months ago. He, too, was
relieved in the second half by Roy Wegerle.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were obviously trying to score; the problem was,
the forwards could hardly put the ball into the net if the midfield
couldn't deliver the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The opener was supposed to be the optimum time to face Germany,
which traditionally starts slowly and builds throughout the World
Cup. And the Americans were quite familiar with the opponent, given
that eight members of the team play or have played in the German
Bundesliga. But familiarity did nothing to bridge the wide gap
between these two teams. Germany is here to win a fourth World Cup,
while the Americans are still essentially here to win respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think nerves got to us in the first half,'' Hejduk said. ``A
lot of people were nervous out there. They came out hard and strong
and we weren't ready for that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even with an ambitious 3-6-1 formation, which features three
defenders, six midfielders and a lone forward and which has
produced repeated chances to score in recent games, the Americans
were certain to find it difficult to advance to the second round.
Now they will quickly go home if they cannot defeat Iran on Sunday
in Lyons, and Yugoslavia next Thursday in Nantes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to match them physically, and we didn't do that in
the first 20 minutes,'' said goalkeeper Kasey Keller, who said the
Americans might have been made too shy by warnings that rough play
would not be tolerated by the referees. ``If you can't match them
physically, you're in a lot of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing the Americans did not want to do was to surrender
an early goal. But eight minutes into the game, Germany's Juergen
Klinsmann split David Regis and Ernie Stewart and headed a corner
kick to teammate Andy Moeller, who was left unmarked in front of
the goal. Burns stood on the goal line, apparently in perfect
position for a deflection, but Moeller's header somehow slithered
between his hip and the left post.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fluke goal,'' Burns said. ``It was an awkward spot; I
couldn't control it with my chest or my hips. It was like the ball
had eyes. I didn't think it had enough space to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Satisfied to be down 1-0 at halftime, the Americans nearly tied
the game in the 54th minute when Regis lifted an exquisite cross to
Hejduk, who launched a diving header at Andreas Kopke, the German
goalie. Only a diving reach by Kopke kept the ball out of the net.
</P>
<P>
   That was it for the American surge. Ten minutes later, Germany
struck again on a counterattack. Oliver Bierhoff sent a crossing
pass from the right flank to Klinsmann who freed himself when
Thomas Dooley jumped too early. Klinsmann chested the ball 10 yards
out and blasted a shot for his ninth goal in three World Cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first half, we showed them a little too much respect,''
Dooley said. ``We showed in the second half we don't have to be
afraid. I hope and believe we will show it in the next two games.''

 &HT;    Asian economic troubles will hurt U.S., strategist warns
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock market tumble that opened the week is expected to
continue today on fear that Asia's economic problems will hurt U.S.
corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be pleasant (this morning),'' Al Goldman,
chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons, told Dow Jones News
Service. He added, however, that the Dow is now ``deeply
oversold,'' and may be poised for an eventual move higher.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's fall in fact gave the Dow Jones industrial average its
fifth worst one-day point loss ever. The benchmark index of 30 blue
chip stocks dropped 207.01 points, or 2.3 percent, falling below
the psychologically important 8,700 level to close at 8,627.93.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Dow's worst day since Jan. 9, and the market's
broadest decline since April 27. Broader and secondary market
averages fell just shy of 2 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   The fall Monday was compounded by the fact that investors who
might normally be seeking bargains stayed out of the market with an
eye toward Asia, Dow Jones suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying problem is the year-old Asian economic malaise.
Already, corporate profits in the United States have declined in
the fourth quarter of 1997 and first quarter of 1998. And while
many analysts have anticipated a rise in second-half profits of
more than 10 percent for Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 companies, the
concern now is that Asia's continuing crisis may reduce that
increase.

SPORTS COLUMN: OUTJUMPED, OUTRUN, OUTSHOVED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Let's go over this. The operative spin-doctor theory was
that if the United States had to play Germany in the World Cup, it
might as well be in the very first game before the old champs
sorted out their geriatric cases and their physiotherapy cases.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the theory. In fact, it took only a few seconds to
separate the Maenner from the Jungen.
</P>
<P>
   That was how long it took for Jens Jeremies to get within
striking distance of Claudio Reyna. The American playmaker, who
earns his living in the Bundesliga and learned years ago about
German work habits, had expected somebody to mark him, and Jeremies
zeroed in on him like a smart missile. Jeremies delivered a ringing
whack in Reyna's kidney area, and for the rest of the night, the
Germans went about stealing the Americans' lunch, pushing them
around, outjumping them, outrunning them, outshoving them. It was
so much worse than the 2-0 score that I find myself at a loss
trying to quantify this for Jordan fans back home, starved for a
basketball box score full of goals and assists and rebounds. I can
only give a few brutal examples of how the big guys bullied the
little guys for just about 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Poor America. It waited four years to get back in the World Cup,
to show that the wink-wink rapid naturalization processes and the
suburban orange-cone leagues and the training ground of Major
League Soccer were producing a new race of lads who can play this
game.
</P>
<P>
   Did any Yanks have a good night? Well, Frank Sinatra sounded
great in his record of ``New York, New York'' during the pre-game
warm-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The game had dreadful overtones of the Yanks' opening game in
the 1990 World Cup when they were completely outplayed in a 5-1
loss to Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   Reyna knew all week that he would be marked by somebody. By
process of elimination, it was going to be the shaggy-haired,
24-year-old Jeremies who plays for TSV 1860 Muenchen in the same
league as Reyna.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know him real well,'' Reyna said. ``I know all those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   They, in turn, know him _ a kid with good moves who was held
back by injury from participating in the 1994 World Cup, and is not
quite as good as he could be, according to his own coach, whose
name is (and, as Dave Barry would say, I am not making this up),
Wolfgang Wolf of Wolfsburg. ``If he gets hit three times, he's
basically taken out of the game,'' Wolf said this past season. ``I
want Claudio to show more spirit. He has so much talent, but he has
to use his potential more than he's doing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyna was pushed and shoved and elbowed so regularly that he was
not a factor. He said he did not feel the whack from Jeremies but
he started stiffening up with five minutes left in the game, and he
figured out the source.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could see it from the stands, the referee could have
done something about it,'' Reyna said afterward. ``I know him. He's
very aggressive. He always plays like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyna continued in that vein: ``They earned what they got. We
were not as aggressive. We didn't have the ball enough. We were a
little too relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the Yanks were totally outplayed. Mike
Burns let a ball slither over his body and into a narrow space
between himself and the right post for the first goal, and Thomas
Dooley was faked all the way to Versailles by Juergen Klinsmann on
the second goal.
</P>
<P>
   There is something instructive about watching a one-sided game
like this, because it raised the appreciation of just how good
soccer players can be. The Germans controlled nearly every ball in
the air, did something positive with their headers, won nearly
every contested tackle, and passed crisply. Berti Vogts, the German
coach, said they lost ``discipline'' in the second half. What else
is he going to say? Steve Sampson, the American coach, must get
some poise and attack in his lineup. I would propose he summarily
abandon his 3-6-1 formation, which leaves forwards like Eric
Wynalda exposed and useless. He should also get Tab Ramos in there
sooner than the 69th minute, for his crisp runs and inspired passes
and booming shots. Ramos is still recovering from knee surgery, but
the United States does not have time for him to recuperate fully.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sampson has to try to turn things around against Iran, which
does not have the size or speed or skill of Germany, but will have
intense reason to want to beat the United States. The Germans were
merely going about their business. I think they are warmed up now.

MCI OFFERS TO SELL MORE INTERNET UNITS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Continuing to try to win regulatory approval of its $37 billion
acquisition by Worldcom Inc., MCI Communications Corp. has offered
to sell additional components of its Internet business, people
close to the negotiations between MCI and regulators said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how precise MCI had been in its offer, but the
people close to the discussions said MCI had offered to sell parts
of its Internet business that were not included in the $625 million
deal that MCI struck with Cable and Wireless PLC last month.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Justice Department and antitrust regulators from the
European Union are weighing Worldcom's planned takeover of MCI,
which was announced last fall. The regulators are concerned that
the combined MCI-Worldcom could wield dominant power in the
Internet industry.
</P>
<P>
   MCI, the nation's No. 2 long-distance telephone company, is also
one of the country's largest Internet carriers. Worldcom's Uunet
operation is the world's biggest Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   MCI made a big gamble last month when it announced a deal to
sell to Cable and Wireless the wholesale part of MCI's Internet
business, but not the units that provide data services directly to
consumers and big business customers. Before the deal was made
public, MCI tried to win assurances from regulators that the Cable
and Wireless arrangement would be sufficient to allay antitrust
concerns about MCI-Worldcom, but the regulators refused to sign off
on either deal.
</P>
<P>
   In the apparent hope that it could present the regulators with a
fait accompli, MCI went ahead and announced the Cable and Wireless
deal anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``By divesting MCI's Internet backbone, we have eliminated any
overlap with Worldcom's Internet business,'' the chairman of MCI,
Bert Roberts Jr., said at the time. ``We have formed an agreement
that addresses antitrust concerns with the MCI-Worldcom merger.''
</P>
<P>
   The regulators did not agree. Karel van Miert, the European
Union's competition commissioner, has made no secret of his
intention to oppose MCI's deal with Worldcom unless the companies
sell additional Internet assets.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has said it may not make a formal decision on
the MCI-Worldcom merger until July 15. But an influential advisory
committee is scheduled to meet on Friday and Van Miert will make a
recommendation to the committee before then.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has not set a formal time table for its
deliberation, but the department is working closely with the
European officials.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators hold significant bargaining power in their
negotiations with MCI and Worldcom, especially with Worldcom. If
the MCI-Worldcom deal does not win all of the necessary regulatory
approvals by the end of the year, MCI can demand $1.6 billion in
cash from Worldcom along with the right to walk away from the deal.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that the MCI-Worldcom merger would sail through the
regulatory reviews were Worldcom to agree to sell Uunet. But
Worldcom is not willing to do that. John Sidgmore, who runs Uunet,
is Worldcom's vice chairman and it is likely that Worldcom would
rather see the MCI deal die than sell Uunet.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves MCI and Cable and Wireless in an odd position. Cable
and Wireless recently sued MCI for the right of first refusal to
any additional Internet assets that MCI might sell. That suit was
rejected in court last week.

FORMER SYNAGOGUE NEAR AUSCHWITZ TO BECOME RELIGIOUS, CULTURAL
CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Israel, Germany, Poland)  (th) 
 By NADINE BROZAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until the Nazis marched in, the Polish town of Oswiecim, which
was named Auschwitz by the Germans, had 12 synagogues. All but one
were destroyed by the Nazis as they built the concentration camps
of Auschwitz and Birkenau. Somehow, one small house of worship
remained standing, and after the war it was converted into a carpet
warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the building, the former Lomdei Mishnayot Synagogue,
became the first property to be returned to the Polish Jewish
community under a government restitution program. But there was
only one Jew out of the prewar population of 7,000 still living in
Oswiecim, so the synagogue was passed on to Jews in nearby
Bielsko-Biala.
</P>
<P>
   In New York on Monday, flanked by congressmen and Holocaust
survivors, Fred Schwartz, a philanthropist once known as ``Fred the
Furrier,'' announced that the Auschwitz Jewish Center Foundation,
which he established in 1995, had taken title to the building and
an adjoining house.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to transform them into a Jewish religious and cultural
center where visitors to the camps will have a place to reflect and
say Kaddish, the prayer of mourning. It will also serve as a center
to teach about the Holocaust and the vibrant Jewish community that
flourished in Oswiecim from 1250 until the Nazis came. The
renovation is expected to cost $5 million to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz had no direct links to the camps, but when he visited
Auschwitz in 1993, ``it was as if I had had an epiphany,'' he said
at a news conference. ``The camps were a vacant environment of
namelessness, facelessness,'' he said. ``I felt that until we can
attach human characteristics to the people who perished there, we
won't understand the horror.''
</P>
<P>
   With his wife, Allyne, he began exploring ways to do that, and
learned of the synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is critical to underscore that, however correct Elie Wiesel
may be in reminding us to bear witness, Auschwitz is more than past
history and memory,'' said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., the only
Holocaust survivor in Congress. ``It is also a place of the present
and the future. Its importance is not only to pay tribute to
martyrs but to make a connection between the internments of the
past, the dangers of the present and the hopes of the future.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Hirsch Kornreich, a Bobover Hasidic Jew and retired real
estate broker from Brooklyn, who spoke along with Ascher Scharf,
another survivor, the memories are overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Kornreich, 69, was born in the house that is to be renovated,
which was home to his family for 150 years. His voice breaking, he
pointed to a photo of the building and showed the windows of the
room where his parents and grandparents were married, where he was
circumcised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The synagogue was where my parents prayed, where my bar
mitzvah took place,'' he said, pointing to it. ``The bar mitzvah
marked the last of my freedom. One day shortly after that I was
kidnapped by the SS and taken to a labor camp. There, on May 12,
1942, I was told that my entire family, 144 people, was deported to
a death camp, one of the first families to be burned there. I
didn't even have the privilege of saying Kaddish for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing the experience before an audience was unbearably
painful, he said, explaining: ``I had pictures of my mother, my
father, of my cousins playing there, flashing in my mind. The whole
picture of the past came in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Kornreich, who returned to the house only once, in 1993, is
looking forward to its rededication, probably in two or three
years. He will take his wife, five children and 40 grandchildren
and great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will stand in front of my house and my synagogue and I will
know that the people of Israel will live forever,'' he said.

U.S. OPEN REMAINS LEHMAN'S FAVORITE TOURNAMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few days after last year's U.S. Open, Tom Lehman recalls, he
went to a driving range and angrily hit golf balls as hard as he
could for several hours. Who could blame him? For the third
consecutive year, Lehman had held or shared the lead after three
rounds of the Open, yet he failed to win it. In 1995, he finished
third. In 1996, he finished tied for second. And last year, Lehman
was third again.
</P>
<P>
   Change a shot here, or a bad bounce there, and Lehman could very
well have at least one Open title, maybe more. Instead, he is still
trying to win his first; it is the tournament he wants the most,
and the tournament that has dealt him the most heartache.
</P>
<P>
   Will Lehman carry an extra burden this week, haunted by too many
bad memories and two many missed opportunities? Lehman doesn't
think so. He still loves the Open, even if it doesn't always love
him back. In fact, he smiled when asked to describe how he feels
about this year's Open, which begins Thursday at The Olympic Club
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been my favorite tournament, ever since I saw
Tom Watson chip in at Pebble Beach to win back in 1982,'' Lehman
said. ``I was just out of college back then, and it was very
exciting. I was at the point in my life where my dream of being a
professional golfer was actually on the verge of becoming reality.
I said to myself, `That's the one I want.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I still want it. At my age, 39, you're still at a time of your
career when you have a lot of prime years left. I can't say I'm
due, because golf doesn't owe you anything. But if I keep knocking
on the door, I think I'll get one.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Lehman has the accurate tee-to-green game suited for
the tournament this week. And he will not lose because of a lack of
preparation. During last Friday's heavy afternoon rain at the
Westchester Country Club, a solitary figure stood on the putting
green, hitting putt after putt, ignoring the rain. It was Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   Dedication like that lifted Lehman from mini-tours 10 years ago
to the top of his profession today. Ask Lehman about the lean
years, 1986 through 1991, when he lost his PGA Tour card, and he
will tell you about taking showers in the rain because he couldn't
afford a motel, or emptying his bank account to play in a
tournament in South Africa. Lehman knows hard times, and though he
is financially secure now, he has not forgotten hard work.
</P>
<P>
   His ability to persevere makes Lehman confident that if he
contends again this weekend, he will not fold under the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've asked myself if I'm lacking something to win the
U.S. Open,'' said Lehman, a strange admission for someone who has
already won a major, the 1996 British Open. ``This is the answer I
came away with: I'm not lacking anything. I'm good enough. I'm
mentally tough enough. I just have to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played well at the Open, but I've made some mistakes the
last nine holes when victory was in sight. I got too aggressive. If
I was so nervous I couldn't breathe, couldn't get the club back,
then I'd be worried. But it's a lot easier to be more patient than
it is to correct choking your guts out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lehman was encouraged by his third-place finish at the 1995 U.S.
Open at Shinnecock Hills. But the last two years have been more
difficult for him to take. In 1996 at Oakland Hills, Lehman made
the turn for the back nine Sunday with a three-stroke lead. But he
bogeyed Nos. 10 and 12, then made a crucial final bogey at No. 18,
which opened the door for Steve Jones to win by one stroke. Lehman
got a bad break on his tee shot on that final hole when it landed
in the fairway, but kicked hard left into a bunker. He was forced
to pitch out instead of going for the green on his next shot. After
his third shot landed 15 feet from the pin, he missed the putt.
Jones made a steady pressure-packed par, and Lehman was denied
again.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at Congressional Country Club was even more
frustrating. Tied for the lead as he reached No. 16 on Sunday,
Lehman was too aggressive. He aimed for the pin instead of the fat
part of the green and made bogey. Then, on his second shot at the
17th, Lehman hit a 7-iron into the water next to the green, and his
hope for winning sank with his ball. Ernie Els collected his second
U.S. Open title. Lehman collected more condolences.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was painful,'' said Lehman, who stared in disbelief for
several agonizing moments after he saw his ball disappear into the
water. ``I was in perfect position to win that tournament, tied for
the lead with three holes to play, and sitting in the middle of the
fairway at 16. Making bogey at 16, that's where I'm talking about
getting too aggressive. The pin was way back right and if I had
just taken it 20 feet left of the hole, maybe I still could have
won. But by going right at the flag, and missing it just a hair to
the right, then I was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough. It felt like I should have won that one.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, Lehman's disappointment showed in his game. Though
he won the European PGA Tour Loch Lomond tournament last July, he
has not won on the PGA Tour since the 1996 Tour Championship.
Lehman was the 1996 PGA Tour Player of the Year, winning his first
major, more than $1.7 million in earnings, and firmly establishing
himself as one of the world's best. But Lehman's earning fell to a
bit more than $960,000 last year, and he has been fighting a flaw
in his swing for a month that has sent many of his iron shots
hooking left.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Lehman's difficulty swinging was also caused by losing
about 30 pounds since last year, which slightly threw off his
timing and balance. Life can be cruel sometimes. While Lehman
looked and felt better, he was playing worse. Yet, he has been more
consistent the past month, and what better time would there be for
Lehman to end a victory drought than this week?
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins the Open this year will have to handle one of
golf's most difficult challenges. Under normal circumstances,
Olympic is a severe test. But set to U.S. Golf Association
standards, with thick, 5-inch deep rough, the course will be
particularly brutal.
</P>
<P>
   On a scorecard, the Lake Course at Olympic does not look
particularly challenging, measuring 6,797 yards, with only one
fairway bunker and no water hazards. What makes the layout so
tough? The greens are among the smallest in tournament golf.
Precision is more important than power at Olympic, forcing long
hitters to put their drivers away on most holes. It will be
essential for players to drive the ball accurately, yet keeping the
ball in the fairways will be even more difficult because the
fairways are sloping, sometimes pushing tee shots toward the rough.
</P>
<P>
   But Lehman has proved at previous opens that he is methodical
and poised enough not to be fazed when birdies are hard to come by.
So while much of the focus this week will be on other golfers like
Els, Tiger Woods, Justin Leonard, David Duval, Colin Montgomerie,
Casey Martin and Fred Couples, Lehman is looking forward to another
chance. Let others grab the headlines during the week. Lehman
simply wants the trophy on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the pressure is off a little bit because the focus of
golf has gotten so much on the younger players,'' Lehman said.
``The expectation level is on me isn't as high, but my expectations
are still the same. If I'm playing well, there's no reason I can't
be in position to win.''

SIX-TIME CHAMPIONS FACE UNCERTAIN FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ It will take lots of money and a huge dose of
humility. But mostly, the greatest basketball player ever will have
to decide whether to pack it in after another game for the ages or
come back because he is the only person who can top Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping America's sports dynasty intact will not be easy, but
Jordan and the Chicago Bulls made perhaps the best argument of all
not to go their own ways Sunday night by securing their third
consecutive National Basketball Association title and sixth in the
last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   They returned to Chicago as champions again but in much the same
way they left the devastated Delta Center _ in suspended animation,
no one sure about his immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors weigh heavily into whether the owner, Jerry
Reinsdorf, and the general manager, Jerry Krause, decide to rebuild
rather than reload. Among the issues they face are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Scottie Pippen's professed desire to play elsewhere as opposed
to securing a lucrative deal from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach Phil Jackson's professed desire to sit out a year and
weigh his options away from the game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether Jordan believes the franchise can genuinely compete
for a championship if he decides to play one more season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he definitely wants to play,'' Jordan's agent, David
Falk, said recently. ``He wants to play for a championship-caliber
team in Chicago. So I hope that they can create an atmosphere where
they're not going through transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaching vacancies notwithstanding, Jackson is said to be
leaning toward a sabbatical from the game. While Pippen's decision
may have the domino effect, the league's unsettled labor situation
could also play a pivotal part in whether the Bulls stay together.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, the owners lock out the players on July 1, it
will postpone all free-agent signings and trades until a new
collective bargaining agreement is signed by both sides. It will
give Jordan, Pippen, Dennis Rodman and their supporting cast more
time to consider their options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless something absolutely unusual happens, I don't expect to
see us back here,'' Jackson said after Jordan shot down the Jazz in
the final seconds of an 87-86 victory on Sunday. ``And what a great
run it's been.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would consider retiring, Jordan declined to
give a definitive answer. ``You know, it's a gut feeling,'' he
said. ``It's just a feeling I have. When I walked away the first
time, it was a feeling. It wasn't something someone told me. When I
came back, it was a feeling. If and when that time comes, where
I've got to walk away, I hope that because I walked away no one
will look at me any less.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of losing Jordan will be felt far and wide around the
league, from NBC's ratings to sellouts in visiting arenas. The
desire for him to play one more season grows with each game-winning
shot. Not that Jordan is letting that influence his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, the economy may take a different turn,'' he said. ``But
I would advise you to invest wisely. And my life has to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a pretty big challenge,'' he said of returning.
``But the question is, do I want to do that or not, and that's the
thing that has to be debated over the summer. My answer is, there's
still a lot of unanswered questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Jordan has said that he will not play for a coach other
than Jackson, he seems to have softened his stance in the past few
weeks and has hitched his wagon more to Pippen's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Even without his All-Star teammate, however, Jordan could have a
team with championship potential. Toni Kukoc has developed into
enough of an offensive force to shoulder some of the scoring burden
in his move to small forward. If Krause could secure a capable
veteran in the free-agent market, Jordan might not see a severe
drop-off in talent.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a major overhaul of the roster would probably
mean this current Chicago crop of players has indeed played
together for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has reportedly cleared out his office. Steve Kerr,
another free agent, seemed to be of the opinion that the Bulls had
made their last run.
</P>
<P>
   With Jordan able to command in the neighborhood of $40 million a
season in salary, and with only so many dollars to go around, the
thinking is that Reinsdorf will spend only so much to pursue a
fourth straight championship _ a feat last accomplished by the
Boston Celtics, who won eight consecutive titles from 1959 to 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that we planned this as our last year,''
Jackson said. ``Right now, we're just celebrating it as our last
year. Unless something absolutely unusual comes out of left field,
I don't expect to see us back again.'' &QL;

IN TV INTERVIEW, LOTT CALLS HOMOSEXUALITY A `SIN' 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an unusual interview about his personal beliefs,
Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, agreed on Monday with a
conservative talk show host that homosexuality is a sin and then
compared it to such personal problems as alcoholism, kleptomania
and sex addiction.
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi Republican made his remarks in a 40-minute taped
interview conducted by Armstrong Williams for the America's Voice
network, a cable television network. The interview _ part of a
series on some of the nation's political leaders _ was timed for
Father's Day and is scheduled for broadcasting over the weekend or
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Williams explored a range of social topics from Lott's
thoughts on disciplining children (he said that on occasion he used
a belt) to his opposition to abortion to his views on the role of
men and women in marriage. He described his childhood growing up in
Mississippi in the 1950s and early 1960s as a ''good time for
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott has made his views on homosexuality known in the past,
speaking out in 1996 against a bill, narrowly defeated by the
Senate, that would have banned discrimination against homosexuals
in the work place. At the time he called the legislation ''part of
a larger and more audacious effort to make the public accept
behavior that most Americans consider dangerous, unhealthy or just
plain wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Monday by Williams whether homosexuality is a sin, Lott
replied, ``yes, it is.'' He added that ``in America right now
there's an element that wants to make that alternative lifestyle
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said, ``You still love that person and you should not try
to mistreat them or treat them as outcasts. You should try to show
them a way to deal with that.'' He said that his own father had had
a problem with alcoholism, adding that ``others have a sex
addiction or are kleptomaniacs. There are all kinds of problems and
addictions and difficulties and experiences of this kind that are
wrong. But you should try to work with that person to learn to
control that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   With the investigation of President Clinton's connection to a
former White House intern as a backdrop, Lott also spoke about his
marriage to his wife, Tricia. He said he had never been unfaithful
to her during their 34 years of marriage ``because I love her and
because I believe that's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he were ever tempted, he allowed, ``Sure I was. I'm a
human being.'' But he said he takes great care to ensure that his
behavior is beyond reproach. When he travels in his Mississippi
district with a woman who works for him as a field worker, he said,
``I would never get in a situation where it was just the two of us
in a car.'' He said he took that precaution ``because just the
appearance bothered me.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that when visitors come to his office, ``I quite often
prefer to have three of us in the room, not just two.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said his opposition to abortion was taught to him by his
mother. He remembered coming home from high school and telling his
mother he thought abortion might be acceptable under certain
conditions, only to see her drop a dish towel and burst into tears.
``She started crying and said, `If I have raised you to have no
moral respect for human life then I have failed,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, who is a Southern Baptist, stepped carefully when asked
about the Southern Baptist Convention's declaration that a woman
should ``submit herself graciously'' to her husband's leadership.
He said that he felt ``very strongly'' about his faith, but said he
would speak of marriage roles ``in different terms.'' Spouses, he
said, should ``serve each other.''

 &HT;    Gailey working to make Cowboys younger
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ When Chan Gailey inherited the Dallas Cowboys
four months ago, he found a team of graybeards whose best years
were behind them.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were the NFL's third-oldest team last season. The
first-year coach is shedding some of the team's old geezers.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's hit list includes a who's who of Cowboys legends.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Bill Bates, 37, and running back Herschel Walker, 36, are
unrestricted free agents who are not expected to be invited to
summer camp. Guard Nate Newton, 36, knowing his job was on the
line, dropped nearly 100 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Wade Wilson, 39, and wideout Anthony Miller, 33,
already have been released. Tackle Mark Tuinei, 39, wants to make a
comeback but his chances are weaker than his surgically repaired
knees.
</P>
<P>
   The old and wise Cowboys still have enough talented players to
make a serious run at the playoffs, 31-year-old quarterback Troy
Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tendency in the NFL, especially when you get past
30, for people to say you've lost a step,'' Aikman said. ``I still
feel that the guys who have can still be awfully productive.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's optimism coincides with the arrival of Gailey, a
no-nonsense coach who replaced Barry Switzer. The veteran
quarterback was so enthusiastic during last week's minicamp at
Valley Ranch, he said he wants to play though the 2003 season.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman won't make public digs against Switzer, but their
relationship was strained for several years. The energetic Gailey
is one reason Aikman believes the current core of veterans will win
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nucleus has been here a number of years, but you can look
at that in many ways,'' Aikman said. ``We're not to the point where
we can't be productive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When guys get older, it doesn't mean they can't play,'' wide
receiver Michael Irvin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean you can't play at the same level you used to
play at. Actually, sometimes when you get a little older, you get
better, you get wiser.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the only teams older than the Cowboys were San
Francisco and Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is making plans to upgrade its youth movement. For
starters, third- year pro Randall Godfrey is making a run at a new
position, middle linebacker. That spot has been filled by veteran
Fred Strickland for two years but Godfrey rotated at the position
in minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Dave Campo said the Cowboys will use their
best three linebackers. That could turn out to be Godfrey, Dexter
Coakley and veteran Broderick Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Greg Ellis is projected to start at defensive end.
Third-year pro Kavika Pittman, a disappointment in his first two
years in Dallas, is the likely starter on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   The future of 30-year-old defensive end Tony Tolbert remains in
question. He rested two bad knees during minicamp, an indication
his days as a major contributor might be over. Tolbert is scheduled
to count $3.4 million against the Cowboys' salary cap this season
but Gailey isn't ready to pull the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Tolbert remains with the team, Gailey said,
``Today, you better believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other young players who are expected to compete on defense are
rookie lineman Michael Myers, rookie linebacker Darren Hambrick and
fifth-year defensive end Hurvin McCormack.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Cantu writes for the Austin American-Statesman, Austin,
Texas.

NORTEL TO BUY INTERNET EQUIPMENT MAKER FOR $9 BILLION  
 (ATTN.: CALIF., MASS.)
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grasping for leadership in the market for Internet
communications equipment, Northern Telecom Ltd. of Canada, North
America's No. 2 maker of telephone gear, announced Monday that it
had agreed to acquire Bay Networks Inc., a leading data networking
company, for $9.1 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's deal was the largest in a recent series of mergers in
the telecommunications equipment and data networking sectors.
Companies that have thrived making equipment for traditional
telephone systems have been trying to jump into the fast-growing
market for gear that links computers at high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, small communications equipment makers and foreign
companies that have struggled to win business from big U.S.
communications carriers have looked to mergers as a way to enhance
their distribution networks.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Alcatel Alsthom of France, one of the world's
biggest communications equipment makers, tried to bolster its
presence in the United States when it agreed to acquire DSC
Communications Corp. for $4.4 billion in stock. Earlier that week
Ciena Corp. agreed to be acquired by Tellabs Inc. for $7.1 billion
in stock.
</P>
<P>
   With Monday's announcement Northern Telecom made a bold, and
expensive, bid for a company with a culture that appears quite
different from its own and that has had difficulty in recent years
meeting the high expectations of Wall Street and industry experts.
</P>
<P>
   As a maker of equipment that routes information between
computers, Bay has had some difficulty contending with competition
from Cisco Systems Inc., which is three times Bay's size.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts agreed that integrating Bay and Northern Telecom
successfully could pose a challenge but said the deal made sense in
light of the fundamental direction of the companies' industries.
</P>
<P>
   Networks based on Internet technology, known as IP, for Internet
protocol, are gaining in popularity over more traditional
circuit-switched networks. While traditional networks in essence
force different streams of information to stay within their own
digital lanes, networks based on Internet technology can perform
more efficiently by allowing packets of information to switch lanes
in search of faster paths to their destinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to design networks that are designed for IP and put
the voice over top of that, which is a huge change from the circuit
world of the past,'' John Roth, Northern Telecom's chief executive,
said in an interview. Referring to Bay's chairman, Roth added, ``In
talking to Dave House, we were looking to put some of their
technology in our products. Then we realized the fit was just
great.''
</P>
<P>
   But investors were not so sure of that Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Telecom's shares fell by 15.2 percent after the deal
was announced, falling $9.6875, to $54 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Some institutional investors had told Northern Telecom's
management that they would not support an acquisition of Bay, which
had been rumored for weeks, and they followed through on that
promise.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, shareholders of Bay will
receive 0.6 share of Northern Telecom for each share of Bay owned.
Northern Telecom's shares closed at $63.6875 on Friday, making the
deal worth $38.21 for each share of Bay. Investors had speculated
that Northern Telecom could acquire Bay for a price in the
mid-$30s.
</P>
<P>
   Bay's shares closed on Friday at $28.3125, meaning the original
premium for Bay's stockowners was about 35 percent. Shares of Bay
rose 8.6 percent, or $2.4375 Monday, to $30.75.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Telecom said the deal, which it intends to complete in
the third quarter, would dilute the company's earnings this year
and add to earnings after that, discounting charges the company
will take to pay for the merger. Some analysts, however, said that
was an aggressive timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Another financial issue that emerged Monday was that as a
Canadian company, and as one that is mostly owned by another
company, BCE of Canada, Northern Telecom must use the purchase
method of merger accounting, which forces an acquirer to take
charges against future earnings to cover the difference between the
assessed value of the target and the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last quarter Bay had a book value of $1.5 billion.
If Northern Telecom pays $9.1 billion for the company, it could
have to take charges of as much as $7.6 billion. Analysts estimated
that Northern Telecom would try to write off as much as 80 percent
of that as a one-time charge to cover the value of Bay's in-process
research and development.
</P>
<P>
   House would become president of Northern Telecom, taking that
title from Roth, but would remain based at Bay's present
headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif. That also raised concerns among
analysts, because many of Bay's recent problems emerged because of
an internal rift between the company's two predecessors, Synoptics
Communications, based in Santa Clara, and Wellfleet Communications,
based in Billerica, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Synoptics and Wellfleet merged in 1994 to form Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we take a three- to five-year horizon, we may well say this
was a good deal for Nortel,'' said Gregory Geiling, an analyst for
J.P. Morgan Securities. ``Near term, though, this is going to be a
very difficult acquisition to integrate, from a culture
perspective, from a product perspective and from a location
perspective, and that's why investors are really beating up Nortel
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bay was advised in the transaction by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
and by the law firm of Simpson Thacher &AMP; Bartlett. Northern Telecom
was advised by Deutsche Bank Securities and by the law firm of
Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &AMP; Hamilton. &QL;

IN BOOMING ECONOMY, POOR STILL STRUGGLE TO PAY THE RENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JASON DePARLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite the economy's robust growth, low-income
families continue to face extreme problems in the most basic of
economic transactions: paying the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Two studies released in the past two months have found that,
unlike past economic recoveries, the boom times of the mid-1990s
have done nothing to ease the housing problems of the poor. Indeed,
the problem may have grown worse.
</P>
<P>
   Though housing costs vary widely by region, the severe and
growing shortage of affordable apartments persists from east to
west; in central cities, suburbs and rural areas, and among all
racial and ethnic groups. The new data suggest that, through boom
or bust, the escalating gap between the incomes of needy renters
and their shelter costs has become an abiding feature of the modern
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The study released on Monday by the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, a Washington research and advocacy group, added fresh
details to the discouraging picture. The study, which covered the
expansion years of 1993 to 1995, found that unlike the economic
expansion of the 1980s, when the rental burdens of the poor
lightened, this time they showed no improvement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, 4.1 million poor families spent more than half their
income on rent and utilities, the study found. By 1995 that figure
had grown to 4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in 1993, the count of needy families outnumbered
affordable apartments by 3.8 million. But by 1995, the gap between
grew to 4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the typical family of poor renters spent about 60
percent of their income on shelter, twice the percentage the
government defines as being affordable, the study found. That
figure was the same in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The study defined a cheap apartment as one that rented for less
than $300 in 1995, and a needy renter as one earning less than
$12,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The center's findings echo those of the government, including an
April report by the Department of Housing and Urban Development
that also concluded that a growing economy had done nothing to ease
the housing problems of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that for low-income families, housing
affordability had become a ``a fundamental structural problem,''
despite ``robust economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The center's study mirrors many of our own findings,'' said
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Andrew Cuomo.
``Unfortunately, there are a lot more $6-an-hour jobs than
$6-an-hour apartments.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The portrait of low-income housing did contain one bit of
encouraging news. The number of severely dilapidated apartments
continues to decline. In 1985, 22 percent of poor renters lived in
seriously substandard housing. A decade later, that figure had
declined to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of needy renters rest at the intersection of three
distinct trends. One, their incomes have stagnated. Two, shelter
costs are growing faster than inflation as a whole. And three, the
government is no longer expanding the supply of subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
   Partisans may quibble over the details, but ``there is general
agreement about the magnitude of the affordability problem,'' said
John Weicher, who served as an assistant housing secretary under
President George Bush. ``The disagreement is over what to do about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is asking Congress to offer rental
subsidies to an additional 100,000 families this year. During the
heyday of government housing programs, 1977 to 1981, the government
added about 260,000 families a year to its roster of subsidized
renters. During the administrations of President Reagan and
President Bush, that number still grew, though more slowly,
averaging 70,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1995, when the Republicans took over Congress, the
government has stopped expanding the pool of subsidized housing for
the first time in modern history. Much of the cutback has been
budget-driven. It costs about $6,000 a year to keep an average
family in subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
   Though about 15 million households now qualify for federal
housing assistance, only about 4.5 million families get it. Of
them, about a third live in conventional public housing projects.
The others have subsidies that allow them to live in private
housing. In each case, tenants contribute 30 percent of their
income toward the rent, and the government provides the rest.
</P>
<P>
   While the government's efforts have slowed, the crux of the
problem remains in the private market. Demolition and
gentrification have destroyed many low-cost units. And the cost of
the housing that has replaced low-cost units is simply more than
the neediest renters can pay.
</P>
<P>
   Market forces can supply the poor with cheap clothing, toys or
food. But many housing costs are fixed, such as land, taxes,
utilities and interest. The ability of builders to economize
therefore remains limited. From 1991 to 1995, the average rent paid
by a low-income renter rose 21 percent, the study found, compared
to a general inflation rate of 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While the housing problems of the poor may seem a perennial
concern, they have undergone a sea change in the past generation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, there were about 300,000 more cheap apartments than
there were needy renters, or 6.2 million renters for 6.5 million
apartments. By 1995, however, the situation had reversed. By then,
there were 10.5 million needy renters, and just 6.1 million cheap
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that about 80 percent of poor renters spend more
than 30 percent of their income on shelter. And about 60 percent
spend more than half their income on rent. Leaving aside those with
subsidies, the average poor renter spends an astonishing 77 percent
of income on shelter costs.
</P>
<P>
   While Weicher agrees that the recovery has been slow to ease the
housing problems of the poor, he predicts a less discouraging
report when more recent data is made available from the Census
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd expect some improvement from 1995 to 1997,'' he said.
``This recovery was slower than previous recoveries to reach people
at the bottom.''

BOTHA AVOIDS CROSS-EXAMINATION IN CONTEMPT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Disappointing many South Africans
who wanted to see one of apartheid's harshest leaders submit to
cross-examination, lawyers for former President P.W. Botha began
closing arguments in his contempt trial Monday without calling him
or anyone else to the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   Botha, 82, is on trial for repeatedly refusing to appear before
the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which wants to
question him about his role in atrocities committed under his
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But the frail Botha, who sits in court on a specially padded
chair beside the dock, has called the commission investigating
South Africa's brutal past a ``circus'' that he will not submit to.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing his case, his lawyers intend to lean heavily on
potential technical faults in the subpoena. Privately, they say
that if the subpoena is thrown out, it is unlikely that the
commission or the prosecutor will be interested in trying the case
again.
</P>
<P>
   But they were unable to finish in the one day allotted to them,
so the case was adjourned until Aug. 17. A ruling is expected the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution of Botha has been contentious, with many whites
complaining that it is simply a vengeful act against an old man. At
the start of the trial, there were widespread expectations of
demonstrations and even violence from his supporters. But few have
turned up, and Botha usually has had only a handful of friends and
his daughter in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to raise money for his defense have also fallen flat.
His legal fees are perhaps as much as $5,000 a day, and his former
agriculture minister, Greyling Wentzel, said recently that he had
only about $2,000 in pledges.
</P>
<P>
   During the eight-day trial, the prosecution called more than a
half dozen witnesses trying to make clear that the commission had
good reason to want to question Botha. Some of the testimony
consisted of dry accounts of the documents the commission has
uncovered, some of them calling for anti-apartheid activists to be
``eliminated,'' ``neutralized'' or permanently removed from
society.
</P>
<P>
   But other witnesses brought home the pain and the horror of the
attacks on the supposed enemies of the state. One witness was
present when a church building was blown up, and he was sucked
through the floor. Botha, who was in office from 1978 to 1989, is
accused of having ordered the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   In summing up his case, the prosecutor, Bruce Morrison, lashed
out at Botha, saying he had chosen to treat the commission's
subpoenas as if the commission did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``His refusal to attend is the result of a willful and
deliberate defiance,'' Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the former president, who was ousted in an
internal party struggle after he suffered a stroke, had harmed his
claim that the commission was biased. Morrison said Botha, in
last-minute negotiations to avert the trial, had agreed to appear
before the panel for an ``investigation'' but not a full hearing.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts, therefore, stand ``revealed as an unsuccessful
exercise in devious defiance _ seeking to find some technical
failing somewhere while in reality the accused would have
testified, if he could have cloaked this in a face-saving
formula,'' Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to arguing that the subpoena is invalid on technical
grounds, Botha's lawyers are trying to argue that the commission
was biased against Botha in issuing the subpoena in the first
place. They intend to highlight statements that various members of
the commission have made, which they believe show a prejudice
toward their client.
</P>
<P>
   And they are arguing that Botha did not have to appear before
the panel because he had made a deal with the chairman of the
commission, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, to answer questions only in
writing.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu denied this on the stand, but Botha's version of events
will apparently not be heard.
</P>
<P>
   During his testimony, the archbishop had also pleaded with Botha
to apologize for the pain that had occurred under his leadership, a
plea that clearly agitated the former president.
</P>
<P>
   Monday one of his lawyers, Ernst Penzhorn, spoke out on the
matter, saying Botha had been astonished by the request. ``He will
not reply to it at this stage,'' Penzhorn said. &QL;

EDITORIAL: STARR KEEPS TALKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 16:
</P>
<P>
   If the art of public relations were a handgun, Kenneth Starr
would have been footless long ago. The independent counsel has a
perverse gift for talking when he should remain silent and for
saying all the wrong things when he opens his mouth. An interview
in which he confessed to giving information to reporters is the
latest of Starr's golden bloopers. The interviewer, Steven Brill of
Brill's Content magazine, argues that Starr broke the law against
disclosure of grand jury information, and the White House weighed
in with its usual pitch for investigating Starr rather than
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In tracing coverage of the Monica Lewinsky story, Brill makes
telling points about journalistic excess and Starr's clumsiness.
But he also loads his legal argument against Starr and seems naive
about White House spin. There are, for example, federal court
decisions that support Starr's contention that he can discuss
matters that do not come directly from grand jury testimony. In our
interpretation, Justice Department rules do allow prosecutors
latitude in talking about investigations and in defending against
calculated attacks like those orchestrated by the White House.
Brill documents Paul Begala's decision to hit Starr with a ``food
fight'' over leaks and Lanny Davis' determination to divert
attention from what the president's secretary said about Ms.
Lewinsky's contacts with the White House by starting ``a fight
about the process and the prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   Such tactics, of course, inhibit rather than promote the public
interest. In that regard, Starr needs to produce his report to the
House of Representatives and bring any appropriate indictments, and
Clinton needs to countermand his lawyers' strategy of delay. Since
one of those lawyers, David Kendall, has asked a federal court to
look into Starr's contacts with the press, the question of Starr's
conduct is already before the proper forum. Judge Norma Holloway
Johnson has jurisdiction to discipline Starr if he has broken the
rules, or Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno can dismiss him.
</P>
<P>
   But the political situation remains fixed where it has been for
some time. Clinton's leadership stature has declined steadily for
definable reasons: deceptive or missing answers about his personal
and campaign finances, his response and that of his associates to
legal inquiries, his own abandonment of the plan to explain his
mystifying dealings with Ms. Lewinsky. The Independent Counsel Act
is often described as too far-reaching. But Starr has demonstrated
that even being armed with it is no guarantee of getting the truth
from this administration. &QL;

HONG KONG STOCKS DIVE, AS DO OTHER ASIAN MARKETS

 By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Now that Hong Kong has confirmed its economy is in
reverse, the bad news is coming thick and fast. Unemployment here
reached 4.2 percent from March through May, the highest rate in 15
years. And the stock market plunged 5.7 percent Monday to its
lowest closing level since Jan. 30, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   As they have been for three weeks, Hong Kong stocks were
battered by the falling Japanese yen. Analysts also said the
unemployment figures, announced Monday by the government, eroded
the confidence of investors, since Hong Kong offers little
protection to people who lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to 1 percent or 2 percent unemployment,'' said Ian
Perkin, chief economist of the Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce. ``People are starting to get very angry and uncertain
about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The plunge here in the benchmark Hang Seng stock index led a
steep Asian share decline. In Thailand, stocks tumbled 6 percent;
in South Korea, 4.8 percent; in the Philippines, 4.5 percent; in
Malaysia, 4.3 percent; in Singapore, 3.5 percent; in Japan, 1.3
percent, and in Indonesia, half of 1 percent. Only Taiwan, which
rose 2.3 percent, was spared.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Hong Kong's market is entering its third consecutive
week of heavy losses, analysts said the worst might be yet to come.
Japan and the United States have shown no signs of intervening to
arrest the fall of the yen. And Hong Kong's property market, which
drives the broader Hang Seng index, is undergoing a huge drop in
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Hang Seng dropped 452.94 points Monday, to 7,462.50. Some
analysts said it could slide to 6,900, its lowest point in 1995. In
a report on the Hong Kong economy, Salomon Smith Barney said the
index could fall as low as 5,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can shift the deck chairs, but we're not going to improve
the overall weight of the ship,'' said Jan Lee, chief economist
here at Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. ``We've got to go through this
pain before we can begin to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee predicted unemployment would rise to 5.5 percent by the end
of 1998. And he said that the overall economy, which shrank at a 2
percent annual rate in the first quarter, would probably finish
1998 with a 1 percent decline _ the first full year of recession
since Hong Kong began tracking its growth in 1961.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Milestones like these are fanning political tensions in this
normally apolitical territory. Several recently elected legislators
recently formed a coalition to press the government to ease the
economic pain. Coalition members, who include pro-democracy and
pro-Beijing representatives, have harshly criticized what they call
the government's aloofness and insensitivity to the plight of
ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to put some money back into people's pockets,''
said Emily Lau, an outspoken pro-democracy leader who was recently
elected to the Legislative Council here. ``Hong Kong is sitting on
this huge mountain of reserves, yet the government just tells
people they have to suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Lee, the head of the Liberal Party, who is leading the
coalition, said the government should inject some cash into the
economy by cutting taxes and accelerating several large public
works projects. ``We all feel that Hong Kong is facing a crisis,
but it seems that the government is unmoved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they had already moved up five such projects,
worth $168 million for jobs. The government also announced a
package of more modest measures, such as expanding the civil
service and improving job-training programs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Joseph W.P. Wong, Hong Kong's education and manpower
secretary, acknowledged that unemployment would probably rise
further before the economic crisis abated. He said retail,
restaurant and transportation industries had been hardest hit by
the recent surge in unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts noted that because Hong Kong's currency is
linked to the U.S. dollar at a fixed exchange rate, the territory
had little room to maneuver in responding to external economic
pressures like the declining yen. The government has defended the
currency, the Hong Kong dollar, by raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The slumping stock market, rising unemployment and soaring
interest rates are bad enough. But for this city of inveterate
gamblers, there was no more telling sign of economic distress than
the Hong Kong Jockey Club's announcement on Sunday that the amount
of money bet on horse racing fell for the first time since it
started keeping records in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you compare us to the stock market or the property
market, we're not doing that badly,'' said Wilson Cheng, a
spokesman for the Jockey Club, noting that $11.9 billion had been
bet at the races in the 1998 season, a decline of eight-tenths of a
percent from the previous season. &QL;

ASIAN CRISIS HITS WALL STREET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monday, investors finally got the message.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Wall Street has all but ignored warnings that the
Asian financial crisis could end the longest-running bull market in
US history. But panic selling of the Japanese yen and reports of
lower profits by companies that export to the region hammered home
the message that the US economy is increasingly vulnerable to the
economic disaster that has spread throughout Asia.
</P>
<P>
   By the market's close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had
tumbled 207.01 points, to 8,627.93. It was the fifth-worst point
loss ever in a single day, though the 2.3 percent drop did not come
close to breaking into the top 10 percentage declines.
</P>
<P>
   The slide came just one month after the Dow hit an all-time high
of 9,211.84, slashing the market's gain for all of 1998 from 16.5
percent on May 13 to 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing one-third of the world's economy in a depression,
and that has to have a major impact on the rest of the world,''
Larry Horwitz, managing director at Primark Decision Economics in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The gloom on Wall Street prompted some analysts to speculate
Monday that stocks could fall another 3 to 5 percent before
investors are reassured that corporate profits are rebounding and
that Asia's economic difficulties have hit bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is probably a few more percent left on the downside
before people say there is enough value in the market to step back
in,'' said Arun Kumar, senior stock startegist at Lehman Brothers
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian financial crisis also continued to affect markets
around the world. Key stock indexes in Hong Kong and Bangkok
tumbled nearly 6 percent. In Tokyo, the Nikkei stock average fell
1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's main index fell 4.8 percent,
the Philippines' fell 4.5 percent, Malaysian shares fell more than
4 percent, and Singapore's fell 3.5 percent. In Europe, Frankfurt's
DAX index fell 2.5 percent and London's 100 stock index fell 0.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite months of turmoil in Asia, the US market has continued
to benefit from a strong economy. Unemployment is at a 27-year low,
and consumer confidence is high. The Federal Reserve Board, assured
inflation remains in check, decided recently that it would not
raise interest rates. Oil prices, meanwhile, hit a 12-year low
Monday, further confirming that an inflationary spike is not
likely.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian slump has actually helped keep inflation low by
reducing the costs of imports from Asia purchased by American
consumers and pressuring US manufacturers to lower their prices.
But at the same time, the weak Japanese yen and a contracting Asian
economy has begun to reduce demand for US exports, particularly in
the high-tech sector. As a result, after double-digit growth each
quarter in 1997, profits grew at a much slower 1.2 percent pace in
the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Monday sharp market decline came on reports of lower
second-quarter profits by Millipore Corp. and Minnesota Mining &AMP;
Manufacturing Co. due to declining sales to their Asian customers.
Notably, 3M, which relies on Asia for one-quarter of its profits,
had the biggest decline among the 30 stocks in the Dow index; 3M
was down 5 13/16, closing at 81.
</P>
<P>
   Another Dow average company with exposure in Asia, J.P. Morgan &AMP;
Co., saw its stock all 2 3/4 to 118 7/8. The bank earned more than
half of its revenues outside the United States in the first
quarter. Many other companies are expected to report similar
earnings declines in upcoming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate profits are under enormous pressure right now,''
said Horwitz.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market is also under extreme pressure as the world's
investors buy up bonds in this country, seeking a safe haven for
their money at a time overseas markets are in turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest force driving up US bonds prices Monday was a
freefall in the Japanese yen. Traders have fled the yen due to
reports that Japan's economy is suffering its worst economic crisis
in the post-war period and that it is worsening. Government
officials in Japan declared last week that the world's
second-largest economy is officially in a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Investors pushed up prices of 30-year, US Treasury bonds and
drove their interest rates to an all-time low of 5.57 percent _
breaking the 5.65 percent level set last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The yen is in free fall, so what you have is investors from
Latin America and Asia buying Treasuries at any price just to get
their money in some stable currencuy,'' said Ben Hock, who manages
a $800 million mutual fund for John Hancock Funds.
</P>
<P>
   For now, investors are still surveying the damage in US stock
markets. &UR;  &LR; Following the Dow, the technology heavy NASDAQ fell 29.3
points, or 1.68 percent Monday, closing at 1715.75. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's Index was down 21.83 points, or 1.99 percent, closing at
1077.01.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  But some analysts said the long-term prospects for US and
world markets remain bright.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Madden, who heads emerging markets investing at Pioneer
Funds in Boston, predicted that low interest rates in the United
States and Europe were the strongest single force keeping Western
economies strong. He said that even if Asian economies do not
recover quickly, financial markets could rebound quickly. Europe's
bull market and liquidity in both US and European markets, Madden
said, would eventually ``spill back into the Asian markets.''

   STOCKS FALL TO 3-MONTH LOW ON GROWING ASIAN CONCERNS
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil in Asia has sent U.S. stock markets tumbling, wiping
out the gains of the last three months for the Dow Jones industrial
average. On Monday, the Dow fell 207 points, or 2.3 percent. Some
other market gauges have fallen even more, suggesting what Wall
Street calls a market correction _ a drop of 10 percent or more _
is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are increasingly concerned that the economic crisis in
Asia has yet to reach bottom. Japan, which many hoped would be the
region's savior, announced last week that its economy shrank
sharply in the first quarter, amounting to its steepest decline
since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Long-term Treasury rates &LR;  fell to their lowest level in 30
years. The yield dropped to 5.58 percent, from 5.66 percent on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   SUNBEAM DISMISSES CHIEF EXECUTIVE
</P>
<P>
   Albert Dunlap, who has gained a reputation as a turnaround
artist by downsizing many companies, was dismissed as chief
executive of Sunbeam. The board of Sunbeam, the consumer appliance
maker, said that 1998 earnings would be much worse than anticipated
and that outside directors had lost confidence in Dunlap's
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ASIAN NATIONS WANT JAPAN TO ACT
</P>
<P>
   The governments of China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and other Asian
countries have called on Japan to stem the fall of the yen, which
has been plummeting lately and has reached an eight year low.
</P>
<P>
   HONG KONG SUFFERS FROM TURMOIL
</P>
<P>
   The falling yen has caused economic concern in Hong Kong, where
stocks fell 5.7 percent _ the lowest level in more than three
years. Other markets in Asia also tumbled.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT AND COMPAQ BUY STAKES
</P>
<P>
   Both Microsoft and Compaq Computer are investing $212.5 million
for 10 percent stakes in Road Runner, a high-speed cable modem
Internet venture.
</P>
<P>
   MCI OFFERS TO SELL INTERNET UNITS
</P>
<P>
   Worldcom and MCI Communications have offered to sell more of
MCI's Internet business to win approval for their merger from
regulators. MCI agreed last month to sell parts of its Internet
business to Cable and Wireless for $625 million.
</P>
<P>
   GM FORCED TO CLOSE MORE PLANTS
</P>
<P>
   The North American operations of GM moved closer to being shut
down completely, as strikes at two Michigan parts factories forced
the auto maker to idle 13,000 more workers and partly close a host
of other parts and assembly plants. The strikes have now sent
63,100 workers home and closed more than 40 assembly and parts
factories in the United States, Mexico, and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   3M WARNS ABOUT LOWER EARNINGS
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing fell 6.7 percent,

KERRY, IN SPEECH, TO PROPOSE WIDE CHANGES IN PUBLIC EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator John F. Kerry, in a dramatic break from
Democratic dogma, plans to propose Tuesday gutting the seniority
systems that protect burned-out and unqualified teachers in many of
the nation's public schools, and instead providing principals and
superintendents greater powers to hire and fire at will.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy speech intended to serve as a partial foundation to
build a presidential campaign, Kerry will also propose dismantling
a teacher certification process that he said would prevent
historian Doris Kearns Goodwin from teaching high school history
because she does not have a master's degree in education.
</P>
<P>
   In an advance copy of the speech provided to the Boston Globe
Monday, Kerry crosses traditional party lines with abandon _
embracing many traditional Republican themes while distancing
himself in tone and substance from teachers unions, a powerful
bastion of Democratic support. Aides said Monday that he has spent
months pondering the elements of the speech as he tries to
strengthen his standing on education issues in anticipation of a
national campaign. He plans to deliver the address at 10 a.m. at
Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can convince me that a country that puts a man on the
moon or balances its budget or pushes its stock market over 9,000
cannot put a good teacher in every classroom, a discipline code for
every school community and a curriculum in every district that
challenges our children to reach higher and higher,'' says the
draft of Kerry's speech. ``Shame on us all for giving up on the
vast majority of our children before we've even joined the real
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry will advocate treating every public school as if it were a
charter school _ gutting the bureau-cracy that has become a popular
punching bag for politicians, stripping away many of the rules, and
allowing the principals to actively recruit the teachers they want
in their classrooms, even from other schools.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he said, all parents should be given a choice of
sending their children to any public school, though he stopped
short of endorsing school vouchers, a plan advocated by many
Republican leaders that allows parents to send children to private
and parochial schools with the government's financial help. Kerry
will argue that vouchers do not aid enough children and divert
attention from what he sees as the real problem: to fix public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time we end a system that condemns each child to an
administrator's choice and not a parent's choice, where possible,''
the speech says. ``Public school choice _ not private vouchers _ is
also quite simply and quite realistically a practical necessity,
even inevitability, because no one pretends there will ever be
enough commitment or money to build an alternative system for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech harks back to Kerry's controversial address at Yale
University in 1992, when he questioned the usefulness of the
nation's affirmative action programs, effectively crossing swords
with the traditions of his own party. Tuesday's speech, aides
privately said, will probably foreshadow a series of policy
pronouncements by Kerry seeking to find moderate ground on key
issues, much as President Clinton has done.
</P>
<P>
   By proposing to effectively gut the seniority, or tenure,
system, Kerry is joining calls from Republican Senator Alfonse M.
D'Amato of New York, among others. Clinton has not addressed the
topic of teacher tenure in his myriad speeches on education reform.
</P>
<P>
   Before giving his address, Kerry met Monday with key
teachers-union leaders to brief them on his proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the speech, Kerry returns repeatedly to the theme of
a thick and ancient bureaucracy standing in the way of progress in
public schools. He said school systems are top-heavy with managers
who direct classroom activities and set regulations from a
headquarters building distant from any school, and they are often
inhibited by powerful teachers unions trying to protect their own.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry plans to say that under the current system, accomplished
scholars such as Goodwin might be able to teach in public schools
but first must cut through a tangle of red tape. In another example
of such an obstacle, he said  &UR;  &LR; Massachusetts school officials have
greater freedom to dismiss unqualified teachers but still are
required to muddle through a series of cumbersome steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, the resistance to accountability and creativity
is too evident all across the nation,'' Kerry says in the speech.
</P>
<P>
   In Kerry's vision, public school principals would be given
immense powers to recruit and hire new teachers and fire those
deemed to be lacking. He proposed higher salaries, but provided no
clear mechanism for how to raise the money.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher certification process would be whittled down to
attract more and better graduates from liberal arts colleges and
not be limited to those who majored in education, according to the
Kerry plan. He will note that education majors as a group fared
below average on college entrance exams.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said in most school districts only college graduates with
a degree in education are eligible to be hired _ unlike most
private schools, where liberal arts majors are often considered to
be the best job candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe every principal in this country ought to have the
same right as headmasters at private schools, to hire a liberal
arts graduate as a teacher and to measure competency,'' the speech
reads.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry plans to say that the federal government must step in with
an unspecified amount of emergency matching grants to help bring
poorer school districts up to par with wealthier ones. He noted
that states that fund school districts through local property taxes
are being increasingly challenged in the courts. Thirteen states
have been ordered to develop new funding plans, Kerry plans to say.
``It is in the interest of all Americans to do so,'' the speech
says. ``Otherwise, we'll keep the status quo alive.''
</P>
<P>
   On other fronts, Kerry proposes recruiting business executives
to serve on school committees and offer help with financial issues
and having companies loan workers to schools to teach. He plans
``second chance'' schools for violent offenders to separate them
from other students but still give them a venue for learning.
</P>
<P>
   Though his most significant proposals involve limiting the
protections given to teachers, Kerry says in his speech, ``Let's be
clear, we don't need teacher-bashing. Many of the limitations on
teachers are ones that we put there.''

POOR COMMUNICATION IN MILITARY BEFORE SKI LIFT INCIDENT DESCRIBED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. _ Four months before a Marine jet hit a ski
lift cable in the Italian alps, communications of safety
information between the Marines and the Air Force was so poor that
a Marine plane once came nose to nose with two Air Force fighters
flying the same route, according to an internal Marine memorandum
introduced in legal proceedings here Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The memo was introduced on the opening day of a hearing to
determine what charges should be brought against the pilot and
navigator of the Marine jet that on Feb. 3 accidentally severed the
cable, causing 20 people to fall to their deaths near Cavalese,
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Capt. Richard J. Ashby, 32, and the navigator, Capt.
Joseph Schweitzer, 30, were in the front of the EA-6B Prowler jet.
A similar hearing was held last month for the two officers in the
rear cockpit, Capt. William L. Raney 2d, 26, and Capt. Chandler P.
Seagraves, 28. No ruling has yet been issued on the rear cockpit
officers.
</P>
<P>
   This hearing is different in character, though, because Ashby
and Schweitzer had direct responsibility for flying and navigating.
Also, the captains in Monday's hearing both have high-powered
civilian lawyers: Ashby is represented by Frank Spinner, who
recently defended Air Force 1st Lt. Kelly Flinn, the B-52 pilot
accused of adultery. Schweitzer has chosen David L. Beck, a retired
Marine Corps judge and aviator who represented Clayton Lonetree,
the Marine sergeant who was convicted of espionage at the Moscow
embassy where he was a guard.
</P>
<P>
   The private lawyers used the memo to touch on the sensitive
question of whether officers more senior than the crew of the plane
itself should also face court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   The memo complained that no one in the Marines took the
near-collision, for which no date or other details were provided,
as a warning to improve communications and weed out the
contradictory and incomplete information that Marine pilots had for
their low-level missions. The Prowler squadrons, brought in to
conduct electronic warfare over Bosnia, rotated through every six
months and counted on the Air Force for local flight information,
according to testimony here. But the Marines lacked a systematic
way to get new information, purge old information and assure that
everyone in the squadron had read the appropriate documents.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. B.E. Bronars wrote the memo to his superior, Maj. Gen.
Michael D. Ryan, who is in charge of the Second Marine Air Wing,
including all four Prowler squadrons. ``I was somewhat surprised
that, as a result of that incident, no one apparently sought out
what other policies may exist that could result in similar or more
dire events,'' Bronars wrote in the memo, dated Sept. 12, 1997. But
his memo itself seems to have been ignored; Monday the commander of
the Prowler squadron involved in the accident, Lt. Col. Richard
Muegge, testified that he had never seen it.
</P>
<P>
   Bad communication was a key factor in the ski lift accident in
Italy. The Air Force had warned its own pilots of a local rule of
not flying below 2,000 feet, but the paperwork on file in the
Marine office gave minimum altitudes ranging down to 500 feet.
Muegge testified again Monday that he thought the minimum was 1,000
feet. Several officers of the squadron have testified that they did
not realize that they were routinely violating the rules until they
searched their files just after the accident. Muegge, who is facing
``Non-judicial punishment,'' is among those who testified that they
never received an e-mail that specified speed restrictions on the
route.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bronars' memo said that the Marine squadron's operations
department ``failed to ensure that there was sufficient
documentation and reference sources available for air crew to
adequately plan and execute low-level training missions.'' But, he
wrote, most of the crews were satisfied with the information on
hand, and this showed complacency about safety, even after the
head-to-head encounter with the two Air Force F-16s. Such
approaches are feared by pilots because closure rates are so high;
Prowlers routinely fly at 7 or 8 miles a minute and F-16s even
faster, meaning that such planes could go from one mile apart to a
collision in four seconds or less. At low altitude, there is little
room to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Air Force apparently had established that the routes be
flown in opposite directions on odd numbered days,'' Bronars said
in the memo, ``The Prowler squadron was unaware of that policy and,
up to that point, flew those routes the same direction, regardless
of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides introducing the memo, the lawyers for two crewmen also
aggressively questioned witnesses Monday on whether officers who
now face charges in the case, including Muegge, had access to
crucial evidence, like the accordion file with flight information,
before it was taken into custody.

NAVAJO MEDICINE TOOK KNOWLEDGE OF CEREMONIES TO GRAVE WITH HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL DONOVAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. _ Nevy Jensen is gone, and with him has
passed a precious store of traditional Navajo knowledge that will
be difficult or impossible to replace, according to his friends and
to officials of the Navajo Nation.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen, 80, one of the most respected medicine men on the Navajo
Indian Reservation, died in a car accident this month on Arizona
89. He had lived most of his life in the Gray Mountain and Cameron
areas of the reservation north of Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the average medicine man knows one or two
ceremonies, officials said, Jensen knew several, including the
Blessingway, (CORRECT, one wore) the Enemy Way, the Shooting Arrow
Way, the Navajo Window Way and the Outreaching Evil Way.
</P>
<P>
   All are used to bring Navajos back into harmony with nature and
to cure various illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen was one of only a few who knew how to perform the
Shooting Arrow Way, a ceremony devoted to healing tribal members
who have been affected adversely by lightning or storms, said
Johnson Dennison, dean of instruction at Dine College.
</P>
<P>
   Among non-Navajos, Jensen may have been better known in Germany
and Japan than in the United States because he was one of a handful
of medicine men willing to appear on camera and speak about Navajo
ceremonies and traditional healing. He also allowed outsiders to
record some of the chants he used in ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past 20 years, he also became a popular speaker at
conventions and seminars throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was active throughout his life,'' said his daughter,
Darlene Jensen, ``but it seems that he became more active in his
last years because of all of his speaking engagements as well as
his continuing to practice as a medicine man.''
</P>
<P>
   Jensen and Dine College, formerly known as Navajo Community
College, go back a long way.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1960s, when the college was in the planning stages,
officials sought someone willing to share knowledge of ceremonies
and traditional healing. Most medicine men declined, but Jensen
agreed, saying he also would advise students and teachers on the
best way to set up a curriculum for traditional healing.
</P>
<P>
   He did so, his daughter said, because he foresaw a day when
traditional practices would be in danger of being lost forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was ahead of his time on that philosophy,'' said Darlene
Jensen.
</P>
<P>
   And he apparently was right. Today, the average age of a
medicine man is approaching 60, and only one or two new ones are
being certified annually, tribal officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has become so bad that the Navajo Nation recently
has established a training program for medicine men apprentices,
with plans to start the instruction this fall.
</P>
<P>
   It takes from five to 10 years to learn a ceremony, so the tribe
is giving preference to Navajos willing to learn the Shooting Arrow
Way and five other ceremonies now in danger of being lost.
</P>
<P>
   Navajo Nation President Thomas Atcitty said Jensen's death is
even more tragic as tribal officials had hoped he would have played
an important role in the training of young Navajos.
</P>
<P>
   Dennison said many families in the western portion of the
reservation will miss Jensen because of his reputation as someone
who really cared for his patients and wanted to make sure the
ceremony worked.
</P>
<P>
   Many Navajos complain that medicine men today seem to hurry
through ceremonies; Jensen was well known for his slow, careful
style, making sure that the patients understood the stories he was
telling as well as what was needed from them to make the ceremony a
success.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen's reputation was such that tribal officials asked him
many times over the past 40 years to conduct ceremonies for the
tribe or for the Navajo people as a whole, including recent ones at
tribal lands near the San Francisco Peaks.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Alice, 13 children, at least 49
grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. &QL;

NEW YORK TIMES ENTERS CROWDED LOCAL INTERNET MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By SAUL HANSELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Entering a market crowded with some of the biggest
companies in cyberspace, The New York Times Co. said Monday that it
would introduce an Internet service about entertainment,
restaurants and shopping in New York City and its suburbs. The
site, called New York Today, will be available, starting Tuesday,
at www.nytoday.com.
</P>
<P>
   The service will compete with New York Sidewalk from Microsoft,
Digital Cities New York from America Online and Citysearch New York
from Citisearch, a privately held company. All the companies are
seeking a share of the rich market for local advertising, which
includes classified advertising, yellow pages listings, outdoor,
broadcast and print ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local advertising is the biggest and most profitable market
for advertising,'' said Brian Oakes, an analyst with Lehman Bros.
who follows newspapers and Internet companies. ``It is critically
important for newspapers to win the local market, both in print and
online.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers may have an edge over technology companies because of
their history and reputation in the cities they serve, analysts
said. ``One of the problems for all these local arts and
entertainment sites is that they all look the same,'' said Patrick
Keane, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, a New York research
firm. ``The Times has an established brand, while the others have
to build theirs from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Donaghy, the general manager of New York Today, said that
he hoped that the breadth of the news and reviews about New York
events written for The New York Times would distinguish the site
from the competition. But Donaghy, said the company expected that
the most important advantage would be technology that allows each
user to customize the service to see both information and
advertising related to the user's own interests.
</P>
<P>
   The site is designed to look like an appointment calendar, with
weather forecasts, arts events and other information listed by
date.
</P>
<P>
   In one unusual feature, advertisers can have their sales and
other promotional events mixed in with the arts and entertainment
listings. Users can see a list of these sales and, if they choose,
have sales for categories of their choice displayed when they first
enter the site.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the calendar listings, New York Today has a
number of other close links between advertising and the site's
editorial content. For example, a user who searches the classified
advertising listings of The Times for, say, condominiums in
Greenwich Village will also see advertisements offering listings of
the same type of property from several real estate brokers.
</P>
<P>
   That advertising will be marked as such and displayed in red
type, while editorial content will be in blue type.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Nisenholtz, the president of The New York Times
Electronic Media Co., said that such links were a service to users
in the long tradition of publishing. ``People often buy the
newspaper as much to read the ads as to read the news,'' he said.

   WASHINGTON _ Senator John F. Kerry, in a dramatic break from

``It is in the interest of all Americans to do so,'' the speech
says. ``Otherwise, we'll keep the status quo alive.''
</P>
<P>
   On other fronts, Kerry proposes recruiting business executives
to serve on school committees and offer help with financial issues
and having companies loan workers to schools to teach. He plans
``second chance'' schools for violent offenders to separate them
from other students but still give them a venue for learning.
</P>
<P>
   Though his most significant proposals involve limiting the
protections given to teachers, Kerry says in his speech, ``Let's be
clear, we don't need teacher-bashing. Many of the limitations on
teachers are ones that we put there.''

   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. _ The bronze bust of Paul William ``Bear''
Bryant that glares from the museum's entrance is about five times
life-size, and still might not be quite big enough.
</P>
<P>
   If the sculptor had carved that craggy face on a mountain, maybe
_ a very big mountain _ the likeness of the late University of
Alabama football coach might then be big enough to match the
legend, might satisfy the fans who name children for him 15 years
after his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was,'' said Emily Hornsby, who went to school at Alabama in
1938 and 1939, ``wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   The man that generations of fans just called ``Bear'' has his
own museum here at this green and pretty university in western
Alabama, a place where the coach's legacy is kept dust-free inside
glass trophy cases and on videotape. On a hot June afternoon, the
faithful _ old women, teen-agers and grown men who see him as
something more than mortal _ filed past long-flat footballs and
frayed jerseys and ancient cleats, just remembering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there, in Memphis. I've never been so cold,'' said the
white-haired Mrs. Hornsby, staring up at a black-and-white
photograph of coach Bryant, his deeply lined face peering from a
fur-trimmed hood, at the Liberty Bowl game, his last before
retiring after the 1982 season as the winningest coach in Division
I-A football. He died just a few weeks later, on Jan. 26, 1983.
</P>
<P>
   For a lot of people here in Alabama, it has been cold ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   It is more than football idolatry that this museum holds. For 25
years the coach _ who got his nickname by wrestling a carnival bear
when he was a boy _ gave Alabamians something to be proud of in a
time when the word ``Alabama'' drew scorn and jokes. Coach Bryant
won three national championships in the 1960s _ and six in all _
and made the name ``Alabama'' stand for something good. Alabama was
synonymous with George Wallace _ and racism _ then.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, though he also was criticized for being too slow to
integrate his team, ``gave us something positive to think about,
about ourselves, in a bad time,'' said Kenneth Gaddy, the museum's
director, who grew up listening to Alabama football games on the
radio.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Davis, a teen-ager in the 1960s in Opp, Ala., idolized
Bryant. When he went to war in Vietnam, he walked with pride among
other soldiers because Paul ``Bear'' Bryant and Alabama football
gave him a status that others envied.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could be proud of being from here, no matter where you
went,'' said Davis, who brought his teen-age son, Josh, to the
museum. ``Alabama did us proud, and it all came from him.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his 25 years here as coach, 350 children have been named for
him _ Pauls and Paulas, Williams, Bryants, even a few Bears _
according to a museum database. ``That's just the ones we know
about,'' said Gaddy, the director.
</P>
<P>
   His players built their own legends. Kenny Stabler and Joe
Namath threw touchdown passes for him before pro football made them
heroes on Sunday afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   Namath, under the stern coach, was just another schoolboy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son-in-law was with Joe Namath that night,'' said Mrs.
Hornsby. ``That night'' was in 1963, when Namath broke team rules
by going to a bar and was suspended for the last two games of the
season, including the Sugar Bowl game against Mississippi on New
Year's Day 1964.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they were drinking beer and singing,'' she said, ``in
a bar.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum chronicles the numbers _ including his 323 career
victories and a then-record 15 victories in bowl games _ but the
people who come here already know the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   They come to gaze at the fuzzy houndstooth hat, now under glass,
that was his trademark on the sideline and to smile at the hideous
black-and-white plaid couch that once sat in his office.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a Waterford crystal copy of the hat, which
glitters in one case like a massive jewel.
</P>
<P>
   It seems a little fancy for a man who was born in Kingsland,
Ark., on Sept. 11, 1913, and who rode to the University of Alabama
in the rumble seat of a Model T in 1933, lettered in football then
returned there to coach in 1958. Bryant, when asked about his
success, would sometimes just mumble that he was proud not to be
plowing.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, like the legend it contains, shows no warts. There
are no exhibits to the common knowledge that the man liked his
whiskey, no reference to an accusation that he once conspired with
a University of Georgia coach to fix a game. People here will not
even entertain that talk. One does not spit in church.
</P>
<P>
   A common refrain here is ``Things ain't the same, since the Bear
died.'' On Interstate 59, heading in to Tuscaloosa, a billboard for
the Bryant museum promises otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Paul William Bryant Museum,'' it reads. ``Where the Season
Never Ends.''

NEW JERSEY TO PUT CAMERAS IN ALL STATE POLICE CARS ON TOLL ROADS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Responding to an outcry over the shooting of
three young men by state troopers on the New Jersey Turnpike in
April, Gov. Christie Whitman said on Monday that all 245 state
police cruisers that patrol New Jersey's toll roads would be
equipped with video cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and other officials said the decision to install
the cameras was intended to meet demands from both the public and
the state police that a more watchful eye be used to record exactly
what happens when troopers pull over drivers. After the incident in
April, in which two state troopers shot and wounded three men in a
van, the troopers said the van's driver had been speeding. The men
and their lawyers said the van had been singled out because its
occupants were black and Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations that the troopers were engaged in racial
``profiling'' _ the practice of stopping a motor vehicle based on
the race of its occupants in hopes of seizing narcotics or other
contraband _ prompted civil rights advocates to demand the on-board
cameras, which are used by many state police agencies nationwide
and by more than 80 municipal police departments in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly with the most recent incident, it was clear that it
was something we should move forward with,'' Whitman said on Monday
afternoon at a Manhattan news conference after speaking at a
biotechnology industry convention there. She called the cameras
``very important for law enforcement and public confidence'' and
said they would provide ``noncontrovertible evidence of what
happens when a police stop is made.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said the authorities that govern the state's three toll
roads _ the New Jersey Turnpike, the Garden State Parkway and the
Atlantic City Expressway _would pay a total of $1 million to
install the cameras, using money from their operating budgets. U.S.
Sen. Robert Torricelli said he would press the Justice Department
for additional funds to install cameras in all 785 state police
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This offers protection both to the police who want to prove
that they are operating within existing rules and people who want
to prove that they are occasionally victimized,'' Torricelli said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's announcement was applauded by the Rev. Reginald
Jackson, executive director of the statewide Black Ministers
Council, which has urged state officials to prevent profile stops,
and by Col. Carl Williams, superintendent of the state police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I commend the governor and the attorney general,'' Jackson
said. ``This is a positive first step.'' He also said black clergy
members wanted assurances that the video cameras would turn on
automatically and not be operated manually by the troopers.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said the specifications of the recording
equipment have yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   The incident on April 23, in which Troopers James Kenna and John
Hogan shot three men on their way to a basketball clinic at a North
Carolina college, is under investigation by a special state
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Williams said video cameras ``serve to provide
an even greater margin of safety to state troopers, police officers
and the public served.''

WHITMAN'S DAUGHTER CITED FOR LITTERING 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Kate Whitman, the 21-year-old daughter of Gov.
Christie Whitman, was issued a citation for littering in Bethlehem,
Pa., over the weekend after tossing a beer can in front of a police
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said that her daughter was visiting friends at Lehigh
University and seemed ``to have had a lapse of judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have discussed the matter with my daughter and, like any
other parent, I am concerned about the littering charge and Kate's
alleged behavior,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Whitman, who lives with her parents in Oldwick, was walking
down a street with three friends at 1:30 a.m. on Saturday when a
police officer stopped her and told her to get rid of a beer can
that she was holding, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   The police officer left, but later returned to find Ms. Whitman
with the beer can still in her hand. After she tossed it on the
ground, the police officer issued a citation and she was
handcuffed, the A.P. said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said that her daughter had been respectful to the police
officer, but was handcuffed after she had questioned why she was
being ordered into the back seat of the police cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the wrong thing to do,'' Mrs. Whitman said. ``She
questioned him as only my daughter can.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate Whitman faces a fine of $50 to $300. ``She will pay
whatever fine is imposed,'' Whitman said. &QL;

OUTGOING YOSHII SAYS NOMO HAS CHATTY SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ They seem to be the Japanese Odd Couple. Hideo Nomo and
Masato Yoshii may be best friends, but their outward appearances
could not be any more disparate.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo does his news conferences stone-faced. Answers of more than
a few words are considered garrulous. Yoshii, on the other hand, is
just as likely to hit his interviewer with a one-liner as he is to
respond with in-depth analysis. He smiles frequently and displays a
warm sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   But Yoshii swears that there is another side to Nomo, one that
is not easily seen in a public setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a talkative person,'' Yoshii said through his
interpreter, Bob Norton, after Nomo had just tossed six shutout
innings Sunday afternoon in the Mets' loss to the Marlins, his
second start with New York. ``He's funny, just like anybody else in
the clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   But it looks as if Nomo has watched the scene in the movie
``Bull Durham'' where Kevin Costner teaches Tim Robbins the
importance of using cliches when dealing with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Not that a colorful public persona is a prerequisite of being a
successful major leaguer. As Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said
after Nomo's performance Sunday, ``If Nomo pitches like that, we'll
be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some samples of Nomo's post-game news conference on
Sunday after the Mets' bullpen had blown a 4-0 lead in a 5-4 loss
to the lowly Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   _ Was that your best performance of the season? ``No, it was
not.''
</P>
<P>
   _ What was your best performance this season? ``I can't
remember,'' he said with a rare laugh.
</P>
<P>
   _ How much has it helped having Yoshii on the team? ``Having him
on my team is definitely a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomo can use more than a few words when he wants to. When asked
how it affected him to pitch in the overbearing heat and humidity
of a South Florida summer afternoon, Nomo said: ``That's hard to
explain. The heat, the humidity and also the sun, it was like being
in an oven. Then you have the pressure of the game. So it is pretty
hard to explain.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is a far cry from Yoshii saying this spring that Mark
McGwire is big, ``like Godzilla.'' Or, earlier this season, when he
said that he half expected McGwire to start breathing fire at him.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Yoshii might be more comfortable answering questions
is that Nomo came under criticism by the Japanese news media when
he jumped to the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really talked with him, but maybe there is an effect
from the way he was treated in Japan,'' Yoshii said. ``The Japanese
media seem to exaggerate a lot of stuff, expect certain answers,
come up with their own conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that way, maybe he is a little more guarded.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Yoshii?
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, I don't really care what they write,'' he said, with a
laugh, of course.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   HEAR THIS: WE WANT HUNDLEY
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hundley believes deep down that he will be traded in the
off season. But Fred Wilpon on Monday once again emphasized that he
and the co-owner, Nelson Doubleday, would like to have Hundley and
Mike Piazza on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that is the way we feel,'' Wilpon said.
``And not only the ownership, but the baseball people. Todd playing
on the same team with Mike would give us the best possible
offensive team on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilpon added: ``Todd has this in his mind. But hopefully that
will all be dissipated. People know I have a special regard for
Todd and the way he plays the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to General Manager Steve Phillips, Wilpon said: ``It
is up to Steve and his people to figure out how and where both
Hundley and Piazza would be able to play in the same lineup
together. Yes, I think something can work.''
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   FEELING THE VOID?
</P>
<P>
   One of the interesting twists in the collapse of the Mets'
bullpen in a 5-4 defeat to the Marlins on Sunday and a 4-3 loss to
them on Friday night, was that Greg McMichael, whom the Mets dealt
to the Dodgers in the Nomo trade, would probably have been called
upon to hold the leads for Nomo and Yoshii.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets allowed the tying runs in the eighth innings of both
games, and the winning runs in the ninth inning both times.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Dennis Cook and the closer John Franco, the bullpen
has struggled, having had tough times in the extremely important
setup innings. John Hudek lost both games.
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell allowed a costly hit Friday. Mel Rojas has been
unable to nail down third outs and Brian Bohanon has been
victimized by hard luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to settle it out and fill that void,'' Manager
Bobby Valentine said of the shuffling of roles he is trying to
accomplish in the bullpen in the absence of McMichael. ``We'll get
it done. But we need a little time to get settled.''
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   GOOD REPORT FOR GILKEY
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Gilkey, who was hit above the left eye with a pitch
Friday night, saw another eye doctor Monday as a precautionary
measure. No new damage was found. &QL;

 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Renewed fears that Asia's economic crisis will stall
growth in the profits of American companies sent U.S. stocks
plunging on Monday, the worst in a string of recent sell-offs that
has now erased the gains of the last three months for the Dow Jones
industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   Since crossing the 9,000 mark in April _ a level almost 1,100
points above where the blue-chip average began the year _ the Dow
has faced trouble sustaining that height.
</P>
<P>
   The widely followed barometer of the nation's top industrial
companies fell 207.01 points on Monday, to 8,627.93, a 2.3 percent
drop that left it down 6.3 percent from its record high. Some other
market gauges have fallen even more, suggesting that a stock market
correction _ a drop of 10 percent or more _ is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are increasingly concerned that Asia has yet to reach
the bottom of its economic cycle. Signs of distress there are not
only persistent, but deepening.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, which many hoped would be the region's rescuer, announced
last week that its economy shrank sharply in the quarter that ended
in March, amounting to its steepest annualized decline since World
War II. The yen, a barometer of Japan's economic weakness, fell to
an eight-year low against the dollar Monday, further elevating
fears throughout Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Prices on the Japanese stock market and at other exchanges
across Asia fell sharply in response, setting the stage for a
decline when trading began on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're really seeing is a truly global market,'' said
Anthony Conroy, a managing director at Bankers Trust Global
Investment Management. ``If you catch a cold in Asia, it really
becomes a flu almost everywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   For American companies that do business in Japan and throughout
Asia, the prospects are growing dimmer for a recovery anytime soon.
Monday, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, the maker of Post-it
notes and Scotchguard fabric protector, became the latest American
company to warn investors that earnings would be disappointing this
quarter because of Asian problems.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, analysts predicted that global companies
would be hurt in the first half of the year by Asia's troubles, but
that earnings would pick up in the second half. Now, more and more
analysts are pushing back their estimates of a recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Although companies have been reluctant to say much about how
Asia will lower earnings, Boeing, National Semiconductor, Ford,
Callaway Golf, and Analog Devices have all hinted that their
profits will continue to be pinched in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Through Friday, 64 percent of the companies that have warned
analysts to revise their profit projections for the second quarter
have suggested that the estimates be lowered, according to First
Call Corp., a Boston-based firm that tracks analysts' earnings
estimates. In an average quarter, only 57 percent of companies give
such negative outlooks, First Call said.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, analysts now expect profits at the companies in
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 to rise 9.2 percent, down from a 13.9
percent estimate at the beginning of the year, according to a
survey by First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Those projections may still prove optimistic. Profits in the S&AMP;P
500 actually rose 3.8 percent in the first quarter and are now
expected to climb 4.7 percent in the second quarter, First Call
said. That estimate is down considerably since the first of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   A flight to quality has helped the American financial markets
all year, but only the Treasury market benefitted on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, the Nikkei 225 average of Japanese stocks fell 1.3
percent Monday. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index was off 5.72
percent to its lowest level since Jan. 30, 1995. European stock
markets fell as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asia is a double-edged sword,'' said Charles Johnson, head
equity trader at Blaylock &AMP; Partners in Baltimore. The problems
have dimmed the possibility that the Federal Reserve would soon
raise interest rates _ a rise is considered negative for the market
_ but ``the other edge is corporate profits,'' which may be lower
than expected.
</P>
<P>
   In uncertain times, U.S. Treasuries are seen as a haven, and
Monday a surge in demand for bonds sent the yield on the bellwether
30-year Treasury to record lows. Price increases also pushed down
the yields on most other bonds.
</P>
<P>
   In the stock market, bargain hunters moved in at midday, but
sellers swamped the buyers at the end of the day. The 207-point
fall was the fifth-biggest ever for the Dow average, but in
percentage terms, the 2.3 percent decline was not among even its 20
worst days. The average is still up 9.1 percent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Some stock analysts said that the blue-chip stock gauge was
merely beginning to reflect the declines already evident in the
broader market.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, laden with technology stocks, fell
29.30 points Monday to 1,715.75, a 1.68 percent decline for the
day. It is now off 10.5 percent from its April 22 high.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index, another broad stock market gauge, fell
7.73 points Monday and is now off 11.7 percent from its high on
April 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall stock market is acting much more poorly than the
blue chip indexes,'' said Steve Shobin, chief technical analyst at
Lehman Brothers. ``Yes, there's really a correction going on.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a Salomon Smith Barney study, through June 2, more
than 43 percent of the stocks in the Nasdaq composite index had
declined 30 percent or more from their 52-week highs. That compares
with 10.2 percent of stocks in the S&AMP;P 500 and almost 18 percent of
the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. During the same period,
the average decline in a Nasdaq stock has been 30.1 percent from
their 52-week high.
</P>
<P>
   When looking at stocks with price declines of at least 10
percent _ the usual measure of a correction _ the percentages are
even higher. Eighty four percent of Nasdaq stocks are off that
amount, as are more than 58 percent of S&AMP;P stocks and almost 69
percent of those traded on the New York Stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Shobin of Lehman Bros. said his indicators point to more trouble
ahead. Fewer stocks are posting new highs now than in mid-April, he
said, and trading volume has been declining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most corrections do not end until volume rises sharply,'' he
said.

DISABLED STATE INMATES PROTECTED BY ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAW
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Disabled state prisoners are covered by the federal
law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities,
the Supreme Court ruled unanimously Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The justices rejected an argument put forward by Pennsylvania,
and backed by most other states, that Congress could not have meant
to interfere with the ``historic sovereign function of state prison
management'' when it enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act of
1990. Title II of that law applies to government programs,
prohibiting any ``public entity'' from discriminating against a
``qualified individual with a disability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The statute's language unmistakably includes state prisons and
prisoners within its coverage,'' Justice Antonin Scalia said in his
opinion for the court. Noting that Congress referred in general
terms to barring discrimination in the ``services, programs, or
activities'' run by public agencies, Scalia said the law's text
``provides no basis for distinguishing these programs, services,
and activities from those provided by public entities that are not
prisons.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision upheld a ruling last year by the federal appeals
court in Philadelphia on behalf of an inmate whose hypertension
cost him a place in a boot camp program that would have led to a
speedy parole. The inmate, Ronald Yeskey, sued state prison
officials on the grounds that his exclusion on the basis of his
medical condition violated the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Yeskey, a first-time offender who was convicted of drunken
driving, resisting arrest and other offenses, eventually served 32
months in prison. Had he successfully completed the boot camp
program, he would have been paroled after six months. His lawyer,
Donald Specter, said Monday that Yeskey would now seek damages from
the state from the extra confinement.
</P>
<P>
   While the decision Monday, an unusually brief six pages, left no
doubt about the proper interpretation of the disability act, it may
not end the debate over the statute's application to the states.
California has been litigating a separate, constitutionally based
challenge to the law's application to state prisons, arguing that
Congress lacked the authority to extend the law to the states and
to breach state immunity from suit in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   While the state lost its case in the lower federal courts in
California, Gov. Pete Wilson has appealed to the Supreme Court, and
the justices are likely to announce shortly whether they will hear
that case, Wilson vs. Armstrong, No. 97-686.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion Monday, Pennsylvania vs. Yeskey, No. 97-634,
Scalia made a brief reference to the constitutional questions while
noting that because the lower courts had decided the case purely on
the grounds of statutory interpretation, the Supreme Court would
not address the further issues. But it is possible that some
justices _ including Scalia, who wrote the 5-to-4 decision last
year that struck down the Brady gun control law on state
sovereignty grounds _ might be interested in using the prison case
as a vehicle for the court's ongoing federalism debate.
</P>
<P>
   The lower federal courts had been in dispute over whether, as a
matter of statutory interpretation, the law applied to state
prisons. Suits have been brought around the country on behalf of
prisoners with a wide range of conditions, including deafness,
paralysis, mental retardation and chronic disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration entered this case on behalf of the
inmate, asking the court to uphold the ruling of the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department regulations have long viewed the disability
act as well as an earlier law, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as
applicable to state prisons.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   There were also these other developments at the court Monday:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Silence at Sentencing  &QL; 
 &LR;  Accepting an appeal from a Pennsylvania inmate, the court agreed
to decide whether the Fifth Amendment right against compelled
self-incrimination applies at a sentencing proceeding as well as at
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The question is a surprisingly unsettled one, and it is of
growing importance, given the increasing use of mandatory minimum
sentences that often depend on fairly precise factual
determinations, such as the quantities of illegal drugs a defendant
bought or sold.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Mitchell vs. United States, No. 97-7541, a woman
who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine did not
speak at her sentencing hearing to rebut the government's evidence
of the quantities involved. The trial judge told the woman, Amanda
Mitchell, that her failure to testify was a factor in his decision
to give her the maximum 10-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In upholding the sentence, the third circuit held that the Fifth
Amendment right to remain silent did not apply at sentencing
because ``if a defendant's testimony cannot incriminate her, she
cannot claim a Fifth Amendment privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   In her Supreme Court appeal, Ms. Mitchell's lawyer is arguing
that because 90 percent of criminal defendants plead guilty,
``sentencing is frequently of greater importance than the question
of guilt or innocence'' and defendants must be able to protect
themselves against admitting additional crimes at the sentencing
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Court Jurisdiction  &QL; 
 &LR;  The court issued an important ruling on the 1996 federal law that
limited prisoners' rights to habeas corpus review. By a vote of
5-4, the court upheld its own jurisdiction to review the denial, by
a federal court of appeals, of an inmate's right to appeal an
adverse ruling by a federal district court.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 law, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty
Act, Congress provided that inmates could appeal their habeas
corpus cases only by special permission of the court of appeals. So
the question for the justices Monday was whether the denial of what
is known as a certificate of appealability can itself be appealed
to the Supreme Court. Habeas corpus is the means by which federal
courts review the constitutionality of convictions or sentences.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of federal law, the Supreme Court has jurisdiction
to review only those cases that are ``in'' the appeals courts. The
technical issue in this case, Hohn vs. United States, No. 96-8986,
was whether an application for the certificate met that definition.
</P>
<P>
   In holding that it did, the majority overturned a 1945 precedent
that had suggested otherwise. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the
majority opinion, joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, David
Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our rule permits us to carry out our normal function of
reviewing possible misapplications of law by the courts of appeals
without having to resort to extraordinary measures,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Scalia objected that the majority
``ignores the obvious intent'' of the 1996 law, which he said ``was
to eliminate the interminable delays in the execution of state and
Federal criminal sentences, and the shameful overloading of our
federal criminal justice system, produced by various aspects of
this Court's habeas corpus jurisprudence.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist, along with Clarence Thomas and
Sandra Day O'Connor, joined Scalia.

ADVERTISING: ZIFF-DAVIS PUSHES ZDTV  
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ziff-davis, the high-technology media and marketing company, has
introduced a 24-hour cable television network focused on computing
and the Internet and is counting on a multimillion-dollar
advertising campaign to put it on the map.
</P>
<P>
   Ziff-Davis Inc., which is 70 percent owned by Softbank Corp.,
the Japanese computer company, introduced the network, ZDTV, last
month. Ziff-Davis is investing $100 million in the network over a
two-year period, ending early next year, including an estimated $10
million for the advertising campaign. Ziff-Davis is based in New
York, ZDTV in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which was developed by Blazing Paradigm in San
Francisco, is directed at three audiences: cable affiliates, which
Ziff-Davis is wooing to carry the network's programming; potential
viewers, whom Ziff-Davis hopes will watch the programming and also
ask their cable operators to carry it, and potential advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Ziff-Davis has signed agreements with 17 cable
operators in 15 states, most recently with DirectTV Inc., a unit of
Hughes Electronic Corp., which has more than 3.6 million
subscribers. By the end of this month, ZDTV expects to be available
in 6 million homes.
</P>
<P>
   The creative work for the ad campaign is largely the same for
all three audiences. Written in a somewhat humorous tone with an
edge, the advertising ``tries to capture the personality and
attitude of the channel,'' said Sam Pond, creative director of
Blazing Paradigm. ``The ads have to show that it's not a geek
pointing to a motherboard, that the channel has the spirit and
energy technology has today.''
</P>
<P>
   A 30-second television spot announces that ``as we launch the
future of computer entertainment, we'd like to take a moment to
reflect on the past,'' then cuts first to footage of a ``Pong''
video game, popular 20 years ago, and next to a montage of photos
of the new ZDTV shows. All print ads depict television sets
floating in empty rooms, with various ZDTV programs on their
screens. One ad asks, ``If food gets its own channel, why shouldn't
computers?'' while another says: ``Introducing a TV network all
about computing and the Internet. (And to think television used to
be called the idiot box.)''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisements geared toward cable affiliates and advertisers
are running in industry publications. The cable ads will continue,
but the advertisers' campaign will run only at the time of the
network's introduction. Print advertising for viewers is running
through this month on the television listings page of The Wall
Street Journal, and in the June and July issues of Wired, Red
Herring, Upside and Fast Company. It is also running indefinitely
in the 17 Ziff-Davis computer magazines for the U.S. market, which
include PC magazine, Internet Computing and Yahoo! Internet Life.
The television ad, also geared toward viewers, is appearing
indefinitely on MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   An unusual component of the advertising is a direct response
campaign on the company's web site (ZDNet.com) and on the network's
web site (ZDTV.com). It asks prospective viewers to have their
local cable operator ``ZDTV me'' by filling out a form and
expressing their interest in the network. Ziff-Davis will forward
the form to the operator. Greg Jarboe, a company spokesman, said
that 17,000 people had completed the form as of early June.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Larry Gerbrandt, a senior analyst at Paul Kagan Associates, a
Carmel, Calif., consulting firm, who follows the cable industry,
said that although ``Ziff-Davis has staked out some territory here
that's been underserved, right now it's all about carriage.'' He
added, ``They've got to get shelf space.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the company's $10 million budget ``a useful amount of
money, enough to get them on radar screens.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nail, a senior analyst at Forrester Research Inc. in
Cambridge, Mass., called the Ziff-Davis online petition initiative
superb, saying, ``People on the site are exactly the audience for
the TV programming.'' Still, he added, ``The big question in my
mind is whether instead of watching `Baywatch,' consumers will
watch programs about computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts, recalling less than spectacular earlier forays
into cable by Ziff-Davis and its rivals, questioned the network's
prospects. Ziff-Davis produced a show called ``The Site'' for MSNBC
that the latter canceled last fall after 16 months, when it
switched to an all-news format. Jones Education Co. of Denver
killed its computer network in 1996, after two years. Andy
Holdgate, a spokesman, said that it could not persuade enough cable
operators to carry it.
</P>
<P>
   Halsey Minor, chairman and chief executive officer of Cnet, a
San Francisco-based high-technology media company, said: ``The
question is whether ZDTV will be able to do the programming that
delivers on their marketing. They're taking a huge gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   Cnet, which once considered creating a 24-hour high-technology
cable network but ultimately opted not to do so, produces four
computer-related television shows shown on the Sci-Fi Channel and
USA Network.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Kurnit, chief executive officer of Mining Co., a network
of special interest Internet Web sites, and the former president of
Viewer's Choice, a pay-per-view cable network, was more sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stars line up for me; I think this network is around for
the long haul,'' he said. ``They ought to win with their
distribution plan because they're giving cable operators a way to
position themselves as more technologically savvy.''

DOES YZERMAN RATE THE MVP AWARD? 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The pre-game conversations had a post-game tone.
With the Detroit Red Wings leading the Washington Capitals by three
games to none in the Stanley Cup finals, the questions were less
about Tuesday's Game 4 than about what might happen if Detroit
captures its second consecutive championship.
</P>
<P>
   Will Steve Yzerman win the Conn Smythe trophy as the most
valuable player in the post-season tournament? If the center does
not, it will be almost as big an upset as a four-game winning
streak in the next week by the Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Will Detroit Coach Scotty Bowman return next season to try to
break Toe Blake's coaching record of eight cup winners? The Red
Wings' general manager, Ken Holland, and most others around the
team expect that he will be back.
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman leads the tournament in points with 24. The only other
candidates for the Smythe award would be Nicklas Lidstrom, the
Detroit defenseman who is second with 19 points, and Sergei
Fedorov, the Detroit center who is tied for third with 18 and leads
everyone in goals with 10. But no European has ever won the trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Named after a Toronto Maple Leafs executive, the trophy bears a
maple leaf and a miniature Maple Leaf Gardens. Given out since
1965, the only non-Canadian to win the award was the Rangers' Brian
Leetch, an American, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman, who grew up near Ottawa, didn't discourage speculation
that he was the favorite, but he wasn't gloating either. Asked who
would get his vote, Yzerman replied: ``Obviously, I'd like to pick
someone from my own team.'' The two he mentioned were goalie Chris
Osgood and Lidstrom. ``I don't really want to start thinking about
other things,'' Yzerman said.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-year veteran, Yzerman has changed his playing style in
recent seasons. Earlier in his career, he was primarily an
attacker. Now, he gets back to cover his own end of the ice. He
checks opponents, cuts off their skating angles, blocks shots and
displays a well-rounded style.
</P>
<P>
   Knee injuries and age have taken some of his skating speed. His
hand quickness on scoring chances is not what it once was. The
arrival of Russian centers like Fedorov and Igor Larionov may have
taken some of the pressure off Yzerman to carry the offensive
burden while demonstrating to him the dual responsibilities of
centers trained in the Russian style. Another factor was the
arrival of Bowman, who demanded defensive consciousness from
forwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't really say that to me specifically,'' Yzerman said.
``It was a statement to the team. What he didn't say is `If you
don't, you're not going to play.' That was implied.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman, asked about Yzerman's Smythe chances, said: ``I'm sure
he's not thinking about it.'' But he added: ``I'm sure he'll take
it if it's there and I'm sure he'll take it with a lot of modesty.
That's the way he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman has another year on his contract, at his option. ``I
don't know what I want to do right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holland, the general manager, said he expected Bowman would work
at least a sixth season in Detroit. ``My feeling right now is he's
coming back,'' Holland said. ``I find it hard to believe he's not
going to want to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many factors favoring a return by Bowman and a
continuation of the Red Wings' winning ways.
</P>
<P>
   They have reached the finals in three of the last four seasons.
None of their key players will be free agents this summer, except
for Slava Fetisov, 40, the veteran defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   The Wings have remarkable depth, particularly at the forward
positions, with young players making strong impressions. Left wing
Tomas Holmstrom, 25, in his second NHL season, is tied with Fedorov
with 18 playoff points. Right wing Martin Lapointe, 24, is second
behind Fedorov in playoff goals with eight. (Yzerman is tied for
eighth in goals with six.)
</P>
<P>
   On defense, the Wings are weaker than they were last spring,
mostly because of the serious injuries suffered by Vladimir
Konstantinov in a limousine crash. Lidstrom is a candidate for the
Norris trophy as the league's best defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   In goal, Osgood has been adequate, particularly in this series,
because his teammates have held the Capitals to as few as one shot
a period.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals, making the first final-round appearance in their
24-year history, have played respectably, losing all three games by
one goal. Aside from goalie Olaf Kolzig and the members of the
muscle man line of Dale Hunter-Chris Simon-Craig Berube, no
Washington player has had an outstanding series.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Wilson, the coach, has tried to keep his sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love coming to the rink every day. So what, we are down
three to nothing,'' Wilson said. ``You know, if we lose on Tuesday,
I don't believe a firing squad is going to show up at my house and
put me down. Although, in this league, the last three or four
coaches who have lost in the finals have been fired.'' &QL;

ASSEMBLY DEMOCRATS FILE SUIT CHALLENGING VETOES BY PATAKI 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Setting the stage for a constitutional showdown,
the Democrats who control the State Assembly filed a lawsuit on
Monday challenging Gov. George Pataki's decision to veto dozens of
items from the budget that the legislature enacted two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, centers
on the legal question of whether the governor overstepped his
authority in April when he went beyond vetoing individual
appropriations. He also struck passages from provisions known as
language bills, which set state policy and specify how money is to
be spent.
</P>
<P>
   In their suit, the Democratic leaders of the Assembly contend
that the governor's veto authority is limited to appropriations and
does not extend to altering language bills. They said his decision
to alter more than 50 language bills was unconstitutional and
undermined the law-making authority of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``These vetoes are beyond his budget authority and are unique in
state history,'' Sheldon Silver of Manhattan, the Democratic
speaker of the Assembly, said in a news conference in the Capitol
on Monday afternoon. ``No other governor has ever attempted to
challenge this constitutional prohibition.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is just the latest sign of how relations have become
severely strained between Pataki, a Republican, and Silver, the
governor's main rival in the legislature. The two men have rarely
met in recent weeks even though the legislative session is
scheduled to end on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The suit drew an angry response from the Pataki administration.
``This is a blatantly partisan and political act,'' Michael McKeon,
a spokesman for the governor, said. ``But unfortunately, that is
what we have come to expect from the speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority leader of the Republican-led Senate, Joseph Bruno,
an ally of the governor, expressed disappointment with the suit,
saying it was unproductive. He called on all sides to negotiate to
restore some of the programs that Pataki vetoed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate the legislature and the executive can't work
together to resolve the differences over budget language, the
budget process and related issues without resorting to legal
action,'' said Bruno, of Rensselaer County, in a statement released
by his office.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Pataki struck more than 1,000 items from the budget
that the legislature sent him, cutting $760 million in new spending
for this year and $800 million in borrowing for future years. The
vetoes were the governor's way of seizing control of the budget
process after both the Assembly and the Senate took the
unprecedented step of adopting the budget without his involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The suit filed on Monday does not seek to restore any of the
money the governor cut from the budget. Democrats acknowledge that
the governor has the line-item veto authority over appropriations
in the budget.
</P>
<P>
   But the suit does challenge the governor's decision to strike
language from bills that do not appropriate money, but outline how,
when and where money is to be spent for a variety of programs and
state agencies. Democrats contend that such use of veto power by a
governor is unprecedented and gives Pataki more control over the
budget than the state constitution permits.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, they said, Pataki struck a provision that
detailed how a community college child care program would be
carried out. In another, he vetoed a bill that set up a program
intended to help welfare recipients find jobs. In another instance,
he struck a passage that set eligibility requirements for disabled
workers applying for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``These vetoes are a constitutional expression of the governor's
absolute contempt for the legislature,'' said Richard Brodsky, a
Democratic Assemblyman from Westchester County. ``They essentially

BEFORE CLINTON VISIT, PROPAGANDA MOVIE STARS CHINESE PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ ``Across the Pacific,'' an hourlong documentary on
President Jiang Zemin's state visit to the United States last year,
opened in major theaters around the country Monday, not by
coincidence just 10 days before President Clinton arrives for a
much-heralded reciprocal visit.
</P>
<P>
   This government product, which is playing a few times a day in
several Beijing theaters in between more commonplace Chinese dramas
or Hong Kong B-movies, stars Jiang as a jovial Renaissance man: He
plays the guitar and swims the Pacific surf; he stands beside
Clinton fielding questions from the press; he dazzles a White House
banquet; he wows Harvard by speaking in English; he charms the New
York Stock Exchange, all the while building a new partnership with
America.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is an unusually blatant effort to portray Jiang the
way he wants to be seen, as a relaxed, witty statesman of the top
rank. Even more, in its air-brushed version of Jiang's visit it
portrays the course of Chinese-American relations the way China
wishes it to be _ as on a smooth track to partnership.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to know what China's top leaders really think,
but few people here seem aware of how deeply the recent outbreak in
Washington of China-related charges and scandals, the roiling
accusations of national security braches and illegal campaign
donations, may cut into Clinton's ability to forge stronger ties
just now.
</P>
<P>
   Typical is the attitude of Xu Jianzhong, 66, a retired postal
worker who was one of the few to make the first showing this
morning of ``Across the Pacific'' at a theater near Tiananmen
Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for the world's richest country and the world's
most populous country to have a good relationship,'' he said. ``Of
course President Clinton feels pressures, but he's a statesman and
he won't let them interfere.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that few people here have had a chance to learn
much about the various China-related charges flying about in
Washington, because, for the most part, only short, defensive
rebuttals appear in the media. But even relatively sophisticated
officials, scholars and journalists with access to better
information tend to view the scandals as a plot by anti-Chinese
forces to derail friendly ties.
</P>
<P>
   A typical article last Sunday in People's Daily, the mouthpiece
of the Communist Party, said, ``As President Clinton's visit to
China approaches, some people in the Congress and media have
suddenly fabricated absurd arguments in an attempt to undermine the
healthy development of bilateral relations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people with ulterior motives have alleged that American
security interests have been threatened,'' it added. These people
``must give up the Cold War mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments are often sincerely felt, say Chinese scholars
who know both countries well. The Chinese have become so pragmatic
in their own thinking, some say, that they have a hard time
imagining that a great power would allow little details like an
improper campaign donation to disrupt ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese are now so cynical about ideology,'' said Suisheng
Zhao, an expert on Chinese politics at Colby College in Maine. ``So
they don't believe Americans have their own moral standards
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with a range of Chinese citizens suggest a widely
shared yearning for good relations with the United States, and an
assumption that this will both encourage further political
liberalization in China and give a good boost to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, Clinton's visit will help encourage the opening up
here,'' said Ji Xiangyu, a 21-year-old college student. ``Will it
be easier for us to get a visa to the United States?'' she added
hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from some open political dissidents and relatives of the
hundreds of civilians killed in 1989 when the military suppressed
the Tiananmen demonstrations, the suggestion that Clinton should
avoid the square when he visits Beijing seems to find little
resonance here.
</P>
<P>
   The violence in and around that giant plaza at the heart of
Beijing remains an unhealed wound for some, but others say that the
square is too commonly used for ceremonies and recreation for one
more president's visit to matter.
</P>
<P>
   Su Pei, a university student out shopping this sunny afternoon,
said of the unresolved issues of 1989: ``This is a Chinese affair,
while Clinton coming to China is an international affair. Whether
he goes to the square just doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, the parents of one student who was killed at
Tiananmen criticized Clinton for agreeing to be welcomed there. In
a letter to journalists and American officials, Ding Zilin, a
professor who has been an outspoken government critic since 1989
and her husband, Jiang Peikun, said that to hold a ceremony there
``greatly hurts the feelings of freedom-seeking Chinese people and
especially the feelings of relatives of the June 4 dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with European journalists made public Monday,
the American ambassador to China, James Sasser, said he had no
indication that China would release more dissidents. But he said
that in view of ``glacial'' but real improvements in human rights,
he hoped that American economic sanctions imposed after the 1989
crackdown might soon be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing Monday, checks of movie theaters found that few
people had yet paid the $1.80 needed to see the new documentary.
However, theater workers said they expected that school and worker
groups would come soon, possibly with free tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The film's prospects may be undermined by the television
premiere, this Friday, of a similar homage titled, ``A Handshake
Goes Beyond the Century _ President Jiang Zemin's Visit to the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week in the official press, along with announcements about
the movie, came praise for Jiang that was unusually fulsome by the
recent standards of ``collective leadership with Jiang Zemin at the
core,'' as the party leaders refer to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang ``possesses a wide knowledge of things ancient and modern,
speaks fluent English, plays the guitar, sings Beijing opera and is
good at swimming and dancing,'' the China Youth Daily said. ``And
he is amiable and worthy of respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Another paper, calling Jiang ``extraordinarily quick-witted and
charismatic,'' said he had ``conquered the hearts of Americans.''

GOLD BREAKS ITS PROMISE TO MINERS OF LESOTHO 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MASERU, Lesotho _ The other men call David Monkhe the Priest.
Wearing a tattered overcoat and a hat pulled low, he walks back and
forth along the lines of the jobless gathered outside the mine
hiring hall in the raw mists of a winter dawn, blowing a reedy
flute and summoning them to prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pray for jobs,'' one job seeker said, ``and for hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Monkhe says he is a laid-off miner, hoping against hope to be
rehired.
</P>
<P>
   To the people of this tiny mountain kingdom, the country that
surrounds them, South Africa, is the shaft of gold at the end of a
once-shimmering rainbow that is now fast fading away. Of all the
places in southern Africa hurt by the layoffs caused by the sinking
price of gold, Lesotho is probably the worst hit.
</P>
<P>
   The damage is felt in many ways, the shrinking of the national
income, an increase in divorces and rapes in small villages used to
their men being far away.
</P>
<P>
   The number of gold miners in South Africa has fallen, from
500,000 in the mid-1980s to 300,000, and pessimists expect the
total to hit 250,000 this year. Of those perhaps 80,000 will be
from Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, nearly 170,000 men from the hardscrabble villages
worked in the mines. The money that they sent back represented 40
percent of the gross national product.
</P>
<P>
   Layoffs have accelerated with the fall in the price of gold.
After hovering just below $400 an ounce for much of the 90s, it
sank as low as $280 in January and has risen slightly since. South
Africa's deep hot mines have the world's highest production costs,
and by some estimates 5 of the 30 odd mines can turn a profit at
$300 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:45 a.m. one day David Baholo Ntlhakana, chief recruitment
officer for this branch of the Employment Bureau of Africa, stepped
into the middle of the 300 men and opened his big red ledger.
Unbidden, the men formed ranks, and their chatter died. Wrapped in
bright blankets, the national costume of Lesotho, they resembled
shivering bolts of cloth. His words carried clearly in the cold
air. The message was simple: Go home. There's nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst, the worst,'' Ntlhakana said. ``They must
travel a long way home or look for temporary jobs in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Julius Rakoena, 40, worked the mines for 19 years before being
laid off last year. ``The boss said the job is finished because
gold is low,'' he said. Asked how his family stays alive, Rakoena
said quietly: ``It is difficult. Other people next door give them
food.''
</P>
<P>
   Bereng Khutlane, 51, started work in 1969 and was laid off this
year. ``It causes difficulties at home,'' he acknowledged. ``My
wife wants me to go back.'' His youngest child _ he doesn't
remember her age, but indicates her height with his hand _ dropped
out of school.
</P>
<P>
   In February the mines formed a crisis committee with the
National Union of Mineworkers to try to slow the layoffs and
forestall labor unrest. As layoffs nonetheless continued, the union
asserted that the committee was a rubber stamp and threatened to
quit. But the mining companies say they are at the mercy of faraway
bad news and good economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   Central banks from Australia to Belgium have been selling off
gold reserves. The crisis in Asia dried up jewelry demand, and
strict inflation control in the United States and Europe made the
metal less attractive. Adjusting for inflation, the $280 January
low was the same price that gold fetched in 1982, about $80.
</P>
<P>
   As the president of the Chamber of Mines, Bobby Godsell, pointed
out: ``If you were to open a shop and had to sell your goods at
1982 prices, you would find it very difficult to stay in business.
The mines are finding it very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of South African mining companies say they adjusted far
too slowly. Too little, for example, has been done to foster a
local jewelry industry. The necklaces sold here are made in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the industry long clung to its old ways. The stereotype of
a mine gang used to be a white ``miner,'' the possessor of a
blasting certificate, sending orders to his low-paid black crew and
beating the slackers if he missed his quota. The anger that system
fostered meant high absenteeism, vandalism and fires _ and a
militant union, which led a crippling strike in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed. At Durban Roodepoort Deep, a worn-out
103-year-old mine that is barely able to stay open, nearly 95
percent of the miners are black, and some crews work on the bonus
system, paid by the ton of rock moved. They are twice as productive
as other crews, a manager, Frik Coetzee, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mines are working smarter,'' said Leon Esterhuizen, a
gold-industry analyst for the ABN-Amro investment bank. ``If you
cut a typical 15-strong crew to 10 men, they'll do the same job if
you give more incentive like a 50 percent pay rise.''
</P>
<P>
   But to keep peace with labor and the new government, the mines
have all but stopped hiring from Lesotho or Mozambique, as they
used to. ``Novices don't get jobs here,'' said Puseletso Salae, a
union official in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically that occurs although the mines love foreign
employees. ``Workers from Lesotho work 10 times harder than
others,'' a former mine engineer said. ``Why? Because there's
nothing for them back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home, erosion and overcrowding on soil that was already
thin and stony have left little to plow. Villages that used to send
platoons to the mines are now watching them hoe small gardens or
herd sheep, jobs traditionally left to boys.
</P>
<P>
   In Pshatlella, a village southeast of Maseru, idle young men
hang around the roadside liquor store. For a small fee they will
take visitors to fathers and uncles laid off from the mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are starving, Sir, we are starving,'' said a rail-thin
William Sechaba Makamase, 50, a winch driver from 1973 to 1992.
Outside his solid house with its swept-dirt yard, built in those
good times, he survives on a small garden and three cows. Cattle
theft has worsened. ``Just down the road,'' he said, ``someone
stole a cow and slaughtered it to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Emily, has stayed with him, he said, but that is not
often. ``The women leave,'' Makamase said. ``They cannot stay with
a man who is bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Makamase, 44, nodded assent and said they get by selling
some corn. Some women brew sorghum beer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Villages can be torn apart by the aftershocks of layoffs, said
Lisemelo Mosakeng, administrator of a trade school for miners'
families. A man laid off after years in a union mine may receive
several thousand dollars in severance pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hear your husband is leaving the mine,'' said Miss
Mosakeng, 25, speaking in the role of a village hussy, ``I might go
to him in South Africa, and we will enjoy his retrenchment package.
Then when he comes back your children will have nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Laid-off miners often drink their pay, she said, and are left
without even the $2 bus fare to the hiring halls. ``They remain in
the village, where there are lots of young girls,'' she said. ``So
the rape problem is very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply having men around disrupts tradition. Unlike women in
much of Africa, Lesotho wives are used to making family decisions,
Salae said. Having unemployed husbands in the house to second-guess
them leads to fights and divorce.
</P>
<P>
   At the hiring hall, just before Ntlhakana dispersed the men, he
read a couple of names. One of those, Sello James Ramarake, 22,
spoke up. He had not been waiting for days. Although he is a
novice, he came, in his new Planet Hollywood jacket, confident of
being called. His father had just died of tuberculosis in the St.
Helena Mine's hospital, and it is industry custom to hire the son
of a man who dies on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother will be very happy,'' he said. ``There are 10 of us.
I will be the breadwinner.''

PROPOSAL SEEKS TO RAISE REQUIREMENTS FOR TEACHERS TO RETAIN STATE
LICENSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After deliberating for more than two years on how to
raise the bar for public-school teachers in New York, state
education officials have settled on a proposal that cracks down on
college teaching programs and requires all new teachers to enroll
in college courses or professional development seminars every five
years in order to retain their state teaching licenses.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the board of regents, which sets state education
policy, the proposal would effectively abolish the lifetime
licenses that the state's 202,000 teachers now hold. Few states
still maintain permanent teaching certificates.
</P>
<P>
   Unveiled Monday by the regents task force on teaching, the
proposal calls for teachers to take, though not necessarily pass,
175 hours of continuing education every five years. The requirement
would apply to teachers who earn a state license beginning in
September 2000, but it would not affect those who are licensed now.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also ups the ante for teacher education programs at
colleges and universities around the state. Under this measure,
which would go into effect in 1999, the state would decertify
programs at which fewer than 80 percent of students pass the three
tests required for licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 25 of the states' 113 teacher education programs fell
below that mark on the liberal arts test, 8 of them colleges of the
City University of New York. For instance, at Medgar Evers College,
41 percent passed that test in 1996-1997, and 52 percent passed at
York College; but 88 percent passed at Queens College, 83 percent
at Staten Island and 78 percent at Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Mirrer, the vice chancellor for academic affairs at CUNY,
said Monday that scores have been improving at all of the programs,
and expressed confidence that each campus would meet the 80 percent
threshold by next year.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-member board of regents is scheduled to vote in mid-July
on the proposal, which needs a majority for approval. The plan
already has the support of the eight board members on the task
force. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, must then
draft regulations on each of the task force's points, including how
much time a school would be allowed to bring up student scores
before losing its certification. The task force had earlier
proposed a slightly higher bar for the colleges: an 85 percent
threshold.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher review proposal, though, is stiffer than one the
task force had been considering. In November, in a draft report,
the committee recommended that teachers undergo a performance
review every five years or face dismissal; but the process for
dismissal is long and complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Under the latest proposal, the state could simply revoke a
teacher's license if he or she did not undergo the required 175
hours of continuing education.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every way, I think this is a tougher set of requirements,''
Mills said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers' union officials in New York City described the latest
recommendation as stricter ``in some ways'' but also ``a more
balanced approach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It recognizes that it is professional development that is the
key, instead of a punitive approach and a testing approach,'' said
Susan Amlung, a spokeswoman for the United Federation of Teachers.
``Professional development is a much more constructive way of
achieving and maintaining teacher quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials in New York City said they hoped the state would
require districts to provide the seminars, rather than place the
burden on teachers. ``It's a very stiff requirement _ 175 hours is
a lot,'' Ms. Amlung said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, J.D. LaRock, a spokesman for the schools chancellor, Dr.
Rudy Crew, praised the state proposal but expressed concern for the
potential costs of the professional development requirement.
``Insofar as these recommendations will mean extra cost for us, we
will look to the state for help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the professional development requirement would apply
only to new teachers, state education officials say that, if
approved, it would have far-reaching effects in a few years. About
half the state's teaching force is expected to retire in the next
decade, according to a state education department spokesman, Alan
Ray. New York City alone anticipates hiring 30,000 teachers over
the next four years, LaRock said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also recommends setting up some criteria by which
teachers are reviewed every year by officials in their district.
Teachers who are found to be deficient would have to abide by ``an
improvement plan'' to be developed by locals officials, according
to the proposal. Now, all teachers are to be evaluated yearly, but
there are no state-mandated guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The task force also wants teachers to have a master's degree or
to get one within two years of entering the classroom; they now
have five years to get a master's.
</P>
<P>
   To attract teachers, the Regents will ask Gov. George E. Pataki
and the legislature to enact legislation offering scholarships to
undergraduate and graduate students in exchange for a promise to
teach in needy schools, as well as a $10,000 bonus for certified
teachers who agree to teach for three years in such schools.

   DAYTON, Ohio _ A tornado caused minor damage near Greenville,
Ohio and another funnel cloud touched down briefly near Miamisburg,
Ohio during Monday's rush hour as heavy thunderstorms pounded the
area.
</P>
<P>
   The brief but intense storms hit hardest in Darke County, Ohio.
Winds picked up a 300-pound pickup truck camper and smashed it in
two against Dave Ranly's house three miles north of Greenville. The
winds, estimated at 75 mph, carried away another camper top. It
couldn't be located, Ranly said.
</P>
<P>
   Ranly said he briefly saw a funnel cloud as it passed overhead
before he retreated into his basement with his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up and said, `Oh, s---,' '' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hemmerich of Darke County's Emergency Management Agency,
said the damage was caused by straight-line winds from a tornado
that didn't touch down. ``The wind underneath it can do a lot of
damage as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service also confirmed a tornado touchdown
a quarter-mile north of Ohio 725 in Miamisburg. No damage was
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The storm downed power lines in Montgomery, Preble, Greene and
Darke counties in Ohio. Dayton Power and Light Co. said 700
customers in Dayton, Miamisburg, Centerville, Ohio, Beavercreek,
Ohio and Xenia, Ohio lost power for several hours, with most
restored by 9 p.m., said spokesman Mike Novosad.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service said Monday evening that 0.74
inches of rain fell at Dayton International Airport from midnight
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Valley got an especially large dose of rain for a June
weekend. With June only half over, rainfall is already 2.1 inches
above average for the month, according to the National Weather
Service. Through 7 P.M. Monday, it recorded 4.67 inches of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Commuters to Dayton's southern suburbs had to navigate suddenly
flooded streets in Moraine, Kettering and West Carrollton, all in
Ohio. Kettering police fielded reports of flooding throughout the
city. Rushing waters lifted sewer lids.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy weather followed a weekend of unusually heavy rainfall
and damaging winds.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Valley Conservancy District recorded the heaviest
rainfall from Thursday morning to Friday morning. In that period
Sidney recorded 4.09 inches, Lockington Dam recorded 3.74 inches
and Versailles recorded 2.85 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Beeman, a hydrologist with the district, said Monday the
Great Miami River in downtown Dayton is 3 feet above normal for
this time of year but well below flood stage.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Clayton, Ohio spent the weekend cleaning up after
high winds swept through the area Friday, toppling trees throughout
the area, including many more than 50 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like bulldozers went through _ or a bomb,'' said
Delaine Niesley.
</P>
<P>
   Niesley spent Monday telephoning lumber companies hoping to
recoup the thousands of dollars in estimated clean-up costs for
eight large trees ripped out of the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Niesley suspects a tornado touched down, but that couldn't be
confirmed Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Today, expect showers and thunderstorms throughout the day.

 &HT;    Tornado blamed for minor damage in Ohio

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A tornado caused minor damage near Greenville,
Ohio and another funnel cloud touched down briefly near Miamisburg,
Ohio during Monday's rush hour as heavy thunderstorms pounded the
area.
</P>
<P>
   The brief but intense storms hit hardest in Darke County, Ohio.
Winds picked up a 300-pound pickup truck camper and smashed it in
two against Dave Ranly's house three miles north of Greenville. The
winds, estimated at 75 mph, carried away another camper top. It
couldn't be located, Ranly said.
</P>
<P>
   Ranly said he briefly saw a funnel cloud as it passed overhead
before he retreated into his basement with his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up and said, `Oh, s---,' '' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hemmerich of Darke County's Emergency Management Agency,
said the damage was caused by straight-line winds from a tornado
that didn't touch down. ``The wind underneath it can do a lot of
damage as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service also confirmed a tornado touchdown
a quarter-mile north of Ohio 725 in Miamisburg. No damage was
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The storm downed power lines in Montgomery, Preble, Greene and
Darke counties in Ohio. Dayton Power and Light Co. said 700
customers in Dayton, Miamisburg, Centerville, Ohio, Beavercreek,
Ohio and Xenia, Ohio lost power for several hours, with most
restored by 9 p.m., said spokesman Mike Novosad.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service said Monday evening that 0.74
inches of rain fell at Dayton International Airport from midnight
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Valley got an especially large dose of rain for a June
weekend. With June only half over, rainfall is already 2.1 inches
above average for the month, according to the National Weather
Service. Through 7 P.M. Monday, it recorded 4.67 inches of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Commuters to Dayton's southern suburbs had to navigate suddenly
flooded streets in Moraine, Kettering and West Carrollton, all in
Ohio. Kettering police fielded reports of flooding throughout the
city. Rushing waters lifted sewer lids.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy weather followed a weekend of unusually heavy rainfall
and damaging winds.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Valley Conservancy District recorded the heaviest
rainfall from Thursday morning to Friday morning. In that period
Sidney recorded 4.09 inches, Lockington Dam recorded 3.74 inches
and Versailles recorded 2.85 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Beeman, a hydrologist with the district, said Monday the
Great Miami River in downtown Dayton is 3 feet above normal for
this time of year but well below flood stage.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Clayton, Ohio spent the weekend cleaning up after
high winds swept through the area Friday, toppling trees throughout
the area, including many more than 50 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like bulldozers went through _ or a bomb,'' said
Delaine Niesley.
</P>
<P>
   Niesley spent Monday telephoning lumber companies hoping to
recoup the thousands of dollars in estimated clean-up costs for
eight large trees ripped out of the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Niesley suspects a tornado touched down, but that couldn't be
confirmed Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Today, expect showers and thunderstorms throughout the day.

EDITORIAL: SPEEDIER INSPECTIONS IN IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The following editorial will appear in The New York Times, on
Tuesday, June 16:
</P>
<P>
   It was startling to hear Richard Butler, the chief U.N. weapons
inspector for Iraq, declare Monday that a more cooperative attitude
in Baghdad may now make it possible to conclude the search for
concealed biological and chemical weapons and prohibited missiles
in just a few more months. Butler is not known for optimistic
forecasts about Iraqi behavior, and Baghdad seldom cooperates for
very long.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's lack of cooperation has prolonged the arms inspections,
originally expected to be completed in six months, into what is now
their eighth year. That in turn has prolonged the economic
sanctions burdening Iraq's people. Baghdad has all along had the
power to wind up the inspections by fulfilling its obligations to
turn over records of its prohibited weapons programs to United
Nations investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq must reveal what has happened to the anthrax and botulinum
toxin it is known to have imported before the Persian Gulf war and
may since have multiplied. It must also account for the deadly VX
nerve gas it is known to have manufactured and the medium-range
missiles it has tried to build secretly from imported designs. U.N.
experts believe that documentation for these programs may be stored
on computers in buildings that weapons inspectors have been barred
from in the past.
</P>
<P>
   This documentation must be handed over, any illegal weapons must
be destroyed and a long-term monitoring system put in place to
detect future production of biological, chemical or nuclear
weapons. Only then should the security council consider a timetable
for lifting sanctions.

RESTAURATEUR SUES PARTNER OVER PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MARIAN BURROS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The breakup of one of the most unlikely partnerships
in the culinary world has led to a lawsuit in which one well-known
partner has accused the other of misappropriating money.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff, Warner LeRoy, the owner of Tavern on the Green,
has accused David Bouley, one of the city's most respected chefs
and restaurateurs, of cheating him out of his share of income and
profits at Bouley Bakery, the restaurant on Duane Street, which the
two men own in a partnership that is to eventually include other
restaurants, a culinary school and a shop in TriBeCa.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed last Thursday, came six months after Bouley had
started negotiations to buy out LeRoy's share of the partnership.
Bouley said he had offered LeRoy $4.15 million to buy out his $2.05
million share of the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were close to a number, just a few hundred
thousand off,'' Bouley said, ``but then I was served with the
suit.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks to have Bouley Bakery placed in a receivership
that would manage the business until LeRoy receives an accounting
of the bakery's income. It also seeks punitive damages and legal
fees.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Goldstein, a lawyer for Bouley, called the accusations
of misappropriation ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. LeRoy has his own bookkeeper at the bakery,'' Goldstein
said. ``The only thing I can think of is that he is doing this to
strengthen his position in the buyout.''
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokeswoman, LeRoy said he would have no comment. &QL;

DUNLAP IS DISMISSED BY SUNBEAM BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Contains additional information in bottom half of article)  
(lh) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years, Albert J. Dunlap has been one of the
nation's most feared corporate executives. He downsized with a
vengeance, frequently boasting of the thousands he had thrown out
of work to lift a company's stock price, earning himself the
nickname Chain Saw Al.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is Dunlap who has been thrown out of a job. Over the
weekend, the self-proclaimed turnaround artist, who had run Sunbeam
Corp. for almost two years, was dismissed in a revolt by the board
_ led by some of his hand-picked directors.
</P>
<P>
   Saying it no longer believed Dunlap had the skills to revive the
ailing consumer appliance maker, the board announced Monday that
Sunbeam's financial results for the rest of the year would be far
worse than expected and that it needed a new boss.
</P>
<P>
   It was a big comedown. Dunlap, who wrote in his best-selling
autobiography, ``Mean Business,'' that the best bargain was an
expensive chief executive, became known for his wholesale sacking
of factory workers and managers alike, both at Sunbeam and
elsewhere. He was tirelessly self-promotional, popping up
repeatedly on television for the last two years plugging his book
and _ calling himself ``Rambo in pinstripes'' _ preaching his
slash-and-burn philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap often passed out autographed copies of the book to
Sunbeam employees, bankers, even waiters and doormen _ anyone who
would take them. As he did so, though, Sunbeam was hurting. ``The
outside directors have unanimously taken this decisive action
because we have lost confidence in Dunlap's leadership,'' said one
director, Peter A. Langerman, chief operating officer of Franklin
Mutual Advisors Inc., Sunbeam's largest shareholder, who will
replace him as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But his dismissal is not likely to be a clean end to his
dealings with Sunbeam. On paper, Dunlap is owed a severance package
of salary, stock and options that could be worth more than $35
million. But the board has other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   An executive close to the board said he did not deserve it.
``The board's view is they feel badly used by Dunlap,'' he said,
adding that board members felt blind-sided by poor financial
results recently. ``They are furious, and they don't want to pay
him severance, and don't believe he was straight with them on the
erosion of the numbers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the board is successful in denying him the money, Dunlap
would be one of the few chief executives to fail at the job and not
walk away with millions anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``When companies kill the king, they at least give him a decent
burial,'' said Graef S. Crystal, a watchdog of executive pay. ``I
think they're going to have to pay him the whole thing. They don't
have any choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap could not be reached for comment, and his lawyer did not
return calls.

 NEW YORK: return calls.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dunlap _ who has dismissed more than 15,000 workers at Sunbeam
and Scott Paper, which he ran before coming to Sunbeam _ has said
that 80 percent of American businesses need to be ``Dunlapped,''
i.e., subject to huge overhauls that ``eliminate what is not the
best.'' But at Sunbeam, he got into trouble by promising more than
he could deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Just months ago, board members and major shareholders were still
voicing support for the 60-year-old West Point-trained former
paratrooper. The stock rose nearly 50 percent on the day in July
1996 that he arrived at Sunbeam, and climbed to a high of $53 in
March after Dunlap proclaimed Sunbeam fixed and said it was ready
to grow with the purchases of the makers of Mr. Coffee machines,
First Alert smoke alarms and Coleman outdoor equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But while Wall Street cheered, some investors and competitors
were scratching their heads, as Dunlap repeatedly promised 20
percent annual sales and profit gains in an industry that was
growing by only about 3 percent a year. For a time, he seemed to be
pulling it off. Then, in March, came regulatory filings that
detailed how Sunbeam sold $58 million worth of barbecue grills in
December and gave retailers until this month to pay for them. This
helped Sunbeam post an unsustainable 18 percent surge in sales last
year. This was the last straw after a series of sales shortfalls
and earnings disappointments over the last several quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The grill deal essentially allowed Sunbeam to borrow sales from
future quarters. And on May 11, it reported a 4 percent sales drop
and a $44.6 million loss, blaming the grill promotion and even El
Nino for the poor results. In April, shareholders filed lawsuits
against the company and Dunlap, contending that the grill promotion
was devised to prop up sales numbers. The company and Dunlap have
denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the stock continued to slide. It closed at $15.75 a
share, down $2.3125, or 13 percent. Monday's closing price
represented a 52-week low for the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month Sunbeam said the problems would linger into
the current quarter. On Monday, the board said sales had been so
bad this quarter that the company would report an operating loss
for the period and would not meet its goal of earning $1 a share
for the full year, even though that amount had been revised
downward several times to account for Sunbeam's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers weren't happening, and the explanation of why it
happened didn't really wash,'' said Charles M. Elson, a
Dunlap-appointed director who made the motion to dismiss him.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel last Tuesday, the
board asked Dunlap to explain the recent poor performance. ``He
said it was a transition year and don't expect a lot,'' Elson said.
That statement apparently sealed Dunlap's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said at a press conference two weeks earlier that we would
earn 5 cents to 10 cents a share'' for the second quarter, Elson
said. ``If you are going to assure people of results, you've got to
meet the result, and when it became clear to us he wasn't going to
be making the results, that called into question his ability to
execute the long-term strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since shortly after he arrived, Dunlap has faced criticism that
he shipped too many goods to stores, simply to make the numbers
look better, a claim he angrily denied. But in a conference call
with analysts Monday, board members confirmed that part of
Sunbeam's problem stemmed from having ``pushed to make aggressive
sales objectives over the past several months,'' leaving retailers
overstocked with Sunbeam grills and electric blankets and Oster
blenders.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the company must clean up the mess Dunlap left, a charge
that goes to Jerry W. Levin, a turnaround specialist who represents
Ronald O. Perelman, whose MacAndrews &AMP; Forbes Holdings is Sunbeam's
second-largest shareholder. Perelman also controls Revlon Inc. and
controlled the Coleman company, which Sunbeam recently acquired.
Levin, a former chairman and chief executive of Revlon and Coleman,
will become Sunbeam's chief.
</P>
<P>
   One of Dunlap's earliest missteps may have been purchasing
Coleman, apparently miscalculating what buying it from Perelman in
exchange for stock would do to the control of Sunbeam. Because now,
just three months later, Sunbeam is in the hands of Perelman's
point man, and Dunlap is out.
</P>
<P>
   Four board members _ Elson, Howard G. Kristol, William T. Rutter
and Faith Whittlesey _ are Dunlap appointees. They will remain on
the board, but Russell A. Kersh, a longtime Dunlap aide who is
Sunbeam's vice chairman and chief financial officer, is expected to
be dismissed, according to an executive close to the board.
</P>
<P>
   The company said its three operating officers would continue to
run the company and report to Levin.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, which he promoted as aggressively as Sunbeam
promotes its toasters, Dunlap wrote: ``My pay should be compared to
superstars in other fields, not to the average CEO. Only a handful
of chief executives are worth the big bucks they are paid. Many are
grossly overpaid and should be fired and then replaced by CEOs
whose pay is strictly performance-based.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sunbeam board apparently agreed.

LUCIO COSTA, 96, PLANNER OF FUTURISTIC BRASILIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Lucio Costa, the architect and urban
planner whose vision of man living in harmony with his tropical
surroundings carried Brazilian architecture into the modern age,
died on Saturday at his home here. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, Costa was best known as the planner of
Brasilia, the ambitious, futuristic Brazilian capital that surged
up from the arid savanna in the state of Goias under President
Juscelino Kubitschek in the 1950s. Though Costa detested the
comparison once made by an American writer, the plan of Brasilia
did resemble an airplane, with wings and other axes. At the cockpit
stood the Plaza of the Three Powers, and along the body of the
plane, sectors for monuments, cultural centers and a chapel.
</P>
<P>
   He placed apartments and homes in peaceful green spaces largely
free of traffic. Shunning the names of colonial viceroys, counts
and generals that marked the streets of the old capital in Rio de
Janeiro, Costa simply numbered blocks and neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time of optimism and audacity, recalled Oscar Niemeyer,
who designed Brasilia's buildings. ``We had to rush to get
everything done so the president could inaugurate it before the end
of his term,'' said Niemeyer, who started his career working under
Costa.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, Costa became known in the early 1930s, when Getulio
Vargas appointed him head of the National School of Fine Arts. He
organized an art show that featured a new generation of artists who
would become major figures in Brazilian modern art, including
Candido Portinari, Cicero Dias and Ismael Nery.
</P>
<P>
   Costa won the commission to design the Brazil Pavilion at the
New York World's Fair in 1939, and invited Niemeyer to join him.
The result, a two-story building with glass walls looking out on a
pond of waterlilies, bore the trademark simplicity and serenity
that would mark Costa's later works.
</P>
<P>
   ``His biggest contribution was seeking a balance between the
modern problems of technology that becomes outdated every day and
human values of an earlier age,'' said Julio Roberto Katinsky,
director of the the school of architecture and city Planning at the
University of Sao Paulo. ``He tried to establish a connection
between a world that's in permanent transition and enduring human
values.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Costa was called upon to plan an emerging suburb
of Rio, the Barra da Tijuca. But unlike Brasilia, the land in Barra
was already privately owned and a master plan proved largely
impossible to implement. The suburb is now a chilly seaside mass of
apartment towers dotted with shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   While Brasilia was initially hailed for its futuristic vision
and scale, it later came under stinging criticism as a city without
soul whose wide avenues were dangerous for pedestrians. Costa felt
impelled to defend his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't bother visiting Brasilia if you've already formed an
opinion and have preconceived ideas,'' he once wrote. ``Stay where
you are. Let them say what they want, Brasilia is a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Costa gradually withdrew from social life after 1956, when his
wife, Julieta, died in a car accident after Costa fell asleep while
driving. In recent years, the architect suffered from glaucoma and
cataracts and was gradually losing his vision, said his daughter,
Maria Elisa Costa.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, she helped him gather the books, letters and
sketches that cluttered his room into a tome on his life and work.
``When we realized how much material there was,'' Ms. Costa
recalled, ``I suggested breaking it into two volumes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm only one person,'' she remembered her father
answering.
</P>
<P>
   As well as Ms. Costa, Costa is survived by another daughter,
Helena; three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   More than a scholarly treatise, his book ``Lucio Costa: Record
of a Way of Life'' (1995) is the album of an erudite man living a
balanced life. Mixed with his sketches for the country's new
capital and explanations of its logic are photos of one of his
grandchildren, Julieta, and her childhood paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The book also includes an open letter he wrote to Americans in
1961, when he believed the United States was feeling daunted by the
Soviet challenge. ``Americans, you belong to the New Era. Look
forward _ that is your tradition,'' he urged.
</P>
<P>
   But the book is also the album of a man who had ridden the crest
and had been thrown on the shore, forgotten there, to watch others
rise. On the inside flap of his book is a quote: ``When all else
changes for you, nature remains the same, and the same sun rises on
your days.''

A UNIQUE WALL STREET FIRM JOINS THE CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editorial Observer)  
 (af)  
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The following editorial will appear in The New York Times, on
Tuesday, June 16:
</P>
<P>
   Hire the best, and pay them less.
</P>
<P>
   That has been part of the secret of Goldman, Sachs, the premier
firm on Wall Street and the only one not owned by public
shareholders, either directly or as part of a larger company. There
are other strong firms and there are areas of the business where
Goldman is not the best. But over all, it has an image others can
only envy, as was shown in the most recent banking mega-merger.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, each side in merger negotiations is represented by an
investment banker whose job is to help its client get the best deal
possible and avoid a merger that will not work out. But Norwest and
Wells Fargo each insisted on being represented by Goldman, whatever
the potential conflicts. So Goldman assigned separate teams, and
will collect big fees from each side.
</P>
<P>
   Although Goldman has a reputation of paying less than some
lesser firms, every new investment banker has dreamt of grabbing
Wall Street's most coveted brass ring: a Goldman partnership. Win
that, and a person is set for life, both in money and prestige.
Even the losers did not suffer too badly; people who left Goldman,
often after concluding they would not make partner, have been
sought after by many firms.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the fact that the partners could get away with paying
a bit less than the competition for talent in a business where
talent is of supreme importance also helped to raise Goldman's
profits. That made the lure of a partnership even greater, for it
is the partners who share in those profits. And because the
partners must leave most of the money at work in the partnership,
they have the greatest part of their wealth tied up in the future
performance of the firm _ a clear incentive to avoid the
bet-the-store risks that have severely damaged some other firms.
</P>
<P>
   But now Goldman is walking away from that structure. At a
meeting over the weekend in Palisades, N.Y., the partners agreed to
convert their partnership to a corporation and sell stock to the
public, probably sometime this fall. Then you too can own a part of
Goldman, even if you never came close to Harvard Business School
and have no idea whether or not the term ``net present value''
refers to the cost of Christmas gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Goldman doing this? For the money, of course. The capital
it could raise from the public will come in handy to expand
Goldman's investments, and its stock can be used for acquisitions,
which some see as a necessity when many Wall Street firms are part
of bigger operations.
</P>
<P>
   So the partners, already rich, will become a lot richer.
Currently, when they gradually cash out after retirement, they get
paid based on Goldman's book value _ the value of its assets less
its liabilities. But that figure gives no weight to Goldman's
reputation, or to the current bull market. When Goldman goes
public, its stock is expected to sell for at least three times its
book value. The average partner is expected to have stock worth
more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to resist such a windfall, particularly since it may
not be available forever. Goldman partners know that within two
years of Morgan Stanley's going public in 1986, at about 2.7 times
book value, its shares fell to below book value. That was a result
of the 1987 crash, which made investors fear _ wrongly, as it
turned out _ that Wall Street's good times were over.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman traditionally names new partners every other year, with
the next, and probably final, class expected to be anointed this
fall. One of them may be Abby Joseph Cohen, Goldman's highly
respected market guru and one of the few strategists who has been
consistently bullish, and therefore right, since 1991. Then the
partners, including the new ones, will be able to cash in if they
wish to do so by selling shares and taking profits that might
vanish if this bull market ever does.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman will no doubt remain a fearsome competitor with a great
attraction to prospective employees. But it will no longer be
unique. And management may find that it is harder to attract and
retain top talent without paying more for it, either in cash or in
stock options. By going public, Goldman may have diminished the
very pre-eminence that makes it so attractive.

   (NYT11) NEW YORK -- June 15, 1998 -- SOTHEBY-HAWKES-PROFILE,
6-15 -- Dana Hawkes, a Sotheby's vice president, with rock 'n' roll
collectibles. Raised in Boston, Ms. Hawkes majored in art history
at Swarthmore. She went to work for Sotheby's in 1984, when
collectibles brought in $800,000 annually to the New York house.
Now, Ms. Hawkes says, the field brings in $6 million to $8 million
a year. She credits the increase to nostalgic baby boomers who have
reached the age of disposable income. (Librado Romero/New York

BEAR-BRYANT-MUSEUM-2, 6-15 -- Jula Norris, from left, Mary Cleland
and Bonnie Williams drove from Montgomery, Ala., to visit Bear
Bryant museum in Tuscaloosa. This exhibit includes the famous
houndstooth hat worn by coach Bryant. Bryant won three national
championships in the 1960s - and six in all - and made the name
``Alabama'' stand for something good. Alabama was synonymous with
George Wallace - and racism - then. (Neil Brake/The Tuscaloosa News

BEAR-BRYANT-MUSEUM-1, 6-15 -- The bronze bust of Paul William
``Bear'' Bryant that glares from the museum's entrance is about
five times life-size, and still might not be quite big enough. The
faithful - old women, teen-agers and grown men who see him as
something more than mortal - file past the Bear Bryant museum's
long-flat footballs, frayed jerseys and ancient cleats, just
remembering. (Neil Brake/The Tuscaloosa News Photo) *LITE

Bryant museum in Tuscaloosa. This exhibit includes the famous
houndstooth hat worn by coach Bryant. Bryant won three national
championships in the 1960s - and six in all - and made the name
``Alabama'' stand for something good. Alabama was synonymous with
George Wallace - and racism - then. (Neil Brake/The Tuscaloosa News

long-flat footballs, frayed jerseys and ancient cleats, just
remembering. (Neil Brake/The Tuscaloosa News Photo) *LITE

FLEXIBILITY AND PLANNING ARE STRESSED IN CHICAGO 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Sidebar with NY-WORKFARE.) 
(th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In a small, windowless room in a welfare center on the
South Side here, Elizabeth Matos is deciding what to do in the next
month to progress from welfare to work.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Matos, 35, who has two children, wants to work with young
children, and so she has been volunteering 25 hours a week as an
aide at a preschool. Under an experimental program called Pathways,
the volunteer work satisfies state rules on work participation,
allowing her to keep her welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the starting point for an extremely flexible program
intended to get her a job.
</P>
<P>
   Seated around a table with three other welfare recipients, Miss
Matos says she would like to build on her volunteer work by
enrolling at a community college. If she earned an associate's
degree, she says, she could become a preschool teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Toby Herr, the director of Pathways, explains patiently that
Miss Matos cannot go to college full time for two years and remain
on welfare, under the rules in Illinois. But Ms. Herr says Miss
Matos may qualify as a preschool aide if she takes two short
courses on child development.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herr makes a few quick calls and learns that Miss Matos can
register for the first course in two weeks. She can take the second
course in the fall, after which she should be able to be hired as
an aide. Then, while she works, Miss Matos could pursue a community
college degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that OK?'' Ms. Herr says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's great,'' Miss Matos responds, with a wide smile.
</P>
<P>
   In 15 minutes, the women developed a personalized plan for Miss
Matos. Each participant attends a monthly meeting, reporting to job
counselors on what he or she did the previous month and working up
a plan for the next month. The plans are written into formal,
color-coded paper diaries, which must be signed by the appropriate
authorities and handed in each month.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herr created Pathways three years ago as an adaptation of a
nonprofit welfare-to-work program called Project Match, which she
founded in 1985 in the Cabrini-Green housing complex. The programs
view the route from welfare to work as a broad continuum, one that
does not stop when someone gets a job. Ms. Herr said research shows
that most people leaving welfare work at two to five jobs before
their lives stabilize, if they do at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an event, but a process,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pathways was designed to be used in traditional government
welfare centers, while still employing the core ideas of Project
Match: individual planning and maximum flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   For a welfare recipient with a history of working, the monthly
plan might involve daily attendance at a job-search center in
downtown Chicago. For someone with limited or no work experience, a
plan might start with volunteering at her child's school. The goal
is to understand who people are and how to move them along in
positive experiences, all the way to a job.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few dozen people are enrolled in the Pathways program at
any time. Of the 33 who began the program in 1995, 14 were employed
at the end of the first year. More than 800 people have
participated in Ms. Herr's original program, Project Match, since
1985; research of a sample group showed that 54 percent were
working year-round in the fifth year after they had entered the
program, according to a paper published by Ms. Herr. &QL;

EDITORIAL: MICHAEL'S LAST HURRAH? 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The following editorial will appear in The New York Times on
Tuesday, June 16:
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls won their sixth basketball championship in
eight years Sunday night, and once again the hard part was finding
a story line that did not begin and end with Michael Jordan. There
was Scottie Pippen, who basically quit during a couple of important
games in years past but who this time played heroically despite
injury. There was Karl Malone, a stubborn old warrior who almost
carried the Utah Jazz to a seventh game by himself. There were the
referees, whose odd calls near the end seemed to tilt in Jordan's
favor. There was, finally, the dynastic question _ whether this was
truly the end of the Bulls' great run of championships, or whether
Jerry Reinsdorf, the team's owner, will cough up the $80 million
necessary to keep Michael, Scottie and Phil Jackson, the coach,
together.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these were mere subplots in the larger drama of Michael
Jordan, a drama that has as much to do with his singular
determination as his supernal talent, and never loses its appeal
even though we have seen it before. The Bulls are losing, the Bulls
are running out of time, so here comes Jordan, ready for yet
another display of virtuosity and iron will. With 37.1 seconds to
go, he drives through traffic for a layup, cutting the Jazz's lead
to one point. With 18.9 seconds to go, he regains possession by
stripping the ball from an unsuspecting Malone, then calmly brings
the ball over midcourt, fakes his defender and, with 5.2 ticks
left, sinks an 18-foot jump shot to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   The issue now is whether we will ever see Jordan on center stage
again, with this cast or any other. Reinsdorf wants Jordan back.
But Jordan has said that he will not play for the Bulls unless
Coach Jackson and Pippen return, and both want big money. Then
again, Jordan cannot move elsewhere unless he is willing to absorb
a huge pay cut. Even under present salary cap rules, which the
owners are determined to tighten in negotiations this summer, no
other team can come close to matching his salary.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to predict the outcome of this chess game, but of one
thing we are (fairly) sure: Jordan will be playing somewhere. He
simply does not look like a man ready to retire, and hardly anyone,
including the league, wants him to.

JAZZ WINNERS FOR ALL TASTES

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first annual Jazz Awards, produced by Knit Media
and benefiting two organizations supporting destitute musicians,
Musicares and the Jazz Foundation of America, were presented Monday
night at Alice Tully Hall Monday night. Eric Bogosian was the
master of ceremonies, and Joe Henderson, Alice and Ravi Coltrane,
Geri Allen and others were scheduled to perform.
</P>
<P>
   For each of the 24 categories listed, separate awards were given
by two nominating bodies: one a consortium of record producers,
members of the news media, club owners, managers and agents; the
other the Jazz Journalists Association, a worldwide group of
critics. Predictably, the critics and industry voters had different
opinions on all but four categories.
</P>
<P>
   For best artist in performance, the winners were Danilo Perez
(from the industry) and the Mingus Big Band (from the journalists).
The lifetime achievement award was similarly split between Benny
Carter and Max Roach; the BMI best composer award, Wynton Marsalis
and Maria Schneider; recording of the year, Pat Metheny and Charlie
Haden's ``Beyond the Missouri Sky'' (Verve) and T.S. Monk's ``Monk
on Monk'' (N2K); best debut artist, Brad Mehldau and Olu Dara, and
musician of the year, Wynton Marsalis and Ornette Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   Winners in both camps were Sonny Rollins, improviser of the
year; Mingus Big Band, for big band; Kenny Barron, keyboardist, and
Rollins, tenor saxophonist.

A MUSLIM ARTIST AND HINDU IMAGES: IT'S A VOLATILE MIX 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the second time in less than two years, India's most famous
artist, Maqbool Fida Husain, has become a target of the country's
most militant Hindu activists.
</P>
<P>
   Early in May, members of the far-right Bajrang Dal, upset at a
stylized portrait of a Hindu goddess, slipped into Husain's Bombay
apartment, destroyed one painting and mauled several canvases
before being arrested by the police.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, high-ranking officials of the ruling Bharatiya
Janata Party, while distancing themselves from the attack, have
asked him to refrain from what they call his perverted works of
art, while many of the country's most prominent artists and writers
have rallied around him, criticizing attempts to fetter free
expression.
</P>
<P>
   Husain himself, however, seems unruffled, taking what he
euphemistically called a philosophical approach to the whole furor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very minor,'' he said impatiently in a telephone
interview from London, where his paintings were being offered at
Christie's auction house. ``The door was open. I went out. Some
people came.'' When pressed for details, he demurred. ``My house is
an open house,'' he said. ``Everybody is welcome. They are my
people. I belong to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But Husain, a Muslim who has filled many a canvas with
scenes and portraits taken from Hindu mythology, has recently
become the most prominent whipping boy for his country's Hindu
militants. In November 1996, a mob ransacked one of Husain's
galleries in Ahmedabad over another painting, a partly nude
representation of the Hindu goddess of arts and letters, called
Saraswati, bringing loud cries against censorship.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery has since closed, but even his shows abroad have not
been immune. Last summer a display at A Gallery on West 23rd Street
in Manhattan drew a small clutch of peaceful protesters.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Husain, whose long and prolific career has
mirrored the boom in Indian contemporary art over the last 10
years, expressed little surprise. At 83, he remembers the
Hindu-Muslim antagonisms that preceded India's independence in
1947, the year he displayed his first canvas in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the British time, I saw riots in Bombay,'' he
recalled, adding that India is steeped in religion. ``It is the one
thing that you should not touch. I touched it. But they
misunderstood it.`
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Husain's brush has always touched religion. The
portraits that have set off the Hindu militants in recent years
were done several years ago. He has painted a long series based on
``The Mahabharata,'' the Hindu epic, and also completed a series on
the world's 10 major religions, including humanism.

   Recently, his imagination has turned to the movies, which in
India can be as vital as matters of faith. ``As Woody Allen says,
`Cinema is the only reality,' and that is more true in India,''
Husain observed. ``Imagine what violence if there was no cinema.
And I mean popular cinema, not the arty-arty, which is dull.'

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the day that Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. announced its
plans to go public, Jon Corzine and Henry Paulson Jr. might have
been expected to relax, even exult a little.
</P>
<P>
   After all, they have succeeded where at least two generations of
Goldman leaders repeatedly failed, persuading a famously feisty but
publicity-shy partnership to dissolve itself and embrace what it
had long shunned _ a brave new world of expansion, acquisitions,
stock options and shareholder meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in a whirlwind of conference calls, video links, press
interviews and hand-holding sessions, Corzine and Paulson,
co-chairmen and co-chief executives of the big investment bank,
spent much of the day Monday emphasizing what Goldman will not do,
how it will not change its ways.
</P>
<P>
   Partners will not hoard the proceeds of a public offering, they
said. Defying conventional wisdom, Goldman, Wall Street's premier
blue-chip firm, has no interest in buying a Main Street brokerage
firm, they stressed. Goldman will not entertain merger proposals,
with commercial banks or anyone else, they insisted, and will never
permit the firm's culture to be diluted by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to what you might read, we are not doing this because
of the money,'' Corzine said. ``This is not about money or cashing
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulson, spelling out how Goldman plans to distinguish itself in
the future from its metamorphosing rivals, added, ``We don't think
that being a financial conglomerate is the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The co-leaders have reasons for their naysaying. A frenzy of
speculation has accompanied Goldman's decision to go public, both
inside its workaday headquarters at 85 Broad St. and up and down
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Employees want to know how they will share the wealth. Market
analysts wonder whether Goldman's decision to go public perhaps
signifies the top of the long bull market in stocks. Rival
financial institutions want to know if they are suitable marriage
partners for the Street's most eligible bachelor.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman may have handled hundreds, even thousands, of initial
public offerings in recent years, but selling itself to investors
is shaping up to be the trickiest of all.
</P>
<P>
   The firm looks set to put a princely price tag on itself,
perhaps $30 billion, listing enough of itself on the stock market
to qualify as the largest single initial sale of shares in U.S.
history. But the co-chairmen say their company consists above all
of ``elevator assets,'' people who walk out the door each night.
That leaves no room for upheaval, little margin for error.
</P>
<P>
   The co-leaders are also under pressure to present a strategy for
growth that will justify the high price they plan to place on their
own stock. Measured as a multiple of book value, or assets minus
liabilities, Goldman is contemplating selling stock at prices
roughly double what shares in securities firms traded for just two
years ago. What is more, Goldman will be entering at a time when
some analysts say the market is peaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are very smart, the best on Wall Street, and they
are saying it is time to sell shares,'' said Kathleen Smith,
manager of a $10 million fund at Renaissance Capital Corp. that
invests in initial public offerings. ``Is this the top? If anybody
knows, they would.''
</P>
<P>
   In their first formal interview as co-chairmen _ Paulson was
elevated to share the top executive spots with Corzine earlier this
month _ they sought to assuage some of those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   They also put forward an agenda for growth, which _ if shy of
the aggressive wanderlust of rivals like Sanford Weill, the
chairman of Travelers Group, who recently agreed to merge his
company with Citicorp, the largest financial deal in history _ is
plenty daring by the standards of Goldman's own cautious history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to be the pre-eminent, independent global investment
bank,'' Corzine said, stressing the word ``independent.'' ``We are
going to be damn tough, and we will have the capital to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   What is at the top of their agenda? Increasing Goldman's asset
management business, which involves handling the investments in
stocks and bonds of institutions and wealthy individuals. The firm
has some $160 billion under management but is eager to increase
that figure as rapidly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   They said the firm had already studied buying the kinds of big
fund management companies that a private Goldman might have found
it hard to swallow, given that it had only cash, not stock, with
which to make purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman sees the asset management business as particularly
desirable because it generates relatively steady and reliable
returns compared with trading and underwriting, two of Goldman's
main revenue sources today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have some new strategic opportunities, and we will go
into acquisition mode,'' Corzine said. ``I am not talking about
mergers, but acquisitions.'' He declined to specify any companies
on Goldman target list, joking that ``we want to buy them when they
are cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   The two executives also said they had expansion plans in Japan
and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Europe, Paulson said, looks enticing because monetary union
there will create new opportunities for cross-border fund
management. Japan, Corzine said, is in the ``throes of a
revolution,'' as Tokyo deregulates long-sheltered markets and the
Japanese look to foreign firms to manage their money. ``There is
access to clients there today that we never had before,'' Corzine
added.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, Goldman plans to broaden its private client
services business, which is intended for rich people. It has
rejected the idea of buying or merging with a retail broker, of the
type that deals with middle-class American investors. ``We simply
do not see ourselves getting into retail,'' Paulson said, declaring
that territory ``off strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Also declared ``off strategy'' was any alliance with a
commercial bank, including the suitor mentioned most often, Chase
Manhattan Bank. The two Goldman leaders said that they saw few
reasons to join Goldman's core operations and those of a commercial
bank, and that Goldman had no designs on traditional banking.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps foremost on the agenda of the two top partners
Monday was their commitment to keeping Goldman's culture of
self-effacing, behind-the-scenes teamwork relatively unchanged and
to preserving as many elements of its partnership as possible.
</P>
<P>
   To insure that Goldman does not lose key members of its staff,
the two executives said they had decided to share the wealth in a
way that they said was ``unprecedented'' compared with other Wall
Street firms that had gone public and with other recent offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Every full-time Goldman employee will get at least some stock
bonus, they said. But none will receive cash, and the stock will be
``restricted,'' so that those who receive it will not be able to
sell immediately. Paulson said the moratorium on stock sales could
be seven years or longer, but he declined to specify an exact
figure, saying it was still under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be spread broadly, deeply and generously,'' Corzine
said. ``I do not know of any other company that has done anything
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   They declined to specify how they would divide the wealth and
said most previous reports were wrong. But some people within the
firm say that if Goldman is valued at $30 billion, then they expect
about $8 billion of that stock to be reserved for people below the
level of partner, including managing directors, vice presidents and
associates who make up Goldman's front-line force.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave the 190 partners with about $22 billion in
equity. Senior partners are expected to have stakes worth $125
million to $150 million, while junior partners would get ownership
shares that range from $50 million to $80 million, people at the
firm say.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders acknowledged that Goldman had recently
experienced some extraordinary times. Monday, the firm announced
results for its second quarter in which it posted pretax profits of
just over $1 billion, up 70 percent from the corresponding period a
year earlier. That continues a strong trend in which Goldman
appears likely to trump last year's record profits of $3 billion
comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine and Paulson were not allowed to boast about the latest
figures. They now have lawyers advising them as to what they can
and cannot say as a potential public company considering a share
offering, and they have taken the advice seriously. But Paulson
gave a synopsis of his thinking that does not suggest a firm about
to remake itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound arrogant, because I don't feel
arrogant,'' he said. ``But when we look around at all the big
mergers and what our competitors are doing, we are very happy with
who we are.'' &QL;

CART PROBLEMS BEDEVIL MARTIN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When the U.S. Open begins on Thursday, Casey
Martin may be more worried about his cart than his golf game.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's one-seat cart broke down after his opening tee shot
during Monday's practice round at the Olympic Club. A backup cart
was brought to him on the second hole, but a wheel came off the
ground when he pulled away after his tee shot. Unhappy with the way
that cart handled, Martin walked for two holes before a regular
cart was brought to him on the fourth hole. He used it for the rest
of his round.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who suffers from a rare circulatory disorder in his
right leg, will become the first player to use a cart at the U.S.
Open. Monday was the second time in two weeks that Martin has
encountered problems with the one-seat cart.
</P>
<P>
   In his sectional qualifier in Cincinnati last week, his cart
would not start after his tee shot on No. 3, forcing him to walk
for two holes. After Monday's round, Martin said he would ride
whatever cart the U.S. Golf Association told him to ride on
Thursday, but he would prefer to have a regular cart. &QL;

MICROSOFT AND COMPAQ TO BUY 10 PERCENT STAKES IN ROAD RUNNER 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. said Monday that they
would each invest $212.5 million for 10 percent stakes in Road
Runner, the high-speed cable-modem joint venture of Time Warner
Inc., Time Warner Entertainment/Advance-Newhouse and the Mediaone
Group.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the deal reflected the interest of Microsoft and
Compaq in fostering the growth of high-speed Internet connections
for home users. For most users, the Internet experience is limited
by the amount of information that can be squeezed through a
telephone line.
</P>
<P>
   Until the current bottleneck in this information plumbing, or
bandwidth, can be opened, consumers will find little performance
gained in buying more powerful computers or new software.
</P>
<P>
   Cable modems and a competing telephone line technology known as
ADSL, for Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Link, promise to break
through this traffic jam. Under optimal circumstances cable modems
and some configurations of ADSL can pump about 4 million bits a
second from the Internet into a PC, compared with a maximum speed
of fewer than 56,000 bits a second from the fastest dial-up modems.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, Compaq and other leaders in the personal computer
industry are investing in both cable modems and ADSL technology in
the hope that high-speed Internet connections will increase sales
of higher-speed computers and associated software.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, they are spreading their bets. Last year, Microsoft
bought a $1 billion stake in Comcast Corp., a major cable company
that owns a small interest in the At Home Network, a provider of
cable Internet services. But Microsoft, Compaq and Intel Corp. are
also founding members of the ADSL Forum, a group promoting
high-speed data connections over telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line for both of these companies is it is in their
best interests to accelerate the arrival of high-bandwidth services
to consumers,'' said Michael Harris, an analyst with Kinetic
Strategies in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the glacial pace at which the telcos move, they're
probably better off pushing the cable companies,'' Harris added.
``But they are really agnostic; they just want more bandwidth to
the home no matter how it gets there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Road Runner venture, which was announced late last year but
officially closed Monday, says it has more than 90,000 subscribers,
compared with At Home's 110,000 users. As part of their effort to
accelerate the delivery of broadband services over cable modems to
consumers and small businesses, Microsoft will provide the new
venture its expertise in Internet, client, server and application
software, while Compaq said it would deliver PCs with pre-installed
cable modems to the market by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real objective here is to make high-speed cable access the
dominant technology,'' said Doug Holmes, executive vice president
for strategy and business development of Mediaone, the broadband
and cable unit of the US West, which split last week. ``To that
extent, we and At Home are complementary. We expect to collaborate
with At Home.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jermoluk, At Home's president and chief executive, cast
the deal with Compaq and Microsoft in a similar light. ``It's good
to have them investing in cable,'' Jermoluk said. ``We don't
compete with Road Runner; there's no overlap. Any technology they
develop in their partnership with Road Runner will only help us.''
</P>
<P>
   At Home has not worked with Compaq, but has joined with
Microsoft to improve server software for its Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's chairman and chief executive, Bill Gates, said in a
statement, ``This venture brings the right combination of
technology and Internet access to make high-speed Internet
connectivity a reality for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Internet Explorer is currently the standard Web
browser offered with Road Runner's service, but users can change to
Netscape Navigator or other programs as they wish. At Home users
now get a highly customized version of Navigator but will soon be
able to choose between Navigator and Explorer at the time their
service is installed.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership of Road Runner on a fully diluted basis will break
down as follows: Microsoft and Compaq each will have 10 percent;
Time Warner Inc. will have about 9 percent; Time Warner
Entertainment (through its Time Warner Cable division), in which
Time Warner Inc. and Mediaone Group are partners, will have about
20 percent; Mediaone Group will have about 25 percent, and Time
Warner Entertainment/Advance-Newhouse will have about 26 percent.
Advance/Newhouse is a partnership of Advance Communications Corp.,
a subsidiary of Advance Publications Inc. and Newhouse Broadcasting
Corp. &QL;

MONSANTO CITED IN COTTON CROP LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three Mississippi cotton farmers who planted genetically
engineered seed, then watched as their cotton bolls shriveled and
fell to the ground, should be paid more than $1.9 million by
Monsanto Co. and two seed companies for their losses, an
arbitration council of the Mississippi Department of Agriculture
and Commerce ruled on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi Seed Arbitration Council's decision is not
binding and it was unclear Monday whether Monsanto, along with
Delta and Pine Land Co. and its subsidiary, Paymaster Technology
Co., which are both now being purchased by Monsanto, would pay the
ordered amount.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-five Mississippi farmers who used Roundup Ready cotton
seed complained to the arbitration council last fall, saying the
seed, which incorporated a gene developed by Monsanto that was
supposed to allow the cotton to be sprayed with a herbicide to
control weeds without damaging the cotton, led to lower yields.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those cases were settled privately, bringing the farmers
perhaps $5 million or less, said Steve Cox, the lawyer for the
farmers. &QL;

<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ Like a first kiss, getting the car keys
for the first time or walking into a bar and buying a first drink,
gambling has become a rite of passage for young people on their way
to adulthood. From New Jersey, up and down the Mississippi River
and west to Nevada, with casinos in 26 states and lotteries in 38,
youths who have watched their parents choose from a hefty menu of
legalized gambling activities right in their back yards are going
on dates, spending their prom nights and joining college classmates
at the nearest casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that young people said, `I'm 21, let's go have a
drink,''' said Dr. Howard Shaffer, a professor of psychology at
Harvard University. ``Now they say, `I'm 21, let's go gamble.'''
</P>
<P>
   Along with this change in the American cultural scene, there is
also a growing concern among experts on compulsive gambling about
the number of youths who _ confronted with state lotteries, the
growth of family-oriented casinos and sometimes lax enforcement of
wagering laws _ gamble at an earlier and earlier age and gamble
excessively.
</P>
<P>
   They fear the proliferation of youthful gambling will lead to
more cases like that of a young Philadelphia man who became an
addicted gambler as a teen-ager. For the young man, now 27, the
``bottom'' came after he had made two trips to prison for credit
card fraud and writing false checks, attempted suicide and robbed
his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I was 17, my parents had put a lock on everything
in the house _ bedrooms, pantries, closets,'' said the man,
Michael, who is in a treatment program for compulsive gamblers.
Like other addicts in recovery progams, Michael agreed to be
identified only by his first name. ``If I could take 30 towels out
of the linen closet I would sell them for $10 to place a bet,'' he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   A study conducted last year by Louisiana State University found
that one in seven Louisianians ages 18 to 21 were problem gamblers,
some of them pathological _ youths with a chronic and progressive
psychological disorder characterized by an emotional dependence on
gambling and a loss of control over their gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer recently conducted an analysis of nationwide studies of
gambling addiction in which he found that the rate of problem
gambling among adolescents was 9.4 percent, more than twice the 3.8
percent rate for adults. ``Young people have been gambling since
the beginning of time,'' he said. ``But I think now, for the first
time, young people are growing up having lived their entire lives
in a social environment where gambling is promoted and socially
accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Children get their lessons in wagering all around them _ from
the sports trading cards that they buy hoping to find one with an
instant and large monetary value to the chocolate chip cookie
company that advertises during Saturday-morning cartoons, offering
$1,000 to the lucky child who buys a package with the chocolate
chips missing. Although children have been gambling for years, the
fundamental principle of gambling _ buying a chance to win more
money _ is indeed more prevalent in the lives of young people than
it has ever been, some experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The local governments that sponsor lotteries, as well as the
casino industry and other businesses, do their part, whether
intentional or not, to enhance gambling's appeal in the eyes of the
young. Lottery scratch cards have bright, cartoonish graphics.
Video poker machines resemble the video machines that a generation
of children have grown up playing. Video arcades for children along
the Boardwalk in Atlantic City include reconditioned slot machines
that work just like the real thing but offer prizes instead of
money.
</P>
<P>
   And the casino industry, by surrounding itself with amusement
parks and attractions that appeal to the young, has given parents a
reason to bring children along when they visit places like Atlantic
City and Las Vegas _ introducing adolescents to casinos, and
cultivating future gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Market-savvy managers are grooming the next generation,'' said
Marvin Roffman, a Philadelphia-based gambling analyst. ``The kids
go to the amusement park for the day, and when the family gets back
to the hotel room, Dad is talking about how he did at the blackjack
tables and Mom is talking about how she did at the slots. The kids
are listening and it's making an impression on them.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many other things to worry about, like teen-age
pregnancy, drug abuse and drunken driving, many parents and
educators say they have not yet focused on gambling as one of their
major concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we have students, probably a large number of students,
who gamble,'' conceded William Steele, the principal of Atlantic
City High School. On the desk in his outer office there is a stack
of pamphlets for students to read about compulsive gambling. And
although the school's student resource center lists counseling for
problem gambling as one of the services it provides, Steele
admitted that little has been done to encourage students to seek
help for gambling problems. ``It's not an area that we have taken a
keen interest in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that like other rites of passage, gambling will prove
harmless in the long term for most of the young people who try it.
Shaffer said that many teen-agers experimented with gambling and
lost interest as they became adults. One primary reason that
teen-agers are so interested in gambling, he said, is that adults
have failed to inform them of the dangers. ``I think it's because
of the whole social milieu that we've provided these young
people,'' he said.

<P>
   The Problem: Teen-Agers Losing Control of the Dice
</P>
<P>
   While much is left to be learned about the long-term impact of
gambling's pervasiveness, it is already quite clear that some
youths are destined to have problems with their gambling. Gambling
experts estimate that 10 to 15 percent of youths who gamble become
``problem gamblers,'' meaning they suffer some loss of control over
their gambling behavior. And according to the Council on Compulsive
Gambling of New Jersey, of those who experience more severe
problems and become pathological gamblers, most are people who
start gambling before they reach 14.
</P>
<P>
   One such case is that of Malcolm, a 17-year-old youth from
Plainfield, N.J., who at 13 was playing craps in his neighborhood
and wagering on pick-up basketball games and ``see-low,'' a game
played with three dice that is popular among teen-age gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always gambled, so I thought that I may have a problem,''
Malcolm said. After a recent conviction for marijuana possession,
Malcolm was sent to New Hope Foundation, an in-patient addiction
center in Marlboro, N.J. Compulsive gambling was diagnosed, and now
he receives treatment for both drug and gambling problems.
</P>
<P>
   Cole DiMattio, one of Malcolm's counselors at the center, said
that it was Malcolm's interest in gambling that led him to drugs.
``All of his gambling,'' DiMattio said, ``looking for that crowd,
brought him into the drug culture.'' When he was a child, Malcolm
said in a recent telephone interview, his parents often played the
state lottery and visited the casinos in Atlantic City. ``They
didn't take me with them'' he said. ``But I wanted to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Lorenz, executive director of the Compulsive Gambling
Center, a treatment program in Baltimore, said that while many
teen-agers were compulsive gamblers, few sought treatment while
they were still in their teens. ``It just takes a while for the
addiction to develop,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael is a case in point. He traced his interest in gambling
back to growing up in Philadelphia, where he helped his grandmother
pick lottery numbers at the corner store and joined her on frequent
trips to Atlantic City, an hour's drive away. He recalled standing
outside the old Playboy casino, peering through its gigantic
window.

   ``I stood outside that glass and watched my grandmother and
thought, all I ever want in life is to be on the other side of that
glass,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He got on the other side before long, he said, and by 15 he had
used fake ID's and was a regular at the casinos, receiving free
limousine rides to and from Philadelphia and complimentary hotel
rooms from casinos that rarely questioned his age. Betting $100 to
$2,000 a hand on blackjack, he financed his gambling any way he
could. He said he robbed local prostitutes several times and in a
single week wrote $35,000 in bad checks at the bank where his
father was a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of those prostitutes could have blown my head off,'' he
said. ``But it didn't matter, as long as I was able to stay in
action, that's all that mattered.'' He is now married, working at a
bakery and living in southern New Jersey. He attends meetings of
Gamblers Anonymous, he said, and has not placed a bet in four
years.
</P>
<P>
   But not all young problem gamblers are able to withstand the
travails wrought by their excessive wagering. Last November, just
after running up a $6,000 debt betting on the World Series, Moshe
Pergament, a 19-year-old college student from an affluent Long
Island family, decided to end his gambling, and his life. He bought
a toy handgun and drove erratically on the Long Island Expressway,
causing police officers to stop him. When he was pulled over, he
aimed the gun at the officers, who responded by shooting and
killing him. Police said they found letters in Pergament's car that
revealed the gambling debt and his intention of having police shoot
him, a phenomenon known as ``suicide by cop.''

   The Policing: Officials Watch, Trying to Respond
</P>
<P>
   In parts of the country where gambling has flourished especially
fast, the problem with under-age gambling is particularly acute. In
Louisiana, a state that has long had horse racing and back-room
card games but over the last decade has added riverboat casinos,
video poker machines, a state lottery and casinos operated by
Native Americans, officials were jolted into action after the
Louisiana State University study found that youths there were three
times as likely as adults to become problem gamblers. The study,
conducted by the department of psychiatry, surveyed 12,066
adolescents grades six through twelve in public and private schools
in the 1996-97 school year.
</P>
<P>
   The Louisiana Legislature this year raised to 21 from 18 the
minimum age for playing the state lottery and video poker machines
inside more than 5,000 bars, restaurants and truck stops. Most
states require lottery players to be at least 18. About half the
states with casinos or video poker and slot machines allow
18-year-olds to play, while the other half, including Nevada and
New Jersey, require those gamblers to be at least 21. The majority
of states with parimutuel betting on events like horse racing, dog
racing and jai alai allow 18-year-olds to bet.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, after a local television reporter used an
undercover camera recently to show that under-age gamblers were
easily boarding the more than a dozen casino riverboats docked
around the state, state gambling regulators are now threatening to
rescind the licenses of casino operators who cannot keep under-age
gamblers off their boats. In other states with legalized gambling,
there are similar concerns. A citizen watchdog group in Illinois,
for example, recently filmed under-age students drinking and
gambling on the state's riverboats. The state gaming board then
took steps to enforce age minimums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is, under-age gambling is a little
like under-age drinking,'' said John Kennedy, Louisiana's secretary
of revenue and a member of the state gaming control board.
``Minors, by definition, don't have the reasoning power of adults.
If you don't have the reasoning power than you can't know your
limits.''

   Still, many teen-agers simply do not want to wait until they are
old enough to gamble. In Atlantic City last year 38,502 juveniles
were escorted out of the city's 12 casinos, according to the
state's casino control commission. An additional 52,364 under-age
would-be gamblers tried to enter a casino and were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, though, experts say, enforcement is lax.
</P>
<P>
   A familiar scene played itself out recently at the Tropicana
Casino here. Madelyn Carabello was locked in a hypnotic trance as
she dropped coins in a slot machine and watched the reels spin to a
stop. After she had been playing for an hour and a half, a security
guard approached her and asked for identification, then escorted
her out. If her flawlessly youthful face, striped denim jeans and
tennis shoes were not enough to tip the casino's security staff
that it had an under-age gambler in its midst, surely the gold
pendant around her neck was a dead giveaway. It was a large heart,
surrounding the numeral 19, her age.
</P>
<P>
   But despite her age, it was not the first time that Ms.
Carabello, a freshman at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New
York City, had gambled in a casino.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled the eagerness with which she and 10 classmates
boarded a gambling boat on their prom night in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard that you only had to be 18'' to gamble on the boat,
she said.``I had heard how it was in a casino, that you could win
money and stuff. I was like, `Okay, let's do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Youths gamble because they see everyone around them doing it _
not because they care that lotteries are sanctioned by the state or
that casinos are legal, said Henry Lesieur, president of the
Institute for Problem Gambling in Pawtucket, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that kids are thinking at this level,'' he said.
``whether the state sanctions it or or not is irrelevant. What is
relevant is that it is available in places like the grocery store
and they can see it being advertised on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The casino industry, keenly aware of the potential for
compulsive gambling to become the bane that nicotine addiction is
to the tobacco industry _ and aware that a presidential commission
will issue a comprehensive report next year on the impact of
gambling on the country _ has recently begun to acknowledge the
problem and take pre-emptive steps. New programs to discourage
under-age gambling are being paid for and implemented by the
industry, and studies on compulsive gambling, particularly among
under-age gamblers, are being conducted through research grants
from the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the under-age gaming going on in this country is not
going on inside the casinos,'' said Frank Fahrenkopf, president of
the American Gaming Association, the casino industry's lobbying
organization. He pointed out that many young people gamble on
sports and play lotteries. ``We are trying to reach out to that
area of the population.''
</P>
<P>
   The interest that children develop in gambling often starts long
before they are old enough to sneak into a casino. A group of Long
Island parents, concerned that their young children were hooked on
sports trading cards, filed lawsuits against six of the major
sports trading card companies in 1996, claiming that the companies
have colluded to conduct an illegal gambling enterprise by
inserting rare and valuable cards that could instantly be redeemed
for cash. The lawsuits, filed in New York, New Jersey, Texas and
California, are pending, although one claim in Texas was dismissed
by the court there.
</P>
<P>
   James Schaefer, an anthropologist at Union College in
Schenectady, N.Y., who conducted research for the plaintiffs,
visited card shops and sports memorabilia shows where the cards are
bought and traded. What he found was that children as young as 6
were doing what is known as ``insert card chasing'' _ spending $2
to $6 for a pack of cards, ripping them open, quickly flipping
through them in search of the valuable inserts, discarding the
``garbage cards'' and buying more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are driven to find a valuable insert card, and
they'll spend all the money they have to find it,'' Schaefer said.
Some gambling opponents have raised similar concerns about other
seemingly benign products aimed at children, like the
scratch-and-win promotions often offered by McDonald's, and a
current promotion by Nabisco, which offers $1,000 to anyone who
finds a bag of Chips a'hoy cookies without any chocolate chips. Ann
Smith, a spokeswoman for Nabisco, denied that such promotions
encourage gambling. ``They are purchasing the product,'' she said.
``It's a consumer promotion geared towards added value.''
</P>
<P>
   The Next Bet: Coping in a Culture of Gambling
</P>
<P>
   Many students in places like Atlantic City become familiar with
casino games because they work after school or in summer at the
casinos. Although customers must be 21, the minimum age for working
at a casino is 18. Many young gamblers said that they had jobs and
financed their habit using the same disposable income that other
young people spend at the movies or the mall. However, gambling
experts said that many of those who gamble at school or elsewhere
come from affluent families and have more money than the average
student.
</P>
<P>
   Casinos here and in other cities have created opportunities for
young people. In addition to jobs, they provide a wide range of
assistance to local teen-agers, from scholarships to mentoring
programs. But with some of those same young people becoming
increasingly fascinated with gambling, some communities are now
questioning whether they should accept any largess from the casinos
in their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, casino employees participate in career days at
high schools, and casinos have donated just about everything to
students, from pumpkins for Halloween to playing cards emblazoned
with casino logos. But now, after opponents of gambling complained
that these donations were were only veiled attempts by the casinos
to cultivate future loyal customers, gambling regulators are
considering a ban on donations from casinos to students. ``We are
trying to make a determination as to whether the stuff they do in
the schools is marketing,'' said Hillary Crain, chairman of the
state's gaming control board.
</P>

   Many experts said that the best method for dealing with the
escalating interest in gambling among youths is to teach them more
about the potential downside to gambling, and to get them to better
understand probability _ the ratio of the number of times that
something will probably occur to the number of possible
occurrences. If they better understood the extent to which the odds
are against them, experts said, fewer children would be so anxious
to gamble. Still, said Edward Looney, the executive director of the
Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey, ``Youngsters are
youngsters, and gambling is an exciting thing for them to do
because it's risky.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as schools preach against gambling, in many places it
has become a part of the culture of adolescence. Growing up in
Warwick, R.I., where residents can bet on the state lottery, jai
alai and dog races, play video lottery machines or drive to the
Foxwoods casino an hour away in Connecticut, Seth Jackson anxiously
awaited the day he turned 21 and could step into a big,
rambunctious casino to gamble to his heart's content.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big deal for me the first time,'' Jackson, 22, a
senior at George Washington University, said during a recent
``senior week'' bus trip to Atlantic City, the gambling capital of
the East Coast. ``Everybody around me gambled when I was growing
up,'' he said, as he stood surrounded by classmates and slot
machines inside the Tropicana.
</P>
<P>
   At Atlantic City High School here, students said that betting on
sports and playing card games for money was common. Several
students said in interviews that they knew of a fellow student who
worked as a professional bookie, laying odds on games and
collecting bets. ``The guy books bets right in school,'' said Tom
Le, 16, a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   In May, on the night of the school's senior prom, one of the
activities arranged for the evening was a mock casino, set up
inside the cafeteria. Students received chips and played casino
games like blackjack and craps. ``I was really astonished at how
well they knew the games,'' said Steele, the principal. He said he
believed that gambling had captured the fancy of young people
because it made them feel like adults. ``I guess it's a nice
feeling to go into the casino, play and receive complimentary
drinks,'' he said. ``How can you tell them, here it is, it's
exciting, but you can't do it? We have to face it, it's here to
stay. It's a matter that's going to have to be dealt with. I don't
know how. Just hope and pray that it's done on a small scale.''

MALL DEVELOPER AIMS TO ATTRACT SHOPPERS FROM MANHATTAN 
 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Ohio developer announced Monday that his company had secured
$163 million in bank loans to build one of the larger malls in the
New York City metropolitan area: a shopping and entertainment
complex that will rise on a 110-acre site near Newark International
Airport, with a view of the Manhattan skyline.
</P>
<P>
   At 1.3 million square feet, the planned Jersey Gardens mall in
Elizabeth, just across from Staten Island, would be the
eighth-largest mall in New Jersey. But it is its proximity to New
York City, the appeal of its 3 percent sales tax and developers'
plans to make it a tourist attraction that has caught the attention
of city officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real long shot to think that tourists would choose
Elizabeth, New Jersey, over Manhattan,'' New York Deputy Mayor
Randy Levine said. ``I mean, who gets on a plane and says, `Honey,
let's go fly to Elizabeth.'''
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Glimcher, the chairman and chief executive of Glimcher
Realty Trust, a developer of shopping malls based in Columbus,
Ohio, said the mall would feature more than 200 stores, anchored by
12 national retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Glimcher said he would not release the names of the anchor
stores until negotiations were completed. The mall will include a
multiplex theater and a food court. But the centerpiece will be an
entertainment complex designed by Michael Ovitz, the former
president of Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   Glimcher said the entire mall would have a sports and
entertainment theme. He declined to give details of Ovitz's
complex, but said it would include interactive sports games.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Ovitz would also help on other aspects of the mall
design. The two are working on similar mall projects in Columbus
and in Carson, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Glimcher said that David Rockwell, a New York architect, is
helping with the design. Rockwell has been involved in designing
many entertainment attractions, including the Academy Awards
Theater in Hollywood and improvements to Radio City Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Workers broke ground on the project in April, but Glimcher said
Monday that the last obstacle to his plan was removed when
Huntington National Bank and Bankers Trust agreed to loan his
company $163 million of the $360 million needed for the project.
Glimcher's company is putting up $56 million for the project and
about $140 million is coming from state economic development bonds
and government grants.
</P>
<P>
   Glimcher said he expected that the mall would open in late 1999
and would draw more than 30 million visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be an exciting place to come to, hopefully a
destination place for many,'' he said. ``We won't have a roller
coaster, but we are going to have a lot of exciting entertainment
features.''
</P>
<P>
   Malachy Kavanagh, a spokesman for the International Council of
Shopping Centers, said that the industry was eagerly awaiting the
results of the Ovitz-Glimcher partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really coming out with a new mall concept that
everyone is waiting to see, primarily because Herb Glimcher has a
great reputation in the mall business and Michael Ovitz has a great
reputation in entertainment,'' Kavanagh said.
</P>
<P>
   The mall site, near Exit 13A of the New Jersey Turnpike, is in
one of the most congested areas in the state. In order to
accommodate the expected volume of visitors, Glimcher said he had
agreed to pay for millions of dollars in road improvements and to
expand a toll plaza on the turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers at the Elizabeth site will benefit from no state taxes
on clothing or food. And because the mall is located in an urban
enterprise zone, the sales tax would be only 3 percent, half of the
normal rate for New Jersey. That compares with 8.25 percent in
Manhattan, accounting for local and state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth officials said the project would create 1,600
construction jobs and 5,200 permanent jobs, and would generate
between $4.6 million and $6.4 million in annual tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Christian Bollwage of Elizabeth said, ``The benefit to the
City of Elizabeth is that we are taking a former landfill that was
generating no tax revenue and turning it into something that will
benefit the city by creating jobs and revenue.''

NEW YORK MAYOR VISITS CAMDEN YARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has said his
heart wants to keep the New York Yankees in the Bronx although a
move to Manhattan might be more lucrative, visited Oriole Park at
Camden Yards here to see how a baseball stadium can fit into a
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Oriole Park, the home of the Baltimore Orioles, is perched just
west of the city's Inner Harbor amid a forest of the hotels, shops
and cybercafes that Giuliani contends would spring up around a new
Yankees stadium on the West Side of Manhattan. Giuliani checked out
the locker rooms, third base line and the 75 skyboxes, and
pronounced them worthy of emulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an enormously _ an enormously _ successful project,''
Giuliani said. ``When you look at the development that it's helped
in part to energize, it really is quite impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The stadium, which opened in 1992, was designed to evoke
turn-of-the-century parks, with steel trusses and a brick facade. A
team of Giuliani administration officials visited earlier and was
heartened to find that only one-fourth of the fans park at the
stadium. The rest arrive by train or walk from outlying garages,
which would be necessities for a Manhattan park.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, made light of the
mayor's field trip. ``Oriole Park was modeled on Yankee Stadium,''
he said. ``The mayor should come up to the Bronx and take a look.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also went to Baltimore to attend a ``Salute to Rudy
Giuliani'' reception that raised more than $20,000 for the
Baltimore City Republican Central Committee. Guests paid $100 to
have their pictures taken with Giuliani. For $25, they enjoyed the
buffet of corned beef and mile-long hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The local party chairman, David Blumberg, said Giuliani drew a
larger audience than several famous Republicans who had spoken to
the committee, including House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can touch this guy,'' Blumberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Parrying a question about his ambitions, Giuliani joked that he
might become a radio talk show host or baseball announcer.
</P>
<P>
   After speaking, Giuliani gave a copy of his new children's book,
``What Will You Be?,'' to Blumberg, who is also librarian of the
Baltimore City Jail. Giuliani said that he considered this
inscription for Blumberg's patrons: ``Glad you're there.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the evening, Giuliani watched the Yankees play the
Orioles at a second Republican fund-raiser, where 40 people paid
$1,000 each to watch the game with the mayor.

OFFICER IN SQUEEGEE-MAN SHOOTING HAS A CIVILIAN COMPLAINT RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York City police officer who was charged
Monday with the off-duty shooting of a squeegee man in the Bronx on
Sunday evening was removed from patrol duty earlier this year
because he had accumulated an unusually high number of complaints
of using excessive force against civilians, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The accused officer, Michael Meyer, 28, had previously been
transferred from his patrol post in the 75th Precinct in the East
New York section of Brooklyn and assigned to the Police
Department's buildings maintenance section, where he had little
contact with the public, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the officer's 9-millimeter service pistol was not taken away
when he was reassigned, police said. He is now accused of using
that pistol to critically injure Antoine Reid, a squeegee man who
had tried to wash the windshield of Meyer's car on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred shortly after 5 p.m. as Meyer drove his
girlfriend and her 6-year-old son home from a game at Yankee
Stadium, police said.
</P>
<P>
   As Meyer waited in traffic at an exit of the Major Deegan
Expressway near East 138th Street, police said, Reid began
spreading soap on the driver's side of the windshield of the
officer's white 1988 Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer objected, and witnesses told detectives that he yelled at
Reid and got out of his car. They argued physically and verbally,
said a police investigator who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in front of his girlfriend and her child, Meyer drew his
service pistol and fired a shot that passed through Reid's chest
and struck a blue car behind him that was carrying six people home
from the Puerto Rican Day parade, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer was arraigned Monday on charges of second-degree attempted
murder, assault, criminal possession of a weapon _ for using his
service pistol for an illegal act _ and reckless endangerment,
according to a complaint filed Monday in Bronx Criminal Court. He
was held on bail that was set at $50,000 in cash or a $100,000
bond. His lawyer, Bruce Smirti, did not return calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, who turned 38 Monday, was taken to Lincoln Hospital, where
his spleen was removed and he underwent surgery on his liver,
according to the criminal complaint. Monday night he remained in
critical but stable condition, unable to speak with detectives or
his family because he has a tube going down his throat, said Sister
Mary Caulfield, a hospital spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   As a police officer, Meyer had a history of disciplinary
problems. Earlier this year, he became one of 16 officers removed
from law enforcement duties under a new program designed to monitor
potentially troubled officers. The program calls for police
officials to monitor officers with six or more complaints of using
excessive force placed against them at the Civilian Complaint
Review Board within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that when they moved Meyer off patrol they could
not take away his service weapon without placing him on modified
duty, which involves formal charges and a hearing. The officials
noted that none of the civilian complaints against Meyer involved
the use of his firearm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is still allowed to carry his weapon because we had no
previous reason that he should not,'' Police Commissioner Howard
Safir said Monday in a news conference at City Hall. &QL;

GUILTY PLEAS ARE EXPECTED IN OFFICE CONSTRUCTION BID-RIGGING 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Five top executives and four companies in the
construction industry have agreed to plead guilty to collecting
kickbacks and rigging the bidding on billions of dollars in
renovation work for many of the city's most powerful corporations
during the 1990s, according to investigators and lawyers in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the executives will go to prison in the plea
arrangements with the Manhattan district attorney's office while
the individuals and companies will pay a total of $20 million in
fines, according to those involved.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which is expected to be announced Wednesday, is the
latest step in a long-running investigation that has already rocked
the multibillion-dollar interior construction industry and changed
the way business is done in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the companies and executives have also agreed to provide
information and testify in the ongoing investigation of corruption
throughout the industry, from major property owners, designers and
real estate brokers to the furniture and lighting suppliers for the
city's blue chip corporations and firms.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say that the companies unknowingly bore the
inflated expense of the bid-rigging scheme, although some of the
contractors maintain that they did not pass on the cost of the
bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike cases in the past that targeted corrupt construction
union officials or mobsters, the investigation by District Attorney
Robert Morgenthau has ensnared politically connected figures at the
top of one of the city's most important industries, which involves
the design and construction of office space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to look into criminal conduct which affects the
economic viability of the city,'' Morgenthau said Monday. ``The
interior construction industry is only the latest chapter in a book
that includes the carpenters union, the carting industry and co-op
managers. New York cannot be competitive if corrupt practitioners
are skimming 10 to 15 percent off the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cherkasky, the president of Kroll Associates, a
corporate investigations firm, said the investigation is having a
huge impact on the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big players, not two-bit hustlers,'' he said, ``and it
indicates that at the top layers of the industry, bribes and
payoffs were a way of doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherkasky, a former prosecutor, said that as a result of the
investigation, ``business is booming'' for his firm and others as
corporations hire them to monitor construction work.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the scheme, according to investigators,
contractors and defense lawyers, was Robert Bennis, a consultant
for Conde Nast Publications, Christie's auction house, the New York
Mercantile Exchange and many investment banks and law firms.
</P>
<P>
   Bennis, who is expected to plead guilty, was in a critical
position to steer work to favored contractors because his job was
to coordinate the leasing, design and construction of office space
for his corporate clients, according to investigators, some defense
attorneys and real estate executives.
</P>
<P>
   But the tiny club that defense lawyers and investigators say was
able to control much of the office construction work in Manhattan
also involved some of the biggest contractors in the country,
including AJ Contracting Co. and Structure Tone Inc. Structure
Tone's estimated 1997 revenues exceeded $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In return for $14 million in kickbacks between 1992 and 1997,
the executives at the center of the scheme steered contracts to
participating contractors that in some cases were worth more than
$100 million each, according to investigators and contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors about the pending plea agreements have been swirling
about the real estate industry for months. The district attorney's
office and lawyers for the executives declined to comment on the
case before the agreement is announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers on both sides of the plea negotiations, however,
confirmed the following:
</P>
<P>
   Bennis and his partner, Maurice Reissman, are expected to plead
guilty to bribery, pay about $3.3 million in fines and restitution
and serve up to three years in prison. Lawyers for the two men did
not return phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Bennis' lifelong friend and a contractor, Howard Lazar, has
struck a similar deal. Lazar, who pleaded guilty to attempted
bribery in the 1970s, drummed up business for the bid-rigging club
and used a company called JDL Holdings to funnel kickbacks to
Bennis. His brother, Gerald Lazar, is also expected to plead guilty
to charges related to the scheme, although he will not receive a
prison term. &QL;

FIRST CAPITAL CASE SINCE DEATH PENALTY REINSTATED BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVERHEAD, N.Y. _ Long Island's first capital punishment case
since New York's reinstatement of the death penalty in 1995 began
Monday with the judge telling prospective jurors that the trial
could last seven months.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Robert Shulman, 44, a former postal worker, is
charged with murdering three prostitutes in his small apartment in
Hicksville, dismembering their bodies and disposing of them in
garbage bins.
</P>
<P>
   He has pleaded not guilty, and insists that a lengthy detailed
confession that he signed during nearly 35 hours of questioning
following his arrest on April 6, 1996, was coerced by police.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 71 prospective jurors, 26 indicated an interest in
serving on the jury. They were asked to fill out a detailed
questionnaire that contained nearly 200 questions, some of them
concerning their views on the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Arthur Pitts noted that serving on the jury could create a
hardship, but said that those chosen would meet only once or twice
during the summer. He said that opening statements in the trial
were not scheduled until Sept. 8, the day after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Shulman, who is also charged in Westchester County with two
counts of murder for people found dumped in trash bins in Yonkers,
could be sentenced to death by the Suffolk jury if found guilty of
first-degree murder. &QL;

COLUMN: GOLDEN OLDIE FROM PATAKI _ DEATH DITTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is axiomatic in show business that if you want to
be sure to keep the audience, stick with what has worked before.
Gov. George Pataki is showing that the rules are pretty much the
same in politics.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty for this governor is what ``Hello Dolly'' is
for Carol Channing, a refrain that he hopes the crowd will never
tire of, no matter how familiar it has become. Banging the drum for
capital punishment paid off for him in 1994, and he is doing an
encore as he seeks re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki was exultant 10 days ago when a Brooklyn jury made Darrel
K. Harris, a convicted triple murderer, the first person to face a
lethal injection under New York state's death penalty law of 1995.
``This proves,'' he said, ``that we were right in seeking to pass
this law.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from that triumph, and amply patting himself on the back
for New York's sharp drop in violent crime, the governor asked last
week for legislation to make it easier than ever for juries to put
criminals to death.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed expanding the categories of murderers eligible for a
fatal needle at the Green Haven prison. Thrill killers, for
example, would be added to the list, along with those who kill for
insurance money or an inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   How much of a public-safety menace those particular villains are
is not clear. There are no signs of a big outbreak of New Yorkers
bopping spouses on the head to cash in on their life insurance. But
the governor is convinced that the capital punishment law he signed
in 1995 has reduced crime, so full steam ahead. ``As that success
continues, we must continue to do even more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It will be left to others to speculate on whether he means
business or is dabbling in the politics of death. If he is serious,
some lawmakers' aides said, he has an odd way of showing it,
submitting his bills just as the Legislature is about to fold its
tent.
</P>
<P>
   It will also be left to others to debate whether the governor
deserves the credit he claims for plummeting crime. Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani may have other thoughts, not to mention former Police
Commissioner William Bratton and his strategist, Jack Maple. After
all, the state can thank New York City for most of its decline in
murders.
</P>
<P>
   The concern here is with the Pataki exacta coupling capital
punishment and lower crime.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the murder rate in the city was dropping well before
Pataki _ and, for that matter, Giuliani _ took office. Also, the
decline was more rapid in the two years before the new death
penalty (39 percent) than in the two years that followed (35
percent).
</P>
<P>
   If capital punishment is such a devastating crime-buster, how is
it that, from 1995 to 1997, murders fell in the Bronx by 36 percent
and in Manhattan by 39 percent? In both boroughs, the district
attorneys have yet to seek death, and they make abundantly clear
they consider it a waste of crime-fighting resources.
</P>
<P>
   The borough with the smallest percentage decline in those two
years happened to be Brooklyn, where District Attorney Charles
Hynes has sought death five times, far more than any other
prosecutor in the state. To use the governor's logic, murder should
be disappearing much faster in Brooklyn than in Manhattan or the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   But the opposite is true. The 1995-97 decline was only 29
percent. Not that Hynes is surprised. He himself calls the capital
punishment law ``a sham.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality, reflected in data from the Death Penalty
Information Center in Washington, is that the average murder rate
in capital-punishment states is double that of the 12 states
without a death chamber.
</P>
<P>
   And consider Philadelphia. No district attorney in the country
has been more aggressive than that city's Lynne Abraham in asking
for the death penalty. Yet for the entire decade the number of
murders has stayed stubbornly above 400 a year, a rate now nearly
three times that of New York's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the Philadelphia DA's office doesn't make the argument
that the death penalty lowers the crime rate,'' said Robert Dunham,
director of the Center for Legal Education, Advocacy and Defense
Assistance, a nonprofit group that represents Philadelphians
sitting on death row. (The city has more people on death row, 120,
than 25 states.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What the death penalty does,'' he said, ``is provide the
public with the illusion of control, and a mechanism to express its
outrage over things it cannot control.'' &QL;

JUDGE BACKS LAWYER'S BID TO REPRESENT GOTTI'S SON 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bruce Cutler, the combative lawyer disqualified from
defending John J. Gotti seven years ago for being too close to the
mob, won a round for himself Monday when a judge upheld his right
to defend the son of the Dapper Don in a federal racketeering case
in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Barrington Parker Jr., who is to preside at the trial of
John A. Gotti and 15 other defendants in White Plains next fall,
rebuffed the government's move to exclude Cutler and a second
lawyer from the defense, but agreed to remove two other lawyers in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   The federal judge said Cutler might have been ``house counsel''
to the Gambino crime family in 1990, when wiretaps caught him
discussing mob secrets, making him a potential witness and thus
ineligible to defend the elder Gotti in a trial that sent him to
prison for life on murder and racketeering charges.
</P>
<P>
   But Parker held that the 1990 tapes, and even some made later by
the government, were not enough to show Cutler should be
disqualified now. ``The allegations concerning Cutler are years
old'' the judge said, and are ``largely unrelated to the current
indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had no comment, but Cutler said of the ruling: ``It
feels good to be back in the ring. That's where I belong.'' He said
he was looking forward to ``rolling up the sleeves and getting
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   John A. Gotti, who has been held without bail since January and
is said by prosecutors to be a captain in the organization once
controlled by his father, is accused with other defendants of
involvement in a telephone calling-card fraud, of extorting money
from construction companies and labor unions and of a conspiracy
that virtually took control of Scores, a Manhattan nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   While 23 defendants were indicted, seven have pleaded guilty,
and some will testify, leaving 16 defendants. The case, largely
based on 7,000 surveillance tapes, is seen as a major attack on the
remnants of a Mafia decimated by trials that sent many old-line
leaders to prison, and as a signal to mob successors that they face
relentless prosecution and imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   The successes came after years in which mobsters like John J.
Gotti, defended by lawyers like Cutler, seemed immune. Gotti, who
was found not guilty in assault, racketeering and shooting cases,
became known as ``the Teflon Don,'' and Cutler rode to national
prominence.
</P>
<P>
   But the streak ran out in the 1990s. Using tapes secretly
recorded by the government in a social club in Little Italy,
prosecutors moved in 1991 to disqualify Cutler, saying he had been
``house counsel'' for the Gambino family and, privy to mob secrets,
was a potential witness against his client. An appeals court later
called his disqualification drastic, but said it was warranted
because he had ``entangled himself to an extraordinary degree in
the activities of the Gambino crime family.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the same argument, and basing it on five of the same
tapes used to disqualify Cutler in 1991 and on others made in 1995
and 1997, prosecutors in White Plains asked Parker to remove him
from the current case.
</P>
<P>
   But Parker disagreed. ``The government's bare-bones assertion
that the evidence that Cutler served as house counsel in 1990 is
equally potent today has not been adequately supported,'' he wrote.
``In the light of the passage of time, the changed identity of the
defendants, and the disparate substantive crimes charged,'' he
said, prosecutors had not proved their argument.
</P>
<P>
   Besides allowing Cutler to continue representing Gotti, along
with Gerald Shargel, Parker rejected a government move to
disqualify Joseph Corozzo Jr. from representing Anthony Plomitallo,
saying the lawyer's videotaped presence at a casino with John A.
Gotti meant little.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge disqualified two other lawyers _ Robert Ellis
because his prior representation of another defendant might
conflict with his defense of Gregory DePalma, and Richard Rehbock
because former clients of his might be called as witnesses,
presenting him with ``a nearly impossible ethical dilemma.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said he was ``awfully disappointed.'' Rehbock insisted
that former clients would pose no conflict of interest for him
because most would not be called as witnesses, and those who might
were willing to sign waivers releasing him from obligations arising
from possibly conflicting loyalties. &QL;

LEWIS H. YOUNG, FORMER EDITOR OF BUSINESS WEEK, DEAD AT 73 
</HEADLINE>
  (th)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lewis H. Young, a former editor in chief of Business Week who
expanded the horizons of business reporting, died Friday in
Manhattan. He was 73 and lived in Ossining, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Young died of a heart attack as he was leaving his office at
Cahners Publishing Co., where he was editorial director of
Electronic News, said his wife, Joanne Root Young.
</P>
<P>
   Trained in engineering and physics, Young was among the first
business magazine editors to emphasize coverage of technology,
electronics and computers. At Business Week, he was in charge
during a period when economic news was frequently prominent,
including an Arab oil embargo, recession in the mid-1970s and the
New York City financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   He was also editor in chief of Electronics Magazine, which, like
Business Week, was a McGraw-Hill publication. He also started
several other business and electronics magazines.
</P>
<P>
   He was active with Catalyst, a national advocacy group for the
advancement of women in business and the professions, for a number
of years and became chairman of its board in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 years as chief editor, he left Business Week in 1984.
Young moved to Hong Kong and started the magazine Far East
Business. In 1989, he joined the Cahners Publishing, a unit of Reed
Elsevier PLC, the British-Dutch information company.
</P>
<P>
   He directed Asian operations of Cahners and was editorial
director of Cahners' Electronic Business Asia, based in Hong Kong.
In 1992, he became editorial director of Electronic Business, a
Cahners monthly based in Boston. He moved to Electronic News as
editorial director last year.
</P>
<P>
   Young was born in Philadelphia. He received undergraduate
degrees in mechanical engineering and physics at Purdue University.
After college, he was a physicist with the Bettis Atomic Power
division of Westinghouse Electric Corp. He earned a master's degree
in business administration from New York University. He was a first
lieutenant in the Army Corps of Engineers from 1943 to 1946.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Mrs. Anne
Albanese of Norwalk, Conn., and a sister, Pauline Schamberg of
Buffalo Grove, Ill. &QL;

PROPOSAL TIES CAR INSURANCE TO MILEAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Seizing on an issue that dominated last year's
gubernatorial race in New Jersey, Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross
released a plan Monday to lower auto insurance rates in New York,
including a proposal for pay-by-the-mile premiums.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of two proposals to lower the rates offered Monday by
candidates for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Peter
Vallone, speaker of the New York City Council, offered a more
limited proposal, but Ms. McCaughey Ross's plan would give
consumers who do little driving a choice of paying a flat rate, as
drivers do now, or paying a rate based on mileage.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies already include miles driven as one of many
factors in calculating premiums, but her plan would make the
correlation much more direct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk isn't in owning a car, it's in driving one,'' Ms.
McCaughey Ross said. ``People who drive less should not be made to
line insurance companies' pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   The mileage-based approach would be a boon to people who drive
infrequently, a group that includes elderly drivers, residents of
New York City and women. All three constituencies could be crucial
to McCaughey Ross's political fortunes; older people are more
likely to vote, she is appealing explicitly for women's votes, and
she is trying to raise her relatively low standing among New York
City voters.
</P>
<P>
   She said her proposals would lower rates 25 percent, but much of
that is based on speculative projections of savings from other
elements of her plan, like appointing a consumer advocate and
cutting administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey last year, Gov. Christie Whitman, a Republican,
was nearly beaten by a little-known Democrat, state Sen. Jim
McGreevey, who accused her of doing nothing about the state's auto
insurance premiums, the highest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross and the other Democrats who are vying for
their party's gubernatorial nomination _ Charles Hynes, the
Brooklyn district attorney; James Larocca, a former state
commissioner of both transportation and energy, and Vallone _ have
said they hope to use the issue to greater effect in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In outlining his own insurance plan, Vallone charged that one of
the reasons for New York's high rates is a law signed by Gov.
George Pataki in 1995, when Ms. McCaughey Ross was a loyal member
of the Republican governor's team. She switched party affiliation
in September and immediately started making plans for her
gubernatorial race.
</P>
<P>
   A Vallone campaign aide said that 1995 law increased drivers'
minimum coverage, which resulted in higher rates. ``Ross said
nothing when the state passed this legislation,'' said Kim Rubey, a
spokeswoman for the Vallone campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone released a less detailed proposal that called for
creating a toll-free telephone number and an Internet site to help
people comparison-shop, as well as limiting insurers' profits, and
strengthening penalties for fraud. He did not say how much his
proposal might lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki camp dismissed the proposals by Vallone and McCaughey
Ross as pandering. ``Neither one makes any sense,'' said Zenia
Mucha, the governor's communications director. ``This is nothing
more than election-year politics.''
</P>
<P>
   In a poll conducted this week by the John Zogby International
polling firm, more than half the New Yorkers surveyed said they
considered auto insurance rates a ``very important'' issue in the
race for governor, but a similar number said they did not think it
would change their decision on whether to vote for Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Even though McCaughey Ross's plan could have appeal among
important voting blocs, it has political risks, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Griffin, vice president of the American Insurance
Association, said lowering rates for one group would lead to higher
rates for others; in this case, upstate residents, who drive the
longest distances and have been McCaughey Ross's greatest source of
support.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant governor argued that since insurers were making
healthy profits now, it would be possible to lower everyone's
rates. But she conceded that when profits are slim or nonexistent,
lower rates for those who drive less will force up the rates for
those who drive more. &QL;

HEAD OF MANHATTAN SCHOOL DISTRICT GOING TO SAN DIEGO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anthony Alvarado, a former New York City schools chancellor who
resigned amid questions of financial misconduct but later earned
national distinction as the leader of an innovative Manhattan
school district, announced Monday that he would leave New York's
public schools next month to become the second-in-command of the
San Diego school system.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in San Diego, Alvarado was vague about his
reasons for leaving the New York schools. He focused instead on his
new job and new boss, saying that the San Diego schools
superintendent, Alan Bersin, was ``a superintendent with a view
toward making this the quintessential urban school system in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first year, Alvarado pledged, San Diego's test scores
will improve. ``Within a very, very short time, you will see
results,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his 11 years as superintendent of New York's District 2,
Alvarado, 56, was credited with setting into motion measures later
embraced by the rest of the city school system _ including
intensive teacher-training programs, an extended school day and the
establishment of academic standards to be to met by all students.
</P>
<P>
   With his new job, Alvarado will move from the helm of a district
of 22,000 students to the No. 2 administrator of a district of
137,000. Although friends and associates said Alvarado was
motivated by a desire to seek a new challenge, some board members
in District 2 noted that he had also sometimes been blocked in his
efforts to make changes in his district by Schools Chancellor Rudy
Crew. In addition, they cited a widely publicized rift between the
two men last year after Alvarado allowed a group of parents at a
Greenwich Village elementary school, Public School 41, to raise
money to pay the salary of a fourth-grade teacher whose job was
being eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the chancellor described Alvarado as having
violated ``administrative judgment 101'' by not seeking permission
from his office; he ultimately allowed the teacher to be hired,
with money from Alvarado's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarado ``was unhappy because he felt the chancellor was not
being responsive and making it more difficult for him,'' a member
of the District 2 board, Doug Robinson, said Monday. ``The
chancellor blamed him for the P.S. 41 issue, which was ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   But at his news conference Monday, Alvarado said the Public
School 41 debate had nothing to do with his departure. ``We expect
disagreements about decisions,'' he said. ``But disagreements do
not a spat make.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the rifts between the two men over Public School 41,
the chancellor's spokeswoman, Chiara Coletti, said: ``I can't
imagine that would make Tony retire. He is a very large figure in
the school system.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Alvarado, District 2's results on standardized tests
improved steadily; the district, which sprawls from working-class
immigrant neighborhoods in Chinatown to the Upper East Side, now
ranks second in the city in reading and math scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so saddened,'' said Karen Feuer, president of Community
School Board 2. ``He is a visionary. For the last 11 years he has
really achieved institutionalized reform within the confines of
this bureaucratic system. He's been able to build a culture that
everybody is a lifelong learner.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the attention he received as superintendent in
District 2, Alvarado will also be remembered for his brief tenure
as schools chancellor from 1983 to 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarado was accused of violating ethical standards by promoting
or awarding overtime to employees who lent him money and of
submitting false information on mortgage applications. He resigned
several days before he was to face a disciplinary hearing on
charges of professional misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation by Elizabeth Holtzman, then the Brooklyn
district attorney, later found no evidence to warrant prosecution.
But Ms. Holtzman said Alvarado had agreed to pay the board $569.32
as ``restitution'' for improperly using board employees to paint
his home and baby-sit for his children during hours in which the
employees were being paid by the board.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Bersin said Alvarado had made ``an enormous misjudgment
and an ethical lapse but he was held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is here,'' Bersin added, ``because he is a world-class
educator.''

SPORTS COLUMN: SHHH! CAN'T YOU SEE THE CELEBRATION? 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Thou shalt be silent when the celebrating begins,'' is a
commandment for broadcasters calling title games. The pictures tell
the story, so shut up. Don't narrate the hugs. There will be lots
of time to talk later.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, NBC's Bob Costas violated the rule on Sunday night
during the exultant moments after the Chicago Bulls defeated the
Utah Jazz in Game 6 to win the National Basketball Association
title.
</P>
<P>
   After saying what needed to be said _ ``The Chicago Bulls have
won their sixth NBA championship, and it's their second
three-peat'' _ Costas clammed up for seven seconds, then began
talking again. Costas spoke for 69 of the next 80 seconds. Most of
what he said offered insight or perspective. And, yes, the Bulls'
achievements, particularly Michael Jordan's, merit a doctoral
thesis.
</P>
<P>
   But all of Costas' words could have waited for two minutes'
worth of self-explanatory video imagery to run its course.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, a randomly chosen tape of a previous Bulls
championship showed Marv Albert staying absolutely quiet for 2
minutes 19 seconds as Chicago celebrated winning the 1992 title
over the Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   We expect much from Costas, a peerless studio host and
inquisitor. His recent ``Dateline NBC'' profile of Art Schlichter,
the onetime quarterback whose compulsive gambling landed him in
prison, was riveting.
</P>
<P>
   But Costas is not Albert. His voice doesn't match the rhythms of
basketball as faithfully as Albert's did. Yes, Costas is prepared.
He rarely makes mistakes. Yet his style seems more suited to
baseball, more in tune with its pace.
</P>
<P>
   When he was called upon to replace Albert, Costas hadn't called
basketball in nearly 20 years. Albert achieved his mastery over
more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's post-Albert team was ever in flux: Costas had to readjust
to hoops, nurture Isiah Thomas through on-the-job training and then
bring the far more experienced Doug Collins into the mix. They
improved, but not to the level Albert achieved with his partners.
Only Collins is a No. 1 basketball voice.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Collins was usually sharp as Costas invited him to
coach the game as it advanced. Collins gained primacy over Thomas
as the No. 1 analyst, a title NBC bestowed on him despite his lack
of experience. But would you turn down $750,000 a year simply
because you were a great player?
</P>
<P>
   As always, the choice of announcer made no difference in the
ratings. The Teletubbies could call the NBA finals, especially one
starring Jordan, and ratings would soar. In fact, these finals will
be the highest rated ever.
</P>
<P>
   Such viewership makes players virtual pals. If Jordan rang your
doorbell asking for cheese for his nachos, you'd call him
``Michael,'' wouldn't you? If Scottie Pippen popped over for a
chiropractic adjustment, you'd call him ``Scottie,'' right? If Karl
Malone stopped by for an emergency swabbing of Rogaine, you'd say,
``Karl, take my last drop of Rogaine, because keeping your bald
spot filled is critical to the NBA's post-Jordan future.'' Right?
</P>
<P>
   But some players were addressed more familiarly by Costas than
others, as if they moonlighted as Brazilian soccer stars. Bob
called Jordan ``Jordan'' 53 times, ``Michael'' 21 times, ``M.J.''
twice and ``Michael Jordan'' 11 times. Pippen was ``Pippen'' 23
times, ``Scottie Pippen'' six times and ``Scottie'' seven times
(confusing some who believed Scottie Burrell made the plays). Bulls
Coach Phil Jackson was ``Phil'' twice. Luc Longley got a ``Luc'' or
two.
</P>
<P>
   But Utah's stars were not on such a first-name basis. Not once
did Bob call John Stockton ``John.'' (He was the only John on the
floor.) Malone was ``Malone'' 48 times and ``Karl Malone'' six
times. Bob waited until 5 minutes 45 seconds remained in the game
to call Malone ``Karl,'' then let it slip once more. &QL;

ERIC TABARLY, 66, FRENCH SAILOR KNOWN FOR HIS SOLO EXPLOITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eric Tabarly, the robust Frenchman known as the ``iron man'' for
his daring and clever efforts at sailing across oceans
single-handedly, was lost at sea late last Friday after falling
overboard from his century-old sailboat, Pen Duick, near the coast
of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   A national hero from the time he won his first trans-Atlantic
race in 1964, Tabarly was declared dead Sunday by officials in
Brest, France, a city in the Brittany region where he was born. He
was 66.
</P>
<P>
   An extensive sea and air search failed to turn up any sign of
the missing yachtsman over the weekend. ``Despite the last searches
that seemed in vain, I didn't dare believe the demise of Eric
Tabarly,'' French President Jacques Chirac said Monday. ``It is
with great sadness and much emotion that I give in to the
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Tabarly reportedly was not wearing a life jacket or carrying any
kind of radio transmitter when he fell into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   According to accounts from four friends who were sailing with
him as crew, Tabarly was knocked off his sailboat when its gaff rig
hit him as the boat lurched. He was directing them at the time in
lowering the mainsail and raising a storm jib as winds increased
during their journey to Scotland. The crew threw Tabarly a life
jacket, but said they were unable to see him in the dark. The team
lowered the 50-foot yacht's sails, then turned on the boat's engine
to look for Tabarly.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his sailing career, Tabarly kindled a French
appreciation for adventure by his solo exploits. His second
sailboat, the 44-foot ketch Pen Duick II, was well thought out for
the job at hand: finishing the 1964 Observer Single-Handed
Trans-Atlantic Race first _ in 27 days, a full two days ahead of
Tabarly's British rival, Sir Francis Chichester.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Tabarly came back to win that race again, the second
time in Pen Duick VI, a 73-foot maxi-yacht that completed the
3,300-mile voyage in 23 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was this square-jawed, muscular, very fit sailor who always
had a swarm around him of fans and media,'' said Tony Lush, of
Jamestown, R.I., a fellow solo sailor who competed against Tabarly
that year. ``There was always a buzz around him, like drones around
a queen bee, but he was always just tending to his task at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystique continued with victories in European races as well
as a solo trans-Pacific crossing in 1969. Tabarly set a new
trans-Atlantic record in 1980, a crossing from New York to England
in 10 days 5 hours on the futuristic, 60-foot hydrofoil, Paul
Ricard.
</P>
<P>
   Tabarly is survived by his wife, Jacqueline, and his 14-year-old
daughter, Marie. &QL;

 By JOYCE WADLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Folks attending the Sotheby's collectors' auction on
Saturday, encountering a poem written by 11-year-old Elvis Presley
to a grammar-school mate (it sold for $5,500) or Ella Fitzgerald's
``Personal and Professional Card Collection'' (including Diners
Club and Screen Actors Guild, it brought $600) may have wondered if
there is anything in America that is not for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Yes _ at least at this auction house.
</P>
<P>
   The car in which President John F. Kennedy was assassinated,
which was offered some years ago, was refused by Dana Hawkes, vice
president for collectibles, as were items from the Sharon Tate
murder scene and Nazi memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hawkes is also not disappointed that a tape recording of
Elvis Presley's last concert, for which there were copyright
concerns, was not offered for sale by Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a very sad, very sad tape,'' says Ms. Hawkes, who
is 42 and is clearly fond of some of the people whose possessions
she is selling. ``He was obviously high as a kite, he couldn't
remember the words to the songs. It was just a very sad
representation of the King that everybody remembers.''
</P>
<P>
   But do you have the Action comic in which Superman made his
first appearance, or a signed script from the last ``Seinfeld''
episode or something that really used to belong to Sinatra? The
enthusiastic Ms. Hawkes, uncharacteristic in her field because she
tries not to be too pushy in the acquisition of stuff, would like
to speak with you.
</P>
<P>
   Collectibles, which at Sotheby's include dolls, toys and
memorabilia, are Ms. Hawkes' field, and she is particularly well
versed in Hollywood and rock 'n' roll. She can tell you if your
John Lennon autograph is fake (Yoko Ono helps her) or what to do
with your Princess of Wales dolls from the Franklin Mint (take them
elsewhere).
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Hawkes says this courteously, and tells callers where
they might sell their dolls. Ms. Hawkes, after all, does not simply
cater to the pop-objet obsessed; she is one of them. Driving to the
Midwest with her husband and two young sons last Christmas, she had
the family dine on Burger King all the way to get the Nightmare
Before Christmas wristwatches they were giving away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farther away we got from New York City, the more they let
us buy Nightmare Before Christmas watches without buying the
burgers,'' says Ms. Hawkes, whose work forces her to be a student
of society. ``We bought 50. Now, six months later, they're each
worth $25. We were really sick of burgers. OK, so I do collect.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes a successful purveyor of other people's possessions?
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Ms. Hawkes, a cheerful yet respectful obsession.
Raised in Boston, Ms. Hawkes majored in art history at Swarthmore.
She went to work for Sotheby's in 1984, when collectibles brought
in $800,000 annually to the New York house. Now, Ms. Hawkes says,
the field brings in $6 million to $8 million a year. And while she
credits the increase to nostalgic baby boomers who have reached the
age of disposable income, others say Ms. Hawkes has also helped
nurture the market.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hawkes convinced Sotheby's to go into the vintage comic
books field, which took in $900,000 in the most recent sale. (She
also married Jerry Weist, the antique-comic-book appraiser and
artist who brought the idea to her.)
</P>
<P>
   She has been involved in the Andy Warhol estate, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every department in the company was involved in that except
Judaica,'' Ms. Hawkes says modestly. ``He was a Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   How do auctioneers get their hands on the goods?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody always says there are the three D's in the auction
trade,'' Ms. Hawkes says. ``Death, divorce, debt.''
</P>
<P>
   The one item Ms. Hawkes would have liked to keep?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a Clark Gable script for `Gone With the Wind,' bound in
leather, with Clark Gable's name in gold letters on the cover, ''
Ms. Hawkes says. ``It came to us from a woman who had been a
secretary at the studio, who had had a relationship with Gable.
Normally an unannotated script with no date would not be worth that
much; because it was Gable we thought it might bring $3,000 to
$4,000, but because of the romantic connection a lot of people were
interested. It went for $77,000 to a man from the Midwest who
wanted to give it to his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   How long ago was this?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hawkes searches for a signpost in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '88,'' she says. ``We had the witch hat from `The Wizard of
Oz' and the white piano from `Casablanca' in the same sale. I asked
the woman why she was selling and she said she had reached an age
when she was disposing of some things. Often, it's economics. Or
people feel they have to let go and they'd rather do it when they
are of mind and can handle their affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it must be a sad thing to sell a gift from a love affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Ms. Hawkes says. ``From what I see, it's
the period of indecisiveness that's the difficult period. By the
time they've decided to sell, what I hear from people over and over
is, `It's time.' Time to divest of things. Like elderly people who
lose a spouse and say, `It's time.' Six months later, they're
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary who loved Clark Gable?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Ms. Hawkes said. ``She lived in Los Angeles.
And as I said, she was quite old.'' &QL;

STATES LOBBYING FOR BATTLESHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To devotees of naval history, America's great
battleships are proud symbols of an era when hulking vessels could
unnerve the most belligerent of enemies simply by bellying up to
their coastlines, when global power was won at sea and diplomacy
rested on the shoulders of admirals.
</P>
<P>
   Those times may be gone, but the aura of power that still
surrounds the huge Iowa-class battleships that helped win the
Pacific war 50 years ago has placed them at the center of a new
conflict: a nationwide competition among states that see the ships
as potential gold mines for tourist dollars.
</P>
<P>
   With the Navy preparing to give away at least one of its three
Iowa-class battleships to make way for higher-technology weapons
and ships, a dozen states, including New Jersey, have begun
aggressive lobbying campaigns in Washington to acquire one of the
45,000-ton armor-plated behemoths. The states are hoping to convert
the ships into naval museums like the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum
in New York, one of nine such big ship museums in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The battleship competition has led to the kind of fierce
back-room wheeling and dealing that only Washington can produce,
and for the moment, New Jersey seems to be outflanking its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming weeks, the Senate is expected to pass legislation
pushed by New Jersey's Democratic senators, Frank Lautenberg and
Robert Torricelli, that would order the Navy to make the U.S.S. New
Jersey available for donation. Since a nonprofit group from New
Jersey is the leading applicant for the ship, Senate and Navy
officials say, the measure would virtually insure that the vessel
goes to the state.
</P>
<P>
   The House has already passed similar legislation. But a group in
San Francisco has joined forces with a naval veterans' organization
to bring another of the ships, the Iowa, to a pier near the Oakland
Bay Bridge, where they would convert it into a museum and part-time
emergency medical center during earthquakes. California's
Democratic senators, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, have said
that they may try to block the New Jersey legislation and
substitute a measure that would make the Iowa available for
donation instead of the New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, the Navy can give away only one of the
Iowa-class ships and must keep the other two available for military
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a do or die effort for us,'' said Merylin Wong, the
head of the California group, called the Historic Ships Memorial at
Pacific Square in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The competitive fever has also spread to New Jersey, where
anticipation of victory on Capitol Hill has prompted an intense
rivalry among three cities to become home to the water-bound
museum.
</P>
<P>
   Camden wants the battleship for its redeveloped Delaware River
waterfront, while Bayonne sees it as the anchor for new commercial
development at a recently closed Navy base. But Jersey City asserts
it has the most scenic spot of all: Liberty State Park, with its
unbroken views of lower Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who was secretary of the Navy from 1972
to 1974 and is now chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Seapower,
supported inserting the New Jersey provision into a Defense
Department financing bill because, he said, the Iowa is in better
condition than the New Jersey and so should stay in the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the fight are the fastest, largest and deadliest
battleships ever built in America, stretching about three footballs
fields long, 887 feet, carrying crews of more than 1,500 and able
to reach speeds greater than 33 knots.
</P>
<P>
   But the hallmark of the ships is their 16-inch guns, capable of
raining 1,900-pound shells on targets 23 miles away, though not
with pinpoint accuracy. No matter: The blast impact of shells that
weigh as much as small pachyderms means close is good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Marine Corps officials have been the staunchest
advocates of keeping all the Iowa-class battleships in the Navy.
``The Navy has poured millions into finding a substitute for the
battleships, but they have nothing that compares,'' said James
Soper, a retired Marine Corps brigadier general. ``There is a
certain element of the Navy that says, `If it isn't brand-new, it
can't be good.'''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioned in 1943, the New Jersey is the only one of the four
Iowa-class ships to have served in four conflicts: World War II,
where she participated in the assault on Iwo Jima and was a
flagship for Adm. William Halsey Jr.; Korea; Vietnam, and, in 1983,
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The ship was decommissioned in 1991 and is docked in Bremerton,
Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The other ships of its class are the Iowa, Wisconsin and
Missouri. The Missouri, on whose deck the Japanese surrendered, is
on its way to Hawaii to become a museum at Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Wisconsin remains on the Navy's active register,
Warner is pushing legislation to move it to a public dock in
Norfolk, Va., where tourists would be allowed to inspect its top
deck.
</P>
<P>
   If New Jersey gets the New Jersey, it will be the culmination of
a two-decade campaign by the Battleship New Jersey Foundation, a
nonprofit organization formed in 1979 when the Navy first flirted
with the idea of giving the ship away. (Instead, it was
recommissioned to help the Marines in Lebanon.)
</P>
<P>
   The group has raised $3 million, partly through the sale of
special license plates, partly through a program that allows
residents to contribute part of their tax refunds to the commission
and partly through donations.
</P>
<P>
   The group estimates it will need more than $1 million just to
tow the ship from Washington to New Jersey, a two-month process; $3
million to prepare it for tourists, and $3 million a year for
maintenance and administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
   But the foundation's chairman, State Assemblyman Joseph
Azzolina, 72, sees success on the horizon. ``We should have it by
this time next year,'' he said, casting a euphoric look across the
Bayonne pier into the steely gray waters of New York Harbor.

   CONNUBIAL BLISS
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ethan Hawke was playing the part of the solicitous
husband when he and Uma Thurman, his wife of six weeks who is seven
months pregnant, arrived for a workout at a Greenwich Village gym
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was making a big deal about getting her set up on the
treadmill,'' said another member of the New York Sports Club who
was exercising nearby. ``Then she started on the treadmill, and he
was running around trying to get two treadmills together. While he
was gone, she stumbled and almost fell.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he was back, there was the matter of how fast she was
exercising. ``She was just walking on the treadmill,'' the man
said, ``and at one point she started to jog a bit, and he got
concerned and said something like, `Be careful, you don't want to
go too hard.' She said, `I didn't turn the speed up, but walking so
fast was hurting my legs.' He said, `It's easier to go a long way
at a slower speed, and there are not many women in here who are
carrying a baby, so you're not competing with anybody.' And she
wore her sunglasses the whole time, which if you're trying not to
attract attention is not the way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is having a husband who sounds as if he is trying to justify
his decision to marry. ``He was saying that he was talking to a
friend of his about getting married and the friend got upset and
said, `Why would you do that? No reason to,''' the man said. But
Hawke told Miss Thurman that he had replied that while marriage is
not for everybody, it is right for some people.

   THE QUEEN MOTHER SETS A RECORD
</P>
<P>
   It took her 97 years and 315 days, but Queen Elizabeth the queen
mother has finally clinched a place in British history. On Sunday,
she became the oldest royal ever.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of Queen Elizabeth II and the widow of King George
VI, she passed the record held by Queen Victoria's granddaughter,
Princess Alice, who died on Jan. 3, 1981. The queen mother will
celebrate her 98th birthday on Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to say it categorically, but I cannot find any
British royal from our records who has lived longer than the queen
mother,'' Harold Brooks-Baker, director of Burke's Peerage, told
The Express in London.

   JUST ANOTHER FACE IN THE CROWD
</P>
<P>
   Millions of television viewers could probably pick Matt Lauer
out of a lineup of hosts, but at Nick and Toni's, a restaurant in
East Hampton, N.Y., he's just another customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hostess called him Eric instead of Matt,'' said a man who
works for the restaurant, ``and took him to the wrong table.''
</P>
<P>
   The table the hostess was heading toward had not been set, so
she turned and led Lauer and his fiancee, Annette Roque, to the
table they were supposed to have had all along, right next to one
occupied by Jellybean Benitez, the record producer who has worked
with Madonna, Sting, Whitney Houston and such Latin artists as
Ruben Blades.

   TARANTINO LAWYER REBUTS ACCUSATION
</P>
<P>
   A postscript on Quentin Tarantino, who was arrested last week on
a charge of assaulting Leila Mwangi, a customer in an East Village
restaurant last month: Tarantino's lawyer, Paul F. Callan, is
denying the charge, calling it ``a form of celebrity stalking of
the worst kind'' and accusing Ms. Mwangi of pressing it ``to
buttress her allegations'' in a $15 million civil suit she is
filing against Tarantino (which Callan called ``equally
meritless''). Callan is also disputing the police account of the
incident. ``Ms. Mwangi was not involved in any discussions with Mr.
Tarantino about the portrayal of black people in his films,''
Callan said. ``Mr. Tarantino had prior to the incident criticized
racism in Hollywood in the making of various casting decisions.'' &QL;

ORIOLES BEAT YANKEES, 7-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The Yankees insisted that the bad blood with the
Baltimore Orioles no longer existed, that they had no intention of
retaliating for the incident last month in which the Orioles'
Armando Benitez hit Tino Martinez with a pitch, triggering a brawl
and suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's home plate umpire, John Hirschbeck, did not
believe any of it. After Mike Stanton allowed a seventh-inning home
run to Baltimore's Rafael Palmeiro, Stanton threw a fastball into
the back of Eric Davis, the Orioles' next batter. Hirschbeck
immediately ejected Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees went on to lose, 7-4, in a game marked by Ricky
Ledee's first major league home run and interrupted for 27 minutes
by rain. But the outcome has little chance of affecting the
American League East race, for the Orioles are 22 games behind the
first-place Yankees in the loss column. It could be, though, that
the Yankees have evened a month-old score.
</P>
<P>
   After being ejected, Stanton reacted as if he had no intention
of hitting Davis, shrugging as if to way, ``Who, me?'' Intentional
or not, the coincidences were plentiful. Like Benitez on May 19,
Stanton had allowed an important home run. Like Benitez, Stanton
hit the next batter with his next pitch. Like Martinez, Davis wears
No. 24. Like Benitez, Stanton threw a fastball. Like Benitez,
Stanton planted his fastball between the 2 and the 4.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions will linger and the bad blood will simmer when the
Yankees play the second game of this three-game series on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles and the Yankees were tied in the bottom of the sixth
inning, 4-4, when B.J. Surhoff singled and took second on a
groundout. Lenny Webster, Baltimore's light-hitting catcher, took a
hard swing and lofted a high fly toward left.
</P>
<P>
   The dimensions in Camden Yards are notoriously short, 364 feet
to left-center, and Ledee, playing deep in left field, stepped
back. A second or two passed before Ledee realized he had badly
misjudged the ball and it was falling in front of him. By the time
he recovered, it was too late. Surhoff took third, Webster stopped
at first and David Wells, the Yankee starter, jerked his shoulders
in some frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bordick then lifted another fly to left. Surhoff moved back
to third to tag up, and Ledee measured the fly, backing up and
moving forward as he caught the ball. Ledee's throw beat Surhoff to
the plate, but in fielding the hop, the Yankees' catcher, Jorge
Posada, had drawn his right foot back, leaving half of the plate
uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Through this open door to home did Surhoff slide _ safely,
according to Hirschbeck. The Yankees argued, but they trailed
nevertheless, by 5-4, and caught the Orioles nevermore.
</P>
<P>
   Thick, dark clouds that haunted Camden Yards all day burst about
two hours before the game and did little to stem the 83-degree
heat; rather, the humidity hung in the air, and on the pitchers,
riding their shoulders like weighted backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   Wells has pitched his best games this year in cool temperatures
_ his perfect game in 59 degrees _ and his worst game occurred on a
steamy night in Texas. Two innings into Monday night's game, creeks
of sweat flowed down his face, and Wells seemed to be laboring.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a former Toronto teammate, Joe Carter, in the first
inning, Wells went inside with a fastball _ and Carter turned on
it, whacking a line drive off the foul pole down the left-field
line. It was the 18th home run allowed by Wells, who has walked
only 17 batters.
</P>
<P>
   Webster opened the third with a single and moved to second on a
sacrifice bunt. Webster failed to tag up and take third, however,
after Roberto Alomar flied out to deep right-center. But with two
out, Carter squibbed a roller down the third-base line for a cheap
single that scored Webster. Harold Baines followed with a single
and Palmeiro laced a run-scoring double to make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry singled with one out in the Yankee fourth, and
Posada followed with a single to left. Ledee came to the plate,
having been wiped out by Baltimore's Scott Erickson in his first
at-bat _ two fastballs and a wicked slider, a three-pitch
strikeout. In this at-bat, Ledee fell behind 0-2 again, on
fastballs. Erickson tried a fastball, and Ledee fouled it off.
</P>
<P>
   Then Erickson missed with his next three pitches. Ledee, playing
his second game in the big leagues, then fouled off a fastball.
Erickson came back with another fastball, on the outside part of
the plate, and Ledee reached out and lifted it over the wall in
left field, the opposite way. Three batters, three runs, tie game.
</P>
<P>
   Wells retired the first two hitters in the fifth, but Carter
pulled a double down the left-field line. Baines singled again and
Carter scored, giving Baltimore a 4-3 lead. With one out in the
Yankees' sixth, however, Posada launched a homer into the stands in
right-center field, tying the score one more time.
