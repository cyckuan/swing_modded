<HEADLINE> Report: Nuggets, Aves Sale Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A tentative deal has been reached to sell the  
Denver Nuggets, the Colorado Avalanche and the Pepsi Center to a 
group headed by a man whose wife is heir to the Wal-Mart Corp. 
fortune, a newspaper reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams and the $170 million arena, which is under  
construction, are owned by a subsidiary of Ascent Entertainment 
Group and worth at least $400 million, the Denver Post said, 
quoting unidentified NBA sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The group seeking the teams is headed by Bill Laurie, a former  
basketball player for Memphis State. He and his wife, Nancy Walton, 
own Crown Center Farms in Columbia, Mo., which raises quarter 
horses and Appaloosas. 
</P>
<P>
	Walton's late father, James L. ``Bud'' Walton, and his brother,  
Sam, co-founded the Wal-Mart chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Lyons, Ascent's chief executive officer, declined  
comment through a spokesman on Tuesday. Laurie also declined 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The possible sale of the two teams has been rumored for about a  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, KMGH-TV said Ascent executives were discussing a  
possible sale with Wal-Mart officials. Lyons called that report 
inaccurate and Wal-Mart executives denied corporate involvement in 
any talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wouldn't surprise me and the other large shareholders that  
something would happen as soon as technically possible,'' said Jeff 
Berg, president of Matador Capital Management Corp., which owns 6 
percent of Ascent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver-based Ascent, spun off by Comsat Corp. in mid-1997,  
sold its majority interest in Beacon Communications, a movie 
production unit, in January. It also owns a 57 percent stake in On 
Command, a hotel video-on-demand service. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported a net loss of $45.8 million, or $1.54 a  
share, in 1998, compared with a net loss of $43.4 million, or $1.47 
a share in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Ascent's foray into professional sports began in the early 1990s  
when, as COMSAT Video Enterprises, it spent $17 million for a 
majority interest in the Nuggets. In 1995, it paid $65 million for 
the Avalanche.

<HEADLINE> Source: Francis To Declare for NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Steve Francis, a second-team All-America and one  
of college basketball's most exciting players, will leave Maryland 
after just one season and declare for the NBA draft, The Associated 
Press learned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources close to the situation said the 6-foot-3 Francis would  
announce his decision Wednesday. Maryland has called a news 
conference for Wednesday at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis averaged 17 points for the Terrapins (28-6), who were  
ranked as high as No. 2 this season but lost to St. John's in the 
NCAA tournament regional semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland coach Gary Williams had indicated Saturday that he  
would meet with Francis on Monday to discuss the junior college 
transfer's future. Francis had said previously he would return for 
his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Takoma Park, Md., Francis burst onto the national  
scene right from the start as he became a daily fixture on the 
highlight reels with his spectacular open-court moves and dunks. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland lost starters Obinna Ekezie, Terrell Stokes and Laron  
Profit to graduation, leaving Terence Morris as the only returning 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Junior forward Albert White of Missouri has already announced  
his decision to leave school early. Among those still being 
speculated about are Duke's Elton Brand, the national player of the 
year, and William Avery; Connecticut's Richard Hamilton, the Most 
Outstanding Player in the Final Four, and Khalid El-Amin; Ron 
Artest of St. John's; Baron Davis of UCLA; Jumaine Jones of 
Georgia; Chris Porter of Auburn; and Mateen Cleaves of Michigan 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	Two junior point guards, Ed Cota of North Carolina and Scoonie  
Penn of Ohio State, have announced they will return next season.

<HEADLINE> Angels Deal With Injury, Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Gary DiSarcina's injured left forearm is  
injured more severely than first thought, and the Anaheim Angels 
shortstop will need surgery and miss 3-to-4 months of the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	DiSarcina, an outstanding fielder who hit .287 with three homers  
and 56 RBIs in 157 games last season, was struck by a fungo bat 
during batting practice on Feb. 21. The original prognosis was he 
would return in 4-to-6 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	A CT scan Monday showed the bone has not completely healed.  
DiSarcina, 31, will have a plate screwed into the ulna bone to 
allow for proper healing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly a setback in the way we viewed our team at the  
outset of spring training,'' Angels vice president Tim Mead said. 
``We'll make things work out. Truly, it's a very resilient, gritty 
team. Knowing Gary's coming back is something we will all look 
forward to, but there's a lot of work to do before that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels acquired utility infielder Andy Sheets from San Diego  
on Monday as a possible replacement for DiSarcina. Sheets hit .242 
with seven homers and 29 RBIs for the Padres last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim also made a trade Tuesday, sending switch-hitting  
infielder Dave Hollins to the Toronto Blue Jays for minor league 
infielder Tomas Perez. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels also released infielder Andy Stankiewicz and  
right-handed reliever Rich DeLucia. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade of Hollins means Troy Glaus will be the team's third  
baseman. It had been thought Glaus might play shortstop until 
DiSarcina returned, but that was when it was believed DiSarcina 
would be back much sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	Glaus, 22, was the third overall pick in the 1997 amateur draft.  
He played in 48 games for the Angels last season, hitting .218 with 
one homer and 23 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollins, 32, hit .242 with 11 homers and 39 RBIs in 101 games  
with the Angels last season. In 940 big league games, Hollins has a 
.262 batting average with 110 homers and 476 RBIs. He previously 
played with Philadelphia, Boston, Minnesota and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe Troy Glaus is ready to be a successful third  
baseman on the big-league level, and we wanted to afford Dave the 
opportunity to play every day somewhere,'' Mead said. ``It's a good 
opportunity for Dave, he returns to a manager in Jim Fregosi who he 
played for when the Phillies went to the World Series. One thing 
Dave Hollins brought and taught this team and several players was 
intensity and how to play the game right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, 25, hit .252 with three homers and 37 RBIs in 116 games  
for Triple-A Syracuse last season. He will have his contract 
transferred from Syracuse to Edmonton, Anaheim's Triple-A 
affiliate, and report to the Angels' minor league camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Stankiewicz, 34, hit .243 in 17 games for the Angels this  
spring. Stankiewicz, who played for the Arizona Diamondbacks last 
season, signed a minor league contract on Jan. 25 that would have 
paid him $280,000 if he made the major league roster. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLucia, 33, was 2-6 with a .427 ERA and three saves in 61 games  
for the Angels last year -- all in relief. After being traded to 
Anaheim by San Francisco in 1997, he was 6-4 with a 3.61 ERA and 
three saves in 33 relief appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Because he pitched regularly last season and wasn't injured,  
DeLucia's $700,000 salary was guaranteed.

<HEADLINE> Rinault Adds to Stake in Gucci </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French retail group Pinault-Printemps-Redoute SA  
has increased its stake in the Gucci Group NV to 44.03 percent from 
about 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	French billionaire Francois Pinault's move was likely to  
represent a further blow to Bernard Arnault, head of LVMH Moet 
Hennessy Louis Vuitton, who has a 34 percent stake and wants to 
take over Gucci. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinault-Printemps-Redoute said it boosted its stake in Gucci  
through share purchases on the Amsterdam and New York stock 
markets, where Gucci is listed. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers at the New York law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and  
Katz, who are representing the retail group, said the stake 
increase did not violate a deal between the company and Gucci, 
under which the French firm agreed to cap its shareholding in Gucci 
at 42 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Once stock options that Gucci has granted to its executives have  
been exercised, Pinault's stake will fall back to below 42 percent, 
the lawyers and Pinault executives said.

<HEADLINE> Starr Witness Steele Will Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The judge in Susan McDougal's criminal  
contempt trial decided Tuesday to permit testimony from a Virginia 
woman who says Kenneth Starr prosecuted her because she undercut 
the testimony of a presidential accuser. 
</P>
<P>
	With McDougal lawyer Mark Geragos arguing that there are  
striking similarities between the two cases, U.S. District Judge 
George Howard said Julie Hiatt Steele will be allowed to testify 
Friday about her alleged mistreatment at the hands of Starr's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what they do if you don't sing their song,'' Geragos  
said of Starr's prosecution of Ms. Steele. Ms. Steele's testimony 
about her problems with Starr's office is ``the perfect cap,'' 
Geragos added. The McDougal trial is in its fourth week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been on the defensive ... but this is definitely  
something of a different level,'' prosecutor Mark Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal says that Starr is pursuing her because she won't  
give false testimony that implicates the president and first lady 
in wrongdoing in the Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele faces a May 3 trial in Alexandria, Va., charged by  
Starr's office with three counts of obstruction of justice and one 
count of making false statements in the probe involving the 
president and Kathleen Willey, a former White House volunteer. Mrs. 
Willey alleges Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance in 1993. Ms. 
Steele says she was asked by Mrs. Willey to tell a lie that 
supported the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want the jury to get the impression that she's some  
lone voice in the wilderness,'' Geragos said of Mrs. McDougal. 
``It's the only way she can prove that these fears were legitimate. 
We're trying to get the truth out to this jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over vehement objections by Starr's prosecutors, the judge in  
the McDougal case said Ms. Steele can give ``limited testimony'' 
and that Geragos ``is simply presenting this to the jury to show 
modus operandi'' by Starr's prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos argued that Ms. Steele is ``the logical extension'' of  
Mrs. McDougal. Saying she feared being indicted for perjury, Mrs. 
McDougal refused to give grand jury testimony in Starr's probe of 
the Clintons in 1996 and again in 1998 and is now charged with 
criminal contempt and obstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	After the ruling, Barrett told the judge ``this is mammoth'' and  
asked that the trial be recessed until Monday so that he could 
familiarize himself with Starr's case against Ms. Steele. The judge 
refused, delaying Ms. Steele's appearance until Friday but saying 
the case will continue in the meantime with other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Before ruling, Howard heard directly from Ms. Steele, who filed  
an affidavit in federal court at the request of a Clinton lawyer 
stating that she was asked by Mrs. Willey in 1997 to lie about an 
alleged sexual advance by the president. Ms. Steele said she had 
never heard about the allegation before that time. 
</P>
<P>
	But Starr's office says Mrs. Willey told Ms. Steele about the  
alleged sexual advance shortly after it happened in 1993 and that 
Ms. Steele related information about Mrs. Willey's account of the 
incident to several friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Mrs. McDougal said ``no'' when asked whether she  
ever had sex with Clinton. She testified last week that her 
ex-husband, Jim McDougal, pressured her to tell Starr's office in 
1996 that she'd had an affair with Clinton in a bid to get leniency 
for herself.

<HEADLINE> Jury Selected at Taiwan Execs Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (AP) -- A jury was selected Tuesday at the trial  
of two Taiwanese executives accused of stealing trade secrets from 
American adhesive maker Avery Dennison Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Pin Yen Yang, 72, president of rival Four Pillars Co. Ltd. of  
Taiwan, and his 40-year-old daughter, Hwei Chen ``Sally'' Yang, are 
on trial in U.S. District Court in Youngstown, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yangs are accused of taking secrets that could be used for  
labels and tape from Avery Dennison by paying off one of the 
company's researchers in Ohio. Prosecutors say the Yangs paid about 
$150,000 to the researcher from 1989 to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yangs each are charged with economic espionage, conspiracy,  
mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering and receipt of stolen 
goods. They have pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department says this is the first economic  
espionage case to go to trial since President Clinton in 1996 
approved a law outlawing the theft of trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening statements are scheduled for Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Some Bottled Water Said Not Pure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An environmental group petitioned the Food and  
Drug Administration on Tuesday to tighten its regulation of bottled 
water after tests showed a third of 103 brands exceeded industry or 
state purity standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy  
group, said most bottled water was found to be of good quality and 
that none of the test samples posed a health concern for the 
general public. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most bottled water appears to be safe,'' the group said.  
</P>
<P>
	But the tests on nearly 1,000 samples involving 103 brands of  
bottled water raise questions about industry-wide marketing claims 
that bottled water is more pure and healthier than tap water, the 
group maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	It said 22 percent of the samples exceeded California's  
health-based standard, the country's most stringent, for arsenic 
and cancer-causing synthetic organic compounds. Levels of bacteria 
in 17 percent of the samples exceeded the voluntary industry 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA, although not commenting on specifics of the NRDC  
report, said ``bottled water poses no significant public health 
risk and is, therefore, safe to consume.'' The agency regulates 
bottled water as a food product. Industry spokesmen also insisted 
the NRDC report itself shows most bottled water as safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans drink an estimated 3.4 billion gallons of bottled  
water annually -- about 12.7 gallons per person -- and the numbers 
have been increasing nearly 10 percent a year, according to the 
industry. It's sold as mineral water, spring water or distilled 
water, or just plain tap water that has gone through additional 
filtration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because water comes from a bottle doesn't mean it's any  
cleaner or safer than what comes from the tap,'' said Eric Olson, 
an author of the NRDC report. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Bottled Water Association said the NRDC report  
acknowledges that most of the water tested was ``of good quality'' 
and contained no detectable bacteria or chemicals that posed a 
health concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bottle water is extremely safe. There have been no confirmed  
reports of any illness or disease linked to bottled water in the 37 
years that the FDA has regulated the product,'' said Cindy 
Yablonski, the association's vice president for research. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Jeffery, president of Perrier Group of North America, the  
country's biggest bottled water company, said that NRDC cited 
finding a bacteria, HPC, in many of the samples. HPC is found in 
yogurt, milk and cheese and ``is totally natural'' and not 
regulated, said Jeffery. 
</P>
<P>
	But the NRDC report's authors said the FDA's regulations are too  
weak and cover only about 30 to 40 percent of bottled water sold. 
The FDA rules do not apply to carbonated water or bottled water 
sold within a single state. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRDC petition asks the FDA to set strict limits, equivalent  
to those in California, or the federal standards for tap water, for 
a wide variety of contaminants including chlorine, arsenic, 
bacteria and both organic and inorganic chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	It also calls on the FDA to apply its rules to all bottled water  
distributed, even if sold only within a single state, issue 
stronger labeling requirements that disclose contaminants, and 
require that state bottled water programs be subject to federal 
review. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRDC also called for a federal penny-a-bottle fee on bottled  
water to pay for a more vigorous regulatory program, testing and 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said Tuesday he would  
introduce legislation to impose stricter labeling requirements on 
the bottled water industry and require the product to meet the same 
standards for bacterial and chemical contamination as tap water. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRDC tested samples of bottled water purchased in  
California, Florida, Illinois, New York, Texas and the District of 
Columbia.

<HEADLINE>  Dow Closes at Record of 10,006.78 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the Dow Jones industrial average, the fourth  
time was lucky. 
</P>
<P>
	The 103-year-old index finally had the staying power Monday to  
make its first close above 10,000 after failing three times earlier 
this month. The blue chips rose 184.54 points to 10,006.78, and the 
floor of the New York Stock Exchange began a long-awaited 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE chairman Richard Grasso, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani  
and John Prestbo, index editor for Dow Jones &AMP; Co., banged the 
gavel symbolizing the close of the trading day and then began 
tossing baseball caps with ``Dow 10,000'' embroidered on the front. 
</P>
<P>
	In investment houses across the country, market watchers  
observed the occasion as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a moment to uncork the champagne and celebrate what a  
truly phenomenal bull market this has been,'' said Hugh Johnson, 
the longtime market strategist at First Albany Corp. in Albany, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	News that several big corporate mergers may be in the works  
spurred the Dow over 10,000 Monday. But, Grasso said at a press 
conference that credit for the milestone goes to investors who have 
poured money into stocks -- either directly or through mutual funds 
or pension plans -- for the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock exchange had nothing to do with Dow 10,000. It had  
to do with the huge number of participants in the marketplace. I 
want to send thank-yous to the 70 million Americans who participate 
directly in equities and another 130 million who participate 
indirectly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow first crossed 10,000 on March 16 but was unable to close  
above the milestone amid profit-taking and worries about upcoming 
quarterly profit reports. The same thing happened two days later 
that week. 
</P>
<P>
	For a while Monday, it looked like that pattern would be  
repeated. The blue chips hit 10,000 several times, but kept being 
knocked back down by computer-guided trading programs that sell 
stocks when the market reaches a predetermined level. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was enough underlying strength this time across a  
broad spectrum of stocks that the Dow was able to climb back up 
10,000 and stay there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's staying power was helped by an expansion of Wall  
Street's recent rally to a broader range of stocks -- it wasn't just 
the large, big-name companies like IBM and General Electric that 
gained, but smaller companies and lesser known names finally 
started to join the upward trend after some prolonged weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides merger news, including a possible deal between oil  
companies BP Amoco Corp. and Atlantic Richfield Co., incentive to 
buy came from the sense that Wall Street had seen the worst of 
warnings from companies that expected to report disappointing 
first-quarter profits. 
</P>
<P>
	But these were just the immediate reasons behind Monday's  
advance. The Dow -- and the overall stock market -- has surged higher 
on eight years of U.S. economic growth, a boom in mutual fund 
investment, and, most recently, a boom in high technology and 
investor fascination with the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's first close above 10,000 came just under a year after  
it closed above 9,000, on April 6, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	At several points over the past year, a Dow 10,000 seemed like  
an impossibility -- particularly on Aug. 31 of last year, when the 
blue chips plunged 512.61 to 7,539.07 amid concerns about 
struggling overseas economies and how they might hurt U.S. 
corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	But the market's resilience, due in large part to individual  
investors' confidence in stocks, has carried the Dow back.

quarterly profit reports. The same thing happened two days later 
that week. 
</P>
<P>
	For a while Monday, it looked like that pattern would be  
repeated. The blue chips hit 10,000 several times, but kept being 
knocked back down by computer-guided trading programs that sell 
stocks when the market reaches a predetermined level. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was enough underlying strength this time across a  
broad spectrum of stocks that the Dow was able to climb back up 
10,000 and stay there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's staying power was helped by an expansion of Wall  
Street's recent rally to a broader range of stocks -- it wasn't just 
the large, big-name companies like IBM and General Electric that 
gained, but smaller companies and lesser known names finally 
started to join the upward trend after some prolonged weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides merger news, including a possible deal between oil  
companies BP Amoco Corp. and Atlantic Richfield Co., incentive to 
buy came from the sense that Wall Street had seen the worst of 
warnings from companies that expected to report disappointing 
first-quarter profits. 
</P>
<P>
	But these were just the immediate reasons behind Monday's  
advance. The Dow -- and the overall stock market -- has surged higher 
on eight years of U.S. economic growth, a boom in mutual fund 
investment, and, most recently, a boom in high technology and 
investor fascination with the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's first close above 10,000 came just under a year after  
it closed above 9,000, on April 6, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	At several points over the past year, a Dow 10,000 seemed like  
an impossibility -- particularly on Aug. 31 of last year, when the 
blue chips plunged 512.61 to 7,539.07 amid concerns about 
struggling overseas economies and how they might hurt U.S. 
corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	But the market's resilience, due in large part to individual  
investors' confidence in stocks, has carried the Dow back.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll in India Quake at 110 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAMOLI, India (AP) -- Rescue workers were trying today to reach  
isolated villages crushed by a powerful earthquake in India's lower 
Himalayas that killed at least 110 people, with many more dead 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chamoli, the devastated town near the epicenter, residents  
and army engineers pulled survivors and corpses from under 
collapsed homes and shops. Soldiers were breaking up concrete slabs 
with power tools, while townspeople dug with shovels and their bare 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
	This small town of some 3,000 people looked like a mountain of  
rubble, with houses and markets razed by the quake, which ripped 
apart a chunk of a nearby mountain and showered the town and 
Alaknanda river below with boulders. 
</P>
<P>
	People scooped up food and cosmetics littering the streets.  
Dozens of funeral pyres crackled along the banks of the river today 
as residents cremated their loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake, measuring magnitude 6.8, damaged 90 percent of  
Chamoli and flattened 14 villages around it, officials said. It 
brought homes collapsing on their occupants as they slept or 
watched TV just after midnight in the early hours Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers quickly cleared the roads to allow trucks with relief  
supplies to reach Chamoli. But so far workers had cleared boulders 
from only one of four roads leading to the villages, cut off by 
massive landslides. Air Force rescue planes scoured the Himalayan 
expanse late Monday to survey possible access routes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dilip Kotia, a senior official in the Uttar Pradesh state  
government, said the death toll of 110 was expected to rise. 
Helicopters evacuated the most serious of the injured from isolated 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen tent camps have been set up in Chamoli, where water and  
power supplies were disrupted for a second day. In one tent, some 
10 children, aged 5 to 15, now orphans, huddled together crying. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds were injured in the 40-second jolt, said officials in  
the small town of Biyasi. The area is about 185 miles north of New 
Delhi, India's capital, where some buildings also suffered cracks 
and damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a minute, all the earth seemed shaking ... we all ran out  
of our houses very, very scared,'' said Himanshu Thapliyal, a 
28-year-old lawyer in Biyasi. 
</P>
<P>
	Romesh Sharma, a teacher in the nearby town of Nandprayag, said  
he rushed out of his house when he heard the thunder of the quake, 
only to see the buildings around him collapse. ``I ran for my 
life'' to the police station, but that too had crumpled, he told a 
local reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	After surveying the quake zone by helicopter, B.M. Vohra,  
commissioner of the Dehra Dun district, said there was an urgent 
need for tents and food. Four helicopters and 300 rescue workers 
were called into service. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second major quake in eight years to hit the Garhwal  
hills, which rise swiftly to the icy peaks of the Himalayas in 
northern India on the Chinese border. 
</P>
<P>
	The Himalaya foothills are considered particularly vulnerable to  
earthquakes, lying near the juncture where the tectonic plate of 
the Indian subcontinent grinds north into the Asian land mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists were warning citizens to brace for more aftershocks.  
With nearly 30 aftershocks recorded in the 24 hours after the 
quake, many people refused to return to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight tremors have been recorded this century measuring more  
than magnitude 6, but Monday's was the strongest in the region this 
century, seismologists said. 
</P>
<P>
	India's most lethal earthquake in recent times killed nearly  
10,000 people in western India in 1993. But the most powerful quake 
was in 1950 in Assam in eastern India, measuring 8.5.

<HEADLINE> Mother of 6 Admits Endangering Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- A woman believed to have a disorder that  
causes her to injure or kill children for attention has pleaded 
guilty to child injury charges and faces up to 32 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Cynthia Martinez Lyda, 32, entered the plea Monday on the eve of  
jury selection in her trial. Sentencing is set for this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have diagnosed Mrs. Lyda with Munchausen's syndrome by  
proxy, a disorder in which caregivers fake or induce illnesses in 
children to win attention by rescuing them. Mrs. Lyda denies having 
the condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Of her six sons, Aaron died when he was 2 years old of poisoning  
from ipecac, a syrup used to induce vomiting in children. Another 
son, Daniel, now 7, fell into a vegetative state at a hospital six 
years ago when a machine monitoring his respiratory and heart rate 
was turned off. 
</P>
<P>
	And a foster son died when he was 2 years old while in Mrs.  
Lyda's care in Phoenix in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Her guilty plea pertained to Joseph, 5, who nearly died when he  
was 8 months old. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Wilford Hall Medical Center on Lackland Air Force  
Base in San Antonio had installed a camera in the boy's room after 
becoming suspicious of the mother. The camera allegedly showed her 
disconnecting the tube and blowing into it, forcing air into his 
stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	She also allegedly was caught disconnecting a ventilator tube  
leading into the boy's trachea, depriving him of oxygen for a 
minute, and inserting some gauze into his feeding tube, blocking 
the flow of food. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lyda contended she was trying to unblock the tube.  
</P>
<P>
	``At the time, your honor, I intentionally did what I did,''  
Mrs. Lyda said in court. ``I understand it was reckless, especially 
now, five years later. But at the time, I thought it was best for 
my son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of her plea bargain, charges related to Daniel's case  
were dropped. No charges were filed against her in the deaths of 
Aaron and the foster child.

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes Sign Goaltender Irbe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Goaltender Arturs Irbe, who signed with the  
Carolina Hurricanes as a free agent in September, has earned 
himself a multi-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``He joined our team prior to training camp in what was viewed  
as a low-key acquisition,'' general manager Jim Rutherford said 
Tuesday in announcing the new contract ``To his credit, Arturs came 
in, worked hard and established himself as our number one 
goaltender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irbe, 31, has a 25-18-11 record for the Hurricanes and five  
shutouts so far this season, a franchise season record and fifth 
best in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Irbe, Minnesota's 11th pick in the 1989 draft, started his NHL  
career with San Jose in 1991. He signed as a free agent with Dallas 
in 1996, and then played last season in Vancouver.

<HEADLINE> Finding Spurs Farm History Debate / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- A tiny corn kernel is rewriting human  
history in the New World. 
</P>
<P>
	The kernel -- from a cob about the size of a child's finger -- was  
discovered by University of California, Berkeley archaeologist M. 
Steven Shackley and two University of New Mexico colleagues last 
summer in a cave in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Radiocarbon analysis at the Center for Accelerator Mass  
Spectrometry at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory shows the 
kernel is 3,690 years old. That makes it the oldest corn ever 
discovered in the United States and the oldest ever found anywhere 
outside central Mexico, where corn has been dated back 4,700 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery -- along with other new archaeological evidence of  
3,000-year-old human villages and irrigation canals near Tucson 
uncovered during construction of Interstate 10 -- have switched 
archaeology's focus from New Mexico and the Colorado plateau to 
southern Arizona as the cradle of early farming in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Southwest has been continuously inhabited at least 12,000  
years, but these discoveries are pushing back in time the 
transition to agriculture and village life,'' said Jonathan Mabry, 
a Tucson archaeologist who made some of the village discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
	``These finds have made a lot of textbooks obsolete,'' he added.  
</P>
<P>
	The discoveries also provide clues to the origin of the people  
the Navajos call the Anasazi, who created the cliff dwellings of 
Mesa Verde in Colorado and the pueblos in Chaco Canyon, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	Archaeologists are beginning to believe the Anasazi may have  
been the descendants of those early farmers around Tucson and their 
ancestors who farmed in canyons of the Southwest and Northern 
Mexico, Shackley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shackley discovered the corn with two University of New Mexico  
Maxwell Museum colleagues, archaeologist Bruce Huckell and his 
wife, Lisa Huckell, a paleoethnobotanist. 
</P>
<P>
	Their search brought them for the last two summers to McEuen  
Cave in the Gila Mountains, about 70 miles northeast of Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn residue has been found in Panama roughly dated from 5,000  
to 6,000 years old, and experts believe corn probably originated as 
a tropical grass somewhere in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	``The McEuen Cave discovery is another piece of information that  
indicates that maize arrived in the Southwest much earlier than we 
used to think -- now obviously at least 4,000 years ago -- and that 
brought rapid changes in the way people lived,'' Shackley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now know that by 3,000 years ago, these hunter gatherers  
settled down and lived in farming villages,'' he said. ``That's a 
very new idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their discovery also brings smiles to the Hopi, whose language  
traces back to Uto-Aztecan and who are among the most likely 
descendants of the ancient farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the Hopi, in our belief system, corn is very, very old. Now  
science is proving it to be as old as we have always believed,'' 
says Leigh J. Kuwanwisiwma, director of the Hopi Cultural 
Preservation office in Kykotsmovi, Ariz.

<HEADLINE> IMF, Russia Said Working on Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian government and the International  
Monetary Fund are still working out the size of a loan to help 
Russia revive its economy, a senior cabinet official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia and the IMF said Monday they had agreed in principle on a  
new loan, but First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said the 
amount will be ``subject to calculation'' during a visit by an IMF 
team next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian newspapers, citing unidentified officials, have said  
that the IMF is preparing to give Russia $4.8 billion -- just a bit 
more than the $4.5 billion Russia needs to pay the fund this year 
for its previous loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Maslyukov dismissed these accounts, but did not provide any  
figures of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said the actual size of the  
loan was of secondary importance. Russia has largely been cut off 
from international financing since the country's economy imploded 
last August, and the government believes the IMF credit will have a 
snowball effect, encouraging other lenders to offer new loans, or 
reschedule old ones. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF chief Michel Camdessus wrapped up three days of talks in  
Moscow on Monday, and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said the fund 
had agreed in principle to release a loan that the government has 
been trying to win since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF mission and the government must prepare a joint policy  
statement to be presented to the IMF board of directors for 
approval as early as April 24, with the first installment of any 
loan expected shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials have said they were asking for $8 billion from  
the IMF to help avert a looming default on the nation's foreign 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, the loan is expected to be much smaller than the  
$22.6 billion bailout package the IMF arranged for Russia last 
summer. The installments were suspended after the country's 
financial markets collapsed in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is supposed to pay off $17.5 billion to foreign creditors  
this year, but has factored only about half of the sum into this 
year's budget. It hopes to reschedule or write off the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin, who delivered a state of the nation  
address to parliament today, said the government's inability to 
collect taxes and the chronic budget deficits have contributed to 
the economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia's difficulties must not be blamed on the market  
economy, but on the ugly transitional system stuck halfway between 
the central planning and free-market economy,'' Yeltsin said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Jordan May Be Hornet Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Jordan is considering returning to  
the NBA as a player for the Charlotte Hornets, Fox Sports News 
reported Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	It was already known that Jordan, who retired earlier this year  
after leading the Chicago Bulls to six championships, had 
preliminary talks with the Hornets and NBA officials about 
purchasing a 50 percent share of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of him playing for the Hornets is a new twist.  
</P>
<P>
	Fox Sports, citing anonymous sources close to Jordan, said one  
possible scenario would involve Jordan playing one full season for 
the Hornets while his ownership shares were held in a trust or 
otherwise deferred. 
</P>
<P>
	That scenario also would include Phil Jackson being brought in  
to coach the team for one year and Dean Smith, Jordan's college 
coach at North Carolina, being brought aboard as team president. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox cited a quote by Jordan saying he ``has to stay in shape.''  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's agent, David Falk, could not immediately be reached for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan issued a statement Monday confirming his interest in  
owning half of the team. He met last week with commissioner David 
Stern and current Hornets owner George Shinn. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this stage,'' Jordan said, ``the discussions are very  
preliminary and I am unsure whether I will be able to make an 
investment on terms that are acceptable to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, who grew up in Wilmington and starred at North Carolina,  
said staying involved in the NBA ``would be a fulfilling personal 
and business challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In addition, as a North Carolina native, I would welcome the  
opportunity to be involved in growing the Hornets into an elite NBA 
team,'' Jordan said. ``It would be premature to comment any 
further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At his retirement press conference in January, Jordan declared  
himself ``99.9 percent'' retired. He previously gave up basketball 
in October, 1993, to pursue a career in professional baseball, then 
un-retired in the spring of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Hornets officials have said that no firm dates were set for the  
sides to meet again, but that both parties had agreed to stay in 
touch. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the report, Harold Kaufman, a spokesman for the  
Hornets, said, ``I haven't heard anything like that.''

<HEADLINE> Whites Beat Minorities Off Welfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A strong economy and tough new rules have  
combined to move people off welfare in unprecedented numbers. But 
white Americans are leaving faster than others, raising crucial 
questions as states try to continue decreasing their caseloads. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country, the proportion of blacks, Hispanics and  
American Indians on assistance has grown, in some cases 
dramatically, according to a 50-state Associated Press survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Welfare researchers and state officials, monitoring the impact  
of the 1996 welfare overhaul, say the disparity is understandable 
given that minorities as a group begin poorer and live farther from 
many jobs. Nevertheless, the numbers are causing concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just leads to greater polarization between classes, between  
races,'' said Bruce Katz, who studies urban issues at the Brookings 
Institution. ``It just sort of eats away at the social fabric.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 33 of 42 states, the proportion of white welfare recipients  
has dropped since 1994, when caseloads peaked nationally, the AP 
survey found. In the other eight states, either the number of 
minorities is too small to be meaningful, or such statistics are 
not kept. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 16 big states, home to 76 percent of people on welfare,  
14 have seen whites leave welfare faster than blacks or Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	Take Ohio, where blacks on welfare now outnumber whites for the  
first time. In 1995, 54 percent of people on welfare were white, 42 
percent black. By this year, 53 percent were black and 42 percent 
white. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the Dakotas, American Indians have come to dominate  
welfare. In North Dakota, they grew to 56 percent from 28 percent 
in 1993. In South Dakota, they jumped to 77 percent from 54 percent 
over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the 1996 welfare changes took hold, minorities as a  
group were poorer and more likely to live in strikingly poor inner 
cities, experts note. Compared even with whites on welfare, blacks 
and Hispanics begin with many disadvantages, census statistics 
indicate. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997:  
</P>
<P>
	--Thirty percent of whites on welfare lacked a high school  
diploma, compared with 43 percent of blacks and 64 percent of 
Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	--Just 29 percent of whites on welfare lived in a central city,  
or an area where at least one in five people were poor. For blacks, 
it was about 68 percent, for Hispanics about 60 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Place is a vital factor: It's much easier for someone who lives  
in a booming suburb to find a job and leave welfare than someone in 
a rundown central city. At the same time, many schools are poor, 
the crime rate is higher and housing can be substandard. 
</P>
<P>
	In short, changing lives steeped in poverty often takes more  
than a pep talk about going to work and the threat of losing aid, 
as is the case in many states. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where you live dictates so much about your life opportunity,''  
Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The same goes for American Indians who live on isolated  
reservations, where finding a job can be very tough. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials, trying to explain the shift, point to  
demographics: A paper prepared by the Council of Economic Advisers 
but not released publicly notes the proportion of Hispanics and 
blacks in the nation overall is growing, explaining some of the 
welfare shift. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, more minorities are in ``child-only'' cases, where a poor  
child lives with someone other than parents, and welfare is paid 
only to support the child. Thus, the work requirements pushing 
people off welfare don't come into play. 
</P>
<P>
	Some also suspect employers are less likely to hire a black  
welfare recipient than a white one. Others worry that services to 
help people find work are less available to blacks and Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the reasons, implications of the shift are serious.  
</P>
<P>
	Blacks have long been overrepresented on the welfare rolls --  
they make up just 12 percent of the population but a larger share 
of the welfare pool. But in sheer numbers, there always have been 
more whites, a fact often noted by advocates for the poor. Now with 
blacks set to outnumber whites -- if they don't already -- some worry 
racist stereotypes will gain new momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilary Shelton of the National Association for the Advancement  
of Colored People worries the shift will undercut his work's 
central theme -- ``that everyone has potential for greatness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People begin to argue there's nothing you can do about those  
people,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others worry the shift could undercut welfare's shaky political  
backing. ``You lose the support of suburban-rural majorities in 
most states,'' said Jack Tweedie, who tracks welfare for the 
National Conference of State Legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
	But reversing the trends will not be easy, said William Waldman,  
who directs the Washington group representing state welfare 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Welfare is often a reflection of the larger economic and  
social circumstances of the nation,'' he said. ``Clearly we have a 
ways to go in the area of equal opportunity.''

	FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) -- A grand jury will investigate whether  
George Jones should be charged in a wreck that left him critically 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Williamson County District Attorney Ronald Davis said Monday

<P>
	The country singer lost control of his sport utility vehicle and  
crashed into a bridge on March 6. His family said he was talking to 
his stepdaughter on a cellular phone at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 67, suffered a punctured lung and lacerated liver. He  
spent 13 days in the hospital and was discharged March 19. 
</P>
<P>
	A half-pint of vodka described as less than half-full was found  
under the passenger's seat of Jones' vehicle, the Tennessee Highway 
Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigating officer said there was no indication Jones had  
been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said the lack of a blood alcohol test at the time of the  
crash means that the grand jury will have to subpoena evidence from 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center and question witnesses.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets Nigeria's Obasanjo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton met Tuesday with  
President-elect Olesegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, who said he will 
build democracy in the West African nation despite ``the views and 
the thinking of the skeptics'' who say corruption will endure. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Obasanjo talked for roughly a half-hour about  
establishing democratic rule in Nigeria, Africa's most populous 
nation and one regarded by the Clinton administration as a 
potential force for political stability in the rest of the 
continent. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Obasanjo said he assured Clinton that Nigeria will  
continue to lead a West African peacekeeping force now deployed in 
Sierra Leone, which is wracked by civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, he said he will work to ensure that Nigeria's  
military becomes more professional and performs its constitutional 
role. ``We will give them what they need to look after their 
welfare, but we will also keep them under the control of the 
civil'' authority, Obasanjo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton emphasized that democracy is essential if Nigeria hopes  
to experience increased investment and economic reform, said White 
House national security spokesman Mike Hammer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obasanjo was very much committed to democracy as the basic way  
for the future of Nigeria,'' Hammer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo, a retired general, was Nigeria's military leader from  
1976 until 1979, when he returned power to a civilian government. 
The military took over again four years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo had been jailed by Nigerian dictator Gen. Sani Abacha,  
who died last June. After Abacha died, his successor, Gen. 
Abdulasalam Abubakar, steered Nigeria toward civilian rule and 
Obasanjo was elected in February. 
</P>
<P>
	His current U.S. tour is part of an overall tour of several  
countries before his May 29 inauguration. Besides Clinton, Obasanjo 
also met Tuesday with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and 
Defense Secretary William Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has been invited to Obasanjo's inauguration but has not  
yet said whether he will attend.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas-Little Rock Gets New Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Sidney Moncrief is done selling cars,  
and getting back to basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Milwaukee Bucks star, who helped send Arkansas to the  
Final Four in 1978, was hired Tuesday as the coach at 
Arkansas-Little Rock -- his first job in coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	He replaces Wimp Sanderson, who resigned March 1 after the  
Trojans finished with a 12-15 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the last 10 years, I've waited for the right opportunity.  
This is the right opportunity,'' said Moncrief, who has owned a car 
dealership in a Little Rock suburb since retiring from the NBA in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Moncrief, born and raised in Little Rock, plans to split his  
time between his dealership and the university the next six weeks 
before devoting himself fully to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't be more thrilled to have Sidney Moncrief as our  
basketball coach,'' athletic director Rick Mello said. ``We were 
extremely pleased with the quality of people who showed interest in 
the position, but to end up with Sidney Moncrief exceeds all of our 
expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moncrief says he has always wanted to coach and is not treating  
this job as a steppingstone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went to college to be a coach and coaches have always had a  
big influence on my life,'' Moncrief said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My intention is to stay in central Arkansas. My job is to  
build this program,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was made at Little Rock's River Market. UALR's  
new basketball home, an 18,000-seat arena, is being built directly 
across the river in North Little Rock. The Sun Belt Conference 
school had been playing in 8,000-seat Barton Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Moncrief's reputation and state connections are expected to be a  
big help in recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old coach played under Eddie Sutton at Arkansas and  
is the Razorbacks' second-leading career scorer and top rebounder. 
In the NBA, he spent 10 seasons with the Bucks and one with the 
Atlanta Hawks.

<HEADLINE> NBC Win Tightens Ratings Race / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Futurama'' may really have a future.  
</P>
<P>
	The new animated comedy from Matt Groening, creator of ``The  
Simpsons,'' scored solid ratings Sunday during an encouraging week 
for new shows. The Fox cartoon set in the year 3000 tied for 11th 
place in the Nielsen Media Research ratings last week -- 
outdistancing even ``The Simpsons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC won the week's prime-time competition with a 9.0 rating and  
15 share, tightening its race with CBS for the season's top spot by 
doing well on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, not normally its 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS was second with an 8.7 rating and 15 share, ABC had a 7.0  
rating and 12 share and Fox was at 6.5 and 11. The WB had a 3.0 
rating and 5 share, UPN was at 1.8 and 3 and Pax TV was at 0.8 and 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	Though not as impressive as ``Futurama,'' two new ABC comedies  
also had strong weeks. ``The Norm Show,'' the new comedy starring 
Norm McDonald, finished in 20th place and ``It's Like, You Know'' 
came in 33rd. 
</P>
<P>
	``ER'' was the week's most-watched show, as it has been for each  
of the 17 original episodes this year. However, it had the lowest 
rating for an ``ER'' original since 1994, perhaps an indication 
viewers are confused by the midseason reruns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nickelodeon cable network celebrated a Nielsen milestone --  
with milk and cookies, of course. It was the top-rated cable 
network, on an all-day basis, for the first three months of the 
year, Nielsen said Tuesday. It is Nick's 14th straight quarterly 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, Fox News Channel defeated its rival MSNBC in  
the prime-time quarterly ratings. Fox's average prime-time audience 
has increased from 79,000 households in early 1998 to 223,000 
households this year. MSNBC's prime-time average was 201,000 
households. Both news networks trailed CNN, whose ratings were 
slightly down at 747,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
	MSNBC points out that it leads during all-day ratings, and has  
seen more of a boost than Fox over the past week in ratings because 
of the Yugoslavian bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' and ABC's ``World News Tonight'' finished  
in a dead heat in last week's evening news race with 8.2 ratings 
and 17 shares. The ``CBS Evening News'' had a 7.0 rating and 15 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC won for the quarter in nightly news. All three networks had  
lower ratings than last year, however. CBS's slip was the steepest. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of March 22-28, the top 10 shows, their networks  
and ratings were ``ER,'' NBC, 18.6; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 16.2; ``60 
Minutes,'' CBS, 14.3; ``Friends,'' NBC, 14.1; ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' CBS, 13.7, ``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 13.4; ``Jesse,'' 
NBC, 12.9; ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 12.1; ``CBS Sunday Movie: 
Holy Joe,'' CBS, 11.3; ``Law and Order,'' NBC, 11.3.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Rise on Aid to Russia Talk / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures moved sharply higher Tuesday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade after Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman 
said the government is considering a significant new aid package to 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman's announcement was welcome news to a market that has  
found little to cheer about. Soybean prices have been weak amid 
active harvesting of competing Brazilian crops and expectations the 
U.S. Agriculture Department will report farmers this spring plan to 
plant record acreage to soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	The chance for the government to make significant purchases of  
soybeans, soybean meal and soybean oil for donation could help buoy 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and wheat futures finished mixed in dull trading that came  
as investors squared positions ahead of the USDA's first planting 
intentions report. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery finished unchanged at $3.04 a bushel;  
May corn was unchanged at $2.32 a bushel; May oats fell 1 3/4 cents to 
$1.21 3/4 a bushel; May soybeans rose 5 1/2 cents to $5.01 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and lean hogs were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while feeder cattle advanced and pork bellies retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle fell .05 cent to 66.72 cents a pound; April  
feeder cattle rose .05 cent to 71.77 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell 1.65 cents to 52.07 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell the 
limit 3 cents to 51.47 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Marine Navigator Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- The navigator of the Marine jet that  
cut a ski cable in the Italian Alps said it was ``stupid'' to 
destroy the videotape that captured part of the flight that led to 
20 deaths last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I did was wrong,'' said Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, who  
faces up to 10 years in prison after pleading guilty Monday to 
charges of obstruction and conspiracy to obstruct justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here today to take responsibility for my actions,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., said he swapped the videotape  
he shot for a blank one after the EA-6B Prowler jet landed at the 
NATO base in Aviano, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	He explained that he took the tape because he didn't want it to  
become an issue in what he thought would be a probe of the tragedy 
by Italian authorities. At the time, there was no Marine Corps 
criminal probe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Let's take the tape,''' to pilot Capt. Richard Ashby,  
Schweitzer said. ``It was a stupid thing to do and I regret that. 
It was a rash decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A sentencing panel was to be chosen today. Each charge carries a  
maximum penalty of five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer said that at one point during the flight he had  
pointed the camera at himself and smiled. Ashby had warned him that 
the Italian media and authorities would ``eat you alive'' if they 
saw the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	``The video had nothing to do with the mishap,'' Schweitzer  
said. ``It wasn't on in the valley. I didn't want it to be an 
issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, Schweitzer said he tossed the original tape into  
a fire. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had stopped taping about 10 minutes before the jet  
streaked toward the Cavalese valley at 620 mph in February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The wing of the Prowler cut the ski gondola cable when the jet  
dropped to 370 feet above the valley floor. Three Italians, two 
Poles, seven Germans, five Belgians, two Austrians and one Dutch 
passenger died. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe is the type of guy who wants to stand up and take  
responsibility,'' said Dave Beck, Schweitzer's attorney. ``There 
were some bad mistakes made after the accident and they made bad 
decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was acquitted by a military  
jury at Camp Lejeune of manslaughter and other charges on March 4, 
outraging Italian authorities and straining relations with the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tragedy that becomes more confusing as the evidence  
is destroyed,'' said John Arthur Eaves Sr., an attorney 
representing the families of the German victims in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Three relatives of victims of the accident will be allowed to  
testify that the missing tape leaves a doubt about why their loved 
ones died. Other evidence includes affidavits from Schweitzer's 
squadron mates who are back at Aviano flying missions over 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appreciate Schweitzer's honesty,'' said Lorenzo Dellai,  
president of the Italian province of Trento, the region where the 
accident occurred. ``It is a contribution to clearness, which has 
always been lacking in this sad story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, faces trial on the same obstruction charges next  
month.

<HEADLINE> Store Killing May Be Justified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COMPTON, Calif. (AP) -- A 12-year-old boy protecting his  
grandmother shot and killed a 16-year-old during a holdup at the 
woman's convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
	Police believe the killing was justified, but prosecutors will  
make the final decision about whether to charge the boy, whose name 
was not released. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors and friends said both boys were basically good kids  
whose lives intersected tragically in a poor, gang-ridden city of 
mostly blacks and Hispanics living in small, ragged bungalows with 
bars on the windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen, Dennis Smith, was a high school dropout who wrote song  
lyrics but was taking classes to obtain a diploma so he could go on 
to college. However, police said he had at least two arrests for 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	He had tried for months to get a job, said a friend, Alicia  
Torres, 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it's just, hey, desperation. Obviously, you know he  
wanted money because he was robbing the store. I mean, he wouldn't 
go in there to get no damn Pampers,'' she said. But as for the 
shooting, ``I would have shot him, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 99 Cents Plus Mini Market, owned by the younger boy's  
grandmother, sits on a shabby block of storefronts 18 miles 
southeast of downtown Los Angeles. It was robbed twice in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Around noon on Sunday, police said, two teen-agers entered the  
market. One put a machine pistol to the head of the 62-year-old 
owner, but another employee managed to knock it away and began 
struggling with the youth. The other robber, the 16-year-old, began 
to beat the owner. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman's grandson grabbed a handgun kept in the store and  
fired, Lt. Michael Sneed said. The 16-year-old was shot several 
times and died at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The other robber fled, but investigators had several leads and  
expected to arrest him by Friday, Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
	The grandmother had only minor bruises. The 12-year-old was  
allowed to go home to his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	He lives with her and two sisters in a small duplex. His father  
is in Mexico. Neighbors said he often was seen playing with other 
kids in the narrow strip of concrete and grass under the 
clothesline between apartments because the park nearby is too 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	The grandmother, originally from Durango, Mexico, worked hard at  
the store seven days a week, and the boy helped out on weekends, 
said Juan Zamora, 51, who makes leather goods in a shop next door. 
</P>
<P>
	``Always they have troubles because everybody try to steal,'' he  
said. ``The police come very late. They come after one hour, after 
three hours, after four hours. Everybody is still afraid. Nobody 
protects us.''

<HEADLINE> Catholics Urge San Francisco Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A Catholic group called for a boycott  
Monday of San Francisco as a convention site because of a planned 
Easter Sunday celebration featuring drag queens in nun's habits. 
</P>
<P>
	In a half-page ad in the San Francisco Chronicle, the Catholic  
League for Religious and Civil Rights called on all Catholic 
organizations to hold conventions elsewhere unless the drag queens 
choose another day for their party. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's face it, we're not going to bring San Francisco to its  
knees,'' league President William A. Donohue said. ``In the long 
run, we hope Catholics will awaken from their slumber and realize 
it's late in the day if they want to fight for their rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence are a group of mostly gay  
men who dress in bizarre habits, elaborate make-up and wigs. The 
group says it was founded on Easter Sunday and plans to mark the 
date with a celebration as it always does. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the events planned for the street party in the Castro  
district are a ``Hunky Jesus'' contest and an Easter bonnet 
competition. The Sisters performed an ``exorcism'' during the 
pope's visit in 1987 and have held a ``Condom Savior Mass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sisters raise money for AIDS and gay rights groups, but  
Donohue said he is not impressed with their charitable work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a group that's anti-black or anti-Jewish or anti-gay  
contributing to fighting AIDS,'' he said in a telephone interview 
from the league's New York headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	In an editorial in Friday's edition of Catholic San Francisco,  
the Archdiocese newspaper, the church called for ``calm and clear 
thinking'' to find a solution. 
</P>
<P>
	The League is also mad at the city's Board of Supervisors, which  
granted the permit for the celebration. After the local Archbishop 
protested last week, Mayor Willie Brown and two other city 
officials asked supervisors to reconsider the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Monday night, after hearing two hours of public comment  
in a packed recreation center, the supervisors upheld the permit by 
a 9-2 vote. It would have taken a unanimous vote to overturn the 
decision.

<HEADLINE> Rapp Boosts Red Sox Pitching Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. (AP) -- One day after Mark Portugal allowed  
seven runs in an inning and Bret Saberhagen began his comeback from 
shoulder problems, Pat Rapp gave Boston's starting rotation a 
needed boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the bullpen picture became clearer Tuesday when  
right-hander Brad Clontz was sent to Boston's minor league camp and 
left-hander Ron Mahay was claimed on waivers by Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston may not need its relievers as much if Rapp continues to  
pitch the way he did in Tuesday's 7-1 win over the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fine,'' Rapp (2-0) said after allowing one run and four  
hits in 5 2-3 innings. ``After the second week of spring training, 
we changed my mechanics and that's what we've been working on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's starting more from the middle of the rubber, has dropped  
his hands lower in his windup and has slowed his delivery. After 
walking 107 batters in 188 1-3 innings last season with Kansas 
City, Rapp doesn't mind pitching coach Joe Kerrigan's tinkering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doesn't take much for a guy to change me and figure out why  
I walked all those guys,'' Rapp said. ``I've got a good infield 
behind me. I've got to let the hitters hit the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rapp was 12-13 with a 5.30 ERA last season, but one reason the  
Red Sox signed him as a free agent is his ability to pitch a lot of 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, he had the longest of his six exhibition outings,  
struck out three, walked one and lowered his ERA from 5.40 to 4.43. 
The only run was a fourth-inning leadoff homer by Juan Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
	``He threw good, real good, against a tough lineup,'' manager  
Jimy Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 1 starter Pedro Martinez has had an outstanding spring.  
Saberhagen pitched three innings in a minor league game Monday and 
should be ready for his regular-season debut next Wednesday at 
Kansas City. Tim Wakefield is set as the third starter. Portugal, 
fourth in the rotation, hadn't pitched in 10 days because of a 
stiff back before struggling in Monday's 12-4 loss to Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Rapp's first start is scheduled for April 11 against Tampa Bay  
in the finale of Boston's season-opening six-game road trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just felt mechanically sound today,'' he said. ``I wasn't  
trying to rush the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Mark Guthrie, Derek Lowe, Jim Corsi and Tom Gordon assured  
of jobs, nine of the 11 spots on Boston's opening-day pitching 
staff are locked up, barring a trade or injury. Kip Gross, John 
Wasdin and lefty Rheal Cormier are the leading candidates for the 
two bullpen jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't set anything yet,'' Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
	Clontz spent three seasons with Atlanta, the first two while  
Williams was a coach there. He was 8-1 with a 3.65 ERA in 1995, 6-3 
and 5.69 in 1996 and 5-1 and 3.75 the next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta released him late in spring training last season and he  
pitched 18 games with Los Angeles, two with the New York Mets and 
34 in the minors before undergoing elbow surgery last September. 
</P>
<P>
	``He needs more work,'' Williams said. ``He's throwing free, but  
sometimes you've got to go back to the minors and start over, put 
up some numbers and work your way up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clontz was 2-1 with a 4.15 ERA in 8 2-3 innings over nine  
appearances in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahay split last season between Boston and Triple-A Pawtucket  
but his chances were hurt when the club signed Guthrie, another 
lefty reliever, last Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those things happen,'' Williams said of the loss of Mahay, who  
started in the Boston organization in 1991 as an outfielder and 
became a pitcher in 1996. ``Can't keep 'em all.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Red Sox released outfielder Midre Cummings, who led AL  
pinch-hitters with a .346 batting average last year. He became 
expendable when Boston obtained outfielder Jon Nunnally from 
Cincinnati last Thursday, although Williams said Nunnally hasn't 
won a roster spot and praised Keith Mitchell, another contender for 
a backup outfielder job. Cummings gets $110,656 in termination pay 
instead of the $450,000 he was awarded as a loser in salary 
arbitration. ... Shortstop Nomar Garciaparra made his second error 
of spring training in the fourth inning. He originally was charged 
with another error in the third when he bobbled a ball hit to his 
right. The ruling was changed to a single for Royce Clayton. ... 
Martinez, who struck out 10 batters in six innings in his last 
start, makes his final spring training appearance Wednesday against 
Pittsburgh in Bradenton. ... Infielder Lou Merloni returned to the

fielded grounders before Tuesday's game, but Williams said he isn't 
ready to play.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Q: I've been hearing more and more lately about investing on the  
Internet. Should I be considering it? 

</P>
<P>
	A: Yes, provided you have a clear picture of what it can and  
cannot do for you. 
</P>
<P>
	World Wide Web sites operated by brokers, mutual fund firms and  
other financial services businesses have much to offer investors -- 
speed, convenience and access to abundant information about 
investing, among other things. Chat rooms and other Internet 
facilities also give investors good ways to exchange ideas and 
opinions among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	By all accounts, online investing is the way of the future,  
although it may never completely replace old-fashioned systems and 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet electronic investing has received a lot of negative  
attention lately, in part because of its image as a world of 
trigger-happy day traders who never stop to learn much about the 
stocks or funds they buy and sell. Someday, many observers suggest, 
this is all going to come to a bad end. 
</P>
<P>
	It does indeed appear that a new breed of investors is trading,  
almost video-game style, through Internet brokers who charge very 
low commission rates -- less than $10 a trade, in many cases. 
History suggests that many of these people will wind up suffering 
painful losses, especially if the great bull market on Wall Street 
should slow down or expire altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	But investors can use the 'Net without losing their long-term  
perspective. The trick is to realize that a mechanism that makes it 
much easier and cheaper to buy and sell often doesn't automatically 
mean it is a good idea to buy and sell often. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the benefits of the Internet for long-term investors:  
Access at any time to up-to-date information on the status of your 
account with a broker or fund family. Handy reference to research 
reports, historical data and other information useful in making 
investment decisions. Hundreds of sites where you can browse, 
without cost, for information about retirement planning, saving for 
college, and other subjects.

<HEADLINE>  Duke Students Upset With Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM (AP) -- Students filed out of Cameron Indoor Stadium in  
stunned silence Monday night after the Connecticut Huskies upset 
the Blue Devils 77-74 to win their first NCAA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of students poured into the arena and crowded around a  
giant television screen to watch the game. Some spread out on 
blankets on the tarp-covered floor, while others sat in some of the 
arena's 8,800 seats to get a view. 
</P>
<P>
	Spotlights illuminated banners from Duke's NCAA titles in 1991  
and 1992 as the scoreboard ticked off the minutes before tipoff. 
</P>
<P>
	A Duke victory likely would have triggered a wild celebration,  
featuring a towering bonfire at the center of campus. At least nine 
car-sized wooden benches were piled up and set aflame after Duke's 
89-77 win over North Carolina on Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Many fans stood throughout the game as a band urged them on.  
</P>
<P>
	But as Connecticut built a five-point lead late in the second  
half, doubt started creeping in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just need to play our game, mentally tough, relaxed,'' said  
a grim-faced Matt Weiss, a junior from Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	When Trajan Langdon lost the ball in the closing seconds to  
clinch the Huskies' victory, Duke's notoriously rowdy crowd fell 
deathly silent. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans marched to the center of campus and started a  
traditional bonfire, but the mood was grim. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel defeated, even though we weren't the ones playing,''  
said freshman Erica Biro, from Boca Raton, Fla. ``It's so shocking. 
That's why the silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a fire of defeat,'' said Kristin Pitman, a freshman  
from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Talene Yacoubian, a graduate student in neurobiology from  
Chattanooga, Tenn., had her second painful experience watching Duke 
lose a national championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was here in '94 in this building when they lost to  
Arkansas,''she said ``I have to stick around in grad school until 
they finally win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yacoubian also said she may have to ditch her lucky shoes. She  
was wearing a pair of sneakers and said the only time this season 
she didn't wear them was when Duke lost to Cincinnati in the Great 
Alaska Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	She was wearing her lucky shoes again Monday night, but they  
didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess their charm is gone.''  
</P>
<P>
	Several female fans wept after the game. Others took the  
shocking loss in stride. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not taking it as hard as some folks, maybe it's a freshman  
thing,'' said freshman Elizabeth Fulk of Winston-Salem. ``I am 
proud to be at this school.''

<HEADLINE> China Businessman Eyes Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- Lawrence Cheung wants to bring the  
Internet into Chinese living rooms. But first, he has to give the 
Chinese people a reason and a way to log on. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of Web sites are in English, a language most  
Chinese don't speak. And few homes in China have computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheung's answer is Shanghai WebTV, a company that is creating  
Chinese Web sites for Internet novices to surf using only a TV set, 
a joystick and a button. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people want to get on the Net but they say, `I can't  
use a computer; I can't read English.' I want to bridge that gap,'' 
said Cheung, 31, who left the Hong Kong branch of the J. Walter 
Thompson advertising agency to start Shanghai WebTVwith two 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheung's firm is one of many companies -- small startups and  
established giants like Microsoft -- that are trying to eliminate 
technical, language and political barriers and grab a share of the 
Internet market in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	That market is expected to boom in the coming years. Chinese  
leaders are encouraging Internet use as a tool for building the 
high-tech industry. Internet cafes, where customers can buy time on 
a terminal, are common in major cities. State-owned China Telecom 
cut access rates in half recently to encourage use and spur 
innovation. 
</P>
<P>
	There are obstacles to be overcome. The communist government  
remains wary of the potential for the Internet to spread dissent 
and wants to protect its infant information industry from foreign 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, China's population of Internet users grew fourfold last  
year to 2.1 million. Another 1.5 million are expected to sign up 
this year. Personal computer sales grew 14 percent last year to 
40.5 billion yuan, the equivalent of $4.9 billion, according to the 
consulting firm International Data Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this trend continues, it's very likely that China will be  
the second-largest market in the world in a few years,'' said Jim 
Jarrett, president of U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp.'s China division. 
</P>
<P>
	Access to that promising market for foreign companies is  
slighter easier since regulators allowed a handful of joint 
ventures such as Shanghai WebTV, whose Chinese partner is a 
Shanghai city government agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In the biggest deal, Microsoft and China Telecom, which runs  
China's main online network, said they will launch a TV-based 
Internet service that could reach millions of users. Microsoft says 
equipment should go on sale later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	A TV-based system has obvious appeal in China. The 9,000 yuan,  
or $1,100, price of a basic PC is far above the national average 
income of 6,500 yuan, or $785, a year. By contrast, Shanghai 
WebTVsays its receivers could cost as little as 1,500 yuan, or 
$180. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard Co. and other industry leaders  
have research labs in China, in part to tailor products for Chinese 
needs. In Shanghai, 150 Intel researchers are trying to perfect 
technology to make computers respond to spoken commands. 
</P>
<P>
	``In China, I think it's much better if we can talk to a  
computer rather than use a keyboard, which is not natural for a 
Chinese,'' said Albert Yu, the Shanghai-born senior vice president 
of Intel. 
</P>
<P>
	China has an Internet search engine, online shopping for books  
and stocks and Web sites for soccer teams, newspapers and 
government agencies -- all in Chinese. Dialing a three-digit phone 
number anywhere nationwide connects users to the local node of the 
China Telecom network. 
</P>
<P>
	The system is far from perfect. Users complain about high access  
fees and poor service at many of China's more than 200 local 
Internet service providers. Sites regarded as pornographic or 
politically dangerous are blocked. 
</P>
<P>
	But the biggest complaint is language. In a government survey in  
December, 20 percent of users said the Internet had too little 
Chinese-language material. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanghai WebTV's offerings include sports, interactive games,  
stock market information and English lessons. 
</P>
<P>
	The company WebTVhas China's first license for e-commerce, such  
as online shopping, Cheung said, but he is reluctant to use it 
until the undeveloped Chinese delivery industry can guarantee 
buyers will get the goods. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't clear, anyway, whether China is ready for online  
shopping. Credit cards are rare, and 75 percent of Net users have 
family incomes below 2,000 yuan, or $250 a month, the government 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first stage is to get to know foreign technology. The next  
is to adapt it to Chinese characteristics. We haven't reached that 
point yet,'' Cheung said.

<HEADLINE> Relief Agencies Aid Kosovo Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP ) -- Relief agencies are scrambling to provide  
enough food and medicine for thousands of refugees streaming out of 
Kosovo as they attempt deal with one of Europe's largest forced 
exoduses since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Secretary of State Julia Taft, whose responsibilities  
include refugees, said Monday that international aid organizations 
would help those fleeing to Albania and Macedonia on Yugoslavia's 
southern border and to Montenegro, which is part of the Yugoslav 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
	``For those who are able to get out, they will be able to avail  
themselves to international protection,'' Taft said. ``We are going 
to be ready with the international community to provide 
assistance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said food supplies were being moved to Albania, where 60,000  
refugees were reported to have arrived in the last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is enough food in Albania for 100,000 people for one  
month,'' Taft said. ``And within that time, you can resupply very 
easily. That's not the problem. But that's the place where we're 
looking for the largest surge and the pipeline can be responsive 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the United States was working with the U.N. High  
Commission for Refugees and the International Committee for the Red 
Cross and 55 nongovernment organizations, many with experience in 
Kosovo, on various contingency plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Taft said the United States provided $8.5 million to the UNHCR  
on Friday to help it buy nonfood items such as medicine, blankets 
and tents.

<HEADLINE> What's on Deck for Cuba? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- For once, baseball people seem to agree -- this  
Cuba thing is a good deal. 
</P>
<P>
	League presidents, owners, general managers, scouts and union  
executives were buzzing Monday at Jose Marti International Airport, 
talking about the Baltimore Orioles' weekend trip to Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will start talking soon about doing it again next year,''  
said former infielder Tony Bernazard, now at the players' union. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban sports officials seemed satisfied with the first visit by  
a big league team in 40 years. They appear willing to make this an 
annual event, and so do a lot of folks in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``To come down here and experience it, just to get to see and  
understand the mystique of Cuba, it was worth it,'' Montreal GM Jim 
Beattie said. ``Having done it once, the next time you won't have 
that fear or awe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all 30 major league teams sent a representative or two to  
see the Orioles beat a Cuban all-star team 3-2 in 11 innings 
Sunday. Tampa Bay Devil Rays owner Vince Naimoli hopes the trip 
helps him understand more about star pitcher Rolando Arrojo, a 
Cuban defector. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll have a conversation with him,'' Naimoli said. ``I'm a  
great student of learning by walking around, and I'll talk about 
the things I saw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig and NL president Len Coleman liked what  
they saw. So did Toronto Blue Jays scout Bob Engle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think any time you get to see guys who don't have a lot of  
exposure, it's good,'' Engle said. ``You got to see a lot of 
pitching. It gives you a good measure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With several rival scouts sitting near him waiting for a charter  
flight to Miami, Engle was hesitant to identify the Cubans he 
liked. But asked whether he thought some of them had big league 
potential, he firmly said yes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Contreras pitched eight scoreless innings, allowed only two  
hits and struck out 10. Third baseman Omar Linares, considered the 
island's best player at 32, hit a tying single in the eighth inning 
that made Cuban President Fidel Castro grin from a front-row seat 
behind the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Several top Cubans did not face Baltimore because they are  
playing in the current series between the Havana Industriales and 
Santiago for the country's league championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Industriales shortstop German Mesa, whose talent kept Rey  
Ordonez on the bench before the future Gold Glover defected and 
joined the New York Mets, may play when the Cubans visit 
Baltimore's Camden Yards on May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government has given Cuban authorities no assurances  
about players who might want to defect. Orlando ``El Duque'' 
Hernandez and Livan Hernandez are among others who have fled Cuba 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore's trip is not expected to open up opportunities for  
Cuban players to reach the majors. Instead, the game was seen as a 
way to better sportsmanship between the countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles owner Peter Angelos, who spent several years trying to  
arrange this series, was most pleased. 
</P>
<P>
	``It met and exceeded my expectations,'' he said. ``It was a  
perfect game, because we won and the Cuban team showed that they 
are capable of competing with a major league team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos and most of the major league personnel who made the trip  
got to meet Castro. Engle and some others even got an autograph 
from the 73-year-old leader, who wore a suit rather than his usual 
combat fatigues during Sunday night's reception at the national 
palace. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't like he was just shaking hands real quickly with  
everyone,'' Beattie said. ``He spoke to everyone and had something 
to talk to them about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With commissioner Bud Selig, Castro remembered his days of  
pitching while at the University of Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	``He talked about his career,'' Selig said. ``But in all honesty  
he didn't build himself up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Told that Budig was a former chancellor at Kansas, Castro was  
ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me of his interest in college basketball and was very  
much aware of the University of Kansas and its basketball 
tradition,'' Budig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon meeting Coleman, Castro talked about NL teams that once  
trained in Havana, such as the Brooklyn Dodgers and Pittsburgh. 
With Blue Jays chairman Sam Pollock, he spoke about their shared 
interest in quail hunting. 
</P>
<P>
	And what did he say to Beattie?  
</P>
<P>
	``He joked that he thought this was a baseball trip,'' the  
6-foot-5 Beattie said, ``and asked what the basketball players were 
doing here.''

	BOSTON (AP) -- Harry Sinden, the president and general manager of  
the Boston Bruins, and the U.S. women's Olympic hockey team were 
presented Tuesday with the Lester Patrick Award for outstanding 
service to hockey in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinden has been with the Bruins for more than 30 seasons,  
starting as a player-coach at the minor league level before 
advancing to head coach, then moving on to the front office. 
</P>
<P>
	As head coach, Sinden led the Bruins to the 1970 Stanley Cup  
championship. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1983 and 
the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympians earned the first-ever Olympic gold medal in  
women's hockey with their 3-0 victory over Canada in February 1998 
at Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lester Patrick Award was created in 1966 by the New York  
Rangers to honor Lester Patrick, the team's longtime general

<HEADLINE> Jazz Singer Joe Williams Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Joe Williams, whose smooth baritone and  
collaborations with Count Basie won him acclaim as one of the great 
voices of jazz, collapsed and died on a city street after walking 
away from a hospital. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams apparently died of natural causes, Clark County Coroner  
Ron Flud said. He had walked several miles Monday and was a few 
blocks from home. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Jillean, said he had been admitted to Sunrise Hospital  
a week ago for a respiratory ailment. The hospital reported 
Williams missing several hours before his body was found. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer Robert Goulet said: ``At the age of 80, Joe could sing  
better than most people at the age of 20. He was one of the 
greatest jazz and blues singers of all time, and he was such a good 
man, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' appeal stretched to other mediums: He played Bill  
Cosby's father-in-law, Grandpa Al, on ``The Cosby Show'' in the 
1980s. He and Cosby were friends, and the childhood memories 
Grandpa Al spun on the show were his own from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	But his fame was in jazz. Williams became a sensation in 1955  
when he recorded ``Everyday I Have the Blues'' with Basie, and the 
two were together for seven years. Williams repeatedly was chosen 
the top male jazz singer in readers' polls for Downbeat and other 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm most pleasantly surprised at what still comes out of my  
throat,'' Williams said in an 1986 interview. ``I'm thrilled and 
thankful. I remember Edward (Duke Ellington) saying, `I'm just a 
messenger boy for God.' Much of what we do comes through us. I 
thank God for what comes through me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born Joseph Goreed on Dec. 12, 1918, in Cordele, Ga., the  
entertainer was raised by his mother and grandmother. He found fun 
in playing the piano and singing the spirituals he heard at the 
Methodist church where his mother was the organist. 
</P>
<P>
	In his teens in the 1930s, he led the singing group The Jubilee  
Boys in performances in Chicago churches. He later sang solo in a 
Chicago club, and made his professional debut in 1937 with the late 
Jimmy Noone. 
</P>
<P>
	His big break came in 1943, when Williams was working as a  
security guard to support himself. He wound up guarding the front 
door of the Regal Theater and met jazz luminaries such as Duke 
Ellington. The Regal's manager sent Williams to the Tick Tock in 
Boston to join Lionel Hampton's band, which had its own powerhouse 
blues singer, Dinah Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The magic came with Basie. Williams said Basie hired him on the  
advice of his band.

	``Basie said, `I can't give you what you're worth. But, things  
get better for me, they get better for you.' I had the good sense 
to go with him,'' Williams recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	The two played together from 1954 to 1961, and Williams often  
performed with Basie until his death in 1984; Williams dedicated 
his renditions of ``You Are So Beautiful'' to Basie.

you want to sing, it's that you have to sing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He defined who I really am,'' Bennett said in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
	Even in his later years, Williams sang on cruise ships, at  
festivals, in hotels and clubs, working about 40 weeks a year. He 
was an avid golfer.

<HEADLINE> `Melissa' Clogs E-Mail System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A digital fingerprint used by Microsoft's Office  
programs could lead investigators to the author of the rapidly 
spreading e-mail computer virus known as ``Melissa,'' a computer 
software expert said today . 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa showed up Friday and spread rapidly around the world on  
Monday like a malicious chain letter, forcing affected computers to 
fire off dozens of infected messages to friends and colleagues and 
swamping e-mail systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Smith, president of Phar Lap Software, a small  
Cambridge, Mass., software firm that makes operating systems and 
software tools, said he thinks a virus writer who uses the handle 
``VicodinES'' wrote Melissa and distributed it Friday using an 
account stolen from America Online 15 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	VicodinES also is the name of a narcotic painkiller made by  
Knoll Laboratories. At company headquarters in Mount Olive, N.J., 
spokeswoman Linda Mayer said today that all she knows about Melissa 
is what she's read in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil engineer Scott Steinmetz, the AOL subscriber whose account  
was allegedly used by the virus maker, said he learned his name was 
associated with the virus talking with reporters Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I imagine it's cost tens of millions of dollars in lost time  
by now, and here I am associated with it, and I'm barely 
computer-literate,'' Steinmetz, of Lynnwood, Wash., told The 
Seattle Times. ``I'm having a hard time believing this is 
happening.'' He said his company was among those affected. 
</P>
<P>
	As inconvenient as Melissa is, Smith said the real danger is  
that the author is putting tool kits online that other people can 
download and create their own viruses. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could download them and someone else could use them,'' he  
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The name VicodinES also has come up in the past. A December 1997  
alert issued by Network Associates, maker of the popular Dr. 
Solomon's anti-virus program, warned of a similar virus allegedly 
created by VicodinES, called ``Anxiety.Poppy.95.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he has turned his information over to the FBI. Bill  
Carter, an FBI spokesman, would not comment on whether 
investigators had any leads. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Vatis, a federal prosecutor and director of the National  
Infrastructure Protection Center in Washington, said military and 
other government computers were among the thousands affected by the 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
	The digital fingerprint Smith used is a unique identifying  
number that Microsoft's Office suite of programs attaches to 
documents created on a specific computer. By discovering the 
computer the documents containing Melissa came from, investigators 
could presumably find the author. 
</P>
<P>
	Compounding the effects of Melissa, a similar virus called  
``Papa'' was discovered Monday. Papa sends out even more infected 
e-mail messages than Melissa, though it has a bug that sometimes 
prevents it from working, said Srivats Sampath, of McAfee, another 
maker of widely used antivirus software. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies reporting problems caused by Melissa included the  
chemical company DuPont in Wilmington, Del.; electronics maker 
Honeywell Inc. in Minneapolis; Lockheed Martin, the aerospace 
company in Bethesda, Md.; The Associated Press Broadcast Services 
in Washington, D.C.; and Compaq Computer Corp. in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Melissa virus comes in the form of an e-mail, usually  
containing the subject line ``Important Message.'' It appears to be 
from a friend or colleague. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of the e-mail message says, ``Here is that document you  
asked for ... don't show it to anyone else'' with a winking smiley 
face formed by the punctuation marks ;-). 
</P>
<P>
	Attached to the message is a Microsoft's Word document file that  
lists Internet pornography sites. Once the user opens that file, 
the virus digs into the user's Microsoft's Outlook address book and 
sends infected documents to the first 50 addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason this is spreading so rapidly is that you're getting  
it from people you know and you trust,'' said Eric Lundquist, 
editor in chief of PC Week magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should never open documents or attachments from people you  
don't know, but this is the first one you need to be careful of 
opening documents from people you do know,'' Lundquist said. 
</P>
<P>
	The OCLC Online Library Computer Center in Dublin, Ohio, a heavy  
user of the Microsoft programs, managed to detect the virus early 
and avoided trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Bob Murphy said the nonprofit computer network, which  
links 33,000 libraries around the world, warned its 800-member 
staff not to open the attachment when it was spotted by a 
technician. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were fortunate, his name started with a `B,''' Murphy said.  
</P>
<P>
	Melissa slowed Portland, Ore., city government to a crawl,  
forcing workers to resort to as handwritten memos and the 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you that we've become addicted to the e-mail  
system,'' Portland Mayor Vera Katz said. ``The phone and shouting 
have been the methods of communication. It has slowed down 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The virus forced computer managers to shut down an e-mail server  
that supplied schedules for meetings and circulates documents. The 
city has about 3,500 computers, and nearly all of them were 
infected. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even the governor of North Dakota, Ed Schafer, was immune.  
</P>
<P>
	Schafer, a frequent user of e-mail, got several of the infected  
messages Monday and opened one. It then promptly fired out the 
message to dozens of others, including first lady Nancy Jones 
Schafer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, I didn't even look at it,'' Schafer said.  
``When it jammed my computer, I was more kind of pounding on my 
keyboard, worrying about why my computer was jammed.''

<HEADLINE> Lee Says New Film Isn't a Sellout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Spike Lee says his new movie about the Son of  
Sam killer isn't a sellout. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie depicts the hunt for David Berkowitz, who killed six  
people in random shootings in 1976 and 1977. Seven other people 
were wounded in attacks that terrorized New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Berkowitz is serving life in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	Lee told students at the University of Georgia on Tuesday that  
the film isn't a diversion from his black-themed movies but a look 
at the region he loves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Black folks are saying Spike's sold out,'' he said. ``For me  
this is a New York story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie, ``Summer of Sam,'' is due out in July.

<HEADLINE> New Mexico Hoops Eyes NCAA Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- On his first day in town, newly hired  
New Mexico coach Fran Fraschilla promised to turn the Lobos' 
schedule from fast food to filet mignon. 
</P>
<P>
	``How about New Mexico-UConn?'' Fraschilla said. ``The only way  
to get to the top is to go after the guy at the top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraschilla, 40, was hired Saturday to take over a program that  
under Dave Bliss gained moderate national prominence. The Lobos 
have been to the NCAA tournament seven of the last nine years -- 
losing in the second round the past four seasons -- and have been 
ranked in the Top 25 for 54 consecutive weeks over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	But in recent seasons the Lobos also have gained notoriety for  
playing too many home games against some of the weakest teams in 
Division I. That trend hit an all-time low this season when the 
home schedule included teams like Sacramento State, Arkansas-Pine 
Bluff and Texas-Pan American. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, the constant refrain emanating from New Mexico's  
athletic department has been that the Connecticuts, Dukes and 
Michigan States aren't willing to come play New Mexico in The Pit. 
</P>
<P>
	They will, said Fraschilla, if the Lobos are also willing to  
play them at their place. And he's also counting on getting a 
little help from television. 
</P>
<P>
	``Generally, the way those kind of games are made is through  
TV,'' he said. ``I know a lot of people that don't want to come 
play here. But sometime you can get TV to twist some arms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraschilla is confident the Lobos can toughen their schedule,  
provided they're willing to sign home-and-home agreements with top 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you go on the road, you want to play the toughest  
competition that you can so that it will help you build a program 
like we want in regard to recruiting, with regard to getting ready 
for your conference and with regard to putting together a strong 
RPI (power rating) for postseason play,'' Fraschilla said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we build the program and build the schedule with it, one of  
the things I'm excited about is playing games that get us national 
attention,'' he said. ``The long term goal is to win a national 
championship. How long that will take, I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraschilla met Tuesday with the New Mexico players. Among them,  
Lamont Long, a junior who would be the Lobos' leading returning 
scorer. But Long has said he is considering leaving early to enter 
the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to have the chance to coach him because he's  
obviously going to be one of the best guards in the country next 
year,'' Fraschilla said. ``And I think the way we'll play will fit 
his style. But if he has a chance to go high in the draft, that may 
be what he and his family choose to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraschilla has six years of head coaching experience. He coached  
four years at Manhattan, taking the Jaspers to two NCAA tournaments 
and then two years at St. John's, where he led the Red Storm to the 
1998 NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	He was fired two months later and Fraschilla has said his  
interest in the then vacant job at Arizona State ``ruffled some 
feathers'' with St. John's officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Fraschilla said, he's where he belongs.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if there's a better match for me,'' he said.  
``I'm a very spiritual guy and I can tell you this has all happened 
for the best. Down the road, if you told me I'm going to stay here 
15 years and coach the Lobos and retire at 55, I'd be very happy 
with that.''

<HEADLINE> NYC Mayor Opens HillaryNo Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has a  
message for Hillary Rodham Clinton, and his Web site address says 
it all: ``HillaryNo.Com.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican mayor and the first lady may face each other in a  
race for the Senate seat being vacated next year by New York 
Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site went online during the weekend. Giuliani said that  
on Tuesday alone, the site had generated 1,100 volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last Web site that was as active was the Victoria Secrets  
website,'' the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Friends of Giuliani site opens to a photo of a smiling first  
lady with her thumbs up and the message: ``U.S. Senate: For Proven 
Leaders, Not a Proving Ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``With no governmental experience, never elected to any public  
office, her failed health care experiment under her belt, Mrs. 
Clinton now wants to be part of the Senate as we head into the next 
millennium,'' the Web site says. 
</P>
<P>
	While there was no response to e-mail or telephone messages  
seeking comment from representatives of the first lady, New York's 
state Democratic Chairwoman Judith Hope said ``the tone of the Web 
site matches the direction of the mayor's approval ratings -- 
negative, negative, negative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani's approval ratings have been falling in the wake of the  
police killing of an unarmed African immigrant, but the same polls 
show Mrs. Clinton's once substantial lead over the mayor slipping 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Teitelbaum, head of the Giuliani's ``Solutions America''  
political action committee, said the Web site ``is just going to be 
one of the many things that we use to help garner support if he in 
fact decides that the Senate is the seat he wants to pursue.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Randy Johnson, who missed his previous  
start because of a strained right groin, will pitch in a Triple-A 
game against Chicago White Sox minor leaguers Wednesday instead of 
facing the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just that if he has a physical problem over there and  
can't continue it gives us some options he wouldn't have if he 
pitches against the Rockies,'' Arizona manager Buck Showalter said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	If Johnson goes on the disabled list, it can be retroactive to  
the day after he last played in a major league spring game. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's appearance Wednesday will be his last of the spring.  
He still is scheduled to be the opening-day pitcher for the 
Diamondbacks against Kevin Brown at Dodger Stadium next Monday.

<HEADLINE> Brown Deal To Be Costly to Dodgers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Making Kevin Brown a jet-setter is going to cost  
the Los Angeles Dodgers even more than $105 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitcher's private planes are being treated as plain old cash  
as far as the commissioner's office is concerned, and the team will 
have to pay an extra $204,000 in luxury tax this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner's office has proposed adding $600,000 to  
Brown's listed salary in each season of his $105 million, 
seven-year contract. That's because Brown's contract contains a 
unique clause allowing the use of a private jet -- at the team's 
expense -- 12 times a year so his family can travel from Los Angeles 
or Macon, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a letter sent to the Dodgers from the  
commissioner's office, the price of the Brown family's upgrade from 
first class to private plane is estimated to be worth $50,000 per 
round trip. It will be assessed at 34 percent rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's contract also calls for him to receive eight season  
tickets, and the commissioner's office has asked the Dodgers for 
the value of those tickets with the intention of also adding that 
figure to his salary for luxury tax purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Dodgers won't be charged extra for giving Brown a  
hotel suite on road trips. He is among several players with that 
provision in his contract -- the latest to get one is Orel Hershiser 
when he signed with the New York Mets last week. 
</P>
<P>
	If Dodger Stadium is remodeled, Brown would receive the free use  
of a luxury suite. If that happens, an extra charge would be added 
to his salary for luxury tax purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Johnson, who signed a $52.4 million, four-year contract  
with Arizona, gets a luxury suite as part of his deal, and the 
commissioner's office is adding it to the Diamondbacks' payroll, 
saying it is worth $95,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's free pair of season tickets for the Phoenix Suns, also  
headed by Diamondbacks owner Jerry Colangelo, also is being tacked 
on the payroll, at a cost of $13,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets' payroll is being charged an additional $95,000 a  
season for the luxury suite the team is giving to catcher Mike 
Piazza as part of his $91 million, seven-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles is expected to have the highest payroll in the major  
league this season for luxury tax purposes, nearly $5 million more 
than second-place Baltimore, according to February estimates. 
Unlike regular payroll calculations, which used the yearly salary 
plus a prorated share of the signing bonus, the luxury tax is 
calculated based on the average annual value of the entire 
contract, and the entire 40-man roster is used. 
</P>
<P>
	Complete luxury tax estimates aren't expected for a week or two.  
The actual tax will be based on final figures compiled in December 
and will be assessed in January 2000.

	No Breakthrough in Yugoslav Talks  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Six hours of talks between Russia's  
prime minister and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic today 
produced no immediate sign of a breakthrough that might halt NATO 
airstrikes on Serb forces. ITAR-Tass quoted Yevgeny Primakov as 
saying ``Belgrade is ready to settle all the questions by political 
means ... and reduce its military presence in Kosovo'' if the NATO 
bombing stops. NATO has called for a cessation of all attacks on 
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians and Milosevic's acceptance of a 
peacekeeping force in Kosovo under NATO leadership as conditions 
for stopping the airstrikes. 

</P>
<P>
	French Officials Say Yugoslavia Hurt  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- French military officials say  
Yugoslavia's air defenses have taken a major hit from NATO attacks. 
French Defense Minister Alain Richard says the airstrikes have 
seriously diminished Yugoslavia's capacity to strike and defend 
itself by air. Richard says more than 50 percent of the Yugoslav 
air defense and air combat potential has been knocked out. 

</P>
<P>
	Albanians Still Fleeing Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO officials say the flow of  
ethnic Albanian refugees out of Kosovo isn't slowing down. They 
estimate the number of Albanians who have left the embattled Serb 
province since NATO attacks began on Yugoslavia last week is up to 
118,000. International monitor claim one city in western Kosovo is 
``almost totally destroyed.'' NATO said it had received reports 
that Yugoslav military forces had opened fire with tanks and 
artillery at refugees in the Pagarusa Valley. The upheaval 
stretches the ability of overburdened neighbors -- Albania, 
Macedonia and Montenegro -- to care for them.

	Economy Extends Retirement Programs  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The strong economy has delayed the projected  
insolvency date of the Medicare trust fund by seven years, to 2015, 
and the Social Security fund by two years, to 2034, the Clinton 
administration said today. It is the second consecutive year that 
stronger-than-expected economic growth has added new years of life 
to the retirement programs. The Social Security insolvency date, 
which was extended last year from 2029 to 2032, was moved in the 
latest projection to 2034. The good news might take pressure off 
lawmakers to order reforms for the retirement programs.

mainland, where they then must fight for clearance to come back. 
The government and 17 immigrants are fighting over how to interpret 
a January ruling by Hong Kong's highest court that anybody with at 
least one Hong Kong parent has the right to live in the territory. 
The government fears the decision will open a floodgate to hundreds 
of thousands of immigrants who could overwhelm Hong Kong's health,

<HEADLINE> GM Makes 1-Million-Vehicle Recall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- General Motors Corp. is recalling about 1  
million pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles to change the 
wiring that ensures the brake lights flash when motorists stop or 
slow down, the company said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall covers all full-size Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks  
and full-size sport utility vehicles from the 1994 model year 
including the Chevrolet C-K pickup truck, the Suburban and Blazer 
SUVs, GMC Sierra pickup truck and Suburban and Yukon SUVs, GM said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also is recalling some chassis cabs based on the  
full-size pickup platform. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1 million of the vehicles are being recalled because the  
wiring was reversed on the brake switch from what was specified on 
a brake switch design drawing, according to GM and a federal safety 
agency that oversees recalls, the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	With the reversed wiring, the brake switch will work but could  
wear out prematurely, resulting in a loss of brake lights that warn 
other drivers when a motorist is slowing down or stopping, NHTSA 
and GM officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would fail to warn a following driver that the vehicle is  
braking and could lead to a crash,'' a NHTSA report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of the vehicles will be notified next month to bring them  
in so the wiring can be fixed and the brake switch replaced at no 
cost to customers, GM said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM spokeswoman Mia Walton said the company had no reports of  
crash injuries from brake switch failure.

<HEADLINE> Long-Time Texas Inmate Executed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Texas' longest-imprisoned death row  
inmate was executed by injection Tuesday for using a stolen machine 
gun to kill a rural grocery store owner, one of four people slain 
during a crime spree almost 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Excell White, 61, nicknamed ``Excell the Executioner'' by  
police, had been on death row since Aug. 26, 1974, longer than any 
of the 452 condemned men and women in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	White's final words were, ``Send me to my maker, warden.''  
Minutes earlier, he told a prison official, ``Well, you finally got 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the some 3,600 prisoners awaiting execution in the United  
States, only three other men -- two in Georgia and one in Florida -- 
have been on death row longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a long time,'' said Tom O'Connell, the prosecutor  
who won the capital murder conviction and death sentence. He then 
tried White a second time in 1987 after an appeals court overturned 
the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	After a dozen years on death row, his conviction was thrown out  
because he was not warned information he told state psychiatrists 
could be used against him. He was convicted again in 1987 and the 
appeals process, which averages about 10 years for Texas death row 
inmates, began anew. 
</P>
<P>
	White killed a 73-year-old grocery store owner and two  
18-year-old customers in May 1974. The day before the slayings, he 
fatally stabbed a gun collector. White wasn't tried for the other 
slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	White was the ninth inmate executed in Texas this year and also  
was older than any of the 172 prisoners who preceded him to the 
Texas death chamber since the state resumed capital punishment in 
1982.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Reaches Efficiency Milestone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A Boeing Co. efficiency program with a name that  
could cure insomnia has reached another milestone toward proving 
its potency. 
</P>
<P>
	This month 8,000 employees -- chiefly engineers -- were brought  
into a new, streamlined system for designing and building 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	That brings the total to 38,000 workers in eight states, Canada  
and Australia with access to four interconnected computer systems 
that are replacing more than 450 separate and sometimes 
incompatible networks in Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Material from one computer system sometimes had to be printed  
out for reinput into another, and even top managers had access only 
to some of the systems, said Garnet Hizzey, deputy director of the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest change should cut the time required for design and  
production of airplane parts by roughly 75 percent, Hizzey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cristina McHugh, a company spokeswoman, said no jobs are in  
jeopardy from the program: Define and Control Airplane 
Configuration-Manufacturing Resource Management, or DCAC-MRM. 
</P>
<P>
	``These initiatives are for eliminating waste, not people,'' she  
said. ``Hopefully, they'll be effective in reducing costs and make 
our jobs more secure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first seven phases of the overhaul, which began in February  
1996, covered production workers who built parts and assemblies. 
</P>
<P>
	This phase covers engineers who design parts. The next phase  
covers engineers who make design drawings for parts in basic 
assemblies and more complex installations, and the last two phases 
are for production workers in Boeing airplane factories in Everett, 
Renton and Long Beach, Calif. Completion is scheduled for the first 
quarter of 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent change covers parts as simple as a bracket for  
an overhead panel in a 747 jumbojet, speeding the arrival of the 
product definition and specifications into the factory. 
</P>
<P>
	With the new system, that bracket can now be in the hands of  
assembly crews within 20 days after the need for it is determined, 
compared with 80 days under the old system, Hizzey said. 
</P>
<P>
	For a rush order, it might be five days instead of 20.  
</P>
<P>
	Even parts as basic as brackets frequently are redesigned to  
satisfy airline demands for custom interior cabins, Hizzey 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
	One goal of the program is to make information on each  
custom-made part, component and assembly more widely available so 
more can be reused, rather than redesigned each time a request is 
made, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We endeavor to use as many common parts as possible,'' he  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	With more standardized assembly, Hizzey said, ``we could pump  
out airplanes like beer cans.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Chief Declines Senate Invite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Olympics' top official declined a Senate  
invitation Tuesday to testify how the IOC is dealing with its 
corruption scandal, a move one congressional leader said did little 
to lift the ``dark cloud'' over the games. 
</P>
<P>
	As elite sponsors met with Olympic marketers to hear about  
reforms and ask for ``concessions for damage'' from the scandal, 
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch told the Senate Commerce 
Committee that he was unable to attend hearings April 14 on the 
Salt Lake City bribery case. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch gave no reason for declining the invitation and said  
he hoped Anita DeFrantz, an IOC vice president from Los Angeles, 
would be allowed to take his place. 
</P>
<P>
	``We share your concern on the need of reform for the  
International Olympic Committee and want to assure you that we are 
deeply committed to restoring the integrity of the Olympic 
ideals,'' he said in a letter to Sen. John McCain, the Commerce 
Committee chairman. ``The IOC has taken serious action to deal with 
the past and intends to continue to work with a number of people, 
including yourself, to set the IOC on the right course for the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who has been critical of Samaranch and the IOC since the  
scandal broke late last year, said he was ``deeply saddened'' that 
the top leader of the Olympics had passed up a chance to explain 
``the reform and ethics initiatives of the organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently, Mr. Samaranch doesn't understand the gravity of  
the situation for the future of the Olympic movement,'' McCain said 
in a statement from his Washington office. ``The lack of 
transparency and accountability within the IOC, that fostered a 
culture based on gifts and lavish travel, has brought a dark cloud 
over the integrity of the Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation is pending that would hit the IOC squarely in its  
bank account, stripping tax breaks from the panel and its 
sponsorship deals and rerouting billions of television dollars to 
the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, an Arizona Republican with presidential aspirations,  
said his committee ``must now move forward, unfortunately without 
Mr. Samaranch's direct input, to ensure that urgently needed 
reforms are implemented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate hearings were among the topics discussed during a  
2 1/2-hour meeting in New York between the IOC's 11 biggest sponsors 
and its chief commercial leaders, vice president Dick Pound and 
marketing director Michael Payne. 
</P>
<P>
	No ringing endorsement was issued by the sponsors in the first  
meeting since an emergency IOC assembly expelled six delegates and 
set the framework for what the committee hopes will be watershed 
reforms to its structure and membership. 
</P>
<P>
	But there also was no repeat of the sharp criticism of the last  
meeting with sponsors in mid-February, when boardroom concerns over 
the scandal's impact on the ``halo effect'' of Olympic sponsorship 
were repeated loud and clear. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a much better meeting,'' Pound said. ``It didn't have  
the sense of discomfort, unease and suspicion. ... My impression is 
that they feel we do have a blueprint that looks sensible. We now 
have to build according to that plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsor representatives who attended the meeting agreed that the  
atmosphere was more relaxed and conciliatory than a month ago. But 
the representatives, all speaking on condition of anonymity, said 
the focus was business, not internal change. 
</P>
<P>
	They said Pound and Payne were told by four companies that  
concern remained in executive suites over the scandal and, for the 
first time, were asked about how the IOC might make ``concessions 
for the damage'' to their $50 million investments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was total bottom line,'' one official said. ``They were  
told, `We are having problems getting Olympic budgets and programs 
through because you haven't given us enough ammunition to prove it 
(the scandal) is fixed. So how are you going to make it up to 
us?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Another representative said the sponsors were not seeking  
rebates but instead wanted ``items of marketing value,'' such as 
increased access to street ad space around the 2000 Games in 
Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsor officials all said there was no direct response from  
Pound or Payne. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said the sponsors had been concerned that ``the event of  
the last three months had slowed down the internal allocation of 
resources, a `Why don't we wait and see what's happening before 
doing X or Y for Sydney or Salt Lake.' 
</P>
<P>
	``They've probably lost 3-4 months on that but there's still  
plenty of time to do things. I believe if they report in their 
internal process that these things are happening, that goes away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 40 people from all 11 corporations in the top-level program  
-- Coca-Cola, Eastman Kodak, VISA, Xerox, Sports Illustrated, 
Panasonic, McDonald's, IBM, UPS, John Hancock and Samsung -- 
attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on hand was a USOC delegation headed by marketing chief  
John Krimsky, who was not at the February meeting but said the 
committee was ``gratified'' to be invited this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel it is essential, with nine of the 11 top sponsors  
coming from the United States, that the USOC is represented and 
will be represented at every one of these meetings,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Coke Sales Volume Down in Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A Coca-Cola Co. disclosure that worldwide sales  
volume slipped in the first quarter sent the company's stock 
skidding in late trading Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the announcement come while the New York Stock Exchange was  
still open, it could have prevented the Dow Jones industrial 
average from making its first close above 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Continued economic problems in markets in Asia, Russia, South  
Africa, Germany and parts of eastern Europe and Latin America have 
been undercutting Coke sales since mid-1998. The company usually 
meets annual volume growth targets of 7 percent to 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke projected a 1 percent to 2 percent decline in unit case  
volume for the first quarter of 1999, after reporting a 14 percent 
increase in 1998's first quarter. The company's unit case volume 
was up 6 percent for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Unit case volume is a key industry indicator that is defined as  
sales of 24 eight-ounce servings. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke, one of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow industrials, was  
up $1.87 1/2 at $67.18 3/4 a share when the NYSE closed at 4 p.m. EST and 
the Dow industrials finished at a record 10,006.78. 
</P>
<P>
	But a few minutes later, with the disclosure of the sales drop,  
Coke stock sank, finishing the day down 50 cents at $64.81 1/4 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	That drop of $2.37 1/2 from the close on the NYSE was the  
equivalent of a decline of more than 10 points in the Dow, or 
enough to have left the indicator below 10,000 if it had happened a 
few minutes earlier.

<HEADLINE> Weapons Labs' Security Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three of the government's 12 nuclear weapons  
facilities, including the weapons laboratory at Los Alamos, 
received a less than satisfactory security rating for last year, 
the Energy Department disclosed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A report sent to Congress said the Los Alamos National  
Laboratory, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and a 
department transportation facility continued to demonstrate 
shortcomings in security. 
</P>
<P>
	The three facilities received a ``marginal'' security evaluation  
as opposed to ``satisfactory'' for the other nine facilities, 
according to the report, which was released after classified 
portions were deleted. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Alamos has been the focus of a three-year espionage  
investigation stemming from concerns that top-secret warhead 
material at the facility may have fallen into Chinese hands during 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, a Los Alamos computer scientist who was the  
object of the FBI investigation was fired for security breaches, 
although he has not been charged with any crime. The Los Alamos 
case has prompted members of Congress to call for an overhaul of 
security at the federal weapons laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	The report to Congress also expressed concern about the  
difficulty protecting secrets in an era of the Internet. New 
guidelines are being developed to evaluate the impact on security 
because of the ``voluminous'' data available through ``the vast 
array of ... DOE web sites,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said he planned to use an extra  
$8 million he has requested from Congress for security to create 
better ``fire walls'' and intrusion detection devices in the 
department's classified and unclassified computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	In releasing the unclassified version of the report, Richardson  
said that while a ``marginal'' rating indicates some security 
shortcomings, nuclear materials and sensitive information continue 
to be protected. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report projects that all facilities will reach an overall  
satisfactory rating in 1999 if the present corrective actions 
already underway continue on their present course,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The heavily censored report provided no details of the security  
lapses cited. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Alamos laboratory received a less than satisfactory mark  
in four of the five categories: information security, including 
protection of classified material; operation of security systems; 
physical security; nuclear material control and accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	The reported predicted continued problems this year for Los  
Alamos in information security. The laboratory received its only 
``satisfactory'' rating in the area of personnel security, 
including access authorization and visitor control. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that while there were improvements in Los  
Alamos' management ``focus and attention to safeguards and security 
... a number of serious protection issues ... (still) needed to be 
addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, Calif.,  
failed to received an overall satisfactory rating primarily because 
of severe problems that previously have been raised publicly about 
poor accountability of nuclear weapons material at the lab. 
</P>
<P>
	These material accounting and inventory problems reflected  
``such severe deficiencies ... to warrant an overall facility 
rating of marginal,'' the report said. It anticipated that 
Livermore would be given a satisfactory rating this year.

<HEADLINE>  UConn Defies the Doubters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- UConn? UCan.  
</P>
<P>
	The UConn Huskies are a blue-collar team that supposedly didn't  
have a chance against a blue-chip Duke team that felt so confident 
it didn't even practice the day before the biggest game of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But it turned out to be a Blue Monday for Duke, thanks to an  
unruffled Connecticut team that didn't leave its A-game on St. Pete 
Beach -- and a bench that was presumably far inferior to the Blue 
Devils'. 
</P>
<P>
	With coach Jim Calhoun yo-yoing players in and out of the game  
as if they were on an invisible string, the Huskies outworked, 
outplayed and outhustled -- outcoached, too -- a team that was being 
fitted for its championship rings weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Final score: Connecticut 77, Duke 74.  
</P>
<P>
	``The kids truly believed this was possible, even when the folks  
around us -- and I was leading the parade -- were saying how good 
Duke was,'' Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if we ever played a better game,'' Kevin Freeman  
said. ``But this is the best of the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, the stars came out for the Huskies, as Richard Hamilton  
scored 27 points, Ricky Moore transformed from defensive stopper to 
offensive sparkplug with 13 first-half points and Khalid El-Amin 
ran an offense that never wasted a single possession. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to shock the world,'' said Moore, whose tight defense  
forced Trajan Langdon to travel on Duke's final possession. 
</P>
<P>
	The world is suitably shocked.  
</P>
<P>
	But the Huskies are national champions in great part because  
their bench players weren't content to play minor roles, outscoring 
a Duke bench loaded with four McDonald's All-Americans 17-8. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies also outrebounded Duke 41-31, with Player of the  
Year Elton Brand getting 13 -- as many as he had in the first half 
Saturday against Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a team that wanted to be the best, and to do that we  
had to beat the best,'' Calhoun said. ``We knew it was possible 
because we hadn't played our best game yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jake Voskuhl, the 6-foot-11 center whose coifed hair never  
ruffled even amid a frantic Duke second half comeback, banged and 
clanged all night with Brand, who worked overly hard for each of 
his 15 points and got off only eight shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the first half, they made it really tough to give me open  
looks,'' Brand said. ``They were fighting the possession every time 
I touched it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To keep the foul-prone Voskuhl in the game, Calhoun began  
substituting three minutes into the game, running players in and 
out so quickly that some of the Huskies' best fast breaks came in 
front of the scorer's table. Nine UConn players played at least 
seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmund Saunders, more of a tight end than a power forward, came  
in to contribute valuable minutes and a physical presence that 
threw Brand off his game, and Souleymane Wane spelled Voskuhl with 
key minutes and four very-important points. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe the Blue Devils left their game in the night clubs where  
many of the Blue Devils were seen reveling at 3 a.m. Sunday after 
the semifinals, only nine hours before a practice that was never 
held because coach Mike Krzyzewski felt they already were ready. 
</P>
<P>
	They weren't ready for this.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Duke's been in a tight game like that in a long  
time. They haven't been challenged in close games all year, but we 
win in close games,'' said Freeman, who helped double-team Brand. 
``We wanted to prove we are the best team in the country and we 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke, the team that usually intimidates, finally ran into an  
opponent that didn't back down. Wane once stared down Brand as the 
two ran down the court, and Voskuhl seemed to get into Brand's mind 
-- and, once, into his shirt, almost tugging him to the ground while 
nearly tearing off his jersey as he protectively guarded the 
baseline. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great team defense,'' Voskuhl said. ``We got help from  
everyone and everywhere. ... We had a great game plan and we stuck 
to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the so-called Duke Invitational turned out to be the UConn  
Vindication. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies had never before reached the Final Four in 20  
previous trips to the NCAA tournament, and Calhoun, a Division I 
coach for 27 years, was known as one of the best coaches to never 
get to the round of four. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's the final one.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm no better coach than I was three weeks ago,'' Calhoun  
said. ``I said I didn't need a Final Four, as badly as I wanted to 
get there. But that guy you hear yelling tonight? That will be 
me.''

ran an offense that never wasted a single possession. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to shock the world,'' said Moore, whose tight defense  
forced Trajan Langdon to travel on Duke's final possession. 
</P>
<P>
	The world is suitably shocked.  
</P>
<P>
	But the Huskies are national champions in great part because  
their bench players weren't content to play minor roles, outscoring 
a Duke bench loaded with four McDonald's All-Americans 17-8. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies also outrebounded Duke 41-31, with Player of the  
Year Elton Brand getting 13 -- as many as he had in the first half 
Saturday against Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a team that wanted to be the best, and to do that we  
had to beat the best,'' Calhoun said. ``We knew it was possible 
because we hadn't played our best game yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jake Voskuhl, the 6-foot-11 center whose coifed hair never  
ruffled even amid a frantic Duke second half comeback, banged and 
clanged all night with Brand, who worked overly hard for each of 
his 15 points and got off only eight shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the first half, they made it really tough to give me open  
looks,'' Brand said. ``They were fighting the possession every time 
I touched it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To keep the foul-prone Voskuhl in the game, Calhoun began  
substituting three minutes into the game, running players in and 
out so quickly that some of the Huskies' best fast breaks came in 
front of the scorer's table. Nine UConn players played at least 
seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmund Saunders, more of a tight end than a power forward, came  
in to contribute valuable minutes and a physical presence that 
threw Brand off his game, and Souleymane Wane spelled Voskuhl with 
key minutes and four very-important points. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe the Blue Devils left their game in the night clubs where  
many of the Blue Devils were seen reveling at 3 a.m. Sunday after 
the semifinals, only nine hours before a practice that was never 
held because coach Mike Krzyzewski felt they already were ready. 
</P>
<P>
	They weren't ready for this.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Duke's been in a tight game like that in a long  
time. They haven't been challenged in close games all year, but we 
win in close games,'' said Freeman, who helped double-team Brand. 
``We wanted to prove we are the best team in the country and we 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke, the team that usually intimidates, finally ran into an  
opponent that didn't back down. Wane once stared down Brand as the 
two ran down the court, and Voskuhl seemed to get into Brand's mind 
-- and, once, into his shirt, almost tugging him to the ground while 
nearly tearing off his jersey as he protectively guarded the 
baseline. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great team defense,'' Voskuhl said. ``We got help from  
everyone and everywhere. ... We had a great game plan and we stuck 
to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the so-called Duke Invitational turned out to be the UConn  
Vindication. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies had never before reached the Final Four in 20  
previous trips to the NCAA tournament, and Calhoun, a Division I 
coach for 27 years, was known as one of the best coaches to never 
get to the round of four. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's the final one.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm no better coach than I was three weeks ago,'' Calhoun  
said. ``I said I didn't need a Final Four, as badly as I wanted to 
get there. But that guy you hear yelling tonight? That will be 
me.''

<HEADLINE>  Cal Ripken Sr. Is Buried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABERDEEN, Md. (AP) -- Cal Ripken Sr. was remembered as a loving  
father and a dedicated teacher Tuesday during an emotional funeral 
service that broke sharply with the stoic public image of the 
Ripken family. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Cal Ripken Jr. and his brother Bill wept openly as they  
eulogized their father, who died Thursday of lung cancer at age 63. 
Both played for Cal Sr. during his years as a coach and when he 
managed the Orioles in 1987 and part of the 1988 season. 
</P>
<P>
	In the most touching moment of the ceremony, Cal Jr., whose  
record consecutive games streak of 2,632 is seen as a model of 
strength and perseverance, hugged and consoled his daughter Mariah 
as she read a tearful good-bye message to ``Pop Pop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People say we were not an emotional family,'' Cal Jr. said as  
he wiped aside his own tears. ``Maybe we've changed that today. We 
did not have a lot of exchanges -- a handshake, a look. We didn't 
say `I love you' all the time, but we all knew that we loved each 
other. In the hospital, we said it enough times to last a lifetime. 
Dad, we love you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Jr. wept again as he recalled the first day he took his own  
son Ryan to the ballpark to impart for the first time the pregame 
rituals and traditions Cal Sr. had preserved and passed on to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``How he loved putting on his uniform,'' Cal Jr. recalled. ``He  
was never happier than when he was wearing that uniform. It was the 
hardest thing for him to take off at the end of the day. He called 
it his work clothes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Ripken also bared his emotions as he recalled how his  
father's work ethic and sense of pride were embodied the Ripken 
family. In addition to Cal Jr. and Bill, Cal Sr. also had a son, 
Fred, and daughter, Ellen. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 300 people filled the Grace United Methodist Church.  
</P>
<P>
	The mourners included Orioles principal owner Peter Angelos,  
Orioles players B.J. Surhoff and Harold Baines, coaches Elrod 
Hendricks and Eddie Murray, and former Orioles pitcher Scott 
McGregor. Ripken Sr. was also eulogized by Baltimore lawyer and 
sports agent Ron Shapiro, state Sen. Robert Hooper and former 
Orioles coach Jimmy Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	He was buried in Bakers Cemetery at Aberdeen.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks To Help Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is looking for other ways to  
help farmers, but major changes to federal farm law are unlikely 
this year, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments come as farmers prepare for the new planting  
season, which is expected to bring low prices for the second year 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we'd like to do is be out a little more in front of the  
issue,'' Glickman said Tuesday, adding that President Clinton 
telephoned him over the weekend to discuss farm issues. ``The 
issues of the farm program are getting a lot more attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Glickman warned that it is unlikely there will be major  
revisions to the 1996 farm law that gradually phases out government 
subsidies to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any movement to roll back the Farm Bill,''  
Glickman said. ``But I do think it's imperative that we plug its 
holes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the administration will likely put forth some specific  
proposals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Clinton administration and Congress have expressed  
interest in overhauling a crop insurance program for farmers so 
that producers will have adequate coverage during hard times. But 
crop insurance isn't the only solution, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``While crop insurance will continue to be the centerpiece of  
the safety net, we're looking at a broad range of risk management 
tools,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, Congress passed a $6 billion emergency aid package  
for farmers. The money came as farmers were experiencing record low 
prices along with disease and bad weather in some areas. The 
government already has predicted the low price problem will linger 
this year, largely due to the Asian economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Low prices also have hit the livestock sector, particularly hog  
farmers who have gotten their lowest prices in four decades in the 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of Congress already have expressed support for  
another emergency aid package for farmers.

<HEADLINE> Subaru, Infiniti Unveil New Models </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Redesigned sedans from Japanese automakers  
Subaru and Infiniti and a high-performance coupe from Sweden's Saab 
were among the new models introduced at the New York International 
Auto Show's media preview. 
</P>
<P>
	The North American version of the 2000 Legacy is slightly wider  
but very similar in design to its sister car sold in Japan, which 
went on sale last year. They are larger inside and out than their 
predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Legacy sedan and wagon built near Lafayette, Ind., go on  
sale in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Infiniti, the luxury division of Nissan Motor Co., said its 2000  
I-30 sedan will go on sale by September. The Infiniti shares its 
chassis and major parts with the Nissan Maxima; the new version has 
a substantially different body design. 
</P>
<P>
	The redesigned I-30 features a safety system that moves the  
seat's head restraint up and forward in a rear-end collision to 
help prevent whiplash; it returns to its normal position after the 
crash. Nissan says tests show it can substantially reduce the 
threat of neck injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The system, made by Lear Corp., also will be standard on the  
2000 Q45 sedan and may be extended to other Nissan vehicles in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan also has upgraded the I-30's 3-liter V6 engine to produce  
227 horsepower. The front-drive sedan is built in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Saab's 9-3 Viggen is named after a Saab-built jet fighter. With  
lots of extra body cladding and a 2.3-liter, turbocharged, 
high-output four-cylinder engine that generates 225 horsepower, the 
9-3 Viggen will be produced in limited numbers for select dealers. 
It goes on sale in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swedish automaker is half-owned by General Motors Corp.  
</P>
<P>
	The preview took place Tuesday. The show opens to the public  
Saturday and runs through April 11.

<HEADLINE> Hate Crimes Up in California Suburb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANCASTER, Calif. (AP) -- This white-flight Los Angeles suburb of  
perpetual sun, affordable houses and streets lined with palm trees 
is now attracting large numbers of blacks and Hispanics, and the 
mix has proved combustible. 
</P>
<P>
	Lancaster, considered one of the safest cities in America, has  
counted seven hate incidents so far this year, and minority 
residents are on edge. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, in the most recent incident, two men accused of  
belonging to a neo-Nazi group attacked a 20-year-old black man with 
a hammer in the parking lot of the Wal-Mart after he spoke to a 
white woman. He suffered minor shoulder injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't like the fact the community is changing,'' said  
Assistant U.S. Attorney Mike Gennaco, who has prosecuted members of 
the Nazi Lowriders, who have been blamed for most of the incidents. 
``Whenever you have transitional neighborhoods, there are 
tensions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Lancaster, a city of 127,000 northwest of Los  
Angeles, portray the violence as the work of a disenchanted few. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the Nazi Lowriders, a statewide skinhead gang, have  
200 to 300 members in the Lancaster area, many of them recruited in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, three young whites fired a gun into a car carrying  
three black men and an 11-month-old baby. One man was grazed, and 
the baby was hurt by broken glass. In two incidents a year later, 
blacks were attacked with a baseball bat and a machete. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a small group, but they are making a big impact,''  
said Gerry Green, a 38-year-old black nurse. ``I'm afraid things 
will get worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the most recent year for which figures were available,  
the FBI reported 17 race bias incidents in Lancaster. Only six 
cities in California had more, but their populations were at least 
three times as large. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise of the Nazi Lowriders in the Lancaster area is seen as  
a direct response to the region's new diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a California story. This is a story that plays out  
all over the world,'' said Martin Krieger, a professor of urban 
planning at the University of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	The city is the heart of Antelope Valley, home to Edwards Air  
Force Base. About 30 miles of sandy, barren mountains separate it 
from downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, Lancaster was a town of about 48,000 people, most of  
them connected in some way to Edwards. During the '80s, its 
population boomed as whites left Los Angeles, and by 1990 it had a 
population 97,000. But during the '90s, a more diverse mix of 
people began moving to town. 
</P>
<P>
	Lancaster grew 26.6 percent from 1990 to 1997, attracting people  
with housing that is cheaper than other parts of Los Angeles 
County. During that time, the proportion of blacks almost 
quadrupled to 11 percent, according to the county Community 
Development Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, minorities were nearly a fourth of the population in  
1997, up from 14 percent in 1990, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The community seems pained by the racial trouble.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, a 25-member community task force put up  
billboards saying ``Not in Our Valley,'' sponsored school essay 
contests on diversity, set up a hate-crime hot line, and organized 
an informal network to exchange information on Nazi Lowriders' 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are blacks that feel uncomfortable. But they know there  
is no question that the city is doing all we can,'' said the Rev. 
Henry Hearns, vice mayor and a black community leader. 
</P>
<P>
	That sentiment is echoed in the streets.  
</P>
<P>
	The skinheads ``see our change in diversity as a threat,'' said  
John Kolesar, a white schoolteacher who is puzzled by the attacks 
in a city the FBI ranks in the top fifth of big cities for safety. 
``We see them as people blaming someone else for their own 
problems.''

<HEADLINE> Driver Survives Train Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANDERSON, Ind. (AP) -- A car was rear-ended into the side of a  
moving freight train and dragged for at least 3 1/2 miles as the 
driver used her cellular phone to frantically call for help. 
</P>
<P>
	Amber Scott escaped with only minor injuries in Monday morning's  
accident. ``She was very, very lucky,'' Madison County sheriff's 
Maj. Ron Richardson said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conrail train, its crew unaware of her plight, dragged Ms.  
Scott's car until the car apparently hit a railroad sign at another 
crossing and was jarred loose from the train. 
</P>
<P>
	When rescuers finally found the 19-year-old woman, her car was  
demolished but she had suffered only cuts, bumps and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	``I prayed to the Lord all the way down the track,'' Ms. Scott  
told Indianapolis television station WTHR. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scott was stopped at a railroad crossing, on her way to  
classes at Ball State University, when a pickup truck hit her from 
behind in the fog, Richardson said. The impact sent her car 
directly into the train's side. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no way of seeing these things. When our engineer went  
by, the car was sitting there'' at the crossing, Conrail spokesman 
Ron Hildebrand said from the rail company's offices in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for Ms. Scott started after the pickup's driver, Ross  
K. Schroeder, 25, told deputies there had been a car in front of 
him at the crossing and that it had disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, as the train was pushing her car down the tracks, Ms.  
Scott dialed 911 on her cell phone. Police dispatchers could hear a 
woman screaming for help and the sound of a train in the 
background, Sheriff Terry Richwine said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some guy has hit me,'' she shrieks on the 911 tape. ``And I'm  
being dragged by a, by a train. Oh, please help!'' 
</P>
<P>
	She couldn't clearly hear the dispatcher's questions and  
eventually the call cut off. Ms. Scott also called her mother, 
Patricia Scott, on the phone, managing to cry out only, ``Mom! Mom! 
I've been hit!'' before the call broke off, the mother said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Two high school boys alerted authorities after they saw the car  
being dragged. Ms. Scott was standing outside her wrecked car when 
rescuers arrived. She was taken to St. John's Medical Center for 
treatment and released. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder suffered cuts on his hands but declined medical  
treatment at the scene. He was cited for driving without insurance, 
Richwine said. 
</P>
<P>
	The train was traveling 29 mph when the accident happened, the  
Conrail spokesman said. At that speed, it would have taken roughly 
seven minutes for the car to be dragged 3 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just had visions of another serious accident,'' Hildebrand  
said. ``She's really lucky she wasn't seriously injured.''

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Lawsuit Dismissed Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell isn't giving up a  
challenge to his 68-game suspension for choking coach P.J. 
Carlesimo, despite a federal judge's finding that the suit was a 
misuse of the court system. 
</P>
<P>
	Undaunted by a court order requiring him to pay the court costs  
of the NBA and the Golden State Warriors in getting the case 
dismissed, Sprewell will ask the 9th U.S. Circuit of Appeals to 
reinstate it, attorney Robert Thompson Jr. said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Latrell's made the decision to appeal because he believes  
strongly in his case,'' Thompson said from Atlanta. ``We're very 
confident about the results on appeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the NBA said Sprewell should be grateful for the  
results of the arbitration that he is challenging in his suit. The 
arbitrator cut Sprewell's suspension from a year to 68 games, the 
remainder of the 1997-98 season, and overturned the Warriors' 
decision to terminate the last three years of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``For choking the head coach the way he did, he should have been  
charged with a crime,'' league attorney Frank Rothman said. ``I 
think he got off very light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $30 million suit accused the arbitrator of exceeding his  
authority in allowing both the Warriors and the NBA to punish 
Sprewell. The suit also claimed racial discrimination, noting that 
Phoenix Suns forward Tom Chambers, who is white, was not suspended 
for punching an assistant coach a few weeks before Sprewell 
attacked Carlesimo. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker first dismissed the suit last  
July, saying its factual claims were too vague to prove any legal 
violations. He said Sprewell should consider dropping the case, but 
gave him one more chance to make his allegations more specific. 
</P>
<P>
	In a ruling made public Monday, Walker said the refiled suit was  
virtually the same as the first, meritless suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell's ``second baseless (suit) forced unnecessary  
expenditures by defendants (the NBA and the Warriors) and a 
wasteful diversion of this court's resources,'' Walker said. He 
invited the league and the team to submit statements of their 
attorneys' fees and expenses for the dismissal motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, a former All-Star guard, argued with Carlesimo during  
a practice in December 1997, then grabbed him around the neck and 
threatened to kill him, according to witnesses at his arbitration 
hearing. After they were separated and Sprewell left the floor to 
shower and change, he returned and, according to witnesses, punched 
Carlesimo and threatened him again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Warriors initially suspended him for 10 games, then  
terminated the last three years and $24 million of his contract. 
The league increased the suspension to a year. But arbitrator John 
Feerick, after a lengthy hearing, ruled the punishment excessive 
and ordered Sprewell reinstated last July 1. He was later traded to 
the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell said the 68-game suspension cost him $6.4 million in  
salary. His suit sought the return of $5.4 million as well as 
additional damages. 
</P>
<P>
	He argued that his punishment was not authorized by the league's  
union agreement, and accused NBA investigators of destroying 
interview notes and doctoring evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also claimed racial discrimination on several grounds:  
that whites like Chambers were treated more leniently, that the 
Warriors insisted on broader rights to terminate Sprewell's 
contract than they demanded in white players' contracts, and that 
most of the team's and league's upper management is white. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker said the arbitrator reasonably concluded that Sprewell's  
punishment was authorized by the union contract, and had considered 
and rejected his complaints about the evidence, decisions the judge 
would not second-guess. 
</P>
<P>
	Feerick also examined the Chambers incident and others cited by  
Sprewell and found that differing punishments were based on the 
seriousness of the offense, not the race of the player, the judge 
said. 
</P>

	Sprewell's factual claims, even if proven, would not show that  
the Warriors or the league were motivated by racism, Walker said. 
And even if racial bias were shown, the judge said, Sprewell failed 
to demonstrate ``a public policy that specifically militates 
against suspension of an employee who violently attacks his 
employer.''

<HEADLINE> NCAA Ratings Set All-Time Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Even a thrilling national championship game  
could not prevent TV ratings from falling to an all-time low for 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut's upset of Duke on Monday night posted a 17.2  
national rating and a 27 share, the lowest since CBS began 
televising the event in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 tournament as a whole had a 6.8/15 share, down 7  
percent from last year's 7.3/17. The previous mark of futility was 
a 7.2 in 1997, the year Arizona defeated Kentucky in the title 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's championship game was down 3 percent from last  
season's Kentucky-Utah final, which had a 17.8 rating and 28 share. 
It was the lowest-rated NCAA championship game since the 1972 
UCLA-Florida State final, which was played in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The games weren't as close as they had been last year,'' said  
CBS spokeswoman Leslie Ann Wade. ``You're always a little 
disappointed even when it's a high number because you'd like to see 
it higher. This is one of our favorite events and this doesn't do 
anything to alter our affection for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only 14 of the 63 games were decided by five points or under,  
just one went into overtime and 17 were blowouts of 20 points or 
more. Last year's tournament had 20 games within five points, five 
in overtime and 11 determined by 20 points or more. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have close games through the whole tournament, people  
start to catch on, make an investment and end up with us on Monday 
night,'' added Wade. ``I think that hurt us a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings for most of the West Coast cities fell because there  
were no representatives from the region, unlike last year when both 
Stanford and Utah made the Final Four. The championship game 
dropped 28 percent in Los Angeles and 13 percent in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	For the women's championship game between Purdue and Duke, ESPN  
set a record with the biggest rating in the network's four-year 
history of broadcasting the event. 
</P>
<P>
	It broke the 4.0 mark set in 1997 between Tennessee and Old  
Dominion. 
</P>
<P>
	The game posted a 4.3 cable rating in ESPN's universe of 75.8  
million homes, an increase of 16 percent from last year's 
Tennessee-Louisiana Tech title game that had a 3.7. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall tournament ratings were also up this year for the women.  
Games on ESPN rose 24 percent and ESPN2 had a 8 percent increase, 
compared with last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women's basketball is expanding in depth and gaining viewers  
on a seasonal basis,'' said Len DeLuca, ESPN vice president of 
programming development. ``Are we surprised even without Tennessee 
and UConn that we continue to grow? No, because we are college 
basketball's best platform for promotion and growth, whether it be 
women's or men's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the nation  
tuned to a program, and each network point represents 994,000 
homes. The share is the percentage tuned to a program among those 
televisions on at the time.

<HEADLINE> D-Backs Get Frascatore for Sodowsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks, looking to for  
experienced middle-relief help, acquired right-hander John 
Frascatore from the St. Louis Cardinals for right-hander Clint 
Sodowsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Frascatore, 29, was 3-4 last season in 69 appearances with a  
4.14 ERA after going 5-2 with a 2.48 ERA for the Cardinals in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a lot of moxie about him and competes like a son of a  
gun,'' Arizona manager Buck Showalter said. ``We think he'll fit 
right in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trade was the first of two the Diamondbacks made Tuesday to  
acquire relief pitchers. Late in the day, they acquired 
right-hander Darren Holmes and about $1 million from the New York 
Yankees for young pitcher Ben Ford and minor league catcher Izzy 
Molina. 
</P>
<P>
	Frascatore, 29, became expendable to the Cardinals because of  
the offseason acquisitions of relievers Scott Radinsky and Ricky 
Bottalico. 
</P>
<P>
	Sodowsky, 26, also a right-hander, was 3-6 in 45 games for the  
Diamondbacks last season with a 5.68 ERA. He appeared in five games 
for Arizona this spring before being optioned to Triple-A Tucson. 
He had allowed six runs in eight innings in his only Triple-A 
spring appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals said Sodowsky will be assigned to their Triple-A  
team in Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be a good opportunity for me,'' Sodowsky  
said. ``It's been a struggle for me the last week and a half but 
I'm trying to stay positive. I'm looking forward to trying to get 
back to the big leagues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sodowsky was taken by the Tigers in the ninth round of the 1991  
amateur draft. Cardinals general manager Walt Jocketty said he 
likes Sodowsky's potential. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a live arm and has been clocked in the mid-90s,''  
Jocketty said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 103 career games with Detroit (1995-96), Pittsburgh (1997)  
and Arizona (1998), Sodowsky is 8-13 with a 5.84 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Diamondbacks general manager Joe Garagiola Jr. said that with  
Frascatore and Greg Swindell, the team has two reliable, 
experienced middle-inning relievers. 
</P>
<P>
	``With he and Greg, we've got two guys who can do two things  
that relief pitchers need to do -- take the ball and throw it over 
the plate,'' Garagiola said. ``They had 120-some appearances 
between the two of them last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frascatore appeared in five exhibition games with St. Louis this  
spring, going 1-0 with a 5.63 ERA and allowing five runs in eight 
innings. He has a 9-8 career record with a 3.74 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``His ERA is up a little but he's the same pitcher he was last  
year,'' Garagiola said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garagiola said the Diamondbacks still might make another move in  
the next day to further bolster their relief staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade gives Arizona a likely opening-day relief staff of  
Swindell, Frascatore, Holmes, closer Gregg Olson, Brian Anderson 
and Amaury Telemaco, if he recovers from tendinitis in his 
shoulder.

<HEADLINE> CPSC To Alert Consumers of Recalls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Consumer Product Safety Commission is  
launching a campaign to raise awareness about product recalls, 
contending that despite the government's recall warnings consumers 
continue to use hazardous products and put themselves at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission was announcing its recall roundup today to  
highlight some of the millions of recalled products consumers may 
still be using, from playpens with protruding rivets to an 
under-the-counter toaster that can start fires. 
</P>
<P>
	As the agency responsible for protecting the public, the CPSC  
announces about 300 recalls each year as it works with companies to 
ensure that new products with the same safety dangers do not end up 
on store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	But getting consumers to dispose of faulty products is another  
story. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can get dangerous products off store shelves, but the real  
challenge is to get them out of families' homes,'' says Ann Brown, 
the chairwoman. The commission sometimes learns of deaths or 
injuries caused by products after they have been recalled, she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands, sometimes even millions, of units of a product can be  
recalled at once, making it difficult to reach everyone who bought 
them and is at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the commission has recalled nearly 10 million sets  
of play yards or playpens, by various manufacturers, because of 
protruding rivets that can pose a strangulation hazard, such as to 
children wearing loose clothing who could become entangled. The 
products have caused eight deaths, according to the CPSC. 
</P>
<P>
	They are made by Bilt-Rite, Evenflo, Gerry, Graco, Kolcraft,  
Playskool, Pride-Trimble and Strolee. Consumers can get a free 
repair kit by calling 1-800-794-4115. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 million battery-powered Power Wheels vehicles by  
Fisher-Price, made before October 1998, have been recalled because 
the electrical components can overheat and cause fires. The agency 
has received 700 such reports, and 150 reports of fires with nine 
children suffering minor burns. Consumers should remove the 
batteries and call Fisher-Price at 1-800-977-7800 for a free 
repair. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spacemaker Optima toaster by Black &AMP; Decker can set food on  
fire and, when the door opens automatically, also expose cabinets 
to flames. The agency knows of more than 1,000 fires and eight 
burns. The company offers a free replacement by calling 
1-800-746-2159. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can learn about recalled products from the CPSC's  
hotline at 1-800-638-2772 or by visiting the Web site at 
http://www.cpsc.gov. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials and grassroots groups plan to publicize the  
recall campaign and, in some states, recalled products will be 
rounded up and brought to central locations for disposal.

<HEADLINE> Alusuisse and Viag Merger Is Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- A planned merger between  
Alusuisse-Lonza Ltd. (Algroup), Switzerland's biggest aluminum 
group, and Germany's Viag industrial concern is dead, the Swiss 
company's chief executive said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger, announced in November, fell apart over a share swap  
arrangement which was considered unacceptable by Algroup's major 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deal is dead. We spent a huge amount of time and effort  
and everyone is tired,'' said Algroup chief executive Sergio 
Marchionne. ``The last thing I want to do is talk with Viag again 
about reskinning a cat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The companies would share the 20 million franc ($13.5 million)  
cost of the aborted negotiations, said Marchionne. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Ebner, who owns a 22 percent stake in Algroup, said he  
and other shareholders were not prepared to accept Viag's offer 
which would have given Algroup 32.5 percent of the deal rather than 
the 35 percent originally agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't in the interest of the Algroup shareholders,'' Ebner  
told Swiss radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors that the deal was on the rocks began Sunday when Algroup  
president Theodor M. Tschopp announced his resignation, saying he 
no longer wanted to be involved in the merger talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger would have created a company worth $29 billion. About  
2,500 jobs would have been lost, 2 percent of the combined 
workforce of 127,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Alusuisse dates back to 1888 when it opened Europe's first  
aluminum smelter. The company nearly went broke in the 1980s after 
a series of disastrous forays into the United States, but was 
rescued by Swiss banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Viag was set up as a state concern in 1923. It was privatized in  
1986. It is involved in energy, chemicals, packaging and 
telecommunications.

<HEADLINE> Electric Deregulation Report Issued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government study concludes electricity  
deregulation would lead to rate cuts for consumers in 26 states, 
but increase them in 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department report issued Monday does not predict  
how much rates would go up, but says rural America would need a 
``safety net'' ranging from $1 billion in 2000 to $2.4 billion in 
2015 to offset them. 
</P>
<P>
	The report predicts deregulation would lead to lower rates for  
consumers mainly in the Southwest, Northeast and southern Plains, 
but raise them in the Pacific Northwest, Mountain states, Mid-South 
and in the northern Plains, as well as in some Great Lakes states. 
The report focused on the 45 states with rural electric 
cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen states have already moved toward opening their  
electricity markets, but efforts in Congress to enact deregulation 
legislation have bogged down in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration announced a deregulation plan last  
year that it said would save consumers $20 billion a year. It would 
call for open competition nationwide among electricity suppliers by 
2003 but would also let states ``opt out'' of the program if they 
believed competition would not help them. 
</P>
<P>
	While the report does not dispute the administration's view that  
it would save consumers $20 billion in all, it found the savings 
will be concentrated in some states. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., sent copies of the report to all  
Oregon legislators and urged them to resist a push for electricity 
deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
	An Agriculture Department spokesman, Andrew Kauders, said the  
report was leaked before it was finished and that people should not 
draw conclusions from it.

<HEADLINE> Texas Man Charged With Killing Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABILENE, Texas (AP) -- A 19-year-old man was charged Tuesday with  
killing his girlfriend and three of her friends -- possibly because 
she refused to help him conceal a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were hunting for Arthur Goodman and his 16-year-old  
brother, who may have been with him when the shootings occurred 
Monday afternoon. An apartment handyman who might have been trying 
to help the women was shot in the abdomen and critically wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman's girlfriend, Sandy Witt, 20, lived in a duplex in a  
high-crime area of this west Texas city, which is home to three 
Christian universities and an Air Force base. The city had six 
homicides in all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Detective Jay Hatcher said family and friends gave police two  
versions of a possible motive. In one, Ms. Witt wouldn't supply an 
alibi to police for an undisclosed crime in which Goodman is a 
suspect. In the other, Ms. Witt was planning to give police 
incriminating information about Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Witt's friends -- Naomi Martinez, 23; Erica Arispe, 21; and  
Penny Estrada, 21 -- ``just happened to be in the wrong place at the 
wrong time,'' Hatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently Goodman wedged himself between the women and the  
door and, as they tried to escape, he shot them one after 
another,'' Hatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police believe handyman Larry Hammond was shot in the stomach as  
he ran to help the women. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers also suspect Goodman in the Sunday night shooting of a  
16-year-old boy who survived. Police wouldn't say if that was the 
crime to which a possible motive might be linked. Hatcher said the 
motive in that shooting was revenge for an attack on Goodman's 
16-year-old brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Estrada's mother, Juanita Valdez, joined dozens of people  
who visited Ms. Witt's duplex Tuesday to pray, leave flowers or 
poetry and light candles in memory of the four slain women. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were like sisters they were so close,'' she said. ``They  
all loved each other so much, I can't believe this happened.''

<HEADLINE> BMW Sees 1999 Results Matching '98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Luxury automaker BMW expects to at least  
match last year's profit and sales figures this year despite 
troubles in its Rover unit. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW also pressed Britain to conclude a deal on government aid to  
overhaul Rover's outdated Longbridge plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to come to an agreement in the next four weeks,''  
BMW's new chairman Joachim Milberg said Tuesday at a news 
conference in Munich to review its 1998 earnings figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry sources have said BMW is seeking more aid than Britain  
is willing to givem but Milberg declined to give any details. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW's profit fell 28 percent in 1998 to 903 million marks, or  
$531 milliond, because of losses in the British unit that was hurt 
by the strong pound and declining sales at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for 1998 were 63.13 billion marks, or $36.9 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Rover's loss last year widened to 1.87 billion marks, or $1  
billion, from 260 million marks in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW has invested 6.5 billion marks, or $3.57 billion, in Rover  
since buying the carmaker in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger-than-expected performance at BMW Automobiles and  
Aeroengines helped limit the impact of Rover's losses on overall 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Milberg said he was optimistic that 1999 would at least be as  
strong as last year, although deliveries to customers in the first 
quarter dropped 5.1 percent compared to 1998, to 280,000 units.

<HEADLINE> Settlement Sought in Microsoft Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As secret negotiations begin in an effort to  
settle the Microsoft antitrust case, the government must decide 
whether it will require the company to surrender the lucrative 
blueprints for its Windows software as a condition of ending the 
bitter courtroom fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, which has said it won't reveal details of the  
settlement talks expected to begin today in Washington, bristled 
over indications that government lawyers might put forth such a 
proposal, which they have discussed openly over past weeks along 
with other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	The government contends that allowing other companies to sell  
and modify Windows would successfully dilute Microsoft's influence 
as the monopoly supplier of the software that runs most of the 
world's personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company said legal protections for its own products  
would prevent any mandatory licensing to other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are laws in this country that protect the copyright of  
all companies that create intellectual property,'' spokesman Greg 
Shaw said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also rejected as unacceptable any proposal to break up  
the company, an idea supported by some of its toughest critics in 
the high-tech industry. The government is said not to be actively 
proposing a breakup. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's certainly no breakup of the company into smaller  
companies that I would find very acceptable, and we're certainly 
not thinking about that as a possibility,'' Microsoft President 
Steve Ballmer said Monday in a conference call with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft was expected to meet here today with lawyers from the  
Justice Department and 19 states suing it over alleged antitrust 
violations. Both sides are under orders from a judge to negotiate, 
although experts agree that any settlement is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, in a lengthy recess, is tentatively scheduled to  
resume April 12 but may not continue until mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think the most likely result here is that we'll be back  
at trial,'' Wisconsin Attorney General James Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates declined to speculate about  
chances for success. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that kind of speculation is not valuable,'' he said  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	State attorneys general and their staff lawyers have said  
previously they might consider requiring Microsoft to sell to other 
companies or give away its valuable source code for Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	But these government officials, who met by conference call  
Monday afternoon, wouldn't commit afterward to exactly what they 
may demand in settlement talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had some discussions but have not settled on what our  
settlement position would be,'' Doyle said. ``There are a lot of 
very technical suggestions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Kovacic, a George Washington University antitrust  
expert, predicted Microsoft would find any proposal to surrender 
its Windows blueprint ``out of the question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also characterized the proposal as a nuclear-weapon-style  
demand by the government, akin to calls for breaking up the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a breakup is a megaton weapon, then forced licensing is a  
high-kiloton yield -- it's just a smaller nuclear package,'' Kovacic 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said last week it won't accept restrictions on what  
new features it can add to Windows. But it indicated it would 
consider changing some of its most controversial agreements with 
computer makers and Internet providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also asked U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson  
on Monday to make America Online, Netscape Communications and Sun 
Microsystems turn over more e-mails about AOL's recent $9.9 billion 
purchase of Netscape and a related deal with Sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson on Friday told Microsoft it can question Steve Case,  
AOL's chairman, and three other executives about their plans and 
the possible impact on the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, Netscape and Sun are rivals of Microsoft, which contends  
that the alliance of the three companies illustrates healthy 
competition in the high-tech industry.

<HEADLINE> US Seeks WTO Concessions From China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- The United States' top trade negotiator sought  
more market-opening concessions from Chinese leaders today as both 
sides worked to wrap up 13 years of fitful talks on China's entry 
to the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and Chinese negotiators are hoping to conclude a deal in  
time for Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to Washington next week for the 
highest-level talks since President Clinton came to Beijing last 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are getting closer,'' U.S. Commerce Secretary William  
Daley, on a separate trade mission to China, said today. He added 
that Zhu's visit provided ``a window open'' to getting a WTO deal. 
</P>
<P>
	China has been seeking membership to the Geneva-based body that  
sets trade rules and its predecessor since 1986. The United States 
has insisted, however, that Beijing commit to steps to further open 
its market commensurate with China's growing economic clout. 
</P>
<P>
	China has improved its offers in recent weeks, hoping to get  
into the WTO before new negotiations on global trade rules open 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky was to see Zhu  
later today before ending a 24-hour stopover in Beijing to spur 
negotiations on. She refused to comment to reporters before meeting 
with Cabinet member Wu Yi, a former trade minister who has guided 
China's WTO negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	On the meeting's eve, Barshefsky spokesman J. Ziegler said the  
U.S. team needed new offers from the Chinese side if both sides 
were going to surmount ``substantial roadblocks'' before Zhu's 
visit. The United States has insisted on broad access to sell 
agricultural and industrial goods and financial services. 
</P>
<P>
	``China has made great efforts in opening up its market,''  
Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi told reporters. Although he 
declined to say whether any new offers were on the table, he hoped 
a deal could be struck soon. 
</P>
<P>
	While Barshefsky held closed-door talks, Daley sought to apply  
pressure publicly. In a speech to American business executives, he 
warned that by keeping markets closed China risked turning its 
trade surplus with the United States -- now running at $1 billion a 
week -- into a political issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Complaints will soon come ``from every quarter of Congress and  
the American people because our patience is wearing very thin,'' 
Daley said.

<HEADLINE> Terry Nichols Faces State Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Oklahoma City bombing conspirator Terry  
Nichols, already serving a life prison term in federal prison, has 
been charged with 160 counts of murder by state prosecutors who 
have vowed to seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not satisfied with the outcome of the Nichols trial,''  
District Attorney Bob Macy said Monday after filing a 56-page 
document outlining the charges. ``I feel like he needs to be tried 
before an Oklahoma jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols, 43, is in prison for conspiracy and the deaths of eight  
law enforcement officers in the April 19, 1995, bombing of the 
Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Hundreds were injured and 168 
people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Macy also accused Nichols of one count of first-degree  
manslaughter for the death of an unborn child whose mother died in 
the bombing, one count of conspiracy to commit murder and one count 
of aiding and counseling in the placing of a substance or bomb near 
a public building. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will take a year to get to trial. It's a very complex  
trial,'' Macy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Macy predicted a series of legal challenges to trying Nichols in  
Oklahoma, including a request for a change of venue from Oklahoma 
County. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor said it is unclear when Nichols will be brought  
to Oklahoma from a federal prison near Florence, Colo. Nichols was 
convicted in federal court in Denver on Dec. 23, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Macy has promised a state trial for convicted bomber Timothy  
McVeigh, but he has said he would try Nichols first and wait to see 
how McVeigh fares in the appeal of his federal death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Tigar, Nichols' lead attorney in the federal trial, told  
KCNC-TV of Denver that Macy's action raises serious questions of 
double jeopardy because of the close cooperation of state and 
federal agencies after the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Terry Nichols was acquitted by a jury in Denver, Colo.,  
selected from a fair cross section of the community, acquitted of 
first-degree murder, of second-degree murder, arson, use of a 
weapon of mass destruction,'' he said. ``Under those circumstances 
there is no basis for the Oklahoma authorities to relitigate that 
issue which has already been decided in his favor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols was at his home in Herington, Kan., the day the bomb  
exploded. Federal prosecutors accused him of helping McVeigh 
deliver a getaway car to Oklahoma City three days before the 
bombing and of working with McVeigh to pack the bomb inside a Ryder 
truck on the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	They also introduced evidence that Nichols used an alias to buy  
two tons of explosive fertilizer and helped McVeigh steal 
explosives from a rock quarry. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also contended in the federal trial that Nichols  
robbed Arkansas gun collector Roger Moore to raise money to live on 
while the men prepared for the bombing.

<HEADLINE> EU Panel OKs AT&AMP;T-Brit Telecom Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union regulators have granted  
antitrust clearance for the $11 billion alliance between AT&AMP;T and 
British Telecommunications PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision announced Tuesday by the EU Commission follows an  
agreement by AT&AMP;T to sell ACC Corp., a British provider of long 
distance telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed venture is still awaiting the nod if the U.S.  
Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU Commission said it was not worried about the venture  
becoming a monopoly, ``This is a dynamic market and there are a 
number of competitors as well as a substantial number of potential 
competitors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission estimated the joint venture's combined share of  
the international carrier services market at 18 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined, AT&AMP;T and BT carry about half the calling traffic  
between the United States and Britain, but own less than 20 percent 
of the network capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission said that increased capacity on the route is  
pushing prices down and this is making the route easier for new 
competitors to enter. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the British market, the Commission said it found ``no  
evidence of the creation or strengthening of a dominant position'' 
due to the creation of the joint venture.

<HEADLINE> Roque To Start for Brewers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Scott Karl's rocky spring has cost him the  
opening day start for the pitching-weak Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Phil Garner made the surprise announcement Tuesday that  
rookie left-hander Rafael Roque will start at St. Louis on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Roque spent four seasons in Class-A ball with the New York Mets  
before accelerating through the Brewers' farm system last year and 
getting nine late-season major league starts. He wasn't even 
expected to make the roster, much less the rotation, when camp 
began last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I was real surprised,'' Roque said in Spanish after  
Garner informed him. ``When I came to camp, they told me I'd be the 
fifth starter if I did a good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even that was wishful thinking until Cal Eldred, recovering  
from elbow surgery, was placed on the 15-day disabled list, opening 
up a spot in the rotation for Roque, a 25-year-old left-hander from 
the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not nervous,'' Roque said. ``It's just another game, but  
I'm really excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garner selected Karl as his opening day starter earlier this  
month but had second thoughts when his ``ace'' left-hander went 0-2 
with a 7.20 ERA in four spring starts, allowing 12 runs, 23 hits, 
10 walks and four homers in 15 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't justified to give him the first start despite having  
the seniority of the guys,'' general manager Sal Bando said. 
</P>
<P>
	Is there a message being delivered to Karl or the rest of the  
staff? 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't do the job, you're not going to pitch or you're  
not going to pitch where you thought you were,'' Bando said. ``And 
what they also have hanging over their heads is Cal Eldred is going 
to join this club sometime in April, assuming everything goes fine 
there. And the guy struggling the most is the guy that's going to 
go to the bullpen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Garner decided to demote Karl from the largely ceremonial  
role of opening day starter, he didn't want to put the burden on 
promising youngster Steve Woodard, who has the best stuff on the 
staff, or on Jim Abbott, who's continuing his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Pulsipher (0-5) wasn't an option. So, that left Roque, who  
made the most of his first major league camp, going 2-1 with a 1.83 
ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's safe to say we don't have a No. 1 pitcher,'' Bando said.  
``Actually, Woody has pitched the best, but we didn't want to put 
Woody in a position where he felt like he was shouldering this 
responsibility as being the No. 1 guy. So, we wanted to leave him 
No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we put Roque there, he just seems to have a  
demeanor where nothing seems to bother him,'' Bando added. ``And 
we've told him, `Look, this doesn't mean you're the No. 1 pitcher. 
It just means you're pitching the first game.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Garner said Karl ``handled it very professionally.'' While  
congenial in the clubhouse, Karl declined to discuss the change. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl bounced back from a tough spring last year by winning his  
first four decisions in April after posting a 9.00 ERA in spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers were hoping for help from St. Louis, but Bando said  
the proposed Fernando Vina-for-Jose Jimenez trade appears dead 
because the Cardinals are reluctant to deal a pitching prospect, 
even for an All-Star second baseman.

<HEADLINE> Andy Pettitte May Start Year on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- New York Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte is  
expected to start the regular season on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems pretty inevitable since I'm not pitching the first  
week,'' Pettitte said. ``I just have to try and get ready. I'm 
trying to stay away from having any setbacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander left his spring debut on March 7 after one  
inning with a strained muscle in his throwing elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Although final roster decisions are not expected until this  
weekend, team officials admit there is a good possibility Pettitte 
will be placed on the DL. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte pitched two innings in a minor league game Sunday and  
will throw again against minor leaguers Thursday or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to pitch in games ... it's totally different,''  
Pettitte said. ``It's a matter of getting my pitch count up. I feel 
good and I feel healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte threw 48 pitches during a 14-minute bullpen session on  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	If placed on the disabled list, Pettitte's stay could be  
backdated 10 day from opening day, meaning he could be activated as 
soon as April 10.

<HEADLINE> Survey Rates Best, Worst Umpires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tim McClelland and Jerry Crawford are baseball's  
top umpires, and Ken Kaiser and Charlie Williams are the worst, 
according to a survey by the players' association. 
</P>
<P>
	Players rated umpires on physical condition, physical and mental  
toughness, accuracy of calls on the bases, accuracy of calls at the 
plate, consistency, temperament, respect for players and overall 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	McClelland topped the AL ratings, followed by Jim Joyce, Richie  
Garcia, John Hirschbeck, Mike Reilly and Drew Coble. Kaiser was 
32nd and last, with Durwood Merrill 31st, Ted Hendry 30th, Joe 
Brinkman 29th, Dale Ford 28th and Drew Coble 27th. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford, president of the umpires' union, was tops in the NL,  
followed by Ed Rapuano, Ed Montague, Randy March, Frank Pulli and 
Jeff Kellogg. Charlie Williams was 36th and last, with Eric Gregg 
35th, Joe West 34th, Bruce Froemming 33rd and Harry Wendelstedt 
32nd. 
</P>
<P>
	West and Froemming are among the most confrontational umpires.  
West was last in the NL in both the respect for players and 
temperament categories and Froemming was next to last in both. 
</P>
<P>
	``I give no credence whatsoever to those ratings,'' umpires'  
union head Richie Phillips said. ``I think they're patently absurd. 
I've even been told that some players had their kids fill them 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball officials said they thought players penalized  
confrontational umpires in their ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	``The survey was a players' association initiative, and the  
players are certainly entitled to their opinion,'' NL president Len 
Coleman said. ``I will point out that umpire popularity was a 
factor, and the skills and qualities of many fine umpires were 
distorted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig and AL president Gene Budig declined  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look at a guy like Bruce Froemming and how many times he's  
assigned by the league president to work big, important games, and 
then you see him rated next to last, what does that mean?'' 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ratings, which were distributed to players, were first  
reported earlier this week by the New York Post, USA Today and the 
Philadelphia Daily News. A copy was obtained by The Associated 
Press on Tuesday from a baseball source on the condition he not be 
identified.

<HEADLINE> UConn Puts Their Brand on NCAA Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- They stopped the player who  
supposedly couldn't be stopped. They rattled the team that 
supposedly couldn't be rattled. They beat the team that supposedly 
couldn't be beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-three teams presumably were playing for second place in  
the NCAA tournament nicknamed the Duke Invitational. Every team, 
that is, but Connecticut, which would accept nothing but first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	So much for Duke's championship beach party in the first  
tropical Final Four ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``They knew they were going to win,'' Connecticut coach Jim  
Calhoun said after his Huskies upset Duke 77-74 Monday to win the 
first national title in school history. ``They were going to beat 
the best -- and they did beat the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Blue Devils, it truly was a Blue Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I still don't understand the things that we did and  
what we accomplished,'' said Richard Hamilton, who led UConn with 
27 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest surprise of the NCAA final turned out to be Elton  
Brand vs. Jake Voskuhl. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, the player of the year, was assumed to have too much  
skill, too much strength, too much game for the 6-foot-11 Voskuhl, 
a respectable shot-blocker and rebounder but an infrequent scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun knew that Voskuhl, who has piled up plenty of frequent  
fouler mileage in this tournament, couldn't handle Brand by himself 
-- and, if he tried to, he might foul out by halftime. So he didn't 
ask him to. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, 6-7 Kevin Freeman doubled down on Brand whenever Duke  
tried to work the ball inside. Calhoun also substituted frequently 
and effectively as nine different Huskies played as many as seven 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Souleymane Wane did spot duty for Voskuhl, and Edmund Saunders  
supplied valuable minutes -- and valuable muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great team defense,'' Voskuhl said. ``We got help from  
everyone and everywhere. We had a great game plan, and that's why 
we won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand had 15 points, but was limited to eight shots and finished  
with only as many rebounds (13) as he had in the first half 
Saturday against Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to attack Brand as much as we could, and we were  
willing to use 11, 12 people to do that,'' Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, Brand felt like he was being defended by half the  
state of Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	``They made it really tough to get open looks,'' Brand said.  
``They were fighting ... every time I touched it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They broke our defense down,'' the Blue Devils' Chris  
Carrawell said. ``No one has done that all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's because it took Calhoun nearly all year to formulate  
the game plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in November, when UConn (34-2) and not Duke (37-2) was  
ranked No. 1, Calhoun and his staff began scouting prospective NCAA 
tournament opponents. At the top of the list was Duke, which didn't 
appear on the Huskies' schedule, but did show up regularly on their 
TV screens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must have watched them 8-9 times,'' Hamilton said. ``They  
were always on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun accumulated the data on blue index cards, which he  
carried with him Monday in the very arena where Duke's season ended 
last year with a South Regional final loss to Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to put pressure on them,'' Calhoun said.  
</P>
<P>
	At the end, it was Duke that caved into the kind of late-game  
pressure it had felt so infrequently this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Duke's been in a tight game like that in a long  
time,'' Freeman said. ``We were confident, and we said we were 
going to win it with our defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They did, as defensive whiz Ricky Moore pressured Trajan Langdon  
into turning the ball over on Duke's final possession. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the celebration that Khalid El-Amin nearly missed. As  
he returned to the court wearing one of UConn's championship 
T-shirts, a security guard mistook the Double XL-sized point guard 
for a fan and wouldn't let him on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't believe I was a player,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	It was if the security guard was confirming what much of America  
thought beforehand -- the Huskies didn't have the look of a national 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Duke's a great team ... they won 37 games,'' Calhoun  
said. ``But we're 34-2. We're not shocked. We're happy, we're 
proud, but I don't think we're shocked.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The interest rate on 52-week Treasury bills  
fell in Tuesday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The discount rate was 4.495 percent, down from 4.665 percent at  
the last auction on March 2. It was the lowest rate since 52-week 
bills sold for 4.370 percent on Feb. 2. The bills will carry an 
equivalent coupon interest rate of 4.732 percent with each $10,000 
in face value selling for $9,545.50.

<P>
	Sales totaled $10 billion out of bids of $26.7 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Treasury Department sold 19-day cash management  
bills at a discount rate of 4.83 percent. The discount rate 
understates the actual return to investors -- 4.92 percent with a

<HEADLINE> N.H. House Rejects Income Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- State lawmakers have rejected a proposed  
income tax, all but preserving New Hampshire's status as one of two 
states with neither a general sales tax nor an income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3.5 percent income tax was proposed as a way of meeting the  
state Supreme Court's Thursday deadline for a new, fairer system to 
pay for schools. The state now relies on widely varying local 
property taxes, which the court ruled unconstitutional in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican-controlled House voted 211-168 against the tax  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, had promised to veto an income  
tax. She has proposed a solution based on a statewide property tax, 
revised and expanded business taxes, a capital gains tax and video 
gambling at the state's four race tracks. The Senate is expected to 
vote on a version of her plan Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Towns will have no authority to collect property taxes for  
schools after Thursday, although tax bills are not scheduled to be 
issued until June. Two large banks have said they will continue to 
lend money to school districts while a solution is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	Unsure of how much money they will have next school year, some  
school districts already have notified teachers their contracts 
won't be renewed. Many more districts are expected to issue pink 
slips if no solution is found by April 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine states have no income taxes: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New  
Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming. 
New Hampshire and Alaska also have no general sales tax.

<HEADLINE> Texas Teen Found in Tiny Room </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Police rescued a mentally retarded  
18-year-old woman with cerebral palsy who had been confined to a 
crib all her life, fed from a baby bottle and weighed only 54 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-ager's parents, who could not be reached for comment  
Monday, face possible state felony charges of injury to an invalid. 
The teen was placed in protective custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found the woman March 1 in a tiny room after an anonymous  
caller reported seeing a nude woman climbing from a window, the El 
Paso Times reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, whose weight would be normal for a 7-year-old child,  
had tried to climb out of the window but was pulled back into the 
apartment, police Sgt. John Haddad told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Haddad told the newspaper he did not believe she was trying to  
escape and said she was not being held captive. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records show the woman was described as indigent and  
living with her mother and father, and a brother and sister, both 
minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the League of United Latin American Citizens, a  
Hispanic civil rights group which was granted temporary 
guardianship of the teen, told the court that she ``has been 
confined to her bed for the past 18 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators described her room as 10 feet long and 2 1/2 feet  
wide -- barely wide enough to hold the crib. The room wasn't heated 
or air-conditioned, police testified at a March 5 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The apartment, Haddad said, was dirty and had no furniture other  
than the wooden crib where she slept on its metal coils in 
``deplorable'' conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the woman cannot walk or talk because of her condition.

<HEADLINE> Parents of Heist Figures Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The parents of the one of the main  
figures in the $17 million Loomis Fargo &AMP; Co. heist have been 
sentenced to house arrest for helping hide some of the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary and Robert Chambers, the parents of Steve Chambers, were  
sentenced Monday to five months of house arrest for helping their 
son and daughter-in-law hide about $466,000 in stolen money in 
safe-deposit boxes. Electronic ankle bracelets will monitor their 
movements. 
</P>
<P>
	After house arrest, they will serve two years and seven months  
of probation, followed by two years of supervised release. They 
were also ordered to pay $2,200 in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just thankful they didn't have to go to prison,'' said  
David Phillips, their lawyer, outside the federal courthouse in 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chambers received $500 in cash and a $1,200 computer from  
their son to rent safe deposit boxes, said Assistant U.S. Attorney 
David Keesler. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Chambers pleaded guilty to various charges connected to  
the October 1997 heist and is awaiting sentencing.

<HEADLINE> Baffert: 2nd a Charm at Santa Anita </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In each of the last two years, Bob Baffert-trained colts have  
gone from second in the Santa Anita Derby to the winner's circle at 
the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	So as he prepares Triple Crown contenders Prime Timber and  
General Challenge for Saturday's Santa Anita renewal, Baffert sees 
no reason for a change. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess whoever runs second will win the Kentucky Derby,''  
said Baffert, who won at Churchill Downs with Silver Charm in 1997 
and with Real Quiet last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking in a conference call Tuesday from California, Baffert  
said he expects a crowded schedule of Derby prep races the next two 
weekends -- including the Santa Anita and Flamingo Stakes this 
weekend and the Blue Grass Stakes and Wood Memorial on April 10 -- 
to sort out a large field of Triple Crown contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert arrived at Santa Anita in Arcadia, Calif., after a  
whirlwind trip that began in United Arab Emirates, where the 
trainer prepped Silver Charm for Sunday's Dubai World Cup. The day 
before that race, Baffert flew to Kentucky to watch another of his 
Triple Crown contenders, Straight Man, in the Gallery Furniture.com 
Stakes at Turfway. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend turned out badly, as Straight Man faded in the  
stretch at Turfway, finishing fourth to Nick Zito's Stephen Got 
Even. In Dubai, Silver Charm was sixth in an eight-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert, who watched a broadcast of the Dubai race, said Silver  
Charm was weakened by racing without Lasix. The anti-bleeding 
medication is banned in Dubai. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could tell at the three-eighths pole he didn't have any  
horse in him,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the 5-year-old's future, Baffert said Silver Charm  
will be evaluated when he returns to United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going to leave the door open,'' he said. ``This  
isn't the end of the world for him. ... I'm not down on Silver 
Charm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert arrived in California in time to watch General Challenge  
and Prime Timber work out on Monday. Prime Timber is coming off a 
March 13 win at Santa Anita in the San Felipe Stakes, when he ran 
with blinkers for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``That race really woke him up,'' Baffert said. ``He's learning  
how to run, figuring out his style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge finished a poor fifth in the March 14  
Louisiana Derby, prompting Baffert to compare him a certain 
flamboyant basketball player known for disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a lot like Dennis Rodman, he's a big flashy dude,''  
Baffert said. ``He just didn't show up that day, but when he does 
show up, he's real strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert said he pulled a third potential Santa Anita starter,  
Finders Gold, after a poor workout Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	As for his two strong 3-year-old fillies, Excellent Meeting and  
Silverbulletday, Baffert said both are being pointed at the 
Kentucky Oaks, the day before the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	He left the door open for running one in the Kentucky Derby,  
though, saying, ``You don't know until you get down there. Maybe 
we'll enter both races.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I would say if I was going to run one of them in  
there (the Derby) it would be Excellent Meeting,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards $81M in Tobacco Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- In the biggest liability verdict ever  
against the tobacco industry, a jury ordered Philip Morris to pay 
$81 million Tuesday to the family of a man who died of lung cancer 
after smoking Marlboros for four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory by the wife and children of Jesse Williams was the  
second major hit against Philip Morris this year. A San Francisco 
jury awarded $51.5 million last month to a Marlboro smoker who has 
inoperable lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury awarded $1.6 million in compensatory damages and $79.5  
million in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Although no smoking liability verdict against the tobacco  
industry has survived on appeal, Wall Street analysts had been 
watching the Portland case closely to see if huge damage awards 
against Big Tobacco were now a trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will make the stocks go down,'' said Gary Black, an  
industry analyst with the New York brokerage firm Sanford C. 
Bernstein &AMP; Co. ``This will persuade the industry to start thinking 
the tide may be turning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Williams family, who sought $101 million, alleged the  
company knew its cigarettes could cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony portrayed Williams, a former janitor with the Portland  
school system, as a three-pack-day Marlboro smoker who believed the 
manufacturer wouldn't sell a harmful product and who was heavily 
addicted to nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams died in 1997 just five months after he was diagnosed  
with small-cell carcinoma of the lungs. He was 67 and left behind a 
wife, Mayola, and six adult children. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members hugged their lawyers after the verdict was read,  
but had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris attorney Walter Cofer said he will appeal. He  
noted the tobacco industry has a 40-year history of prevailing in 
such cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at this verdict, it was not supported by the  
evidence,'' Cofer said. ``It was a product of passion and 
prejudice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-member Circuit Court jury, which included three smokers  
and four former smokers, spent a little more than two days 
reviewing a month of technical and often conflicting testimony from 
experts in such areas as cancer diagnosis, radiology and the 
chemistry of tobacco smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the medical testimony on both sides was aimed at showing  
that Williams' cancer arose either before or after 1988. If the 
jury concluded that Williams' cancer was caused by cigarettes 
smoked before 1988, Philip Morris couldn't be held liable under 
Oregon law. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Oregon law allows plaintiffs to seek damages  
going back only eight years before the filing of a product 
liability suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the San Francisco case, U.S. juries have awarded damages  
in smoking liability cases only three times -- twice in Florida and 
once in New Jersey. All three verdicts were overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments in the Portland case, attorneys for the  
Williams family cited internal Philip Morris documents to bolster 
their claim that the company long knew about the cancer-causing 
potential of cigarettes and hid that information from its 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond Thomas called the tobacco company ``willful, malicious,  
sneaky'' in its efforts to keep smokers hooked. 
</P>
<P>
	Cofer said Williams was well aware that smoking could harm his  
health and had been warned of that by doctors and family members. 
</P>
<P>
	Cofer dismissed claims that Williams was addicted to nicotine as  
``psychobabble.'' The lawyer said Williams could have quit ``if 
he'd wanted to badly enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon's product liability laws require a plaintiff to be no  
more than 50 percent at fault to win damages. In California, a 
plaintiff can be as much as 99 percent at fault and still win 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry reached a $206 billion legal settlement  
with states in November, but cigarette makers still face individual 
and class-action claims.

<HEADLINE> Little Enthusiasm Shown for 10,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After three false alarms, it was hard to muster  
much enthusiasm for Dow 10,000 at the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	With the trading day winding down and the Dow Jones industrial  
average hovering just points above 10,000, roughly 25 traders 
sauntered into place on the exchange floor, mugging for the cameras 
perched above them in the press gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirks and groans filtered out as the Dow threatened to fall  
under 10,000 in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please don't die,'' pleaded one photographer who'd covered the  
assault on 10,000 one time too many. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the dignitaries who would ring in the would-be milestone  
didn't show up on the exchange balcony until there were just three 
minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
	Guilty of a premature celebration two weeks ago, NYSE Chairman  
Richard Grasso wouldn't begin flinging his ``Dow 10,000'' baseball 
caps until the milestone was a done deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, when it was, traders smattered some applause and scattered  
just as quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Grasso, New York City Mayor Rudolph Guiliani and Dow Jones &AMP; Co.  
index editor John Prestbo began tossing the caps to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	At a press conference soon after, Grasso thanked ``the members  
of the press for attending the warm-ups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As keeper of the Dow, Prestbo thanked ``Charlie Dow for  
inventing the thing in the first place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the NYSE, tourists gathered around the entrances with  
video cameras to record the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew the Dow was bouncing around 10,000, up and down, and  
thought we'd stop by and see if it makes history,'' said Sheela 
Raman, a 26-year-old programmer from Boston who was showing around 
visitors from the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> Negative Biopsy for Yankees' Zimmer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- New York Yankees interim manager Don  
Zimmer got good news from doctors after undergoing tests for a 
bleeding ulcer. 
</P>
<P>
	A biopsy on Zimmer's esophagus turned up negative, doctors said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is all right. My wife called me and everything is  
good,'' Zimmer said Tuesday before the Yankees played Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	The bleeding ulcer was discovered during the offseason. Zimmer  
will undergo an exam every six months. 
</P>
<P>
	New York also said pitcher Mike Jerzembeck will have surgery  
Tuesday in Birmingham, Ala., to remove bone chips from his right 
elbow. The right-hander was 0-1 with a 12.79 ERA last season in two 
starts and one relief appearance.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The approach of daylight savings time Sunday  
appears to be causing problems nationwide, the daily Reforma 
reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials or lawmakers in Mexico City and at least eight states  
are asking either to skip the summer time shift or have adjusted 
their own work hours to make it meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
	Another major border state, Sonora, has already been allowed to  
avoid the time change scheduled across Mexico on Sunday. Mexico 
City's legislature has asked Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas to fight 
daylight savings time. 
</P>
<P>
	A legislative commission in the border state of Nuevo Leon on  
Monday sent President Ernesto Zedillo a letter suggesting hours be 
left unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The states of Chiapas, Durango and Aguascalientes have decided  
not to challenge the new hours. But they said that schools and 
state offices would also change their hours to nullify the effect 
of daylight savings time. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics claim the time shift disrupts people's biological clocks  
and deny promoters' claims that it saves energy. 
</P>

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- One journalist has been shot and nine others  
have received death threats since January in a Peruvian jungle 
town, in what reporters are calling a campaign to silence them. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives from Peru's major human rights and press freedom  
groups traveled to Jaen, 460 miles northwest of Lima, to 
investigate Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The delegates said they did not yet know who was behind the  
attacks. The harassment began in January, but has become more 
frequent in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Luis Linares, a reporter for Jaen radio station Radio  
Maranon, was shot and wounded three weeks ago by hooded gunmen who 
broke into his home. Police say the gunmen were thieves, a 
conclusion that mission delegates question. 
</P>
<P>
	The reporters say they have received repeated anonymous death  
threats and their homes have been broken into. One journalist said 
his house was shot at. Eight of the 10 journalists work for the 
crusading Radio Maranon, which is run by the Catholic Church.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Leftist guerrillas shot at and then set  
fire to a convoy of 17 trucks from neighboring Ecuador, officials 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or  
FARC, ambushed the trailer trucks returning to Ecuador after 
delivering drilling equipment to Colombia's state-run petroleum 
company, the army and company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The drivers, working for the Ecuadorian trucking company, were  
reportedly rounded up by the rebels and released unharmed just over 
the Ecuadorian side of Colombia's southern border. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack occurred near Orito, a town 360 miles from Bogota in  
southern Putumayo state. The state-run company, Ecopetrol, plans to 
begin exploratory drilling in the area, said company spokesman 
William Giraldo. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil installations are a frequent target of guerrilla attacks.  
</P>
<P>
	Colombia's decades-old conflict has intensified in recent years,  
fueling concern in neighboring countries -- including Ecuador, 
Brazil, Peru, and Venezuela -- about rebel border crossings and 
attacks on their citizens and property.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Plummeting oil prices caused an 84  
percent drop in profits last year at Venezuela's huge state oil 
monopoly, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits at Petroleos de Venezuela, one of the top foreign  
suppliers of oil to the United States, fell from $4.8 billion in 
1997 to $766 million in 1998, company president Roberto Mandini 
said late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for Venezuelan oil hit a 12-year low last year, dropping  
to $7.66 a barrel and prompting President Hugo Chavez to slash $1.6 
billion from this year's $20 billion national budget. 
</P>
<P>
	That still leaves the government with a $9 billion fiscal  
deficit, which officials hope to reduce through budget cuts, more 
taxes and a crackdown on corruption and waste. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez says he is also counting on a modest rebound in oil  
prices, which have gone up 30 percent this month to $11.95 a barrel 
after Venezuela and other leading producers agreed to cut back 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil accounts for three-fourths of Venezuela's exports.

<HEADLINE> NBC Win Tightens Ratings Race / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The creator of ``The Simpsons'' may have another  
animated hit on his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The premiere of ``Futurama,'' the cartoon by Matt Groening,  
scored solid ratings Sunday during an encouraging week for new 
shows. The Fox comedy set in the year 3000 tied for 11th place in 
the Nielsen Media Research ratings last week, outdistancing even 
``The Simpsons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC won the week's prime-time competition with a 9.0 rating and  
15 share, tightening its race with CBS for the season's top spot by 
doing well on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, not normally its 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS was second with an 8.7 rating and 15 share, ABC had a 7.0  
rating and 12 share and Fox was at 6.5 and 11. The WB had a 3.0 
rating and 5 share, UPN was at 1.8 and 3 and Pax TV was at 0.8 and 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	Though not as impressive as ``Futurama,'' two new ABC comedies  
also had strong weeks. ``The Norm Show,'' the new comedy starring 
Norm McDonald, finished in 20th place and ``It's Like, You Know'' 
came in 33rd. 
</P>
<P>
	``ER'' was the week's most-watched show, as it has been for each  
of the 17 original episodes this year. However, it had the lowest 
rating for an ``ER'' original since 1994, perhaps an indication 
viewers are confused by the midseason reruns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nickelodeon cable network celebrated a Nielsen milestone --  
with milk and cookies, of course. It was the top-rated cable 
network, on an all-day basis, for the first three months of the 
year. That was Nick's 14th straight quarterly win. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, Fox News Channel defeated its rival MSNBC in  
the prime-time quarterly ratings. Fox's average prime-time audience 
has increased from 79,000 households in early 1998 to 223,000 
households this year. MSNBC's prime-time average was 201,000 
households. Both news networks trailed CNN, whose ratings were 
slightly down at 747,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
	MSNBC points out that it leads during all-day ratings, and has  
seen more of a boost than Fox over the past week in ratings because 
of the Yugoslavian bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' and ABC's ``World News Tonight'' finished  
in a dead heat in last week's evening news race with 8.2 ratings 
and 17 shares. The ``CBS Evening News'' had a 7.0 rating and 15 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC won for the quarter in nightly news. All three networks had  
lower ratings than last year, however. CBS's slip was the steepest. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of March 22-28, the top 10 shows, their networks  
and ratings were: ``ER,'' NBC, 18.6; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 16.2; ``60 
Minutes,'' CBS, 14.3; ``Friends,'' NBC, 14.1; ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' CBS, 13.7, ``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 13.4; ``Jesse,'' 
NBC, 12.9; ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 12.1; ``CBS Sunday Movie: 
Holy Joe,'' CBS, 11.3; ``Law and Order,'' NBC, 11.3.

<HEADLINE> Grains Fall; Soybeans Rise / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures prices retreated early today on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, while soybean futures gained. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and wheat moved lower in listless trading as market  
participants awaited Wednesday's release of the government's first 
planting intentions estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn also was pressured by mild weather across the Midwest that  
could aid early planting, while wheat suffered from improving 
conditions in the Plains that would help growth of the winter wheat 
crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans moved higher. While many investors expect the  
government to report soybean acreage this year may reach a record, 
some market participants were leery of being caught short. Soybeans 
futures remained under pressure from reports that Brazilian 
harvesting was proceeding at a fast clip. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 1/2 cent to $3.03 1/2 a bushel; May corn  
fell 1/2 cent to $2.31 1/2 a bushel; May oats fell 1/4 cent to $1.23 1/4 a 
bushel; May soybeans rose 2 1/4 cents to $4.98 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures were mostly higher on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while pork futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle rose .35 cent to 67.12 cents a pound; April  
feeder cattle rose .53 cent to 72.25 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell .67 cent to 53.05 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell .87 
cent to 53.60 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Bank One To Cut 4,700 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Bank One, which has been quietly eliminating jobs  
following the merger between First Chicago NBD Corp. and Banc One, 
says it is well on the way to achieving the cost savings expected 
from that deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first public acknowledgment that it has been cutting  
jobs, the nation's fourth-largest bank said Monday it hopes to 
reduce its work force by 5 percent, or 4,700 jobs, by the middle of 
next year as it integrates systems and operations across a 14-state 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the job cuts came in annual filings that Bank One made  
Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But spokesman 
Stan Lata said Wall Street analysts had been informed earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really haven't put together a list of specifics where the  
jobs have been either outsourced or eliminated, but where branches 
have been sold is pretty obvious,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago-based company's stock initially rose on the New York  
Stock Exchange as word of the cuts spread. But it closed down 56 1/4 
cents, or 1 percent, at $55.43 3/4 a share in a mostly down stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One has been trying to convince Wall Street that it can  
make good on its promises of higher earnings and $930 million in 
annual cost savings despite a history of problems that First 
Chicago NBD and Banc One encountered in absorbing smaller 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lata said the company already had eliminated 2,690 of the jobs  
by December and was working to reach its staffing goals through the 
sale of bank branches, attrition, outsourcing and consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One took a pretax restructuring charge of $984 million in  
the fourth quarter of 1998 and expects to record another $526 
million in merger-related charges this year, the company said in 
its filing. Of the $526 million this year, $54 million will be 
costs to integrate systems. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past few months, the bank has eliminated jobs in  
corporate lending and overseas trading. 
</P>
<P>
	It also had significant overlap in Indiana, the only state where  
the two former banks competed heavily against each other, and saw 
jobs reduced after selling branches there. Many of those jobs went 
to banks that bought the branches, Lata noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the company has been expanding staff in Ohio for its  
retail banking, operations and investments business. 
</P>
<P>
	John Challenger, president of the outplacement firm Challenger,  
Gray &AMP; Christmas, said job cuts this year are likely to remain high 
as companies continue to merge to cut costs and satisfy Wall 
Street's demands for increased profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One, like other banks that have recently merged, hopes to  
become a center for one-stop shopping for financial services such 
as loans, credit and mutual funds. But analysts have said that will 
take time as the companies merge their cultures and operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One has $260 billion in assets, more than 2,000 branches  
and 9,150 automated teller machines in the Midwest, South and 
Southwest. It is the nation's second-largest credit-card issuer, 
owning the First Chicago card and First USA credit operations.

<HEADLINE> Huskies Get Huge Welcome Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Oh, what a ride for Jim Calhoun and the  
Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
	A bus carrying Calhoun and his national champions traveled the  
35 miles from the airport to campus Tuesday, but it took them 
through the heart and hearts of Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorists pulled off along the highway. Families, jumping and  
waving, ran from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The journey back home was incredible,'' said Calhoun.  
</P>
<P>
	And once inside Gampel Pavilion, the team was embraced by a  
standing-room-only crowd of more than 10,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun reflected on the journey he began 13 years ago to build  
the No. 1 team. A big bump in the road was the 1990 heartbreaking 
loss to Duke. A buzzer-beater by Christian Laettner kept the 
Huskies from the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``We returned to Storrs to mend our broken heart,'' said  
Calhoun. ``Yesterday, we kicked some butt and broke some hearts. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut upset Duke 77-74 in the championship game Monday  
night in St. Petersburg, Fla., surprising many who felt the Blue 
Devils were all but unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the first for the men's team in school history  
and the first for a New England team since Holy Cross won the 
tournament in 1947. The UConn women brought home the national title 
in 1995 with a 35-0 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The team and coaches sat on a raised platform in front of the  
student section, the same section Calhoun has saluted each time he 
has walked off after a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't wait to come back home to you and bring back the  
national championship back,'' Calhoun told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans rocked, rapped and waved signs throughout the rally. At one  
point, thousands began chanting ``One more year!'' -- directed at 
scoring leader Richard Hamilton, the Final Four MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton flirted with leaving before his junior year for the  
NBA. Speculation on whether he or sophomore guard Khalid El-Amin 
will return for another year has heightened during the Huskies' 
successful run. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun said neither one has approached him yet on the subject.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my job to convince them to stay. It never has and  
never will,'' he said. ``These are young people going through the 
process. It is their decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Tuesday was not about saying goodbye to anyone. It was  
Thanksgiving in Connecticut and recognizing the top team in the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
	``You stood by us. You believed,'' senior point guard Ricky  
Moore said. ``We didn't let you down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, at Bradley International Airport, about 2,000 fans  
cheered and screamed as the players mingled in the crowd. Leigh 
Anne Crocco of West Haven jumped frantically up and down as her 
hero, Jake Voskuhl, gave her a high-five. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-year-old was breathless for a moment before announcing,  
``Jake touched my hand!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of fans surged forward seeking hugs and autographs.  
``Yes! Yes!'' shouted Ralph Rousa of Waterbury, who managed to get 
Hamilton's autograph for his 6-year-old son, Nicholas, and 
El-Amin's autograph for his 3-year-old son, Michael. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of the pep rally, the team walked off the podium  
and shook hands with some of the fans and proceeded in a slow 
victory lap around the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it was all said and done, Duke had a magnificent season --  
up to a point,'' said Calhoun. ``The great thing about our sport is 
you settle things on the court. This was supposed to be the year of 
the Blue Devils.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to one of the scores of signs and banners held up in  
Gampel, ``1999 was the Year of the Dog.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Premier Meets With Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Russia's prime minister launched a  
diplomatic bid today to end NATO's air campaign in Yugoslavia, as 
Western forces expanded attacks on Serb forces accused of forcing 
ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	A Yugoslav official for the first time acknowledged that  
atrocities by Yugoslav troops and Serb police in Kosovo may be 
occurring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Emotions rise up extremely, and it's possible that there are  
circumstances to crack down, maybe atrocities, but it is not a 
state strategy,'' Deputy Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic said in an 
interview broadcast on Israel's Army Radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of mass killings and forced removals, with entire  
villages being burned and cities cleared of ethnic Albanians, have 
increased since NATO forces began the bombing and missile campaign 
last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	With international monitors having left Kosovo and virtually all  
foreign journalists kicked out, the reports are impossible to 
verify. But the consistency in details of an apparent systematic 
Serb campaign to rid some parts of Kosovo of ethnic Albanians gave 
credence to allegations by Western leaders of ethnic cleansing. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov began discussions with  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic this morning with the goal of 
``an immediate halt'' to the bombing of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have arrived here ... in order to transfer the process into  
a political course ... to find an acceptable decision in the course 
of political consultations,'' Primakov was quoted as saying by 
Russia's ITAR-Tass news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks are the most high-level mediation effort since the  
NATO airstrikes began. Primakov was to head to Bonn, Germany, after 
meeting Milosevic for talks with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, the 
current president of the European Union, a German government 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The upheaval that some Western relief officials say threatens to  
become Europe's worst humanitarian crisis since World War II 
continued to spread, with waves of refugees further stretching the 
ability of overburdened neighbors -- Albania, Macedonia and 
Montenegro -- to care for them. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO expanded its attacks on Serb units that are allegedly  
forcing ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo. Another air raid siren 
sounded this afternoon in Nis, which is near a major military base 
in Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	An international charity said at least nine ethnic Serb refugees  
had been killed as a result of the alliance's airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Pratt, director of CARE's operation in Yugoslavia, was  
quoted by the Australian broadcaster ABC radio as saying that the 
charity's staff had confirmed nine people died when NATO hit 
buildings near centers housing Serb refugees from earlier conflicts 
in Croatia and Bosnia. The staff heard there were six more deaths 
at other refugee centers, but had been unable to confirm them, 
Pratt said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Geneva, the U.N. relief agency said it was unable to confirm  
the Australian group's information. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's military today repeated its claim that 1,000 civilians  
and more than 50 Yugoslav or Serb fighters had been killed by the 
airstrikes. Yugoslavia hasn't given an overall estimate, and it was 
impossible to independently confirm casualty figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Western officials were watching Primakov's initiative closely.  
</P>
<P>
	But British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told BBC Radio 4's  
Today program he saw ``no signs'' that Belgrade would accede to 
NATO demands to cease hostilities, grant Kosovo autonomy and allow 
NATO troops into Kosovo to keep the peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, we could not accept simply Milosevic calling a  
cease-fire leaving him in control of the territory which he's 
cleansed of the Kosovo Albanians,'' Cook said. ``Any settlement now 
must involve the ability of those refugees to return in security, 
free from fear, with an international guarantee, to their homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	French President Jacques Chirac took a harder line.  
</P>
<P>
	Europe ``cannot accept on its soil a man and a regime that, for  
nearly 10 years, has conducted ... operations of ethnic cleansing, 
murders and massacres, of destabilization in the entire region, 
resulting in more than 200,000 deaths and millions left homeless,'' 
Chirac said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav government remained defiant, issuing an order  
Monday night prohibiting men of military age from leaving the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our country must be defended to the last man and the last  
available piece of arsenal,'' said Col. Gen. Spasoje Smiljanic, 
head of the air force and air defenses. He said the raids had so 
far killed seven air force personnel, injured 17 and caused $300 
million worth of damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the airstrikes Monday night and early today were two  
detonations at Pancevo, 6 miles north of Belgrade. In Podgorica, 
capital of Montenegro, local media reported at least four missiles 
hit the area around the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kosovo, two missiles hit Pristina army barracks early today,  
damaging surrounding civilian targets, but no information on 
casualties was given. The provincial capital has been without 
electricity since Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgrade's suburban military air base Batajnica was targeted,  
with five missiles hitting in the area, Serbian state-run 
television said. There were no immediate reports on damage or 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	The tank-killing A-10 aircraft joined the NATO force taking off  
late Monday from the base at Aviano, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	A NATO spokesman in Brussels, Air Commodore David Wilby, said  
the alliance was going after units that had committed atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	More U.S. aircraft, including five B-1 bombers, were being  
deployed to the mission, the Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
	British Harrier jets were forced to turn back to their Italian  
base before they reached the Yugoslav border early today because of 
heavy cloud cover over their intended targets, said Group Captain 
Travers Smith at Gioia del Colle, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 60,000 Kosovo Albanian refugees have arrived in northern  
Albania since the attacks began last Wednesday, straining the 
already desperate resources of one of Europe's poorest countries, 
the U.N. refugee agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia, on Kosovo's southeastern border, said it had reached  
its 20,000 limit on refugees and would need help from neighboring 
countries and the European Union to cope with any more. 
</P>
<P>
	Other refugees crossed into Montenegro to the west.  
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav officials have accused NATO of only inflaming the  
ethnic crisis in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels have been 
fighting for independence from Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people  
inhabitants. Serbs, however, consider Kosovo rightfully theirs 
because it was the birthplace of their national culture before they 
lost it to the Ottoman Turks in 1389. Serbia regained the province 
shortly before World War I.

<HEADLINE> Conviction Reinstated in Gun Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People accused in multistate crime sprees can  
be prosecuted in any of those states for using a gun even if they 
had or used the gun in only one state, the Supreme Court ruled 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-2 decision reinstated the federal gun conviction and  
accompanying five-year prison sentence of a man also convicted of 
kidnapping and conspiracy for crimes stemming from a 1994 drug deal 
gone bad. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue was a federal law making it a crime to use or carry a  
gun ``during and in relation to any crime of violence.'' Conviction 
on the gun charge means an extra five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacinto Rodriguez-Moreno and others kidnapped the middleman in a  
cocaine deal after someone else ran off with the drugs without 
paying for them. The kidnapped man, Ephrain Avendano, was taken 
from Houston to New Jersey, where his wife and children also were 
help captive. 
</P>
<P>
	Avendano later was taken to New York and then to Maryland, where  
prosecutors say Rodriguez-Moreno obtained a gun and threatened to 
kill him. Avendano escaped, and Maryland police subsequently 
arrested Rodriguez-Moreno and five accomplices. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecuted in federal court in New Jersey, Rodriguez-Moreno was  
convicted and sentenced to 12 years and three months in prison -- 
including five years for using a gun during a violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld some of his  
convictions but threw out the gun conviction and the five-year 
sentence it drew. The appeals court said he could not be prosecuted 
anywhere but Maryland on the gun charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution gives criminal defendants the right to be tried  
in the state and judicial district where their alleged crimes were 
committed, although courts are authorized to switch trial sites to 
preserve fairness. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the nation's highest court Tuesday, Justice Clarence  
Thomas said the appeals court was wrong because the underlying 
crime of kidnapping -- an essential part of the gun crime -- had 
occurred in four states. 
</P>
<P>
	``A kidnapping, once begun, does not end until the victim is  
free,'' Thomas said. ``It does not make sense then, to speak of it 
in discrete geographic fragments ... It does not matter that ... 
(Rodriguez-Moreno) used the .357 Magnum revolver ... only in 
Maryland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was a victory for the Justice Department lawyers who  
had appealed the 3rd Circuit court's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices Antonin Scalia and John Paul Stevens dissented. Writing  
for the two, Scalia said, ``It seems ... unmistakably clear from 
the text of the law that this crime can be committed only where the 
defendant both engages in the acts making up the predicate offense 
and uses or carries a gun.''

<HEADLINE> Subaru, Infiniti Unveil New Models </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Subaru introduced the third generation of its  
U.S.-built Legacy sedan and wagon Tuesday, Infiniti showed off its 
redesigned I-30 luxury sedan with an anti-whiplash system, while 
Saab unveiled a souped-up 9-3 coupe. 
</P>
<P>
	The new model introductions by foreign automakers helped kick  
off the media preview of the New York International Auto Show. 
</P>
<P>
	The North American versions of the Legacy are slightly wider but  
very similar in design to their sister cars sold in Japan, which 
went on sale last year. They are larger inside and out than their 
predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 Legacy, built near Lafayette, Ind., goes on sale in the  
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Infiniti, the luxury division of Nissan Motor Co., said its 2000  
I-30 will go on sale by September. The Infiniti shares its chassis 
and major parts with the Nissan Maxima; the new version has a 
substantially different body design. 
</P>
<P>
	The redesigned I-30 features a safety system that moves the  
seat's head restraint up and forward in a rear-end collision to 
help prevent whiplash; it returns to its normal position after the 
crash. Nissan says tests show it can substantially reduce the 
threat of neck injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The system, made by Lear Corp., also will be standard on the  
2000 Q45 sedan and may be extended to other Nissan vehicles in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan also has upgraded the I-30's 3-liter V6 engine to produce  
227 horsepower. The front-drive sedan is built in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Saab's 9-3 Viggen is named after a Saab-built jet fighter. With  
lots of extra body cladding and a 2.3-liter, turbocharged, 
high-output four-cylinder engine that generates 225 horsepower, the 
9-3 Viggen will be produced in limited numbers for select dealers. 
It goes on sale in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swedish automaker is half-owned by General Motors Corp.  
</P>
<P>
	The show opens to the public Saturday and runs through April 11.

<HEADLINE> Feds Want To Help Farmers This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is considering  
additional ways to help farmers as producers gear up for another 
year of expected low prices, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we'd like to do is be out a little more in front of the  
issue,'' Glickman told reporters, adding that President Clinton 
telephoned him over the weekend to discuss farm issues. ``The 
issues of the farm program are getting a lot more attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Glickman warned that it is unlikely there will be major  
revisions to the 1996 farm law that gradually phases out government 
subsidies to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any movement to roll back the Farm Bill,''  
Glickman said. ``But I do think it's imperative that we plug its 
holes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the administration will likely put forth some specific  
proposals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Clinton administration and Congress have expressed  
interest in overhauling a crop insurance program for farmers so 
that producers will have adequate coverage during hard times. But 
crop insurance isn't the only solution, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``While crop insurance will continue to be the centerpiece of  
the safety net, we're looking at a broad range of risk management 
tools,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, Congress passed a $6 billion emergency aid package  
for farmers. The money came as farmers were experiencing record low 
prices along with disease and bad weather in some areas. The 
government already has predicted the low price problem will linger 
this year, largely due to the Asian economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Low prices also have hit the livestock sector, particularly hog  
farmers who have gotten their lowest prices in four decades in the 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of Congress already have expressed support for  
another emergency aid package for farmers.

<HEADLINE> Emerging Market Funds Rally a Bit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For investors in emerging markets mutual funds,  
the last five years have been Murphy's Law in action. Whatever 
could go wrong did go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble started with the Mexican peso crisis in 1994. It  
segued into Asian financial woes (1997 to present), Russia's 
default on its foreign debt in 1998, then currency devaluation in 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The net result: What once had been regarded as a promising road  
for investors seemed to have turned into a desolate dead end. 
</P>
<P>
	But emerging-markets stock funds, bruised and battered as they  
may be, haven't dropped off the financial map altogether. In recent 
months, they have staged a respectable rally, though many clouds 
still remain in the outlook for this whole style of investing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not pleasant to lose people's money. I think about that a  
lot,'' says Travis Selmier, manager of the $240 million USAA 
Emerging Markets Fund and of other international investments for 
the fund family run by USAA Investment Management in San Antonio, 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I generally feel that my investors know their risks, and a  
lot of people have stuck with it. I know at some point this is 
going to be a good investment for people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the five-year period ended Feb. 28, Morningstar Mutual  
Funds' composite of 165 diversified emerging markets stock funds 
averaged a negative total return of more than 10 percent a year, 
capped off by a drop of just under 30 percent in the latest 
12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
	The pain of that awful showing was compounded by the contrast to  
how well U.S. stock funds fared over the same period, averaging a 
gain of 16 percent a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody who puts money in volatile investments like  
emerging-markets funds is routinely advised to be ready to ride out 
short-term storms. But five years of repeated disappointment 
stretches the definition of ``short-term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet despite all that, emerging-markets stock investments haven't  
lost all their allure for contrarian-minded investors, who love to 
pick through the debris of investment debacles for bargains. In the 
past six months, Morningstar's emerging-markets average has enjoyed 
a bounce of almost 14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The macroeconomic fundamentals in most of the emerging markets  
are as bad as they can be -- some are still deteriorating and some 
are starting to recover,'' says Mark Madden, portfolio manager of 
the Pioneer Emerging Markets Fund in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``But equity assets in most emerging markets are attractively  
valued. Given current valuations in many of these markets, we 
expect that over the next three to five years their potential 
returns could again be attractive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selmier at USAA says he has learned some useful lessons through  
all the recent trouble. When picking individual stocks to buy, sell 
or avoid, he says, ``we look more at macroeconomic and political 
trends. The country-by-country asset allocation decision has gotten 
more important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 105 or so stocks in his fund's portfolio, the  
countries with the greatest current representation are, in order: 
Mexico, South Africa, Brazil, Israel, Hong Kong-China, and South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	One lesson from recent history that any fund investor can heed:  
As with other types of high-risk investments, it's hard to do well 
in emerging-markets investing if you wait until the field looks 
safe before you venture into it. The last time a solidly bullish 
consensus prevailed about emerging markets was 1993, which turned 
out to be a terrible time to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	But it still stands to reason that there will be many success  
stories arising from emerging-markets economies in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	In the words of Angus Tulloch, who handles Asian and  
emerging-markets investments for Babson-Stewart Ivory 
International, a Scottish-U.S. joint money-management venture: 
``The question this year for global emerging markets is whether, 
after five dismal years, there may be light at the end of a long. 
dark tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the whole, we expect a further volatile year in emerging  
markets, but good buying opportunities will certainly arise.''

<HEADLINE> `It's Like' Is Seinfeld in Sunshine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The golden slackers of ``It's Like, You Know  
...'' are gathered around the TV on this week's episode. No wonder. 
They've lucked into live coverage of a freeway car chase. 
</P>
<P>
	``A high-speed chase brings L.A. to a grinding halt,'' Robbie  
tells the newcomer, Arthur. ``It's like our version of a snow 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robbie grabs the phone to alert his pal Shrug.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's getting a massage,'' Arthur says.  
</P>
<P>
	``High-speed chases take precedence over everything,'' says  
Robbie as he hits his speed-dial. 
</P>
<P>
	Airing Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. EST on ABC, where it premiered  
last week, the improbably titled sitcom ``It's Like, You Know...'' 
drolly dwells on the tried-and-true notion that people in Southern 
California are different from the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, ``It's Like'' reminds us, the vapid, perfectly  
formed residents fill each moment with enterprising indolence. And 
to enable their systematized idleness, every conceivable service is 
within easy reach. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, next week's very funny episode introduces the rest  
of the nation to Angelinos' cure for a painful memory: They consult 
an amnesiologist and get amnectomied. 
</P>
<P>
	Presumably, that's make-believe. But in at least one case,  
reality outpaces ``It's Like.'' In real life, you don't need to 
call your friends about a car chase on TV, nor do you need them to 
call you. 
</P>
<P>
	Check out this Web-site pitch: ``Do you hate learning you missed  
watching a wild three-hour chase that happened four hours earlier? 
For the price of a cup of coffee each month, we'll notify you by 
pager during live high-speed chases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the pledge of PursuitWatch Network, a real-life business  
venture serving L.A. 
</P>
<P>
	Who could fail to love, hate and love hating such a paradise?  
Certainly not Arthur, the dyspeptic New York journalist played by 
Chris Eigeman. Fresh from Manhattan to research a book (``Living in 
Los Angeles -- How Can You Stomach It?''), he is crashing at a 
luxury pad with Robbie, his one-time college roommate (played by 
Steven Eckholdt). 
</P>
<P>
	They both are crashing in that luxury pad with its owner, Shrug  
(Evan Handler), who, thanks to his trust fund, has never worked a 
day in his life. One other thing: Shrug is bald. Lost all his hair. 
From stress, he explains. 
</P>
<P>
	The foxy Lauren (A.J. Langer) is a combination massage therapist  
and process server -- sometimes all at once. 
</P>
<P>
	And rounding out this quintet is its most original, yet  
blatantly cribbed, member: next-door neighbor Jennifer Grey. Like, 
you know, the actress. The actress who, until her nose job, used to 
look like the actress who starred in ``Dirty Dancing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever fans Jennifer has left don't recognize her,  
post-rhinoplasty. Her career has stalled. She spends her time 
trying to remind everybody who she is (or used to be). 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer is played by Jennifer Grey. The actress. The actress  
who used to look like Jennifer Grey. 
</P>
<P>
	Never on series TV has an actress so nakedly played for laughs  
her personal quandary. Grey as Grey: Is she a heckuva sport? A 
poster girl for self-immolation? On the vanguard of whatever 
follows postmodernism? Desperate for work? 
</P>
<P>
	You make the call. But this much is clear: When it comes to  
mirroring her life in a sitcom, Grey easily out-Seinfelds Jerry 
Seinfeld. Which brings us to the new show's ``Seinfeld'' 
connection. 
</P>
<P>
	Inasmuch as it dwells on all things stereotypically Los Angeles,  
``It's Like'' appears to be a West Coast edition of ``Seinfeld,'' 
which spent nine years fixating on Jerry's Manhattan universe. 
</P>
<P>
	This kinship comes honestly. ``It's Like, You Know...'' was  
created by Peter Mehlman, a ``Seinfeld'' writer of ``yada-yada'' 
fame. So on last week's ``It's Like'' no one should have been 
surprised to hear Robbie muse, ``Don't you think the letter Q 
should come a lot farther down in the alphabet?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the entire ``Like'' ensemble seems to have direct  
forebears in ``Seinfeld.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glib, fastidious Robbie fills the role of Seinfeld-as-goy. Shrug  
is Kramer with no hair but lots of money. Arthur is George with a 
marketable skill. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren (flaky yet resourceful) and Jennifer (driven but  
continually frustrated) represent the two halves of Elaine, all the 
more so since they're often at war with one another. 
</P>
<P>
	Fine. But why don't these self-obsessed people realize that when  
they open their mouths they sound just like characters on 
``Seinfeld''? You almost expect this kind of exchange: 
</P>
<P>
	Robbie: ``You ever think how we resemble an L.A. version of  
`Seinfeld'?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer (forlorn): ``I was up for a guest shot on `Seinfeld,'  
but Estelle Getty beat me out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shrug: ``No soup-er role for you. Step aside!''  
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe they used to watch ``Seinfeld,'' but have since  
forgotten everything about it. It's like, you know, they got 
amnectomied. 
</P>
<P>

who writes and preaches that people have a God-given right to kill

<HEADLINE> CPSC To Alert Consumers of Recalls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Consumer Product Safety Commission is  
launching a campaign to raise awareness about product recalls, 
contending that despite the government's recall warnings consumers 
continue to use hazardous products and put themselves at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission was announcing its recall roundup today to  
highlight some of the millions of recalled products consumers may 
still be using, from playpens with protruding rivets to an 
under-the-counter toaster that can start fires. 
</P>
<P>
	As the agency responsible for protecting the public, the CPSC  
announces about 300 recalls each year as it works with companies to 
ensure that new products with the same safety dangers do not end up 
on store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	But getting consumers to dispose of faulty products is another  
story. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can get dangerous products off store shelves, but the real  
challenge is to get them out of families' homes,'' says Ann Brown, 
the chairwoman. The commission sometimes learns of deaths or 
injuries caused by products after they have been recalled, she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands, sometimes even millions, of units of a product can be  
recalled at once, making it difficult to reach everyone who bought 
them and is at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the commission has recalled nearly 10 million sets  
of play yards or playpens, by various manufacturers, because of 
protruding rivets that can pose a strangulation hazard, such as to 
children wearing loose clothing who could become entangled. The 
products have caused eight deaths, according to the CPSC. 
</P>
<P>
	They are made by Bilt-Rite, Evenflo, Gerry, Graco, Kolcraft,  
Playskool, Pride-Trimble and Strolee. Consumers can get a free 
repair kit by calling 1-800-794-4115. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 million battery-powered Power Wheels vehicles by

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Plans Auction Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon.com Inc. is taking a giant step toward  
building itself into an Internet retailing empire, with plans to 
launch an auction service and purchase a 50 percent stake in an 
online pet store. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com's stock rose almost 8 percent Monday on the news that  
the Internet powerhouse -- which just a year ago only sold books -- 
is quickly becoming a diversified online shopping hub. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their objective is to become the dominant shopping destination  
today, and that's what they are doing,'' said Lauren Cooks Levitan, 
vice president at BancBoston Robertson Stephens in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Amazon.com bought a 46 percent stake in  
drugstore.com, a new Web site selling pharmaceuticals and beauty 
aids. In the last year, it has also added videos, music and some 
gift items to its site. It also launched a ``Shop the Web'' service 
that links to other Internet merchants. Its newest purchase gives 
it a 50 percent stake in Pets.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors cheered Amazon.com's moves on Monday, sending its  
shares up $10.56 1/4 to $149.62 1/2 in trading on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Also fueling the stock gain was Amazon.com's revelation that its  
customer database had grown to 8 million, well above the 6.2 
million tallied at the end of the fourth quarter and above most 
analysts' expectations, Levitan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new auction service, which was announced late Sunday, will  
let people buy and sell virtually anything online. More than 800 
product categories are planned. Some offerings already slated 
include a signed picture of Albert Einstein, a 1968 corvette and 
special edition Furby dolls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course we sell books, music and videos, but what auctions  
allow us to do is to get into hundreds of categories easily,'' said 
David Risher, Amazon.com's senior vice president of product 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com will launch the auction site on Tuesday. Consumers  
will access the auctions from Amazon.com's home page. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike other sites, Amazon.com will offer its shoppers a  
``guarantee'' against fraud by sellers. Amazon.com will reimburse 
customers up to $250 if they can establish that they did not 
receive an item or did not get what they believed they had ordered. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amazon.com guarantee comes amid a sharp rise in consumer  
complaints of online fraud. Last year, two out of every three 
complaints were prompted by problems with online auctions, 
according to the Internet Fraud Watch, an online fraud reporting 
system created by the National Consumers League. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Amazon.com's safeguards, analysts still warned of the  
risks associated with entering the auction business. For one, 
Amazon.com will be forced to go head-to-head with eBay, the biggest 
and most experienced and successful of the online auctioneers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Amazon.com will lose much of its control over  
customer service and merchandise selection in the auction area of 
the business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amazon always has always had a great deal of control over the  
customer experience,'' said Ken Cassar, an analyst at the Internet 
research firm Jupiter Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``But now they are moving from a retailer to a broker,'' he  
said. ``With that, they take on the risk that one party of another 
will not live up to their commitment and that can hurt Amazon's 
reputation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Pets.com deal announced Monday, Amazon.com will buy a  
50 percent stake in the Internet's largest pet supply company. 
Terms of the agreement were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, products and services for pets totaled $23 billion in  
the United States, with only a small fraction taking place on the 
Internet.

<HEADLINE> Amy Fisher's Release Gets Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) -- Amy Fisher appeared closer to freedom  
Tuesday, with the forgiveness of the woman she shot and support 
from prosecutors who said she was denied effective legal advice 
when she pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fisher has been in jail for almost seven years for shooting  
Mary Jo Buttafuoco, the wife of her lover. The case drew national 
attention and she was dubbed ``Long Island Lolita'' for her affair 
with Joey Buttafuoco. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors filed papers Tuesday supporting Ms. Fisher's motion  
to vacate her guilty plea, saying she provided compelling evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they also were persuaded by Mrs. Buttafuoco  
``not to oppose the defendant's motion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said in a letter that she forgave Ms. Fisher after meeting  
with her mother and corresponding with Ms. Fisher for several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fisher -- now 24 -- was 16 when she shot Mrs. Buttafuoco in  
the head on May 19, 1992, in a jealous rage outside the 
Buttafuocos' Long Island home. 
</P>
<P>
	Supreme Court Justice Ira Wexner is scheduled to rule on the  
motion April 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fisher, in her motion, said she was duped by her former  
lawyer into believing that if she pleaded guilty to first-degree 
assault, prosecutors would help her enter a work release program 
and earn parole within three years. 
</P>
<P>
	She was sentenced to five to 15 years in prison. District  
Attorney Denis Dillon said Tuesday his office had never promised 
the lawyer a work release sentence.

<HEADLINE> Probe Widens in N.M. Torture Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELEPHANT BUTTE, N.M. (AP) -- An investigation into a New Mexico  
woman's claims of kidnapping and sexual torture now spans three 
states and bones have been found outside the home of the suspects, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bone fragments were to be tested today to determine if they  
are human, a source close to the case told The Associated Press on 
condition of anonymity late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bones were allegedly discovered outside the home of state  
maintenance worker David Parker Ray, 59. He and a live-in 
companion, Cindy Lea Hendy, 39, face kidnapping and sex-related 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agent Doug Beldon said the FBI has not ruled out homicides  
in the investigation that has been extended to Texas and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	John Branaugh, a friend of Hendy's, told KOB-TV of Albuquerque  
that Hendy told him there were other victims whose bodies were 
dumped in Elephant Butte Lake, some 150 miles south of Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ray has put four to six bodies in this lake and others buried  
in the desert,'' Branaugh told KOB. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Costales, Ray's court-appointed attorney, said his client  
was innocent of any wrongdoing and dismissed the claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not believe any of it is founded on anything more than  
rumors, sensationalism,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Albuquerque woman told authorities she met Ray and Hendy in  
Albuquerque and joined them in a recreational vehicle, where Ray 
showed her a badge and told her she was under arrest for 
solicitation as a prostitute. She said she was taken to the 
couple's Elephant Butte home and tortured over three days. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she escaped March 22, wearing only a padlocked metal  
collar attached to a chain. Another woman has since come forward 
accusing Ray of torturing her, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	State public safety director Darren White said dozens of FBI  
agents and state police were working on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the people involved are trying to put the pieces together  
in a very sick and disturbing puzzle,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray and Hendy were being held in the Sierra County jail in lieu  
of $1 million bond each.

<HEADLINE> E. Carolina Hires Herrion As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- East Carolina hired Bill Herrion, coach  
at Drexel for eight seasons, as men's basketball coach on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrion, 41, succeeds Joe Dooley, who had the final year of his  
contract bought out after four seasons and a 57-52 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are extremely excited to have a coach with the credentials  
of Bill Herrion. His record at Drexel speaks for itself,'' East 
Carolina athletic director Mike Hamrick said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrion had a 167-71 career record at Drexel, guiding the  
Dragons to six 20-win seasons, three regular-season America East 
Conference titles nd three NCAA tournament appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Herrion will be remembered as an outstanding coach and  
someone who represented college basketball and Drexel University 
with dignity and class,'' Drexel athletics director Eric Zillmer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrion landed a two-year contract extension from Drexel in 1997  
after turning down the coaching job at Rutgers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was recommended last season for the vacant job at St. John's  
by Mike Jarvis, who wound up with the Red Storm job himself. 
Herrion was Jarvis' assistant at Boston University and at George 
Washington.

<HEADLINE>  Another Milestone for Gretzky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky has achieved some 60-odd records  
during his 21-year hockey career. And this latest milestone could 
stand a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	``This obviously is going to be a tough record for anybody to  
break,'' Gretzky said of his 1,072 career goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky overtook Gordie Howe when he scored the game-winning  
goal Monday night in the New York Rangers' 3-1 victory over the New 
York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	The staggering total, accumulated during 20 NHL seasons and one  
in the WHA, includes regular-season and playoff goals. Howe scored 
his total during his 26 years in the NHL and WHA. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky's latest achievement is not considered a record by the  
NHL because the league does not recognize the WHA. However, it 
remains very much a record in Gretzky's mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it won't be in the books,'' Gretzky said, ``but people  
will sit around and talk about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was yet another piece of hockey history Gretzky has stolen  
from Howe. Gretzky has long since broken Howe's NHL record of 801 
goals for the regular season. Gretzky now has 894. 
</P>
<P>
	Although called ``The Great One,'' Gretzky still thinks that  
nickname should belong to Howe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gordie is one of the classiest people the game could ever  
have,'' Gretzky said. ``I've always said he's the best player to 
ever play the game. He's my idol.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky had 56 goals in the WHA with Indianapolis and Edmonton  
to go along with his overall total of 1,016 in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Howe had 174 regular-season goals in the WHA with the Houston  
Aeros and New England Whalers. In the postseason he had 28 goals, 
20 with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky tied Howe's mark when he scored his 1,071st against  
Vancouver on Feb. 4. Then he suddenly went dry and went on the 
injury list, missing 12 games with a disc injury in his neck. Along 
with that, he went without a goal in 11 other games. 
</P>
<P>
	So Monday night's goal was a relief for Gretzky. At the same  
time, it helped the Rangers in the playoff race. They moved five 
points behind Boston for the eighth and final spot in the Eastern 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a nice goal at nice time,'' Gretzky said.  
</P>
<P>
	It was only the ninth goal of the season for Gretzky, who once  
scored a record 92 one year with the Edmonton Oilers. And Gretzky 
thinks that's one of his records that is still assailable. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got 92 goals, there was a stretch of a few games there  
where I didn't score,'' Gretzky said. ``(Philadelphia's Eric) 
Lindros and (Pittsburgh's Jaromir) Jagr, they have a shot at the 
92. Everything has to go right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky remembers when he first started out as pro, with  
Indianapolis at age 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just happy to be playing hockey professionally,''  
Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
	His first goal?  
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't very pretty,'' he recalled. ``It was just a backhand  
from the slot on a 2-on-2.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, 1,071 goals and 20 seasons later, Gretzky stands alone.

<HEADLINE> FCC To Review Cable Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators will continue to review  
complaints about cable TV rate increases even though the government 
will no longer try to hold down Americans' monthly cable bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission said Monday that it will  
wrap up pending rate complaints and accept new ones contesting 
increases that occur on or before Wednesday -- the day when federal 
price controls end. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC has 443 pending complaints. The commission couldn't  
immediately say how many customers and companies are affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting Wednesday, federal price controls will be lifted for  
the expanded basic services that include many popular cable TV 
channels such as Discovery, CNN, MTV and ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are the services that the FCC will continue to accept rate  
complaints for. 
</P>
<P>
	As has been the case since 1996, consumers can't file complaints  
directly to the FCC but must ask their state or local governments 
to do so for them. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law not only paved the rate for cable rates to be  
deregulated on Wednesday but it also took away consumers' power to 
directly file cable rate complaints to the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the FCC began regulating cable TV rates in 1993, it has  
resolved nearly 18,000 complaints involving 5,700 communities. As a 
result, the FCC has ordered $100 million in refunds. 
</P>
<P>
	The most basic level of service, meanwhile, which includes  
mostly broadcast TV channels and a few cable networks, will 
continue to be regulated. So will prices for set-top boxes and 
remote controls. The exception: if a local cable company competes 
against another local provider. 
</P>
<P>
	Premium channels such as HBO and Showtime were never subject to  
federal price regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Center for Responsive Politics, a group that  
monitors political fund raising, said Monday that cable companies 
have doubled their political contributions since the midterm 
elections in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The center said that cable companies in the 1997-1998 election  
cycle gave more than $4.4 million in soft money, political action 
committee contributions and individual contributions to federal 
candidates and parties.

<HEADLINE>  Poll: Americans Approve NATO Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The current strategy of air strikes against  
Serbian targets in the search for peace in Kosovo is supported by a 
majority of Americans, according to a new poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press  
indicated that 60 percent approved of the air strikes by NATO, 
including the United States, and 30 percent disapproved. 
</P>
<P>
	When people were asked whether the North Atlantic Treaty  
Organization has a responsibility to act in Kosovo, 60 percent 
agreed. The United States is a NATO member. 
</P>
<P>
	When NATO is not mentioned, they were about equally divided on  
whether the United States alone has a responsibility to end ethnic 
fighting in Kosovo, a province in Serbia, which is the main 
Yugoslav republic. In a poll taken in 1995, people thought by more 
than a two-to-one margin that the United States had no 
responsibility to intervene in fighting at that time between Serbs 
and Croatians in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	While just over a third now say Kosovo is a very serious problem  
for the United States, about six in 10 consider Iraq a top problem 
for this country. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven in 10 said a very important reason for military action in  
Kosovo is to prevent the killing of innocent people. 
</P>
<P>
	And more than half said they were very worried that U.S. troops  
in Kosovo might suffer casualties, while one in five said they were 
very worried about the financial cost of sending U.S. troops to 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, when asked of plans to send 4,000 U.S. troops as part of a  
peacekeeping force in Kosovo -- part of a settlement between the 
ethnic Albanians of Kosovo and the Serb-led Yugoslav government, 
which has now been put aside -- 49 percent disapproved and 44 
percent approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Public interest in the Kosovo story has almost quadrupled since  
NATO launched a continuing series of airstrikes last week. Four of 
10 say they are following the story closely. More than half in a 
separate question, 57 percent, couldn't name Kosovo as the province 
under fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey of 1,488 adults was taken March 24-28 and  
has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The current strategy of air strikes against  
Serbian targets in the search for peace in Kosovo is supported by a 
majority of Americans, according to a new poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press  
indicated that 60 percent approved of the air strikes by NATO, 
including the United States, and 30 percent disapproved. 
</P>
<P>
	When people were asked whether the North Atlantic Treaty  
Organization has a responsibility to act in Kosovo, 60 percent 
agreed. The United States is a NATO member. 
</P>
<P>
	When NATO is not mentioned, they were about equally divided on  
whether the United States alone has a responsibility to end ethnic 
fighting in Kosovo, a province in Serbia, which is the main 
Yugoslav republic. In a poll taken in 1995, people thought by more 
than a two-to-one margin that the United States had no 
responsibility to intervene in fighting at that time between Serbs 
and Croatians in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	While just over a third now say Kosovo is a very serious problem  
for the United States, about six in 10 consider Iraq a top problem 
for this country. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven in 10 said a very important reason for military action in  
Kosovo is to prevent the killing of innocent people. 
</P>
<P>
	And more than half said they were very worried that U.S. troops  
in Kosovo might suffer casualties, while one in five said they were 
very worried about the financial cost of sending U.S. troops to 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, when asked of plans to send 4,000 U.S. troops as part of a  
peacekeeping force in Kosovo -- part of a settlement between the 
ethnic Albanians of Kosovo and the Serb-led Yugoslav government, 
which has now been put aside -- 49 percent disapproved and 44 
percent approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Public interest in the Kosovo story has almost quadrupled since  
NATO launched a continuing series of airstrikes last week. Four of 
10 say they are following the story closely. More than half in a 
separate question, 57 percent, couldn't name Kosovo as the province 
under fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey of 1,488 adults was taken March 24-28 and  
has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Peter Boyle Released From Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Emmy-winner Peter Boyle, co-star of the CBS  
sitcom ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' was released from the hospital 
a week after suffering a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	An angioplasty was performed at St. Joseph's Hospital in  
Burbank, CBS spokeswoman Janet Kerrigan Daily said Monday. The 
procedure involves inflating a tiny balloon in an artery next to 
the blockage. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyle, 63, who plays Ray Romano's father on the comedy, will  
miss two episodes but may return to work for the season's last pair 
of shows, Ms. Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told our producer he really wants to come back to work,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyle received an Emmy Award in 1996 for a guest appearance on  
``The X-Files.'' His film credits include ``While You Were 
Sleeping,'' ``Young Frankenstein'' and ``Taxi Driver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, he was hospitalized after suffering a mild stroke in  
Salt Lake City.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States plans to give $4 million to  
an international relief fund that assists needy survivors of Nazi 
persecution. 
</P>
<P>
	The contribution will be used to provide food, medicine and  
clothing to Jews in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, 
many of whom were ``double victims'' of Germany and the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to help ensure the survivors ``do not live out their  
remaining years in need,'' James P. Rubin, the State Department 
spokesman, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the United States has pledged $25 million over three  
years. Pledges from about 17 countries total more than $61 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Israel Miller, president of the Conference of Jewish  
Claims Against Germany, praised the State Department's 
announcement. He said the aid was desperately needed.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Are Mixed; Dow Down 32.75 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average retreated from  
10,000 in mixed trading today following a disappointing earnings 
forecast from Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m., the Dow stood at 9,974.03 down 32.75, having regained  
ground after an earlier 132-point loss. The 103-year blue-chip 
index was taking a breather after Monday's session, when it made 
its first close above 10,000, rising 184.54 to 10,006.78. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed today, with the Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index down 1.49 at 1,308.68 and the Nasdaq composite 
index up 12.43 at 2,505.27, primarily on strength in 
computer-related shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was pulled lower by Coca-Cola, which announced late  
Monday that its worldwide soft-drink sales declined in the first 
quarter. Blaming worldwide economic problems, Coke projected a 1 
percent to 2 percent first-quarter decline in case volume, which is 
how the soft drink industry measures shipments. The company usually 
meets annual growth targets of 7 percent to 8 percent. Coke was 
down 1 7/8 today at 62 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, had Coke made its announcement earlier on Monday, it  
would have been enough to prevent the Dow from closing above 
10,000. At 4 p.m. Monday, Coke shares were up 1 7/8 at 67 3/8. After the 
announcement, it gave that gain back in after-hours trading and 
ended the day down 1/2. The total loss Monday of 2 3/8 is the equivalent 
of more than 10 points on the Dow, or enough to have left the 
blue-chip index below 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But computer-related shares were higher today. IBM was up 2 5/8 at  
180 7/16, and AOL was up 13 5/16 at 145 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered  
advancers by a 9-to-8 margin. Volume came to 474.96 million shares, 
down from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board reported today its index of consumer  
confidence rose a stronger-than-expected 0.8 point in March. A 
strong economy and record stock market performance pumped it up for 
a fifth straight month, and the Conference Board said there are no 
signs that consumer confidence will erode any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.94 percent. In  
Europe, markets were mixed after the European Commission cut its 
forecast for economic growth this year by almost a half percentage 
point to 2.2 percent. Germany's DAX index was down 0.41 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.18 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 0.28 percent.

<HEADLINE> Three From New England Head to Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Maine hockey coach Shawn Walsh is looking forward  
to seeing two of his closest rivals at the NCAA hockey 
championships, despite having to fly to California to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about competing against people you respect,'' Walsh said  
of the Black Bears' meeting with Boston College and New Hampshire 
at the Frozen Four. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's tournament marks the first time Hockey East has sent  
three teams to the final four. The last time one conference sent 
three schools was in 1992 when Lake Superior State, Michigan State 
and Michigan went from the Central Collegiate Hockey Association. 
</P>
<P>
	While it is unusual, the New England coaches said they are not  
surprised three teams are making the cross-country trip from New 
England to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we look at the league this past year and see how it's  
going, we're never going to be embarrassed by our 11 losses,'' said 
Boston College coach Jerry York, whose team went 27-11-4. ``I think 
our league this year is very competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston College relied on its Hockey East experience to win two  
differently styled games, a physical 2-1 victory Northern Michigan 
in the first round and then a skillful 3-1 defeat of North Dakota 
in the second round of the West Regionals in Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team was prepared for North Dakota and Northern Michigan  
by playing in our league. In particular, the games with Maine and 
UNH helped our club,'' York said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles, who last won the tournament in 1949, play Maine in  
the semifinals Thursday. Last year, BC lost to Michigan 3-2 in 
overtime in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston College and Maine -- which is making its first appearance  
in the NCAA tournament since the school was put on probation three 
years ago because of NCAA violations -- split their previous four 
meetings this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really going to be the best of five,'' Walsh said. ``We  
have had four games against them, we know about each other and 
we're balanced. California adds a little spice to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Especially for Maine's Steve Kariya, whose older brother, Paul,  
played for Maine and now is the captain for the Anaheim Mighty 
Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you have an older brother who is one of the greatest  
players in the world, you have got to have motivation,'' Walsh 
said. ``I'm sure Steve is picking Paul's brain (about the 
tournament).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve made a name for himself with three goals and three assists  
Saturday to lead the Black Bears past Clarkson 7-2 in the second 
round of the East Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State (29-5-7) and New Hampshire (30-6-3) play in the  
second game Thursday night. The two schools last met in 1982 in a 
first-round series in the tournament. New Hampshire won both games 
and advanced to the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire, which lost 4-0 last year in the semifinals to  
Michigan, is the only team among the four schools to never win the 
national title. 
</P>
<P>
	UNH coach Richard Umile knows a tough conference season prepared  
his team for this tournament, but he doesn't feel like New 
Hampshire is getting a break playing the outsider at the Hockey 
East invitational. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming from top to bottom it has really helped, as a league,  
the type of players we have,'' Umile said. ``It's just good 
competition within the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``But,'' Umile added, ``it's that way nationally.''  
</P>
<P>
	Walsh agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you should get too carried away with it,'' Walsh  
said. ``(Michigan State coach Ron Mason) has always said to me `Our 
league is better.' But really, every league has got some good teams 
and weaker teams.''

<HEADLINE> Survey Lists Best, Worst Umpires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tim McClelland and Jerry Crawford are baseball's  
top umpires, and Ken Kaiser and Charlie Williams are the worst, 
according to a survey by the players' association. 
</P>
<P>
	Players rated umpires on physical condition, physical and mental  
toughness, accuracy of calls on the bases, accuracy of calls at the 
plate, consistency, temperament, respect for players and overall 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	McClelland topped the AL ratings, followed by Jim Joyce, Richie  
Garcia, John Hirschbeck, Mike Reilly and Drew Coble. Kaiser was 
32nd and last, with Durwood Merrill 31st, Ted Hendry 30th, Joe 
Brinkman 29th, Dale Ford 28th and Drew Coble 27th. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford, head of the umpires' union, was tops in the NL,  
followed by Ed Rapuano, Ed Montague, Randy March, Frank Pulli and 
Jeff Kellogg. Charlie Williams was 36th and last, with Eric Gregg 
35th, Joe West 34th, Bruce Froemming 33rd and Harry Wendelstedt 
32nd. 
</P>
<P>
	West and Froemming are among the most confrontational umpires.  
West was last in the NL in both the respect for players and 
temperament categories and Froemming was next to last in both. 
</P>
<P>
	``I give no credence whatsoever to those ratings,'' umpires'  
union head Richie Phillips said. ``I think they're patently absurd. 
I've even been told that some players had their kids fill them 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball officials said they thought players penalized  
confrontational umpires in their ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	``The survey was a players' association initiative, and the  
players are certainly entitled to their opinion,'' NL president Len 
Coleman said. ``I will point out that umpire popularity was a 
factor, and the skills and qualities of many fine umpires were 
distorted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig declined comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``You look at a guy like Bruce Froemming and how many times he's  
assigned by the league president to work big, important games, and 
then you see him rated next to last, what does that mean?'' 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ratings, which were distributed to players, were first  
reported earlier this week by the New York Post, USA Today and the 
Philadelphia Daily News. A copy was obtained by The Associated 
Press on Tuesday from a baseball source on the condition he not be 
identified.

<HEADLINE> Politicians Use Web To Raise Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some presidential candidates hoping to use  
their Internet sites to raise money want to change the rules that 
bar them from using donations made by credit card to qualify for 
federal matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Most campaign Web sites have pages that allow visitors to donate  
to the host candidate, usually by credit card. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Election Commission, which regulates federal  
campaign spending, allows donors to make donations by credit card. 
But for 16 years it has prohibited such donations from counting 
toward a presidential candidate's taxpayer assistance because of 
concerns about fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``A credit card is only a promise of payment, not the actual  
payment,'' said Sharon Snyder of the FEC. ``There's not the 
required documentation like you get with a check.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Watergate, the FEC has provided federal assistance to  
qualified primary candidates -- who can get dollar for dollar 
matching for the first $250 of each private donation they receive 
provided they agree to spending limits. The money comes from the 
checkoff on taxpayers' returns. 
</P>
<P>
	A Republican fund raiser said the FEC's argument that credit  
card transactions are not secure enough is flawed, especially in an 
era when consumers can buy everything from books to cars over the 
Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``So much commerce is done on the Internet and it's considered  
secure, it's considered reliable,'' said Tom Hockaday, a Republican 
political strategist who specializes in fund raising on the Web. 
``It's just as easy and secure as a signature on a check.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Bill Bradley, who is seeking the Democratic  
presidential nomination, last week called for the FEC to change its 
policy. His campaign sent a request asking the six-member 
commission to ``reinterpret'' its regulations and allow credit card 
donations for matching funds in time for the 2000 race. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is clearly a much more significant part of life  
than it has been in previous election cycles,'' said Eric Hauser, 
spokesman for Bradley. ``It's really an opportunity for more people 
to get involved in the matching process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican campaigns also say the FEC policy is flawed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly as the Internet and campaign Web sites play a bigger  
part in the 2000 campaign, and beyond, the rules need to be changed 
to reflect current times,'' said Steve Schmidt, spokesman for Lamar 
Alexander's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Former FEC chairman Trevor Potter went before the commission  
last Wednesday on behalf of America Online to urge them to change 
the rules. They are supporting Bradley's request. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commission has not caught up with technology,'' Potter  
said. The FEC rules date back to 1975, he said, and nothing at all 
has been done about credit cards since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here you have a perfect mechanism for small donors to give,  
and they can't get matching funds'' Potter said, citing the very 
reason why the system of financing campaigns was overhauled in the 
1970s -- to prevent large donors from corrupting the electoral 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	FEC representatives say there is still too much danger of fraud  
to allow matching funds to be given for credit card donations. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision from the Federal Election Commission is required  
within 60 days of Bradley's request.

<HEADLINE> Intel To Build New Chip in N.M. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO RANCHO, N.M. (AP) -- New ``flash-memory'' chips for  
battery-powered devices like cell phones and pagers will be 
produced at Intel Corp.'s plant in Rio Rancho, the company 
announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's C18 chips are supposed to use up to 25 percent less  
energy than current 3-volt products and will allow more battery 
power for cellular talk-time and standby, the company said. The 
flash chips will also function in Global Positioning Satellite 
systems, Intel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big step,'' said Robert Morse, product marketing  
engineer for Intel's Flash Products Division in Folsom, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cellular customers are moving toward lower voltages with fast  
access times,'' said Hans Geyer, vice president and general manager 
of Intel's Flash Products Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume production of the C18, a 1.8-volt advanced boot block  
flash-memory chip will begin in the third quarter of this year at 
Fab 11 in Rio Rancho, the company said. The new chips would be 
smaller than those in present cell phones but would offer longer 
battery life. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel introduced flash-memory chips in 1988. Flash memory allows  
computers, cell phones and pagers to retain information even when 
the power is turned off. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend in flash technology is to store both system  
instructions, or code, and data, such as pictures or voice, in a 
single chip. This enables equipment manufacturers to simplify 
product designs and add security features. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's C18 chips will contain a feature to help protect  
wireless equipment from telecommunications fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association estimated  
that the cell-phone industry lost $182 million in revenue last year 
due to fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	There are different techniques to commit cell-phone fraud, but  
in essence, cell phones can be reprogrammed with counterfeit or 
other users' account codes, which trick the phones into sending the 
bill elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The C18 chip has an unalterable serial number that would be for  
authentication, access rights, equipment registration and other 
security provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to think of it as a key to open a lock into the  
cellular system,'' Morse said. ``No two keys are going to be the 
same.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rally; Fed Leaves Rates Alone / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bonds rose Tuesday as the latest strategy  
meeting by Federal Reserve officials produced no change in central 
bank lending rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 25/32  
point, or $7.81 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, fell to 5.58 percent, down from 5.64 
percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The buying picked up in the afternoon when, as expected, Fed  
officials concluded Tuesday's deliberations without raising 
interest rates to slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent reports have revealed surprising strength in the economy,  
fueling concerns about inflationary pressures. Rising inflation or 
interest rates make fixed-income investments less attractive.

<HEADLINE> Gullikson Confident of Davis Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) -- There's no Pete Sampras or Andre  
Agassi. Still, captain Tom Gullikson insists he has his ``A'' team 
when the United States plays Britain in the Davis Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Martin, Jan-Michael Gambill and Jim Courier are a combined  
13-2 against British stars Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski in 
tournament play. They also are the top three Americans in terms of 
match victories on the ATP Tour this year. 
</P>
<P>
	And even with Britain enjoying the advantage of sellout home  
crowds, Gullikson thinks he won't miss the two biggest U.S. names -- 
Sampras and Agassi -- when the three-day event begins Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly wanted them to play. They're not playing. That's  
their loss as I see it,'' Gullikson said during practice at the 
National Indoor Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not really disappointing. We don't want players here who  
don't want to be here. On the other hand, we've got four terrific 
tennis players who are very, very committed to being on the Davis 
Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	```A' stands for America,'' Gullikson said. ``These guys have  
played everywhere this year and they are the in-form Americans on 
the tour. This is our `A' team definitely. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, Gambill beat Sampras and Agassi on the tour at  
Scottsdale. Todd Martin has worked his way back into the top 10 
this year, winning at Sydney and gaining the quarterfinal of the 
Australian Open and Indian Wells. He's playing excellent tennis. 
Jim Courier made the final at Memphis but was injured in the 
semifinal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin and Courier have played more than a dozen times for the  
United States and clearly have the experience over Henman and 
Rusedski, both highly but playing World Group Davis Cup for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Martin and Courier have both played well in Davis Cup for us  
since I have been captain and this is my sixth year,'' Gullikson 
said. ``They have been very loyal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has also won the 12 Davis Cups matches in  
which Courier has actually played. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Davis Cup and the Grand Slams are the two reasons I get up  
every morning and strap on my shoes to practice,'' the former 
French Open champion said. 
</P>
<P>
	British captain David Lloyd agreed that Sampras' absence didn't  
weaken the American team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pete has not had a great start to the year so it is not a big  
advantage that he is not taking part,'' he said. ``On the other 
hand, Todd Martin's performances this year have been better than 
ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd also dismissed Sampras' lighthearted remark that Rusedski  
shouldn't be on the British team because he was born in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pete's comments are ridiculous and I am surprised that such a  
great player should take it upon himself to make them,'' Lloyd 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I am concerned Greg has got a British passport and  
so he is British. He plays very well for his country and he is very 
patriotic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Also, the United States is a very multinational country. There  
are people from many different nations living there and you don't 
have to look very far back to find links to other countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Britain is back in the top 16 for the first time since 1992 when  
it began a nosedive, sinking to the European Zone Two relegation 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	The British are trying to beat the Americans for the first time  
since 1935, during the Fred Perry era. 
</P>
<P>
	Henman and Rusedski both gained top 10 rankings a month ago. The  
next best player on the British team is Miles Maclaglen, who is 
295th. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is how we perform this weekend,'' Gullikson  
said. ``Past results really favor our team. The results against 
Henman and Rusedski by three of our players possible makes our team 
the favorite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gullikson is not concerned that one of the Davis Cup team's  
biggest critics, John McEnroe, will be doing TV commentary on the 
matches. McEnroe, with a great Davis Cup history, offered himself 
as a doubles player on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's entitled to say what he likes,'' Gullikson said.  
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't really seriously considered at all because he isn't  
playing on the tour or anything. He's 40 years old, he's not on the 
tour and we've got to give the younger players a chance.''

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Plans Online Auctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon.com Inc.'s stock rose sharply today after  
the giant Internet merchant announced plans to launch an auction 
service that will directly compete with leading auction sites eBay 
Inc. and OnSale Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com's move is the Seattle-based company's latest step  
toward building an online retail empire. Last month, it bought a 46 
percent stake in drugstore.com, a new Web site selling 
pharmaceuticals and beauty aids. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last year, it has also added videos, music and some  
gift items to its site, as well as a launched a ``Shop the Web'' 
service that links to other Internet merchants. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon shares were up $11.68 3/4, or more than 8 percent, at  
$150.75 on the Nasdaq stock market today. 
</P>
<P>
	The new auction service will let people buy and sell virtually  
anything at Amazon.com, from cars to special edition Furby dolls. 
Amazon.com hasn't set an exact date for the auction launch, but 
expects it to be available in the next month or so. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can access the auctions from Amazon.com's home page.  
They will be able to search for specific items and submit their 
bids over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike other sites, Amazon.com will offer its shoppers a  
``guarantee'' against fraud by sellers. Amazon.com will reimburse 
customers up to $250 if they can establish that they did not 
receive an item or did not get what they believed they had ordered. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amazon.com guarantee comes amid a sharp rise in consumer  
complaints of online fraud. Last year, two our of every three 
complains were prompted by problems with online auctions, according 
to the Internet Fraud Watch, an online fraud reporting system 
created by the National Consumers League.

<HEADLINE> Reds' Reese Adjusts to Second Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- The first time Pokey Reese went a long way  
to backhand a grounder up the middle and get the runner at first, 
his Cincinnati Reds teammates were impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	When the second baseman-in-training makes a great play nowadays,  
they take it for granted. 
</P>
<P>
	``He makes one of them every day,'' manager Jack McKeon said.  
</P>
<P>
	When spring training opened, Reese was one of the Reds'  
questions. He had been impressive filling in at shortstop and third 
base for the Reds over the past two seasons, but no one was sure 
how quickly he'd adjust to his new position. 
</P>
<P>
	And everyone knew that each mistake would be magnified because  
he was taking over for Bret Boone, a Gold Glove second baseman 
traded to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	With opening day less than a week away, Reese's defense has been  
a highlight rather than a hindrance. He had two more impressive 
plays Tuesday in a 4-2 victory over the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pokey's beautiful, man,'' shortstop Barry Larkin said. ``He's  
a tremendous athlete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reese, 25, came up through the organization touted as their  
shortstop of the future. Most of his playing time in the majors has 
come while filling in when Larkin was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	He seemed to find a niche last season when the Reds moved him to  
third for 24 games and he made one nice play after another. He 
still didn't hit much -- .256 with one homer in 59 games overall -- 
and his season ended on July 30 when he tore a ligament in his 
right thumb while diving for a grounder. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Reds broke up one of the most accomplished double-play  
combinations in the majors by trading Boone, Reese was given the 
biggest challenge of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	At the risk of slighting Boone, McKeon says there's been no  
dropoff defensively. 
</P>
<P>
	``He and Larkin work well together,'' McKeon said. ``Our fans  
are going to see some plays they never saw. Boonie made the big 
plays over to the side (by first base); he makes great plays to the 
other side, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not taking anything away from Boonie. I'm just saying  
Pokey has more range and he's got a good, strong arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reese has committed only two errors this spring -- half as many  
as he had on opening day last year at shortstop. The only unknown 
is how he'll turn double plays once the regular season starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese has had few double-play opportunities this spring. He and  
Larkin practice turning them every day during batting practice, but 
it's not the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pivot at second -- that's probably the biggest thing,''  
Reese said. ``At shortstop, you come right across the bag and see 
the runner in front of you. At second, you see him a little bit but 
you want to concentrate on the ball coming to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While his defense may be good enough to merit comparisons with  
Boone, he probably can't match the offensive numbers that Boone put 
up last season. Boone led the team with 24 homers and 95 RBIs -- 
Hall of Famer Joe Morgan is the only Reds second baseman to surpass 
those totals. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese has hit .228 in parts of two seasons with the Reds and has  
five homers in 530 at-bats. He's hitting .221 with two homers this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon would be content if Reese does what he did last season,  
when he hit .256 with one homer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to depend on what the rest of the club hits,''  
McKeon said. ``If they don't hit, then you're in trouble. Who 
knows? You've got enough hitting around Pokey that you don't worry 
about his hitting. He'll become a better hitter as he gets to 
play.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks fell today as concerns about Japan's  
weak economy overpowered the record close overnight for the Dow 
Jones industrial average. The dollar edged lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.00 yen in late afternoon, down 0.04 yen  
from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its level of 120.13 yen in 
New York overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 149.72 points, or 0.94  
percent, to close at 15,859.12 points. On Monday, the index slipped 
8.15 points, or 0.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei index had risen some 175 points earlier today after  
the Dow gained 184.54 points to close at a record high of 10,006.78 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But selling set in after a pair reports showed Japan's economy  
remains weak. 
</P>
<P>
	The Management and Coordination Agency said Japan's unemployment  
rate surged to a new record high of 4.6 percent in February, up 0.2 
percentage point from the previous record in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the agency said spending by Japanese workers fell  
4.1 percent in February from the same month last year, the largest 
year on year drop in 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say consumption continues to suffer in Japan as workers  
face ongoing job uncertainty. Many Japanese companies are 
accelerating the pace of restructuring, slashing wages and 
encouraging workers to retire early. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the moment, foreign investors have stopped their buying and  
domestic investors are selling ahead of book closings,'' said 
Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities. The 
accounting year for Japanese companies closes Wednesday with the 
end of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 464  
million shares, up from Monday's turnover of 379 million shares. 
Declines outnumbered advances 760 to 452, with 99 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 0.57 points, or 0.04 percent, to 1,269.24. The 
TOPIX gained 0.89 points, or 0.07 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved as high as 120.69 yen  
early in the session as U.S. investors covered, short, or oversold 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders said the dollar buying binge quickly ran out of  
steam, prompting selling by speculators who had hoped for the rally 
to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no major market moving news in today's trading in  
Tokyo. The dollar traded in a range between 119.85 yen and 120.69 
yen 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 128.88 yen, up from  
128.78 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.735 percent from Monday's finish of 1.820 percent, 
driving its price up to 100.56 yen from 99.82 yen.

<HEADLINE> Photojournalist Aigner Dead at 97 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREAT BARRINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- Photojournalist Lucien Aigner,  
known for his images of Einstein in front of a blackboard and 
Mussolini tweaking his nose, has died. He was 97. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hungarian-born Aigner, brother of the noted designer Etienne  
Aigner, died Monday in a Waltham nursing home. The cause of death 
was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	He was among the first photojournalists to exploit the ability  
of a small 35 mm camera to capture candid images of prewar Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	His image of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was taken at a  
1935 conference where England and France tried to dissuade 
Mussolini from an alliance with Hitler. He was able to take it only 
because his camera was inconspicuous. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1995 Associated Press interview, he said no one at first  
wanted the unflattering shot of Mussolini's ``nervous gesture,'' 
but after war engulfed Europe it was eventually run on the cover of 
Newsweek in 1941 with the caption ``Il Duce Defies Democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aigner had fled Paris in 1938, when the war was looming. His  
photo of a rumpled Albert Einstein in droopy trousers standing 
before a blackboard was taken in a Princeton classroom in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	``Einstein liked it. He thought that was the best picture ever  
taken of him,'' Aigner said. He recalled Einstein sent him a silly 
jingle in German about the ease with which ``you can lose your 
pants when with science you are busy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he had no favorites among his thousands of images.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is a bad thing for a father to have favorites,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Among his other notable photo topics were a French sailor and  
his girl dancing in the street on Bastille Day, a smirking Hitler 
and New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was a writer, radio announcer, script writer and  
producer for the Voice of America before coming to this small 
village in the Berkshires in 1954 to open a portrait studio. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his brother, survivors include two sons, two  
daughters and a sister.

<HEADLINE> Taiwanese Executives To Stand Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- For years, executives at adhesive makers Avery  
Dennison Corp. and Four Pillars Enterprise Co. Ltd. of Taiwan 
appeared to be friendly rivals, exchanging letters and even 
discussing a possible joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors say that behind the scenes, trade secrets were  
being stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	Pin Yen Yang, 72, president of Four Pillars, and his 40-year-old  
daughter, Hwei Chen ``Sally'' Yang, were to appear in U.S. District 
Court today in Youngstown for their alleged roles in stealing trade 
secrets from Avery Dennison. 
</P>
<P>
	Both have pleaded innocent to charges of economic espionage,  
conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering and receipt of 
stolen goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI says the Yangs paid about $150,000 to Ten Hong Lee, also  
known as Victor Lee, a research engineer at an Avery Dennison lab 
about 20 miles east of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Lee slipped them trade secrets related to products  
such as self-stick postage stamps, name labels, diaper tape and 
battery labels from 1989 to 1997, the FBI said when the Yangs were 
indicted in Cleveland in September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee pleaded guilty to wire fraud and is expected to testify  
against the Yangs. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Pillars says its executives have done nothing criminal.  
</P>
<P>
	``The case is a business dispute in which the government has  
decided to take sides,'' said Patricia Smith, a Four Pillars 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies have each filed lawsuits against each other. Avery  
Dennison has sued Four Pillars in U.S. District Court in Ohio for 
unspecified damages in a suit that essentially repeats the 
allegations made in the criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Pillars has sued Avery Dennison in China and Taiwan for  
$262 million worth of trade secrets it says Avery Dennison stole 
while the companies discussed a possible joint venture in the late 
1980s and early 1990s.

<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Tom Crean, an assistant coach at Michigan  
State, will be introduced as Marquette's new head coach Tuesday,

<HEADLINE> For One Night on the Floor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- He was the trump card no one  
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't come here to prove anything,'' Jim Calhoun said. ``I  
came here to coach my teams as well as I could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One day earlier, when Calhoun called Duke's Mike Krzyzewski the  
best coach of his generation, knowing glances were exchanged all 
around. But just this once, Krzyzewski wasn't even the best coach 
on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	On the biggest night of his life, that distinction belonged to  
Calhoun. And when his Connecticut Huskies beat the team everyone 
said couldn't be beat with a national title on the line, the first 
people Calhoun thanked were the kids who bought him time to 
complete his coaching education. 
</P>
<P>
	Cliff Robinson. Donyell Marshall. Ray Allen -- the names rolled  
off his tongue as fast as the beads of sweat slid from his brow. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every one of our kids,'' he paused, ``had an awful lot to do  
with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But none moreso than the 56-year-old Calhoun. Rather than leave  
his native New England, he made the short hop from Boston down to 
Storrs, Conn., in 1986, determined to build a national power from 
scratch. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Calhoun recalled how, in his first few years on the  
job in Connecticut, he was not above pitching recruits on the 
chance they'd get their heads handed to them by the best players in 
the best arenas in the best conference in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would tell kids, `Would you like to play against Reggie  
Williams and Alonzo Mourning? Would you like to play in the Carrier 
Dome -- just not for Syracuse?' 
</P>
<P>
	``And if a kid said I love Georgetown an awful lot,'' Calhoun  
said, ``I'd ask, `Have you talked to Coach Thompson? No? Good.' And 
we went from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After seven failed attempts to get past the round of eight in  
the NCAA tournament, he finally landed in the championship game, 
carried there by kids who came to Connecticut precisely because 
Calhoun had turned the Huskies into the beasts of the Big East. 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed to be his bad luck to arrive the same year that  
Krzyzewski did -- with what was considered a team for the ages. But 
Calhoun turned even that to his advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you hear it all season long that they can't be beat, it  
motivates you,'' Rashamel Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the coach knew better than his kids that inspiration  
without serious preparation would only carry them so far against 
the Blue Devils. And so when he gathered his team together Sunday 
night, he pulled the Duke file from a handful he began keeping on 
the top teams in the country and updated as the season rolled 
along. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told our team, `This is the first team you'll face all year  
that's as good as you. But here's what they can't do,''' Calhoun 
said, producing his notes. ``And that's how we're going to beat 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, elegant for its simplicity, contained three main  
points: pressure Duke's backcourt and force Trajan Langdon to bring 
the ball up the court instead of William Avery, who is the better 
ballhandler and penetrator; double-team Duke's big man, Elton 
Brand, with big men of their own; and shuttle as many of his own 
guys in and out of the game as possible to keep everybody fresh. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were deeper offensively,'' Calhoun said, ``but I thought  
we were deeper defensively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers backed him up. The Blue Devils' 41 percent  
field-goal shooting tied their lowest performance this season. In 
the last 14 games, Duke outrebounded opponents by an average margin 
of 12; on this night, Connecticut grabbed 10 more rebounds, winning 
the battle of the boards 41-31. The Huskies' reserves outscored 
Duke's 17-8. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, they added to up to the national championship Calhoun  
wondered if he'd ever get. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't validate me by any stretch of the imagination,'' he  
said, ``it honors me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final honor was bestowed by Krzyzewski when the two coaches  
met briefly in a hallway. They shook hands, exchanged a few words 
and hugged each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim, you've got a great team and it was a great game,''  
Krzyzewski said. ``I'm so proud. I know you are, too. I'm so proud 
of the way you played us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a short moment at the end of a long, draining month.  
Calhoun lost a young friend he treated like a son -- former 
Connecticut equipment manager Joe McGinn, who died of kidney 
disease at age 26 -- and gained a granddaughter whose picture he 
carried in the breast pocket of his jacket for the entire ride. 
</P>
<P>
	Those two events taught him more about winning and losing than  
three decades on the sideline ever could. And so when he climbed a 
ladder on the floor of Tropicana Field to cut down the net, Calhoun 
took great pains to leave one strand dangling. 
</P>
<P>
	``That,'' he said, with tears at the corners of his eyes, ``was  
for Joe.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> It's Official: Benson on Pirates Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- Kris Benson was told when spring training  
began that he had almost no chance to make the Pittsburgh Pirates' 
pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, it probably wouldn't have bothered him. This year,  
it made him angry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to have a laid-back attitude and waited for things to  
happen,'' said Benson, the No. 1 pick in the 1996 amateur draft. 
``This year, I know I'm ready. I've changed my whole attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also will change addresses.  
</P>
<P>
	After limiting Toronto to one run in six innings Tuesday, Benson  
was told by manager Gene Lamont that he had officially made the 
staff. He will make his major league debut April 9 against the 
Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson has been the Pirates' most effective starter this spring,  
allowing two earned runs, striking out 14 and walking two in 24 
innings. His 0.75 ERA is among the lowest of all major league 
starters. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league starter? Those words sound pretty good to Benson,  
who struggled in Triple-A with an 8-10 record and 5.37 ERA last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard the news I wanted to hear, and now I finally know,''  
said Benson, who was told as late as last week he probably wouldn't 
make the staff. ``It's a big relief and I will sleep a lot easier 
tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just his personality that has changed with the former  
Clemson pitching star, but also his approach. He is throwing his 
fastball consistently for strikes, and has added a slider as an 
effective fourth pitch to go with his fastball, curve and changeup. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson was one of the best college pitchers ever, going 14-0  
with a 1.40 ERA during his senior season at Clemson in 1996. After 
pitching in the Olympics, the Pirates gave him a $2 million signing 
bonus, but he was only 16-17 with a 4.69 ERA in the minors the last 
two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something really clicked with him over the winter,'' Lamont  
said. ``He's just a different pitcher. You can't turn your back to 
what he's done. You don't want to be hardheaded and ignore what 
he's done because, while it's not the same (as the season), there 
is pressure every time you pitch in spring training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benson will begin the season in the rotation with right-handers  
Francisco Cordova, Jason Schmidt and left-hander Pete Schourek. 
Left-hander Chris Peters, previously expected to be the No. 4 
starter, goes into the bullpen but may rejoin the rotation once the 
Pirates need a fifth starter April 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``That will be fine,'' Peters said. ``I'd like to start the  
whole year, but if it is best for the team pitching out of the 
bullpen, I'll deal with it the best I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right-hander Jose Silva, initially projected as the No. 5  
starter, is on the disabled list with facial injuries caused when 
he was struck by a batted ball last week. Lamont said his return 
isn't imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	Silva pitched effectively early last season, winning six of his  
first nine decisions before sitting out three months with a broken 
arm. The Pirates rushed him back in September to get him four more 
starts, but he pitched poorly in each one. 
</P>
<P>
	``He needs to come back and throw well,'' Lamont said. ``Last  
year when he came back, he wasn't ready to pitch. If he's going to 
be in the rotation, he's got to get people out. It's probably going 
to be a while for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To ease the pressure on Benson, Lamont assured him the promotion  
isn't an audition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like he's going to get two starts and then will go  
back to the minor leagues,'' Lamont said. ``That's not the plan. 
We'll give him at least 5-6 starts to see if he is ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody is expecting Benson to be as dominating as he has been  
this spring, but first baseman Kevin Young is impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been here three years and let's hope this is his time,''  
Young said. ``You like to play behind him because he works fast, 
fields his position well and throw strikes.''

<HEADLINE> High Court To Mull States' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Supreme Court increasingly sensitive to how  
individual states' authority fares when pitted against the federal 
government's power is studying an overtime-pay dispute from Maine 
that could yield a key states-rights ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	After hearing arguments today, the justices must decide by late  
June whether state governments can be sued in state courts by 
employees seeking to enforce a federal labor law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Surprisingly, in over two centuries of Supreme Court  
precedent, the issue has never been squarely presented and resolved 
-- until now,'' said Douglas Kmiec, a Pepperdine University law 
professor who studied the Maine case. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of state-employed probation officers sued Maine in  
federal court in 1992, saying they were unfairly being denied the 
time-and-one-half pay guaranteed by the federal Fair Labor 
Standards Act for work over 40 hours per week. 
</P>
<P>
	While their lawsuit was pending, the Supreme Court ruled in 1996  
that the Constitution's 11th Amendment shields states from being 
sued against their will in federal court. So the probation officers 
refiled their lawsuit in state court, still depending on the 
federal labor law. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine's courts, however, ruled that the 11th Amendment makes  
states immune from state court lawsuits that would be barred in 
federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling would make the state totally immune from being sued  
by employees who allege labor-law violations, although federal 
labor officials still could sue the state to enforce the law. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Supreme Court, the probation officers picked up a  
powerful ally -- the Clinton administration. The court allowed 
Solicitor General Seth Waxman, the Justice Department's top 
courtroom lawyer, to argue against giving Maine such state court 
immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute also attracted considerable unsolicited advice for  
the justices. 
</P>
<P>
	In friends-of-the-court briefs, the probation officers' Supreme  
Court appeal is supported by the National Association of Police 
Organizations and a coalition of publishers worried about their 
right to sue states over alleged copyright infringement. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those supporting Maine in such briefs are 37 other states,  
the National League of Cities, National Association of Counties and 
National Governors' Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The court stunned Congress in 1995 when it struck down a federal  
law making it a crime to possess a gun near a school. The court 
said Congress had exceeded its power to regulate interstate 
commerce and impinged on state power when it enacted the law. 
</P>
<P>
	After its 1996 ruling limiting Congress' power to makes states  
vulnerable to being sued in federal court, the court invoked state 
sovereignty when in 1997 it struck down part of the federal Brady 
gun-control law. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also has agreed to decide three other states-rights  
issues within the next year: 
</P>
<P>
	--Can states be sued for patent infringement?  
</P>
<P>
	--Can they be sued for violating a federal false-advertising law?  
</P>
<P>
	--Can state employees sue over alleged violations of the federal  
law banning on-the-job age bias?

<HEADLINE> Nuggets, Avalanche May Be Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A subsidiary of Ascent Entertainment Group  
reportedly has reached a tentative agreement to sell the Denver 
Nuggets, the Colorado Avalanche and the Pepsi Center to a group 
headed by a former college basketball player, Bill Laurie, The 
Denver Post reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Ascent Sports' teams and the $170 million arena, which is under  
construction, are worth at least $400 million, the newspaper 
reported, quoting unidentified NBA sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Lyons, Ascent's chief executive officer, declined  
comment through a spokesman. Laurie, whose wife is an heir to the 
Wal-Mart Corp. fortune, also declined comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation about the possible sale of the two teams has been  
rumored for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, KMGH-TV said Ascent executives were discussing a  
possible sale with Wal-Mart officials. Lyons called that report 
inaccurate and Wal-Mart executives denied corporate involvement in 
any talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie met Nancy Walton while the two attended high school in  
Versailles, Mo. He was a guard at Memphis State and then coached 
high school basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Walton's late father, James ``Bud'' Walton, and his brother,  
Sam, co-founded the Wal-Mart chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Ascent's foray into professional sports began in the early 1990s  
when, as COMSAT Video Enterprises, it spent $17 million for a 
majority interest in the NBA's Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, it paid $65 million for the Avalanche of the NHL.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mixed Against Top Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar was mixed against major currencies as  
inaction from the Federal Reserve on interest rates left the market 
directionless. 
</P>
<P>
	Many currency traders waited on the sidelines ahead of the  
afternoon announcement from the Fed following the meeting of its 
policy-setting committee. As expected, the Fed left interest rates 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0715, down  
slightly from $1.0735 late Monday. The dollar inched higher against 
the Japanese yen, settling at 120.36 yen, up from 120.13 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4899 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4848, and 1.5117 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5139. The British 
pound fell to $1.6108 from $1.6168. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8255 German 
marks, up from 1.8218; 6.1237 French francs, up from 6.1087; and 
1,808.32 Italian lire, up from 1,798.56.

<HEADLINE> Indians' Thome Cites Unusual Spring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (AP) -- As his teammates take batting  
practice, Jim Thome sits in the Indians' dugout with a cool drink, 
soaking it all in. 
</P>
<P>
	Thome has already taken his turn in the cage, and he didn't  
disappoint the fans who arrived early to see the Indians hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Thome, who hit 30 homers last year despite missing 35 games with  
a broken hand, launched several missiles over the right-field wall 
at Chain O' Lakes Park, endangering the inhabitants and windows of 
some nearby condos. 
</P>
<P>
	Thome has been coming to spring training with the Indians since  
1990, and as this camp heads into its final days, he says this has 
been the most unusual one of his baseball career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not exactly sure what it is,'' he said. ``It's kind of  
hard to explain, but this spring training has been very different 
from the others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Different how, Jim? Nicer weather? Better buffet spread?  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's in how we're getting our work done,'' he said.  
``Guys are working hard, but they're going about it differently. In 
the past, a guy might take 100 grounders or extra BP. Now, he might 
take just 25 grounders, but they're 25 quality ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't get Thome wrong. The Indians have been sweating in the  
Florida sunshine. It's not unusual to see several of the team's 
star players like Roberto and Sandy Alomar, Thome and Travis Fryman 
taking postgame batting practice with hitting coach Charlie Manuel. 
</P>
<P>
	What Thome has seen, though, is a renewed focus with this year's  
Tribe. The cockiness that characterized some of the Cleveland teams 
in the past has been replaced by a quieter confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of experience on this team,'' he said. ``This  
is a team full of players who have been in big games and know what 
it takes to get the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None more than Thome, who before having his hand broken by a  
pitch from Tampa Bay's Wilson Alvarez last August, was ranked in 
the Top 10 in nine different offensive categories and on pace to 
set career-highs in homers and RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite hitting a home run in his first at-bat after being  
activated, Thome, like the Indians, finished the regular season in 
a crawl. He hit just .195 in his last 12 games and went 1-for-13 
ending the year. 
</P>
<P>
	But his power stroke returned in the postseason, and Thome hit  
six homers in the playoffs, including a record four in the AL 
championship series against the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	On a roster which this year boasts an All-Star at every  
position, Thome is one of the Indians' leaders -- on and off the 
field. It's a role the 28-year-old Thome takes seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``You may try to be a leader, but you'll never just wake up and  
be one. I try to be a leader not vocally, but by performing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Thome was injured last season, the Indians brought up  
Richie Sexson to play first. Thome took the youngster under his 
wing and now the two are close friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want young kids to feel comfortable,'' Thome said.  
``That's how Brook Jacoby and Eddie Murray treated me when I was 
coming up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, after the Indians came within two outs of winning the  
World Series in 1997, Thome came to training camp with T-shirts for 
his teammates. ``Team Thome 25'' they said on the front, with ``It 
Don't Mean A Thing 'Till We Win The Ring'' on the back. 
</P>
<P>
	While the shirts are still around, the Indians are still without  
a World Series ring. And this year they've added a new shirt to 
their wardrobes. This one says: ``100+ Go Hard or Go Home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove has asked his team to win 100  
regular-season games this year on the way to winning a World Series 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	Thome thinks the idea of a motivational tool is a good one,  
helping to set the tone for a season he hope ends with a win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's good,'' Thome said. ``It should help us stay  
focused on the ultimate prize. All that matters this year is 
winning that last game we play.''

<HEADLINE> Baldwin To Start for White Sox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The decision on an opening day starter for  
the Chicago White Sox turned out not to so tough. 
</P>
<P>
	James Baldwin, whose 10-3 record in the second half last season  
was one of the best in the majors, will start opening day in part 
because left-hander Mike Sirotka is experiencing a ``dead arm,'' 
manager Jerry Manuel said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means a lot,'' Baldwin said. ``Every starter that comes to  
the big leagues wants to be an opening day starter. I had to work 
hard to get to that position and that point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sirotka was scratched from Wednesday's exhibition home finale.  
He'll start the second game of the season if his arm is better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike looks like his arm is a little tired, a little fatigued,  
so we'd rather be cautious,'' Manuel said before the White Sox beat 
Colorado 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Sirotka, who led the White Sox in victories last season with 14,  
had a better spring than Baldwin, going 3-0 with a 3.18 ERA. 
Baldwin improved his record to 2-1 with Tuesday night's victory 
over Colorado -- he gave up seven hits in six scoreless innings -- 
and his ERA dropped to 4.15. 
</P>
<P>
	But the White Sox don't want to take any chances with Sirotka.  
There have already been enough serious injuries to pitchers this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be real, real careful,'' Manuel said. ``We don't  
want to push him at all or rush him.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* John Cangelosi, whose 79 pinch hits are fourth-highest  
among active players, was released Tuesday. Infielder Carlos Lee 
was optioned to Triple A, and catcher Josh Paul was optioned to the 
minor leagues. Infielder Gabby Martinez was reassigned to minor 
league camp and Darren Hall was put on the disabled list.

<HEADLINE> Fed Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve policy-makers opted to keep  
interest rates unchanged Tuesday as they sought to steer the 
economy past such widely divergent threats as a possibly overly 
exuberant stock market at home and war in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank's monetary policy panel -- the Federal Open  
Market Committee -- ended a closed-door meeting by signaling it had 
left the benchmark rate on overnight loans between banks at 4.75 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been at that level, a four-year low, since Nov. 17, 1998,  
when the Fed finished reducing it -- in three steps over seven weeks 
-- from 5.5 percent to insulate the U.S. economy from the 
aftershocks of last summer's collapse of the Russian ruble. 
</P>
<P>
	In an announcement noting their meeting had ended after three  
and a half hours, Fed policy-makers made no mention of a change in 
their thinking about the likely direction of future interest-rate 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, they decided to sometimes announce shifts in their  
so-called policy bias. It's been neutral since November, meaning 
panel members believe there's an equal chance of a decrease or 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists had widely anticipated both no change in rates and no  
change in the bias, so financial markets showed little reaction. On 
Monday, traders drove the Dow Jones industrial average to its first 
close above 10,000. It retreated 94 points Tuesday, closing at 
9,913. 
</P>
<P>
	With economic growth strong and the stock prices high in the  
United States, the Federal Reserve has no need to cut interest 
rates again. But with consumer prices advancing at a benign 1.6 
percent annual rate so far this year, a rate increase to dampen 
demand isn't needed either.

<P>
	``We expect that to be its stance for the indefinite future,''  
said economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch in New York. ``U.S. 
growth remains robust, but inflation remains nonexistent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists believe the beginnings of a recovery in Asia  
eventually will increase world demand enough to push commodity 
prices higher. That, combined with a partial rebound in oil prices, 
could draw an inflation-dampening interest-rate increase from the 
Fed later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Carl Tannenbaum of LaSalle National Bank in Chicago  
said, however, the war in the Balkans argues against a potentially 
destabilizing rate cut. If the war escalates, it could hurt U.S. 
consumer confidence, which moved higher in March for the fifth 
consecutive month, according to the Conference Board, a New 
York-based research organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you begin to get worried, whether it's justified or not,  
and your economic behavior reflects that, then all of a sudden the 
magic carpet ride stops,'' he said. ``Remember, the thing that 
started the 1990 recession was the Gulf War.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Year 2000 computer problems pose another threat to economic  
growth, said economist Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National 
Association of Manufacturers.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Sponsors Seek Concessions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Some of the Olympics' top sponsors want  
``concessions for damage'' to their $50 million investments by the 
Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity,  
were among some 40 representatives of the 11 biggest corporate 
backers of the games who met Tuesday with the marketing leaders of 
the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day when IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch turned down a  
Senate invitation to testify about the scandal and plans to prevent 
a recurrence, sponsors said concern remained in corporate suites 
about the bribery case and its aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsor representatives also said IOC vice president Richard  
Pound and marketing director Michael Payne were asked for the first 
time how the IOC might make ``concessions for the damage'' to their 
sponsor commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was total bottom line,'' one official said. ``They were  
told, `We are having problems getting Olympic budgets and programs 
through because you haven't given us enough ammunition to prove it 
(the scandal) is fixed. So how are you going to make it up to 
us?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsors are not seeking rebates, but instead want ``items  
of marketing value,'' such as increased access to street ad space 
around the 2000 Games in Sydney, another representative said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsor officials all said there was no direct response from  
Pound or Payne. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said the sponsors are concerned that ``the events of the  
last three months had slowed down the internal allocation of 
resources, a `Why don't we wait and see what's happening before 
doing X or Y for Sydney or Salt Lake?' 
</P>
<P>
	``They've probably lost 3-4 months on that, but there's still  
plenty of time to do things. I believe if they report in their 
internal process that these things are happening, that goes away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No ringing endorsement was issued by the sponsors in the first  
meeting since an emergency IOC assembly expelled six delegates and 
set the framework for what the committee hopes will be watershed 
reforms to its structure and membership. 
</P>
<P>
	But there also was no repeat of the sharp criticism of the last  
meeting with sponsors in mid-February, when boardroom concerns over 
the scandal's impact on the ``halo effect'' of Olympic sponsorship 
were repeated loud and clear. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a much better meeting,'' Pound said. ``It didn't have  
the sense of discomfort, unease and suspicion. ... My impression is 
that they feel we do have a blueprint that looks sensible. We now 
have to build according to that plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch told the Senate Commerce Committee that he would be  
unable to attend hearings April 14 on the Salt Lake City bribery 
case. He gave no reason for declining the invitation and said he 
hopes Anita DeFrantz, an IOC vice president from Los Angeles, would 
be allowed to take his place. 
</P>
<P>
	``We share your concern on the need of reform for the  
International Olympic Committee and want to assure you that we are 
deeply committed to restoring the integrity of the Olympic 
ideals,'' he said in a letter to Sen. John McCain, the Commerce 
Committee chairman. ``The IOC has taken serious action to deal with 
the past and intends to continue to work with a number of people, 
including yourself, to set the IOC on the right course for the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But McCain, critical of Samaranch and the IOC since the scandal  
broke late last year, said he was ``deeply saddened'' that the top 
leader of the Olympics passed up a chance to explain ``the reform 
and ethics initiatives of the organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently, Mr. Samaranch doesn't understand the gravity of  
the situation for the future of the Olympic movement,'' McCain said 
from his Washington office. ``The lack of transparency and 
accountability within the IOC, that fostered a culture based on 
gifts and lavish travel, has brought a dark cloud over the 
integrity of the Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation is pending that would hit the IOC squarely in its  
bank account, stripping tax breaks from the panel and its 
sponsorship deals and rerouting billions of television dollars to 
the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, an Arizona Republican with presidential aspirations,  
said his committee ``must now move forward, unfortunately without 
Mr. Samaranch's direct input, to ensure that urgently needed 
reforms are implemented.''

	The Pacific Northwest and Deep South were hit by mostly light  
rain Tuesday, while most of the rest of the nation enjoyed pleasant 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	A storm system pushing into the Pacific Northwest dumped rain  
and mountain snow east into Montana and Idaho. Most of the snow was 
light, although up to 6 inches of snow was expected in the Cascades 
and Rockies. Light rain was falling at lower levels and as far 
south as northern Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	A slow-moving system brought scattered showers and some  
thunderstorms along the Gulf Coast from eastern Texas into areas of 
Georgia. Rainfall amounts were heaviest across southern 
Mississippi, southern Alabama and far western Florida Panhandle, 
with up to a half-inch of rain expected. 
</P>
<P>
	A large chunk of the East enjoyed fair skies and pleasant  
weather, with only a few light showers in New England. 
</P>
<P>
	Mostly fair weather also continued across a good part of the

<HEADLINE> Companies Reap 'Melissa' Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Antivirus software companies will reap  
big benefits from the insidious Melissa computer bug that is 
roaming across the virtual world, mutating as it goes, analysts 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A major outbreak of any virus, especially when it receives  
extensive coverage like Melissa, is going to be good for the 
antivirus business,'' said International Data Corp. researcher 
Chris Christiansen. 
</P>
<P>
	The new computer virus spread quickly across the Internet over  
the weekend, paralyzing corporate e-mail systems by getting into 
users' e-mail address books and sending infected messages to 
everyone in them. 
</P>
<P>
	By Tuesday, several variations were popping up in personal  
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly this gets most businesses out of the complacency  
they may have fallen into with regards to any virus and raises 
public awareness of the need for antivirus software,'' said Kevin 
Hause, another IDC analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	Antivirus software -- known in the industry as a ``vaccine'' --  
detects the presence of a computer virus in a system by checking 
for unusual attempts to access disk areas and system files. It also 
searches for specific viruses. Most computers used in businesses 
and homes are equipped with the software. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Melissa is a new virus, it slipped past installed  
antivirus software. Developers had to rush to update their products 
and get them out to the public once the virus became known. 
</P>
<P>
	Antivirus software sales reached $1.3 billion last year,  
according to IDC, up from $915 million in 1997 and $430 million in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	An antivirus system for a personal computer typically costs  
around $50. Corporate systems can cost about $15 per machine, 
amounting to thousands of dollars for companies with lots of 
computers. Updates generally cost about $3 per seat, although most 
Melissa patches are being offered for free. 
</P>
<P>
	Gartner Group research analyst Arabella Hallawell said a virus  
like Melissa pushes technical advances at the antivirus companies 
as well as spurring sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``The onus is on the vendors now to figure out ways to react  
quickly to viruses like Melissa -- alert customers and update and 
distribute the fix,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The top antivirus vendors -- Network Associates Inc. of Santa  
Clara, Calif., and Symantec of Cupertino, Calif. -- reacted swiftly 
to the Melissa virus, setting up emergency response teams, tracking 
the origins in their laboratories and monitoring the mutations. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies were also pitching dozens of antivirus software  
systems with reassuring names like Guard Dog, VirusScan, ViruSafe, 
Sweep, eSafe Protect, and PC-cillin, using the Internet to tie the 
products into news about Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
	``When there's a high-profile virus outbreak, it's really  
another chance for us to inform people that they need to be careful 
and that antivirus software is insurance,'' said Steve Trilling, 
Symantec's antivirus research director. ``You need to pay to 
protect your data.''

<HEADLINE> EU Cuts Economic Growth Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Commission on Tuesday  
reduced its forecast for economic growth in the 11-nation euro-zone 
this year by almost a half percentage point to 2.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The less-optimistic prediction was part of the twice-yearly  
economic report by the European Union's executive body. The last 
forecast, published in October, predicted growth of 2.6 percent 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The sign of slower growth in the 11 nations that adopted the  
euro as their shared currency on Jan. 1, will add to speculation 
the European Central Bank will cut interest rates in the euro-zone 
to boost the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission expects growth to rise to 2.7 percent in 2000.  
</P>
<P>
	It said growth in the 15-nation EU as a whole was expected to be  
2.1 percent in 1999 and 2.7 percent next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union Commission economic forecasts released  
Tuesday include the following estimates for growth and unemployment

1998.

<HEADLINE> Hamilton Leads UConn to NCAA Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Richard Hamilton thought the 27  
points he scored in leading Connecticut to its first national 
championship were no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
	See the basket. Shoot the ball. Score the points.  
</P>
<P>
	He makes it sound so simple.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it was hard,'' Hamilton said in his low-key  
style. ``I've been doing the same thing all year. Give credit to my 
teammates. They set extra screens for me. They just get the ball to 
me when I'm open and I hit the shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``The same thing has been going on all year. I got open  
opportunities and I just took advantage of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's nothing complicated about any of that, if you believe  
Hamilton. There's something more involved, though, according to 
coach Jim Calhoun. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing is, he's a great basketball player,'' he said.  
``Great scorers score so many different ways and can beat you so 
many different ways. He has a tremendous mind for the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It added up to an All-American season for Hamilton. He also  
shared the Big East Conference Player of the Year award, joining 
Patrick Ewing and Chris Mullin as the only players to win that 
award twice. And when he went over the 2,000-point mark in 
Saturday's semifinal victory over Ohio State, it made him the 
second highest scorer in UConn history. 
</P>
<P>
	All very nice, but Hamilton was really after a national  
championship. To do it, the Huskies would have to beat a Duke team 
that had lost just once all season and won 32 games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt we had a chance,'' Hamilton said. ``If we came in and  
played our game, we had a good chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew we had to attack. We didn't want to be jumper happy.  
If we got to the paint, we wanted to take advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and the Huskies did that in the 77-74 victory.  
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun knows what a special player Hamilton has become.  
</P>
<P>
	``He scored 27 tonight,'' the coach said. ``Sometimes he puts up  
30 and I'll ask him if his mom and dad were keeping score.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No need for that. Hamilton had all the help he needed from his  
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played with a lot of heart,'' he said. ``Everybody's got  
the mentality of refuse to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton struggled a bit with his shot in the first half, making  
five of 13 attempts. But was 5-for-9 in the final 20 minutes, 
including a pair of 3-pointers. The second one was perhaps his most 
impressive shot of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	With 3:50 to play and the score tied at 68, Hamilton took a shot  
to the midsection from Chris Carrawell and was doubled over, trying 
to catch his breath. After a moment, he walked to the foul line and 
hit both free throws for a 70-68 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, 12 seconds later, Connecticut got the ball back and  
Hamilton's 23-foot shot gave the Huskies a five-point lead. Duke 
never quite recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	As time ran out Monday night, Hamilton reflected on what had  
happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really can't describe that feeling,'' he said. ``I still  
don't understand what we did. I'm just happy to put a smile on 
coach's face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did the same thing last spring when he decided to stay at  
Connecticut for his junior year instead of leaving for the NBA. At 
the time, he thought Calhoun was using some of old fashioned Irish 
blarney to convince him to stick around. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad I stayed for my junior year,'' he said. ``He told me,  
`Rip, you've got a chance to win a national championship.' I really 
didn't believe him. Now that we've won it, I'm very appreciative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is Calhoun.

<HEADLINE> Josh Davis Wins 200-Meter Freestyle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST MEADOW, N.Y. (AP) -- Josh Davis, triple gold medalist in the  
Atlanta Olympics, earned his seventh career U.S. national title 
Tuesday night by edging Ugur Taner in the 200-meter freestyle. in 
the National Swimming Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, 26, of Texas Aquatics, was timed in 1 minute, 49.45  
seconds, .03 faster than Taner, who beat Davis in last year's 
national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who recently became a father for the second time, is a  
part-time swimmer, part-time house-husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go to work for two hours in the morning from 6 to 8 and then  
I go to work in the afternoon from 2-5 p.m., so other than that I'm 
at home with my kids, which is very special,'' he said. ``I'm very, 
very blessed that I get to spend so much time with my family and 
that's why, one of the main reasons, I'll keep swimming as long as 
I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Wilkens won his second title in two days with the  
fourth-fastest American time in the 400-meter individual medley. 
Wilkens, 23, of Middletown, N.J., was timed in 4:17.12, a time 
bettered only by Tom Dolan, Eric Namesnik and Dave Wharton. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkens, who won the 200-meter breaststroke Monday night, grew  
up less than two hours away in New Jersey. About 20 relatives and a 
lot of friends watched him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely an incentive and it's exciting,'' Wilkens  
said. ``Some of my relatives have never seen me swim live; they 
usually get the videotape version. My grandparents are proud of me; 
they don't really understand swimming sometimes. It makes you a 
little more comfortable knowing that there's family up in the 
stands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsay Benko won the 200-meter freestyle in 1:59.72, a personal  
best by nearly a full second and the eighth-best time by an 
American. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking 2 minutes is ``something that I've been working for for  
a year and a half, so it was definitely worthwhile,'' she said. 
``When I looked over and I had about 15 meters left I saw everybody 
on my team on the side of the pool all cheering. I thought, `Oh, my 
gosh, I have to be close,' so I'm like, `Just go, just give it all 
you have.' I did and I'm really happy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really never thought that I'd do it at this meet. I remember  
touching the wall and I didn't even know how to react. I was like 
so shocked. I couldn't believe it. The feeling was really cool, 
doing something that you've worked so hard for. It's like when you 
are little and you break a minute in the 100-yard freestyle. You 
finally break that barrier. It's a good feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaitlin Sandeno, 16, of Lake Forest, Calif., won her first  
career national title in convincing style, taking the 400-meter 
individual medley in 4:43.37, eighth-best by an American. It was a 
personal best by seven seconds. Sandeno was second in the 800 
freestyle on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I touched the wall, I thought, `Oh, my gosh' and I wanted  
to call my mom really bad,'' Sandeno said. ``I called her. She 
started crying and then I started crying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meet continues through Thursday.

<HEADLINE> INS To Send 200 Agents to 11 States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The immigration service is deploying 200  
agents to help state and local law enforcement agencies in 11 
states, building on a recently implemented shift in its interior 
enforcement strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris  
Meissner announced Tuesday formation of 45 quick response teams 
that will be sent to Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, 
Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress earmarked new money specifically for those states,  
which have seen a surge in immigrant smuggling in recent years, 
Meissner said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	As enforcement increased in recent years on the Southwest  
border, undocumented immigrants increasingly turn to smugglers to 
make their way farther inland. ``The patterns are changing, and 
this is a response to changing patterns,'' Meissner said. 
</P>
<P>
	INS moved this month to implement a new interior enforcement  
strategy that emphasizes combating criminal activities related to 
illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, the agency will concentrate on removing criminal  
aliens and cracking down on alien-smuggling rings, counterfeiters 
of documents and employers who team with smugglers to hire 
undocumented workers. 
</P>
<P>
	While INS officials contend the strategy will prove more  
effective, some critics suggest the agency is granting a de facto 
amnesty to the estimated 5.5 million people living illegally in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the strategy is attempting to do is strike at the heart  
... of dangerous and inhumane aspects of illegal immigration,'' 
Meissner said. She said the enforcement plan also is designed to 
reduce the illegal immigrant population and make communities safer. 
</P>
<P>
	The new quick-response teams, due to be in place by October,  
will comprise special agents and detention and deportation officers 
who will detain and remove undocumented immigrants encountered by 
law enforcers in the 11 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado will receive 31 quick response team personnel, followed  
by Missouri, with 25, and Nebraska, 23. Tennessee follows 21; Utah 
and Iowa, 20 each; Georgia and North Carolina, 16 apiece; Kentucky, 
13; Arkansas, 10; South Carolina, three; and Louisiana, two. 
</P>
<P>
	INS and Justice Department officials stressed that local law  
enforcement agencies are not being burdened with new 
responsibilities to enforce immigration laws as they work with the 
quick-response teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigrant advocates worry that a provision of the 1996  
immigration law could lead to such new enforcement activities by 
local police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	They point to an immigrant roundup conducted by local  
authorities in conjunction with the Border Patrol in Chandler, 
Ariz., 18 months ago. While 435 illegal immigrants were 
apprehended, legal residents also were stopped, and some claimed 
they were targeted because of their ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials last month settled a $35 million federal  
civil-rights lawsuit filed by U.S.-born Hispanics and legal 
immigrants stopped during the five-day sweep, agreeing to pay the 
plaintiffs $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Rapp, a U.S. attorney in Iowa who has worked with INS on  
development of the interior enforcement strategy, was emphatic 
Tuesday that such incidents are not the intent of the new program. 
``We're not talking about the local law enforcement agents being 
involved in immigration enforcement,'' Rapp declared.

	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey Nets backup center Jim  
McIlvaine had shoulder surgery Tuesday and will likely miss the 
rest of the season. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Delays Affect Govt. Pension Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal agency that guarantees pensions when  
employers go bankrupt insists it is fixing a problem that has made 
people repay sometimes huge amounts of money because of long agency 
delays in calculating proper benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	David Strauss, executive director of the Pension Benefit  
Guaranty Corp., said Monday problems highlighted by a new inspector 
general's audit have largely been corrected with changes begun in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency ``has worked aggressively to speed up processing time  
and now has systems in place to correct past deficiencies,'' 
Strauss said. 
</P>
<P>
	The audit found that among 278 people who wrote to the Pension  
Benefit Guaranty Corp. from April 1996 to April 1998 about delays 
in calculating proper benefits, 39 had combined overpayments of 
$529,994, including one who owed the government $152,525 for 
overpayments over a 14-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	Other problems include reductions in monthly payments with  
little explanation and guidelines for dealing with pensioners that 
don't adequately explain the accounting delays, agency inspector 
general Wayne Robert Poll said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Special  
Committee on Aging, released the audit Monday. He cited the case of 
a 75-year-old widow who waited eight years for a final 
determination of how much she would receive, then was told she owed 
the agency $5,667. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, pensioners are being hurt,'' Grassley said.  
``This is not the way for government to treat people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., created in 1974, protects  
the retirements of 42 million workers against the bankruptcy of 
their employers. As of Sept. 30, the agency already was the trustee 
or was becoming the trustee for 2,665 pension plans that lacked the 
money to meet their obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the agency paid out $848 million in benefits to  
210,000 people. None of these people is failing to get on time at 
least a part of promised retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems occur because the agency pays an estimated benefit  
until a more detailed investigation is done and an ``initial 
determination letter'' of the correct amount is sent out. If there 
has been an overpayment, the retiree must reimburse the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a sample of 96,000 participants from 1974 to 1996, the  
audit found most initial determinations took five years. Sixteen 
percent took 11 to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said, however, it has tripled the number of benefit  
determinations made each year, from 20,000 prior to 1994 to 60,000 
now, and reduced the waiting time to 3.2 years on average. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Poll told Grassley in a letter that the agency's moves to  
improve worker performance ``do not include a timeliness 
standard.'' He said questions remain about the reliability of its 
data on how many initial determination letters are waiting to be 
sent. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Poll wrote, ``there appears to be a gap'' between  
the agency's views of the impact of this delay on people and the 
problems that actually occur. Citing the agency's own pensioner 
focus groups, letters and customer surveys, Poll said many feel 
they can't adequately plan for the future, have difficulty repaying 
overpaid amounts and are frustrated in getting explanations from 
the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eight percent of the participants thought the delay ... had  
caused illness,'' Poll wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	To Grassley, all this indicates the agency ``needs a lesson in  
customer service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Strauss said the agency does ``recognize that processing  
delays adversely affect participants. In the future, we expect to 
accelerate the time even more.''

<HEADLINE>  Marine Regrets Destruction of Tape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- The navigator of the Marine jet that  
cut a ski lift cable in the Italian Alps said it was ``stupid'' to 
destroy the videotape that captured part of the flight that led to 
20 deaths last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I did was wrong,'' said Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, who  
faces up to 10 years in prison after pleading guilty Monday to 
charges of obstruction and conspiracy to obstruct justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here today to take responsibility for my actions,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., said he swapped the videotape  
he shot for a blank one after the EA-6B Prowler jet landed at the 
NATO base in Aviano, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	He explained that he took the tape because he didn't want it to  
become an issue in what he thought would be a probe of the tragedy 
by Italian authorities. At the time, there was no Marine Corps 
criminal probe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Let's take the tape,''' to pilot Capt. Richard Ashby,  
Schweitzer said. ``It was a stupid thing to do and I regret that. 
It was a rash decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys arrived in court today to begin selecting a sentencing  
jury. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison 
but lawyers have not said what sentencing limits were agreed to in 
Schweitzer's plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer said that at one point during the flight he had  
pointed the camera at himself and smiled. Ashby had warned him that 
the Italian media and authorities would ``eat you alive'' if they 
saw the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	``The video had nothing to do with the mishap,'' Schweitzer  
said. ``It wasn't on in the valley. I didn't want it to be an 
issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, Schweitzer said he tossed the original tape into  
a fire. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had stopped taping about 10 minutes before the jet  
streaked toward the Cavalese valley at 620 mph in February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The wing of the Prowler cut the ski gondola cable when the jet  
dropped to 370 feet above the valley floor. Three Italians, two 
Poles, seven Germans, five Belgians, two Austrians and one Dutch 
passenger died. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe is the type of guy who wants to stand up and take  
responsibility,'' said Dave Beck, Schweitzer's attorney. ``There 
were some bad mistakes made after the accident and they made bad 
decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was acquitted by a military  
jury at Camp Lejeune of manslaughter and other charges on March 4, 
outraging Italian authorities and straining relations with the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tragedy that becomes more confusing as the evidence  
is destroyed,'' said John Arthur Eaves Sr., an attorney 
representing the families of the German victims in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Three relatives of victims of the accident will be allowed to  
testify that the missing tape leaves a doubt about why their loved 
ones died. Other evidence includes affidavits from Schweitzer's 
squadron mates who are back at Aviano flying missions over 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appreciate Schweitzer's honesty,'' said Lorenzo Dellai,  
president of the Italian province of Trento, the region where the 
accident occurred. ``It is a contribution to clearness, which has 
always been lacking in this sad story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashbyfaces trial on the same obstruction charges next month.

<HEADLINE> Japan Steel Exports Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese steel exports fell in February for the  
first time in 25 months as shipments to the United States declined 
sharply amid a bilateral trade dispute, the Japan Steel Federation 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's steel exports totaled 1.73 million metric tons in  
February, down 13.3 percent from the same month the previous year, 
said federation spokesman Yoshihisa Hino. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's steel exports to the United States plummeted 51.1  
percent to 215,000 metric tons for the third straight monthly 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has been accusing Japan of dumping steel in  
U.S. markets and has threatened to impose penalty duties if the 
practice does not stop. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. steel industry filed a dumping complaint last year  
against Japanese competitors after their U.S. sales surged last 
year to 2 1/2 times the 1997 level.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Begins To Oust $10B Trustees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- At least two trustees who manage a $10 billion  
estate must be replaced immediately because their self-serving 
misbehavior cost a generation of Hawaiian children their education, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Margery Bronster has petitioned the Probate  
Court to remove trustees Henry Peters and Richard ``Dickie'' Wong 
on an interim basis, contending their presence threatens the 
integrity of the Bishop Estate, whose sole beneficiary is the 
Kamehameha Schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1997, Peters, Wong and fellow trustees Gerard Jervis,  
Lokelani Lindsey and Oswald Stender have been involved in a 
melodrama of boardroom intrigue, questionable investments, IRS 
audits and criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Several petitions seeking their removal are working through the  
courts. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Deputy Attorney General Hugh Jones said in court that  
Peters and Wong violated the dictates of Princess Bernice Pauahi 
Bishop's 1884 will, creating ``nothing less than an educational 
tragedy'' for children of Hawaiian ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones accused the pair of leading a self-serving and  
conflict-infested investment policy that ``spread through the 
institution like a cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, the state accuses trustees of investing $350  
million in income instead of following the will's direction and 
spending it on the Kamehameha Schools, located on a 600-acre campus 
overlooking Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
	``An entire generation of children were denied an education that  
could have been provided from the princess' legacy,'' Jones told 
Probate Judge Colleen Hirai at the start of the expected five-week 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	But Peters' attorney, Renee Yuen, countered that the princess  
would look down at Peters ``and say `Job well done. You have 
provided for the needs of Hawaii's children.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Peters has been indicted for theft for allegedly receiving a  
$192,500 kickback in a land deal involving Wong's brother-in-law. 
Wong is being investigated in the same scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Bronster's original petition also sought the interim removal of  
trustees Lokelani Lindsey and Gerard Jervis, but a judge last week 
ruled that Lindsey's removal already is being considered in a 
lawsuit filed by Jervis and Stender. 
</P>
<P>
	That judge also granted more time for Jervis to recover from his  
suicide attempt in early March. The overdose of sleeping pills came 
a week after the suicide of an estate attorney caught having sex 
with Jervis in the men's room of a swank Waikiki hotel.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Japan Near Investment Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The United States and Japan have moved closer to  
reaching agreement on steps to make it easier for foreign companies 
to invest in the Japanese market, a U.S. government official said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides plan to finish a joint report on foreign  
investment in Japan before Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi meets 
President Bill Clinton during a visit to Washington in early May, 
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very close to an agreement on substance,'' the official  
said, adding the measures will mark ``significant progress'' in 
improving the investment climate for foreign firms in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was discussed during two days of bilateral talks in  
Tokyo which finished Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report will focus on promoting mergers and acquisitions,  
trimming restrictions on land availability and increasing labor 
market mobility, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the official said the United States was disappointed  
with the lack of swift action to liberalize Japan's 
telecommunication market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, the pace of telecommunications deregulation has  
slowed,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ray Miller Misses Ripkin's Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Ray Miller dutifully managed the  
Baltimore Orioles against the Montreal Expos, but his heart wasn't 
entirely into the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles sent four players and a good portion of the coaching  
staff to Maryland on Tuesday for the funeral of Cal Ripken Sr., who 
died Thursday of lung cancer at age 63. 
</P>
<P>
	B.J. Surhoff, Chris Hoiles and Harold Baines missed the Orioles'  
last game of the spring at Fort Lauderdale Stadium. General manager 
Frank Wren and coaches Eddie Murray, Elrod Hendricks and Tim Bishop 
were at the funeral, as was trainer Richie Bancells. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Ripken Jr. left the team March 23 to be with his father, who  
spent 36 years with the organization as a player, scout, coach and 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, who served as a pitching coach under Ripken, wrestled  
with his conscience before deciding to stay in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd give anything in the world to be there. I should probably  
be there more than anybody,'' Miller said. ``But I told Frank if we 
have to make player cuts that I didn't think it was right -- nor did 
I think Cal would think it was right -- that someone else tell (the 
player) after he's been here for six weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flags were at half staff at the stadium and the crowd was asked  
to observe a moment of silence before the game. The Orioles wore 
No. 7 on their sleeves -- Ripken's number in Baltimore -- and will 
continue to do so in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles added three players from their minor league camp to  
fill out the roster -- outfielders Johnny Isom and Eugene Kingsdale 
and infielder Augie Ojeda.

<HEADLINE> MTV Names Chief of Online Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MTV Networks on Tuesday named music TV veteran  
Fred Seibert to lead its new Internet division as the company gears 
up for making further inroads into online media. 
</P>
<P>
	MTV's parent company, media conglomerate Viacom Inc., created  
the MTV Networks Online unit a month ago in order to pool together 
the successful Web sites for MTV, VH1 and Nickelodeon and to create 
new sites aimed at luring in music lovers and children. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the new projects in the works call for creating a Web  
site especially for kids, with moderated chat rooms, audiovisual 
content from Nickelodeon and an online toy store, and a music 
destination with a customizable online radio feature, concert

<HEADLINE> Germans Get New Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Germany's new finance minister, Hans  
Eichel, will take office April 12, the government announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The successor to Oskar Lafontaine will receive his certificate  
of ministerial office from President Roman Herzog at a brief 
evening ceremony in Berlin, a spokeswoman for the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eichel's ministerial powers start with the ceremony, although  
his installation will not be complete until his swearing-in in the 
Bundestag, or parliament, on April 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The leftist Lafontaine resigned suddenly March 11 in a struggle  
with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder over economic policy. His rivalry 
with the more business-friendly chancellor had hurt the 
government's image. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Eichel, a tax expert and the governor of Hesse  
state before being tapped for foreign minister, is known for a more 
pragmatic, market-oriented approach matching Schroeder's centrist 
orientation.

<HEADLINE> Yale Program Leader To Step Aside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- The director of a Yale University  
program gathering evidence of genocide by the Khmer Rouge in 
Cambodia is stepping down, five months after being cleared of 
misappropriating State Department money. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Kiernan, who founded the Cambodian Genocide Program in 1994  
with a State Department grant, said Tuesday that he will leave Yale 
for a few months beginning in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiernan plans to take up a summer fellowship at Melbourne  
University in his native Australia. He said he wants to work on a 
history of 20th century, state-sponsored mass slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	Yale officials said his temporary departure and decision to  
withdraw as program director had nothing to do with the accusations 
of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government began investigating Kiernan and the  
program after Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., wrote to Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright and said Kiernan might have been 
mismanaging the program and embezzling federal funds. Campbell 
based his allegations on the claims of a constituent he refused to 
name. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiernan denied the allegations. In November, the State  
Department said investigators found no evidence of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiernan, a professor of history since 1990 at Yale, is scheduled  
to return in the fall and resume teaching.

<P>
	The Cambodian Genocide Project was established to document  
crimes against humanity, assemble legal expertise and prepare 
historical evidence for possible prosecutions of the Khmer Rouge, 
which terrorized Cambodia from 1975 to 1979.

<HEADLINE> Commerce Dept. Making Census Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Commerce officials Monday said they are still  
trying to come up with a final budget estimate for conducting the 
2000 Census, attributing delays to a Supreme Court ruling over 
sampling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not, at this time, able to prepare a number that we can  
make public,'' said Commerce Deputy Secretary Robert Mallett. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration had hoped to use statistical sampling  
in conducting the census. The Supreme Court, however, ruled in 
January that sampling could not be used for the reapportionment of 
Congress. The Census Bureau is now planning to do the census using 
only the more traditional door-to-door head count to determine how 
many House seats each state gets. 
</P>
<P>
	Mallet said the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census  
Bureau, originally estimated the overall census process would cost 
$5 billion. The Supreme Court ruling ``obviously caused us to shift 
a bit and go back and redo budget numbers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning April 1, 2000, census questionnaires will be mailed to  
some 100 million households and census workers will hit the streets 
trying to find people who don't respond. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the largest peacetime mobilization that America  
conducts,'' Commerce Undersecretary Robert Shapiro said of the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is like going to war or putting a man on the moon. It is  
an activity of that level of complexity,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Terry Nichols Faces State Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- A district judge from outside Oklahoma  
County likely will oversee the case against Terry Nichols, now 
facing state murder charges on top of his federal convictions in 
the Oklahoma City bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Bob Macy said meetings were held Tuesday to  
decide how to go about selecting a judge. District Judge Dan Owens 
earlier said he intends to ask the state Supreme Court to appoint 
someone from outside the county to avoid ``the appearance of 
impropriety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Macy said the 160 murder charges -- one for each bombing victim --  
filed Monday against Nichols are on hold until a judge is found. 
</P>
<P>
	``That will be a big step,'' he said. ``Once a judge is  
appointed he can go ahead and appoint defense counsel and then we 
can sit down and see if there are things we can agree on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols, 43, could face the death penalty if convicted in state  
court. He already is serving a federal life sentence after being 
convicted in the deaths of eight law officers who died in the April 
19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal jurors in Denver convicted Nichols on Dec. 23, 1997, for  
conspiring to bomb the building and eight counts of involuntary 
manslaughter in the deaths of the law officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bomber Timothy McVeigh was convicted by a separate federal jury  
in Denver and sentenced to die.

<HEADLINE> Electric Deregulation Report Issued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government study concludes electricity  
deregulation would lead to rate cuts for consumers in 26 states, 
but increase them in 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department report issued Monday does not predict  
how much rates would go up, but says rural America would need a 
``safety net'' ranging from $1 billion in 2000 to $2.4 billion in 
2015 to offset them. 
</P>
<P>
	The report predicts deregulation would lead to lower rates for  
consumers mainly in the Southwest, Northeast and southern Plains, 
but raise them in the Pacific Northwest, Mountain states, Mid-South 
and in the northern Plains, as well as in some Great Lakes states. 
The report focused on the 45 states with rural electric 
cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen states have already moved toward opening their  
electricity markets, but efforts in Congress to enact deregulation 
legislation have bogged down in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration announced a deregulation plan last  
year that it said would save consumers $20 billion a year. It would 
call for open competition nationwide among electricity suppliers by 
2003 but would also let states ``opt out'' of the program if they 
believed competition would not help them. 
</P>
<P>
	While the report does not dispute the administration's view that  
it would save consumers $20 billion in all, it found the savings 
will be concentrated in some states. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., sent copies of the report to all  
Oregon legislators and urged them to resist a push for electricity 
deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
	An Agriculture Department spokesman, Andrew Kauders, said the  
report was leaked before it was finished and that people should not 
draw conclusions from it.

<HEADLINE> Technology Spurs Subliminal Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- TV viewers probably barely noticed the Coca-Cola  
can on a desk and the Wells Fargo billboard in the background of a 
recent episode of UPN's drama ``Seven Days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The actors certainly didn't notice -- because the soda can and  
billboard weren't even there when the series was filmed. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first prime-time test of a technology that allows  
advertisers to have products digitally added to a scene, a practice 
that could blur beyond recognition the line between entertainment 
and advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The product placements were quietly done as an experiment during  
one episode two weeks ago to gauge viewer reaction. The response is 
still being evaluated, UPN spokesman Paul McGuire said. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology has been used in sports, to add commercial  
billboards in the background of baseball games. 
</P>
<P>
	Product placement is popular in movies but much less so on  
television, where there are plenty of opportunities to run 
full-fledged ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet it's starting to get harder to tell when the ads end and the  
show begins. 
</P>
<P>
	Networks sprinkle stars from their prime-time shows in the  
audience at sporting events for cameras to spot during big games. 
ABC last month promoted a show with a ``crawl'' along the bottom of 
the screen, treatment usually reserved for news bulletins. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is certainly a sense that the bleeding of the  
commercials into the programs is getting more extreme than it ever 
has been,'' said Robert Thompson, director of the Center for the 
Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University. 
</P>
<P>
	For many years, networks took pains to avoid product placement.  
The results often looked awkward: Actors would drink from a beer 
bottle with a generic label instead of a Budweiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Showing actual products may better reflect real life, but the  
decision on whether to use them should rest with the people making 
the shows, not with advertisers, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear whether Christopher Crowe, creator and executive  
producer of ``Seven Days,'' had a choice. He didn't return calls 
for comment. He works for Paramount, which owns both the series and 
the network. 
</P>
<P>
	A Paramount spokeswoman noted that the technology has other uses  
beyond advertising. Producers may be able to insert special effects 
or background locations at relatively low cost, Trisha Cardoso 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new technology isn't likely to replace regular commercials,  
some experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see it taking off like a rocket,'' said Ave Butensky,  
president of the Television Bureau of Advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	People see so many commercial messages in real life -- on  
clothing, in shop windows, even in school -- that product placement 
on TV shows may be too subtle, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the most part this stuff becomes absolutely invisible to  
us in real life,'' he said. ``I imagine it would become invisible 
to us in imaginary life just as quickly.''

<P>
	KUKES, Albania (AP) -- By day they wander the rutted streets,  
with no idea where to go or what to do. At night they sleep in 
doorways or on sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
	The tens of thousands of Kosovo Albanian refugees pouring into  
northern Albania have overwhelmed meager resources in an 
impoverished region of one of the world's poorest countries. They 
also were stretching the resources of Montenegro and Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, Belgium, NATO, the European Union and aid agencies  
moved to halt the unfolding humanitarian chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to stop this catastrophe and stop this  
killing,'' NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said Monday after a 
meeting at NATO headquarters with the European Union's outgoing 
commissioner for humanitarian affairs, Emma Bonino. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonino, who will travel to Macedonia and Albania on Wednesday,  
said the refugee situation in the region is worsening by the hour. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kukes, dozens gathered Monday in front of the city  
administration building while a local official read out names over 
a megaphone of children, elderly people, husbands and wives looking 
for family members they lost track of during their arduous journey. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. refugee agency showed up with all the food it could  
muster -- 5,000 loaves of bread. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no registration of refugees, so we're literally just  
handing out food,'' said Paul Benson of the International Medical 
Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Albanian authorities simply cannot cope with the human tide, and  
international organizations are scrambling to set up operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need everything,'' sighed Xhemil Shahu, a staffer of the  
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees trying to cope with what 
Western officials say is shaping up as the worst humanitarian 
disaster in Europe since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 80,000 and 100,000 Kosovo Albanian refugees have arrived  
in northern Albania, more than double the rate of a few days 
earlier, the U.N. relief agency said Monday. Thousands more headed 
west to Montenegro and southeast to Macedonia, allegedly prodded by 
Serb troops. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO estimates that more than 500,000 ethnic Albanians -- one  
fourth of the province's population -- have been displaced in the 
yearlong conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	The UNHCR will start airlifting supplies to refugees in Albania,  
a spokesman said in Geneva today. UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski 
said the British government had supplied a transport plane which 
would shuttle supplies from the Danish capital Copenhagen into the 
Albanian capital Tirana. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Morini border crossing, an Albanian policeman tried to  
register the arriving refugees, but he says it's difficult to count 
when they walk in crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who managed to escape with Western money -- primarily  
German marks -- can catch rides with local Albanians who charge up 
to $60 for the brief journey to Kukes. 
</P>
<P>
	Those without money end up walking. Along the road, crowds of  
ethnic Albanians bunched together as they trudged down the mountain 
pass beneath snow-covered peaks. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15 buses chartered by the government arrived late Monday.  
But as police tried to help people get on buses, many refugees 
refused to do so until they had located all members of their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not found my family yet,'' said Shefki Morina, 55, from  
Pec. ``I'm going nowhere without them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kukes, located about 10 miles southwest of the Kosovo border, is  
the first major town that ethnic Albanians refugees reach. But the 
drab-looking community of small stores and large, decaying 
apartment blocks barely has services for its own population of 
20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Before fighting erupted in Kosovo last year, the town survived  
by trading with Prizren, Kosovo's second largest city 25 miles to 
the northeast. After fighting broke out, Yugoslavia closed the 
border, depriving Kukes of its economic lifeblood. 
</P>
<P>
	Townspeople have put up about 5,000 refugees in private homes.  
Another 5,000 have been given shelter in empty warehouses, where 
the local Red Cross feed them cookies and water. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority, however, must fend for themselves.

chose to stand defiant and risk a verdict in an important legal 
fight that bore extraordinary parallels to its current courtroom 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Accused of illegally bundling a competitor's technology into its  
dominant computer operating system, Microsoft lost that lawsuit in 
1994 and was ordered by jurors to pay $120 million in damages to a 
small industry rival. 
</P>
<P>
	For Microsoft, that courtroom loss remains a clear reminder of  
the perils of taking an unyielding position at the bargaining 
table. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very tough and aggressive in everything they do,''  
said Morgan Chu, the lawyer who represented Stac Electronics Corp. 
in failed settlement talks with Microsoft in 1993 but beat the 
software maker in court a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's true in the way they market products, the way they  
conduct business negotiations -- and it's true in the way they 
conduct litigation,'' Chu remembered. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's attorneys met for two hours Tuesday evening in  
Washington with lawyers from the Justice Department and 19 states 
suing it over alleged antitrust violations. The trial is in a 
six-week recess, and both sides are under orders from the judge to 
try to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said it wouldn't discuss the talks.  
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's lawyers included William Neukom, its top in-house  
attorney and a former senior partner in the law firm of Bill Gates' 
father, and Richard Urowsky, who negotiated a 1995 consent decree 
with the Justice Department that avoided antitrust charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles ``Rick'' Rule, a former senior Justice official who now  
works as a legal consultant for Microsoft, also attended the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts agree that an out-of-court settlement is unlikely  
because the sides remain far apart after close to five months of a 
bitter courtroom fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft illegally wields monopoly  
power over computer operating systems, and it adds features to its 
Windows software to extend its influence into emerging areas of new 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said last week it won't accept restrictions on what  
new features it can add to Windows. The government insists any 
settlement must ensure that the industry can develop technology 
without any threat from Microsoft's dominance. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides appear in court Wednesday to talk with U.S. District  
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson about the trial schedule. Jackson is 
occupied with a criminal case taking longer than expected, so the 
Microsoft trial may not resume until mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in negotiations, Microsoft is pushing ahead with its legal  
fight. The company already is working on a possible appeal. Also, 
it asked the judge Monday to make America Online, Netscape 
Communications and Sun Microsystems turn over more e-mails about 
AOL's recent $9.9 billion purchase of Netscape and a related deal 
with Sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new alliance intends to compete with Microsoft in  
virtually every area of technology,'' spokesman Mark Murray said. 
``AOL, Netscape and Sun shouldn't be allowed to hide the ball on 
issues central to this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sun said it provided all the documents requested.  
</P>
<P>
	``We did a thorough production when we complied with the  
subpoena, and we believe we satisfied the requirements in good 
faith,'' spokeswoman Lisa Poulson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also won permission to interview AOL's chairman, Steve  
Case, and three other executives. Lawyers expect those interviews 
in April. 
</P>
<P>
	In its 1993 lawsuit, Stac accused Microsoft of patent  
infringement, not an antitrust violation, for including its 
``Stacker'' data-compression technology in its MS-DOS operating 
system, the precursor to Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft bundled Internet software  
with Windows to try to crush rival Netscape. It also holds that 
Microsoft included a ``polluted'' version of a new technology by 
Sun to prevent its use with software other than Microsoft's. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike in Microsoft's current case, the company's billionaire  
chairman testified personally in 1993. But Stac lawyers used Gates' 
own e-mail to try to discredit him, much as the government has done 
over past weeks in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lost the Stac case for $120 million and was ordered to  
recall versions of its software with the technology. It later 
settled with Stac for $83 million by promising not to appeal. The 
same jury also awarded Microsoft $13.6 million in a counterclaim.

<HEADLINE> Golf Panel To Study Course Setup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The PGA Tour learned long ago that it can't please everybody.  
But it will at least listen to suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	Some players have complained about greens so firm and fast that  
it gives an advantage to the long, high hitters. The complaints 
came even before The Players Championship, which produced the 
highest winning score (285) since it moved to the TPC at Sawgrass. 
</P>
<P>
	During the players meeting last week, a committee was appointed  
to study course setups. It will meet again during the MCI Classic 
the week after the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The feedback we got was to make the greens harder and  
faster,'' said Davis Love III, a member of the policy board. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, guys are going back the other way, saying they're too  
firm and fast. No matter what you do, you can't make everybody 
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most valid complaints about the Sawgrass was the combination  
of rock-hard greens that wouldn't even hold a wedge, and 4-inch 
rough around the green that made it almost impossible to get the 
ball close. 
</P>
<P>
	The best suggestion came from the winner, David Duval. He says  
if the greens are going to be like concrete, make sure the rough is 
shaved around them so players can use some skill trying to get up 
and down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let us at least try to play from around the green,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SILLY STATS:* So, you think the world ranking system was goofy  
when Tiger Woods continued to be ranked No. 1 over David Duval? 
</P>
<P>
	Get a load out of PGA Tour's all-around statistic this week.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval is the leader in greens hit in regulation AND putting  
average, which explains why he's at the top of the most important 
category of all -- scoring average. At 68.28, he's almost a full 
stroke ahead of the next player, Davis Love III. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval also leads in most birdies and total driving, a  
combination of driving distance (No. 8) and driving accuracy (No. 
25). 
</P>
<P>
	So who is No. 1 in the all-around category?  
</P>
<P>
	Vijay Singh, who else?  
</P>
<P>
	PGA Tour spokesman Dave Lancer says the all-around category  
measures the top statistical performance. Singh is ranked in the 
top 10 in three categories, and is no lower than 44th in any of the 
nine areas. 
</P>
<P>
	So why is Duval No. 2 in the all-around? He's ranked 108th in  
sand saves. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *AMATEUR HOUR:* With a short game reminiscent of another Spanish  
master, Seve Ballesteros, Sergio Garcia made short work of Hank 
Kuehne in the second annual Georgia Cup, a match between the 
winners of the British Amateur and U.S. Amateur. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, the 19-year-old expected to turn pro after the Masters  
next week, was 3-under for his round when he closed out the 
long-hitting Kuehne 6 and 4 at the Golf Club of Georgia on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very good event, and a great preparation for  
Augusta,'' Garcia said. ``The course is wonderful and the greens 
are fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RYDER CUP RUMBLINGS:* With his 4-under 68 in the final round of  
The Players Championship, Fred Couples moved up from a tie for 40th 
to a tie for fourth. That was worth about $200,000, and some 
valuable Ryder Cup points. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of getting no points, Couples picked up 75 with his  
fabulous finish and moved from 12th to seventh in the U.S. 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
	That may not seem like a big deal now, but they could prove to  
be valuable come August. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get down to the last couple of weeks, it's immense,''  
Couples said. ``I'd hate to be the guy in the ninth or 10th spot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couples knows what it's like to be in the position of trying to  
make the Ryder Cup team in the last tournament, the PGA 
Championship, which just happens to be the last major. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like going to the British Open and saying, 'OK, everybody  
who doesn't play well has to stay here for two more weeks and then 
take the boat home,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *EUROPEAN TOUR:* The European women's tour has taken a page from  
the LPGA when it comes to increasing purses -- simply increase the 
number of tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	That's an important step in Europe, where the women's tour has  
suffered over the past decade because all of its top players are in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our aim this year is to increase the playing opportunities for  
our members, and to provide them with a more attractive career 
structure in Europe so they do not feel quite so inclined to go to 
America to make a good living,'' said Tim Howland, the new chief 
executive of the women's tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The three new events this year are the Laura Davies'  
Invitational, the Tour Players Championship and the Ladies Italian 
Open. The total prize money is up $1.45 million to $5.3 million, 
and the Evian Masters will offer $1.12 million, the highest purse 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* Jane Reynolds, an LPGA tournament official since 1991,  
has become the first woman named to the PGA of America Rules 
Committee. Reynolds will work the PGA Seniors' Championship in two 
weeks. ... The Golf Channel's interview with Jack Nicklaus included 
footage of his first full swing since hip replacement surgery. ... 
The 2001 U.S. Women's Mid-Amateur Championship will take place at 
Fox Run Golf Club in Eureka, Mo. ... Michelle McGann and Andrew 
Magee will serve as national chairmen for the American Junior Golf 
Association. ... This year's Diners Club Matches will be played at 
Pelican Hill Golf Club in Newport Beach, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MONEY MATTERS:* Karrie Webb has won $486,996 in seven events on  
the LPGA Tour. She has won three times and has not finished out of 
the top 10, including third place in the first major championship 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Gump finished second in The Players Championship and won  
$540,000. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STAT OF THE WEEK:* The top two in The Players Championships  
(David Duval and Scott Gump) and the top two on the money list 
(Duval and Jeff Maggert) are all graduates of the Nike Tour.

<HEADLINE> Jazz Singer Joe Williams Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Joe Williams, whose smooth baritone and  
collaborations with Count Basie won him acclaim as one of the great 
voices of jazz, collapsed and died on a city street after walking 
away from a hospital. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams apparently died of natural causes, Clark County Coroner  
Ron Flud said. He had walked several miles Monday and was a few 
blocks from home. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Jillean, said he had been admitted to Sunrise Hospital  
a week ago for a respiratory ailment. The hospital reported 
Williams missing several hours before his body was found. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer Robert Goulet said: ``At the age of 80, Joe could sing  
better than most people at the age of 20. He was one of the 
greatest jazz and blues singers of all time, and he was such a good 
man, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' appeal stretched to other mediums: He played Bill  
Cosby's father-in-law, Grandpa Al, on ``The Cosby Show'' in the 
1980s. He and Cosby were friends, and the childhood memories 
Grandpa Al spun on the show were his own from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	But his fame was in jazz. Williams became a sensation in 1955  
when he recorded ``Everyday I Have the Blues'' with Basie, and the 
two were together for seven years. Williams repeatedly was chosen 
the top male jazz singer in readers' polls for Downbeat and other 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm most pleasantly surprised at what still comes out of my  
throat,'' Williams said in an 1986 interview. ``I'm thrilled and 
thankful. I remember Edward (Duke Ellington) saying, `I'm just a 
messenger boy for God.' Much of what we do comes through us. I 
thank God for what comes through me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born Joseph Goreed on Dec. 12, 1918, in Cordele, Ga., the  
entertainer was raised by his mother and grandmother. He found fun 
in playing the piano and singing the spirituals he heard at the 
Methodist church where his mother was the organist. 
</P>
<P>
	In his teens in the 1930s, he led the singing group The Jubilee  
Boys in performances in Chicago churches. He later sang solo in a 
Chicago club, and made his professional debut in 1937 with the late 
Jimmy Noone. 
</P>
<P>
	His big break came in 1943, when Williams was working as a  
security guard to support himself. He wound up guarding the front 
door of the Regal Theater and met jazz luminaries such as Duke 
Ellington. The Regal's manager sent Williams to the Tick Tock in 
Boston to join Lionel Hampton's band, which had its own powerhouse 
blues singer, Dinah Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The magic came with Basie. Williams said Basie hired him on the  
advice of his band. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basie said, `I can't give you what you're worth. But, things  
get better for me, they get better for you.' I had the good sense 
to go with him,'' Williams recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	The two played together from 1954 to 1961, and Williams often  
performed with Basie until his death in 1984; Williams dedicated 
his renditions of ``You Are So Beautiful'' to Basie. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a talent, he was one of the best blues singers in the world  
and also one of the best ballad singers,'' added friend and singer 
Buddy Greco. ``There will never be anyone like him, again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Bennett recalled Williams once telling him: ``It's not that  
you want to sing, it's that you have to sing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He defined who I really am,'' Bennett said in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
	Even in his later years, Williams sang on cruise ships, at  
festivals, in hotels and clubs, working about 40 weeks a year. He 
was an avid golfer. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides his wife, Williams is survived by his son, Joe; and his  
daughter, Anne. Funeral information was not immediately available.

<HEADLINE> ASNE, AP Announce Diversity Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Associated Press Managing Editors and  
American Society of Newspaper Editors announced a project Monday 
with the purpose of making certain that the pages of newspapers 
mirror the racial and ethnic mix of their communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order for a newspaper to be accurate, it should look like  
its community,'' said David Yarnold, managing editor of the San 
Jose (Calif.) Mercury News and diversity chairman of the APME. 
</P>
<P>
	The project, called ``The National Time-Out for Diversity and  
Accuracy,'' asks reporters and editors to meet during the week of 
May 17-21 to discuss ways that race and ethnicity affect choices of 
what is covered and who is assigned to cover it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not suggesting the creation of quotas for types of  
sources or creating some artificial framework for our journalism,'' 
Yarnold said. ``We want to reframe the issue of diversity as an 
issue of accuracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This project addresses coverage. In 1978, ASNE set a goal to  
make minority representation inside newsrooms equal to the 
diversity in the U.S. population by 2000, or about 25 percent. ASNE 
Executive Director Scott Bosley says ethnic diversity in the 
newsroom has increased from about 4 percent of employees two 
decades ago to about 11 percent today.

<HEADLINE> Doherty Hired As Notre Dame Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Matt Doherty was hired Tuesday as  
basketball coach at Notre Dame with hopes the long-time Kansas 
assistant can return a lackluster program to national prominence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very proud moment in my life. Everything that Notre  
Dame stands for represents how I try to live my life,'' Doherty 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Growing up Irish Catholic in New York, you couldn't help  
follow Notre Dame, football and basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of Doherty's five-year contract were not disclosed. He  
replaces John MacLeod, who resigned under pressure March 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Dohterty, 37, passed up a chance to play at Notre Dame after he  
was lured to North Carolina by then-Tar Heels assistant Roy 
Williams. He went on to play on the 1982 national championship team 
with Michael Jordan and James Worthy before he graduated in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	He was drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers but never played in  
the NBA, instead working as a government bond salesmen in New York 
City and later as a part-time analyst on the Davidson College 
basketball radio network. 
</P>
<P>
	He then joined the Davidson coaching staff for three years  
before hooking up with Williams again, this time as an assistant at 
Kansas in 1993. Since he joined the staff, the Jayhawks have won 
five conference championships, appeared in the NCAA tournament six 
times and went to the NCAA tournament Final Four in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a passion about Notre Dame that really gave us the  
level of confidence that he would not only kick-start the program 
now but be our coach for a long time,'' athletic director Mike 
Wadsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doherty has already hired one assistant, Doug Wojcik, who has  
been an assistant for nine years at Navy, where he played. 
</P>
<P>
	Doherty inherits a program that finished 14-16 last season and  
has had only three winning seasons since MacLeod took over for the 
1991-92 season. Notre Dame's last trip to the NCAA tournament was 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish also have struggled in the Big East since joining the  
conference for the 1995-96 season. They have an 0-4 record in the 
conference tournament and an overall mark of 27-45 in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame returns three starters next season, including Big  
East rookie of the year Troy Murphy and fellow freshman David 
Graves. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame also has four available scholarships and two highly  
regarded recruits in Mike Monserez of Cincinnati, a 6-foot-5 guard, 
and Matt Carroll, a 6-5 guard from suburban Philadelphia considered 
one of the top 30 recruits in the nation.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Abortion Groups Lobby the U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Anti-abortion groups on Tuesday demanded  
that definitions on family planning approved by the U.S. Congress 
be included in a plan to slow global population growth. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 170 countries are wrapping up negotiations on  
proposals to implement a population agreement adopted at the U.N. 
conference in Cairo in 1994. The proposals will be presented to a 
special General Assembly session in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the demands, U.S. delegate Elizabeth Maguire said  
that ``the spirit and the letter'' of Congress are included in the 
proposals, which stress the importance of voluntary participation 
and informed consent in family planning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congress has ruled no U.S. funds may be spent on any  
government or organization that supports or runs ``a population 
program that is not voluntary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The language was included in an amendment to last fall's foreign  
aid bill and was repeated in a House resolution last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Inserting congressional language into the U.N. proposal ``would  
go beyond these existing restrictions to promote genuine national 
sovereignty on family planning policies,'' said Robert Maginnis, a 
director of the Washington-based Family Research Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-abortion coalition claims nations are often threatened  
with a cutoff of aid if they don't accept family planning programs. 
It says the congressional language would allow nations to opt out 
of family planning programs and still receive development 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Maguire, director of the Office of Population at the U.S. Agency  
for International Development, said the United States supports the 
latest draft proposals submitted Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's very strong language in there on ensuring voluntary,  
free and informed choices in a context of privacy, confidentiality 
and respect,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the pro-life coalition said it was dismayed that not ``a  
single aspect'' of the congressional language was used. The Vatican 
and Guatemala had pressed for its inclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Therefore, it is an empty glass and it can be filled any way  
that it wants to,'' said Austin Ruse, director of the Catholic 
Family and Human Rights Institute.

<HEADLINE> Walker Injured in Batting Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- After being injury-free for most of the  
spring, the Colorado Rockies lost star right fielder Larry Walker, 
possibly for several days, because of a strained muscle in his 
right rib cage. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker sustained the injury while hitting a home run during  
batting practice prior to Tuesday night's 6-1 loss to the Chicago 
White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those things that may be nagging over the next few  
days, but we'll see how he is,'' trainer Tom Probst said. ``We'll 
evaluate him tomorrow and go from there. A lot of times the 
soreness will diminish on its own. Or it could be worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the injury was severe enough to have kept Walker out of  
a regular-season game or if his being scratched from the lineup for 
an exhibition game was merely precautionary, Probst said: ``As much 
discomfort as he had, it probably would have kept him out of a 
regular-season game. With something like this, you have to rely on 
what the player tells you about how he feels.''

	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Two Michigan State students were suspended  
Tuesday for their role in last weekend's riot, and university 
officials say more suspensions are being considered. 
</P>
<P>
	The students, who aren't being named, received hand-delivered

	One student was accused of causing property damage and the other  
of interfering with emergency workers. Both incidents occurred on 
campus Saturday night in a rampage that began even before Michigan 
State lost to Duke in the NCAA tournament semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The university's code of conduct gives officials the right to  
suspend students before a hearing if the students present a ``clear 
and present danger'' to the campus, Pozega Osburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice president for student affairs Lee June made the decision to  
suspend the students because campus police reports gave him 
reasonable cause to believe that the students performed the 
activities, although he stressed that the charges are only 
allegations until a hearing is held. 
</P>
<P>
	June said hearings will be held as soon as the students schedule  
them with the campus's judicial office. The students may choose to 
have their cases heard by a student-faculty panel or by a 
university administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	June wouldn't say how many more suspensions are being  
considered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly the university is outraged and concerned, but there's  
also an issue of due process rights,'' he said. ``We have to wait 
for police reports, and as quickly as we get those, we review them. 
Then we act as quickly as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University president Peter McPherson had warned students about  
suspensions after the melee, in which more than 5,000 people lit 
fires, torched cars and squared off against police. About half of 
the 24 people arrested so far are Michigan State students.

<HEADLINE> McDougal Testifies About Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Susan McDougal testified today that she  
knows nothing about two checks, including one bearing her own 
signature, that raise questions about the truthfulness of President 
Clinton's testimony in the Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``According to what I know, everything that I know, Bill Clinton  
answered truthfully ... about all the ... questions he was asked 
that had anything to do with me,'' Mrs. McDougal said on her fifth 
day on the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton testified at Mrs. McDougal's 1996 trial that he never  
borrowed from the savings and loan owned by Mrs. McDougal and her 
husband, Jim, who were the president and Mrs. Clinton's partners in 
the Whitewater real estate venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Starr's office later found a $27,600 cashier's check  
that was a loan made payable to ``Bill Clinton'' from the S&AMP;L. The 
investigators also discovered a $5,081 check signed by Mrs. 
McDougal that was used to pay off part of the Clinton loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination by prosecutor Mark Barrett, Mrs.  
McDougal acknowledged her own signature on the $5,081 check, but 
she said she would have written the check on her ex-husband's 
instructions. And she reiterated an answer she gave last week that 
her impression on seeing the check recently was that it was for 
land the McDougals had in Clinton, Ark. In fact, the money paid off 
part of the loan made in Clinton's name. The $5,081 check bears the 
notation ``payoff Clinton'' in Mrs. McDougal's handwriting. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mrs. McDougal's criminal contempt and obstruction trial,  
Starr's office mapped out the Clinton loan and how it was paid off 
on a large chart. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand that chart that you made at all,'' Mrs.  
McDougal told Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal said she had no information to contradict  
Clinton's denials about taking out a loan and she noted that her 
ex-husband testified at the 1996 Whitewater trial that Clinton 
hadn't taken out a loan. Jim McDougal later cooperated with Starr's 
office, leading investigators to the loan in Clinton's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office has linked the Clinton loan and the $5,081 check  
signed by Mrs. McDougal with a fraudulent $300,000 loan to Mrs. 
McDougal made several years later, which Clinton denies knowing 
anything about. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyers have suggested that Jim McDougal  
arranged the $27,600 loan in Clinton's name without telling him 
about it.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Waiting for Word on Elway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- John Elway will retire from football financially  
secure and professionally revered. 
</P>
<P>
	It's just a matter of when.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think John is any more comfortable with retirement  
than most players,'' said Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen, still 
awaiting word on Elway's future. ``It's a difficult decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he demonstrated during his MVP performance in Denver's second  
straight Super Bowl victory, Elway still has life left in his 
38-year-old body. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos are hoping he returns for a 17th season, but are not  
setting a deadline as they prepare to start offseason conditioning 
April 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're putting any pressure on him to make up his  
mind at any particular point in time,'' Bowlen said. ``Whenever 
that is, that's fine with us. I don't know where he's headed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway's agent, Marvin Demoff, said he doesn't expect Elway to  
keep the Broncos waiting much longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I know is that he'd like to make a decision  
early enough so that his training would be appropriate,'' Demoff 
said Monday. ``If I had to guess, we're looking between the 15th of 
April and the 15th of May, but that is pure speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Elway announced his decision to return last June, he said  
he was 99.9 percent certain 1998 would be his last year. Pressed, 
Elway amended it to 100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But now that he's won another Super Bowl, the question has  
surfaced again. Jay Leno unsuccessfully tried to get Elway to tip 
his hand last month, and radio talk show hosts and newspaper 
columnists offer arguments for and against retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate always returns to one thing -- the lure of becoming  
the first quarterback in NFL history to win three straight Super 
Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were to win three in a row and he were the quarterback,  
it definitely establishes a new level,'' Bowlen said. ``If you're 
the only quarterback in history to win three Super Bowls in a row, 
I think that sets you apart from the rest of the pack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Elway received input from a variety of sources,  
including his father, Jack, Hall of Fame catcher Johnny Bench and 
former Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
	No one's advice, however, meant more to Elway than that of his  
wife Janet and their four children -- Jessica, 14; Jordan, 11; Jack, 
9; and Juliana, 8. All encouraged him to keep playing, and family 
advice figures to be key again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would think that's the biggest part of his decision,'' said  
Elway's personal aide, Kathy Hatch. ``They're a very close family, 
so I know that's going to weigh very heavily on his decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway made family a priority last summer, skipping Denver's  
first exhibition game to be with Janet when she underwent colon 
surgery. She later was hospitalized by complications. 
</P>
<P>
	All of which put Colorado's best-known couple and their  
multimillion-dollar lifestyle in a different light. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a car-pool dad,'' Hatch said. ``When Janet wasn't feeling  
well he even did grocery shopping. They're a very regular family, 
just as normal a family as you could find in this situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway has his own health to consider. After missing only 10  
games in his first 15 years, Elway sat out four games and was 
sidelined for parts of two others in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Age has its ways of sending messages. Elway was sidelined by two  
non-contact injuries -- a strained hamstring and back spasms -- and 
he had rib trouble after falling on the football. 
</P>
<P>
	``That could have happened in the best part of his career, so  
John's certainly capable of playing,'' Bowlen said. ``It's really 
just a decision of whether or not he feels he can stand up to all 
the stuff he has to go through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So while the auto dealerships that bear his name offer a  
three-day, 150-mile money-back guarantee on all new cars, opposing 
linebackers offer no such security to vulnerable quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a fan, you dread the day he's going to quit, but he's in  
one piece right now,'' Hatch said. ``I'd like to see him stay that 
way.''

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence Rises Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A strong economy and record stock market  
performance pumped up consumer confidence for a fifth-straight 
month in March, and many Americans expect the good times to 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board reported today that its index of consumer  
confidence rose a stronger-than-expected 0.8 point to 133.9 in 
March from a revised 133.1 in February. The index dropped sharply 
in October and has since been making a steady recovery. The upward 
revision by the business-financed research group made the February 
number even stronger than the 132.1 originally reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator because  
consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall 
economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers were more optimistic in the first quarter of this  
year than they were at the end of last year,'' said Lynn Franco, 
associate director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their appraisal of current business conditions continues to  
sail at record-high levels, with no signs that confidence will 
erode anytime soon. Consumers are continuing to count on steady 
business growth, low inflation and a strong job market through the 
remainder of the century,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey said it found an all-time low 11.8 percent of  
consumers who reported jobs are hard to get. It also reported more 
Americans said they would buy a home, though fewer said they would 
buy a major appliance or a car in the next six months. Fewer 
consumers expect business conditions to get better. 
</P>
<P>
	The index that measures feelings about present conditions rose  
slightly to 177.8 in March from a revised 177.7 in February, 
reaching another new high in the 32 years that the survey has been 
compiled. 
</P>
<P>
	The index that measures expectations for the next six months was  
also higher, rising 1.3 points to 104.7. 
</P>
<P>
	The rising stock market, punctuated by the Dow Jones Industrial  
Average closing for the first time above 10,000 on Monday, was 
cited by analysts as a big reason for the strong consumer 
confidence. But Americans are also less worried about losing their 
jobs, which helps the confidence index. 
</P>
<P>
	Home buying plans was still another positive factor. ``That is a  
shocker because home builders report reduced traffic, and interest 
rates are up,'' said Russ Sheldon, chief economist for Money Watch 
in New York. ``This is a pretty rambunctious bunch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report comes amid strong economic growth in the United  
States, which is surprising to many economists who had expected the 
pace to slow in early 1999 as global financial turmoil threatened 
American prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer confidence index, started in 1967, is compiled from  
responses to questions sent to 5,000 households nationwide. The 
survey polls consumers on matters ranging from job prospects to 
buying plans. The index compares results to its base year, 1985, 
when it stood at 100.

<HEADLINE> GOP Reps. Attack Russian Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two leading House Republicans said Tuesday  
they oppose more International Monetary Fund loans to Russia until 
the IMF provides a full accounting for previous outlays to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Tex., and Rep. Jim Saxton,  
R-N.J., vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, said the 
United States ``should use its influence to any deny further IMF 
loans to Russia'' until Congress is told what happened to $4.8 
billion lent last August. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, the lawmakers  
said, ``It seems quite possible that much of the $4.8 billion was 
lost in ... illegal arrangements. A substantial amount of the 
American taxpayer money given to the IMF may now be financing the 
lavish lifestyles of Russian oligarchs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the IMF said it had agreed on a framework for further  
financial aid to Russia after a weekend meeting between Russian 
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Michel Camdessus, managing 
director of the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF said details on the amount of aid and its timing will be  
worked out when an IMF team visits Moscow next week. Russia needs 
IMF loans to repay $17.5 billion in international debt that falls 
due this year, including $4.8 billion owed to the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund wants to move slowly on any new loan program because of  
suspicions that the Russian Central Bank may have channeled funds 
to secret offshore accounts as a protective measure during last 
summer's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin referred to the IMF concern about offshore movements in  
remarks to reporters Tuesday. ``I can assure you that was very much 
in their minds as they structured this (new) agreement,'' Rubin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Armey and Saxton said both the IMF and the Treasury should  
outline the ``safeguards, tracking and accounting controls'' they 
rely upon to ensure the proper use of IMF funds supplied to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	In demanding a review of how IMF loans to Russia were handled,  
the two also want details of when the IMF learned of the offshore 
accounts and steps taken to guard against fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia disclosed last month that from 1993 to 1998, the Russian  
Central Bank had hidden $50 billion of foreign reserves in a tax 
shelter in England's Channel Islands. Some of the money may have 
come from the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	There also were reports of large outflows of money from Russia  
to Western banks immediately after delivery of the IMF loan 
installments last summer, part of a $22.6 billion financial rescue 
package. The bailout was suspended after Russia devalued the ruble 
and defaulted on its foreign debts.

<HEADLINE> Ivy League Admissions Rate Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- So many students have been admitted  
early to the Ivy League colleges that a good part of next year's 
freshman classes already are filled. 
</P>
<P>
	Poor students who cannot attend an elite school without  
financial aid may be most affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard has admitted 72 percent of its freshmen class under an  
early action program. At Yale, the early decision program has 
brought in 41 percent of next year's class. At Columbia, 45 percent 
of the seats are gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``The frenzy picks up and students feel that they're going to be  
left out,'' said Joyce Smith, executive director of the National 
Association for College Admission Counseling in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because (early admission plans) have gotten more visibility,  
more and more parents feel that's the only way their children are 
going to get in,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Renee Gernand of the College Board in New York said guidance  
counselors, especially at highly competitive private prep schools, 
are pushing their best and brightest to apply early. 
</P>
<P>
	``All my friends are worried about if they're going to get in or  
where they're going to get in, and I'm coasting now,'' said Jeremy 
Falcone, 18, of Madison, who will attend Yale in the fall. 
``Everyone is just chewing their fingernails.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400 colleges and universities have some form of early  
application program, including many of the country's 120 
most-selective schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Students benefit because they don't have to spend their entire  
senior year fretting. And administrators are assured of having 
bright students for whom the school was their first choice, and 
they don't have to do as much recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
	Admissions officers admit that financially needy students can be  
left out in the rush. Poorer students are less likely to apply 
early because the early admissions process, in many cases, does not 
allow for comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
	Under most early decision programs -- including those at  
Dartmouth, Cornell and Yale -- students must commit to attending 
that school if they are accepted. They are held to that promise, 
regardless of the financial aid package offered. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Saleh, Cornell's dean of admissions and financial aid,  
concedes that applying early is a leap of faith for needy students. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what this comes down to may be two different decisions  
the students and the parents have to make: How strongly do they 
feel that this is the best place to be, and the degree that they 
trust that the institution will offer a reasonable financial aid 
package?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivy League administrators stress that academic standards are the  
same whenever the application is made and that personal finances 
play no role in whether a student is accepted. They aim to provide 
an aid package -- typically a combination of loans, grants and 
work-study -- that meet a student's full need. 
</P>
<P>
	Margit Dahl, director of undergraduate admissions at Yale, says  
students who apply early often have college-educated parents who 
have done a lot of planning and coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are students who are that much ahead,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Supply Worries Boost Energy Prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Energy futures prices extended their gains Tuesday on the New  
York Mercantile Exchange amid fears heavy demand going into the 
peak driving season will leave gasoline supply critically short in 
some areas. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, soybeans rose sharply, while silver retreated.  
</P>
<P>
	Crude prices have risen 37 percent this month on expectations  
world oil producers are finally serious about reducing output and 
ending a supply glut. Producers are hoping to push prices above $17 
a barrel for the first time in more than a year by acting in 
concert beginning in April to cut output some 2.1 million barrels 
daily. But some analysts have cautioned widespread cheating in the 
past has kept them from reaching that goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude prices have been supported for the past few sessions,  
however, mainly on the strength in unleaded gasoline futures. A 
spare of refinery problems in the West has sharply reduced 
production there, leading to fears that supplies will be diverted 
from the New York Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline prices in northern California have surged as much as 44  
cents, the fastest increase in more than a decade, according to 
AAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for May delivery rose 36 cents to $16.80 a barrel; April  
heating oil rose 1.18 cents to 44.38 cents a gallon; April unleaded 
gasoline rose .84 cent to 52.54 cents a gallon; May natural gas 
jumped 9.7 cents to $1.980 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures moved sharply higher on the Chicago Board of  
Trade after Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the government 
is considering a significant new aid package to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman's announcement was welcome news to a market that has  
found little to cheer about. Soybean prices have been weak amid 
active harvesting of competing Brazilian crops and expectations the 
U.S. Agriculture Department will report farmers this spring plan to 
plant record acreage to soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	The chance for the government to make significant purchases of  
soybeans, soybean meal and soybean oil for donation could help buoy 
the market. The USDA already has purchased about 3 million metric 
tons of soybeans for delivery to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	May soybeans rose 5 1/2 cents to $5.01 1/2 a bushel.  
</P>
<P>
	Silver futures tumbled on the New York Mercantile Exchange as  
warehouse inventories continued to grow, signaling that a perceived 
supply shortage is easing as demand wanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver futures had jumped amid ideas consumer demand for the  
metal in jewelry and photography was on the rise, but major fund 
houses have been leaving the market as costs for borrowing the 
metal -- a sign of strong demand -- slip. 
</P>
<P>
	May silver fell 11.2 cents to $5.003 an ounce.

<HEADLINE>  Aftershocks Hamper Rescues in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAMOLI, India (AP) -- Aftershocks rattled buildings and sent  
rescue workers scampering out of damaged homes Tuesday in India's 
lower Himalayas, where a powerful earthquake killed at least 110 
people a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly half a dozen tremors disrupted searches through the ruins  
of hundreds of homes and shops demolished during Monday's 6.8 
magnitude quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten children orphaned in Chamoli huddled together in a tent set  
up for those left homeless, crying. People scooped up food and 
cosmetics littering the streets and others cremated their loved 
ones in huge funeral pyres by the Alaknanda River. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen bodies were found Tuesday as rescue workers  
and residents used power tools, shovels and their bare hands. Many 
more people are feared buried beneath the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	The earthquake ripped a large chunk of a nearby mountain,  
showering Chamoli and the Alaknanda River with boulders. About 90 
percent of houses in Chamoli, a town of 3,000 people, were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	The isolated, mountainous area is 190 miles north of New Delhi,  
India's capital, where some buildings also suffered cracks and 
damage from the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to live here, we have to die here,'' said Kanak Singh  
Dasauli, a village elder who walked many miles to Chamoli to 
request food and medicine for his hamlet, Kiruli. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people were sleeping when the quake hit Monday at 12:35  
a.m. Some 36 aftershocks have struck the region since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Helicopters surveyed access routes Tuesday to the remote  
villages. Local police chief Shridhar Pathak said 14 surrounding 
villages were believed destroyed, and many casualties were yet to 
be counted. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, reports from the rural areas pushed the toll to 110  
in Uttar Pradesh, said Dilip Kotia, a senior state government 
official. At least 61 deaths were reported in Chamoli, 34 in 
Rudraprayag, 5 in Tehri and another 10 in neighboring villages. 
</P>
<P>
	Wailing villagers began burning the bodies of their loved ones,  
with huge boulders on the bank of the Alaknanda River serving as 
platforms. The orange flames leapt into the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The river meanders through lofty hills in the Garhwal district  
of northern Uttar Pradesh, close to India's border with China. 
</P>
<P>
	Yogendra Narain, a top state official, told reporters that at  
least 345 people have been injured and 72 of them were 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	India's seismological department said Monday's quake was the  
strongest this century in the quake-prone mountains where the 
Indian subcontinent crunches into the Asian land mass. Over 2,500 
houses have been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Light tremors are expected to hit the area for another two to  
four weeks,'' meteorologist P.R. Vaidya said in New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, the Himalayan region was battered by a devastating  
earthquake that killed more than 600 people in the Garhwal hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the same area was shaken by dozens of landslides,  
including one that wiped out a camp of Hindu pilgrims, killing more 
than 250 people. 
</P>
<P>
	India's most lethal earthquake in recent times killed nearly  
10,000 people in western India in 1993. But the most powerful quake 
was in Assam in eastern India in 1950, measuring 8.5 magnitude.

<HEADLINE>  Aftershocks Hamper Rescues in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAMOLI, India (AP) -- Aftershocks rattled buildings and sent  
rescue workers scampering out of damaged homes Tuesday in India's 
lower Himalayas, where a powerful earthquake killed at least 110 
people a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly half a dozen tremors disrupted searches through the ruins  
of hundreds of homes and shops demolished during Monday's 6.8 
magnitude quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten children orphaned in Chamoli huddled together in a tent set  
up for those left homeless, crying. People scooped up food and 
cosmetics littering the streets and others cremated their loved 
ones in huge funeral pyres by the Alaknanda River. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen bodies were found Tuesday as rescue workers  
and residents used power tools, shovels and their bare hands. Many 
more people are feared buried beneath the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	The earthquake ripped a large chunk of a nearby mountain,  
showering Chamoli and the Alaknanda River with boulders. About 90 
percent of houses in Chamoli, a town of 3,000 people, were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	The isolated, mountainous area is 190 miles north of New Delhi,  
India's capital, where some buildings also suffered cracks and 
damage from the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to live here, we have to die here,'' said Kanak Singh  
Dasauli, a village elder who walked many miles to Chamoli to 
request food and medicine for his hamlet, Kiruli. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people were sleeping when the quake hit Monday at 12:35  
a.m. Some 36 aftershocks have struck the region since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Helicopters surveyed access routes Tuesday to the remote  
villages. Local police chief Shridhar Pathak said 14 surrounding 
villages were believed destroyed, and many casualties were yet to 
be counted. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, reports from the rural areas pushed the toll to 110  
in Uttar Pradesh, said Dilip Kotia, a senior state government 
official. At least 61 deaths were reported in Chamoli, 34 in 
Rudraprayag, 5 in Tehri and another 10 in neighboring villages. 
</P>
<P>
	Wailing villagers began burning the bodies of their loved ones,  
with huge boulders on the bank of the Alaknanda River serving as 
platforms. The orange flames leapt into the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The river meanders through lofty hills in the Garhwal district  
of northern Uttar Pradesh, close to India's border with China. 
</P>
<P>
	Yogendra Narain, a top state official, told reporters that at  
least 345 people have been injured and 72 of them were 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	India's seismological department said Monday's quake was the  
strongest this century in the quake-prone mountains where the 
Indian subcontinent crunches into the Asian land mass. Over 2,500 
houses have been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Light tremors are expected to hit the area for another two to  
four weeks,'' meteorologist P.R. Vaidya said in New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, the Himalayan region was battered by a devastating  
earthquake that killed more than 600 people in the Garhwal hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the same area was shaken by dozens of landslides,  
including one that wiped out a camp of Hindu pilgrims, killing more 
than 250 people. 
</P>
<P>
	India's most lethal earthquake in recent times killed nearly  
10,000 people in western India in 1993. But the most powerful quake 
was in Assam in eastern India in 1950, measuring 8.5 magnitude.

<HEADLINE> Grant Guilty in Child Support Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Actor Rodney A. Grant has pleaded guilty to  
failing to pay child support. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, who played Wind in His Hair in the 1990 film ``Dances  
With Wolves,'' was indicted in January for failing to pay child 
support to Christina Mesa, the mother of his three teen-age 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old actor, who lives in Clovis, Calif., was indicted  
under federal child-support legislation signed into law by 
President Clinton last year. He pleaded guilty Monday, U.S. 
Attorney Tom Monaghan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment said that Grant had made only one child support  
payment since August 1992, despite earning more than $685,000 from 
1992 through 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant is scheduled to be sentenced in federal court on June 21.  
He could get two years in prison and a fine of $250,000. He also 
will be ordered to pay the past-due child support, Monaghan said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally higher  
Tuesday on the back of a record overnight rally on Wall Street, but 
shares slumped in Tokyo because of concerns over Japan's faltering 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 149.72 points,  
or 0.94 percent, to close at 15,859.12 points. On Monday, the index 
slipped 8.15 points, or 0.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei had gained some 175 points earlier Tuesday after the  
Dow gained 184.54 points to close at a record high of 10,006.78 on 
Monday. But selling set in after two reports showed Japan's economy 
remains weak. 
</P>
<P>
	The Management and Coordination Agency said Japan's unemployment  
rate surged to a new record high of 4.6 percent in February, up 0.2 
percentage point from the previous record in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the agency said spending by Japanese workers fell  
4.1 percent in February from the same month last year, the largest 
year-on-year drop in 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 120.00 yen in late  
afternoon, down 0.04 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below 
its level of 120.13 yen in New York overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong surged in reaction to sharp gains on  
Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 251.74 points, or 2.4 percent, to close at 
10,940.21. On Monday, the index had slumped 114.84 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said the weakness of the Tokyo market had little impact  
on Hong Kong shares. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean shares also closed sharply higher on aggressive  
local buying encouraged by the record rally on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seoul Stock Exchange's Korea Composite Stock Price Index  
rose 16.98 points, or 2.8 percent, to 618.05. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed flat as many investors stayed  
sidelined ahead of month-end account settlement. The key Weighted 
Stock Price Index slipped 3.02 points, or 0.04 percent, to 
6,898.66. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly higher. The  
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 8.58 points, or 0.4 percent, 
to 2,126.06. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine share prices closed higher on  
bargain-hunting. The 30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index 
(PSE Index) rose 2.76 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,012.02. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian share market finished at its  
second-highest closing level. The All Ordinaries Index rose 21.3 
points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,995.3, just shy of the record 2,996.6 
set last week. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed lower, with the  
benchmark index falling below the 500-point support level as 
foreign funds bailed out ahead of the release of the central bank's 
1998 economic report on Wednesday. The Composite Index slipped 1.59 
points to 498.57. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed higher, sparked by institutional  
buying of blue chips, dealers said. The Straits Times Index rose 
20.58 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,518.08. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian share prices closed mixed. The Composite  
Index edged up 0.763 point to 393.625. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai stock prices closed slightly lower as the  
government's economic stimulus package failed to create much 
optimism among equity investors. Thailand's cabinet voted Tuesday 
to cut the value-added tax to 7 percent from 10 percent, effective 
April 1. The SET index lost 3.56 points, or 0.9 percent, to 359.76.

	Coke Leads Dow Down  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blaming worldwide economic problems, Coke  
projected a 1 percent to 2 percent first-quarter decline in case 
volume. The company usually meets annual growth targets of 7 
percent to 8 percent. Coke was down 1 1/2 today at 63 5/16. The losses 
were minimized by a strong performance in technology shares, 
especially Internet-related stocks. AOL was up 12 1/4 at 144 5/8 on the 
Big Board. Dow member IBM was up 11/16 at 178 9/16. Oil stocks 
eased with crude prices, pushing Dow component Exxon down 1 7/8 to 
71 1/8. But lower oil prices pushed up airline stocks. US Airways 
Group climbed 4 3/8 to 50 7/8, after the airline said it would meet 
analysts' first-quarter estimates of 46 cents a share.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average retreated from

gains, but Coca-Cola dropped sharply on a disappointing sales 
forecast. The Dow closed at 9,913.26, down 93.52, having trimmed an 
earlier 132-point loss. The 103-year blue-chip index was taking a 
breather after yesterday's session, when it made its first close 
above 10,000, rising 184.54 to 10,006.78. Despite strength in tech 
stocks, broader measures were also lower. The Nasdaq composite

	Jury Awards $81M in Tobacco Lawsuit

	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A jury ordered a cigarette maker today to  
pay a record $81 million to the family of a man who died of lung 
cancer after smoking Marlboros for four decades. It was the biggest 
verdict ever won by an individual in a smoking liability case. The 
court victory by the wife and children of Jesse Williams, who died 
in 1997, was the second major hit against Philip Morris this year. 
A San Francisco jury awarded $51.5 million last month to a Marlboro

	Fed Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve policy-makers left short-term  
interest rates unchanged today, resisting the temptation to ruin 
Wall Street's celebration of the first five-digit close of the Dow 
Jones stock average. The central bank's monetary policy panel -- the 
Federal Open Market Committee -- ended a closed-door meeting by 
signaling it had left the benchmark rate on overnight loans between 
banks at 4.75 percent. It has been at that level, a four-year low, 
since Nov. 17.

	Consumer Confidence Rises Again

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The stock market's record performance and a  
strong U.S. job market sent consumer confidence higher for a 
fifth-straight month in March. But fewer people in the United 
States see conditions getting even better. The Conference Board 
reported today that its index of consumer confidence rose a 
stronger-than-expected 0.8 point to 133.9 in March from a revised 
133.1 in February. The index dropped sharply in October and has 
since been making a steady recovery. Consumer sentiment is an 
important economic indicator because consumer spending accounts for 
two-thirds of the nation's overall economic activity.

Seibert to lead its new Internet division as the company gears up

Viacom Inc., created the MTV Networks Online unit a month ago in 
order to pool together the successful Web sites for MTV, VH1 and 
Nickelodeon and to create new sites aimed at luring in music lovers 
and children. Two of the new projects in the works call for 
creating a Web site especially for kids, including moderated chat 
rooms and an online toy store; and a music destination with a 
customizable online radio feature, concert information and music 
reviews.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A digital fingerprint used by Microsoft's Office  
programs could lead investigators to the author of the rapidly 
spreading e-mail computer virus known as ``Melissa,'' a computer 
software expert said today. Melissa showed up Friday and spread 
rapidly around the world yesterday like a malicious chain letter, 
forcing affected computers to fire off dozens of infected messages 
to friends and colleagues and swamping e-mail systems. Richard 
Smith, president of Phar Lap Software, said he thinks a virus 
writer who uses the handle ``VicodinES'' wrote Melissa and 
distributed it Friday using an account stolen from America Online 
15 months ago.

	GM Plant Plans May Be Delayed  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Union opposition likely will delay and could  
significantly alter General Motors' plans to build less 
labor-intensive assembly plants, GM's president acknowledged today. 
G. Richard Wagoner Jr. said GM's April deadline to begin 
construction of the so-called ``modular'' assembly plants may have 
been unrealistic. But he also said that discussions with the United 
Auto Workers on the issue have been productive. GM wants to replace 
its aging small-car plants in Lansing, Mich., and Lordstown, Ohio, 
with the new type of plant in which parts suppliers have a larger 
role in assembling the cars. Such plants already are in operation 
overseas.

	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan received a double dose of bad news today,  
with new figures that show the country's unemployment rate soaring 
and worker spending posting its largest decline in nearly a year. 
The glum statistics dampened optimism that the world's 
second-largest economy was poised to recover anytime soon from its 
deepest recession in five decades. Unemployment hit a record high 
4.6 percent in February, and spending by wage earners declined by 
more than 4 percent during the same month.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks have optioned  
20-year-old South Korean pitcher Byung-Hyun Kim to Double-A El Paso 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks are extremely impressed with the sidearm  
right-hander's ability but say he needs seasoning in the minors 
before he's ready for the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very impressive in his two workouts here, but he needs  
to work on everything -- the language, our signs, everything. The 
National League is not the place to learn that,'' general manager 
Joe Garagiola said. 
</P>
<P>
	At El Paso, Kim will join the three young standout pitchers the  
Diamondbacks are grooming as their rotation of the future -- Brad 
Penny, John Patterson and Nick Bierbrodt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be careful,'' manager Buck Showalter said of  
Kim. ``But he's obviously a guy we think can pitch in the big 
leagues at some point in his career.''

<HEADLINE> Yankees Send Holmes to Arizona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The New York Yankees traded right-handed  
reliever Darren Holmes and about $1 million to the Arizona 
Diamondbacks on Tuesday for pitcher Ben Ford and minor league 
catcher Izzy Molina. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade will save the Yankees $527,000 in luxury tax and  
reduce their major league-high payroll to about $85 million. 
Holmes, in the second season of a $4.65 million, three-year 
contract, gets $1.4 million this season and $1.85 million next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the $3.45 million remaining in the contract, which includes a  
$2.2 million team option for 2001 with a $200,000 buyout, the 
Yankees will pay about $1 million, according to a baseball official 
who spoke on the condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes was the second reliever acquired by Arizona on Tuesday.  
Earlier in the day, the team traded pitcher Clint Sodowsky to the 
St. Louis Cardinals for right-hander John Frascatore. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were in a group of four or five that we were really  
actively talking about,'' Arizona general manager Joe Garagiola Jr. 
said, ``and I'm really happy these are the two we would come out of 
this with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes, 32, was 0-3 with New York last season with a 3.33 ERA.  
He signed with the Yankees after a successful five-year stint with 
Colorado, where he was 23-13 with 46 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sidelined from Aug. 1 to Sept. 4 last season with a lower  
back injury but came on strong after that, giving up one earned run 
in his last eight appearances, lowering his ERA from 4.05 to 3.33. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes was 1-0 with New York this spring with a 4.63 ERA in six  
appearances. He struck out nine, walked three and gave up six runs 
and 15 hits in 11 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a move I guess you can say is somewhat risky,''  
Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said in Tampa, Fla. ``I think 
Arizona gets better now because they get a guy who's going to help 
immediately. We made the move with an eye to the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York still has Ramiro Mendoza, Jeff Nelson and Dan Naulty as  
right-handers in the bullpen, and has several more right-handers at 
Triple-A Columbus, including Ryan Bradley and Todd Erdos. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition gives the Diamondbacks a reliever with  
experience as a closer in case Gregg Olson falters or is injured. 
Olson, who had 30 saves in 34 tries in a comeback season last year, 
has been bothered by a sore forearm this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can set up. He can close if he has to. He's another veteran  
right-hander,'' Garagiola said of Holmes. ``We scouted him a lot 
this spring. We've been after him for awhile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, who stands 6-foot-7 and is just 23 years old, returns to  
the organization that originally signed him as a 20th-round 
selection in the 1994 amateur draft. He was Arizona's ninth pick in 
the first round of the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, a right-hander, was 0-0 with a 9.90 ERA in eight games  
with Arizona last season. He spent the rest of the year at Triple-A 
Tucson, where he was 2-5 with a 4.35 ERA and 63 strikeouts in 68 
1-3 innings. Ford, who gets paid at a rate of $202,000 in the 
majors and $50,000 in the minors, was 1-0 this spring with an 8.38 
ERA in 9 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Molina, 27, a non-roster invitee to spring training, is expected  
to be assigned to the Yankees' Triple-A team in Columbus. He had 
spent his entire career with the Oakland Athletics organization 
prior to coming to the Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for the new relievers, the Diamondbacks placed  
right-handed reliever Aaron Small on unconditional release waivers 
and optioned left-handed reliever Brian Shouse to Tucson.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets Nigeria's Obasanjo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President-elect Olesegun Obasanjo of Nigeria  
says he is paying no heed to skeptics who argue that Nigeria's 
legacy of corruption has rendered the African nation incapable of 
sustaining democratic rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo met Tuesday with President Clinton to reaffirm his  
commitment to democracy, saying his oil-rich nation needs stable 
civilian government in order to prosper. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand and sympathize with the skeptics, but I don't go  
by the views and the thinking of the skeptics,'' Obasanjo told 
reporters. ``The success of democracy in Nigeria will signal 
success and be a catalyst to success of democracy elsewhere in West 
Africa, and indeed in Africa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Obasanjo talked for roughly a half-hour about  
establishing democratic rule in Nigeria, Africa's most populous 
nation and a country the Clinton administration considers a 
potential force for political stability on the rest of the 
continent. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton emphasized that democracy is essential if Nigeria hopes  
to experience increased investment and economic reform, said White 
House national security spokesman Mike Hammer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obasanjo was very much committed to democracy as the basic way  
for the future of Nigeria,'' Hammer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo said he assured Clinton that Nigeria will continue to  
lead a West African peacekeeping force now deployed in Sierra 
Leone, which has been wracked by civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	A retired general, Obasanjo also promised to ensure that  
Nigeria's military becomes more ``professional'' and performs its 
constitutional role. ``We will give them what they need to look 
after their welfare, but we will also keep them under the control 
of the civil'' authority, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo was Nigeria's military leader from 1976 until 1979,  
when he yielded power to a civilian government. The military took 
over again four years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo had been jailed by late Nigerian dictator Gen. Sani  
Abacha, who died last June. After Abacha died, his successor, Gen. 
Abdulasalam Abubakar, steered Nigeria toward civilian rule and 
Obasanjo was elected in February. 
</P>
<P>
	His current U.S. tour is part of an overall tour of several  
countries ahead of his May 29 inauguration. Obasanjo also met 
Tuesday with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Defense 
Secretary William Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has been invited to Obasanjo's inauguration but has not  
yet said whether he will attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo said Clinton expressed ``not just understanding, but  
also sympathy'' with Nigeria's political and economic situation. 
Nigeria has $30 billion in foreign debt. The peacekeeping force it 
leads, ECOMOG, has seen its share of U.S. assistance fall from $3.9 
million in 1998 to $1.3 million this year.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Dethrones Toys R Us </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Toys R Us Inc. reign as the nation's biggest toy  
retailer ended in 1998, with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. pulling in more 
sales than the toy superstore. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said it was the first time in more than a decade that  
Toys R Us was dethroned from the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart's sales accounted for 17.4 percent of the market in  
1998, while Toys R Us held a 16.8 percent share last year, 
according to data released Monday by The NPD Group, a Port 
Washington, N.Y.-based market research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart's market share rose from 16.3 percent, while Toys R Us  
fell from 18.3 percent in 1997. NPD does not release dollar figures 
of sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was inevitable that Wal-Mart would get to the position that  
they were ahead of Toys R Us,'' said Sean McGowan, a toy analyst at 
Gerard Klauer Mattison. ``They are building stores at a faster pace 
and using toys to build traffic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think it happened faster than most people expected,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McGowan estimated that Toys R Us had been the leading toy  
retailer for at least 15 years. NPD's database only goes back as 
far as 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The other toy retailers in the top five included: Kmart, with a  
8 percent market share; Target, with a 6.9 percent share; and KB 
Toys, with a 4.9 percent share. 
</P>
<P>
	The reign of Toys R Us as the top-selling toy retailer has  
eroded in recent years as the discount chains -- Wal-Mart, Kmart and 
Target -- began adding more toys to their selling floors and 
offering them at cheaper prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a matter of convenience for a lot of people,'' said Cliff  
Annicelli, editor of Playthings MarketWatch, a trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents don't have the luxury to just shop for toys,'' he  
said. ``It's easier to just go to Wal-Mart, where they can do the 
rest of their shopping and still get the best toys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also troubling for Toys R Us is the significant changes in the  
way children play. Kids who used to like action figures and dolls 
until they were 10 or 11 years old now want high-tech toys, beauty 
sets and sporting goods by the time they get to first grade. 
</P>
<P>
	With Toys R Us still dedicating a majority of its selling floor  
to toys, that means it's losing out on the big sales of products 
like video games and CD-ROMs. 
</P>
<P>
	Recognizing that its sales were sliding, Toys R Us last fall  
launched a reorganization plan, which included redesigning its 
stores and broadening the array of merchandise it sold. Its new 
focus includes clothing and electronics, rather than just toys. 
</P>
<P>
	The news of Toys R Us' slide in market share comes just days  
after the Paramus, N.J.-based company announced that its president 
and chief operating officer had resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the company also reported that its  
fourth-quarter earnings fell 18 percent from a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Doherty Hired as Notre Dame Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Notre Dame athletic director Mike  
Wadsworth wants the Irish in the Final Four. And he reportedly has 
hired someone who's been there. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas assistant Matt Doherty, who played with Michael Jordan  
when North Carolina won the 1982 NCAA title, is the new coach of 
the Irish, Fox Sports Net and television station WNDU said Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The school scheduled a 4 p.m. EST news conference today to  
announce its coach but declined to say who it is. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas spokesman Dean Buchan wouldn't confirm Doherty's hiring,  
but he said the assistant interviewed with Notre Dame recently and 
was not in Lawrence, Kan., today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Matt is a guy that's been qualified and ready to be a Division  
I head coach for several years,'' Buchan said. ``He has turned down 
other jobs and been approached many times about head coaching jobs, 
and he has waited for the right opportunity. Notre Dame was just a 
perfect opportunity, a perfect match for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doherty, an excellent recruiter, inherits a program that had  
only three winning seasons during its eight years with John 
MacLeod, who resigned under pressure March 9. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish, whose only appearance in the Final Four was in 1978,  
finished this season with a 14-16 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Doherty, 37, played on the 1982 North Carolina team with Jordan,  
James Worthy and Sam Perkins. He had been recruited by then-Tar 
Heels assistant Roy Williams, now the Kansas coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8 forward was also part of the 1981 team that lost to  
Indiana in the national championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah coach Rick Majerus was considered the top candidate to take  
the Irish job, but he dropped out last week amid reports school 
administrators felt he didn't fit Notre Dame's image. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzaga coach Dan Monson was a candidate but was turned down by  
Notre Dame. Xavier coach Skip Prosser, like Monson, met with Notre 
Dame officials over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Doherty's name didn't surface in the search until last weekend,  
after Notre Dame interviewed Delaware's Mike Brey, Siena's Paul 
Hewitt and Princeton's Bill Carmody. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing that undoubtedly attracted Notre Dame to Doherty was  
the eight McDonald's All-Americans that Doherty helped sign during 
his seven seasons at Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish have six scholarships available, though two are  
committed to recruits Mike Monserez of Cincinnati and Matt Carroll 
of suburban Philadelphia, considered one of the nation's top 30 
recruits. 
</P>
<P>
	They are to form a solid nucleus with Big East rookie of the  
year Troy Murphy, along with fellow freshmen David Graves and 
Harold Swanagan, both starters this season. But there's a big 
drop-off in talent after the three freshmen and sophomore point 
guard Martin Ingelsby. 
</P>
<P>
	Doherty graduated from North Carolina in 1984 and then worked as  
a government bond salesmen in New York. He later was a part-time 
radio analyst for Davidson basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Doherty was hired as an assistant at Davidson before the 1989-90  
season. He worked there three years before going to Kansas to coach 
under Williams.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen Wednesday morning  
on buying from Japanese investors on the last day of the fiscal 
year. Japanese stocks fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.90 yen in late morning, up 0.90 yen from  
late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its level of 120.36 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average shed 163.09 points, or 1.03 percent, to  
15,696.03 points at the end of the morning session. On Tuesday, the 
index lost 149.72 points, or 0.94 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was supported by buying interest among Japanese banks  
and other companies before their fiscal year book-closing on 
Wednesday, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations of large dollar demand from Japanese investors  
seeking to reinvest funds in the United States in the upcoming 
fiscal year were also helping the U.S. currency, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's new fiscal year begins on April 1.  
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 129.24 yen, up from  
128.78 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices were marginally higher early in the  
morning following weakness in Nikkei futures and losses on Wall 
Street earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	But later morning profit-taking reversed the course in slow  
trading, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the Nikkei having risen about 1,500 or 1,600 points  
recently, I guess there is nothing you can do about a fall,'' said 
Setsuo Nagao, a manager at the equity division at Tokyo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 93.52 points  
to close at 9,913.26 Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 8.81 points, or 0.69 percent, to 1,260.43. 
The TOPIX had risen 0.57 points, or 0.04 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.715  
percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.740 percent, driving its price 
up to 100.73 yen from 100.51 yen.

	NATO Launches Relentless Attack  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO answered Yugoslav leader  
Slobodan Milosevic's proposal to return to the bargaining table 
with a relentless air assault aimed at wrecking his military. 
Several missiles hit southeast of the Kosovo capital of Pristina at 
about 1 a.m. on Wednesday, and other impacts were reported around 
the province, the state-run news agency Tanjug said. Milosevic had 
indicated that he was willing to rein in the campaign against 
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and resume peace talks if the NATO 
strikes stopped. NATO leaders rejected the proposal, and President 
Clinton warned that atrocities in Kosovo would weaken Serbia's 
claim to the province. 

</P>
<P>
	Refugees Flock to Albania  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo Albanians kept up their  
exodus by foot, car and cart today, pouring across the border and 
overwhelming Albania, one of the world's poorest countries. NATO 
officials said the number of ethnic Albanians who have fled Kosovo 
in the last six days has grown to 118,000, and Pec, a city of 
100,000 in western Kosovo, has been ``almost totally destroyed.'' 
Also, a KLA leader told German television that the Serbs had 
created three concentration camps -- claims that couldn't 
immediately be confirmed. 

</P>
<P>
	Cruise Missile Supply Dwindling  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is scrambling to avoid a shortage  
of cruise missiles, the weapon used against heavily defended 
targets in places like Iraq and Yugoslavia. Before the NATO strikes 
over Kosovo and Serbia, the Air Force was down to 150 cruise 
missiles carrying conventional warheads. At least 30 have been 
launched since then. The Navy has more than 2,000 but is using them 
up at a faster rate. The dwindling supply is ``something we do 
worry about,'' a Pentagon spokesman said. 

</P>
<P>
	Conviction Reinstated in Gun Case  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People accused in multistate crime sprees can  
be prosecuted in any of those states for using a gun even if they 
had or used the gun in only one state, the Supreme Court ruled 
today. The decision reinstated the federal gun conviction of a man 
also convicted of kidnapping and conspiracy for crimes stemming 
from a 1994 drug deal gone bad. At issue was a federal law making 
it a crime to use or carry a gun ``during and in relation to any 
crime of violence.'' Conviction on the gun charge means an extra 
five years in prison.

	Jury Awards $81M in Tobacco Lawsuit  
</P>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- In the biggest liability verdict ever  
against the tobacco industry, a jury ordered Philip Morris to pay 
$81 million to the family of a man who died of lung cancer after 
smoking Marlboros for four decades. Although no smoking liability 
verdict has survived on appeal, Wall Street analysts had been 
watching this case closely to see if huge damage awards against Big 
Tobacco were now a trend. A San Francisco jury awarded $51.5 
million last month to a Marlboro smoker who has inoperable lung 
cancer.

	UN: Investment Recommended in Iraq  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council should consider  
letting foreign companies invest in Iraq's oil industry so more 
proceeds can go to buying food and medicine for needy Iraqi 
civilians, a U.N. panel recommended today. Iraq should also be 
allowed to export more oil to help finance humanitarian programs -- 
provided the revenues continue to be funneled through the United 
Nations, the panel said. But the panel did not call for a lifting 
of the oil embargo imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. The 
United Nations established the panel in February after coming under 
pressure to better provide for Iraqis.

	FCC Not Too Worried About Y2K Woes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Year 2000 computer bug probably won't  
cause major telephone or television glitches, but people still 
should limit their use of phones and computer modems on Jan. 1, 
according to a new FCC report. As for emergency calls to 911, FCC 
Commissioner Michael Powell said ``nothing we have seen yet 
suggests widespread problems.'' The report suggests that people 
have at least one telephone -- such as a cellular phone -- that 
doesn't require electricity.

15,870.61 in early trading on Wednesday. In New York on Tuesday, 
the Dow industrials fell 93.52 to 9,913.26 as financial markets

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Grant Hill scored 28 points and Lindsey Hunter

93-77 over the Atlanta Hawks tonight. The Pistons went ahead to 
stay when Hill converted a three-point play with 7:38 left in the 
third period for a 48-46 lead. The loss snapped a five-game winning

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 52.17; Nasdaq Up 10.39 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average retreated from  
10,000 today as Coca-Cola warned that its first-quarter results 
would be disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon, the Dow stood at 9,954.61, down 52.17. On Monday, the  
103-year-old blue-chip index made its first close above 10,000, 
rising 184.54 to 10,006.78. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed today, with the Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index down 2.25 at 1,307.92 and the Nasdaq composite 
index up 10.39 at 2,503.23, primarily on strength in 
computer-related shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was pulled lower by Coca-Cola, which announced late  
Monday that its world-wide soft-drink sales declined in the first 
quarter. Blaming economic problems in Asia, Russia, South Africa, 
Germany and parts of eastern Europe and Latin America, Coke 
projected a 1 percent to 2 percent first-quarter decline in case 
volume, which is how the soft drink industry measures shipments. 
The company usually meets annual growth targets of 7 percent to 8 
percent. Coke was down 2 today at 62 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dow has some Coke flatness to it,'' said William Meehan,  
market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, had Coke made its announcement earlier on Monday, it  
would have been enough to prevent the Dow average from closing 
above 10,000. At 4 p.m. Monday, Coke shares were up 1 7/8 at 67 3/8. 
After the announcement, it gave that gain back in after-hours 
trading and ended the day down 1/2. The total loss Monday of 2 3/8 is 
the equivalent of more than 10 points on the Dow, or enough to have 
left the blue-chip index below 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer-related shares were higher. IBM was up 2 15/16 at 180  
13/16, and AOL was up 13 1/2 at 145 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered  
advancers by a 5-to-4 margin. Volume came to 332.01 million shares, 
down from Monday's volume of 335.48 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market was higher despite nervousness about whether the  
Federal Reserve would decide to raise interest rates at its policy 
meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
	``While nobody expects the Fed to raise rates, there is some  
debate going on about whether they'll change the bias to 
tightening,'' Meehan said, pointing out that the strength in the 
stock market might make Fed governors more inclined toward raising 
interest rates in an effort to slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year Treasury bond was up 11/16 point, pushing its yield  
down to 5.61 percent from 5.64 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Conference Board reported its index of consumer  
confidence rose a stronger-than-expected 0.8 point in March. A 
strong economy and record stock market performance pumped it up for 
a fifth-straight month, and the Conference Board said there are no 
signs of erosion any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.94 percent. In  
afternoon trading, In Europe, the markets were mixed after the 
European Commission cut its forecast for economic growth this year 
by almost a half percentage point to 2.2 percent. Germany's DAX 
index was down 0.41 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.31 
percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.26 percent.

<HEADLINE> Renault To Sell Under Nissan Brand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Renault, the French automaker that fled the U.S.  
market a decade ago with a reputation for poor-quality cars, plans 
to return by selling its cars under the Nissan brand name early in 
the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault also plans to build cars at Nissan's plants in Mexico  
and return to that market under its own banner. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosures Tuesday provide examples of how the companies  
plan to make their new alliance work. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan and Renault will combine their design, purchasing,  
manufacturing, and sales operations around the world. The goal is 
to capitalize on what the other does best. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault, which bought a 37 percent stake in the Japanese  
automaker last weekend, also announced a strategy for reducing 
Nissan's crippling debt levels by almost 70 percent within three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Nissan story could be a turnaround story in the same way,  
in the past, Renault has been a turnaround story,'' Louis 
Schweitzer, chairman and chief executive of Renault, told reporters 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few years ago, Renault was losing money and faced with  
too much capacity and a bloated cost structure. When it last 
competed in the American market, its lineup not only included the 
Medallion sedan and the subcompact Alliance but also the venerable 
Jeep brand it acquired in the takeover of American Motors and later 
sold to Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	As a first step, the French automaker will send a team of  
between 20 to 40 executives to Nissan, including Carlos Ghosn, 
nicknamed ``Le Cost Killer'' because of his ruthless pursuit of 
savings at Renault. 
</P>
<P>
	With Ghosn scheduled to be in place July 1, Nissan expects to  
speed up its cost-cutting program, perhaps closing plants and 
paring weak auto parts suppliers from its roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``On a worldwide basis, there may be the possibility of (plant)  
closure in the future,'' Yoshikazu Hanawa, president and chief 
executive of Nissan, said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies expect to save $568 million next year by combining  
their operations, but 86 percent of that savings is expected to 
come from squeezing suppliers, the executives told analysts 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as badly as Nissan needs to cut costs, the company also  
needs to improve its sales of cars and trucks. Nissan, which builds 
the Altima sedan and Infiniti Q45 luxury car, saw its U.S. sales 
fall 14.7 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault, which is still a largely confined to Europe, also needs  
to expand sales of its Scenic micro-minivan and its Megane sedan. 
</P>
<P>
	So, the two companies plan to build and sell each other's cars.  
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer said Renault had no plans to use Nissan's assembly  
plants in Tennessee, but he said, ``You may find a product (in the 
United States) that looks like a Renault, but they would be called 
Nissans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, Renault will take over most of Nissan's operations,  
so Nissan can focus its resources on rebuilding its business in 
North America and its home market of Japan. Renault, for example, 
which doesn't build any popular sport utility vehicles may start 
selling Nissan's 4X4s under the Renault brand. 
</P>
<P>
	The first joint car will debut in 2003, as Nissan's Micra and  
Renault's Clio start rolling off the same assembly line. By 2010, 
Schweitzer plans to reduce the number of basic chassis designs to 
10 from 34 today. 
</P>
<P>
	That won't be easy. The two companies have two very different  
cultures and languages and are headquartered about 6,500 miles 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nissan and Renault are facing the same global excess  
capacity and razor-thin profit margins that drove Chrysler Corp. 
into the arms of Daimler-Benz, and forced Mazda Motor Co. to give 
up control to Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big-scale deal and it's probably of risk to both  
parties, but the potential payoff would be significant if it works 
out,'' observed President G. Richard Wagoner Jr., president of 
competing General Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest risk, of course, is Nissan's hemorrhaging debts. The  
company owes a total of $19.9 billion, and its home market of Japan 
has been mired in recession for much of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The depth of Nissan's red ink wasn't even known until this week.  
DaimlerChrysler, which earlier had discussed a partnership with 
Nissan, walked away, in part, because of Nissan's labyrinth of 
liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault's Schweitzer said, ``We have done a very complete due  
diligence on the debt issue,'' and can reduce it to $6.2 billion 
within three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the debt reduction comes from Renault's $5.4 billion  
investment. Nissan also will sell about $2.7 billion in noncore 
businesses, and cut $500 million from inventories. The two 
companies expect to save $1.7 billion in synergies over that time 
frame, and use about $3.4 billion in Nissan's earnings to pay off 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Short-term lenders have also agreed to stretch out the repayment  
by exchanging their loans for longer-term bonds.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Show McDougal TV Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- In a 1996 television interview shown by  
prosecutors at Susan McDougal's Whitewater-related contempt trial, 
she made no mention of the allegations that are now a key part of 
her testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's prosecutors showed the video  
tape Monday in an attempt to challenge McDougal's charge last week 
that she had been pressured to say she had an affair with Bill 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Mrs. McDougal's lawyer wants the jury to hear the  
account of another figure in the scandals surrounding the Clintons 
who claims she's been mistreated by Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, said he would try to call Julie  
Hiatt Steele as a defense witness. The defense and prosecution were 
expected to argue today over the admission of Ms. Steele's 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele, a defendant in a case arising from the president's  
affair with Monica Lewinsky, was charged with making false 
statements after she gave testimony that undercut the account of 
Kathleen Willey, who says Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance 
toward her. 
</P>
<P>
	Associated Independent Counsel Mark Barrett said prosecutors  
would object to any testimony from Ms. Steele as ``totally 
irrelevant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It would turn that whole area into a mini-trial,'' he said.  
``It would certainly take this trial well beyond this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her defense against criminal contempt and obstruction of  
justice charges, Mrs. McDougal has said she refused to answer 
federal grand jury questions because she feared Starr would charge 
her with perjury if she did not provide incriminating information 
about Clinton or his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal and her late ex-husband, James McDougal, were  
business partners with the Clintons in the Whitewater real estate 
venture, the initial subject of Starr's investigation. Mrs. 
McDougal was indicted on contempt and obstruction charges after she 
refused to answer the grand jury questions in September 1996 and 
again last April. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal was beginning her fifth day on the witness stand  
today, responding to questions from Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett played a videotape Monday of the ABC television  
interview of Mrs. McDougal in August 1996, after she and her 
ex-husband were convicted of fraud in the Whitewater investigation, 
along with then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowhere in the three hours or so of out-takes from the ABC  
interview did Mrs. McDougal refer to the most sensational testimony 
so far in her trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, she testified that her ex-husband asked her sometime  
before the ABC interview to tell Starr's office that she had an 
affair with Clinton as a way of helping Starr ``get'' Clinton 
before the presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	James McDougal had alleged that his former wife had an affair  
with Clinton during the 1980s. Mrs. McDougal has refused to answer 
that question. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing the videotape, Barrett got Mrs. McDougal to admit  
differences between her 1996 interview with ABC and her testimony 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	She conceded that in the TV interview she didn't mention being  
pressured by her ex-husband to say she'd had an affair with Clinton 
or that he had told her that Deputy Independent Counsel Hickman 
Ewing Jr. claimed prosecutors already had ``sex charges'' on 
Clinton that they could use before the 1996 election. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not want to talk about sex on national television,''  
Mrs. McDougal told Barrett. ``I did not bring it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett also introduced three job applications and a credit card  
application from years ago on which Mrs. McDougal admitted she 
lied. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courthouse, Geragos criticized Barrett for ``digging  
up 10-year-old employee applications.'' Geragos called Barrett's 
behavior ``one small vignette that the independent counsel can't be 
trusted.''

<HEADLINE> Economy Extends Retirement Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The healthy economy has boosted the fortunes  
of Social Security and Medicare, delaying the date when each will 
run short of money, trustees for the two retirement programs 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strength of our economy has led to modest but real  
improvements,'' President Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second consecutive year that stronger-than-expected  
economic growth has improved the outlook for the nation's 
retirement system. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly and  
disabled, had been projected to run short of cash in 2001. Last 
year that date was moved to 2008, and Tuesday's report moves it 
further to 2015. 
</P>
<P>
	The Social Security insolvency date, extended last year from  
2029 to 2032, was moved Tuesday to 2034. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Clinton and Republicans in Congress both said they will  
continue to press for changes to strengthen the retirement system 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now is the time to make those changes -- now when our economy  
is strong; now when our people have renewed confidence; and now, 
when we have time on our side so that modest changes today can have 
major impacts in the years ahead,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., chairman of the House Ways and Means  
Social Security subcommittee, said lawmakers ``must not lose focus 
or become complacent. The longer we delay true reform, the more 
difficult it will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, however, there is little agreement about what to do.  
</P>
<P>
	Some experts speculate that the latest good news could reduce  
pressure on lawmakers to make dramatic changes, and risk political 
backlash, before the 2000 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might give some impetus to the concept of a slower  
transition,'' said public policy researcher Marilyn Moon, one of 
two private citizens on the board of trustees for the retirement 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The other trustees consist of Clinton administration officials,  
including Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the strength of the economy, the trustees  
attributed the latest improvement in Medicare to cost-cutting 
agreed to by lawmakers in 1997 and to a crackdown on waste, fraud 
and abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't get here just by riding a very strong economy. It  
took very sound management,'' Shalala said. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, Social Security's finances have benefited from recent  
refinement of the Consumer Price Index, used by the government to 
calculate yearly cost-of-living raises that retirees get. Experts 
believe the CPI previously overstated inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Stronger economic growth has helped Medicare and Social Security  
by holding unemployment near a 29-year low. Because more Americans 
are working, taxes deducted from workers' paychecks to support the 
programs have risen. 
</P>
<P>
	Low inflation also saves both programs money because yearly  
Social Security cost-of-living raises to retirees were smaller, and 
health care costs remained lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security, the largest federal benefit program, sends  
checks to more than 44 million Americans. In addition to payments 
to retirees, Social Security also pay disabled people and survivors 
of workers who die young. 
</P>
<P>
	Because most members of the huge baby boom generation -- people  
born from 1946 through 1964 -- are still working, Social Security 
now collects more payroll taxes than are needed to pay benefits to 
today's retirees. The surpluses are invested in government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will not need to start cashing in those investments  
until 2014, a year later than estimated last year, trustees said. 
At that time, baby boomers will have begun retiring, and it is 
projected that taxes paid by those left in the work force won't 
cover baby boomers' benefits. Social Security's reserves will be 
exhausted by 2034, and incoming payroll taxes will pay only 71 
percent of retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare, which provides health coverage for 39 million elderly  
and disabled Americans, already has had to spend money from its 
trust fund, which covers mostly hospitalizations. However, last 
year the program's income from payroll taxes exceeded spending on 
benefits for the first time since 1994. The trust fund reaped a 
$4.8 billion windfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Medicare benefits, such as doctors' office visits, are  
financed through income taxes and beneficiaries' monthly premium 
payments.

<HEADLINE> Hajj Pilgrims Head Back Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MECCA, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Hundreds of buses and cars streamed  
out of Mecca today, packed with Muslim pilgrims headed home after 
performing what for many was a once-in-lifetime journey of faith. 
</P>
<P>
	After living in spartan conditions for the past week, the devout  
traveled to the Red Sea port city of Jiddah to catch flights back 
home or to Medina, the second holiest city in Islam after Mecca. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God, I completed the pilgrimage. I hope I live long  
enough to come back here again,'' Adullah al-Shamari, 65, of 
Kuwait, said after leaving Mecca's Grand Mosque, where he circled 
the Kaaba, the large cubic stone structure covered in black cloth 
that is Islam's most sacred site. 
</P>
<P>
	Going around the Kaaba is an essential ritual of the annual  
pilgrimage, or hajj, which all able-bodied Muslims are required to 
perform at least once in their lifetime if they can afford it. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Shamari, his head shaved in a tradition dating back to the  
prophet Mohammed's pilgrimage 1,400 years ago, exchanged 
congratulations with friends and relatives as they left the Grand 
Mosque. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost everyone who makes the pilgrimage to Mecca also visits  
Medina to pay homage at the tomb of Mohammed in the Mosque of the 
Prophet, or Masjid an-Nabi, the second most venerable place of 
worship in Islam after the Grand Mosque. 
</P>
<P>
	Other famous mosques in Medina are Masjid at-Taqwa, which stands  
on the site of Islam's first mosque; the Ghamamah, where the 
Prophet prayed for rain; and the Sabaq mosque, which was the site 
of the original festival prayers. 
</P>
<P>
	This year about 1.7 million pilgrims performed the hajj, which  
historically has been a means of bringing together the many races 
and nations that make up the 1 billion strong Muslim community. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, 2.3 million hajj pilgrims came to Saudi Arabia. The  
drop this year was attributed to economic turmoil in Southeast 
Asia, especially Indonesia, and low oil prices affecting Middle 
Eastern nations brought down the number of pilgrims. 
</P>
<P>
	The strongest representation at the hajj every year has been  
from Indonesia, which has the largest Muslim population. 
</P>
<P>
	Today the streets of Mecca were relatively free of the traffic  
chaos of the last few days. Fewer car horns were heard and crossing 
streets was easier. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday night, Mecca was awash in a celebratory mood with  
residents and pilgrims alike socializing in the streets. Stores 
stayed open late, letting pilgrims pick up some last souvenirs.

</P>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Deep-voiced jazz singer Joe Williams, who  
performed with orchestras headed by Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, 
was found dead on a Las Vegas street Monday after leaving his 
hospital bed and walking several miles. He collapsed just blocks 
from his home. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark County Coroner Ron Flud said it appeared Williams died of  
natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' wife, Jillean, said that her husband had been admitted  
to Sunrise Hospital a week earlier for a respiratory ailment after 
becoming ill in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Why Williams left the hospital wasn't immediately known.  
Longtime friend and fellow singer Buddy Greco told the 
Review-Journal he spoke with Williams on Sunday night and that the 
ill singer told him that he was seeing spirits in his hospital 
room. 
</P>
<P>
	In his teens in the 1930s, his big baritone voice led the  
singing group, The Jubilee Boys in performances in Chicago 
churches. He began singing solo at a Chicago club called Kitty 
Davis's and was earning up to $30 a night, mostly in tips, for 
singing and for cleaning up after customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams made his professional debut in 1937 with the late Jimmy  
Noone. 
</P>
<P>
	His big break came in 1943, when Williams was working as a  
security guard to support himself. He wound up guarding the front 
door of the Regal Theater and met jazz luminaries such as Duke 
Ellington. The Regal's manager sent Williams to join jazz 
percussionist Lionel Hampton's band at the Tick Tock in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in his later years, Williams sang on cruise ships, at  
festivals, in hotels and clubs, working about 40 weeks a year, 
especially in Las Vegas.

<HEADLINE> Huskies Get Huge Welcome Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Connecticut fans at the celebration of the  
Huskies' first men's national basketball title had a dual purpose 
for attending: convincing Richard Hamilton to stay for another 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton flirted with leaving before his junior year for the  
NBA. Speculation on whether he or sophomore guard Khalid El-Amin 
will return for another year has heightened during the Huskies' 
successful run and Monday's national title win over Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 10,000 at a pep rally chanted ``One more year'' for  
Hamilton, the Final Four MVP. He scored 27 points against Duke in 
the Huskies' 77-74 national title win. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim Calhoun said neither Hamilton nor El-Amin has  
approached him yet on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my job to convince them to stay. It never has and  
never will,'' he said. ``These are young people going through the 
process. It is their decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the school's winningest coach has counseled players in the  
past. Former standouts Donyell Marshall and Ray Allen sought his 
advice before coming out their junior years. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall, the top pick of the Golden State Warriors, wasn't  
ready to go, but the price was right, Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was going to be offered between $45 million and $55 million  
and the salary cap was coming the next year,'' Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, who plays for the Milwaukee Bucks, approached his coach  
twice. The first time was his sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked him if he was happy and he said `I love college,'''  
Calhoun recalled. Allen chose to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he asked me his junior year if he was ready, I said `You  
are more than ready.' He obviously made a great decision. He's 
going to be an NBA All-Star shortly,'' Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tuesday was not just about saying goodbye to Hamilton,  
El-Amin or anyone. It was Thanksgiving in Connecticut and a time 
for recognizing the top team in the land. 
</P>
<P>
	``You stood by us. You believed,'' senior point guard Ricky  
Moore told the crowd. ``We didn't let you down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A bus carrying Calhoun and his national champions traveled the  
35 miles from the airport to campus Tuesday, but it took them 
through the heart and hearts of Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorists pulled off along the highway. Families, jumping and  
waving, ran from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The journey back home was incredible,'' Calhoun said.  
</P>
<P>
	And once inside Gampel Pavilion, the team was embraced by a  
standing-room-only crowd of more than 10,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun reflected on the journey he began 13 years ago to build  
the No. 1 team. A big bump in the road was 1990's heartbreaking 
loss to Duke. A buzzer-beater by Christian Laettner kept the 
Huskies from the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``We returned to Storrs to have you mend our broken heart,''  
Calhoun said. ``Yesterday, we ... broke some hearts. 
</P>
<P>
	The title was the first for the men's team in school history and  
the first for a New England team since Holy Cross won the 
tournament in 1947. The UConn women brought home the national title 
in 1995 with a 35-0 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The team and coaches sat on a raised platform in front of the  
student section, the same section Calhoun has saluted each time he 
has walked off after a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't wait to come back home to you and bring back the  
national championship,'' Calhoun told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, at Bradley International Airport, about 2,000 fans  
cheered and screamed as the players mingled in the crowd. Leigh 
Anne Crocco of West Haven jumped frantically up and down as her 
hero, Jake Voskuhl, gave her a high-five. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bones Found in Search for Boxer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIVINGSTON, N.J. (AP) -- Federal agents searching for a missing  
former member of the Soviet national boxing team have found human 
bones in the back yard of a home. 
</P>
<P>
	The boxer, Sergei Kobozev, may have been a victim of a Russian  
mob assassination, according to news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	A bone found Monday, the fourth day of digging in the yard, was  
identified by an anthropologist as a human femur, or thigh bone, 
said FBI spokesman Joseph Valiquette. That was followed by the 
discovery of more bones, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It will take up to a couple of weeks to identify whose bones  
they are, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators began digging in the yard after receiving a tip  
from an undisclosed source that Kobozev's body was buried there. 
</P>
<P>
	Valiquette said there is no indication that the current  
residents, who have lived there for about a year, are linked to 
Kobozev's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	He wouldn't discuss any theories investigators have on why  
Kobozev may have been killed. However, news reports in New York 
City said last week that Russian mobsters killed Kobozev because he 
had thrown them out of a Brooklyn bar where he worked as a bouncer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kobozev, 31, immigrated in 1991. He vanished Nov. 8, 1995.  
</P>
<P>
	The former Soviet army captain was a chemical engineer in St.  
Petersburg but made his name on the Soviet national boxing team. 
</P>
<P>
	At 6-foot-1 and 190 pounds, he won the United States Boxing  
Association cruiserweight championship in June 1994, and had 16 
knockouts in his professional career. Cruiserweight is the category 
between heavyweight and light-heavyweight.

<HEADLINE> Golfer Duval Says He's Content  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- David Duval doesn't hitch his  
pants and go for broke. He's more likely to adjust his wraparound 
sunglasses and pitch back into the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't punch the air with a stiff uppercut whenever he makes  
a 40-foot putt. Then again, when is the last time Duval even had a 
putt that long? 
</P>
<P>
	Remember the time Hale Irwin ran around the 18th green giving  
high-fives after getting into a playoff in the 1990 U.S. Open? 
Duval hit the biggest clutch shot of his career, a wedge onto the 
island green to clinch The Players Championship, and the best he 
could offer was a low-five to his caddie. 
</P>
<P>
	Boring? Yes, but a big reason why Duval is so effective.  
</P>
<P>
	He makes no apologies for who he is and makes no effort to  
become someone he isn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just play golf,'' Duval said at the start of the year,  
before he won three times in his first eight tournaments to prolong 
the hottest streak in golf since Tom Watson was at his peak some 20 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what it feels like to win golf tournaments. I certainly  
know what it's like to lose them,'' he said. ``I guess that's why I 
don't get too high or too low because I know you're not far from 
getting beat. I think I'm content with where I am and what I'm 
doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval is at No. 1 in the world ranking, thanks to his victory  
Sunday in The Players Championship in which he took only 22 putts 
in the final round. What he is doing is simply proving once again 
that the most important piece of equipment is between the ears. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing about David is, we all know he's got every aspect of  
the game,'' Masters and British Open champion Mark O'Meara said. 
``We know he's a great driver, a good iron player. He's got a great 
short game and he's a wonderful putter. 
</P>
<P>
	``But one of his biggest assets is he's a very composed  
player,'' O'Meara said. ``He doesn't let a couple of bad breaks 
bother him, and I think that's why he's playing some of the best 
golf of anybody in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval's composure can be traced to his first two years on the  
PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	He set a record for earnings by a rookie but didn't win. He made  
the Presidents Cup team in only his second year on tour but didn't 
win. Five times he took the lead into the final round only to watch 
someone else cash the first-place check. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval never wavered from his belief that his time was coming.  
</P>
<P>
	``My goal isn't to win a golf tournament,'' he said in May 1996.  
``My goal is to win 20 of them, 30 of them, and majors. I think you 
have to learn a lot about yourself and the game, and how you play 
it, to accomplish those goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, he is accomplishing them. The next stop: a major.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval's victory Sunday was the 10th in the last 18 months, and  
he will be the prohibitive favorite in the Masters next week. The 
way Duval played last week on a Stadium Course with deep rough and 
concrete green, that first major might not be too far away. 
</P>
<P>
	During four grueling days, Duval never lost his composure on the  
course and never whined off it. He took bogeys and birdies in 
stride, never once made double bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Duval's first tournament in nearly a month. He didn't hit  
the ball as crisply as he did when he won the Hope Classic with a 
59, or when he won the Mercedes Championships by nine strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he plugged away and dazzled the hometown gallery with  
great shots and big putts, even if neither was accompanied by much 
emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval did lose his cool in the third round when a fairly simple  
bunker shot wound up 15 feet past the hole. He stomped his foot in 
the sand, handed the wedge to his caddie and that was that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't believe it serves any purpose,'' Duval said when  
asked about tantrums. ``It's over with. Go on to the next shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's time for Duval to go on to the next objective.  
</P>
<P>
	Even though he is just 27, Duval will move to the top of the  
list of best players without a major -- simply because he is the 
best player and he doesn't have one. The label became a burden for 
Davis Love III before he won the PGA Championship at age 33. It 
weighs heavily now on Phil Mickelson and Colin Montgomerie. 
</P>
<P>
	Chances are, Duval has such an even keel that he won't be  
suffocated by expectations of winning the first one. When he gets 
that first major, whether it's next week or next year, don't be 
surprised if several more follow.

<HEADLINE>  Marquette Hires Crean As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Marquette hired Michigan State assistant Tom  
Crean as men's basketball coach Tuesday, choosing a candidate who 
was an early focus of the selection committee seeking a successor 
to Mike Deane. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's on everybody's radar screen,'' athletic director Bill  
Cords said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Robert A. Wild, Marquette president, said Crean, 32,  
possesses everything the university was looking for, including 
``great recruiting ability, knowledge of the Midwest, successful 
coaching experience, a tremendous work ethic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deane was fired after the Golden Eagles' season ended with a  
first-round loss in the Conference USA tournament. Cords said at 
the time Marquette's competitiveness had ``gradually eroded'' 
during Deane's five-year tenure, even though he led the team to 
postseason play the previous four years. His record at Marquette 
was 100-55. 
</P>
<P>
	Cords declined to say what qualities Crean brings that Deane  
didn't have. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to compare. I don't think that's fair to  
anyone,'' Cords said. ``He's from a program that set a very high 
level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crean spent the last four seasons as an assistant with the  
Spartans and has been associate head coach the last two. Michigan 
State lost to Duke in the NCAA tournament semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always believed if you've been to that level, you have  
vision,'' Cords said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crean said he brings enthusiasm and a willingness to work hard  
to his first head coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're going to see a selfless team,'' he said. ``It's  
almost the same as unselfishness but it takes it to another level, 
totally committed to your teammates, totally committed to the 
person next to you. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to create a bond here that when we walk into the  
Bradley Center, when we walk into opposing arenas, that we know the 
bond can't be broken,'' Crean said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said Crean has ``multidimensional  
strengths,'' including his recruiting ability. Crean also was 
recruiting coordinator for Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	He recruited and developed Mateen Cleaves, two-time Big Ten  
Player of the Year and a member of this season's Associated Press 
All-America team. 
</P>
<P>
	Crean said recruiting for Marquette will start at home, a method  
he called the ``inside out theory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He inherits one signed recruit, Krunti Hester of Indianapolis.  
He also has one scholarship available when the spring signing 
period begins April 7 and could have more if some players choose to 
transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Mount Pleasant, Mich., Crean was an assistant at  
Alma College, Western Kentucky and Pittsburgh before going to 
Michigan State.

<HEADLINE> Catcher Fordyce Surprises White Sox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- When the Chicago White Sox traded for Brook  
Fordyce last week, they were expecting a solid defensive catcher 
who was OK at the plate. Then this guy shows up who hits homers 
like Mike Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
	So who's the real Brook Fordyce?  
</P>
<P>
	Wait and see.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can hit. It's just I haven't had the opportunity,'' he said.  
``I don't know how good I am over 400 at-bats. I don't know what 
kind of numbers I'm going to put up. But it's not like I was an 
automatic out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fordyce, who spent the last three years with Cincinnati, served  
notice as he got off the plane Friday that there was more to his 
game than defense. Delayed when his flight had to turn around 
because of a sick passenger, he arrived late and didn't get in on 
the White Sox win against Milwaukee until the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	His one official at-bat shows he was hit by a pitch. But when  
the Brewers asked to play the bottom of the ninth so reliever Al 
Reyes could get some extra work, Fordyce homered. 
</P>
<P>
	He got his first official home run the next day against the  
Chicago Cubs, and hit two more Sunday against the Arizona 
Diamondbacks. That's one more than Frank Thomas has. 
</P>
<P>
	Granted, it's only spring training, but in three games with the  
White Sox, the career .239 hitter is hitting .571 with five RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am surprised, pleasantly surprised, he's swinging the bat  
that well,'' manager Jerry Manuel said. ``Even looking back at his 
history didn't indicate he would have had three homers in two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's Albert's number.''  
</P>
<P>
	That's Albert as in Albert Belle, the surly slugger who left  
behind his No. 8 when he signed with Baltimore in the offseason. 
Fordyce, who wore No. 6 with the Reds, chuckled when he heard 
Manuel's number theory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be that. It could be that,'' he said. ``Like I said,  
I'm just having quality at-bats and making great contact. I'm just 
relaxed and I'm seeing the ball, trying to get my at-bats in now 
and get ready for the season, because I wasn't getting them over 
with Cincinnati.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fordyce, 28, was drafted by the New York Mets in 1989, but  
didn't make it to the majors until 1995. He was on the Mets opening 
day roster, only to be placed on waivers after appearing in four 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two years, he's been a backup in Cincinnati. The  
Reds carried him on their major league roster in 1997 as a 
seldom-used third catcher because they were afraid they'd lose him 
if they tried to send him to the minors. He batted .253 with three 
homers in 57 games last season as Eddie Taubensee's backup. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the Reds decided to carry Taubensee and Brian Johnson  
as their two catchers this year, Fordyce became the odd man out. 
Enter the White Sox. The Sox brought three young catchers to spring 
training, but none was impressive enough to win the starting job. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordyce had the defensive skills the White Sox wanted -- he got  
36 percent of the runners who challenged his arm last season, and 
the Reds pitchers had a combined 3.78 ERA when he was behind the 
plate -- so the White Sox figured they could start him right away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just hearing the trade rumors, it gave me something to look  
forward to,'' he said. ``Then when it happened, I was ecstatic 
because it's a good opportunity -- a great opportunity -- for me. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to play and to play every day,'' he added. ``I  
was patient, and I got my chance, and I'm really looking forward to 
seeing what I can do over the full course of a year.''

<HEADLINE> 'Melissa' Computer Virus Mutating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Several mutations of the fast-moving computer  
virus called Melissa surfaced in cyberspace Tuesday, but 
researchers said none seems to be as effective as the original in 
clogging e-mail systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, an executive of a small software company in  
Cambridge, Mass., said he had found clues linking the virus to a 
still-unidentified writer who uses the computer handle 
``VicodinES''. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Smith, president of Phar Lap Software, a firm that makes  
operating systems and software tools, said he thinks the virus 
writer distributed it using an account stolen from America Online 
15 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa showed up Friday and spread rapidly around the world on  
Monday like a malicious chain letter, causing affected computers to 
fire off dozens of infected messages to friends and colleagues and 
swamping e-mail systems. While there have been no reports of 
permanent damage from the virus, it disrupted the operations of 
thousands of companies and government agencies whose employees were 
temporarily unable to communicate by e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus arrives to its victims disguised as an e-mail from a  
friend, with a note in the subject line saying that an important 
document is attached. 
</P>
<P>
	The attachment is a document in Microsoft's Word format that  
lists Internet pornography sites. Once the user opens that file, 
the virus digs into the user's address book and sends infected 
documents to the first 50 addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the variations that appeared Tuesday -- carrying the name  
Melissa.A -- leaves the subject line blank, a change that can foil 
electronic filters that are designed to detect and delete the 
original message, said Dan Schrader, director of product marketing 
for Trend Micro Inc., an anti-virus company in Cupertino, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Another variant, ``Papa,'' appeared Monday afternoon. It  
attaches a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet document which, when opened, 
sends out 60 e-mails, however Papa has bugs that sometimes prevent 
it from working. 
</P>
<P>
	``From our analysis we don't feel it's anywhere near the threat  
that Melissa is,'' said Steve Trilling, a director of research at 
Symantec, a maker of virus detection software. 
</P>
<P>
	A third virus, called ``Mad Cow Joke'' has also appeared,  
Schrader said, and works like Melissa, sending itself to 20 people 
in the victim's e-mail address book. 
</P>
<P>
	The danger of all the variants is that virus writers will find  
them on the Internet, correct the bugs and distribute them further. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the amateur cybersleuth who has apparently gotten close  
to finding the author, is the same man who a month ago revealed 
that the popular Microsoft Office software applications place a 
secret serial number in documents that can be used to identify a 
particular computer user. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith theorized that this ``digital fingerprint'' might be  
useful in finding the author of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith posted this theory on an Internet discussion group Friday  
and received an e-mail from a Stockholm University student, who 
pointed out similarities between the work of a known virus writer 
who used the computer name VicodinES and Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith also discovered that in December 1997, the same America  
Online account that sent out Melissa had posted a similar virus. 
Smith found digital fingerprints linking the virus writer called 
VicodinES to that virus. 
</P>
<P>
	He directed reporters to call the owner of the VicodinES Web  
site, who have since told him they may have actually talked to 
VicodinES and who described him as a teenage boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith passed his information onto the FBI, which has declined to  
comment, although it is investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
	VicodinES also is the name of a narcotic painkiller made by  
Knoll Laboratories. At company headquarters in Mount Olive, N.J., 
spokeswoman Linda Mayer said Tuesday that all she knows about 
Melissa is what she's read in newspapers.

<HEADLINE> Aftershocks Hamper Rescues in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAMOLI, India (AP) -- Aftershocks rattled buildings and sent  
rescue workers scampering out of damaged homes Tuesday in India's 
lower Himalayas, where a powerful earthquake killed at least 110 
people a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly half a dozen tremors disrupted searches through the ruins  
of hundreds of homes and shops demolished during Monday's 6.8 
magnitude quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten children orphaned in Chamoli huddled together in a tent set  
up for those left homeless, crying. People scooped up food and 
cosmetics littering the streets and others cremated their loved 
ones in huge funeral pyres by the Alaknanda River. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen bodies were found Tuesday as rescue workers  
and residents used power tools, shovels and their bare hands. Many 
more people are feared buried beneath the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	The earthquake ripped a large chunk of a nearby mountain,  
showering Chamoli and the Alaknanda River with boulders. About 90 
percent of houses in Chamoli, a town of 3,000 people, were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	The isolated, mountainous area is 190 miles north of New Delhi,  
India's capital, where some buildings also suffered cracks and 
damage from the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to live here, we have to die here,'' said Kanak Singh  
Dasauli, a village elder who walked many miles to Chamoli to 
request food and medicine for his hamlet, Kiruli. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people were sleeping when the quake hit Monday at 12:35  
a.m. Some 36 aftershocks have struck the region since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Helicopters surveyed access routes Tuesday to the remote  
villages. Local police chief Shridhar Pathak said 14 surrounding 
villages were believed destroyed, and many casualties were yet to 
be counted. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, reports from the rural areas pushed the toll to 110  
in Uttar Pradesh, said Dilip Kotia, a senior state government 
official. At least 61 deaths were reported in Chamoli, 34 in 
Rudraprayag, 5 in Tehri and another 10 in neighboring villages. 
</P>
<P>
	Wailing villagers began burning the bodies of their loved ones,  
with huge boulders on the bank of the Alaknanda River serving as 
platforms. The orange flames leapt into the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The river meanders through lofty hills in the Garhwal district  
of northern Uttar Pradesh, close to India's border with China. 
</P>
<P>
	Yogendra Narain, a top state official, told reporters that at  
least 345 people have been injured and 72 of them were 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	India's seismological department said Monday's quake was the  
strongest this century in the quake-prone mountains where the 
Indian subcontinent crunches into the Asian land mass. Over 2,500 
houses have been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Light tremors are expected to hit the area for another two to  
four weeks,'' meteorologist P.R. Vaidya said in New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, the Himalayan region was battered by a devastating  
earthquake that killed more than 600 people in the Garhwal hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the same area was shaken by dozens of landslides,  
including one that wiped out a camp of Hindu pilgrims, killing more 
than 250 people. 
</P>
<P>
	India's most lethal earthquake in recent times killed nearly  
10,000 people in western India in 1993. But the most powerful quake 
was in Assam in eastern India in 1950, measuring 8.5 magnitude.

<HEADLINE> Republican Kasich Hunts for Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- John Kasich likens his White House campaign  
to climbing Mount Everest, and he knows money is the oxygen he 
needs to reach the summit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe the second time, when I run for re-election, I won't  
need the oxygen,'' he says. ``But this time I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Politicians and strategists say a candidate needs to raise $20  
million by the end of this year to properly finance a campaign in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican congressman from Ohio is hunting for that money  
this week in California, a state with the richest fund-raising 
atmosphere in the nation, but also one where his own party recently 
snubbed him by not inviting him to its annual convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Few people here know him.  
</P>
<P>
	``Who is that?'' Mike Garner of Danville asked as Kasich left a  
restaurant. Neither the face nor the name rang any bells, Garner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll released last week showed just 4 percent of California  
Republicans favored him over his GOP rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kasich believes he can connect with California, which is  
holding its primary earlier than ever this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Californians like the underdog, they like `against the grain.'  
I'm clearly both,'' he said in an interview Tuesday over a 
breakfast of eggs and bacon. 
</P>
<P>
	There is plenty about the telegenic congressman that could  
appeal to Californians. He is young, 46, self-confident and 
straightforward. 
</P>
<P>
	Walking through the bowels of telecommunications giant Nortel  
Networks in the Silicon Valley on Monday, Kasich quickly grew 
impatient as product manager Kelly A. Small demonstrated a bank of 
troubleshooting computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich interrupted him mid-sentence, demanding: ``How old are  
you?'' ``I'm 40 years old,'' Small responded. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich interrogated Small on how he was trained, where he went  
to high school, what he studied at his two-year college, whether he 
thought he paid too much in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	After the grilling, Kasich thanked Small and began to walk away,  
then returned to invite himself to Small's house. ``You get your 
friends, and I come in and talk for about an hour about what I'm 
all about,'' he said. Small paused briefly, then agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	So what is Kasich about?  
</P>
<P>
	He preaches the need to reinforce families, religion and  
volunteerism. Most of all, he rails against the ``the elites'' and 
says the government should ``keep its mitts off'' citizens and 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Few people in California know that as the House Budget Committee  
chairman, he is a very powerful member of that government. Kasich 
rarely brought that fact up in public this week, except indirectly, 
when he claimed credit for balancing the federal budget or promoted 
his proposed tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich has spent most of his adult life in government work, but  
he insists he's no Beltway insider, reminding listeners that he's 
the son of a mail carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am of the people,'' he says. ``My dad couldn't get me on the  
Little League team, let alone in the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For all his brash words, Kasich knows that climbing to the White  
House nearly impossible, a fact he acknowledges as he begs Los 
Angeles, Silicon Valley and San Francisco entrepreneurs for ``the 
O's'' -- financial oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people don't give me the Os, I'll die on the mountain,'' he  
says.

<HEADLINE> Tom Crean May Coach Marquette </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Tom Crean, an assistant coach at Michigan  
State, will be Marquette's new head coach, according to the 
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Crean would replace Mike Deane, who was fired  
March 5, two days after the Golden Eagles ended their season with a 
first-round loss in the Conference USA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The school said only that a news conference was scheduled today  
concerning a new coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Crean has been an assistant at Alma College, Western Kentucky  
and Pittsburgh before going to Michigan State in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Marquette was 14-15 last season, the first losing season under  
Deane, whose overall record with the Golden Eagles was 100-55. 
</P>
<P>
	Marquette spokesman Josh Sutter said this morning a time for the  
news conference on the matter had not been set, but the Journal 
Sentinel reported one would be held this afternoon.

<HEADLINE>  Marquette Hires Crean As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Marquette hired Michigan State assistant Tom  
Crean as men's basketball coach Tuesday, choosing a candidate who 
was an early focus of the selection committee seeking a successor 
to Mike Deane. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's on everybody's radar screen,'' athletic director Bill  
Cords said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Robert A. Wild, Marquette president, said Crean, 32,  
possesses everything the university was looking for, including 
``great recruiting ability, knowledge of the Midwest, successful 
coaching experience, a tremendous work ethic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deane was fired after the Golden Eagles' season ended with a  
first-round loss in the Conference USA tournament. Cords said at 
the time Marquette's competitiveness had ``gradually eroded'' 
during Deane's five-year tenure, even though he led the team to 
postseason play the previous four years. His record at Marquette 
was 100-55. 
</P>
<P>
	Cords declined to say what qualities Crean brings that Deane  
didn't have. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to compare. I don't think that's fair to  
anyone,'' Cords said. ``He's from a program that set a very high 
level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crean spent the last four seasons as an assistant with the  
Spartans and has been associate head coach the last two. Michigan 
State lost to Duke in the NCAA tournament semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always believed if you've been to that level, you have  
vision,'' Cords said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crean said he brings enthusiasm and a willingness to work hard  
to his first head coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're going to see a selfless team,'' he said. ``It's  
almost the same as unselfishness but it takes it to another level, 
totally committed to your teammates, totally committed to the 
person next to you. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to create a bond here that when we walk into the  
Bradley Center, when we walk into opposing arenas, that we know the 
bond can't be broken,'' Crean said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said Crean has ``multidimensional  
strengths,'' including his recruiting ability. Crean also was 
recruiting coordinator for Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	He recruited and developed Mateen Cleaves, two-time Big Ten  
Player of the Year and a member of this season's Associated Press 
All-America team. 
</P>
<P>
	Crean said recruiting for Marquette will start at home, a method  
he called the ``inside out theory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He inherits one signed recruit, Krunti Hester of Indianapolis.  
He also has one scholarship available when the spring signing 
period begins April 7 and could have more if some players choose to 
transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Mount Pleasant, Mich., Crean was an assistant at  
Alma College, Western Kentucky and Pittsburgh before going to 
Michigan State.

<HEADLINE> Teen-Ager Charged in Ala. Murder </HEADLINE>

<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- A teen-ager was charged with murder in  
the death of a University of Alabama assistant professor killed by 
a 30-pound rock tossed off an Interstate 75 overpass west of Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Highway Patrol officers arrested Juan G. Cardenas, 18,  
after receiving a tip from someone who overheard him talking about 
the Sunday death of Julie Catherine Laible. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators who questioned Cardenas on Monday insisted the  
incident was not a prank that went awry. 
</P>
<P>
	``When an individual picks up a rock that big, they have an  
intent to do harm,'' said Maj. Ron Getman. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were looking for three other suspects.  
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the stone chunk, which was slightly larger than  
a bowling ball, exploded through the windshield of Ms. Laible's 
gray 1995 Honda Civic, striking her head with such velocity that it 
killed her instantly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad justice is being served,'' said her mother, Jean  
Laible of Hobe Sound. ``It won't bring my daughter back, but I hope 
by catching these men it prevents other people from being killed.''

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence Rises Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A strong economy and record stock market  
performance pumped up consumer confidence for a fifth-straight 
month in March, and many Americans expect the good times to 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board reported today that its index of consumer  
confidence rose a stronger-than-expected 0.8 point to 133.9 in 
March from a revised 133.1 in February. The index dropped sharply 
in October and has since been making a steady recovery. The upward 
revision by the business-financed research group made the February 
number even stronger than the 132.1 originally reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator because  
consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall 
economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers were more optimistic in the first quarter of this  
year than they were at the end of last year,'' said Lynn Franco, 
associate director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their appraisal of current business conditions continues to  
sail at record-high levels, with no signs that confidence will 
erode anytime soon. Consumers are continuing to count on steady 
business growth, low inflation and a strong job market through the 
remainder of the century,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey said it found an all-time low 11.8 percent of  
consumers who reported jobs are hard to get. It also reported more 
Americans said they would buy a home, though fewer said they would 
buy a major appliance or a car in the next six months. Fewer 
consumers expect business conditions to get better. 
</P>
<P>
	The index that measures feelings about present conditions rose  
slightly to 177.8 in March from a revised 177.7 in February, 
reaching another new high in the 32 years that the survey has been 
compiled. 
</P>
<P>
	The index that measures expectations for the next six months was  
also higher, rising 1.3 points to 104.7. 
</P>
<P>
	The rising stock market, punctuated by the Dow Jones Industrial  
Average closing for the first time above 10,000 on Monday, was 
cited by analysts as a big reason for the strong consumer 
confidence. But Americans are also less worried about losing their 
jobs, which helps the confidence index. 
</P>
<P>
	Home buying plans was still another positive factor. ``That is a  
shocker because home builders report reduced traffic, and interest 
rates are up,'' said Russ Sheldon, chief economist for Money Watch 
in New York. ``This is a pretty rambunctious bunch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report comes amid strong economic growth in the United  
States, which is surprising to many economists who had expected the 
pace to slow in early 1999 as global financial turmoil threatened 
American prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer confidence index, started in 1967, is compiled from  
responses to questions sent to 5,000 households nationwide. The 
survey polls consumers on matters ranging from job prospects to 
buying plans. The index compares results to its base year, 1985, 
when it stood at 100.

<HEADLINE> Astros' Caminiti Out of Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Houston Astros third baseman Ken Caminiti  
left a hospital on Tuesday after treatment for an acute sinus 
infection and appears headed for the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Caminiti, 35, was admitted to Osceola Regional Hospital on  
Monday, and his infection was treated intravenously. Before the 
sinus problem, Caminiti struggled with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	He has played in only 12 of the Astros' 25 spring games and has  
just 28 at-bats. Manager Larry Dierker and general manager Gerry 
Hunsicker are concerned he might not be ready. 
</P>
<P>
	If the team decides to put Caminiti on the disabled list, he  
couldn't be activated before an April 10 game against Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're looking at something that appears to be a  
long-term problem,'' Hunsicker said. ``But I think we're running 
out of time to get him ready. Starting him on the disabled list is 
a distinct possibility. We're going to evaluate the situation and 
probably make a decision by Friday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Spiers would replace Caminiti at third base while the  
former NL MVP is on the DL.

<HEADLINE> Braves Reliever Wohlers Is Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Mark Wohlers' smile is back. So are his  
95 mph fastball, his control and probably his job as closer for the 
Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, who saved 97 games from 1995-97 but couldn't locate the  
strike zone last year, is recovering just in time to replace his 
successor, Kerry Ligtenberg, who converted 30 of 34 save chances 
last year but needs season-ending elbow surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Ligtenberg out, somebody's got to do it, and it just  
seems right that someone be me,'' said Wohlers, who made his eighth 
appearance of the spring Monday and pitched well despite a 
lingering cold. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wants the ball, he'll get it,'' manager Bobby Cox said.  
``Why not? I have no complaints about anything. He's been throwing 
fastballs by people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Monday's 3-2 victory over Florida, Wohlers pitched a 1-2-3  
ninth, striking out Kevin Orie to end the game for his first save 
since last June 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little nervous out there. I knew the situation,  
obviously,'' Wohlers said. ``A couple of my warmup pitches down in 
the bullpen were a little shaky, but ... I was able to gain control 
of myself and put my focus and concentration on the catcher's 
mitt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, whose fastball averages 95 mph, gave up four runs in  
his first spring outing. But he's been spectacular since, lowering 
his ERA from 36.00 to 5.63. 
</P>
<P>
	In eight innings overall, Wohlers has allowed five earned runs  
and eight hits, striking out nine and walking six. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just been getting better and better,'' Cox said. ``If  
he's on the team and he's throwing like that, there's no reason he 
can't close. Apparently, he's ready for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ready and willing, Wohlers says.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's something I've done for a long time in the minor leagues  
and for a few years up here in the big leagues,'' he said. ``It's 
something I enjoy, one I feel I'm capable of handling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, after converting his first seven save chances,  
Wohlers injured his side and was on the disabled list from May 
3-23. 
</P>
<P>
	After he returned, he got one more save but was never the same.  
His mechanics were fouled up. He couldn't throw a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a 10.18 ERA in 20 1-3 innings with the Braves, walking  
33. It didn't get any better at Triple-A Richmond, where he gave up 
36 walks in 12 1-3 innings and had a 20.43 ERA before the Braves 
ended his season early. 
</P>
<P>
	During the winter, he worked with Guy Hansen, a Braves assistant  
in player development and a former pitching coach, on his mechanics 
-- specifically, his grip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expected to do well because I did a lot of hard work, did a  
lot of things this offseason to at least put myself in position to 
succeed,'' Wohlers said. ``The way I feel right now, I would expect 
to get the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Wohlers, the Braves have John Rocker, Rudy Seanez  
and Mike Cather as potential closers. Rocker has struck out 11 in 
nine shutout innings this spring.

	Clinton Questions Serb-Kosovo Claim  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today the slaughter of  
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo could undermine international support 
for Serbian claims to the province. Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 
percent of Kosovo, but Serbs claim it as a homeland, and are 
fighting to drive the Albanians out of the province. Clinton said 
Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic's ``ethnic cleansing'' of 
Kosovo is an example of ``using ethnic and religious hatred as a 
justification for murdering completely innocent peaceful 
civilians.'' The United States has opposed independence for Kosovo, 
but has pushed for autonomy for ethnic Albanians. 

</P>
<P>
	Milosevic Offers 'Concessions'  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic said today that NATO airstrikes must stop before peace 
talks for Kosovo can resume. Milosevic, who met today with Russian 
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, also said he would reduce his 
forces in Kosovo and allow refugees to return if NATO first halts 
its air assault. NATO, however, has said it won't stop the 
airstrikes unless Milosevic ends the attacks on ethnic Albanians 
and agrees to accept a peacekeeping force in Kosovo under NATO 
leadership. Primakov said the pledge by Milosevic was the outcome 
of their talks. Russia has been a vocal opponent of the airstrikes.

	UN: Congo Rebels Guilty of Abuses  
</P>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Rebel forces in the Congo have massacred civilians  
and enforced a reign of terror that overshadows the widespread 
human rights abuses committed by the government, a U.N. expert said 
today. Chilean lawyer Roberto Garreton in his report accused both 
the government and the rebels of violent abuses while fighting a 
war since August in the Central African nation. The rebels accuse 
Congo President Laurent Kabila, who deposed late dictator Mobutu 
Sese Seko in 1997, of corruption and fomenting ethnic hatred 
against the country's Tutsi minority. Kabila has accused the rebels 
and their Rwandan allies of massacring civilians reluctant to join

fines and penalties and Grupo Financiero Serfin will pay $4.7 
million as part of separate plea agreements with the U.S. 
government. Prosecutors say tens of millions of dollars in drug

	Milosevic Demands That Attacks End  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic  
insisted today that NATO attacks stop before he moves toward peace, 
declaring his forces ready to fight ``to the very end.'' More than 
six hours of talks with Russia's prime minister yielded a statement 
by Milosevic that he was willing to rein in a harsh campaign 
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and resume peace talks if the 
NATO strikes stopped. NATO answered with new resolve to wreck his 
military with a relentless air assault. NATO leaders, including 
President Clinton, warned that atrocities against ethnic Albanians 
would weaken Serbia's claim to the separatist province. 

</P>
<P>
	NATO Prepared To Extend Strikes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO's air assault on Yugoslavia is far from  
accomplishing its goals, but the alliance is pressing ahead with an 
intensified targeting of Serb troop concentrations in Kosovo, U.S. 
officials said today. President Clinton said NATO was solidly 
behind the strategy of diminishing Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic's military capacity. A Pentagon spokesman declined to 
predict how long that might take but said, ``We are prepared to go 
as long as it takes.''

NATO strikes over Kosovo and Serbia, the Air Force was down to 150 
cruise missiles carrying conventional warheads. At least 30 have 
been launched since then. The Navy has more than 2,000 but is using 
them up at a faster rate. The dwindling supply is ``something we do 
worry about,'' a Pentagon spokesman said today. No cruise missile 
production line is in operation.

jury awarded $51.5 million to a Marlboro smoker who has inoperable

announced. Medicare originally had been projected to run short of 
cash in 2001. Today's report moves that deadline to 2015. The

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An environmental group petitioned the FDA to  
tighten its regulation of bottled water after tests showed a third 
of 103 brands exceeded industry or state purity standards. The 
tests on nearly 1,000 samples raise questions about marketing 
claims that bottled water is more pure and healthier than tap 
water, the Natural Resources Defense Council said. But the group 
also said most bottled water was found to be of good quality and 
that none of the test samples posed a health concern.

	Doherty Hired As Notre Dame Coach  
</P>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Matt Doherty, a Kansas assistant, was  
hired today as basketball coach at Notre Dame. Doherty, an 
excellent recruiter, inherits a program that had only three winning 
seasons during its eight years with John MacLeod, who resigned 
March 9. The Irish finished this season with a 14-16 record.

<HEADLINE> Probe Widens in N.M. Torture Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELEPHANT BUTTE, N.M. (AP) -- Dozens of FBI agents, including  
psychological ``profilers'' specializing in macabre crimes, 
converged on a trailer home Tuesday in an apparent murder 
investigation that began with a case of sexual torture. 
</P>
<P>
	The case began to unfold when a woman escaped from the home  
wearing only a padlocked metal collar attached to a chain. She said 
she had been kidnapped and tortured by David Ray and Cindy Hendy. 
</P>
<P>
	Another woman then came forward and said she, too, had been  
tortured. And a friend of Ms. Hendy's told a TV station that Ray 
had killed four to six other victims, mutilated the bodies and 
dumped them in Elephant Butte Lake, 150 miles south of Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have been searching the dusty half-acre lot around  
Ray's double-wide trailer home for several days. They have expanded 
their search for victims or witnesses into Arizona, Texas and 
Mexico and urged anyone else who escaped the couple's torture to 
come forward. 
</P>
<P>
	State Public Safety Secretary Darren White said investigators  
have collected more than 1,000 pieces of evidence, are pursuing 
more than 100 leads ``throughout the country'' and have brought in 
three FBI ``profilers,'' the behavioral specialists depicted in 
``The Silence of the Lambs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very dark, very disturbing case for everyone  
involved,'' White said. ``We believe this case involves more 
victims, and we won't rule out the possibility this case involves 
homicide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he feared divulging too many details because it would  
involve ``descriptions so vile'' other victims might not come 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the nightmare is behind bars,'' White said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ray, 59, is charged with kidnapping and criminal sexual  
penetration. Ms. Hendy, 39, is charged with kidnapping and 
accessory to criminal sexual penetration. Both are charged with 
conspiracy and assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Costales, Ray's attorney, said his client is innocent.  
</P>
<P>
	``I do not believe any of it is founded on anything more than  
rumors, sensationalism,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman who escaped wearing the collar told authorities she  
met Ray and Ms. Hendy in Albuquerque, where Ray showed her a badge 
and told her she was under arrest for prostitution. She said she 
was sexually tortured and shocked with electricity over three days 
at their home near the lake before escaping March 22. 
</P>
<P>
	John Branaugh, a friend of Ms. Hendy's, told KOB-TV over the  
weekend: ``Ray has put four to six bodies in this lake and others 
buried in the desert. When he's done, he gets his surgical tool or 
whatever, splits them right down the middle and that's why they 
wouldn't have no buoyancy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Branaugh said Ms. Hendy told him about the bodies after a night  
of drinking. He said he didn't take it seriously and didn't report 
it until the chained woman escaped. 
</P>
<P>
	Branaugh has an unlisted number and could not be reached for  
comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kitchen, FBI agent in charge for New Mexico, said Ray  
hasn't provided much information. But White said Ms. Hendy ``has 
been a bit more cooperative.'' He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have strung blue tarps across the rear of the Ray  
and Hendy home and set up picnic tables behind the tarps to process 
evidence. The fenced-off property includes a carport with a 
four-wheel-drive vehicle, a couple of storage sheds and two boats. 
</P>
<P>
	Foot-high metal stakes with red and green flags dotted the yard  
where FBI agents catalogued evidence Tuesday. Bone fragments found 
on the scene earlier in the search turned out to be from animals, 
not humans, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bizarre case has stunned the normally quiet lakeside town  
where neighbors know one another and look out for each other's 
property, Mayor Bob Barnes said. Elephant Butte Lake, a manmade 
body of water fed by the Rio Grande, is a popular resort. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just out of character completely for our community,''  
Barnes said. ``I'm shocked, and I think our citizens are shocked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray's neighborhood overlooking Elephant Butte Lake is marked by  
mobile homes and recreational vehicles occupied by people who 
``come down to boat and fish, and they don't want to be bothered, 
because it's a getaway for them,'' the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
	White said Ray had built up a good reputation in the town over  
the past 15 years and knew Elephant Butte State Park rangers: 
``They considered him a very friendly person.''

<HEADLINE> 5 Die in Mich. Fireworks Plant Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSSEO, Mich. (AP) -- The call shocked Hillsdale County Sheriff  
Stan Burchardt: Only months after a deadly blast rocked the nearby 
fireworks factory, another one had just blackened the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I heard about it, I couldn't believe it,'' Burchardt  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Five people were killed in the explosion and fire Monday at  
Independence Professional Fireworks Co., one of the country's 
largest makers of display fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
	A charred wall was all that remained of a small building that  
exploded Monday just 100 yards from the rubble left from the main 
building destroyed in the Dec. 11 blast. 
</P>
<P>
	``This one's not near the explosive blast as the previous one,  
but same deadly result,'' said Ken Hersha with the Michigan State 
Police Fire Marshal Division. 
</P>
<P>
	The two blasts in Osseo -- about 80 miles southwest of Detroit --  
have claimed 12 lives, including that of Robert Slayton, the 
company's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Slayton, 40, was pulled from the rubble alive Monday but died a  
few hours later. Burchardt said dental and medical records will be 
needed to identify the four other victims -- two men and two women. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms  
were expected to comb through the bomb site today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, because this is a tragedy twice in a row, we're  
going to look at everything from a public safety standpoint to make 
sure nobody else gets hurt here,'' said ATF agent Mark Hady ``They 
won't be operating for quite some time, if ever at all, again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The factory was never shut down after the December blast, said  
Maura Campbell, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Consumer 
and Industry Services, which licenses fireworks manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Several residents wondered why the plant remained open.  
</P>
<P>
	``They couldn't pay me enough to go to work there,'' said Jesse  
Hill, who lives in nearby Hillsdale. ``A lot of people are 
concerned.''

<HEADLINE> Hamilton Leads UConn to NCAA Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Richard Hamilton thought the 27  
points he scored in leading Connecticut to its first national 
championship were no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
	See the basket. Shoot the ball. Score the points.  
</P>
<P>
	He makes it sound so simple.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it was hard,'' Hamilton said in his low-key  
style. ``I've been doing the same thing all year. Give credit to my 
teammates. They set extra screens for me. They just get the ball to 
me when I'm open and I hit the shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``The same thing has been going on all year. I got open  
opportunities and I just took advantage of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's nothing complicated about any of that, if you believe  
Hamilton. There's something more involved, though, according to 
coach Jim Calhoun. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing is, he's a great basketball player,'' he said.  
``Great scorers score so many different ways and can beat you so 
many different ways. He has a tremendous mind for the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It added up to an All-American season for Hamilton. He also  
shared the Big East Conference Player of the Year award, joining 
Patrick Ewing and Chris Mullin as the only players to win that 
award twice. And when he went over the 2,000-point mark in 
Saturday's semifinal victory over Ohio State, it made him the 
second highest scorer in UConn history. 
</P>
<P>
	All very nice, but Hamilton was really after a national  
championship. To do it, the Huskies would have to beat a Duke team 
that had lost just once all season and won 32 games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt we had a chance,'' Hamilton said. ``If we came in and  
played our game, we had a good chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew we had to attack. We didn't want to be jumper happy.  
If we got to the paint, we wanted to take advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and the Huskies did that in the 77-74 victory.  
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun knows what a special player Hamilton has become.  
</P>
<P>
	``He scored 27 tonight,'' the coach said. ``Sometimes he puts up  
30 and I'll ask him if his mom and dad were keeping score.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No need for that. Hamilton had all the help he needed from his  
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played with a lot of heart,'' he said. ``Everybody's got  
the mentality of refuse to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton struggled a bit with his shot in the first half, making  
five of 13 attempts. But was 5-for-9 in the final 20 minutes, 
including a pair of 3-pointers. The second one was perhaps his most 
impressive shot of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	With 3:50 to play and the score tied at 68, Hamilton took a shot  
to the midsection from Chris Carrawell and was doubled over, trying 
to catch his breath. After a moment, he walked to the foul line and 
hit both free throws for a 70-68 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, 12 seconds later, Connecticut got the ball back and  
Hamilton's 23-foot shot gave the Huskies a five-point lead. Duke 
never quite recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	As time ran out Monday night, Hamilton reflected on what had  
happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really can't describe that feeling,'' he said. ``I still  
don't understand what we did. I'm just happy to put a smile on 
coach's face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did the same thing last spring when he decided to stay at  
Connecticut for his junior year instead of leaving for the NBA. At 
the time, he thought Calhoun was using some of old fashioned Irish 
blarney to convince him to stick around. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad I stayed for my junior year,'' he said. ``He told me,  
`Rip, you've got a chance to win a national championship.' I really 
didn't believe him. Now that we've won it, I'm very appreciative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is Calhoun.

<HEADLINE> Man Captured in N.Y. Abduction Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST GREENBUSH, N.Y. (AP) -- A man accused of abducting his  
estranged wife from Maine and killing two men who were sheltering 
her was captured Tuesday after police stormed his motel room 
hideout. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found the abducted woman, 36-year-old Deborah Brown, in  
safe condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Brown, 35, and alleged accomplice Patricia Teeter, 39,  
waived extradition and were to be transported to Maine to face 
murder and kidnapping charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials alleged Brown fatally beat and stabbed his  
brother-in-law, Donald Wood Jr., 43, and Christopher Brouillard, 
30, outside their mobile home in Lebanon, Maine, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Teeter lured the two victims one by one by seeking help for  
a disabled vehicle, said Lt. Michael Sperry of Maine State Police. 
Their bodies were found in nearby woods. Police said Mrs. Brown was 
abducted after she tried to flee the house. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and relatives said Mrs. Brown came to Maine to escape a  
tumultuous marriage and was temporarily living at her brother's 
house. She had gained custody of the couple's two children, who 
were with relatives Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> N.H. House Rejects Income Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- New Hampshire's House reversed course and  
voted down a proposed income tax Tuesday, all but assuring that the 
state will preserve its status as one of two states with neither a 
general sales tax nor an income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3.5 percent income tax was proposed as a way of meeting the  
state Supreme Court's Thursday deadline for a new, fairer system to 
pay for schools. The state now relies on widely varying local 
property taxes, which the court ruled unconstitutional in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican-controlled House voted 211-168 against the tax,  
three weeks after a similar proposal passed. That version was 
changed in the Senate, forcing another House vote Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, had promised to veto an income  
tax. She has proposed a solution based on a statewide property tax, 
revised and expanded business taxes, a capital gains tax and video 
gambling at the state's four race tracks. The Senate is expected to 
vote on a version of her plan Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Towns will have no authority to collect property taxes for  
schools after Thursday, although tax bills are not scheduled to be 
issued until June. Two large banks have said they will continue to 
lend money to school districts while a solution is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	Unsure of how much money they will have next school year, some  
school districts already have notified teachers their contracts 
won't be renewed. Many more districts are expected to issue pink 
slips if no solution is found by April 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine states have no income taxes: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New  
Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming. 
New Hampshire and Alaska also have no general sales tax.

<HEADLINE>  Doherty Hired As Notre Dame Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Matt Doherty was hired Tuesday as  
basketball coach at Notre Dame with hopes the long-time Kansas 
assistant can return a lackluster program to national prominence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very proud moment in my life. Everything that Notre  
Dame stands for represents how I try to live my life,'' Doherty 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Growing up Irish Catholic in New York, you couldn't help  
follow Notre Dame, football and basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of Doherty's five-year contract were not disclosed. He  
replaces John MacLeod, who resigned under pressure March 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Dohterty, 37, passed up a chance to play at Notre Dame after he  
was lured to North Carolina by then-Tar Heels assistant Roy 
Williams. He went on to play on the 1982 national championship team 
with Michael Jordan and James Worthy before he graduated in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	He was drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers but never played in  
the NBA, instead working as a government bond salesmen in New York 
City and later as a part-time analyst on the Davidson College 
basketball radio network. 
</P>
<P>
	He then joined the Davidson coaching staff for three years  
before hooking up with Williams again, this time as an assistant at 
Kansas in 1993. Since he joined the staff, the Jayhawks have won 
five conference championships, appeared in the NCAA tournament six 
times and went to the NCAA tournament Final Four in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a passion about Notre Dame that really gave us the  
level of confidence that he would not only kick-start the program 
now but be our coach for a long time,'' athletic director Mike 
Wadsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doherty has already hired one assistant, Doug Wojcik, who has  
been an assistant for nine years at Navy, where he played. 
</P>
<P>
	Doherty inherits a program that finished 14-16 last season and  
has had only three winning seasons since MacLeod took over for the 
1991-92 season. Notre Dame's last trip to the NCAA tournament was 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish also have struggled in the Big East since joining the  
conference for the 1995-96 season. They have an 0-4 record in the 
conference tournament and an overall mark of 27-45 in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame returns three starters next season, including Big  
East rookie of the year Troy Murphy and fellow freshman David 
Graves. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame also has four available scholarships and two highly  
regarded recruits in Mike Monserez of Cincinnati, a 6-foot-5 guard, 
and Matt Carroll, a 6-5 guard from suburban Philadelphia considered 
one of the top 30 recruits in the nation.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Lawsuit Dismissed Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell isn't giving up a  
challenge to his 68-game suspension for choking coach P.J. 
Carlesimo, despite a federal judge's finding that the suit was a 
misuse of the court system. 
</P>
<P>
	Undaunted by a court order requiring him to pay the court costs  
of the NBA and the Golden State Warriors in getting the case 
dismissed, Sprewell will ask the 9th U.S. Circuit of Appeals to 
reinstate it, attorney Robert Thompson Jr. said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Latrell's made the decision to appeal because he believes  
strongly in his case,'' Thompson said from Atlanta. ``We're very 
confident about the results on appeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the NBA said Sprewell should be grateful for the  
results of the arbitration that he is challenging in his suit. The 
arbitrator cut Sprewell's suspension from a year to 68 games, the 
remainder of the 1997-98 season, and overturned the Warriors' 
decision to terminate the last three years of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``For choking the head coach the way he did, he should have been  
charged with a crime,'' league attorney Frank Rothman said. ``I 
think he got off very light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $30 million suit accused the arbitrator of exceeding his  
authority in allowing both the Warriors and the NBA to punish 
Sprewell. The suit also claimed racial discrimination, noting that 
Phoenix Suns forward Tom Chambers, who is white, was not suspended 
for punching an assistant coach a few weeks before Sprewell 
attacked Carlesimo. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker first dismissed the suit last  
July, saying its factual claims were too vague to prove any legal 
violations. He said Sprewell should consider dropping the case, but 
gave him one more chance to make his allegations more specific. 
</P>
<P>
	In a ruling made public Monday, Walker said the refiled suit was  
virtually the same as the first, meritless suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell's ``second baseless (suit) forced unnecessary  
expenditures by defendants (the NBA and the Warriors) and a 
wasteful diversion of this court's resources,'' Walker said. He 
invited the league and the team to submit statements of their 
attorneys' fees and expenses for the dismissal motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, a former All-Star guard, argued with Carlesimo during  
a practice in December 1997, then grabbed him around the neck and 
threatened to kill him, according to witnesses at his arbitration 
hearing. After they were separated and Sprewell left the floor to 
shower and change, he returned and, according to witnesses, punched 
Carlesimo and threatened him again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Warriors initially suspended him for 10 games, then  
terminated the last three years and $24 million of his contract. 
The league increased the suspension to a year. But arbitrator John 
Feerick, after a lengthy hearing, ruled the punishment excessive 
and ordered Sprewell reinstated last July 1. He was later traded to 
the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell said the 68-game suspension cost him $6.4 million in  
salary. His suit sought the return of $5.4 million as well as 
additional damages. 
</P>
<P>
	He argued that his punishment was not authorized by the league's  
union agreement, and accused NBA investigators of destroying 
interview notes and doctoring evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also claimed racial discrimination on several grounds:  
that whites like Chambers were treated more leniently, that the 
Warriors insisted on broader rights to terminate Sprewell's 
contract than they demanded in white players' contracts, and that 
most of the team's and league's upper management is white. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker said the arbitrator reasonably concluded that Sprewell's  
punishment was authorized by the union contract, and had considered 
and rejected his complaints about the evidence, decisions the judge 
would not second-guess. 
</P>
<P>
	Feerick also examined the Chambers incident and others cited by  
Sprewell and found that differing punishments were based on the 
seriousness of the offense, not the race of the player, the judge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell's factual claims, even if proven, would not show that  
the Warriors or the league were motivated by racism, Walker said. 
And even if racial bias were shown, the judge said, Sprewell failed 
to demonstrate ``a public policy that specifically militates 
against suspension of an employee who violently attacks his 
employer.''

<HEADLINE> UCLA Hoop Coaches Get Extensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- UCLA men's basketball coach Steve Lavin and  
women's coach Kathy Olivier each received contract extensions 
Tuesday that will run through the 2005 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Lavin, whose Bruins (22-9) lost in the first round of the NCAA  
tournament, will receive $578,000 a year, a $103,000 raise, and 
also gets a rollover clause for added job security. 
</P>
<P>
	The school has not finalized the compensation package for  
Olivier, who guided the Bruins to the Pacific-10 title and into the 
NCAA round of eight for the first time ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Lavin is 70-26 overall at UCLA.  
</P>
<P>
	``Steve has built an outstanding foundation with his recruiting  
classes,'' UCLA athletic director Peter Dalis said in a statement. 
``We are excited about the direction of the program and are looking 
forward to many more years with Steve as our head coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olivier has a 97-74 record in six years, including 26-8 this  
season as UCLA made its second consecutive appearance in the NCAA 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are excited about the progress of Kathy's program as  
well,'' Dalis said. ``She has made steady improvement each year, 
culminating with the team's Pac-10 title and march to the Elite 
Eight this season.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Slips After Record High Close / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened lower. The Dow Jones  
industrial average is down 44 points in today's early going. Losers 
on the New York Stock Exchange hold a 9-5 lead over gainers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is down four points and the S&AMP;P 500  
Index is down five points. 
</P>
<P>
	Yesterday's Dow 10,000 close may be washed down with a Coke.  
</P>
<P>
	The soft-drink giant has warned that its first quarter sales may  
prove disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
	That should lead to an early decline in Coke shares.  
</P>
<P>
	And, since Coke is a Dow component, there could be some downward  
pressure on the blue chips today, preventing a second-straight 
close above 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, keep in mind the Fed is holding a meeting on interest  
rates today in Washington. And, even though the central bank is 
expected to make no move on rates, it's not uncommon to see Wall 
Street react to word that the Fed has concluded its policy session.

<HEADLINE> NYC Subways Scrap Impolite Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A plan to speed subway service by having train  
conductors eliminate the word ``please'' from their boarding 
announcements been scrapped after officials admitted it was silly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an attempt to do a good thing but not necessarily in  
the best way,'' Transit spokesman Al O'Leary said today. Agency 
brass had suggested that conductors could help speed train service 
by dropping ``please'' from the phrase: ``Please stand clear of the 
closing doors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you add five seconds at every stop by saying 'please,' at  
the end of 60 stops, you're four or five minutes off schedule,'' 
O'Leary said previously, explaining why transit brass wanted 
conductors to edit their boarding spiels. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that some conductors went a bit overboard with their  
discourse. ``We had found that in some stations, in the outer 
boroughs especially, the announcements were taking longer to make 
than it took to load and unload passengers,'' O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan had left riders highly dis-pleased.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's nonsense!'' said Lynnette Taylor as she exited a train at  
Rockefeller Center on Monday. ``If the conductors aren't 
respectful, a lot of people are not going to be comfortable riding 
the train.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of cutting out ``please'' ran counter to a trend,  
anyway. Bridge and tunnel toll collectors are being ordered to say 
``thank you'' and New York City taxis now have cheery recorded 
warnings to fasten seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Rappaport, a spokesman for the Straphangers Campaign, a  
subway riders advocacy group, said the policy was ``just silly. It 
just doesn't take up that much time to say `please,' and it adds 
some civility to a system that needs it.''

<HEADLINE> Societe Generale, Paribas Fight Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- French banks Societe Generale SA and Paribas SA  
pledged Tuesday to fight a hostile takeover attempt by Banque 
Nationale de Paris SA despite regulatory approval for BNP's $37 
billion bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-way merger envisioned by BNP would create a $1  
trillion, world-leading banking group. It comes as European banks 
are joining forces to better compete in a market transformed by the 
region's new common currency, the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP's proposed combination cleared its last regulatory hurdle  
Monday when the French stock market watchdog agency and the Bank of 
France both gave it their blessings. 
</P>
<P>
	Paribas and Societe Generale were completing a $17.2 billion  
friendly merger of their own when BNP stunned the European 
financial world on March 9 with an unsolicited takeover bid for 
both banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We firmly believe that a three-way merger is impossible,''  
Paribas spokeswoman Stephanie Carson-Parker said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Overlap between the retail banking networks of BNP and Societe  
Generale would necessitate branch closures and large-scale layoffs, 
while BNP's plans to continue its investment banking business 
suggests that it hasn't decided how to incorporate similar 
operations at Paribas, Carson-Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
	She refused to say what specific steps Paribas might take to  
fend off BNP. 
</P>
<P>
	A commission that monitors the French stock market ruled Monday  
that BNP's takeover plan contained all the necessary information 
for the tender offer to move forward. The ruling came soon after a 
regulatory subcommittee of the Bank of France said BNP has the 
right to take over at least 50.01 percent of the other two French 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the regulatory approvals, Paribas and Societe  
Generale must hold board meetings by next Wednesday to consider 
BNP's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale spokesman Michel Thibout said his bank would  
not deviate from its original plan to merge with Paribas. He 
refused to say what defensive measures Societe Generale was 
considering. 
</P>
<P>
	A BNP spokesman refused to comment Tuesday when asked about the  
continued objections of Paribas and Societe Generale. However, the 
bank released details of plans to proceed with efforts for a 
two-way merger with either bank if the three-way merger plans fail. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices for all the three banks closed higher in trading  
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks fell today as concerns about Japan's  
weak economy overpowered the record close overnight for the Dow 
Jones industrial average. The dollar edged lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.00 yen in late afternoon, down 0.04 yen  
from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its level of 120.13 yen in 
New York overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 149.72 points, or 0.94  
percent, to close at 15,859.12 points. On Monday, the index slipped 
8.15 points, or 0.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei index had risen some 175 points earlier today after  
the Dow gained 184.54 points to close at a record high of 10,006.78 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But selling set in after a pair reports showed Japan's economy  
remains weak. 
</P>
<P>
	The Management and Coordination Agency said Japan's unemployment  
rate surged to a new record high of 4.6 percent in February, up 0.2 
percentage point from the previous record in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the agency said spending by Japanese workers fell  
4.1 percent in February from the same month last year, the largest 
year on year drop in 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say consumption continues to suffer in Japan as workers  
face ongoing job uncertainty. Many Japanese companies are 
accelerating the pace of restructuring, slashing wages and 
encouraging workers to retire early. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the moment, foreign investors have stopped their buying and  
domestic investors are selling ahead of book closings,'' said 
Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities. The 
accounting year for Japanese companies closes Wednesday with the 
end of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 464  
million shares, up from Monday's turnover of 379 million shares. 
Declines outnumbered advances 760 to 452, with 99 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 0.57 points, or 0.04 percent, to 1,269.24. The 
TOPIX gained 0.89 points, or 0.07 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved as high as 120.69 yen  
early in the session as U.S. investors covered, short, or oversold 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders said the dollar buying binge quickly ran out of  
steam, prompting selling by speculators who had hoped for the rally 
to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no major market moving news in today's trading in  
Tokyo. The dollar traded in a range between 119.85 yen and 120.69 
yen 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 128.88 yen, up from  
128.78 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.735 percent from Monday's finish of 1.820 percent, 
driving its price up to 100.56 yen from 99.82 yen.

<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Students streamed from Connecticut's home  
court and dorms Monday night, dancing around a giant 
university-sponsored bonfire to celebrate the Huskies' 77-74 
victory over favored Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands had packed Gampel Pavilion to watch the championship  
game, blending into a single scream as the final buzzer sounded and 
loudspeakers blared, ``We are the Champions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My dream has finally come true. This makes up for all the  
heartache Duke has caused us so many times,'' said Ellen Truax of 
Sharon, a recent Connecticut graduate who jumped up and down with 
joy. 
</P>
<P>
	Fireworks exploded as a caravan of honking cars snaked through  
the campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Bed frames, couches, chairs and clothing fed a second, smaller  
bonfire outside the freshman dorms known as ``The Jungle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Justin Rice hugged his cousin, freshman Steve Kakowski  
</P>
<P>
	``Finally! Finally!'' Rice said. ``It was the best game I've  
seen. Ricky Moore had the game of his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Frank Colonese of the UConn Police said there were no  
arrests before midnight, and the only injury was a twisted ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything looks fine so far,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Extra officers were brought in to work with state police. The  
lessons of last year's off-campus spring weekend, which triggered 
violence and vandalism, were still fresh in officers' minds, 
according to campus police chief Robert Hudd. 
</P>
<P>
	Along Interstate 95, Department of Transportation traffic signs  
flashed ``UConn mens basketball, 1999 NCAA Champions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Jim Calhoun's ``Coach's'' sports bar in downtown Hartford,  
strangers hugged and high-fived. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of them, and I'm proud to be from Connecticut,''  
said Aurea Mendez of Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
	Downtown Hartford, which had been deserted during the game,  
filled with honking horns and shouting. More than 100 police 
officers were standing by. 
</P>
<P>
	Long before the final score was posted, championship day was  
playing out on campus as a numbers game. 
</P>
<P>
	There were more police, more pizza makers, more beer and --  
thanks to the experience of the 1995 women's team championship -- 
more people making plans for celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Morrell, an administrator in the student union, was busy  
Monday with pre- and post-game logistics. Three 225-square-foot, 
big-screen TVs were set up across the road in Gampel Pavilion. The 
adjacent parking lot had been cleared to serve as the site for the 
bonfire and open air party. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's program has already made school history by reaching  
the Final Four for the first time in 21 tries. 
</P>
<P>
	The party will continue Tuesday afternoon when Husky fans get a  
chance to thank the team in person at a pep rally.

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards $81M in Tobacco Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- In the biggest liability verdict ever  
against the tobacco industry, a jury ordered Philip Morris to pay 
$81 million Tuesday to the family of a man who died of lung cancer 
after smoking Marlboros for four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory by the wife and children of Jesse Williams was the  
second major hit against Philip Morris this year. A San Francisco 
jury awarded $51.5 million last month to a Marlboro smoker who has 
inoperable lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury, which found Williams and the company to be equally  
negligent, awarded $1.6 million in compensatory damages and $79.5 
million in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon's product liability laws require a plaintiff to be no  
more than 50 percent at fault to win damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Although no smoking liability verdict against the tobacco  
industry has survived on appeal, Wall Street analysts had been 
watching the Portland case closely to see if huge damage awards 
against Big Tobacco were now a trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will make the stocks go down,'' said Gary Black, an  
industry analyst with the New York brokerage firm Sanford C. 
Bernstein &AMP; Co. ``This will persuade the industry to start thinking 
the tide may be turning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Williams family, who sought $101 million, alleged the  
company knew its cigarettes could cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony portrayed Williams, a former janitor with the Portland  
school system, as a three-pack-a-day Marlboro smoker who believed 
the manufacturer wouldn't sell a harmful product and who was 
heavily addicted to nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams died in 1997 just five months after he was diagnosed  
with small-cell carcinoma of the lungs. He was 67 and left behind a 
wife, Mayola, and six adult children. 
</P>
<P>
	``My late husband Jesse Williams had a dying wish,'' said Mrs.  
Williams. ``He wanted to make cigarette companies stop lying about 
the health problems of smokers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris attorney Walter Cofer said he will appeal. He  
noted the tobacco industry has a 40-year history of prevailing in 
such cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at this verdict, it was not supported by the  
evidence,'' Cofer said. ``It was a product of passion and 
prejudice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-member Circuit Court jury, which included three smokers  
and four former smokers, spent a little more than two days 
reviewing a month of technical and often conflicting testimony from 
experts in such areas as cancer diagnosis, radiology and the 
chemistry of tobacco smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the medical testimony on both sides was aimed at showing  
that Williams' cancer arose either before or after 1988. If the 
jury concluded that Williams' cancer was caused by cigarettes 
smoked before 1988, Philip Morris couldn't be held liable under 
Oregon law. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Oregon law allows plaintiffs to seek damages  
going back only eight years before the filing of a product 
liability suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the San Francisco case, U.S. juries have awarded damages  
in smoking liability cases only three times -- twice in Florida and 
once in New Jersey. All three verdicts were overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``As little as three years ago most people thought the tobacco  
industry was invulnerable. This case shows we have a crack in the 
dam,'' said John Banzhof, executive director of Action on Smoking 
and Health, a leading tobacco opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments in the Portland case, attorneys for the  
Williams family cited internal Philip Morris documents to bolster 
their claim that the company long knew about the cancer-causing 
potential of cigarettes and hid that information from its 
customers.

<HEADLINE> Settlement Sought in Microsoft Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As secret negotiations begin in an effort to  
settle the Microsoft antitrust case, the government must decide 
whether it will require the company to surrender the lucrative 
blueprints for its Windows software as a condition of ending the 
bitter courtroom fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, which has said it won't reveal details of the  
settlement talks expected to begin today in Washington, bristled 
over indications that government lawyers might put forth such a 
proposal, which they have discussed openly over past weeks along 
with other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	The government contends that allowing other companies to sell  
and modify Windows would successfully dilute Microsoft's influence 
as the monopoly supplier of the software that runs most of the 
world's personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company said legal protections for its own products  
would prevent any mandatory licensing to other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are laws in this country that protect the copyright of  
all companies that create intellectual property,'' spokesman Greg 
Shaw said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also rejected as unacceptable any proposal to break up  
the company, an idea supported by some of its toughest critics in 
the high-tech industry. The government is said not to be actively 
proposing a breakup. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's certainly no breakup of the company into smaller  
companies that I would find very acceptable, and we're certainly 
not thinking about that as a possibility,'' Microsoft President 
Steve Ballmer said Monday in a conference call with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft was expected to meet here today with lawyers from the  
Justice Department and 19 states suing it over alleged antitrust 
violations. Both sides are under orders from a judge to negotiate, 
although experts agree that any settlement is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, in a lengthy recess, is tentatively scheduled to  
resume April 12 but may not continue until mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think the most likely result here is that we'll be back  
at trial,'' Wisconsin Attorney General James Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates declined to speculate about  
chances for success. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that kind of speculation is not valuable,'' he said  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	State attorneys general and their staff lawyers have said  
previously they might consider requiring Microsoft to sell to other 
companies or give away its valuable source code for Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	But these government officials, who met by conference call  
Monday afternoon, wouldn't commit afterward to exactly what they 
may demand in settlement talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had some discussions but have not settled on what our  
settlement position would be,'' Doyle said. ``There are a lot of 
very technical suggestions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Kovacic, a George Washington University antitrust  
expert, predicted Microsoft would find any proposal to surrender 
its Windows blueprint ``out of the question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also characterized the proposal as a nuclear-weapon-style  
demand by the government, akin to calls for breaking up the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a breakup is a megaton weapon, then forced licensing is a  
high-kiloton yield -- it's just a smaller nuclear package,'' Kovacic 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said last week it won't accept restrictions on what  
new features it can add to Windows. But it indicated it would 
consider changing some of its most controversial agreements with 
computer makers and Internet providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also asked U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson  
on Monday to make America Online, Netscape Communications and Sun 
Microsystems turn over more e-mails about AOL's recent $9.9 billion 
purchase of Netscape and a related deal with Sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson on Friday told Microsoft it can question Steve Case,  
AOL's chairman, and three other executives about their plans and 
the possible impact on the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, Netscape and Sun are rivals of Microsoft, which contends  
that the alliance of the three companies illustrates healthy 
competition in the high-tech industry.

<HEADLINE> Blue Devils Falter in Close Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- For 39 minutes, Trajan Langdon lived  
up to his nickname of The Alaskan Assassin, keeping Duke in the 
national championship game with timely jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
	The senior's 3-pointer with 1:44 left Monday night pulled the  
Blue Devils within one point of Connecticut, and seemingly shifted 
the momentum Duke's way. 
</P>
<P>
	That momentum, however, was short-lived for a team that had  
dominated the college basketball year with 24 of its 37 wins by 20 
or more points. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3 guard, who scored 25 points, couldn't come through  
for Duke in the final seconds, traveling on a drive with 5.4 
seconds left. He then lost the ball on a desperation dash down 
court in a crushing 77-74 NCAA championship loss to the Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was him against me,'' said Ricky Moore, UConn's  
defensive stopper who was guarding Langdon on the play when he 
traveled. ``My will to win was going to take over and it did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no second-guessing from Duke players and coaches over  
who had the ball at the end of the team's 32-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will walk down any road with Trajan Langdon,'' said coach  
Mike Krzyzewski, who earlier in the week said he had a special bond 
with his senior leader. ``I'm fine with that (play). The ball was 
in our best player's hands with an opportunity to win the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A somber Duke locker room, with many players staring off into  
the distance in silent disbelief, centered as much on Langdon not 
getting a title as the team walking away without the championship 
hardware. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tough loss and it's just frustrating to see a guy  
like Trajan Langdon not to go out on top,'' junior Chris Carrawell 
said. ``I am going to see him do well in the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant coach Quin Snyder, himself a shooting guard for  
Krzyzewski who went to three Final Fours but never won one, was 
close to tears when asked about Langdon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trajan has been such a champion for us through his career,  
there is no better big-game player. He has made so many big shots 
for us and won so many games,'' Snyder said of the school's career 
3-point leader. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, the even-tempered Langdon was a stand up guy about the  
key play down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Moore was on me the whole game, it was no different than the  
whole game,'' Langdon said. ``I just wanted to make a move. I've 
been in that situation a tons of times. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way the game goes. But that's not the game, there's  
millions of plays in that game that determine the outcome. So, I'm 
not going to hang my head on that play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski, who had won 80 percent of his NCAA tournament games  
coming in, said he never thought about calling a timeout before 
Langdon's travel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the whole momentum of the game,'' he said. ``We've  
practiced those situations. To me, we had the advantage on them. I 
think it's aggressive, and it's winning. We were going for the 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, all the double-digit wins didn't matter as Duke  
became the 20th straight team with zero or one loss entering the 
tournament to come away without the crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski's wife, Mickie, buried her hands in her face after  
the final horn, and Langdon was consoled by Snyder as the Blue 
Devils walked off the court in stunned disbelief, heads hanging 
low. 
</P>
<P>
	But not their coach.  
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who expects me to be down about this game, they don't  
understand me,'' Krzyzewski said. ``I'm not going to be down about 
this game because it would take away from my experience with this 
group.''

	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Denver Nuggets rookie Keon  
Clark was taken to hospital as a precaution to have his chest

<HEADLINE> Alabama's Sex Toy Ban Is Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- A state law banning the sale of  
vibrators and other sexual aids has been overturned by a federal 
judge because it bears no ``rational relation to a legitimate state 
interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Lynwood Smith ruled Monday that the state's  
1998 law is ``overly broad'' and said people who used the devices 
would be ``denied therapy for, among other things, sexual 
dysfunction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six women, who either sell sex toys or say the devices are  
necessary for sexual gratification they cannot get otherwise, 
challenged a part of the law that banned the devices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We succeeded in kicking the government out of our bedroom,''  
said Sherri Williams, a plaintiff who sells sex devices at stores 
in Huntsville and Decatur. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the statute, selling or distributing ``any obscene  
material or any device designed or marketed as useful primarily for 
the stimulation of human genital organs'' is a misdemeanor 
punishable by as much as one year in jail and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The law hasn't been enforced pending the outcome of the suit.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith wrote that ``a majority, or at least a significant  
minority, of the proscribed devices, as a matter of law, are not 
obscene under any established definition of obscenity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, however, didn't support the women's argument that the ban  
violates privacy rights by indirectly prohibiting adults from 
engaging in legal acts in their own bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing U.S. Supreme Court precedents, he wrote that ``this court  
refuses to extend the fundamental right of privacy to protect 
plaintiffs' interest'' in using sex toys. 
</P>
<P>
	The sex-toy ban was part of a bill sponsored by Sen. Tom Butler,  
D-Madison. Butler said he has no plans to introduce new legislation 
aimed at the devices. 
</P>
<P>
	The main purpose of the bill was to regulate nude dance clubs,  
he said. That part of the law still stands, but is being challenged 
separately in federal court.

<HEADLINE> Driver Survives Train Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANDERSON, Ind. (AP) -- Shrieking with fear, a young woman whose  
car was being dragged by a freight train frantically used her 
cellular phone to call her mother and 911. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mom! Mom! I need help,'' 20-year-old Amber Scott screamed  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the battery on the phone was cutting in and out, and she  
couldn't be sure if she was actually talking to her mom or the 
answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
	She called 911 and screamed: ``I'm being dragged ... by a train!  
Oh, please help!'' But, unsure whether she was being understood 
over the roar of the Conrail freight going at 30 mph, Ms. Scott 
hunkered down in her seat, afraid the car might roll over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just waited,'' she said Tuesday. ``I prayed the whole  
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In seven terrifying minutes, Ms. Scott's car was dragged four  
miles before it apparently hit a railroad sign and was knocked 
loose from the train. She suffered little more than a concussion, a 
sore back and bumps and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like it was a miracle,'' Ms. Scott said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's Maj. Ron Richardson said: ``She was very, very  
lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scott had been headed to classes at Ball State University in  
Muncie when she was rear-ended by a pickup truck and pushed under a 
middle car of the moving train. Conrail spokesman Ron Hildebrand 
said the crew couldn't see Ms. Scott and didn't know a car had 
become trapped. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she thought briefly about trying to roll out her  
passenger-side door but decided against it when she saw how fast 
the train was going. 
</P>
<P>
	Two 17-year-old boys who knew Ms. Scott from high school heard  
the commotion from the wreck and followed the trail of debris, 
eventually finding a bleeding Ms. Scott standing near her mangled 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like the person that was in it should have been  
dead,'' said one of the teens, Mike Imel. 
</P>
<P>
	They called Ms. Scott's mother, who immediately went to find her  
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know there had to be arms around her,'' Patricia Scott  
said. ``There has to be a plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pickup's driver was cited for having no insurance.

<HEADLINE> Boxer McCall To Be Freed Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINSVILLE, Va. (AP) -- A judge agreed Tuesday to release  
former heavyweight champion Oliver McCall from the city jail May 1 
-- almost six months early -- if McCall remains in a drug 
rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
	McCall was arrested Oct. 14 on charges of resisting arrest and  
assault and battery of a law enforcement officer. He was convicted 
Dec. 18 and sentenced to one year in jail and 10 years probation, 
and given credit for the time served while awaiting trial. McCall's 
past also includes a series of run-ins with the law he has blamed 
on addiction to crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always heard you have to hit your rock bottom; I've hit  
my rock bottom,'' McCall told Martinsville Circuit Judge Charles 
Stone. ``I don't like jail. I don't like being told when to get up, 
when to eat. That irritates me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boxing promoter Don King testified for about 40 minutes on  
McCall's behalf, saying he will provide help to McCall in an Ohio 
training camp. King said McCall ``wants to rededicate his life and 
redouble his efforts to being a productive citizen. I think this is 
the way of extending a helping hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone said he recognizes that the 35-year-old fighter's career  
opportunities are waning, and said he would agree to release him on 
the conditions that McCall continue in a drug rehabilitation 
program, be on probation and submit to random drug testing three 
times every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he has reservations about the release.  
</P>
<P>
	``You have the best of intentions, when you've been caught and  
you are in jail and you're away from the (drugs),'' Stone told 
McCall. ``... But when you get out there, that all flies out the 
window and all you want to do is get cocaine. I've seen it happen 
again and again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCall said his first priority when free will be his family. He  
has seven children, and told Stone: ``I have missed my children. I 
have missed their basketball games. The family is the first 
thing.''

<HEADLINE> Source: Mexico Banks Did Launder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two of Mexico's biggest banks agreed to plead  
guilty today to laundering millions of dollars in drug money in a 
case that has strained relations between the United States and its 
southern neighbor, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grupo Financiero Bancomer S.A. and Grupo Financiero Serfin S.A.  
will each pay $500,000 in criminal fines. Bancomer also will 
forfeit about $9.4 million in money seized by authorities. Serfin 
will forfeit about $4.2 million in seized money, according to a 
source familiar with the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors planned to drop charges against a third Mexican  
financial institution, Banca Confia. Confia, which sold most of its 
assets to Citibank after it was indicted, agreed to forfeit $12.1 
million seized from its U.S. holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is part of $100 million seized from 14 banks and  
dozens of individuals in Operation Casablanca, a three-year 
investigation of money laundering activities of Colombia's Cali 
drug cartel and the Juarez cartel in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors say tens of millions of dollars in drug  
profits were laundered through phony transactions to Mexican-owned 
banks to conceal their origin. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks had denied wrongdoing, saying any illegal activity was  
committed by rogue employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Bancomer and Serfin were scheduled to enter pleas  
this afternoon in a hearing before U.S. District Judge Lourdes 
Baird. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea agreement, originally reported by the Los Angeles Times  
and New York Times, doesn't end the case. Jury selection started 
Monday for six Mexican bankers and businessmen charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also are working out a civil settlement with Banco  
Industrial Venezuela, one of two Venezuelan banks implicated in the 
case. Similar civil actions may be filed against other banks where 
funds were seized, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation raised tension between the United States and  
Mexico when agents arrested 167 people, including top Mexican 
bankers and executives. Mexico accused the United States of 
intruding on Mexican sovereignty by conducting a sting operation 
without its involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Bancomer and Serfin, Mexico's second- and third-largest banks,  
still face possible hearings before the Federal Reserve Board to 
decide whether they will be allowed to continue to operate in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Banca Serfin's attorney has said the loss of a license could  
also result in a bank's ``inability to raise money in the 
international capital markets which would be the ultimate death 
penalty.''

<HEADLINE> Woman To Give Up Baby After Mix Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They were born to the same woman on the same  
day, loved and cared for in the same way, and raised as brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 3-month-old boys are not related. One is black, one is  
white. They ended up in the same womb apparently due to a doctor's 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the only mother the boys have ever known says she'll return  
the child who does not share her DNA -- the black child -- to his 
genetic parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're giving him up because we love him,'' Donna Fasano said  
in a handwritten statement supplied by her lawyer Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of these boys are beautiful -- two precious, normal little  
boys,'' said her lawyer, Ivan Tantleff. ``They sit in the swing 
together. They sit in the tub together. ... We're going to try to 
arrange some kind of visitation rights so the boys grow up to know 
that they are brothers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rudolph Silas, lawyer for the black couple, Deborah  
Perry-Rogers, a nurse, and Robert Rogers, a teacher, of Teaneck, 
N.J., said they are amenable to visitation. ``It's in the 
children's best interest,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Silas said the Rogerses will likely get custody in a few weeks,  
after DNA tests and legal papers are completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``My clients are both ecstatic,'' Silas said. ``They are the  
proud parents of a 3-month-old baby boy. Of course there's some 
mixed emotions in the manner in which it's been brought to this 
point. But they're happy she made the decision she's made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``We would have wished to have been a lot more  
involved earlier. But we appreciate the stress she was under.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case began April 24, 1998, when Mrs. Fasano and Mrs.  
Perry-Rogers underwent embryo implantations in the Manhattan 
offices of Dr. Lillian Nash. Only Mrs. Fasano became pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	Nash later advised Mrs. Fasano she might have mistakenly  
received someone else's embryo. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Fasano sought DNA testing from another doctor and learned,  
while the babies were still in utero, that one was not hers. She 
did not know the other parents' identity until the Rogerses sued 
the Fasanos and Nash on March 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``This wasn't my doing,'' Mrs. Fasano said in her statement.  
``People with infertility problems should be able to go to their 
doctors and trust them to do the right thing. To them it may be a 
job; to me it's my life. ... (Nash) may have given me two beautiful 
babies but she destroyed their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tantleff said the Fasanos, who are in their late 30s and work in  
finance, will also sue Nash. A call to Nash was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	George Annas, a professor of health law at the Boston University  
School of Public Health, said Mrs. Fasano's decision ``seems like a 
reasonable solution but it's got to be heart-wrenching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is her son's brother. It is her child. They are twins,  
raised in the same uterus. They've been together for 14 months. 
They're twins in every sense -- except genetic,'' Annas added. ``The 
other mother did provide the genes, but she has no relationship 
with them. That's the tragedy of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Lykken, professor emeritus from the University of  
Minnesota and an expert on twins, said if the boys are separated 
this young, there should be no lasting impact on their development. 
</P>
<P>
	Is Mrs. Fasano the black child's mother? Lawyers agree that the  
woman who gives birth is legally considered the child's mother 
regardless of DNA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad we don't have to contest that and litigate,'' Silas  
said. ``Her decision to do it voluntarily saves us a lot of 
heartache.''

<HEADLINE> VW May Have Cheaper Car in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAUNSCHWEIG, Germany (AP) -- Volkswagen is planning a cheaper  
model of its new Beetle for Germany, which has shown scant interest 
in the car compared to its huge success in the United States, a 
newspaper said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We let ourselves be led by the enthusiasm in America. That was  
a mistake. The U.S. situation cannot be applied to Germany,'' VW 
Chairman Ferdinand Piech was quoted as saying in the daily 
Braunschweiger Zeitung. 
</P>
<P>
	The new model would have a less-powerful engine and cost under  
30,000 marks, or $16,430, the report said That would be about 5,000 
marks, or $3,000, less than the current model.

	VW did not immediately return calls seeking confirmation.

	The new Beetle, made in Mexico, was a hit in the United States,  
where nostalgia is strong for the earlier, 1960s version. About 
40,000 Beetles were sold in the car's first six months on the U.S. 
market last year, with a basic price of $15,200. 
</P>
<P>
	The car drew a lot of attention when it debuted in Germany in  
November, but sales have been lagging, apparently because of the 
price.

<HEADLINE> Christopher's Portrait Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With President Clinton in attendance, a  
portrait of former Secretary of State Warren Christopher was 
unveiled Tuesday at a State Department ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	In brief remarks, Clinton hailed Christopher for his modesty and  
his contributions to peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher, Clinton said, ``had about the lowest ratio of ego  
to accomplishment of any public servant I've ever worked with. ... 
He never thought you had to hit below the belt to get above the 
fold in the morning newspaper. He was always willing to go the 
extra mile for peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher said having his portrait painted was in some ways a  
typical Washington experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, you're painted into a corner, then you're hung out to  
dry and finally you're framed,'' he said, drawing laughter from the 
many friends and former colleagues in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher has practiced law in Southern California after  
completing his service as Clinton's first secretary of state in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The portrait will be hung on the seventh floor of the State  
Department along with those of other secretaries of state.

<HEADLINE> FCC Not Too Worried About Y2K Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Year 2000 computer bug probably won't  
cause major telephone or television glitches, but people still 
should limit their use of phones and computer modems on Jan. 1, a 
government report said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a comprehensive analysis how the so-called Y2K problem could  
affect communications, the Federal Communications Commission said 
large companies -- local telephone, long-distance, broadcast TV, 
radio, cable TV, satellite and wireless -- are making progress to 
fix their systems to accommodate the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ... are cautiously optimistic about the ability of these  
companies to withstand even unforeseen problems with minimum 
disruptions to the services they provide,'' the report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	These large companies -- whether providing telephone or  
television services -- serve most individuals and businesses. The 
top 20 local phone companies, for instance, provide service to more 
than 97 percent of all U.S. customers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report said some small- and medium-sized companies are  
lagging in progress, largely because they lack the technical 
expertise and the money to make necessary changes, said FCC 
Commissioner Michael Powell, the agency's point person on the Y2K 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K bugs occur because many computers programmed to  
recognize only the last two digits of a year won't work properly 
beginning Jan. 1, 2000, when machines might assume it is 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's goal is to make sure the quality and reliability of  
telephone and television services aren't changed on and after Jan. 
1, Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report offers tips for avoiding or minimizing disruptions,  
such as limiting phone and modem use on Jan. 1, saying ``heightened 
traffic volume could overtax the network.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reason: If every person in the United States at the same  
time made a call on Jan. 1 just to see whether it would go through, 
the telephone network -- which does have capacity limits -- would be 
overloaded, resulting in busy signals and delays, said Powell and 
John Koskinen, chairman of the president's council on Year 2000 
conversion. 
</P>
<P>
	As for emergency calls to 911, Powell said ``nothing we have  
seen yet suggests widespread problems.'' But he added: ``We think 
it prudent to expect some delays in the call processing in some 
systems of 911 calls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said problems could occur if local governments, which run 911  
dispatch centers, don't fix their equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also suggests that people have at least one telephone  
-- such as a cellular phone -- that doesn't require electricity and 
that they try to place important calls, particularly those 
overseas, before or after New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Countries in Central and South America, for instance, face a  
``high risk'' that their telecommunications systems will experience 
problems, the report said. U.S. phone companies rely on foreign 
carriers to complete calls to those countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the report said large wireless companies appear to be  
on track with fixes and that the Y2K problem probably won't affect 
satellites in orbit, it also cautioned that some companies didn't 
disclose their progress preparing for problems.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets Nigeria's Obasanjo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton met Tuesday with  
President-elect Olesegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, who said he will 
build democracy in the West African nation despite ``the views and 
the thinking of the skeptics'' who say corruption will endure. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Obasanjo talked for roughly a half-hour about  
establishing democratic rule in Nigeria, Africa's most populous 
nation and one regarded by the Clinton administration as a 
potential force for political stability in the rest of the 
continent. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Obasanjo said he assured Clinton that Nigeria will  
continue to lead a West African peacekeeping force now deployed in 
Sierra Leone, which is wracked by civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, he said he will work to ensure that Nigeria's  
military becomes more professional and performs its constitutional 
role. ``We will give them what they need to look after their 
welfare, but we will also keep them under the control of the 
civil'' authority, Obasanjo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton emphasized that democracy is essential if Nigeria hopes  
to experience increased investment and economic reform, said White 
House national security spokesman Mike Hammer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obasanjo was very much committed to democracy as the basic way  
for the future of Nigeria,'' Hammer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo, a retired general, was Nigeria's military leader from  
1976 until 1979, when he returned power to a civilian government. 
The military took over again four years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo had been jailed by Nigerian dictator Gen. Sani Abacha,  
who died last June. After Abacha died, his successor, Gen. 
Abdulasalam Abubakar, steered Nigeria toward civilian rule and 
Obasanjo was elected in February. 
</P>
<P>
	His current U.S. tour is part of an overall tour of several  
countries before his May 29 inauguration. Besides Clinton, Obasanjo 
also met Tuesday with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and 
Defense Secretary William Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has been invited to Obasanjo's inauguration but has not  
yet said whether he will attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo said he would work to eliminate crime and drug  
trafficking, as well as the rampant corruption that has placed 
Nigeria high among the world's most corrupt countries and imperiled 
it for most of its existence. Nigeria won its independence from 
Britain in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand and sympathize with the skeptics, but I don't go  
by the views and the thinking of the skeptics,'' Obasanjo said. 
``The success of democracy in Nigeria will signal success and be a 
catalyst to success of democracy elsewhere in West Africa, and 
indeed in Africa.''

<HEADLINE> Nuggets, Avalanche May Be Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A subsidiary of Ascent Entertainment Group  
reportedly has reached a tentative agreement to sell the Denver 
Nuggets, the Colorado Avalanche and the Pepsi Center to a group 
headed by a former college basketball player, Bill Laurie, The 
Denver Post reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Ascent Sports' teams and the $170 million arena, which is under  
construction, are worth at least $400 million, the newspaper 
reported, quoting unidentified NBA sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Lyons, Ascent's chief executive officer, declined  
comment through a spokesman. Laurie, whose wife is an heir to the 
Wal-Mart Corp. fortune, also declined comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation about the possible sale of the two teams has been  
rumored for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, KMGH-TV said Ascent executives were discussing a  
possible sale with Wal-Mart officials. Lyons called that report 
inaccurate and Wal-Mart executives denied corporate involvement in 
any talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie met Nancy Walton while the two attended high school in  
Versailles, Mo. He was a guard at Memphis State and then coached 
high school basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Walton's late father, James ``Bud'' Walton, and his brother,  
Sam, co-founded the Wal-Mart chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Ascent's foray into professional sports began in the early 1990s  
when, as COMSAT Video Enterprises, it spent $17 million for a 
majority interest in the NBA's Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, it paid $65 million for the Avalanche of the NHL.

	NATO Steps Up Air Attacks on Serbs  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is sending five B-1 bombers and  
additional radar-evading jets to Europe for intensified NATO 
airstrikes on Serb troops. A Pentagon spokesman said the planes 
will target troops and military vehicles. But he said that the 
Yugoslav military is widely dispersed in mountainous terrain, 
making for difficult targets. NATO has promised to continue 
airstrikes until Yugoslavia's military can't continue routing the 
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo or until President Slobodan Milosevic 
agrees to sign a peace agreement granting ethnic Albanians autonomy 
in the province. Meanwhile, a Yugoslav official for the first time 
acknowledged that atrocities by Yugoslav troops in Kosovo may be 
occurring. 

</P>
<P>
	Russia Premier Meets With Milosevic  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny  
Primakov is in the Yugoslav capital to meet with President Slobodan 
Milosevic and push for a diplomatic solution to the Kosovo crisis. 
Russia has been a vocal opponent of the NATO airstrikes on Serb 
targets. In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said the 
attacks violate international law, but said his country will not 
get involved militarily. He also said he doesn't want the crisis to 
undermine relations with the United States.

<P>
	Fed Said Unlikely To Change Rates  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve's policy-making panel will  
meet today, and in light of continued U.S. economic growth, most 
economists expect that the Fed will vote to leave short-term 
interest rates unchanged. The Fed says a rate cut is not needed to 
stave off recession. The Fed has not changed interest rates since 
last Nov. 17, the day it cut its benchmark rate on overnight loans 
between banks for the third time in seven weeks. Those moves were 
taken after Russia's economic crisis sent Wall Street reeling and 
threatened to induce a U.S. credit crunch.

	Blair Calls for Trust in N.Ireland  
</P>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- British Prime Minister Tony  
Blair appealed today for Northern Ireland's rival politicians to 
overcome their differences and form a coalition government. The 
Protestant-Catholic government is the linchpin of the nearly 
year-old peace accord. Blair called Protestant demands for Irish 
Republican Army disarmament before the government can be formed ``a 
dispute that goes to the heart of the agreement, because it is 
about trust. Without trust between the parties, this agreement 
isn't going to work.'' The accord calls for the IRA to finish 
disarming in cooperation with an international commission by May 
2000, but specifies no starting point.

	Japan Jobless Rate Hits Record High  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A shrinking economy and spreading layoffs drove  
Japan's jobless rate to a record 4.6 percent last month, jumping 
sharply from January and swelling the ranks of jobless to a 
historical 3.1 million. The figures come as Japan is battling its 
deepest economic slowdown in 50 years. The government has pumped 
billions of dollars into the economy in an all-out campaign to prod 
consumers to spend. A major factor behind spreading joblessness is 
corporate restructuring.

Connecticut won its first NCAA men's basketball title with a 77-74

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 93.52 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average retreated from  
10,000 in mixed trading today as technology stocks held on to early 
gains but Coca-Cola dropped sharply on a disappointing sales 
forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Closed at 9,913.26, down 93.52, having trimmed an  
earlier 132-point loss. The 103-year blue-chip index was taking a 
breather after Monday's session, when it made its first close above 
10,000, rising 184.54 to 10,006.78. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke put a swift end to the Dow 10,000 party when it warned late  
Monday that first-quarter sales would be soft. The Dow's technology 
components, like IBM, stepped into the breach to minimize the 
losses, but it wasn't enough to keep the Dow index in positive 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, the 10,000 euphoria is wearing a little thin right at  
the moment,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment officer at 
BankBoston, who said he was concerned that the market was showing 
signs of ``tired leadership. It's getting too monotonous and too 
old,'' with standard performers like technology and health care 
stocks again carrying the market's load. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite strength in technology shares, broader stock indicators  
fell. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 9.42 at 1,300.75 and 
the Nasdaq composite index down 11.00 at 2,481.84.	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 9.42 to 1,300.75, and the 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 12.55 to 2,480.29. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,276 up, 1,716 down and 573 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 725.48 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
742.99 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 4.51 to 608.65, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 6.25 to 711.63. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies declined 0.92 to  
398.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Blaming worldwide economic problems, Coke projected a 1 percent  
to 2 percent first-quarter decline in case volume, which is how the 
soft drink industry measures shipments. The company usually meets 
annual growth targets of 7 percent to 8 percent. Coke was down 1 1/2 
today at 63 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke's story illustrated how the market remains vulnerable to  
worldwide economic problems that are hindering corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Had Coke made its announcement earlier on Monday, it would have  
been enough to prevent the Dow from closing above 10,000. At 4 p.m. 
Monday, Coke shares were up 1 7/8 at 67 3/8. After the announcement, it 
gave that gain back in after-hours trading and ended the day down 
1/2. The total loss Monday of 2 3/8 is the equivalent of more than 10 
points on the Dow, or enough to have left the blue-chip index below 
10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The losses were minimized by a strong performance in technology  
shares, especially Internet-related stocks. AOL was up 12 1/4 at 144 5/8 
on the Big Board. Dow member IBM was up 11/16 at 178 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks eased with crude prices, pushing Dow component Exxon  
down 1 7/8 to 71 1/8. But lower oil prices pushed up airline stocks. US 
Airways Group climbed 4 3/8 to 50 7/8, after the airline said it would 
meet analysts' first-quarter estimates of 46 cents a share. The Dow 
Jones transportation index was up 71.88 at 3,366.25. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues had a slim lead  
on advancers. Volume was moderate and down from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board reported today its index of consumer  
confidence rose a better-than-expected 0.8 point in March. A strong 
economy and record stock market performance pumped it up for a 
fifth straight month, and the Conference Board said there are no 
signs that consumer confidence will erode any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.94 percent. In  
afternoon trading, In Europe, the markets were mixed after the 
European Commission cut its forecast for economic growth this year 
by almost a half percentage point to 2.2 percent. Germany's DAX 
index was down 0.41 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.18 
percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.28 percent.

<HEADLINE> Duke Teams Get Heroes' Welcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- It was supposed to be coronation day at  
Duke. Instead, stunned Blue Devils fans were left to cheer two 
record-setting basketball teams for seasons that ended in painful 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of about 3,000 mixed with bleary-eyed students and  
starry-eyed children gave the men a vigorous standing ovation as 
they entered a blue-carpeted stage set up in Cameron Indoor Stadium 
less than 15 hours after a 77-74 loss to Connecticut in the NCAA 
championship game in St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss took some luster off a school record-tying 37  
victories, an unprecedented unbeaten run through the Atlantic Coast 
Conference and the team's fifth Final Four appearance of the 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The ovation was loud but not to the usual standards of the  
notoriously rowdy arena.

	``The saddest thing that happens to me is when you can sometimes  
focus on what has to happen or what doesn't happen or what didn't 
happen and you lose focus on what did happen,'' Krzyzewski told the 
crowd. ``You're all disappointed about what didn't happen. We're 
disappointed. But what did happen was unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women's team also set a school record for victories (29),  
captured its second straight ACC title and reached its first Final 
Four by beating top-ranked Tennessee, the benchmark program of 
women's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	About 500 fans welcomed the women's team, which lost to Purdue  
in the national championship game in San Jose, Calif., on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were not many people who believed we could do it,'' Duke  
coah Gail Goestenkors said. ``When we started 1-3, people were 
shaking their heads. Now a lot of people are still shaking their 
heads but they're wondering, `What happened? How'd we make this 
turnaround?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior guard Trajan Langdon, who lost the ball on the final play  
of Monday's loss, led in the men's team clad, fittingly, in black 
warmups. 
</P>
<P>
	He took a deep breath and raised his record-setting shooting  
hand to the crowd as he stepped to a podium to enthusiastic cheers 
that lasted more than a minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have it end the way it did this year for this team, it's  
been amazing,'' Langdon said. ``It's been the best year of my life. 
I'm so honored and blessed to be a part of this program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Langdon finished his career as the No. 9 scorer in Duke history  
with 1,974 points. His 112 3-pointers this season and 342 for his 
career are school records. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski defended Langdon, who made two critical turnovers in  
the final 30 seconds of Monday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Making a big play is terrific, but stepping up to make a big  
play is even better,'' Krzyzewski said. ``You're not going to make 
every big play but you can always step up to make big plays. It 
takes courage and Trajan has amazing courage. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we were down by one in the last few seconds, we had a  
chance to win it. The ball was in his hands and he had the courage 
to step up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation has swirled recently that center Elton Brand and  
point guard William Avery, both sophomores, would become the first 
two Blue Devils to leave school early and enter the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he was staying in school, Brand smiled amid a  
swarm of autograph-seeking fans and said only, ``I'm not sure yet, 
but hopefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avery slipped away before he could be asked about the  
speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils could also lose reserve center Chris Burgess,  
who will decide this summer whether he will go on a Mormon mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the potential loss of that trio, the Blue Devils  
should still be a championship contender next season after luring 
one of the nation's top recruiting classes. 
</P>
<P>
	The incoming freshmen include Mike Dunleavy Jr., a 6-foot-7  
forward and the son of Portland coach Mike Dunleavy; Nick Horvath, 
a 6-10 center from Arden Hills, Minn.; Casey Sanders, a 6-11 
shot-blocking specialist from Tampa, Fla.; and Jason Williams, a 
6-2 guard from Plainfield, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy, Sanders and Williams were named to the U.S Junior  
National Select Team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a time to make idle promises, but we're going to do  
something next year,'' Krzyzewski said.

<HEADLINE> American Home To Cut 3,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, N.J. (AP) -- American Home Products Corp. will eliminate  
almost 3,000 jobs worldwide, including employees at two research 
facilities in Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyeth-Ayerst International, AHP's pharmaceutical division based  
in St. Davids, Pa., will bear the brunt of the layoffs, company 
spokesman Lowell Weiner said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,000 people at its research and production facilities  
will lose their jobs this year and another 1,000 gradually will be 
discharged over the next four years. Some 500 vacancies within the 
division, which makes the popular estrogen pill Premarin, will not 
be filled. 
</P>
<P>
	American Cyanamid, the agricultural products division  
headquartered in Parsippany, will cut 400 positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiner would not break down how many jobs will be eliminated at  
the divisions' individual facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts represent nearly 6 percent of American Home's global  
work force of 52,000 people. Of that, 3,800 work in New Jersey 
facilities, including the company's headquarters here. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been plagued with thousands of lawsuits over its  
recalled diet drugs, Pondimin, half of the popular fen-phen 
combination, and Redux, as well as its birth control device 
Norplant. The company also recalled its painkiller Duract last year 
after it was found to cause liver damage in certain patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiner said those lawsuits had nothing to do with the layoffs.  
</P>
<P>
	``We did this to increase efficiencies and productivity in an  
increasingly competitive marketplace,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products is also canceling two research programs  
for cardiovascular and metabolic disease. It will focus on 
infectious and muscular/skeletal diseases, neuroscience, oncology, 
vaccines and women's health. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves come after disappointing results in last year's fourth  
quarter, when profits fell 3.2 percent and sales declined 11 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The company hinted that layoffs were coming late last year when  
the drug maker took an after-tax charge of $240 million to 
restructure operations, but details were not made public until this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of AHP rose 6 1/4 cents to $65.81 1/4 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Baldwin To Start for White Sox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The decision on an opening day starter for  
the Chicago White Sox turned out not to so tough. 
</P>
<P>
	James Baldwin, whose 10-3 record in the second half last season  
was one of the best in the majors, will start opening day in part 
because left-hander Mike Sirotka is experiencing a ``dead arm,'' 
manager Jerry Manuel said Tuesday. Sirotka would start the second 
game of the season if his arm is better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike looks like his arm is a little tired, a little fatigued,  
so we'd rather be cautious,'' Manuel said before the White Sox 
played Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Sirotka was scheduled to pitch Wednesday in Chicago's exhibition  
home finale, but Manuel said he might be scratched to give him some 
extra rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do (pitch him), it'll be a very short stint,'' Manuel  
said. ``The more time we can give him, the better he'll feel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sirotka, who led the White Sox in victories last season with 14,  
probably would have beat out Baldwin for the opening day start 
based on their performances this spring. Baldwin, who was pitching 
against the Rockies, is 1-1 with a 5.40 ERA, while Sirotka is 3-0 
with a 3.18 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	But the White Sox don't want to take any chances with Sirotka.  
There have already been enough serious injuries to pitchers this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be real, real careful,'' Manuel said. ``We don't  
want to push him at all or rush him.''

<HEADLINE> Another Milestone for Gretzky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky has achieved some 60-odd records  
during his 21-year hockey career. And this latest milestone could 
stand a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	``This obviously is going to be a tough record for anybody to  
break,'' Gretzky said of his 1,072 career goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky overtook Gordie Howe when he scored the game-winning  
goal Monday night in the New York Rangers' 3-1 victory over the New 
York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	The staggering total, accumulated during 20 NHL seasons and one  
in the WHA, includes regular-season and playoff goals. Howe scored 
his total during his 26 years in the NHL and WHA. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky's latest achievement is not considered a record by the  
NHL because the league does not recognize the WHA. However, it 
remains very much a record in Gretzky's mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it won't be in the books,'' Gretzky said, ``but people  
will sit around and talk about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was yet another piece of hockey history Gretzky has stolen  
from Howe. Gretzky has long since broken Howe's NHL record of 801 
goals for the regular season. Gretzky now has 894. 
</P>
<P>
	Although called ``The Great One,'' Gretzky still thinks that  
nickname should belong to Howe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gordie is one of the classiest people the game could ever  
have,'' Gretzky said. ``I've always said he's the best player to 
ever play the game. He's my idol.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky had 56 goals in the WHA with Indianapolis and Edmonton  
to go along with his overall total of 1,016 in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Howe had 174 regular-season goals in the WHA with the Houston  
Aeros and New England Whalers. In the postseason he had 28 goals, 
20 with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky tied Howe's mark when he scored his 1,071st against  
Vancouver on Feb. 4. Then he suddenly went dry and went on the 
injury list, missing 12 games with a disc injury in his neck. Along 
with that, he went without a goal in 11 other games. 
</P>
<P>
	So Monday night's goal was a relief for Gretzky. At the same  
time, it helped the Rangers in the playoff race. They moved five 
points behind Boston for the eighth and final spot in the Eastern 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a nice goal at nice time,'' Gretzky said.  
</P>
<P>
	It was only the ninth goal of the season for Gretzky, who once  
scored a record 92 one year with the Edmonton Oilers. And Gretzky 
thinks that's one of his records that is still assailable. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got 92 goals, there was a stretch of a few games there  
where I didn't score,'' Gretzky said. ``(Philadelphia's Eric) 
Lindros and (Pittsburgh's Jaromir) Jagr, they have a shot at the 
92. Everything has to go right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky remembers when he first started out as pro, with  
Indianapolis at age 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just happy to be playing hockey professionally,''  
Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
	His first goal?  
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't very pretty,'' he recalled. ``It was just a backhand  
from the slot on a 2-on-2.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, 1,071 goals and 20 seasons later, Gretzky stands alone.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Decline: Dow Is Off 93.52 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average retreated from  
10,000 Tuesday as technology stocks held on to early gains but 
Coca-Cola dropped sharply on a disappointing sales forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke put a swift end to the Dow 10,000 party when it warned late  
Monday that first-quarter sales would be soft. Dow technology 
components including IBM stepped into the breach to minimize the 
losses, but it wasn't enough to keep the blue chips in positive 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow fell 93.52 to 9,913.26, having trimmed an earlier  
132-point loss. The 103-year blue-chip index took a breather after 
Monday's session, when it made its first close above 10,000, rising 
184.54 to 10,006.78. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, the 10,000 euphoria is wearing a little thin right at  
the moment,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment officer at 
BankBoston, who said he was concerned that the market was showing 
signs of tired leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's getting too monotonous and too old,'' with standard  
performers like technology and health care stocks again carrying 
the market's load, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite strength in technology shares, broader stock indicators  
fell. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 9.42 at 1,300.75 and 
the Nasdaq composite index fell 12.55 to 2,480.29. 
</P>
<P>
	Blaming worldwide economic problems, Coke projected a 1 percent  
to 2 percent first-quarter decline in shipment volume. The company 
usually meets annual growth targets of 7 percent to 8 percent. Coke 
stock dropped 1 5/8 to 63 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke's story illustrated the market's vulnerability to worldwide  
economic problems that are hindering corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the company made its announcement earlier on Monday, it  
would have been enough to prevent the Dow from closing above 
10,000. At 4 p.m. Monday, Coke shares were up 1 7/8 at 67 3/8. After the 
announcement, it gave that gain back in after-hours trading and 
ended the day down 1/2. The total loss Monday of 2 3/8 is the equivalent 
of more than 10 points on the Dow, or enough to have left the 
blue-chip index below 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris also brought the Dow lower. The company's stock  
fell 3 7/32 to 37 3/4 after an Oregon jury ordered the cigarette maker 
to pay $81 million to the family of a man who died of lung cancer 
after smoking Marlboros for four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's losses were mitigated by a strong performance in  
technology shares, especially Internet-related stocks. AOL rose 12 1/8 
to 144 1/2. Dow component IBM climbed 11/16 to 178 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks eased with crude prices, pushing Exxon, another Dow  
stock, down 1 11/16 to 71 5/16. But lower oil prices helped push 
airline stocks higher. US Airways Group climbed 3 5/16 to 49 13/16, 
after the airline said it would meet analysts' first-quarter 
estimates of 46 cents a share. The Dow Jones transportation index 
surged 2.23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues had a slim lead  
over advancers. Consolidated New York Stock Exchange volume was 
moderately heavy at 890.35 million shares, down from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks drew little support from the bond market, where prices  
rose and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.58 
percent from 5.64 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds gained after the Federal Reserve left short-term interest  
rates unchanged at a policy-making meeting. Analysts said that 
while the Fed took no action, there is concern the central bank 
will tighten its credit policy in the near future because of the 
economy's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 4.51 to 608.65, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 6.25 to 711.63. The Russell 
2000 index, which reflects the performance of smaller companies, 
fell 0.98 to 398.78. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.94 percent.  
European stock markets were mixed after the European Commission cut 
its forecast for economic growth this year by almost a half 
percentage point to 2.2 percent. Germany's DAX index was down 0.41 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.18 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 was down 0.28 percent.

<HEADLINE> OK Subway Conductors, say `Please' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York's subway conductors will be allowed to  
keep saying the magic word. 
</P>
<P>
	The city transit agency decided Tuesday that it doesn't take too  
long, after all, to say ``please'' before asking riders to ``stand 
clear of the closing doors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the agency said conductors could help speed  
train service, and save five seconds at every stop, by dropping the 
word ``please.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the idea didn't sit well with riders and commuter advocates  
who insisted there is always enough time to be polite. Transit 
officials were forced to quickly admit that the idea was silly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still going to come up with a way to make the  
announcements more concise but without making them less polite,'' 
transit spokesman Al O'Leary said.

<HEADLINE> Companies Reap 'Melissa' Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The insidious Melissa computer virus has  
been bad news for almost everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Except antivirus software companies.  
</P>
<P>
	``A major outbreak of any virus, especially when it receives  
extensive coverage like Melissa, is going to be good for the 
antivirus business,'' said International Data Corp. researcher 
Chris Christiansen. 
</P>
<P>
	The new computer virus spread quickly across the Internet over  
the weekend, paralyzing corporate e-mail systems by getting into 
users' e-mail address books and sending infected messages to 
everyone in them. 
</P>
<P>
	By Tuesday, several variations were popping up in personal  
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Antivirus software -- known in the industry as a ``vaccine'' --  
detects the presence of a computer virus in a system by checking 
for unusual attempts to access disk areas and system files. It also 
searches for specific viruses. Most computers used in businesses 
and homes are equipped with the software. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Melissa is a new virus, it slipped past existing antivirus  
software. Developers had to rush to update their products and get 
them out to the public once the virus became known. 
</P>
<P>
	An antivirus system for a personal computer typically costs  
around $50. Corporate systems can cost about $15 per machine, 
amounting to thousands of dollars for companies with lots of 
computers. Updates generally cost about $3 per seat, although most 
Melissa patches are being offered for free. 
</P>
<P>
	Antivirus software sales reached $1.3 billion last year,  
according to IDC, up from $915 million in 1997 and $430 million in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Gartner Group research analyst Arabella Hallawell said a virus  
like Melissa pushes technical advances at the antivirus companies 
as well as spurring sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``The onus is on the vendors now to figure out ways to react  
quickly to viruses like Melissa -- alert customers and update and 
distribute the fix,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The top antivirus vendors -- Network Associates Inc. of Santa  
Clara, Calif., and Symantec of Cupertino, Calif. -- reacted swiftly 
to the Melissa virus, setting up emergency response teams, tracking 
the origins in their laboratories and monitoring the mutations. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies were also pitching dozens of antivirus software  
systems with reassuring names like Guard Dog, VirusScan, ViruSafe, 
Sweep, eSafe Protect, and PC-cillin, using the Internet to tie the 
products into news about Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
	``When there's a high-profile virus outbreak, it's really  
another chance for us to inform people that they need to be careful 
and that antivirus software is insurance,'' said Steve Trilling, 
Symantec's antivirus research director. ``You need to pay to 
protect your data.''

<HEADLINE> ADM Tapes Available for Civil Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- A federal judge has ruled that some of the  
tape recordings barred in the criminal price-fixing case against 
executives of Archer Daniels Midland Co. can be released to 
attorneys for possible use in the civil case. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Michael Mihm ruled last week that tapes made  
secretly by former ADM vice president Mark Whitacre can be 
subpoenaed by plaintiffs in the case, but excluded recorded 
telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes, made over two and a half years, contain conversations  
of executives discussing business practices. Lawyers for several 
food companies and soft drink bottlers that buy high-fructose corn 
syrup, a sweetener, want the tapes introduced as evidence to show a 
pattern of price fixing. 
</P>
<P>
	Those customers of ADM and its competitors in the corn syrup  
market allege they were harmed by price fixing. They are plaintiffs 
in more than two dozen class-action lawsuits being heard by Mihm. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies are seeking damages from grain processors  
including ADM and A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co., Cargill Inc. and 
American Maize Products Co. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, ADM agreed to pay a $100 million fine after pleading  
guilty to price-fixing involving lysine and citric acid. 
</P>
<P>
	In a criminal trial last year, Michael Andreas, the son of ADM  
Chairman Emeritus Dwayne Andreas, was convicted of conspiracy price 
fixing along with Terrance Wilson, former head of ADM's corn 
division. They have yet to be sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitacre is serving a nine-year sentence for swindling ADM out  
of $9 million and stashing the money in foreign accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	A trial date has not been set for the civil cases.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Senate Standoff Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- A sometimes comic power struggle that  
brought the Alabama Senate to a standstill for nearly a month ended 
Tuesday, leaving the lieutenant governor free once more to go the 
bathroom without being afraid he will be stripped of his duties 
while he's gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a compromise reached before dawn, Steve Windom, Alabama's  
first Republican lieutenant governor this century, regained some -- 
but not all -- of the traditional powers exercised by his Democratic 
predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to have a great four years now,'' Windom  
declared. 
</P>
<P>
	But it came at a high price, both for Windom and for an Alabama  
Statehouse that fell into slapstick turmoil just when Republicans 
were celebrating the return of two-party politics and Democrats 
were trumpeting the election of the state's first ``New South'' 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
	The turmoil began even before Windom took office, when  
Democratic Gov.-elect Don Siegelman and the majority of Democrats 
in the Senate stripped Windom of nearly all his powers, including 
the authority to appoint committees and decide which committee 
considers which bill. On Windom's first day on March 2, he snatched 
back his powers by gaveling through new rules over howls of protest 
from the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats responded with a boycott that used up one-third of  
the Legislature's meeting days and prevented any bills from being 
considered, including the governor's centerpiece plan to enact a 
lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman's allies then kept the Senate meeting in marathon  
sessions, forcing Windom to urinate in a jug under his podium on 
Sunday because he feared being replaced as presiding officer if he 
left even briefly. 
</P>
<P>
	During the furor, Windom was subjected to threats of impeachment  
and accusations of criminal wrongdoing. At one point, the executive 
director of the Alabama GOP demanded Siegelman resign ``to prevent 
further embarrassment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, nobody resigned or got impeached. But the fight --  
unlike any other in a state known for political antics and the 
noisy campaign dramas of George Wallace -- left a widespread feeling 
of disgust. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have simply gone crazy,'' The Birmingham News declared in  
an editorial Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the House, embarrassed by the upper chamber, printed  
buttons saying, ``I'm in the House. I work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama's post-World War II image has been drawn not just by  
Wallace but by the colorful and at times boozy antics of Gov. James 
E. ``Big Jim'' Folsom, the ouster of preacher-farmer Gov. Guy Hunt 
and the states' rights rhetoric of Gov. Fob James, who lost to 
Siegleman last year. 
</P>
<P>
	With the victory of Siegelman, who got his law degree at  
Georgetown and campaigned in 1972 for George McGovern, the 
progressive faction of the Democratic Party looked for Alabama to 
join other Southern states trying to put prosperity ahead of 
divisive politics. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Republicans, who are now gaining statewide offices and  
legislative seats where Democrats once dominated, looked to Windom 
for political balance in the statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise, approved 31-1 shortly before 4 a.m. Tuesday,  
``will allow us to get back to the business of the people,'' 
Siegelman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the compromise requires Windom and the  
Democratic Senate president pro tem to work together on deciding 
which committee will consider each bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side could claim victory.  
</P>
<P>
	``Both sides are losing,'' Brad Moody, a political scientist at  
Auburn University at Montgomery, said prior to the deal. ``To the 
public, this looks like a bunch of politicians more interested in 
their power and status than addressing the problems the state 
has.''

<HEADLINE> Japan: Spy Ships Were North Korean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan said it will lodge a formal protest with  
North Korea after accusing the reclusive communist state today of 
sending a pair of spy ships into Japanese territorial waters last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	While Tokyo had previously noted the two ships fled toward North  
Korea after ignoring orders to stop, the announcement marked the 
first public statement confirming speculation they were from North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government has determined that the vessels were North  
Korean spy ships,'' said Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka, the 
government's top spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Japanese diplomatic missions in Beijing and New  
York have been instructed to deliver a protest to North Korea, 
Nonaka said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two neighboring countries have no diplomatic relations.  
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo has been unhappy with Pyonyang's response to a demand that  
it turn over the unidentified ships, both of which bore false 
Japanese names. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea says it had nothing to do with the incursion and has  
accused Japan of fabricating the incident to rally parliamentary 
support for new bills aimed at increasing Japan's regional military 
role. 
</P>
<P>
	But Japanese officials say they will continue pressing for the  
return of the ships. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are seeking a response through different channels, but the  
reaction from North Korea has been far from sincere, far from 
satisfactory,'' said Akitaka Saiki, a spokesman for the prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
	The boats were spotted off Japan's western coast early last week  
and were chased through Japanese waters for about 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Their refusal to halt led to the firing of warning shots -- the  
first since 1953 -- and a Cabinet decision to send in naval 
destroyers for their first maritime pursuit in the post-World War 
II era. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident came days after Japan's Parliament began debate on  
bills to bolster the country's military alliance with the United 
States. Ruling party officials have said the incursion demonstrates 
the need for quick passage of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Saiki said the government had no intention of letting it affect  
the current debate, but added that ``this incident certainly 
elevated the awareness for national security among Japanese 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's constitution bans it from using force to settle  
international disputes, but the government has interpreted that 
loosely to allow armed forces for defensive purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The confrontation has sparked calls for revisions to Japan's  
Self-Defense Forces Law to better prepare the country for a 
military attack.

<HEADLINE> How Garth Brooks Fared on Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- How it went for Garth Brooks on Tuesday at  
spring training for the San Diego Padres: 
</P>
<P>
	 *COUNTRY CAMPER:* Brooks pinch-hit for starter Andy Ashby in the  
bottom of the seventh and hit a broken-bat, one-hopper to shortstop 
Lou Collier, dropping his average to .053 ( 1-for-19) in official 
spring games. He stayed in the game in left field, but didn't have 
any chances. 
</P>
<P>
	 *HIGH NOTE:* Brooks at least got the ball to an infielder. In  
his previous four spring at-bats, he had two strikeouts and two 
little tappers that the catcher fielded and threw him out. 
</P>
<P>
	 *ON THE RECORD:* ``Well, I got some extra work in and at least I  
hit the ball past the catcher this time,'' said Brooks, who took 
extra batting practice on a side field before the game.

<HEADLINE> McCain To Offer Internet Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate's top telecommunications lawmaker  
pledged Tuesday to offer legislation that would prevent the Federal 
Communications Commission from regulating the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard has said the agency has no intention  
of either regulating the Internet or doing anything that would lead 
to higher charges for computer users to access the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate  
Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the FCC, said he 
will introduce legislation in April that would bar the FCC from 
adopting any rule changes that would increase consumers' charges to 
tap into the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would make sure that local telephone companies  
have incentives to offer high-speed connections to the Internet and 
prohibiting the FCC from forcing telephone companies to sell the 
services to other companies.

<HEADLINE> Starr Witness Steele Will Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Prosecutors of a criminal case against  
Whitewater figure Susan McDougal were stunned by a judge's decision 
to allow testimony from a Virginia woman who claims, as Mrs. 
McDougal does, that she was mistreated by Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Now in its fourth week, the trial took a dramatic turn Tuesday  
when U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. heard testimony from 
Julie Hiatt Steele of Richmond, Va. He then granted a defense 
request that Ms. Steele be allowed to tell her story to the jury 
that will decide Mrs. McDougal's guilt or innocence on criminal 
contempt and obstruction of justice charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is mammoth,'' said Associate Independent Counsel Mark  
Barrett after rising from his chair to address the judge about the 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courthouse, Barrett said, ``I think we've been on  
the defense since the defense case began, but this is a different 
level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele faces a May 3 trial in Alexandria, Va., charged by  
Starr's office with three counts of obstruction of justice and one 
count of making false statements in the probe involving President 
Clinton and Kathleen Willey, a former White House volunteer. Mrs. 
Willey alleges Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance in 1993. Ms. 
Steele says she was asked by Mrs. Willey to tell a lie that 
supported the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony before Howard, Ms. Steele said she gave accurate  
information to the FBI and before the federal grand jury last year 
about Mrs. Willey but nevertheless was indicted. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Starr's prosecutors also questioned her brother, one of  
her daughters, her accountant and her neighbors and friends before 
she was indicted. She also suspected Starr's office investigated 
her adoption of her son, now 8, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett and a fellow prosecutor, Julie Myers, argued against Ms.  
Steele's testimony. They contended that it would create ``a 
minitrial'' in the trial against Mrs. McDougal and exceeds the 
court's previous order barring the defense from using evidence from 
other investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	They asked for time to file written arguments, but the judge  
said he had heard enough arguments. They asked for a continuance of 
the trial until Monday so they could get ``up to speed'' on the 
case that Starr's office brought against Ms. Steele. The judge said 
no. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (the defense lawyer) is simply presenting this to the jury  
to show modus operandi,'' Howard told prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele is to testify before the jury Friday. In the  
meantime, Mrs. McDougal finished five days on the witness stand, 
and the defense is calling other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal testified that her late ex-husband, James  
McDougal, told her to cooperate with Starr's office and tell a lie 
that she had a sexual affair with Clinton. Mrs. McDougal said she 
did not discuss sex in an ABC television interview, shown to the 
jury, because it was personal. She said Tuesday, after court, that 
she did not have a sexual affair with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courthouse, Barrett complained that Mrs. McDougal  
has been attacking Starr's office as her defense to the criminal 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal says she refused to answer federal grand jury  
questions in 1996 and 1998 about her former business partners, the 
Clintons, because she feared Starr would charge her with perjury if 
she didn't say what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett noted the judge has allowed limited testimony from  
Whitewater defendant Steve Smith and a lawyer for a former McDougal 
employee regarding their treatment by Starr's prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	But Barrett said Ms. Steele's testimony was different: It  
relates to incidents that occurred after Mrs. McDougal's alleged 
crimes, it relates to investigations outside the McDougal 
investigation, and it is offered as evidence of prosecutorial 
misconduct and not as evidence of what Mrs. McDougal thought before 
refusing to answer the grand jury questions.

<HEADLINE> Report: Metal Co. Withheld Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- The nation's largest supplier of beryllium --  
a metal vital to the defense industry -- withheld evidence for more 
than 20 years showing exposure to the material could sicken workers 
even when the federal safety limit was met, The Blade reported 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1940s, hundreds of workers exposed to the metal dust  
at weapons plants have contracted beryllium disease, a sometimes 
fatal lung illness. Government officials knew about the danger but 
allowed continued exposure at defense plants, the newspaper 
reported in a six-part series that began Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The metal is used in missiles, bombs and jet fighters.  
</P>
<P>
	Brush Wellman Inc., based in Cleveland, played down the risks of  
beryllium, the newspaper said. One instructional video compared the 
risks of working at Brush with hiking in the woods, where ``there 
may be a few hidden hazards along the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beryllium disease has contributed to the deaths of at least 32  
Brush workers and neighbors since the 1940s, the Blade said, citing 
industry records and death certificates. 
</P>
<P>
	Brush Wellman was told in 1974 by NGK Insulators of Japan that  
its workers had developed beryllium disease at exposures below the 
U.S. safety limit 
</P>
<P>
	``This is shocking to me that they had this information,'' said  
Dr. Peter Infante, director of standards review at the U.S. 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years later, Brush officials testified at federal hearings  
that the existing limit clearly protected workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has ``proven beyond a doubt'' that the federal limit  
``is completely safe'' in terms of preventing disease, wrote Martin 
Powers, a now-retired Brush executive. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the newspaper that some statements were ``probably a  
little too dogmatic and definitive for the state of knowledge at 
the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Current officials of Brush Wellman, which has plants in five  
countries and 11 states, acknowledged that they had never 
consistently kept exposures under the federal limit at the 
company's largest plant, in Elmore, near Toledo, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Hanes, the company's vice president for government affairs,  
said Tuesday the company would not comment further until the 
newspaper series is finished.

<HEADLINE> Moncrief Is Ark.-Little Rock Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Sidney Moncrief was hired today as the  
basketball coach at Arkansas-Little Rock, returning to the state 
where he led the Razorbacks to the 1978 Final Four before going on 
to star in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Moncrief, who owns an automobile dealership in suburban Little  
Rock, has never coached before. He replaces Wimp Sanderson, who 
resigned March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The school announced his hiring at an afternoon news conference  
at the Little Rock River Market, across the Arkansas River from the 
new arena in which UALR will play next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very good opportunity to build on a program that has  
done very well in the past,'' Moncrief said. ``This is a great 
program to sell to young people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can think of no better place to coach than in the city and  
state that I am from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UALR athletic director Rick Mello said Moncrief was the top  
candidate for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	UALR, a member of the Sun Belt Conference, went 12-15 last  
season. Moncrief's reputation and state connections are expected to 
be a big help in recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't be more thrilled to have Sidney Moncrief as our  
basketball coach,'' Mello said. ``We were extremely pleased with 
the quality of people who showed interest in the position, but to 
end up with Sidney Moncrief exceeds all of our expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moncrief, who played under former Arkansas coach Eddie Sutton,  
is the second-leading career scorer and top rebounder with the 
Razorbacks. He spent 10 seasons in the NBA with the Milwaukee Bucks 
and one season with the Atlanta Hawks.

<HEADLINE> A's Trade Witasick to Royals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Oakland Athletics traded right-handed pitcher  
Jay Witasick to the Kansas City Royals on Tuesday for a player to 
be named and cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Witasick, competing for a spot in the starting rotation, was 1-0  
with a 7.63 ERA in five games this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me it's a positive,'' said Witasick, who learned of the  
trade during the A's game against the Anaheim Angels. ``It gives me 
a good chance to pitch. I came into camp shooting for a starting 
job, but people stepped up and left me as a bullpen candidate. If I 
get innings from another team, it obviously benefits me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Witasick, who is 2-4 in 27 major league games, all with the A's,  
lost the fifth spot in the rotation to Brad Rigby. 
</P>
<P>
	In another move Tuesday, the A's claimed left handed pitcher Ron  
Mahay on waivers from the Boston Red Sox. Mahay was 1-1 with a 6.48 
ERA in eight games this spring. He's appeared in 57 major league 
games, all in relief, and is 4-1 with a save.

<HEADLINE> China Businessman Eyes Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- Lawrence Cheung wants to bring the  
Internet into Chinese living rooms. But first, he has to give the 
Chinese people a reason and a way to log on. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of Web sites are in English, a language most  
Chinese don't speak. And few homes in China have computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheung's answer is Shanghai WebTV, a company that is creating  
Chinese Web sites for Internet novices to surf using only a TV set, 
a joystick and a button. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people want to get on the Net but they say, `I can't  
use a computer; I can't read English.' I want to bridge that gap,'' 
said Cheung, 31, who left the Hong Kong branch of the J. Walter 
Thompson advertising agency to start Shanghai WebTVwith two 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheung's firm is one of many companies -- small startups and  
established giants like Microsoft -- that are trying to eliminate 
technical, language and political barriers and grab a share of the 
Internet market in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	That market is expected to boom in the coming years. Chinese  
leaders are encouraging Internet use as a tool for building the 
high-tech industry. Internet cafes, where customers can buy time on 
a terminal, are common in major cities. State-owned China Telecom 
cut access rates in half recently to encourage use and spur 
innovation. 
</P>
<P>
	There are obstacles to be overcome. The communist government  
remains wary of the potential for the Internet to spread dissent 
and wants to protect its infant information industry from foreign 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, China's population of Internet users grew fourfold last  
year to 2.1 million. Another 1.5 million are expected to sign up 
this year. Personal computer sales grew 14 percent last year to 
40.5 billion yuan, the equivalent of $4.9 billion, according to the 
consulting firm International Data Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this trend continues, it's very likely that China will be  
the second-largest market in the world in a few years,'' said Jim 
Jarrett, president of U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp.'s China division. 
</P>
<P>
	Access to that promising market for foreign companies is  
slighter easier since regulators allowed a handful of joint 
ventures such as Shanghai WebTV, whose Chinese partner is a 
Shanghai city government agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In the biggest deal, Microsoft and China Telecom, which runs  
China's main online network, said they will launch a TV-based 
Internet service that could reach millions of users. Microsoft says 
equipment should go on sale later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	A TV-based system has obvious appeal in China. The 9,000 yuan,  
or $1,100, price of a basic PC is far above the national average 
income of 6,500 yuan, or $785, a year. By contrast, Shanghai 
WebTVsays its receivers could cost as little as 1,500 yuan, or 
$180. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard Co. and other industry leaders  
have research labs in China, in part to tailor products for Chinese 
needs. In Shanghai, 150 Intel researchers are trying to perfect 
technology to make computers respond to spoken commands. 
</P>
<P>
	``In China, I think it's much better if we can talk to a  
computer rather than use a keyboard, which is not natural for a 
Chinese,'' said Albert Yu, the Shanghai-born senior vice president 
of Intel. 
</P>
<P>
	China has an Internet search engine, online shopping for books  
and stocks and Web sites for soccer teams, newspapers and 
government agencies -- all in Chinese. Dialing a three-digit phone 
number anywhere nationwide connects users to the local node of the 
China Telecom network. 
</P>
<P>
	The system is far from perfect. Users complain about high access  
fees and poor service at many of China's more than 200 local 
Internet service providers. Sites regarded as pornographic or 
politically dangerous are blocked. 
</P>
<P>
	But the biggest complaint is language. In a government survey in  
December, 20 percent of users said the Internet had too little 
Chinese-language material. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanghai WebTV's offerings include sports, interactive games,  
stock market information and English lessons. 
</P>
<P>
	The company WebTVhas China's first license for e-commerce, such  
as online shopping, Cheung said, but he is reluctant to use it 
until the undeveloped Chinese delivery industry can guarantee 
buyers will get the goods. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't clear, anyway, whether China is ready for online  
shopping. Credit cards are rare, and 75 percent of Net users have 
family incomes below 2,000 yuan, or $250 a month, the government 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first stage is to get to know foreign technology. The next  
is to adapt it to Chinese characteristics. We haven't reached that 
point yet,'' Cheung said.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Snake Fence Must Come Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (AP) -- A judge on Tuesday ordered a mining  
company to tear down a fence that state environmental officials say 
is a threat to a den of rare rattlesnakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling from Dutchess County Supreme Court Justice Judith  
Hillery requires the Sour Mountain Realty Co. to remove the 4-foot, 
wire-mesh fence in Fishkill by Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sour Mountain Inc., owner Jay Montfort said he will appeal  
the decision, and will not take down the fence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's important enough that it's worth getting arrested  
over,'' Montfort said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``snake-proof'' fence was installed in February, about 260  
feet from a den of timber rattlesnakes on Montfort's property. In 
court papers, the state Department of Environmental Conservation 
said the fence was illegal because it would reduce the snakes' 
habitat by about 20 percent and perhaps cause ``physiological 
stress'' to the animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's decision was the first time a state court has ruled on  
New York's endangered species law.

<HEADLINE> Okla. Files Charges Against Nichols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Oklahoma City bombing conspirator Terry  
Nichols, already serving a life prison term in federal prison, has 
been charged with 160 counts of murder by state prosecutors who 
have vowed to seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not satisfied with the outcome of the Nichols trial,''  
District Attorney Bob Macy said Monday after filing a 56-page 
document outlining the charges. ``I feel like he needs to be tried 
before an Oklahoma jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols, 43, is in prison for conspiracy and the deaths of eight  
law enforcement officers in the April 19, 1995 bombing of the 
Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Hundreds were injured and 168 
people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Macy also accused Nichols of one count of first-degree  
manslaughter for the death of an unborn child whose mother died in 
the bombing, one count of conspiracy to commit murder and one count 
of aiding and counseling in the placing of a substance or bomb near 
a public building. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will take a year to get to trial. It's a very complex  
trial,'' Macy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Macy predicted a series of legal challenges to trying Nichols in  
Oklahoma, including a request for a change of venue from Oklahoma 
County. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor said it is unclear when Nichols will be brought  
to Oklahoma from a federal prison near Florence, Colo. Nichols was 
convicted in federal court in Denver on Dec. 23, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Macy has also promised a state trial for convicted bomber  
Timothy McVeigh, but he has said he would try Nichols first and 
wait to see how McVeigh fares in the appeal of his federal death 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols was at his home in Herington, Kan., the day the bomb  
exploded. Federal prosecutors accused him of helping McVeigh 
deliver a getaway car to Oklahoma City three days before the 
bombing and of working with McVeigh to pack the bomb inside a Ryder 
truck on the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	They also introduced evidence that Nichols used an alias to buy  
two tons of explosive fertilizer and helped McVeigh steal 
explosives from a rock quarry. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also contended in the federal trial that Nichols  
robbed Arkansas gun collector Roger Moore to raise money to live on 
while the men prepared for the bombing.

<HEADLINE> Terry Nichols Faces State Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Any state trial of convicted Oklahoma City  
bombing conspirator Terry Nichols will likely include a judge and 
jury from outside Oklahoma County. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Bob Macy said meetings were held Tuesday to  
discuss finding a judge to oversee the case. District Judge Dan 
Owens earlier said he intends to ask the state Supreme Court to 
appoint someone from outside the county to avoid ``the appearance 
of impropriety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Macy said the 160 murder charges -- one for each bombing victim --  
filed Monday against Nichols are on hold until a judge is found. 
</P>
<P>
	``That will be a big step,'' he said. ``Once a judge is  
appointed he can go ahead and appoint defense counsel and then we 
can sit down and see if there are things we can agree on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols, 43, could face the death penalty if convicted in state  
court. He already is serving a life sentence after being convicted 
in the deaths of eight law officers who died in the April 19, 1995, 
bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal jurors in Denver convicted Nichols on Dec. 23, 1997, for  
conspiring to bomb the building and eight counts of involuntary 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Bomber Timothy McVeigh was convicted by a separate federal jury  
in Denver and sentenced to die.

<HEADLINE> Rehnquist Plea Ignored by Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist is urging  
Congress ``in the strongest terms possible'' to free the federal 
court system from a spending fight over how to conduct the 2000 
census. But his words have gone unheeded so far. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee's leaders,  
Rehnquist said the political battle threatens ``every sector of the 
judicial branch ... including probation and pretrial services 
officers who supervise 120,000 released criminals and those accused 
of crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of Rehnquist's March 17 letter to Sen. Orrin Hatch,  
R-Utah, the committee chairman, and ranking Democrat Patrick Leahy 
of Vermont, was released today by federal court officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court ruled in January that the government cannot  
adjust the 2000 census to enhance its accuracy for deciding how 
many members of Congress each state should have. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the government can use adjusted census numbers to draw  
election districts and hand out $180 billion in annual federal aid. 
The current fight in Congress is over whether to pay for creating a 
second set of census figures for those purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	That battle is tying up congressional approval of spending not  
only for the Commerce Department, home of the Census Bureau, but 
also for the Justice and State Departments and the federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The judicial branch should not, and does not, have any role in  
this debate, as the resolution of this issue very properly rests 
with the political branches of government,'' Rehnquist's letter 
said. ``The judiciary's appropriation should, therefore, also be 
free from entanglement in this political dispute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His letter added: ``Respect for a separate and coequal branch of  
government suggests that the judiciary be assured it can continue 
its full level of operations at the funding level already 
approved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist noted that during a similar funding battle in 1996,  
Congress took special action to unfreeze the money needed for 
running the federal court system. ``In the same spirit which has 
motivated that action, I urge in the strongest possible terms that 
funding for the judiciary quickly be made available for the 
remainder of this fiscal year.''

<HEADLINE> Cybersleuth Links Teen to Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- As a boy growing up in the '60s, Richard  
Smith loved reading books about FBI agents tracking down criminals 
by matching typed letters with typewriters. 
</P>
<P>
	Now as a software company president, he may have accomplished  
the cyberspace equivalent. Smith has found clues linking a teen-age 
boy with the creation of ``Melissa,'' the fastest spreading 
computer virus in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I did was poke around,'' said the mild-mannered Smith,  
45, from his offices on the second-floor of a brick building in a 
nondescript section of Cambridge, home to Harvard, M.I.T and some 
of the world's top computer scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	What Smith did was find clues to the identity of the programmer  
or programmers who launched the virus, as well as evidence that 
could lead to the computer that wrote the program. He has turned 
that information over to the FBI, which is investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa, a virus that acts like an electronic chain letter,  
clogged or crippled the e-mail systems of thousands of companies 
and government offices starting last Friday. It comes to victims 
disguised as an e-mail from a friend, with a note saying that an 
important document is attached. Once the victim opens up the 
document, the virus digs into the computer's address book and sends 
the same e-mail to the first 50 names it finds. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith believes Melissa's author, or one of them, is a teen-age  
boy with a record of virus writing who uses the computer handle 
``VicodinES,'' which is the name of a narcotic painkiller. 
</P>
<P>
	The youth is suspected of stealing an America Online password  
and using the account to spread at least three viruses since 
December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The hacker, who Smith calls ``the Vicodin guy,'' is motivated by  
equal parts malice and a fascination with how things work, Smith 
speculates. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a curiosity he himself has harbored since his own high  
school years, when he took night computer classes at the University 
of Florida at Gainesville with his father. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith majored in computer science at North Carolina State when  
the discipline was still young in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's president of Phar Lap Software, a company he cofounded  
in 1986 that develops computer operating systems for ATMs, slot 
machines and medical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding clues to the Melissa virus programmers is the third in a  
remarkable string of recent discoveries Smith has made by just 
poking around with his laptop. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months ago, he discovered a Microsoft bug that will prevent  
some of the company's software applications from recognizing 
daylight savings time for a week. 
</P>
<P>
	One month ago he caught the world's attention when he identified  
a secret serial number -- a digital fingerprint -- left on every 
document file in the popular Microsoft Office package of software 
applications. Smith revealed the company was compiling the serial 
numbers of its users' computers in a database, raising cries of 
outrage from privacy advocates. Microsoft promised to let users 
eliminate the fingerprint. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Smith wondered if the digital fingerprint would  
have any value in tracking down viruses. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, he found out it did.  
</P>
<P>
	Working at his home office in a Boston suburb-- with his wife and  
13-year-old daughter in the same room surfing the Web on their own 
laptops -- Smith noticed a virus alert had been posted. 
</P>
<P>
	The alert said a virus had been e-mailed Friday from an America  
Online account, later discovered to belong to a civil engineer in 
Lynnwood, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith also received an e-mail from a Stockholm University  
student, who pointed out similarities between the work of VicodinES 
and Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1997, the same America Online account had posted a  
similar virus and Smith found digital fingerprints linking 
VicodinES to that virus. 
</P>
<P>
	He further discovered VicodinES had done something more  
dangerous than launch the virus: posting tool kits on a Web site 
that helps people create their own viruses. 
</P>
<P>
	He directed reporters to call the owner of the VicodinES web  
site. One or two reporters have since told him they may have 
actually talked to VicodinES -- and his mom. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Smith hasn't tried contacting VicodinES.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to wait to see what the FBI digs up.''

<HEADLINE> Woman To Give Up Baby After Mix Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A white woman who gave birth to a black child  
after she was accidentally implanted with another couple's embryos 
will surrender the baby to the couple who are believed to be the 
biological parents, her lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna and Richard Fasano will give up the 3-month-old boy  
``because we love him,'' they said Monday in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We both want what's in the best interest of the child,'' Mrs.  
Fasano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Fasano gave birth Dec. 29 to two boys, one black and one  
white. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fasanos decided to raise the white child and allow Robert  
and Deborah Perry Rogers to raise the black child if DNA tests 
confirm that they are his biological parents, said Mrs. Fasano's 
lawyer, Ivan Tantleff. They hope to get visitation rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fasanos have reared, loved and cared for both children as  
their own,'' he said. ``(Mrs. Fasano) doesn't look at them as white 
and black. She looks at them as her sons. She is torn apart by 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rogerses, from Teaneck, N.J., sued over the case, seeking  
custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Court papers said that last April, 71-year-old Dr. Lillian Nash,  
in her Manhattan office, implanted eggs fertilized by their 
husbands in the two women's uteruses. Each couple had tried for 
years to conceive a child but had been unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Rogers did not become pregnant from the procedure. Mrs.  
Fasano, however, became pregnant with twins. 
</P>
<P>
	The mix-up was discovered two weeks into her pregnancy. The  
doctor said several of Mrs. Rogers' embryos, deemed unsuitable for 
storage for use in a future attempt at pregnancy, accidentally were 
implanted in Mrs. Fasano along with her own. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Fasano opted to go ahead with the pregnancy after learning  
the twins were healthy, even though one was not genetically hers, 
Tantleff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Rogers was astonished by the news that the Fasanos would  
relinquish the black child, said her lawyer, Rudolph Silas. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was very excited to hear the good news and overwhelmed  
after so many failed efforts to conceive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fasanos were expected to meet the Rogerses, for the first  
time, in a few days.

<HEADLINE> MTV Names Chief of Online Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Longtime TV producer Fred Seibert has been  
tapped to lead MTV's new online services division. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, MTV Networks Online, was created last month in  
a bid to beef up MTV's presence in cyberspace. It groups together 
the already successful Web sites of MTV, VH1 and Nickelodeon and 
plans to create more Web destinations in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the new projects in the works call for creating a Web  
site especially for kids, with moderated chat rooms, audiovisual 
content from Nickelodeon and an online toy store, and a music 
destination with a customizable online radio feature, concert 
information and music reviews. Both are to be released later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Seibert, who was MTV's original creative director before  
founding a TV production company and running Hanna-Barbera Cartoons 
Inc., said that following MTV's audience into cyberspace was a 
natural progression for the network. 
</P>
<P>
	``MTV networks has avoided stumbling by constantly being in  
touch with its customers,'' Seibert said in an interview Tuesday. 
``As MTV put their foot in the water and got more feedback from the 
audience, we decided it was time for a full immersion in this 
media, the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the venture, MTV's parent company Viacom Inc. is joining  
other media giants like Walt Disney Co., Time Warner Inc. and Sony 
Corp. in an effort to use their music, television and movie 
materials as ways to make money online. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom's other holdings include the Paramount movie studio and  
Spelling Entertainment, which produces hit TV shows such as 
``Melrose Place.'' It also owns the Blockbuster Video rental chain, 
the Simon &AMP; Schuster consumer book publisher and half of the UPN 
television network.
