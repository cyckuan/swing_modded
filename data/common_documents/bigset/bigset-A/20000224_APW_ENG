Santana Wins Record-Tying 8 Grammys
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Carlos Santana, who first gained fame a generation ago
with a searing guitar performance at Woodstock, capped a triumphant comeback
Wednesday with a record-tying eight Grammy Awards. The 52-year-old guitarist's
multi-platinum "Supernatural" won album of the year. His first No. 1 single,
"Smooth," capped a sweep of the major Grammys by winning song and record of the
year. Santana tied Michael Jackson's 1983 record of most Grammys on a single
night. "Music is the vehicle for the magic of healing," he said upon accepting
the album of the year trophy, "and the music of 'Supernatural' was a sign and
designed to bring unity and harmony."

McCain Targets West Coast Voters
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- After winning handily in his home state primary of Arizona
and beating George W. Bush in the Michigan contest, John McCain is turning his
attention to upcoming GOP presidential battles on the West Coast. McCain is
casting the nomination fight as a choice between an inclusive reformer who can
win the White House and a $70 million candidate who appeals mostly to the
establishment. "The great thing about this victory yesterday was that we have
proven -- I hope to my Republican friends and I believe to most Americans --
that we can reassemble a coalition" of bipartisan support in the tradition of
President Reagan, McCain told an overflow crowd at Gonzaga University in
Spokane.

FBI Joining Police Corruption Probe
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The FBI is entering an investigation into Los Angeles
police corruption that has already resulted in twenty police officers being
suspended and 40 criminal convictions being overturned. The investigation began
when a former anti-gang officer accused of stealing cocaine from an evidence
locker began telling prosecutors about fellow officers framing innocent people,
lying in court and attacking suspects. The Los Angeles County district
attorney's office is looking into as many as 3,000 criminal convictions that may
have been tainted by police misconduct.

	   CRESCENT CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Guards shot 13 inmates, killing one, to quell

dangerous criminals. About 200 black and Hispanic inmates with handmade weapons
began fighting in a yard of the highest-security wing of Pelican Bay State
Prison, near the Oregon border, Lt. Ben Grundy said. The violence ended a
half-hour later after guards, who first used tear gas and pepper spray, opened
fire, he said.

Isaias Rodriguez said Wednesday. The issue has been a source of tension between
the two countries: Venezuela says the flights infringe on its sovereignty, while
U.S. officials say they're needed to stem the flow of drugs from neighboring
Colombia, the world's top producer of cocaine.

Summers: Web Shouldn't Be Tax Haven
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It is critically important to keep the Internet from
becoming a tax haven for Web entrepreneurs seeking tax breaks not available to
traditional bricks-and-mortar stores, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said
Wednesday. Summers' comments on the Internet reflect an effort by the
administration to find a middle ground between one group, which includes GOP
presidential candidate John McCain, which has called for the Internet to be
totally tax-free, and state and local government officials who want to tap into
revenues being generated by the fastest-growing part of the economy.

<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A band leader for 50 years and 118 albums to his credit,
Latin legend Tito Puente says he has another accomplishment: role model.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm very honored to be here and I hope I continue to be a role model to all
the young Latin people coming up in this profession," Puente said backstage.
</P>
<P>
	   Puente got his fifth Grammy on Wednesday for best traditional tropical Latin
performance for "Mambo Birdland."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the explosion of Latin music chart-toppers has helped bolster his
own career, which has seen 10 Grammy nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   "Well, it doesn't hurt, but I'm not Ricky Martin, I'm not Marc Anthony --
I'm sure not Jennifer Lopez," said Puente, wiggling his behind in an apparent
reference to the actress and her much-hyped derriere.
</P>
<P>
	   Puente also introduced his son backstage, Tito Puente Jr., who has a music
career of his own. His style is different from his dad's classic tunes -- he
plays house music. He towered over his dad, thanks to thick platform shoes.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Blues guitar master B. B. King, his ninth Grammy in hand, said he has
already made plans for a posthumous career.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've had some friends encourage me to retire and they ask me when I would
and my answer is five to 10 years after I am dead," said the 74-year-old
musician.
</P>
<P>
	   King got his first Grammy in 1970. On Wednesday, he won for best traditional
blues album for "Blues on the Bayou."
</P>
<P>
	   He is working on an album with Eric Clapton.
</P>
<P>
	   "What can I tell you -- I just wish I could do more," King said backstage.
</P>

</P>
<P>
	   Carlos Santana wasn't the only rock elder recognized Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Black Sabbath, a heavy-metal band that came of age in the 1970s, won for
best metal performance for "Iron Man," off the album "Reunion."
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't think that 31 years ago, I'd be standing up in a suit. I feel more
like an accountant than the guy who plays drums in Black Sabbath," said Bill
Ward, whose only sign of being a rocker was multiple earrings adorning his ear.
</P>
<P>
	   He called the recognition of older artists gratifying.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's totally cool," Ward said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	   Crooner Tony Bennett got his ninth Grammy on Wednesday -- a win that the
prolific singer said inspires him to turn out another hit.
</P>
<P>
	   "Boy, I just feel like going back in the recording studio and doing another
one," Bennett said backstage. He won for best traditional pop vocal performance
for his "Bennett Sings Ellington -- Hot &AMP; Cool."
</P>
<P>
	   He wouldn't reveal what project he's working on next, saying he thinks it
"would be lifted by someone else."
</P>
<P>
	   At 73, Bennett says he has no plans to stop singing.
</P>
<P>
	   "I love what I'm doing ... it's such an adventure," he said.

<P>
	   "NYPD Blue" star Dennis Franz says his work for the "Dixie Chicks" made him
feel right at home.
</P>
<P>
	   The country trio asked Franz to play a part in their music video --
broadcast during the Grammys -- for the song "Goodbye Earl."
</P>
<P>
	   When the musicians asked the actor to take part, Franz said they told him
"the character in the video -- he is a pretty nasty fella. And I said, 'I've
done that before, so let's go for it."'
</P>
<P>
	   "The Dixie Chicks" won for best country album for "Fly" and best country
performance by a duo or group with vocal for their hit "Ready to Run."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Rosie O'Donnell, who emceed the show, had fun with the non-musical troubles
of industry stars.
</P>
<P>
	   "Good news everyone, Puff Daddy has left the building," she announced at one
point. "He was in the front row and it's a comfort to me, trust me."
</P>
<P>
	   Puff Daddy, a nickname for the rap artist Sean "Puffy" Combs, was indicted
Wednesday along with a bodyguard on charges of bribing a witness to say he owned
a gun police found as Combs drove from a New York nightclub after a shooting.
Combs also faces gun possession charges in connection with the Dec. 27 shooting.

<HEADLINE> 2nd Death Sentence in Torture Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- A jury that took just 20 minutes to convict a
former grocery store worker in an Arlington woman's torture and slaying
sentenced him to die for the crime Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury rejected defense attorneys' claims that Michael Wayne Hall's life
should be spared because he is mentally impaired. Hall's videotaped confession,
which jurors saw twice during the trial, contradicted the characterization.
</P>
<P>
	   In the tape made after his arrest in March 1998, Hall, 20, was articulate as
he described in detail how he and Robert Neville Jr. lured Amy Robinson, 19,
into their car and later killed her.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was no remorse shown at the time -- just laughter. Doesn't that
speak volumes? This is not about Michael Hall's mental ability, but about his
soul,'' prosecutor Christy Jack told jurors.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said Hall helped Neville, who was convicted in 1998 and
sentenced to die, select the victim and hide the evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   In separate television interviews, Hall and Neville described using the
Robinson for ``target practice,'' shooting her with arrows, a pellet gun and a
rifle, which finally killed her.

    CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Rob Blake and Donald Audette each had a goal and
two assists as the Los Angles Kings scored five third-period goals in a 7-2
victory over Calgary on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>

saw the Kings score five times against Fred Brathwaite in a 7:38 span.
</P>
<P>
	   The last three goals came on power plays as the frustrated Flames took three
consecutive penalties, two by Andrei Nazarov.

<HEADLINE> Michigan Awaits Word on Crawford  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- Michigan's leading scorer Jamal Crawford hasn't yet heard
from the NCAA if he will be eligible to play Thursday night against Purdue.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce Madej, Michigan's director of athletic media relations, said late
Wednesday night the university is still waiting to hear from the NCAA whether
Crawford can play.
</P>
<P>
	   The NCAA initially suspended Crawford, a 6-foot-6 freshman guard, for six
games for violating its rules concerning amateurism, based on his relationship
with a Seattle man he lived with for three years while attending Rainier Beach
High School.
</P>
<P>
	   But the NCAA re-opened its investigation following media reports about
Crawford's relationship with Barry Henthorn.
</P>
<P>
	   The Detroit News reported Thursday that Crawford's college career could be
in jeopardy because of a letter he wrote in May declaring himself eligible for
the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
	   Henthorn told the newspaper that the draft letter has become the central
issue in the NCAA's investigation. The NCAA is considering declaring Crawford
ineligible "forever," Henthorn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Madej told The Associated Press that Michigan officials have discussed the
letters with the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
	   "There has been discussion about the letters, but I don't know what the NCAA
has said or what our discussions have been with the NCAA," he said. "I am
assuming I'm going to hear something about it (Thursday)."
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan Athletic Director Tom Goss and coach Brian Ellerbe did not respond
to requests for an interview, the News reported.
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 16, Ellerbe told the News he knew that Crawford had "checked out the
NBA draft" in the spring.
</P>
<P>
	   "He just wanted to see where he stood," Ellerbe said.
</P>
<P>
	   Crawford wrote the letter believing he could test his value in the NBA
draft, then withdraw, without jeopardizing his collegiate eligibility, Henthorn
said.
</P>
<P>
	   College players can apply for the draft and withdraw once, according to NCAA
rules. The exception does not apply to high school students, NCAA representative
Jane Jankowski said Wednesday. Jankowski was not commenting specifically on the
Crawford case.
</P>
<P>
	   A representative for the NBA, Mark Broussard, confirmed to the newspaper
that Crawford's letter, postmarked May 14, 1999, arrived in league headquarters,
followed six days later by another letter in which Crawford withdrew from the
draft.
</P>
<P>
	   Crawford's May 14 letter to NBA Commissioner David Stern, obtained by The
News, read:
</P>
<P>
	   "This letter is intended to formerly (sic) declare myself, Jamal Crawford,
eligible for the 1999 NBA Draft. I understand that I will have up to one week
prior to the draft to reconsider my position without effecting (sic) my NCAA
eligibility or my ability to declare myself eligible in the future under the
same guidelines."
</P>
<P>
	   Crawford asked that any paperwork from the league be mailed to "my
residence" -- giving the address of Henthorn's multimillion-dollar home in
Edmonds, Wash., a Seattle suburb.

<HEADLINE> McCain surges in New York, but still has uphill battle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A new poll says John McCain is in a dead heat among
Republicans with George W. Bush for New York's GOP-only primary, bringing up
questions of whether the state Republican party can actually deliver the state
for their favored candidate.
<P>
	   "New York is definitely in play for the Republicans," said pollster Lee
Miringoff, head of Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion.
</P>
<P>
	   The Marist poll had Bush favored by 43 percent of Republican voters to 41
percent for McCain. In December, the Texas governor led McCain, 59 percent to 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bush retains the support of most of New York's top Republican leaders,
including New York Gov. George Pataki and state GOP Chairman William Powers,
there are those who say GOP leaders are getting nervous.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not the only one with food-poisoning symptoms in New York state this
morning," said an under-the-weather Jay Severin, a New York-based GOP
consultant. "There's a train coming to New York and the Republican establishment
has only two choices, you can get on it or you get struck by it."
</P>
<P>
	   Even before Tuesday's Michigan and Arizona primaries, there had been signs
of trouble for Bush in New York. On Saturday, U.S. Rep. Peter King of Long
Island switched his allegiance from Bush to McCain. State Assemblymen Joel
Miller of Poughkeepsie and Philip Boyle of Long Island have also joined the
McCain camp in recent days.
</P>
<P>
	   Publicly, state GOP leaders professed little concern Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not nervous," said state Assembly Minority Leader John Faso, a Bush
backer and Pataki political ally.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, McCain has very real problems in New York as he prepares for the
state's "Super Tuesday" March 7 primary, where 93 delegates will be at stake.
There are primaries or caucuses that same day in more than a dozen other states,
including California. That can stretch resources thin.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, only previously registered Republicans can vote in New York's GOP
presidential primary, unlike the open primaries of New Hampshire and Michigan
where McCain was boosted by votes from Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has only eight paid employees in New York and most of those aren't
political professionals.
</P>
<P>
	   "The other people here, while they may be involved in local politics, when
the campaign is over, one of them goes back to work at his engineering firm,
another guy goes back to work in a local government office, another guy goes
back to work doing this, that and the other thing," said Gerry O'Brien, McCain's
New York political director. "We don't have a tremendous number of people to
draw on from the professional side of things."
</P>
<P>
	   That's because Bush has almost the entire New York Republican Party
hierarchy, led by Pataki and Powers, working for him. The state party's
get-out-the-vote machinery is at the ready and most local Republican leaders are
in the Texas governor's corner.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd say he's well supported by the people who are well supported by
Republicans in this state," said Ellen DiFrancisco, the Bush campaign's
executive director in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, while McCain was able to leave New York's GOP with a black eye by
successfully beating back an attempt to keep him off the primary ballot, the
ballot itself shows off a Bush advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, primary voters vote for the delegates, not the candidates. The
Bush delegate slates are peopled with the famous names of New York's GOP
establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, one eastern New York congressional district, the Bush delegate
slate includes state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue
and U.S. Rep. John Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
	   "Republicans walk into a voting booth in a Republican primary, they will see
names they recognize and that they trust," Powers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Not so for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   "To vote for John McCain, they're going to have to vote for these names, in
a lot of cases, people have never heard of," said state Assemblyman Thomas
Kirwan of Newburgh, one of the few elected Republicans for McCain. "Unless they
know what the deal is, they're going to go in and vote and they're going to vote
for the names they're familiar with."
</P>
<P>
	   To counter that, the McCain camp has launched a voter education effort
utilizing news conferences, phone calls and mailings.
</P>
<P>
	   The stakes for Pataki are high.
</P>
<P>
	   "Governor Pataki has pledged an all out effort to win New York for Governor
Bush and everyone's going to be working on the campaign, from the delegates on
up," DiFrancisco said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Powers admitted some concern.
</P>
<P>
	   "You always have to be worried," he said. "But again, if you look at it, the
entire Republican organization is there, a lot of Republican officials are there
and a lot of them are (prospective) delegates. They'll all want to be out
working in their districts to make sure that they win."

<HEADLINE> Polls: Bush and McCain competitive in New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Two statewide polls show Sen. John McCain poised to
give Texas Gov. George W. Bush a tough test in New York's March 7 presidential
primary.
<P>
	   A CBS News/New York Times poll out today has Bush leading McCain, 43 percent
to 36 percent, with Alan Keyes at 4 percent among enrolled Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Another poll, out Wednesday from Marist College's Institute for Public
Opinion, found Bush supported by 43 percent of Republican voters in New York
with McCain backed by 41 percent, a statistical tie given the poll's margin of
error. Keyes trailed at 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those Republicans considered likely to vote in the state's primary, 46
percent said they backed Bush while 43 percent said they favored McCain, also a
statistical tie in the Marist poll. One percent said they backed Keyes while 9
percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   A Feb. 8 Marist poll found Bush leading McCain, 46 percent to 35 percent,
among registered Republicans and, 48 percent to 39 percent, among likely GOP
primary voters. A December poll from Marist had Bush leading McCain, 59 percent
to 15 percent among New York Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   The CBS News/New York Times poll found Al Gore leading Bill Bradley, 59
percent to 28 percent, among Democratic voters in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The polling news, plus McCain's primary wins Tuesday in Michigan and
Arizona, means "invincibility has been shattered, electability is now on the
table" on the Republican side, according to Marist pollster Lee Mirningoff.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's popularity among New York Republicans has been on the rise since
his strong primary victory over Bush in New Hampshire. That came in the wake of
his highly publicized and successful battle to get on the New York primary
ballot despite the efforts of Bush's New York backers, including Gov. George
Pataki and state GOP Chairman William Powers, to keep the senator from Arizona
off the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Marist College's latest telephone survey of 363 registered Republicans was
conducted Sunday through Tuesday of this week and has a margin of error of plus
or minus 5 percentage points. The margin of error for the sample of 201 likely
GOP voters is plus or minus 7 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   The CBS News/New York Times telephone poll was conducted Feb. 16-22. The
sample of 374 Republicans carries with it a margin of error of plus or minus 5
percentage points. The margin of error for the sample of 542 Democrats was plus
or minus 4 percentage points.

think about their money.

<P>
	   Many investment managers consider Americans to be the world's most
sophisticated personal investors. About 48 percent of American households own
mutual funds, contributing a collective total of $6.45 trillion to world
financial markets. At the heart of the trend is the phasing out of old-fashioned
pension plans which has forced millions of Americans take an interest in
investing through programs such as the 401(k).
</P>
<P>
	   But some investment managers fear the tremendous growth in the American
market for products such as mutual funds might be slowing.
</P>
<P>
	   So now they're looking overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   Some foreign countries still have the old-style retirement plans -- plans
that governments and employers are beginning to realize will be extremely
costly, and in some cases, don't provide enough benefits to support retirees.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan, for example, is moving toward a system similar to the 401(k), in
which workers and their employers both contribute to an investment account.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korea, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and Italy are also
popular targets for American money managers.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a growing understanding that retirement planning is going to be on
the individual level," Beams said. "(People) are leaving the traditional
investment world, the checking and savings accounts, and moving much more
rapidly into mutual funds."
</P>
<P>
	   Fidelity International Limited, the Bermuda-based international arm of
mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments, manages about $110 billion -- about 10
percent of its Boston-based parent's assets.
</P>
<P>
	   "But it could be potentially many times the size of the U.S. market," said
Paul Kafka, an executive director at Fidelity International.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the $127 billion managed by Boston-based Nvest Associates, only $7.2
billion comes from overseas, and most of that is from institutional investors.
Fleet Investment Management has less than $1 billion in overseas money in its
$38 billion mutual fund portfolio.
</P>
<P>
	   "I truly would like to move that over the next five years to about 40
percent of our business," said Fleet's senior managing director and chief
executive officer, Robert Ash.
</P>
<P>
	   Tax codes generally block foreign investors from taking advantage of most
American investment products.
</P>
<P>
	   To get around those hindrances, many firms register their products in
foreign countries and gear them exclusively to foreign residents. But such plans
are frequently tailored for wealthier investors, making average-income people in
other countries an under-served but potentially huge market.
</P>
<P>
	   While its often said in the investment management industry that the United
States is about 10 years ahead of the rest of the world in terms investing
sophistication, Scudder Kemper's Beams said new investment options around the
world will quickly help close that gap.
</P>
<P>
	   "The U.S. really led the way, in terms of mutual funds particularly, but the
second wave of innovation doesn't take as much time," she said. "The jump for
the international markets will be much faster."

<HEADLINE> Investors May Pick Trading Markets  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- You call your broker. You want to buy 50 shares of a hot
new tech stock, but you don't stop there: you also choose the market in which
you believe you can get the best price on your trade.
</P>
<P>
	   The scenario may not be far-fetched, a top securities regulator said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Change has been sweeping the markets, as millions of new investors and
increasing competition from new electronic communications networks have put
pressure on the nation's two biggest exchanges, the New York Stock Exchange and
the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   If the traditional exchanges and the networks, known as ECNs, were linked
nationwide, with a central electronic "order book" showing all stock quotes,
individual investors could choose a specific market for a trade, said Annette
Nazareth, director of market regulation at the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   "It may lead to that," Nazareth told reporters in a telephone conference
call. "Customers will start to require" their brokers to make trades in a
specific market.
</P>
<P>
	   She noted that some brokers already have started to offer such choices to
their customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Nazareth was discussing a "concept release" which the SEC put out for 60
days of public comment, presenting several possible options for changing how
stocks are traded and quoted. The option likely to arouse the most controversy
is that of a central, nationwide system displaying orders to buy and sell.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the U.S. markets fail to meet investor needs by offering the fairest and
most efficient trading mechanisms possible, an increasingly competitive
international environment will be sure to offer alternatives for investors," the
SEC said in a press release announcing its request for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC would have to approve any linking of the stock exchanges and the
ECNs, some of which have asked the regulators to put them on the same legal
footing as the traditional exchanges.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC said it has not determined at this time that it needs to take action
to respond to the sprouting of competing markets. The agency issued the concept
release because it wants "all views to be heard," Nazareth said.
</P>
<P>
	   SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt warned in a November speech that the nation's
stock markets will lose their competitive edge to overseas markets if investors
lose confidence in the ability to get their trades completed at the best prices,
commonly known as best execution.
</P>
<P>
	   "The stakes have never been greater for America's markets," Levitt told
securities industry executives. "We simply cannot afford to let our competitive
edge be dulled."
</P>
<P>
	   Specifically, he criticized the practice of payment for order flow, in which
brokerage firms are paid to route their trades through a particular market.
Levitt said the practice raises conflict-of-interest questions if the brokerage
firms are routing trades to make a profit rather than to get their customers the
best execution.
</P>
<P>
	   Roy Zuckerberg, chairman of the Securities Industry Association and advisory
director at brokerage firm Goldman Sachs Group, has rebuffed suggestions that
Wall Street has dragged its feet in responding to the competitive challenges
brought by new technology and ways of trading.
</P>
<P>
	   SIA spokesman Jim Spellman said Wednesday the group welcomed the SEC's
"effort to address these enormously complex market-structure issues."
</P>
<P>
	   Faced with the competition from ECNs, the New York Stock Exchange and the
electronic Nasdaq market are considering selling stock to the public to raise
money and give themselves greater operating flexibility, a move that would
transform them into for-profit businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Also reshaping the markets are extended trading hours and an anticipated
switch this year to decimalization -- quoting stocks in dollars and cents,
rather than the 200-year-old tradition of fractions.

<HEADLINE> Debit Case Gets Class-Action Status  </HEADLINE>
    By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Visa and MasterCard plan to appeal a judge's decision to
grant class-action status to a lawsuit by the nation's largest retailers and
smaller merchants accusing the companies of antitrust violations costing $8.1
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn gave the retailers and
merchants the pre-trial legal victory Wednesday, but otherwise made clear in his
45-page written decision that he was not ruling on the merits of the case. The
retailers are challenging fees charged by Visa and Mastercard for debit cards.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also encouraged the parties to appeal his ruling on class-action
status, saying the issue "raises substantial and novel questions involving the
standards a district court should apply in evaluating a class motion and the
interaction of those standards with antitrust principles."
</P>
<P>
	   Kelly Presta, a Visa spokesman, said the company will appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   He said class-action status means even those merchants who have
enthusiastically promoted the debit cards would become adversaries of the
company in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   "Including them is illogical," he said. "This is a far reaching class that
isn't really appropriate."
</P>
<P>
	   He predicted Visa would win the case at trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharon Gamsin, a spokeswoman for MasterCard, said the company also planned
an appeal, saying the "lawsuit is without merit."
</P>
<P>
	   She said rules requiring merchants to accept all Mastercard credit and debit
cards are meant to protect consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   The 3-year-old lawsuit accuses Visa USA Inc. and MasterCard International of
using a monopoly in credit cards since 1992 to force businesses to pay
exorbitant transaction fees to accept debit cards.
</P>
<P>
	   The $8.1 billion damage estimate is the amount businesses contend they were
overcharged by the credit-card companies. If the retailers win, the damage award
could triple under antitrust law to $24.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Gleeson acknowledged that the litigation "poses enormous financial risks for
the defendants, risks that are obviously increased drastically by certification
of the class."
</P>
<P>
	   A trial is set to begin Nov. 27. The class of plaintiffs will now consist of
about 4 million merchants, including Wal-Mart Stores, Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.,
Safeway Stores Inc., Circuit City Stores Inc. and the National Retail
Federation.
</P>
<P>
	   Businesses typically pay fees ranging from 1 percent to 2 percent of the
amount spent by a customer each time a credit or debit card is used. The cards
provide numerous advantages for businesses by making it easier for consumers to
make purchases and decreasing the amount of cash susceptible to theft. It also
guarantees payment to a merchant, whereas a check can bounce.
</P>
<P>
	   Generally, the amount of each credit or debit card transaction is deposited
into the bank account of the business within a day or so.
</P>
<P>
	   But the lawsuit contends that the transaction fee for debit cards should be
much lower because the cards pose a much lower risk for credit card companies
since money is taken directly out of a customer's bank account.
</P>
<P>
	   The merchants say that debit card competitors of Visa and Mastercard charge
as little as a nickel for the same transaction for which Visa and Mastercard
charge more than a dollar.

<HEADLINE> Knievel Son Makes Texas Train Jump  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALESTINE, Texas (AP) -- The son of famed stuntman Evel Knievel jumped a
moving locomotive Wednesday in a 200-foot, ramp-to-ramp motorcycle stunt on live
television.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 15,000 people gathered along the eastern Texas tracks to watch
as Robbie Knievel took off on a motorcycle just before a Texas State Railroad
locomotive plowed into his wooden ramp.
</P>
<P>
	   Knievel landed safely on the other side, then ran to the top of the ramp to
wave to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That was close,'' he said, smiling and out of breath.
</P>
<P>
	   In a state that leads the nation in vehicle-train collisions, the stuntman
offered several disclaimers before the jump.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anybody out there that tries this is out of their mind,'' the 37-year-old
told the Palestine Herald-Press in Wednesday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Railroad Commission Chairman Michael Williams asked Fox TV to show
public-service announcements about train safety during the program because of
fears the jump might trivialize the dangers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Robbie is a professional stuntman and this is not to suggest that anyone
should try anything like this at home,'' a Fox TV spokeswoman in Los Angeles,
who declined to be identified, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Knievel achieved notoriety in April 1989 by jumping the fountains at Caesars
Palace in Las Vegas, a stunt that nearly killed his father 21 years earlier. In
May, he jumped a 200-foot-wide chasm of the Grand Canyon.

<HEADLINE> Thruway Authority kills plan to raise prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A possible toll hike for the New York Thruway has
been abandoned by state officials after heavy criticism from Gov. George Pataki
and state leaders.
<P>
	   The Thruway Authority's three-member board on Wednesday unanimously adopted
a resolution killing its Jan. 27 plan for toll hikes based on increases in a
20-city Construction Cost Index.
</P>
<P>
	   The first-year increase would have been 1.8 percent beginning June 1. The
Thruway's per-mile charge for passenger cars would have gone from 3.1 cents to
3.2 cents with the anticipated toll increase.
</P>
<P>
	   "Continuing to reduce taxes on New Yorkers is the right thing to do to
ensure our future prosperity, raising Thruway tolls is not," said state Senate
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican who had led the
fight against the toll hikes. "Fortunately, this plan has now been rejected."
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno, Pataki, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and state Comptroller H. Carl
McCoy had all come out against the toll hikes after the previously unannounced
plan became public. The authority board is appointed by the governor but he said
at the time that he had not been told about the toll-hike plans.
</P>
<P>
	   "A couple of weeks ago, I made it plain that we had not seen a toll hike in
my five and a half years as governor and I do not want to see a toll hike as we
go forward," Pataki said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   As with the Thruway Authority's original plan to raise tolls, word of its
abandoning the plan first came from Bruno. The authority later issued a
statement confirming that.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was an ill-conceived plan," Silver said. "I'm glad that the authority
has seen the light that we pointed out to them a couple of weeks ago."
</P>
<P>
	   Thruway officials had said they needed the extra money to pay for roadway
improvements over the next five years, from lane additions in some urban
stretches to things like a "flyover" at the Thruway's busiest exit, No. 24 in
Albany. The flyover would be a special link between the Thruway and Interstate
87 only for E-Z Pass users.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately known how the Thruway Authority would now pay for
these projects, but Thruway Executive Director John Platt said "we look forward
to working with the governor and Legislature on solutions to these pressing
needs."
</P>
<P>
	   Tolls last increased on the Thruway, the nation's longest toll road, in 1988
by 31 percent. However, since 1994, Thruway Authority operating expenses have
increased by just 1 percent while the number of Thruway employees have been
reduced by 500, Platt said.

<HEADLINE> An underground fire disrupts phone services in upstate New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A fire in an old subway tunnel melted a section
of fiber-optic cable, disrupting long-distance, Internet and cellular telephone
services for thousands of Frontier Corp. customers in upstate New York.
<P>
	   The fire, apparently started by vagrants early Wednesday, cut off
long-distance service for 12 hours for most Frontier customers in and around
Rochester. Local telephone and 911 calls, which rely on copper wiring, were
unaffected.
</P>
<P>
	   Rochester's 9-mile-long subway, which ran underground for just 1 1/2 miles,
opened in 1927. Ridership peaked at 5 million in 1947, but the growing
popularity of automobiles and the demise of five connecting railroads led to the
last passenger run in 1956.
</P>
<P>
	   Vagrants trying to keep warm were suspected of starting a wood fire that
burned out of control in the disused subway line near the Genesee River, said
Frontier spokesman Tor Constantino. The intense heat managed to burn through the
fire-retardant tubing that encases the fiber-optic line, and about 150 feet of
it had to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   "A majority of residential and business customers" of Frontier's
long-distance service lost the ability to make outgoing calls, Constantino said,
adding that he was unable to estimate how many thousands of customers were
affected.
</P>
<P>
	   An unspecified number of Internet users also lost their connection - and
Frontier's reach as an Internet provider extends the breadth of upstate New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the outage disrupted cell phone service as far away as
Binghamton by knocking out incoming and outgoing calls for people served by Bell
Atlantic Mobile.
</P>
<P>
	   Frontier, a century-old telephone carrier with a nationwide long-distance
network, was bought out last year by Global Crossing Ltd., a Bermuda-based
telecommunications upstart. Founded in 1899, it changed its name from Rochester
Telephone in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Frontier sprouted beyond its roots as a local phone monopoly in Rochester -
a metro region of nearly 1 million people - by buying more than a half-dozen
long-distance carriers in the 1990s and becoming one of the nation's top 10
long-distance providers.

<HEADLINE> McCain surges in New York, but still has uphill battle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A new poll says John McCain is in a dead heat among
Republicans with George W. Bush for New York's GOP-only primary, bringing up
questions of whether the state Republican party can actually deliver the state
for their favored candidate.
<P>
	   "New York is definitely in play for the Republicans," said pollster Lee
Miringoff, head of Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion.
</P>
<P>
	   The Marist poll had Bush favored by 43 percent of Republican voters to 41
percent for McCain. In December, the Texas governor led McCain, 59 percent to 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bush retains the support of most of New York's top Republican leaders,
including New York Gov. George Pataki and state GOP Chairman William Powers,
there are those who say GOP leaders are getting nervous.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not the only one with food-poisoning symptoms in New York state this
morning," said an under-the-weather Jay Severin, a New York-based GOP
consultant. "There's a train coming to New York and the Republican establishment
has only two choices, you can get on it or you get struck by it."
</P>
<P>
	   Even before Tuesday's Michigan and Arizona primaries, there had been signs
of trouble for Bush in New York. On Saturday, U.S. Rep. Peter King of Long
Island switched his allegiance from Bush to McCain. State Assemblymen Joel
Miller of Poughkeepsie and Philip Boyle of Long Island have also joined the
McCain camp in recent days.
</P>
<P>
	   Publicly, state GOP leaders professed little concern Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not nervous," said state Assembly Minority Leader John Faso, a Bush
backer and Pataki political ally.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, McCain has very real problems in New York as he prepares for the
state's "Super Tuesday" March 7 primary, where 93 delegates will be at stake.
There are primaries or caucuses that same day in more than a dozen other states,
including California. That can stretch resources thin.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, only previously registered Republicans can vote in New York's GOP
presidential primary, unlike the open primaries of New Hampshire and Michigan
where McCain was boosted by votes from Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has only eight paid employees in New York and most of those aren't
political professionals.
</P>
<P>
	   "The other people here, while they may be involved in local politics, when
the campaign is over, one of them goes back to work at his engineering firm,
another guy goes back to work in a local government office, another guy goes
back to work doing this, that and the other thing," said Gerry O'Brien, McCain's
New York political director. "We don't have a tremendous number of people to
draw on from the professional side of things."
</P>
<P>
	   That's because Bush has almost the entire New York Republican Party
hierarchy, led by Pataki and Powers, working for him. The state party's
get-out-the-vote machinery is at the ready and most local Republican leaders are
in the Texas governor's corner.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd say he's well supported by the people who are well supported by
Republicans in this state," said Ellen DiFrancisco, the Bush campaign's
executive director in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, while McCain was able to leave New York's GOP with a black eye by
successfully beating back an attempt to keep him off the primary ballot, the
ballot itself shows off a Bush advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, primary voters vote for the delegates, not the candidates. The
Bush delegate slates are peopled with the famous names of New York's GOP
establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, one eastern New York congressional district, the Bush delegate
slate includes state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue
and U.S. Rep. John Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
	   "Republicans walk into a voting booth in a Republican primary, they will see
names they recognize and that they trust," Powers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Not so for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   "To vote for John McCain, they're going to have to vote for these names, in
a lot of cases, people have never heard of," said state Assemblyman Thomas
Kirwan of Newburgh, one of the few elected Republicans for McCain. "Unless they
know what the deal is, they're going to go in and vote and they're going to vote
for the names they're familiar with."
</P>
<P>
	   To counter that, the McCain camp has launched a voter education effort
utilizing news conferences, phone calls and mailings.
</P>
<P>
	   The stakes for Pataki are high.
</P>
<P>
	   "Governor Pataki has pledged an all out effort to win New York for Governor
Bush and everyone's going to be working on the campaign, from the delegates on
up," DiFrancisco said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Powers admitted some concern.
</P>
<P>
	   "You always have to be worried," he said. "But again, if you look at it, the
entire Republican organization is there, a lot of Republican officials are there
and a lot of them are (prospective) delegates. They'll all want to be out
working in their districts to make sure that they win."

<HEADLINE> Polls: Bush and McCain competitive in New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Two statewide polls show Sen. John McCain poised to
give Texas Gov. George W. Bush a tough test in New York's March 7 presidential
primary.
<P>
	   A CBS News/New York Times poll out today has Bush leading McCain, 43 percent
to 36 percent, with Alan Keyes at 4 percent among enrolled Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Another poll, out Wednesday from Marist College's Institute for Public
Opinion, found Bush supported by 43 percent of Republican voters in New York
with McCain backed by 41 percent, a statistical tie given the poll's margin of
error. Keyes trailed at 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those Republicans considered likely to vote in the state's primary, 46
percent said they backed Bush while 43 percent said they favored McCain, also a
statistical tie in the Marist poll. One percent said they backed Keyes while 9
percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   A Feb. 8 Marist poll found Bush leading McCain, 46 percent to 35 percent,
among registered Republicans and, 48 percent to 39 percent, among likely GOP
primary voters. A December poll from Marist had Bush leading McCain, 59 percent
to 15 percent among New York Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   The CBS News/New York Times poll found Al Gore leading Bill Bradley, 59
percent to 28 percent, among Democratic voters in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The polling news, plus McCain's primary wins Tuesday in Michigan and
Arizona, means "invincibility has been shattered, electability is now on the
table" on the Republican side, according to Marist pollster Lee Mirningoff.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's popularity among New York Republicans has been on the rise since
his strong primary victory over Bush in New Hampshire. That came in the wake of
his highly publicized and successful battle to get on the New York primary
ballot despite the efforts of Bush's New York backers, including Gov. George
Pataki and state GOP Chairman William Powers, to keep the senator from Arizona
off the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Marist College's latest telephone survey of 363 registered Republicans was
conducted Sunday through Tuesday of this week and has a margin of error of plus
or minus 5 percentage points. The margin of error for the sample of 201 likely
GOP voters is plus or minus 7 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   The CBS News/New York Times telephone poll was conducted Feb. 16-22. The
sample of 374 Republicans carries with it a margin of error of plus or minus 5
percentage points. The margin of error for the sample of 542 Democrats was plus
or minus 4 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> An underground fire disrupts phone services in upstate New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A fire in an old subway tunnel melted a section
of fiber-optic cable, disrupting long-distance, Internet and cellular telephone
services for thousands of Frontier Corp. customers in upstate New York.
<P>
	   The fire, apparently started by vagrants early Wednesday, cut off
long-distance service for 12 hours for most Frontier customers in and around
Rochester. Local telephone and 911 calls, which rely on copper wiring, were
unaffected.
</P>
<P>
	   Rochester's 9-mile-long subway, which ran underground for just 1 1/2 miles,
opened in 1927. Ridership peaked at 5 million in 1947, but the growing
popularity of automobiles and the demise of five connecting railroads led to the
last passenger run in 1956.
</P>
<P>
	   Vagrants trying to keep warm were suspected of starting a wood fire that
burned out of control in the disused subway line near the Genesee River, said
Frontier spokesman Tor Constantino. The intense heat managed to burn through the
fire-retardant tubing that encases the fiber-optic line, and about 150 feet of
it had to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   "A majority of residential and business customers" of Frontier's
long-distance service lost the ability to make outgoing calls, Constantino said,
adding that he was unable to estimate how many thousands of customers were
affected.
</P>
<P>
	   An unspecified number of Internet users also lost their connection - and
Frontier's reach as an Internet provider extends the breadth of upstate New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the outage disrupted cell phone service as far away as
Binghamton by knocking out incoming and outgoing calls for people served by Bell
Atlantic Mobile.
</P>
<P>
	   Frontier, a century-old telephone carrier with a nationwide long-distance
network, was bought out last year by Global Crossing Ltd., a Bermuda-based
telecommunications upstart. Founded in 1899, it changed its name from Rochester
Telephone in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Frontier sprouted beyond its roots as a local phone monopoly in Rochester -
a metro region of nearly 1 million people - by buying more than a half-dozen
long-distance carriers in the 1990s and becoming one of the nation's top 10
long-distance providers.

<HEADLINE> Thruway Authority kills plan to raise prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A possible toll hike for the New York Thruway has
been abandoned by state officials after heavy criticism from Gov. George Pataki
and state leaders.
<P>
	   The Thruway Authority's three-member board on Wednesday unanimously adopted
a resolution killing its Jan. 27 plan for toll hikes based on increases in a
20-city Construction Cost Index.
</P>
<P>
	   The first-year increase would have been 1.8 percent beginning June 1. The
Thruway's per-mile charge for passenger cars would have gone from 3.1 cents to
3.2 cents with the anticipated toll increase.
</P>
<P>
	   "Continuing to reduce taxes on New Yorkers is the right thing to do to
ensure our future prosperity, raising Thruway tolls is not," said state Senate
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican who had led the
fight against the toll hikes. "Fortunately, this plan has now been rejected."
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno, Pataki, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and state Comptroller H. Carl
McCoy had all come out against the toll hikes after the previously unannounced
plan became public. The authority board is appointed by the governor but he said
at the time that he had not been told about the toll-hike plans.
</P>
<P>
	   "A couple of weeks ago, I made it plain that we had not seen a toll hike in
my five and a half years as governor and I do not want to see a toll hike as we
go forward," Pataki said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   As with the Thruway Authority's original plan to raise tolls, word of its
abandoning the plan first came from Bruno. The authority later issued a
statement confirming that.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was an ill-conceived plan," Silver said. "I'm glad that the authority
has seen the light that we pointed out to them a couple of weeks ago."
</P>
<P>
	   Thruway officials had said they needed the extra money to pay for roadway
improvements over the next five years, from lane additions in some urban
stretches to things like a "flyover" at the Thruway's busiest exit, No. 24 in
Albany. The flyover would be a special link between the Thruway and Interstate
87 only for E-Z Pass users.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately known how the Thruway Authority would now pay for
these projects, but Thruway Executive Director John Platt said "we look forward
to working with the governor and Legislature on solutions to these pressing
needs."
</P>
<P>
	   Tolls last increased on the Thruway, the nation's longest toll road, in 1988
by 31 percent. However, since 1994, Thruway Authority operating expenses have
increased by just 1 percent while the number of Thruway employees have been
reduced by 500, Platt said.

<P>
    EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Bill Guerin scored twice as the Edmonton Oilers
rallied from a two-goal deficit to beat the Boston Bruins 4-2 on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Boston was playing just hours after Bruins defenseman Marty McSorley
received a season-ending suspension for a stick attack on Vancouver's Donald
Brashear on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Ethan Moreau and Sean Brown also scored for the Oilers, who trailed 2-0
midway through the first period. Todd Marchant added two assists, and Bill
Ranford made 29 saves.
</P>
<P>
	   Don Sweeney and Mikko Eloranta scored for the Bruins, and John Grahame
stopped 31 shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Sweeney opened the scoring at 5:44 of the first period, and Eloranta made it
2-0 at 11:06. Guerin scored on a power play with 2:52 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   Moreau tied it with 5:20 left in the second period, and Brown gave the
Oilers a 3-2 lead at 8:07 of the third. Guerin completed the scoring 27 seconds

<HEADLINE> Predators 4, Blackhawks 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Steve Passmore had much better luck summing up the Chicago
Blackhawks' latest loss than he did stopping the puck in the third period.
</P>
<P>
	   "They came out flying in the third and we came out flat," Passmore said
after Chicago's 4-2 loss to Nashville on Wednesday night. "We're finding new
ways to shoot ourselves in the foot. We're starting to be creative about it."
</P>
<P>
	   Dave Legwand and Drake Berehowsky scored goals 52 seconds apart early in the
third period for the Predators.
</P>
<P>
	   "We played a defensive game, then came out in the third and it was good for
us" said Berehowsky, who assisted on Legwand's goal. "Then when they scored, we
didn't fold our tents and give in."
</P>
<P>
	   Sebastien Bordeleau and Tom Fitzgerald also had third-period goals for the
Predators, who won their second straight after losing six in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   Alex Zhamnov and Doug Gilmour scored for Chicago, which has lost two
straight and is 1-5 in its last six. Chicago star Tony Amonte's goal streak was
snapped at six games.
</P>
<P>
	   "Both teams played well defensively," Nashville coach Barry Trotz said. "No
one wanted to make a mistake."
</P>
<P>
	   Legwand opened the scoring with a power-play goal 28 seconds into the third.
After Nashville's Patric Kjellberg lost the puck in the slot, Legwand slid it
under Passmore from 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
	   Berehowsky made it 2-0 at 1:20, taking Scott Walker's pass from behind the
net and one-timing a close-range shot past Passmore.
</P>
<P>
	   Zhamnov cut it to 2-1 with 9:15 left in the period with a power-play goal.
He beat goalie Mike Dunham on a screened shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Bordeleau made it 3-1 with 7:31 left, beating Passmore with a wrist shot
from the left circle. Gilmour countered 26 seconds later, scoring off a rebound.
</P>
<P>
	   Fitzgerald completed the scoring with an empty-net goal with 14.5 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   "Boom, we get a couple of goals, then it kind of opens up a bit in the third
period," Fitzgerald said.

<HEADLINE> Scientologist Death Said Accidental  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Four years after a Scientologist died while
being treated by church members following a traffic accident, a medical examiner
ruled the woman's death was accidental.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision by Pasco-Pinellas Medical Examiner Joan Wood to change the
cause of Lisa McPherson's death from ``undetermined'' could have a major impact
on the state's prosecution of the Clearwater-based church.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors have charged the church with practicing medicine without a
license and abusing a disabled adult for its treatment of McPherson. Now,
prosecutors have to decide whether to drop, amend or pursue the charges.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to review (Wood's decision),'' said Assistant State Doug Crow said
Wednesday. ``I wouldn't want to speculate about what effect it may have.''
</P>
<P>
	   Church attorney Sandy Weinberg predicted that if prosecutors do not dismiss
the charges, a judge will.
</P>
<P>
	   Wood, who was unavailable for comment, filed the amended autopsy Friday
after reviewing new medical evidence and test results, most of them provided by
church-hired experts, said her attorney, Jeff Goodis.
</P>
<P>
	   Wood originally said McPherson died of a blood clot in her lungs caused by
bed rest and severe dehydration, but the new report drops the references to bed
rest and dehydration and lists psychosis and the auto accident as contributing
factors.
</P>
<P>
	   McPherson, 36, died in December 1995, 17 days after being involved in a
minor traffic accident. She took off her clothes and began walking down the
street. Police took her to a hospital, but she left with Scientology officials,
who wanted her to avoid psychiatric treatment, which is against church
teachings.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say she was given unprescribed medicine and forcibly restrained
by church officials. McPherson eventually was taken to a hospital, but was
pronounced dead.
</P>
<P>
	   Church officials have denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
	   The Church of Scientology, based in Los Angeles, was founded in 1954 by the
late science-fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard. His book ``Dianetics'' formed the
basis of his philosophy that traumatic memories in past lives could be cleared
through church counseling.

   BREMERTON, Wash. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate John McCain ran
into a slight delay getting his campaign out of Washington state Wednesday night
when a wheel on his plane got stuck in some mud at the airport in Bremerton.

<HEADLINE> Tonya Harding Arrested for Assault  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMAS, Wash. (AP) -- Former Olympic ice skater Tonya Harding was arrested
after being accused of throwing a hubcap at her live-in boyfriend and repeatedly
punching him in the face.
</P>
<P>
	Harding, 29, was ordered to appear Thursday in Camas Municipal Court.
</P>
<P>
	She was booked Tuesday night for investigation of fourth-degree domestic
violence assault after an altercation that left Darren Silver's face bruised and
bloodied, Camas police said. She was released an hour later.
</P>
<P>
	Police said Harding and Silver, 28, have lived together for about three years.
</P>
<P>
	According to police, Harding and Silver, both of whom appeared intoxicated,
began fighting Tuesday night in a barn they use as a garage behind their house.
Two men inside the barn told officers Harding threw a hubcap at Silver, hitting
him in the face, then began pummeling him with punches.
</P>
<P>
	Police said Harding told officers Silver had held her on the ground and she hit
him to protect herself, a statement police said witness accounts did not back
up.
</P>
<P>
	In a recording of the 911 call released Wednesday by police, a male voice says:
``I want to find out the rules, if we'd both go to jail or not, because my
girlfriend is beating the ... out of me.''
</P>
<P>
	Later, a female voice says: ``I punched him in the face because he came after
me, he put me to the ground.'' In the background, a male voice can be heard
yelling: ``I did not! You are a liar! You are a liar! You are a felon and I have
nothing to hide!''
</P>
<P>
	Harding, who teaches figure skating at a Portland, Ore., mall, was arrested and
ordered to stay away from Silver.
</P>
<P>
	Harding gained national attention in 1994 when she pleaded guilty to covering
up for her former husband and his friends, who hatched a plot to injure
Harding's chief rival, skater Nancy Kerrigan, as Kerrigan practiced for the
national figure skating championship. Harding won the championship and later
competed at the 1994 Lillehammer Olympic games.
</P>
<P>
	Harding was banned from amateur skating for life later that year because of her
role in the attack.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Carlos Santana, who first gained fame a generation ago
with a searing guitar performance at Woodstock, capped a triumphant comeback
Wednesday with a record-tying eight Grammy Awards. The 52-year-old guitarist's
multi-platinum "Supernatural" won album of the year. His first No. 1 single,
"Smooth," capped a sweep of the major Grammys by winning song and record of the
year. Santana tied Michael Jackson's 1983 record of most Grammys on a single
night. "Music is the vehicle for the magic of healing," he said upon accepting
the album of the year trophy, "and the music of 'Supernatural' was a sign and
designed to bring unity and harmony."

<HEADLINE> Patients May Have Been Exposed  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Georgetown University Medical Center is trying to contact
nearly 300 former patients to warn them they might have been exposed to HIV and
other infectious diseases by a medical technician accused of siphoning
painkillers with potentially contaminated needles.
</P>
<P>
	   The patients are being advised to seek testing for HIV and other diseases as
a precaution, said hospital spokesman Paul Donovan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even though the risk is extremely low we want to take the appropriate
precautions for our patients,'' Donovan said. ``We cannot confirm that anyone
was or was not exposed to infection.''
</P>
<P>
	   The technician, Jeffrey Royal, was caught Feb. 2 siphoning the powerful
synthetic painkiller fentanyl from a patient's intravenous line with a syringe.
He was immediately fired and arrested, Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Royal, 40, was arraigned Tuesday in federal court on a charge of tampering
with consumer products, a felony that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in
prison and a $250,000 fine, The Washington Post reported in its Thursday
editions.
</P>
<P>
	   The medical center has been working with District of Columbia health
officials and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta to
notify the patients who may have been exposed.
</P>
<P>
	   The medical center started informing the physicians of the potentially
exposed patients last week and began sending letters to the 294 patients on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Georgetown is offering patients free testing for a full range of infectious
diseases as well free counseling. Patients can call a 24-hour hotline at
1-202-784-0015.

<HEADLINE> Superior Court Judge on hot seat for reappointment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A Legislative committee is expected to decide
Friday whether to recommend the reappointment a Superior Court judge who has
come under harsh criticism for his handling of a 1995 murder trial.
<P>
	   Judge David Fineberg presided over the trial of John Tyler Fuessenich, when
he was found innocent of murder despite admitting to killing James Irwin Jr. and
dumping his body off a back road in Morris. Fuessenich, who said the killing was
in self-defense, was tried twice on the murder charge. The first trial ended in
1992 with a deadlocked jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Fineberg's critics say the judge displayed a dislike for the prosecutor, Guy
Wolfe III, and the victim's family. They said his demeanor tainted the jury, and
they blasted the judge for setting up a rope in the courtroom that separated the
family from Wolf.
</P>
<P>
	   Irwin's mother, Rosaria Irwin, told members of the Judiciary Committee on
Wednesday that she was ordered by Fineberg not to cry during the trial. Her
daughter, Kathleen O'Toole, said Fineberg did not allow her to sit in the
courtroom during testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   Irwin and O'Toole said Fineberg threatened to dismiss the case if family
members spoke to the media during the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   "Throughout the trial, Judge Fineberg displayed overt hostility toward
myself, my family and the prosecutor," Irwin said. "I feel that the people of
the state of Connecticut need to be protected from individuals such as Judge
Fineberg. In my eyes, the way in which he conducts his trials, exhibiting total
disregard for the law, makes him no different than the people he tried."
</P>
<P>
	   If the Judiciary Committee decides to recommend Fineberg for reappointment
to a second 2-year term the appointment would then go on to a vote before the
entire General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   Fineberg presided over the Fuessenich case as a Litchfield Superior Court
judge. He currently sits in Hartford Superior Court and hears civil cases.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, he was admonished by the state Judicial Review Council for
threatening Wolfe with contempt of court in front of a jury.
</P>
<P>
	   The Council concluded Fineberg's comment was "an unfavorable judicial
practice."
</P>
<P>
	   Such an admonishment is the least serious action the Council can take
against a judge. State law permits admonishment when there is no legal basis for
removal, suspension, or censure.
</P>
<P>
	   "I made a mistake which I regret, and I assure all of you it will not happen
again," Fineberg said about his threats to Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
	   Fineberg said he wanted the victim's mother and sister out of the courtroom
because they were potential witnesses. He said they may have heard testimony
that would have influenced their own. They were never called to testify, and
Irwin's mother was allowed to observe the entire trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Fineberg explained he had the rope strung up to keep a sense of calm in his
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought I was doing right, but it probably left the wrong message with
the family," Fineberg said. "I regret doing it, and I apologize for doing it."
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Glenn Coe, who investigated Fineberg's handling of the Fuessenich
trial for the state Judge's Association, said the judge never threatened to
dismiss the case if family members spoke to the press.
</P>
<P>
	   "What I did read in the transcripts was vigorous advocacy by experienced
counsel, a judge open to considering and reconsidering the arguments of counsel,
a judge who carefully read cases ... and a judge who treated the attorneys with
courtesy and respect," Coe said.
</P>
<P>
	   If Fineberg is not reappointed, the 68-year-old judge will lose his $106,558
annual salary and the $70,000-a-year state pension he would start receiving in
two years. Judges are required by law to retire at age 70.

<HEADLINE> AG report critical of Anderson handling of state loans, lover  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A Hartford business and civic leader was "dumb
and derelict" in handling state loans for a woman who claimed she was his sex
slave, according to a state investigation.
<P>
	   Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said Wednesday that Arthur Anderson
should reimburse the $200,000 in insurance claims that he funneled to his
mistress, Doris Ford, instead of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   In the late 1980s, Ford borrowed more than $600,000 to buy and renovate four
apartment buildings. The money was loaned through the Capitol Housing Finance
Corp., a creation of the Hartford business community to finance rehabilitation
of low-income housing in the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson's company, Imagineers, was hired by CHFC to administer the loan
program. Anderson resigned last August from his position as the program's
state-appointed chief.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1993 and 1994, two of Ford's four buildings were destroyed by fire,
resulting in more than $200,000 in insurance payoffs. Blumenthal said Anderson
let Ford keep that cash instead of making sure it went to the state and the
CHFC.
</P>
<P>
	   Blumenthal said Ford was continually in default on her CHFC loans.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson also gave Ford more than $500,000 of his own money between 1994 and
1998 to keep her quiet about their sexual relationship, Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
	   "By his own admission, he was dumb and derelict in his duties," Blumenthal
said. "He failed to protect the state's interests. He was legally responsible
and should be held accountable."
</P>
<P>
	   Blumenthal said Anderson should repay the insurance money and also pay for
the cost of the state's investigation, which began in December 1998 after The
Hartford Courant exposed Anderson's relationship with Ford.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford has sued Anderson in federal court, asking that he be ordered to make
lifetime payments to her because he forced her to be his sex slave and promised
to support her.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anderson allowed a clandestine relationship to interfere with his moral and
legal responsibility to protect state funds," Blumenthal said. "The favoritism
and irregularities were serious and significant, and caused substantial
financial losses to the state."
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson maintains his relationship with Ford did not influence his
decisions. His lawyer, John Droney, said he and Anderson are negotiating a
settlement with the state but have not agreed on a dollar amount.
</P>
<P>
	   "Aside from my unfortunate personal involvement with Doris Ford, I did not
act unethically," Anderson said. "I will accept responsibility for decisions
fairly attributed to me. If I made a mistake that caused financial loss, it was
not because I improperly assisted Doris Ford or anyone else."
</P>
<P>
	   Blumenthal sent a copy of his findings to Chief State's Attorney John
Bailey, but did not recommend that any specific criminal charges be filed
against Anderson.
</P>
<P>
	   Bailey said he will review the report.

<HEADLINE> Murder trial of New Milford police officer begins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) - Just before Franklyn Reid was shot to death,
the police who were chasing him announced he was in custody, according to
evidence presented at the murder trial of New Milford Police Officer Scott
Smith.
<P>
	   Then came the call for an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith's trial got underway Wednesday in Superior Court and among the first
evidence to be presented were tapes of the police calls made just before and
after Smith shot Reid, and the testimony of Smith's colleagues at the New
Milford Police Department.
</P>
<P>
	   On the recordings played Wednesday, Smith's fellow police officers can be
heard trying to track down Reid, 27, and scrambling to mobilize after he was
shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Reid was said to be in custody, but less than a minute later, Detective
David Shortt calls for the ambulance.
</P>
<P>
	   Sgt. Robert Cramer testified that he speculated in a call to the police
station that Smith's gun "AD'd," or accidentally discharged, during Reid's
arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   "Well, you know what we've got. We've got a gunshot wound, apparently Smith
AD'd on a take-down," Cramer said on the tape.
</P>
<P>
	   Waterbury State's Attorney John Connelly, who was brought in as a special
prosecutor, chastised Cramer for speculating and not asking Smith what happened.
</P>
<P>
	   "A man is shot by a police officer, and you're guessing what happened?"
Connelly said. "You don't say, 'Hey, Smitty, what happened?"'
</P>
<P>
	   Cramer responded: "He was upset, and I just wanted to make sure he was OK."
</P>
<P>
	   Smith has claimed that he thought Reid was reaching for a weapon when he
shot him at point-blank range on Dec. 29, 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   A jury of seven men and five women was chosen to hear the case. There is one
black man on the jury. Reid was black and Smith is white.
</P>
<P>
	   The families of Reid and Smith both were in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are here to get a fair trial," said Reid's mother, Pearlylyn Reid.
</P>
<P>
	   The police communication tapes reveal that Reid was well-known to police
-officers recognized his name and appearance.
</P>
<P>
	   Reid was wanted in New Milford on several warrants, including threatening
and breach of peace, which are misdemeanors, and failure to appear in court. At
the time he was shot, he was out on $1,350 cash bond.
</P>
<P>
	   Cramer encountered Reid just after 11 a.m. The officer was driving a cruiser
along a road when Reid came from the other direction, crossing twice into the
oncoming lane and missing the cruiser by about a foot, Cramer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cramer turned around to follow Reid, but when he caught up to Reid's car, he
found it abandoned with the engine running. Cramer stayed with the car while
other officers in the area went to look for Reid.
</P>
<P>
	   Connelly pointed out that Cramer, who was in charge of the patrol officers
that day, did not call in any additional help until after Reid was shot.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you knew it was Franklyn Reid, did you say, 'Hey, this is Reid out
there. Get more men out there?"' Connelly said.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith and Shortt found Reid shortly after he fled the car, walking along
Route 202. They pulled into a nearby gas station and Reid fled. Smith ran after
him, and Shortt followed in an unmarked police car.
</P>
<P>
	   Cramer testified that Shortt told him he was calling police headquarters and
was trying to control the car in slippery conditions when he heard a shot.
Shortt told Cramer he did not see the shooting, but he looked up to see Reid
lying on the ground.

<HEADLINE> Blues 4, Sharks 1  </HEADLINE>
    By DENNIS GEORGATOS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Winning away from home is becoming a St. Louis
Blues' trademark.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephane Richer and Chris Pronger each scored goals in the second period as
the Blues broke a tie to beat the San Jose Sharks 4-1 Wednesday night for their
team-record ninth straight victory on the road.
</P>
<P>
	   The streak is one shy of the Buffalo Sabres' NHL record set in 1983-84 and
three better than the Blues' previous club record, achieved just a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott Young added an empty-net score after the Sharks pulled their
goaltender in the final minute. Michal Handzus also had a first-period goal for
St. Louis, which improved its overall road record to 21-8-2, best in the league.
Pavol Demitra assisted on two of the goals.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sharks, clinging to the last playoff spot in the Western Conference, had
hoped for a better start to a franchise record-tying nine-game homestand. They
have now lost nine of their last 12 in San Jose and failed to beat the Blues in
five meetings this season, going 0-4-1.
</P>
<P>
	   San Jose also lost defenseman Gary Suter, who left after straining a knee
midway through the second period. Linesman Wayne Bonney also left the game late
in the second period after being struck by a slap shot in the rib cage area.
</P>
<P>
	   Goaltender Roman Turek, who has been in the net for the nine straight road
victories, had 23 saves for his career-high 32nd win of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   San Jose's lone score came on Jeff Friesen's power-play goal at 15:10 of the
second period, tying it at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
	   Turek fended off the Sharks with two key saves in the third, stopping a slap
shot with his glove and dropping to his knees and using his pads to block
another from up close. It was the eighth straight game in which the Blues
haven't allowed a third-period goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Richer scored the go-ahead goal for St. Louis at 6:21 of the second, beating
goaltender Steve Shields on a wraparound after getting a pass from Marty
Reasoner.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blues added their third goal at the end of a 2-on-1 break.
</P>
<P>
	   The streaking Demitra drew the defender to him before passing off to
Pronger, who sent a slap shot up and over Shields' shoulder and into the net.

<HEADLINE> Defense rests in Louima conspiracy case after biting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Defense attorneys have rested their case after principal
defendant Charles Schwarz weathered a biting cross-examination on allegations he
took part in the sexual assault on Abner Louima and conspired with others to
cover it up.
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad pounded the 34-year-old former cop
with questions about the arrest of Louima in a 1997 street riot and what
happened later at Brooklyn's 70th Precinct, where another officer sodomized the
Haitian immigrant with a broken broom handle.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz - accused with two other officers of conspiring to obstruct justice
by concealing his role in the lavatory assault of Louima by fellow officer
Justin Volpe - insisted under Vinegrad's sarcastic, hostile grilling that he was
"never in that bathroom."
</P>
<P>
	   He also denied that scores of phone calls involving him and fellow
defendants Thomas Wiese, 34, and Thomas Bruder, 37, in the days and weeks
following the brutal incident had anything to do with rigging an alibi.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Ronald Fischetti rested his case after Schwarz stepped down
from four hours on the stand. U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson indicated the
case would go to the jury next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, 34, was convicted last year of violating Louima's civil rights by
holding him down during the attack, and faces a possible life sentence. Volpe,
who pleaded guilty in that trial, is serving 30 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz said earlier that at the time the assault occurred, he was outside
the 70th Precinct conducting a routine post-arrest search of his patrol car for
items possibly concealed by a prisoner.
</P>
<P>
	   Vinegrad hammered at Schwarz over the phone calls, some of them lasting
hours, which the government has presented as evidence that the three officers
plotted feverishly to concoct a cover story for Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
	   The former cop insisted that while they discussed press coverage and
speculated on where the investigation might be heading, they were not trying to
conjure up an alibi for him. He said he could not recall many details of
conversations from years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, Schwarz told the Brooklyn federal court jury he would
not expect other cops to lie to protect him, particularly Wiese, his former
patrol partner.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would never do something like that - to ask a man with two children to
put himself in harm's way for me," Schwarz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz contended it was relatively rare for police officers to cover up
each other's misdeeds - forming what is often called the "blue wall of silence."
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not saying it doesn't exist ... but my feeling is that if there's real
criminal misconduct, most cops will not like something like that," he said. "If
you mean is it rampant, I'd say no."
</P>
<P>
	   "And no one has ever done that for you?" asked Vinegrad.
</P>
<P>
	   "No, sir," Schwarz replied.

<HEADLINE> Flutie: 'We Would Have Won'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TORONTO (AP) -- Doug Flutie is sure there would have been no Music City
Miracle if he had started the Buffalo Bills' wild-card playoff game against the
Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
	   Flutie remains bitter about the circumstances surrounding his demotion in
favor of Rob Johnson in the Jan. 8 game, and the quarterback let his feelings be
known in an interview with a Canadian television network.
</P>
<P>
	   "I honestly believe that if I would have been playing, we could have, would
have, won," Flutie said in an interview to be aired Saturday night on TSN. "It
probably was the most frustrating, most miserable week I've ever spent in
football. It was hard to understand and difficult to deal with."
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans won 22-16 in the final seconds on a trick play on a kickoff
return.
</P>
<P>
	   Flutie said that in meetings with NFL players since the season ended,
response has been "unanimous that I got shafted."
</P>
<P>
	   "I sort of shook my head and chuckled," Flutie said of his reaction when
Bills coach Wade Phillips told him five days before the game that Johnson would
be starting.
</P>
<P>
	   "I should have known better. I should have expected it. I've been through it
before. Just when you start to feel comfortable and trust people in this
league..."
</P>
<P>
	   As for the recent release of a trio of Bills stars -- Bruce Smith, Thurman
Thomas and Andre Reed -- Flutie called it "a joke."
</P>
<P>
	   "I shake my head, I really do," Flutie said. "They were all necessary in the
eyes of our management, but it's no longer about who the best player is for the
job in terms of personnel. It's not about putting the best product on the
field."
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the pain of being demoted at a crucial time, Flutie said he did want
to ask for a trade.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was frustrated and angry and I thought about trying to force their hands,
but it made no sense," he said. "I know the offense, I know the players. I'm 37.
I don't feel like going anywhere else. I'll get my opportunity."

<HEADLINE> Alleged ecstasy drug network smashed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A lengthy investigation by a host of agencies has led to
the dismantling of a multi-million dollar network that smuggled the popular
"club drug" ecstasy into New York and several other states, authorities said.
<P>
	   A total of 61 people were under arrest or being sought, all allegedly part
of an international ring that conducted business in New York, California,
Florida, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Authorities said
Wednesday they believe the drugs were smuggled into the United States by six
Israeli nationals.
</P>
<P>
	   The ring, operating out of an apartment in the Forest Hills section of
Queens, allegedly poured 100,000 ecstasy tablets a week into the New York
metropolitan region from the Netherlands and Belgium, said Queens District
Attorney Richard A. Brown. Authorities have seized 300,000 tablets worth an
estimated $7.5 million, and $550,000 in cash, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   "With these arrests we hope to drive home the message that, despite its
name, this drug is a nightmare for users and dealers alike," Brown said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ecstasy is a hybrid of the hallucinogen mescaline and the stimulant
amphetamine chemically known as MDMA. It has been shown in previous studies to
cause brain damage in animals at doses similar to those used by humans.
</P>
<P>
	   The drug, also known as XTC or X, has become the most popular of the
so-called club drugs, said Donnie R. Marshall, acting administrator of the Drug
Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   "This case demonstrates that the Netherlands and Belgium have become the
main location for manufacturing and exporting MDMA," Marshall said. "To add to
the globalization of this problem, Israeli and Russian organized crime
syndicates have gained control of the smuggling of MDMA from Europe into the
U.S."
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities began focusing in on the ring after two undercover investigators
learned that an Israeli national living in Forest Hills - identified as Oshri
Amar - was allegedly selling large quantities of ecstasy. Undercover agents
purchased tablets from Amar, and then received court authorization to install
wiretaps on Amar's telephone and other telephones controlled by his alleged
associates, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
	   Over several months, Amar and his associates allegedly engaged in hundreds
of wholesale transactions in several states. They allegedly paid between $1 and
$2 per tablet, and then charged $6 to $8 per pill, Brown said. The tablets
usually sell for $20 to $30 apiece at clubs, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 61 defendants, 32 were either arrested Wednesday or were being sought
in New York, Pennsylvania and Florida. Amar was one of the defendants being
sought, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Five defendants were previously arrested. In addition, 24 people were either
arrested or were being sought in the Providence, R.I., area.
</P>
<P>
	   All the defendants were charged with conspiracy to sell and distribute a
controlled substance, and various counts of criminal possession and/or sale of a
controlled substance. Each faces up to 25 years to life in prison if convicted.

<HEADLINE> McCain Plane's Wheel Gets Stuck  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BREMERTON, Wash. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain's campaign was delayed Wednesday
night after his plane got stuck in the mud for about two hours as it prepared to
fly to Sacramento, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain and his wife, Cindy, napped part of the time while waiting on board.
Nobody was hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilot of the 727 had been taxing for takeoff and apparently cut short a
left turn, dragging the plane's left rear wheels through a muddy, grassy island
in the runway. The wheels came to rest next to a landing light, a quarter of
their height buried in mud.
</P>
<P>
	   Workers dug out the landing light and put down wooden planks to help the
plane escape.
</P>
<P>
	   After two hours the passengers were asked to leave to lighten the load so
the pilot could fire up the engines and push the plane out of the mud.
</P>
<P>
	   The passengers waited in three buses, and at 9:40 p.m. PST a cheer went up
as the plane roared free of its muddy captivity.
</P>
<P>
	   If the landing gear checked out as undamaged, the plan was for the plane to
fly on to Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain made appearances Wednesday in Spokane, Seattle and Bremerton, a Navy
town about 15 miles west of Seattle on Puget Sound.

<HEADLINE> Human Remains Found in Andes  </HEADLINE>
   By MIGUEL GIL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRES QUEBRADAS, Argentina (AP) -- Tattered scraps of clothes and a severed
hand eerily mummified by the cold. Human bones and the engine of a British plane
that vanished long ago in a snowstorm in the Andes mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   These are the clues to a story that couldn't be told for more than half a
century -- until now. Two Argentine mountaineers have discovered the 1947 crash
site of a British plane, and a 17-member army expedition has wrapped up an
investigation of the accident.
</P>
<P>
	   For years, the question of what happened to the British Avro Lancastrian was
one of the great aviation mysteries of these perilous peaks so high they are
shrouded in snow and freezing temperatures all year round.
</P>
<P>
	   Operated by the now defunct British South American Airways, the plane was
carrying 11 people -- five crew members and six passengers -- and was headed to
Santiago, Chile, when it disappeared on Aug. 2, 1947. The passengers included
three Britons, a German, a Palestinian and a Swiss.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, two mountaineers climbing the 21,848-foot Tupungato volcano
stumbled upon the site.
</P>
<P>
	   Interviewed earlier this week by the newspaper Clarin, Pablo Reguera and
Fernando Garmendia said they never imagined they would find a Rolls Royce engine
more than 16,000 feet up the rocky slopes -- as if dumped casually on a junk
heap in the sky.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Look at the engine over there,'' Reguera remembers calling out to his
climbing buddy, who took a snapshot of him posing with his ice pick beside the
dented find. As he recounted for Clarin, the two tried to make light of the
disturbing discovery, joking with each other: ``How could anyone have gotten a
car up here?''
</P>
<P>
	   But it clearly was a plane engine, and all around lay the remnants of
disaster: shredded bits and pieces of wings and fuselage, frayed cables and a
portion of a seat with what looked like a parachute attached.
</P>
<P>
	   They also saw the human remains and torn clothing. After completing their
climb, they called the authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge, upon hearing the news, ordered the military expedition.
</P>
<P>
	   Four-wheel drive vehicles, mules and mountaineers who could map a tortuous
route up the volcano's rocky slopes were called in. The air force took advantage
of fair weather in the southern hemisphere summer and sent helicopters to the
site.
</P>
<P>
	   After days of work, Army Lt. Col. Ricardo Bustos announced Wednesday that
the army team was concluding its operation and bringing down torsos, bones and
other remains of at least three of the victims.
</P>
<P>
	   Bustos did not identify the victims except to say that the remains from one
woman were found at the site. Busto said the group also had recovered pieces of
the engine, landing gear and parts of the cabin from the debris-strewn slope
16,500 feet up the volcano.
</P>
<P>
	   The group spent several days investigating the site, reachable only by a
difficult climb. One member of the army expedition had to be flown out by
helicopter after suffering breathing problems in the nearly oxygen-bereft
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
	   For years, during the early pioneering days of aviation, the Andes mountain
range was a virtual graveyard for planes.
</P>
<P>
	   The last message from the plane has puzzled aviation investigators for
years. Radio operators in Chile reportedly received a Morse code message reading
``STENDEC'' -- an acronym investigators say has no meaning.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the crash, search teams from England, Chile and Argentina combed
the area by air and on skis but found nothing.
</P>
<P>
	   Theories abounded about the plane's disappearance. Some speculated it had
been sabotaged to kill a British diplomatic messenger reportedly on board.
</P>
<P>
	   But severe weather was believed by many to have been the cause. Records
indicate heavy snow fell for three days when the plane vanished over the South
American mountain chain, and aviation experts said the plane -- a converted
World War II bomber -- did not have deicing capabilities and was unfit to travel
through winter conditions.

<HEADLINE> Conflicting Emotions on Austria  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT H. REID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The furor over a far-right party in Austria's ruling
coalition has stirred conflicting emotions in Eastern Europe, whose governments
want to join the European Union but are also protective of their own sovereignty
after decades of Soviet domination.
</P>
<P>
	   Adding to the mix is the presence of influential right-wing -- even
far-right -- parties in EU candidate countries such as Slovakia, Hungary and
Romania, whose views on some issues are not dissimilar to those of Joerg
Haider's Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Some prominent Eastern European politicians, including former Polish
president Lech Walesa, have questioned whether the EU displayed a
double-standard in targeting Austria while at the same time treating former
Communists as members of the European family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am glad Europe is cautious,'' Walesa told a radio station in Gdansk,
Poland, after the 14 other EU members decided to downgrade official contacts
with Austria when the new coalition took power Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
	   But Walesa added: ``We have people here whose links with communism,
communist Poland and its crimes, are much closer and Europe is not protesting.''
</P>
<P>
	   The EU diplomatic measures were imposed because of Haider's opposition to
immigration and past statements sympathetic to aspects of the Nazi regime of
Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
	   Influential figures in Eastern Europe are also concerned about the EU having
imposed collective punishment on a member state because of the choice its people
made in a democratic election.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Oct. 3 balloting, Haider's party finished second with 52 of the 183
parliamentary seats. When coalition talks with the top-finishing Social
Democrats broke down, People's Party leader Wolfgang Schuessel struck a deal
with Haider.
</P>
<P>
	   To conservatives and nationalists in Eastern Europe, the EU move is
reminiscent of the Soviet doctrine that held that Moscow's allies did not have
the right to choose their own political path if it might undermine the rest of
the Soviet Bloc.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the difference between Soviet invasion and EU diplomatic sanctions
is enormous, the comparison is close enough to cause unease among conservative
politicians with fresh and painful memories of Communist oppression.
</P>
<P>
	   Czech parliament speaker Vaclav Klaus said that although he is concerned
about delays in EU membership, ``I have to respect the will of the Austrian
voters, and I cannot accept what is happening in Europe today.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is very interesting that nobody is protesting the participation of
communists in the government of France and nobody is protesting the fact that
the Italian prime minister (Massimo d'Alema) is a former communist,'' Klaus
said. ``For me, it's just another example of the immense asymmetry which exists
in today's Europe.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Freedom Party's inclusion in the Austrian government, along with the
centrist Austrian People's Party, also set off alarm bells in Eastern Europe --
not so much because of alleged Nazi sympathies as because of Haider's longtime
opposition to bringing the former communist countries into the EU.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the Austrian coalition's official commitment to expansion, Haider
has said the entry of new members should be delayed until the gap between wages
in Eastern Europe and in the EU has been significantly narrowed.
</P>
<P>
	   Otherwise, he argues, European companies will pack up and head eastward,
depriving Austrians and other Western Europeans of their jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Governments in Slovenia, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic -- the
leading EU candidates -- have all spoken out against any delays in EU expansion.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Awaits, Prepares for Pope  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIAN MURPHY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Under scenes depicting Christ's life and his family's
sojourn in Egypt, workers raced to prepare for Pope John Paul II on his own
journey to retrace some of the most epic passages from the Bible.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-day visit, scheduled to begin today, has taken on dual dimensions:
a highly personal pilgrimage for the elderly pontiff and also an opportunity to
promote closer dialogue with Muslims and try to overcome old rifts with Orthodox
Christians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We never could have imagined that we would have the pope under our roof,''
said Samir Yassa, who designed the cathedral where John Paul plans to meet
Friday with Orthodox and Coptic clergymen in a display of their shared roots.
``A brother is returning to a land where Christ walked.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the New Cathedral of Our Lady of Egypt -- opened just two months ago --
crews polished the oak doors and put fresh paint on walls and a 26-foot cross to
be erected next to Islamic-style quilted cloth tarpaulins shading the entrance.
</P>
<P>
	   A murals and towering stained glass windows represent images of the baby
Jesus and his parents, Mary and Joseph, fleeing to Egypt to escape the marauding
King Herod. The tale is central to the traditions of the Orthodox Copts,
caretakers of one of the earliest forms of Christianity and the Church of the
vast majority of Egypt's 6.4 million Christians -- about 10 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a true blessing,'' said Father Farag, the top Coptic cleric in a
Cairo neighborhood that includes a site where Copts believe the Holy Family
temporarily resided.
</P>
<P>
	   Egypt's small Roman Catholic community -- estimated at about 220,000 -- also
feels strong links to the Holy Family's exile story although the embellished
Coptic version of miracles and vivid events does not appear in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
	   John Paul, making his first visit to Egypt and the 90th foreign trip of his
22-year papacy, insists his agenda is ``purely religious, not political.'' But
all gestures by the 79-year-old pontiff have the potential to reverberate
through the volatile mix of beliefs across the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cairo, the pope plans a Mass and meetings with Coptic Orthodox Pope
Shenouda III and Sheik Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, one of the most influential
Muslim clerics in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
	   Clashes in January between Muslims and Copts in southern Egypt left 23
people dead. The pope could use his influence to press for reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
	   Tantawi is also an important catalyst for dialogue between Muslims and
Christians. As chief cleric of Al-Azhar University, a venerable seat of learning
throughout the Muslim world, Tantawi carries influence that stretches far
outside Egypt's borders.
</P>
<P>
	   The stalled Middle East peace process could also get an indirect boost from
the pope's presence in mostly Muslim Egypt, said Samir Morcos, associate general
secretary of the Middle East Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This could help bring more support for Arabs in the process,'' he said.
``This could help move things along.''
</P>
<P>
	   The pope angered Israeli officials earlier this month by describing Israel's
control of Jerusalem as ``morally and legally unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, the pope is scheduled to travel to the St. Catherine monastery,
a nearly 1,500-year-old Greek Orthodox outpost in the shadow of Mount Sinai,
where Scripture says God presented Moses with the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
	   The desert range, about 150 miles southeast of Cairo, is the first of the
major biblical sites on the pope's itinerary for his millennium pilgrimage. Next
month, he plans to visit Bethlehem and Jerusalem as part of a tour of Israel and
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
	   The tour was to have begun with a controversial stop in Ur, an ancient city
believed to be the birthplace of Abraham, in present-day Iraq. But the Iraq trip
fell through when Baghdad balked.
</P>
<P>
	   The monastery visit also presents the pope with another chance in his desire
to close the nearly 1,000-year split between the Vatican and Orthodox churches,
which separated following disputes over papal authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Greek and Russian Orthodox leaders have been mostly hostile to any
rapprochement. The Vatican last year suspended discussions on a possible papal
visit to biblical sites in Greece after Orthodox clerics sharply criticized the
idea.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Flee Smoldering City  </HEADLINE>
   By GILBERT DA COSTA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KADUNA, Nigeria (AP) -- An overwhelming stench filled the morgue at this
smoldering city's main hospital, where about 200 bodies were piled up on slabs,
on the floor, even the ground outside after two days of religious clashes.
</P>
<P>
	   More bodies -- many of them charred -- littered the streets, where smoke
wafted Wednesday from burned buildings and the remnants of bonfires built during
the rioting.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds grabbed what belongings they could and set off on foot to escape
the scene of the fighting, which erupted Monday morning during a demonstration
by local Christians against a proposal to bring Islamic law, or sharia, to
Kaduna state.
</P>
<P>
	   Guns, cutlasses and other weapons were used in the clashes, which continued
into Tuesday, said workers sifting through the bodies at the morgue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People, especially the Christians in my area, were slaughtered like
chickens and goats,'' said Nkechi Nwosu, a Christian, who sought refuge with her
15-year-old son at the Army Referral Hospital. ``I haven't seen anything like
this in the 10 years I have lived in the city.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police played down the death toll and maintained that just 13 bodies had
been recovered.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no reports of fighting Wednesday, but looting continued in some
neighborhoods despite a curfew that kept all residents inside except between 8
a.m. and noon.
</P>
<P>
	   While most stores were closed, residents who decided to stay in the city
raced to those that were open, stocking up on supplies before the curfew went
back into affect. Others gathered at police and military facilities for
protection.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of thousands of people live in Kaduna, one of the largest cities in
northern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
	   Police reinforcements were brought in from five neighboring states, and
soldiers also fanned out through the city to contain the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharia has become an increasingly divisive issue in Nigeria, a nation of 120
million sharply divided along ethnic, religious and geographic lines -- and
where those divisions regularly flare into bloody battles.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, sharia officially went into affect in neighboring Zamfara state,
which is overwhelmingly Muslim. Niger state, south of Kaduna, and Sokoto state
to the northwest passed their own sharia bills on Tuesday and Wednesday
respectively.
</P>
<P>
	   A number of other states in Nigeria's largely Muslim north -- including
Kaduna, which is about 40 percent Christian -- are also considering following
suit.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharia supporters across the North have assured non-Muslims they will not be
tried under the Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
	   But such assurances have meant little to Christians, who fear becoming
marginalized or discriminated against. Their fears are fed by the country's
newspapers in the largely Christian south, which have filled pages with dire
warnings of the punishments Christians will face.
</P>
<P>
	   Muslim law prohibits such things as drinking alcohol and also calls for
separate schools and public transportation for men and women. Islamic courts
have been established to hold trials and mete out punishment to Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   Recently, one man was lashed 80 times in Zamfara state for drinking alcohol.
</P>
<P>
	   An emergency debate in Parliament's lower house degenerated into a shouting
match Wednesday, as Christians and Muslims argued over the constitutionality of
sharia and sought to blame each other for the clashes in Kaduna.
</P>
<P>
	   The House of Representatives finally passed a motion condemning the fighting
and supporting the deployment of soldiers to contain the violence. A hastily
added amendment asked the justice minister to refer the question of sharia to
the Supreme Court for interpretation.
</P>
<P>
	   Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, elected a year ago after 15 years of
military rule, has remained largely silent on the issue, apparently afraid of
sparking an even larger crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, his only comment was to condemn the violence as ``not only
criminal but highly unpatriotic.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we need most now is love, caring for each other and joining of hands
to rebuild the nation together,'' Obasanjo said in an address on national
television. ``Let us bind our wounds and accept the challenge of the time.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, a prominent Nigerian lawyer and human rights activist filed
a suit asking the Zamfara state high court in Gusau to declare sharia
unconstitutional. No date has been set for the suit, filed by Olisa Agbakoba on
behalf of the Human Rights Law Services group.

<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Colombia took advantage of two major defensive lapses,
including Marcial Salazar's own goal, to beat Peru 2-1 on Wednesday night in the
semifinals of the Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
	   The own goal by Salazar late in the first half gave Colombia a 1-0 lead. The
Colombians scored again early in the second half when Victor Bonilla walked in
for an uncontested goal after a pass by Peru defender Juan Reynoso slipped
through the hands of goaltender Oscar Ibanez.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombia advances to Sunday's final in Los Angeles against the winner of
Thursday night's semifinal match between Canada and Trinidad &AMP; Tobago.
</P>
<P>
	   The South American teams battled through a first half where that had few
scoring chances. The tone of the match changed, however, when Colombia's Arley
Dinas headed a corner kick toward Ibanez.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the goaltender could make a play, Salazar stuck his left leg out in
an attempt to deflect the ball. Instead, the ball sliced off the defender's leg
into the goal in the 39th minute.
</P>
<P>
	   Another defensive mistake by Peru proved costly in the 53rd minute when
Reynoso chested a ball back toward Ibanez. The Peruvian goalie, who was moving
toward the ball, let it slide through his hands. Bonilla took the ball and
easily scored what proved to be the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
	   Peru's only goal came on Roberto Palacios' kick into the high left corner in
the 75th minute.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A storm packing tornado-like bursts of wind and driving
rain damaged buildings, snarled highways and was blamed for two fatal traffic
crashes in southern California on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The wind bursts, which authorities compared to the power of tornados, peeled
the roofs off two buildings and uprooted a 65-foot pine tree in Los Angeles,
said Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
	   The California Highway Patrol said there were more than 570 accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm dumped 1.43 inches of rain on Burbank and left up to 8 inches of
fresh snow in Big Bear, which was bracing for an early weekend influx of skiers.
</P>
<P>
	   At the beach near Topanga Canyon north of Los Angeles, lifeguards rescued
two wind surfers from the choppy waters of the Pacific Ocean, while an afternoon
mudslide blocked one lane of Interstate 405 between the San Fernando Valley and
the city's west side.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow that began falling at higher elevations Wednesday night also led to the
closure of Interstate 5, a major link connecting Los Angeles to San Francisco.
The highway was closed in both directions over the mountainous Grapevine pass,
the state Department of Transportation reported.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Only so much meditation and prayer can help a
1,500-year-old monastery in dire need of a face lift. The Shaolin have come up
with a more worldly solution.
</P>
<P>
	   They packed up 20 Buddhist monks skilled in martial arts from their secluded
monastery in the mountains of central China and headed for Sin City.
</P>
<P>
	   The monks didn't count on winning any jackpots -- the monks, after all,
don't gamble -- but they did bet that a show featuring sword fights and walking
on knives would sell in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
	   After all, everything else does.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Las Vegas is not just a city of gambling,'' said Jian Wang, the monks'
manager and interpreter. ``It's a city of entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
	   For this month's two-week run at the MGM Grand hotel-casino, the monks
perform kung fu in unison, walk on knives, break granite with their hands and
snap iron bars over their heads.
</P>
<P>
	   The Shaolin monks follow a strict and chaste routine of meditation, prayer
and martial arts training. There are no televisions and no drinking and
gambling.
</P>
<P>
	   So why come to the city of excess, where alcohol, gambling and strippers are
everywhere?
</P>
<P>
	   Wang said the visit will not only to help their monastery financially, but
also serve as a cultural exchange. The Shaolin monks are considered the jewels
of China, and the Chinese government gave its blessing to allow them to travel
to Las Vegas, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As a monk, you take every corner of the world as your home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Las Vegas has not only been an eye-opener for the monks. The monks, who
always wear robes, usually orange, have gotten more than a few stares as they
walk through the casino.
</P>
<P>
	   They recently toured Hoover Dam, ventured out on the Strip and even rode a
roller coaster.
</P>
<P>
	   And what about an urge to slip a quarter in that nearby slot machine?
</P>
<P>
	   Doesn't happen, the monks say.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's no problem,'' said monk Shi Yan-Wen.

<HEADLINE> Canucks 4, Mighty Ducks 4  </HEADLINE>
    By KEN PETERS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Ladislav Kohn scored with 4:17 remaining in the
second period Wednesday to lift the Anaheim Mighty Ducks to a 4-4 tie with
Vancouver in the Canucks' first game since Marty McSorley struck Vancouver's
Donald Brashear with his stick.
</P>
<P>
	   McSorley, the Boston Bruins' enforcer who blindsided Brashear Monday night
in Vancouver, was suspended earlier Wednesday for the rest of the season. In the
harshest punishment ever handed down by the NHL, McSorley will miss 23
regular-season games and also will be banned from the playoffs should the Bruins
make it.
</P>
<P>
	   Brashear, who fell and hit the back of his head on the ice after the blow to
the side of his head, received a concussion that will sideline him for several
weeks and possibly the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Anaheim's Teemu Selanne had a goal and two assists in the seesaw game
against the Canucks.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohn pulled the Mighty Ducks even with his fourth goal, scoring from the
crease after his first shot was blocked by the defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Matt Cooke put Vancouver up 4-3 midway through the second period, picking up
the loose puck just outside the crease and beating goalie Dominic Roussel to the
stick side for his fourth goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Rucchin's 14th goal, on a power play at 3:04 of the second, had drawn
Anaheim even after Markus Naslund had given the Canucks a 3-2 lead with his 19th
goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Anaheim jumped out to a 2-0 lead on power play-goals by Oleg Tverdovsky, his
10th, and Selanne, his 25th. The Canucks answered with two goals before the
first period ended.

<HEADLINE> 'ER' Reaches Ratings Milestone  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- It went almost unnoticed with all the noise about
millionaires and instant brides, but NBC's "ER" reached a milestone last week
that proved it has a very loyal audience.
</P>
<P>
	   The medical drama's episode a week go, in which Kellie Martin's character
died after being stabbed the previous week, drew the most viewers for any
regular entertainment series since the "Seinfeld" finale in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 39 million people watched "ER" last week. That's more than any episode
of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" has ever drawn and more than twice the
audience of Fox's special, "Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire."
</P>
<P>
	   NBC was also helped by the crossover editions of "Law &AMP; Order" and "Law &AMP;
Order: Special Victims Unit," which scored the network its best Friday night
ratings since 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with all that good ratings news, ABC still won the week with a
prime-time average of 15 million viewers (9.7 rating, 16 share). The reason?
Three editions of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" were the second, third and
fourth most-watched shows of the week.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC is certain to win the February ratings "sweeps" period, but is still
locked in a tight battle with NBC for dominance among the 18-to-49-year-old
audience that advertisers prize.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox's "Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire" drew 16 million viewers and
was particularly a hit among young women. But with the marriage on the rocks
after a week and Fox taking heat for not knowing its bridegroom was accused of
hitting an ex-girlfriend, it's an empty victory for the network.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC was the runner-up in the ratings race with 14 million average viewers
(9.6 rating, 16 share), CBS had 12.6 million viewers (8.7, 14), Fox had 11.2
million (7.3, 12), UPN had 4.1 million (2.7, 4), the WB had 3.7 million (2.7, 4)
and Pax TV had 1 million (0.8, 1).
</P>
<P>
	   The evening news ratings race was nearly a dead heat. ABC's "World News
Tonight" had 11.1 million viewers (8.0 rating, 16 share) and NBC's "Nightly
News" had 11 million viewers (8.0, 16). The "CBS Evening News" had 9.1 million
viewers (6.8, 13).
</P>
<P>
	   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of the nation's
estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the percentage of in-use
televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
	   For the week of Feb. 14-20, the top 10 shows, their networks and ratings
were "ER," NBC, 25.0; "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" (Sunday), ABC, 18.1; "Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire" (Thursday), ABC, 18.0; "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire" (Tuesday), ABC, 17.9; "Friends," NBC, 16.7; "Frasier," NBC, 14.2;
"The Practice," ABC, 13.6; "Law &AMP; Order" special, NBC, 13.2; 'Frasier" special,
NBC, 12.9; "Law &AMP; Order," NBC, 12.8.

<HEADLINE> Malaria's Drug Resistance Studied  </HEADLINE>
    By RICK CALLAHAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A mutation-prone gene in the malaria parasite apparently plays a key role in
the deadly organism's growing resistance to drugs, according to a report in
today's issue of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings could help researchers design new drugs to combat the
mosquito-borne parasite, which kills more than a million people a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in
Melbourne and Australian National University in Canberra studied Plasmodium
falciparum, malaria's deadliest strain, and found that the mutated gene prevents
antimalarial drugs from accumulating within the parasite.
</P>
<P>
	   Somehow, the mutations allow the parasite to either block drugs from
entering or quickly pump them out, said Alan Cowman, chief of the division of
infection and immunity at the Hall Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   "The drugs only kill the parasite if they get concentrated inside it. Now
it's clear that these mutations prevent that accumulation from occurring,"
Cowman said.
</P>
<P>
	   He and colleagues reported that the mutated gene gives the parasites varying
resistance to five drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   The faulty gene, known as pfmdr1, has long been suspected of giving the
parasite resistance to drugs. But studies conflicted over whether it truly plays
any role.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, Cowman said his team has found direct proof that mutations in the gene
give the parasite resistance to the drugs quinine, mefloquinine and halofantrine
and also influence resistance to chloroquine and artemisinin.
</P>
<P>
	   Cowman said it is clear that another, as yet unknown gene plays a role in
giving malaria resistance to chloroquine and artemisinin.
</P>
<P>
	   His team came to its conclusions by genetically splicing the mutated gene
into malaria parasites not naturally resistant to drugs. The team then bred
those parasites and tested them against each drug.
</P>
<P>
	   Donald Krogstad, chairman of tropical medicine at Tulane University in New
Orleans, said the finding that the mutated gene influences resistance to up to
five drugs is worrisome.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bottom line for the public here is that if you get those mutations in
the parasite you're carrying, you've trashed three to four drugs at once, rather
than just one. That's very disturbing," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Malaria is a major drain on the economies of developing nations,
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   The standard, inexpensive treatment for malaria had been chloroquine, but it
was among the first antimalarials the parasite became resistant to, said William
Rogers, director of preclinical research and development for the Naval Medical
Research Center's malaria program in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
	   "When it began losing its effectiveness it pushed the cost of treatment up
five- or 10-fold. It's a major, major problem," he said.

<HEADLINE> Medical Journal Apologizes  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDA A. JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The prestigious New England Journal of Medicine admitted today that it
violated its financial conflict-of-interest policy 19 times over the past three
years in its selection of doctors to review new drug treatments.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston-based weekly journal, considered one of the world's premier
medical publications, disclosed in today's issue that it let doctors who had
financial ties to the drug makers write the articles.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was carelessness on our part," Dr. Marcia Angell, editor in chief since
September, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   The internal review was prompted by a news report about one such violation
last fall. It found 18 additional instances since January 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The violations involve the journal's "Drug Therapy" feature, a series of
reviews of the latest drug treatments for particular illnesses. In each case,
the journal failed to disqualify authors even though they had revealed their
financial ties up front, Angell said.
</P>
<P>
	   Angell said the journal solicits authors to write the reviews but is
supposed to bar those have directly or indirectly received "major research
support" or payment as a consultant from companies that make drugs prominently
discussed in those articles.
</P>
<P>
	   The "Drug Therapy" series is overseen by an outside editor, Dr. Alistair
J.J. Wood, a pharmacology professor at Vanderbilt University.
</P>
<P>
	   Angell said Wood disqualified authors who personally received significant
research funding from the maker of drugs discussed prominently in an article,
but failed to disqualify authors whose institutions received such grants or
authors who served as consultants to the drug companies. She said some in-house
editors knew of the practice and overlooked it.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she suspects there were violations before 1997, too, but the
in-house review went back only three years. Wood has been editing the series for
about a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to readers, Angell apologized for the lapse and said steps have
been taken to ensure against any recurrence. She said no action was taken
against Wood. He and a deputy editor who helps edit the series also signed the
letter.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter listed the 18 newly uncovered articles along with the drug
makers, which ranged from little-known biotech companies to pharmaceutical
giants like Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck &AMP; Co., Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn and
Wyeth-Ayerst.
</P>
<P>
	   The journal regularly publishes original, unsolicited articles on clinical
trials of particular drugs written by academic scientists who have received
major research funding from a drug manufacturer involved. In those cases, the
article notes those funding sources at the end.
</P>
<P>
	   Angell said the stricter policy for review articles is difficult to maintain
because "there's so much connection between academia and the private sector
now."

<HEADLINE> Marrow Exam May Help Cancer Victims  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDA A. JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Looking for malignant cells in the bone marrow of women undergoing breast
cancer surgery may help doctors better predict patients' chances of survival,
according to a study in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors now assess a patient's odds by two means: gauging the size of the
tumor, and removing and examining some of the lymph nodes in the armpit for
signs the cancer has spread.
</P>
<P>
	   The new study conducted in Germany raises the possibility that the bone
marrow is an even better predictor of the chances of a relapse or a cure.
</P>
<P>
	   Used together, the three methods could help doctors decide with more
precision which patients should get aggressive chemotherapy after surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the second large study to suggest that bone marrow is an important
predictor," said Dr. Michael Osborne, director of the Strang-Cornell Breast
Center in New York and the first researcher credited with the discovery. "It may
have significant potential to improve breast cancer treatment."
</P>
<P>
	   Typically, chemotherapy is given after surgery to patients who are thought
to have a high risk of a relapse. That usually means women who had large tumors
or whose cancer has spread to adjacent lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet, the lymph nodes are not an especially reliable predictor. In 20 percent
to 30 percent of patients with cancer-free nodes, breast cancer re-emerges
elsewhere in the body within a decade. And 40 percent of those with cancerous
lymph nodes are fine 10 years later.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest work was conducted by Dr. Wolfgang Janni and others from Ludwig
Maximilians University in Munich. They followed 552 women with breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   After four years, those whose cancer had spread to the bone marrow by the
time of breast surgery were 4.2 times more likely to have died or to have a
relapse than those who had no cancer cells in their marrow. Women whose cancer
had spread to lymph nodes were 2.9 times as likely to have died or relapsed as
those with healthy lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
	   Osborne is nearing the end of a 10-year follow-up -- the point at which
breast cancer patients are considered unlikely to have a relapse -- on a few
hundred patients from his original study. He said if those results and another
large, lengthy study under way confirm the German group's findings, doctors will
have another means of tailoring treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   The German researchers withdrew bone marrow from the hips of 743
anesthetized patients with suspected breast or gynecological cancer at the same
time as surgery to remove a tumor.
</P>
<P>
	   Of 552 women who had malignant breast tumors, 36 percent had cancer cells in
their marrow, compared with 1 percent of those with benign tumors. Among the 199
women who had cancer cells in their marrow, 25 percent died during the study,
compared with only 6 percent of those with cancer-free marrow.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Robert Wieder, a cancer specialist at New Jersey Medical School in
Newark, called the study a landmark but said more research is needed to learn
whether chemotherapy will save the lives of women who have cancer in their bone
marrow but not their lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Larry Norton, chief of medical oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in New York, said it is premature to start taking bone marrow -- a
painful procedure -- from all breast cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Norton noted that hundreds of possible predictors of whether cancer will
return or kill have been proposed over the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most don't pan out," Norton said. "What makes this one little more
interesting is it corroborates the work of others."
</P>
<P>
	   In an editorial in the journal, Dr. Barbara Smith of Massachusetts General
Hospital said that knowing the status of the lymph nodes and marrow also could
help doctors spare some patients the side effects of chemotherapy by finding
those at lowest risk of the cancer spreading.

<HEADLINE> Assisted Suicides Increase in Oregon  </HEADLINE>
   By BRAD CAIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SALEM, Ore. (AP) -- While 27 terminally ill people used the nation's only
assisted suicide law to end their lives last year, doctors say only one in 10
requests for lethal prescriptions resulted in a suicide.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings were contained in separate studies published in today's New
England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Oregon physicians are responding in a careful and prudent manner when
patients request assisted suicide,'' said Dr. Linda Ganzini, the chief author of
the study about lethal prescription requests and director of geriatric
psychiatry at the Portland VA Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
	   First approved in 1994 and reaffirmed by Oregon voters in 1997, the law
allows a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose of barbiturates to patients who have
less than six months to live.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixteen Oregon residents used the Death with Dignity Act in 1998; most of
the 27 who used it last year were older cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
	   The did so out of a desire to have some control over the way they die,
according to Oregon health officials said reports from doctors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although concern about possible abuses persist, our data indicate that
poverty, lack of education or health insurance and poor care at the end of life
were not important factors in patients' requests for assistance with suicide,''
according to the other journal study.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of Oregon's law say it is immoral to have doctors assist in
suicides. An effort is under way in Congress to derail it and to prevent other
states from passing similar laws.
</P>
<P>
	   While backers of assisted suicide said the reports show the law is working
as intended, opponents disagreed.
</P>
<P>
	   One critic, Dr. William Breitbart, chief of psychiatry service at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, suggested that doctors might withhold
reports on assisted suicides that do not go well.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Gregory Hamilton of Physicians for Compassionate Care said the research
fails to mention a case in which a man who intentionally took a lethal dose was
resuscitated by emergency medical crews because his wife didn't want him to die.
Hamilton declined to provide specifics.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Katrina Hedberg, the author of the Oregon Health Division's report, said
she had not heard of the case.
</P>
<P>
	   She said the report showed no complications such as vomiting or seizures
among the 27 patients. On average, most of them were unconscious within 10
minutes, and the majority of patients were dead within three hours or less,
Hedberg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventeen of the 27 who took lethal drugs last year were cancer patients.
The others had chronic lung disease, AIDS or Lou Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The median age of the those who took their lives was 71; all patients had
health insurance and 21 were in hospice care before death.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact is, the patients died peacefully, surrounded by their family
members and friends,'' said George Eighmey, executive director of Compassion in
Dying in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
	   The study focusing on lethal prescription requests found that the small
percentage of Oregon patients who request them actually receive the
prescriptions and end their lives with the medication.
</P>
<P>
	   A survey of more than 2,600 Oregon physicians found that 5 percent of them
had received requests for lethal prescriptions since November 1997 and that only
one in 10 such requests actually resulted in a suicide.

<HEADLINE> Iranians Study Election Results  </HEADLINE>
   By VIJAY JOSHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- After their rout in parliamentary elections, the
question is whether Iran's hard-liners will fight to preserve their power or
accept defeat.
</P>
<P>
	   The first confrontation could come over the reformists' plans to open Iran
to foreign television.
</P>
<P>
	   Hard-liners have been fighting the reform agenda since President Mohammad
Khatami launched his campagin for social and political change in 1997. With
their defeat in Friday's poll, they lost control of one instrument of their
power, Parliament, for the first time in 21 years.
</P>
<P>
	   As the reform movement gathers speed, conservatives will have to choose
between accommodating its agenda and retaining some popularity, or confronting
it outright and losing credibility with a public that has demonstrated
overwhelming support for change.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, the hard-liners ``will use all the legal instruments at their
disposal to resist reforms,'' said Saeed Laylaz, a political analyst and a
columnist for several reformist newspapers.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he said, conservatives will be forced to back down to avoid angering
the public.
</P>
<P>
	   Hard-liners still retain key powers that they can use to frustrate reform,
particularly their control over the 12-member Guardians Council, which has the
power to reject any legislation deemed unconstitutional or un-Islamic.
</P>
<P>
	   The Islamic Iran Participation Front, the biggest party in the reformist
coalition, says one of its priorities in Parliament will be to lift a 6-year ban
on satellite dish antennas. The hard-liners could reject that. The ban is
supported by the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the
final word on all matters.
</P>
<P>
	   Khamenei, however, could be a calming influence.
</P>
<P>
	   Although associated with the conservatives, he has shown in recent months
that he would rather avoid a confrontation with the reformists.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, he ordered hard-line clerics to end their protest over a
newspaper cartoon lampooning a cleric.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month he pardoned former Tehran Mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi, a
prominent reformist who was jailed for alleged corruption in a trial widely seen
as politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
	   In October, he criticized hard-liners who called for the death of two
playwrights who wrote an allegedly blasphemous play. On Wednesday, the newspaper
Entekhab reported that Khamenei had pardoned the playwrights.
</P>
<P>
	   The hard-liners already appear resigned to their fate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Conservatives have to regroup and reorganize themselves, identify their
weak points and re-enter politics with a new plan,'' Kamal Daneshyar, a defeated
hard-line candidate, said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People want greater freedom in social and personal issues. The policies
enforced so far have failed,'' Daneshyar was quoted as saying by Aftab-e-Emruz
newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Even hard-liners are often pragmatists: Most of those in power today were
leaders in the 1979 revolution and remember how popular outrage helped bring
down the monarchy. Since the revolution, the clergy has been careful of when to
back down over unpopular measures.
</P>
<P>
	   The election was an endorsement of Khatami's reform agenda. His allies have
won 141 of the 195 seats for which results have been declared. Hard-liners won
44, and independents won 10.
</P>
<P>
	   There are 290 seats in the Majlis, or Parliament. Results from Tehran's 30
seats are expected to be announced today, and 65 other seats will be decided in
run-offs.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say the reformists are much more likely than the hard-liners to
have trouble presenting a united front.
</P>
<P>
	   The reformists are split into 18 parties, including leftists who will oppose
economic liberalization for a country desperately in need of investment. There
are those who disagree with the Participation Front on the speed of reforms. The
Front wants to go full speed to appease the youth who overwhelmingly voted for
them.
</P>
<P>
	   That may not go down well with some reformists who would not meddle with the
compulsory ``hijab,'' which requires women to be covered in public, with only
their hands and faces showing.
</P>
<P>
	   Women in this deeply religious country accept the hijab with varying degrees
of compliance. Some have head scarves barely covering the head, and others are
so fully draped that only half the face is seen.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our feet are firmly rooted in tradition but our heads are in modernism,''
said Laylaz, who admitted he would not like his wife to discard the hijab.

<HEADLINE> Organic Pasta Products Demanded  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN MacDONALD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FARGO, N.D. (AP) -- North Dakota's largest pasta cooperative, taking note of
consumer demand, is planning a line of pasta made from organically grown durum.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dakota Growers Pasta Co. is trying to find enough farmers to grow the
wheat variety to meet organic standards.
</P>
<P>
	   "Organic pasta hasn't been something with any popularity up until now, so
there just haven't been a lot of people growing durum organically," said Tim
Dodd, president and general manager of the Carrington-based co-op. "But
consumers are demanding it now, and some of our customers want us to produce
it."
</P>
<P>
	   The member-owned Dakota Growers makes and sells pasta products under its own
label, and also makes pasta for other companies to sell under their brand names.
</P>
<P>
	   Dodd said those companies, apparently because of pressure from consumers,
have approached the cooperative about an organic variety of pasta.
</P>
<P>
	   Cooperative officials have been talking to both members and nonmembers,
trying to find a pool of farmers willing to grow limited supplies of durum
organically, without the use of chemicals or genetic changes.
</P>
<P>
	   Fred Kirschenmann, a Medina organic farmer and co-founder of Farm Verified
Organic, a business that certifies organic farming practices, has been working
closely with Dakota Growers.
</P>
<P>
	   He said organic farmers are very interested in growing durum for the co-op,
and he predicted a bumper crop of organic durum in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're excited that Dakota Growers is showing interest in organic pasta,"
Kirschenmann said. "The interest among farmers is already there. All Dakota
Growers needs to do is tell us how much they want us to grow."
</P>
<P>
	   Consumers have been gobbling up organic products at an unprecedented rate,
apparently worried about farm chemicals and genetically altered crops. While the
federal Agriculture Department continues to grapple with how to legally define
"organic," the industry has boomed, with sales of $6 billion last year,
according to the Organic Trade Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Dodd said Dakota Growers briefly produced a line of organic semolina, the
durum flour used to make pasta, in the early 1990s for sale to other pasta
makers. The product was abandoned because of poor sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Dodd said the cooperative is willing to try organic products again because
"we recognize consumer demand has changed."
</P>
<P>
	   "In the past, I've never been that excited about organic crops because the
(sales) volume has been so low," he added. "But that trend is changing. People
are concerned about food safety, and some believe organic is the way to go."
</P>
<P>
	   Dodd said the pasta plant already is set up so it could handle production of
a separate, limited line of organic pasta.
</P>
<P>
	   He declined to name the customers who have approached Dakota Growers about

</P>
<P>
	   Kirschenmann already grows a limited amount of organic durum for a Michigan
food company, and said he would be more than willing to expand his crop.
</P>
<P>
	   James Ryan of Balfour, a longtime organic farmer and member of Dakota
Growers, said he has already committed to growing a durum crop organically for
the co-op.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this is a great move for organic farmers and for Dakota Growers,"
he said. "It's an exciting prospect."

<HEADLINE> UNICEF: Poverty Strikes Children  </HEADLINE>
   By AUDREY WOODS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Poverty has imposed a heavy price on children, leaving babies
without mothers, forcing children onto the streets to work and depriving
millions of others of the security of a family, UNICEF says.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Childhood itself is denied to them or, at least, badly damaged,'' said the
report released Wednesday by the United Kingdom committee of UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
	   The report marked the launch of an 18-month campaign by the U.N. children's
agency to help an estimated 100 million children who it says are growing up
outside the protection of a state or a family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whether they are orphaned, unaccompanied, living on the street or working
in servitude, their aloneness is at the heart of their predicament,'' the report
says.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the first of three reports focusing on the reasons children grow up
alone -- the others will deal in more detail with HIV/AIDS and war. UNICEF aims
to raise funds to help prevent and improve children's plight.
</P>
<P>
	   War in the 1990s has separated 1 million children from their families, the
report said. ``We started out the 20th century where the victims of war were
military,'' UNICEF executive director Carol Bellamy told a news conference in
London. ``We've ended the 20th century where the victims of war are women and
children.''
</P>
<P>
	   AIDS is turning parts of Africa into ``a killing field,'' she said, leaving
11 million orphans, a figure expected to rise to 13 million within the year.
</P>
<P>
	   With 1.3 billion people worldwide living on less than $1 a day, poverty is a
major cause of children facing a future alone, and the report drew attention to
ways it impacts children.
</P>
<P>
	   When a family descends into poverty, ``a girl may be `sold' to another
family who provide her with a home in return for heavy domestic duties. A boy
may be sent off to a town hundreds of miles away in the hope that he makes
good,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Minor tragedies, such as illness or unemployment, become the final straw
for poor families, and may mean a child has to leave school and go to work,''
UNICEF said. ``Missing out on education draws them further into the poverty
cycle.''
</P>
<P>
	   Every year, 600,000 women die from preventable complications in childbirth
and leave behind 1 million children who are at much greater risk of illness and
malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
	   Street children are difficult to count, the report noted. But it said India
was believed to have the most, with about 100,000 each in Delhi, Bombay and
Calcutta.
</P>
<P>
	   Africa's street child population is rising rapidly, it said, citing Zambia,
with an estimated increase from 35,000 in 1991 to 75,000 in 1996. In Zambia, 54
percent of children already have lost one or both parents.

Egypt Awaits, Prepares for Pope
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Under scenes depicting Christ's life and his family's
sojourn in Egypt, workers raced to prepare for Pope John Paul II on his own
journey to retrace some of the most epic passages from the Bible. The three-day
visit, scheduled to begin Thursday, has taken on dual dimensions: a highly
personal pilgrimage for the elderly pontiff and also an opportunity to promote
closer dialogue with Muslims and try to overcome old rifts with Orthodox
Christians. "We never could have imagined that we would have the pope under our
roof," said Samir Yassa, who designed the cathedral where John Paul plans to
meet Friday with Orthodox and Coptic clergymen in a display of their shared
roots.

gave him control of a NASA computer system. Ikenna Iffih, 28, a student at
Northeastern University's College of Computer Science, was charged Wednesday
with three counts related to hacking that carry up to 10 years in prison and a
fine of $250,000. "All in all, the defendant used his home computer to leave a
trail of cybercrime from coast to coast," U.S. Attorney Donald Stern said in a

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Carlos Santana, who first gained fame a generation ago
with a searing guitar performance at Woodstock, capped a triumphant comeback
Wednesday with a record-tying eight Grammy Awards. The 52-year-old guitarist's
multi-platinum "Supernatural" won album of the year. His first No. 1 single,
"Smooth," capped a sweep of the major Grammys by winning song and record of the
year. Santana tied Michael Jackson's 1983 record of most Grammys on a single
night. "Music is the vehicle for the magic of healing," he said upon accepting
the album of the year trophy, "and the music of 'Supernatural' was a sign and
designed to bring unity and harmony."

casting the nomination fight as a choice between an inclusive reformer who can
win the White House and a $70 million candidate who appeals mostly to the
establishment. "The great thing about this victory yesterday was that we have

<HEADLINE> WTO Rejects US Appeal on Tax Breaks  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Billions of dollars in tax breaks for U.S. exports have
been ruled an illegal subsidy by the World Trade Organization, but the issue is
far from settled.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, in a statement released by
her office, confirmed that a WTO appellate panel had sided with the European
Union position that the tax breaks program -- the Foreign Sales Corporation
program -- is an illegal subsidy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We strongly disagree with the appellate body's ruling,'' Barshefsky said
Wednesday. ``Our view remains that the FSC is completely consistent with
U.S.-WTO obligations. We respect our WTO obligations, and will seek a solution
that ensures that U.S. firms and workers are not at a competitive disadvantage
with their European counterparts.
</P>
<P>
	   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the United States will not abandon
the program and will pursue negotiations intended to avoid retaliation from the
European Union, which brought the WTO challenge.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers, in an interview Wednesday with The Associated Press, said the
Clinton administration is ``clear in our commitment to finding a way to maintain
the important incentives for U.S. exports that have been provided in the past.
I'm sure we'll find a way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Foreign Sales Corporation program enables U.S. makers of computer
software, chemicals, machinery and many other products to shield some export
income from taxes. The tax breaks for companies such as Microsoft, Boeing and
General Motors would be worth more than $15 billion over the next five years,
according to congressional estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional leaders are urging a negotiated deal, particularly because
changes in the law stemming from the WTO decision would be tricky, costly and
time-consuming. Also, opponents might seize the opportunity in an election year
to attack the program as corporate welfare.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are concerned that if this matter is not resolved bilaterally ... this
is likely to lead to a highly charged tax and trade environment that we are sure
all parties would like to avoid,'' lawmakers, including Sen. William Roth,
R-Del., and Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, said in a recent letter to the
administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The program was created in 1984 to offset tax rebates European companies get
when they sell products outside the EU. It permits U.S. companies to avoid
certain income taxes by setting up export subsidiaries on offshore tax havens
such as the U.S. Virgin Islands, Barbados and Guam.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies that enjoy this tax break are awaiting nervously the WTO
decision. They fear it could lead to another trade war with the Europeans or
require a major rewrite of the U.S. tax code that would reduce the benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We stand to lose tax parity with our trading partners,'' said Steve
Elkins, the top tax official at the Chemical Manufacturers Association. ``And we
stand to be retaliated against through tariffs against U.S. exports.''
</P>
<P>
	   Martin Regalia, economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said an end to
the Foreign Sales Corporation program ``puts our companies at a comparative
disadvantage. We don't want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Europeans, on the other hand, contend the program has reached beyond its
original limits, particularly in 1997 when it was extended to U.S. computer
software makers such as Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU trade commissioner, Pascal Lemy, said recently that the expanded
program was ``granting an unfair advantage to U.S. products'' in many parts of
the world.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear whether the EU would retaliate through higher tariffs if
the United States does not make fundamental changes, and some European companies
benefit from the tax breaks through their U.S. subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, the program could become a bargaining chip in other U.S.-EU
trade disputes over bananas, beef growth hormones and aerospace products. Some
observers also believe the dispute could provide an opening for all of these
issues to be resolved.	   ``We all want to avoid a continuing round of trade
disputes,'' Elkins said. ``We are hopeful that the Europeans will realize it.''

<HEADLINE> French, Maybe U.S., Troops To Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to a call by NATO military commanders to
reinforce the peacekeepers in Kosovo, France is preparing to dispatch an
additional 600 to 700 soldiers, and U.S. Marines may follow.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. official said Wednesday that allied political authorities at NATO
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, were considering whether approximately 1,200
peacekeepers may be needed in addition to the French soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   The official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, said a U.S.
Marine unit was among several allied forces designated for potential use as
reinforcements in Kosovo. But he stressed that no decisions had been made on
increasing U.S. troop involvement in the ethnically divided Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
	   French Defense Minister Alain Richard told a Pentagon news conference
Wednesday that his government had approved sending 600 to 700 more troops to
help quell the rising violence in Kosovska Mitrovica, an ethnically divided city
in northern Kosovo. That represents about one-third of the reinforcements
requested by NATO commanders.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is simply normal military business to decide ... to make the real
provisions so that we take control of the situation there,'' Richard said.
France already has about 4,500 troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen, appearing with Richard, said no decision
had been made on whether more American troops would go. He said that would be
decided after it was clear what NATO commanders needed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We frankly don't anticipate that this is going to be a long-term problem
but rather a flashpoint that has erupted in the last few days or weeks, and
that's the reason we think that a greater show of force and a greater capability
is going to be essential,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   The rising tensions in Mitrovica over the past three weeks prompted the
North Atlantic Council, NATO's governing body, to call a special meeting for
Friday in Brussels to discuss Kosovo, the southern province of Serbia from which
Yugoslav forces were pushed by a NATO bombing campaign last spring.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior U.S. defense official said Army Gen. Wesley Clark and the German
general in charge of the NATO peacekeeping operation in Kosovo had requested
that one French battalion go into Kosovo as reinforcements and that two other
battalions, numbering roughly 1,200 troops, be put on a higher state of
readiness as possible reinforcements. Those other two battalions could include
American or other NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
	   At NATO headquarters, however, an official said Clark was seeking a
reallocation of peacekeepers already in Kosovo, rather than an increase in their
total number.
</P>
<P>
	   Several NATO countries had designated units as a strategic reserve in case a
problem such as the one in Mitrovica arose. The reinforcements include units
from Italy and Poland, plus a U.S. Marine unit.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said reinforcing NATO's peacekeeping operations would complicate
efforts by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to heighten ethnic tensions in
Kosovo between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in defiance of the June agreement to
end NATO's bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Milosevic will take advantage of every opportunity he can'' to undermine
NATO's authority and to foment ethnic unrest, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense secretary said NATO needs to add to its existing force in order
to show Milosevic that he cannot get away with such actions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With this robust reinforcement, we think we will send the right signal''
to both Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, a NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said NATO
intelligence was keeping track of the disposition of the various forces and
cross-border movements, and ensuring that new weapons did not replace the guns
being seized by the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   Intelligence officials believe that Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola
Sainovic, Milosevic's right-hand man for Kosovo affairs who is under indictment
by the U.N. war crimes tribunal for alleged atrocities, is personally running
the stepped-up Yugoslav campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   There are 30,000 NATO troops and 7,000 soldiers from non-NATO countries now
attempting to keep the peace in Kosovo. Others are stationed in neighboring
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
	   The large Serbian population of Mitrovica, located near the border with
Serbia, makes it a flashpoint for violence and a likely place to infiltrate
agents from the north, NATO officials say. American, British and Canadian troops
have been dispatched to the city to help the French, who have been under
increasing pressure.

<HEADLINE> Council Nears Congo Agreement  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- In an unheralded African success story, civil war in
the Republic of Congo has ended, but there isn't enough money to help the
hundreds of thousands of people with great humanitarian needs.
</P>
<P>
	   That was the message delivered Wednesday by Bill Paton, the U.N.
humanitarian coordinator in the country, who said he had never seen access open
up so quickly in an African country -- in this case just weeks after a Dec. 29
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are demobilizing. Offensive action and battles really have ceased,
and perhaps as many as half of the opposition militia members, along with
members of the government militia ... are demobilizing and coming out of the
bush,'' he told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation, he noted, is in stark contrast to the shaky cease-fire and
intermittent fighting across the Congo River in President Laurent Kabila's
Congo.
</P>
<P>
	   Paton said about half the 810,000 people who fled their homes after fighting
broke out in late 1998 have gone back, many to the capital Brazzaville, and
rural areas that were inaccessible for over a year can suddenly be reached.
</P>
<P>
	   The result, he said, is a tremendous strain on very limited resources.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Basic humanitarian needs remain very, very great,'' Paton said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Last year, these 810,000 people were the least assisted displaced people
or refugees in the world because of security and also frankly a degree of lack
of interest,'' he said. ``Most of these people received no assistance
whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations appealed for $7 million in non-food assistance for the
Republic of Congo last year but got just $1.2 million, he said. It received $7
million worth of food and is using some of it to help the refugees now.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, the United Nations is appealing for $19.6 million and will likely
ask for additional money because of the demands of the refugees, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have the opportunity to meet humanitarian needs and support efforts to
build a sustainable peace,'' Paton said. ``My concern is really about speed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The international community needs to help reintegrate demobilized soldiers,
provide basic assistance to rebuild communities in the bush that people are
trying to rejoin, improve justice and plan for elections, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations has been asked to assist with the reintegration of
demobilized militia members and has started a pilot project with 120 men, Paton
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But there are 15,000 demobilized soldiers, and U.N. resources at the moment
consist of a $320,000 grant from Norway which will only pay to find new jobs for
between 500 and 1,000 soldiers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll continue to try to get contributions so we can increase the size of
that group,'' Paton said.

<HEADLINE> A Breeze for Woods at Match Play  </HEADLINE>
    By TIM DAHLBERG AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- If there was one theme players kept repeating
heading into the Match Play Championship, it was that any one of the world's top
64 golfers could beat any other on any given day.
</P>
<P>
	   That might be true, unless one of those golfers is Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
	   While others struggled on a blustery and soggy opening day at La Costa
Resort, Woods promptly won his first three holes Wednesday on his way to a 5 and
4 victory over Michael Campbell.
</P>
<P>
	   In doing so, he showed what others have left unsaid -- that there are really
63 of the world's top golfers at La Costa.
</P>
<P>
	   And then there is Woods.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm playing better, putting better," Woods said. "I knew that if I played
my own game, put pressure on Michael, things should be all right in the end."
</P>
<P>
	   Woods was right, of course, on a day that saw such top 10 notables as Nick
Price, Phil Mickelson and Vijay Singh looking for plane reservations after being
eliminated in their opening matches.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike many in the field, he seems to relish playing match play, a format he
enjoyed great success in while winning three straight U.S. Amateur
championships.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's nice to have that feeling of playing one-on-one," Woods said.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods, scheduled to play Retief Goosen today, birdied the first two holes
and never looked back, closing the match with a par out of the greenside bunker
on No. 14. It was Campbell's 31st birthday, but he was in no mood to celebrate
while facing a 15-hour flight back home to New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, he had to pay tribute to a player he beat going down the stretch in
November to win the Johnnie Walker tournament in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   "Tiger's unique," Campbell said. "I think I was about 50 yards behind him on
most holes. Every time he was over a chip or a putt, you thought he was going to
hole it. That's a scary thought."
</P>
<P>
	   Woods, who made it to the quarterfinals last year before losing to Jeff
Maggert, came into La Costa in a minislump of sorts. His putting was off and so
was his swing in the two tournaments he played after having his string of six
straight tour wins snapped.
</P>
<P>
	   The bad news for the rest of the field, though, is not only that Woods is
playing well again, but that he seems to have regained his fire in a format he
loves.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've had a pretty good record in match play, and this tournament is
something I thoroughly like to play, there's no doubt about it," Woods said.
"Any time we get a chance to play match play, I like it."
</P>
<P>
	   Woods drew most of a crowd thinned out by chilly, blustery conditions that
turned into a downpour for the final groups of the day.
</P>
<P>
	   But he didn't get Amy Mickelson and Tammy Mayfair, good friends who were
following their husbands around the course.
</P>
<P>
	   Unfortunately for the friendship, Mickelson and Mayfair had to play each
other.
</P>
<P>
	   "Phil and Amy are family to Tammy and I," Mayfair said. "We brought the new
year in together. We share houses together. Our nannies room together with the
babies here and everything, and we're very close."
</P>
<P>
	   It turned into a bittersweet win for Mayfair over his pal in a spectacular
ending. With Mickelson looking at a 12-footer for eagle on the second playoff
hole after the two finished 18 holes even, Mayfair blasted from the bunker into
the hole for an eagle.
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson then missed his putt, putting Mayfair into a second round match
against British Open champion Paul Lawrie.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was very difficult to play Phil," Mayfair said. "Obviously, when someone
wins and someone loses, someone is going to be disappointed. I gave Phil and Amy
a hug and vice-versa. And we just go on."
</P>
<P>
	   Not going on were such notables as Price and Greg Norman, as well as last
year's champion, Maggert, who lasted only 13 holes against Bob Tway.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've been struggling a little bit with my game, and today it didn't go too
well for me," Maggert said. "I was four or five over on my own round, and he was
a couple under."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the day's casualties didn't approach last year's first round, when
five of the seven top seeds and 12 of the top 20 were ousted.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year's first-round losers included Davis Love III and Tom Lehman, both
of whom won Wednesday. Love beat Olin Browne 2 and 1, while Lehman continued his
recent streak of good play with a 5 and 4 win over last year's runner-up, Andrew
Magee.

<HEADLINE> America's Cup Race 3 Postponed  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- It's time to break out all the criticisms about
sailing.
</P>
<P>
	Watching it is like watching paint dry ... grass grow ... a car rust.
</P>
<P>
	During the next week at the America's Cup, a few more might pop up. The
forecast for the next seven days -- which includes four scheduled races -- is
for more of the light wind that led officials to postpone Race 3 today between
Italy's Luna Rossa and New Zealand's Black Magic, which leads the best-of-9
series 2-0.
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time in six days that racing was called off because the
summer weather was too nice on the unpredictable Hauraki Gulf. There was more
breeze than there was when Saturday's race was called -- the highest was 8 knots
-- but race officials said it was too unstable, finally calling it nearly 2 1/2
hours after the scheduled start.
</P>
<P>
	After a lay day Friday, the third race is now scheduled for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	Hamish Wilcox, weatherman for Prada Challenge, which is backing Luna Rossa,
said the forecast calls for light air for the next seven days, which includes
four scheduled races.
</P>
<P>
	The sailors agree that it's painful to just circle around waiting for the
breeze to fill in.
</P>
<P>
	``Light days are pretty much like you see it on TV -- it's like watching the
grass grow,'' said Black Magic tactician Brad Butterworth, a key member of the
team that routed Dennis Conner off San Diego in 1995 to bring the America's Cup
to Auckland.
</P>
<P>
	Besides pushing back the schedule, the weather delays are spawning a bit of a
controversy. Experts say Luna Rossa performs well in light conditions and that
Black Magic does better in heavier air.
</P>
<P>
	Race director Harold Bennett said the notion that his decision was influenced
by Team New Zealand is ``incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
	Luna Rossa's sailors wanted to sail. Black Magic's didn't. They both had their
reasons.
</P>
<P>
	``We were a little unhappy that we didn't have a race today,'' Luna Rossa
navigator Matteo Plazzi said. ``We felt the conditions were good enough today,
better than a few of the races of the (challenger series).
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to come back from our bad sailing day, and everyone wanted to go
for a race today.''
</P>
<P>
	He was referring to Tuesday's disastrous second race, when the Italians had
every possible bad break happen, including a bloodied crewman and a keel fouled
by debris.
</P>
<P>
	Butterworth said light, shifty winds can be a problem for both teams.
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a big enough difference (in shifts) and big holes, it can become a
bit of luck, and that can be a big problem.''
</P>
<P>
	Butterworth said complaints of a lopsided playing field aren't new.
</P>
<P>
	``Ever since I've been in this game, it's been the challengers' prerogative to
complain,'' he said. ``I just think it's an inherited thing of challengers to
complain. We complained when we were challengers.''
</P>
<P>
	Butterworth said the Kiwis don't mind sailing in light wind, noting that the
conditions were similar off San Diego.
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said the only part of the course with acceptable wind was in the
starting area. ``Prada proved that to us by sailing up and down in it. Up the
course, there was nothing to convince me to do it and be fair with it.
</P>
<P>
	``Basically it was my call,'' Bennett said. ``I wasn't happy with it.''
</P>
<P>
	Some spectators spent the long delay fishing or swimming.
</P>
<P>
	Massimiliano Sirena was back on Luna Rossa two days after having his head
gashed by the pole the Italians were using to try to clear debris from their
keel on the disastrous first leg of Race 2.
</P>
<P>
	Sirena was taken off the boat to receive stitches, but remained on the water to
watch the rest of the race. He stayed at home Wednesday when Luna Rossa went out
to train on an off day.

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs class-action status in $8 billion suit against Visa  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Visa and MasterCard plan to appeal a judge's decision to
grant class-action status to a lawsuit by the nation's largest retailers and
smaller merchants accusing the companies of antitrust violations costing $8.1
billion.
<P>
	   Brooklyn U.S. District Judge John Gleeson gave the retailers and merchants
the pre-trial legal victory Wednesday, but otherwise made it clear in his
45-page written decision that he was not ruling on the merits of the case.
</P>
<P>
	   He also encouraged the parties to appeal his ruling on class-action status,
saying the issue "raises substantial and novel questions involving the standards
a district court should apply in evaluating a class motion and the interaction
of those standards with antitrust principles."
</P>
<P>
	   Kelly Presta, a Visa spokesman, said the company would appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Presta said class-action status means even those merchants who have
enthusiastically promoted the debit cards would become adversaries of the
company in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   "Including them is illogical," he said. "This is a far reaching class that
isn't really appropriate."
</P>
<P>
	   He predicted Visa would win the case at trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharon Gamsin, a spokeswoman for MasterCard, said the company also planned
to appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   She said rules requiring merchants to accept all MasterCard credit and debit
cards are meant to protect consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   The 3-year-old lawsuit accuses Visa USA Inc. and MasterCard International of
using a monopoly in credit cards since 1992 to force businesses to pay
exorbitant transaction fees to accept debit cards.
</P>
<P>
	   The $8.1 billion damage estimate is the amount businesses contend they were
overcharged by the credit-card companies. If the retailers win, the damage award
could triple under antitrust law to $24.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Gleeson acknowledged that the litigation "poses enormous financial risks for
the defendants, risks that are obviously increased drastically by certification
of the class."
</P>
<P>
	   A trial is set to begin Nov. 27. The class of plaintiffs will now consist of
about 4 million merchants, including Wal-Mart Stores, Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.,
Safeway Stores Inc., Circuit City Stores Inc. and the National Retail
Federation.
</P>
<P>
	   Businesses typically pay fees ranging from 1 percent to 2 percent of the
amount spent by a customer each time a credit or debit card is used. The cards
provide numerous advantages for businesses by making it easier for consumers to
make purchases and decreasing the amount of cash susceptible to theft. It also
guarantees payment to a merchant, whereas a check can bounce.
</P>
<P>
	   Generally, the amount of each credit or debit card transaction is deposited
into the bank account of the business within a day or so.
</P>
<P>
	   But the lawsuit contends that the transaction fee for debit cards should be
much lower because the cards pose a much lower risk for credit card companies
since money is taken directly out of a customer's bank account.
</P>
<P>
	   The merchants say that debit card competitors of Visa and MasterCard charge
as little as a nickel for the same transaction for which Visa and MasterCard
charge more than a dollar.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Ordered Off Field  </HEADLINE>
    By FRED GOODALL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry trotted into a corner beneath the
stands, slipped into the clubhouse and out of Legends Field. If or when he
returns is not up to him or the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
	   Baseball ordered the 37-year-old outfielder to leave spring training because
of a positive cocaine test, and commissioner Bud Selig will decide what happens
next.
</P>
<P>
	   There was a strong sign Wednesday that Strawberry could be suspended for the
season. At his age, some believe that would amount to a lifetime ban.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope it's not the end for him because I don't know what that would
mean,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only thing I'd say to the commissioner is I'm glad I'm not you. I
don't know what the answer is. I don't know if this thing is going to go away.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Yankees were taking batting practice when Strawberry was told to go to
the clubhouse, where general manager Brian Cashman relayed the message that he
was to leave camp until Selig acts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were trying to do it with as little fanfare as possible,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
	   The twice-suspended Strawberry met with Selig in Milwaukee on Tuesday, a day
after revealing details about the drug relapse to Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
	   The commissioner was expected to decide Strawberry's fate today. Asked if a
one-year suspension was likely, a high-ranking baseball official, speaking on
the condition he not be identified, said: ``That's a good guess.''
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry said he showed up for the first full-squad workout of the year
with the two-time defending World Series champions to prove that he's not
``running and hiding.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``You guys know I've always been forward,'' Strawberry said. ``I came here
today because this is where I feel I want to be. I really can't comment on
anything right now.''
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry, who turns 38 next month, tested positive for cocaine Jan. 19, a
violation of probation stemming from a no-contest plea to charges of cocaine
possession and soliciting a prostitute in Tampa last spring.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm going to stand by him. I'm going to try to see that he rights his
life. If it's in baseball, fine. If it's outside baseball, fine,'' Steinbrenner
said. ``It isn't like George has given him enough chances, now dump him. Dump
him ... I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
	   Torre said Strawberry called him shortly before his arrival at Legends Field
and said he wanted to work out with the team. Since the Yankees had not received
any direction on the matter from baseball, the manager said OK.
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry made a brief statement to the media before changing into his
uniform and accepting Torre's offer to address his teammates before the workout.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He didn't want to hide. I think that's the first thing he said to me,''
Torre said. ``Obviously, he wouldn't have been here if that was the case. Right
or wrong, we assumed since we didn't hear anything to the contrary that he was
going to be able to work out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Steinbrenner said he learned of the failed test on Monday, when Strawberry
and his wife, Charisse, came to his office. Without elaborating, the owner said
Strawberry talked about the circumstances surrounding the relapse.
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry's first drug suspension was for 60 days in 1995 after he tested
positive for cocaine. The second, from April 24 to Aug. 4 last season, came
after he was arrested in Tampa for possessing 0.3 grams of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry, the 1983 National League Rookie of the Year, has a .259 career
average with 335 homers and 1,000 RBIs. Last year, he hit .333 with two home
runs in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yankees were counting on him to be their regular designated hitter this
season with the retirement of Chili Davis.
</P>
<P>
	   Strawberry was recovering from colon cancer when he was arrested last April
a few miles from the Yankees' minor league complex, where the club left him to
work when spring training ended.
</P>
<P>
	   He was sentenced to 18 months' probation and 100 hours of community service.
Among the factors Strawberry cited for that relapse were chemotherapy, which he
claimed led to depression, and the Yankees' decision to open the season without
him.

<HEADLINE> Nomar Has Big Numbers, Except Salary  </HEADLINE>
    By HOWARD ULMAN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Nomar Garciaparra has piled up some impressive
numbers in his three full major league seasons -- 92 homers and a .326 batting
average.
</P>
<P>
	   His salary figures, however, are nothing special. Despite being rookie of
the year, runnerup in the MVP voting and batting champion in the American League
during his career, he was paid less last season than 17 other starting
shortstops.
</P>
<P>
	   He claims that doesn't bother him. The jackpot he wants to hit is a World
Series championship with the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't really look at individual stuff,'' Garciaparra said. ``Hopefully,
I've gotten better to help the team get better and get to our ultimate goal.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Red Sox have gotten closer in each of his three seasons -- missing the
playoffs in his first year, reaching the first round the next year and advancing
to the second round last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Had they beaten the New York Yankees in the AL championship series in 1999,
the Red Sox would have reached the World Series for the first time since 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We didn't lose to a better team. We just didn't play well enough to win at
the time,'' Garciaparra said. ``My goal's the same every year. I try to win the
World Series.''
</P>
<P>
	   Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter has three World Series rings and makes a lot
more money than Garciaparra. Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez also draws a
bigger salary and could become baseball's highest-paid player after this season.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he gets what he gets, I'm happy for him,'' Garciaparra said of Jeter.
``I'm perfectly content with what I got. It was a great thing to do at the time,
and if I look back, I still would have done it the same way. I was able to do
some stuff, take care of some personal things, knowing that the security was
there.''
</P>
<P>
	   Garciaparra is earning $3.3 million in the third year of a five-year
contract worth $23.25 million
</P>
<P>
	   Jeter has a $10 million, one-year deal and is negotiating a record $118.5
million, seven-year contract. Rodriguez is making $4.25 million in the final
year of his contract and could get $200 million over 10 years as a free agent
next fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Garciaparra's .322 career batting average is higher than both of theirs, but
he said he hasn't considered asking to renegotiate his deal after Jeter signs a
long-term contract.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That doesn't even cross my mind,'' said Garciaparra, who went through his
first full-squad workout Wednesday. ``I don't even know what he's making.''
</P>
<P>
	   Garciaparra's contract has salaries of $6.85 million in 2001 and $8.6
million in 2002, then gives the Red Sox option to keep him at $10.5 million in
2003 and $11.5 million in 2004, with a $1 million buyout in the unlikely event
they let him go.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, Garciaparra hit .306 and led the AL with 209 hits and 11 triples.
The next year he hit .323 and was runnerup for the MVP award. Last year, he led
the AL with a .357 average.
</P>
<P>
	   Third baseman John Valentin said he hasn't seen much change in Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think he's buying a little bit more dinners now, but he's really the
same Nomar. He's down to earth, a fan favorite, and well deserved,'' Valentin
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Garciaparra went through the playoffs with a wrist bruised when it was hit
by a pitch from Baltimore's Al Reyes on Sept. 25. He played nine of the 10
playoff games, sitting out only Game 3 in the AL division series against
Cleveland with Boston trailing 2-0.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That was the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But he's healthy now and ready to continue his role as the offensive leader
-- if not the financial leader -- on the Red Sox, who had 17 players making more
than him last season.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm totally content with what I got,'' Garciaparra said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the Japanese yen Thursday on
optimism over strength in the American economy. Tokyo share prices also rose.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 111.00 yen, up 0.42 yen from its level of 110.58 yen late
Wednesday in Tokyo but slightly below its late New York level of 111.30 yen
overnight.

points, or 0.67 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar largely followed through from its overnight
strength in New York. There, the greenback gained after U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony Wednesday before a Senate panel.

said he expects the U.S. economy to remain strong.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 111.24 yen, up from 111.10 yen
late Wednesday in Tokyo.

	   On the stock market, prices moved higher following an overnight rally by
technology and Internet stocks in New York.
</P>

<HEADLINE> D-Backs: AL Move May Be Inevitable  </HEADLINE>
    By BOB BAUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- There is a growing feeling among the Arizona
Diamondbacks that a move to the American League next season might be inevitable.
</P>
<P>
	   The defending NL West champions will have to be dragged kicking and
screaming to the other league, but they know they have no choice if that's what
the other owners decide to do.
</P>
<P>
	   When Arizona was added to the NL and Tampa Bay joined the American League as
expansion teams for the 1998 season, baseball included clauses that allows the
teams to be moved to other leagues and divisions after 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a last-minute addition and I didn't like it, but we had no
choice,'' Diamondbacks owner Jerry Colangelo said as he watched the team's first
full-squad workout Wednesday. ``I wasn't happy at the time and I'm not any
happier today.''
</P>
<P>
	   Commissioner Bud Selig wants some realignment for 2001, with the emphasis on
getting Texas out of the AL West, where the Rangers have to deal with a two-hour
time zone difference with the other clubs in the division: Seattle, Oakland and
California.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan mentioned most often by owners has Arizona moving to the AL West,
Texas to the AL Central, Detroit to the AL East and Tampa Bay to the NL East.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The announcement that Bud wants to have some partial realignment in 2001,
having heard that, I look at the facts,'' Colangelo said. ``Baseball has the
right to move two franchises. Hmmm? We're off to a bad start here.''
</P>
<P>
	   Owners are likely to meet in April, and realignment could be taken up then.
A draft of the 2001 schedule must be given to the players association by July 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Last fall, Colangelo gave Selig results of a survey that showed 85 percent
of Arizona fans want the team to stay in the National League. Besides, Colangelo
has argued from the start that Phoenix fits better in the NL.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Geographically, it was a perfect fit,'' he said. ``It was a tight fit.
Look at the proximity between San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Denver and
Phoenix. It was perfect.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The history was that Phoenix was a National League city. The Giants'
Triple-A team was there forever. Dodgers games used to be broadcast into
Arizona. Look at the relationship between San Diego and Phoenix, with people
traveling back and forth. It's perfect. And Denver and Phoenix have a lot of
similarities in terms of size, growth and so forth.''
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona will find few allies among other teams in the NL West who resent the
team's sudden rise.
</P>
<P>
	   `I'd say our success, as quickly as we've had it, may have some impact on
opinions,'' Colangelo said. ``Enough said.''
</P>
<P>
	   Colangelo hopes Selig will put off a decision until it's determined whether
some of the weaker franchises may move. He said such a move could hurt the
Diamondbacks financially.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It seems to me you wait until the smoke settles, you look at the total
picture of realignment, then everyone has to be open-minded,'' he said. ``No one
is forced to do something they'd rather not.''
</P>
<P>
	   Manager Buck Showalter, who has considerable AL experience as manager of the
New York Yankees, said the Diamondbacks were developed as a National League
franchise, with all the draft picks chosen for the NL style of play.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm preparing a club to play in the National League this year,'' Showalter
said. ``If and when someone tells me that we have to prepare a club to play in
the American League, there are a number of things that we'll have to approach
differently.''
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona's Todd Stottlemyre pitched most of his career in the American League
with Toronto, Oakland and Texas and would just as soon not go back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I love the National League. I love the National League style of play. I
don't dislike the American League because it's baseball. It's a great game over
there, too. But there are recognizable differences. There's a lot more strategy
over here. ... I like the speed of the game. I like the whole thought process of
the game. It's so much different than over there.''
</P>
<P>
	   Brian Anderson, who pitched for Cleveland in the AL, wants nothing to do
with a move back to that league.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I like National League baseball,'' he said. ``I like pitchers being
involved. It's a much better brand of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wherever they are, the Diamondbacks will be tough to beat, general manager
Joe Garagiola Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have taken some care to talk to our fans and see what they think, and
they don't think much of the idea,'' Garagiola said. ``But if it happens, it
happens. Our job is to go out and be competitive, and we will be.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a public show of division in the Clinton
administration, the Agriculture Department is raising concerns about a plan to
reduce pollution from farms and logging operations.
</P>
<P>
	   The Environmental Protection Agency needs to clarify the rules it is
proposing and determine how much they will cost landowners, Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman told the Senate Agriculture Committee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Farmers demand clarity. ... What they don't need is more uncertainty,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   EPA in August proposed to require states to submit plans within 15 years to
clean up every waterway that fails to meet water quality standards. The agency
estimates that there more than 20,000 streams and lakes that don't meet
water-quality standards, including long sections of the Mississippi and Colorado
rivers.
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman disavowed a letter that a senior USDA official sent to EPA last
fall questioning the agency's legal authority to regulate farm runoff and other
indirect sources of water pollution. EPA has until now concentrated on
regulating direct sources, such as pollution from factories and sewage plants.
</P>
<P>
	   But Glickman said he still had concerns about the plan, including the lack
of a comprehensive cost estimate. The rules are ``very complex and would present
a challenge to any expert on the issue,'' Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
	   They also should make it clear that regulators will take into account steps
farmers have taken to limit runoff, such as planting trees along a stream.
</P>
<P>
	   EPA Administrator Carol Browner, who appeared before the committee alongside
Glickman, emphasized that it would be up to each state to decide how to meet the
reductions in pollutants required by their plans. She said the agency's proposal
was a ``very, very sensible way to do the final work to ensure clean water for
everyone in this country.''
</P>
<P>
	   States have primary responsibility for identifying streams that fall short
of water quality standards and making plans to clean them up under the 1972
Clean Water Act. From 1972 to 1998, states only approved 1,000 of the 40,000
runoff-control plans that are needed, according to EPA.
</P>
<P>
	   Landowners would be required to get a pollution discharge permit only if the
agency found they were contributing to nearby water quality problems, and only
if a state had failed to draft an adequate plan for improving water quality, the
agency says.
</P>
<P>
	   Some congressional Democrats also have expressed concern about EPA's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Blanche Lambert Lincoln, D-Ark., introduced legislation earlier this
month that would prohibit EPA from regulating runoff from private logging
operations. She said it should be left up to states to decide whether to
regulate such pollution.
</P>
<P>
	   The EPA plan would ``get us nowhere closer to a cleaner environment than we
would get from a voluntary program,'' Lincoln said.

<HEADLINE> States Have $7B of Unspent Welfare  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A coalition of anti-poverty groups said states are
hoarding $7 billion in unspent federal funds earmarked to help poor Americans
and called on governors to see to it that the money is used to assist low-income
families.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventeen states each have accumulated more than $100 million in unspent
federal funds from 1997 to 1999. Other states have tens of millions of dollars
they haven't spent, a study by the National Campaign for Jobs and Income showed.
</P>
<P>
	   California had the most, with $1.6 billion. New York had the second highest
amount -- $1.1 billion -- and Ohio was third, with nearly $734 million.
Forty-five states and the District of Columbia had surpluses, the report showed.
</P>
<P>
	   The group's study, released today ahead of a weekend meeting of the National
Governors Association, added up state funds that had not yet been committed to
anti-poverty programs and funds that were earmarked for programs but not yet
spent.
</P>
<P>
	   State welfare officials disputed the $7 billion figure and said the actual
amount of money not yet committed to poverty programs -- $2.5 billion out of $48
billion total -- shows that states are spending most of their funds and putting
a little aside in case welfare rolls rise.
</P>
<P>
	   The surplus funds are a result of a dramatic decrease in the number of
Americans on welfare, a phenomenon caused by a robust economy and strict new
federal rules. Though welfare rolls are down, federal block grants for states'
anti-poverty programs have remained constant at $16 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the 1996 law that overhauled the federal welfare system, states have
wide discretion to design their own anti-poverty programs and use the money for
cash assistance programs and to help people who moved from welfare to work.
</P>
<P>
	   There are no deadlines for spending the money or rules about giving back
unspent funds, although some members of Congress introduced a give-back bill
last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the National Campaign for Jobs and Income, a coalition of 60
state and local anti-poverty groups, accused states of stockpiling their federal
money amid persistent poverty. They blamed too-strict eligibility requirements
that keep some people from qualifying for programs and say states are not doing
enough to get funds to needy families.
</P>
<P>
	   They also complained that a handful of states were diverting the money to
pay for tax cuts or other state programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a disgrace that these funds are sitting idle or being ill-spent at a
time when millions of families aren't sharing in our nation's prosperity,'' said
Peter Edelman, a Georgetown University law professor who left the Clinton
administration to protest the 1996 welfare law.
</P>
<P>
	   William Waldman, executive director of the American Public Human Services
Association, said the surpluses exist because states were cautious about
spending the grants and wanted to keep some money aside in case the economy
turns sour and welfare cases rise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not bad public policy to keep a little back for a rainy day,''
Waldman said.
</P>
<P>
	   At least six states -- Connecticut, Kansas, Minnesota, New York, Texas and
Wisconsin -- have used their unspent funds to pay for tax cuts and other state
programs, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, Wisconsin used federal funds in place of state funds for its
earned income tax credit program. Kansas used federal welfare funds for its
child welfare system.
</P>
<P>
	   The practice, which is not believed to be widespread, is allowed as long as
the money is used to help low-income families, said Michael Kharfen, spokesman
at the Department of Health and Human Services, which administers the block
grant program to states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They can't use the funds for repairing roads or building schools or
general budget needs,'' said Kharfen.
</P>
<P>
	   Edelman said the practice is troubling because it takes funds away from
welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's plenty of important useful things to spend the money on,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Threaten Protests in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbs in this ethnically divided city
are threatening protests and more unrest in response to plans by NATO-led
peacekeepers to begin resettling ethnic Albanians on the Serb-controlled north
bank of the Ibar River.
</P>
<P>
	   The plans announced Wednesday by the peacekeeping command involve moving
ethnic Albanians back to homes in three high-rise apartment buildings. U.N.
officials said ethnic Albanians would begin registering Friday and relocations
would begin next week.
</P>
<P>
	   With so many Serbs and ethnic Albanians living in the same community,
Kosovska Mitrovica is the most ethnically mixed city in Kosovo -- and the most
violence-prone.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, U.S. and French officials announced Wednesday that France is
sending 600 to 700 more troops and the United States may send in a Marine unit
to help quell the rising violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is simply normal military business to decide ... to make the real
provisions so that we take control of the situation there,'' French Defense
Minister Alain Richard said at a news conference with William Cohen, the U.S.
defense secretary. France already has about 4,500 troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said no decision has been made on whether more American troops would
go. But a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
Marine Expeditionary Unit was on standby for possible movement into the French
sector of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to resettling ethnic Albanians, NATO plans to build a footbridge
across the river in front of the three apartment houses where many of the
Albanians hope to return. Demonstrations would be banned in a wide area
encompassing both Serb and Albanian-dominated neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposals have outraged Serb leaders, who have called for a protest
Friday on the north side of the bridge despite the ban. Serb community leader
Oliver Ivanovic has warned that the crisis would ``peak within 10 to 15 days''
unless the NATO-led Kosovo Force abandons its plans.
</P>
<P>
	   The ethnic Albanian leader of the city, Bajram Rexhepi, called on his fellow
Albanians to avoid demonstrations on the south bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Serb leaders say they were not consulted about the decision. One leader,
Nikola Kabasic, claimed Albanian snipers had fired on French peacekeepers last
weekend from buildings to which ethnic Albanians will be returned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Serbs were excluded this time, although we believe we could have given
some suggestions for calming down the situation,'' Kabasic said. Ivanovic
accused the ethnic Albanians of ``building up tensions to the maximum so they
would use the situation to provoke bloodshed in the northern part of the city.''
</P>
<P>
	   A sweep by U.S. paratroopers in the north also upset the Serbs, who claimed
their homes were ransacked.
</P>
<P>
	   As French troops surrounded the search area, 300 troops of the U.S. 504th
Airborne Infantry -- backed by armored vehicles and in full battle gear --
crossed the Ibar River at dawn and swept through ``Little Bosnia,'' an
ethnically mixed neighborhood, searching house-to-house for weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   A NATO spokesman, Flight Lt. Neville Clayton, said the Americans seized a
rocket-propelled grenade launcher, rifles, grenades and ammunition. Maj. Erik
Gunhus said eight people were taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the raid, the Americans left the city and returned to their base
at Camp Bondsteel in southeastern Kosovo. The U.S. soldiers were among troops
from more than a dozen countries sent to reinforce the French last weekend, when
tensions escalated.
</P>
<P>
	   French troops continued the search after the Americans left.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of ethnic Albanians were killed by Serb forces during President
Slobodan Milosevic's 18-month crackdown against separatists in Kosovo. After
NATO bombing forced the Serb troops to withdraw last spring, ethnic Albanians
began attacking Serbs in revenge.
</P>
<P>
	   Tensions have been rising in Kosovska Mitrovica, which has the largest
remaining Serb enclave in Kosovo, since a grenade attack on a U.N. bus Feb. 2
killed two elderly Serbs south of the city. That triggered revenge attacks that
have left nine people dead and scores injured.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke accused Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic of directing a campaign to undermine the United Nations and
NATO by orchestrating the partition of Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior Yugoslav commander, Gen. Vladimir Lazarevic, has called the
allegation ``nonsense'' aimed at diverting attention from NATO's failure to
bring peace to the province.
</P>
<P>
	   Yugoslav Information Minister Goran Matic has said the Western goal was to
``chase the remaining non-Albanian population from Mitrovica so they could take
the control'' of the rich mining complex outside the city.

<HEADLINE> Primary Attacks Form Rich Harvest  </HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN WOODWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The talk of bigotry, desperation and lack of principle
swirling around the presidential candidates these days is all geared to seizing
the moment. But it will have a shelf life lasting into the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Come summer and the national conventions, each party will unite around the
proposition that its nominee is a swell fellow after all. Come the fall
campaign, strategists will stand ready to remind voters of all the nasty things
said when Democrats and Republicans went after their own.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps not since George Bush slammed Ronald Reagan's ``voodoo economics''
in the 1980 campaign and Democrats didn't let anyone forget it have the
opportunities been so rich to exploit intraparty warfare.
</P>
<P>
	   Essentially, said Paul Begala, a mastermind of Bill Clinton's campaign in
1992, ``My friends in the Democratic Party don't need to make any negative ads
in the fall. All they need to do is to run a VCR on today's news coverage.''
</P>
<P>
	   That coverage shows Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain trading biting
charges about religion-tinged tactics used by the other man's supporters. It
also shows an angry Bill Bradley painting Democratic rival Al Gore as a man
without convictions who has trouble telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The campaigns are a lot more bitter and personal than party loyalists
would want,'' said Begala, now a pundit. ``It is going to hurt both sides.''
</P>
<P>
	   GOP consultant Scott Reed, who managed Republican Bob Dole's 1996
presidential campaign, said Bradley's theme of attacking Gore's veracity will
echo in the fall if the vice president wins the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's helpful that he's warming it up, but Republicans were going to use it
anyway,'' he said. ``It's right out of the RNC (Republican National Committee)
playbook.''
</P>
<P>
	   On the GOP side, the McCain campaign phoned Roman Catholic voters in
Michigan to ensure they knew Bush spoke at a South Carolina school viewed as
anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
	   To help Bush, apparently on his own, a message recorded by Christian
Coalition founder Pat Robertson describing a McCain co-chairman as a ``vicious
bigot'' who is against Christian conservatives also was telephoned to potential
voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Begala can see it now: if Bush wins the nomination, a Democratic ad or
brochure featuring sharp criticisms leveled by McCain; if McCain wins, a similar
encapsulation of what Bush once said about his GOP rival.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're going to star in the negative Democratic ads in the fall,'' Begala
predicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Charlie Black, a top Republican strategist backing Bush, said GOP ads might
show more finesse than simply splashing Bradley's words on the screen, if Gore
wins the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   But one way or another, he suggested, Republicans will attempt to reinforce
vulnerabilities that Bradley is helping to expose in Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We might use Bradley,'' he said. ``But if I had to spend the rest of the
afternoon mapping out the campaign, there is plenty of Gore footage to use.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We might do better to put Gore on TV talking about 'no controlling legal
authority,''' he said, referring to the vice president's clumsy defense of 1996
fund-raising practices.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley accused Gore on Wednesday of showing ``followership,'' not
leadership. He speaks derisively of the ``Gore dance,'' and a new campaign ad
asks: ``When it comes right down to it, what does Al Gore really stand for?''
Gore says his opponent is desperate.
</P>
<P>
	   Because Clinton was unopposed in 1996, Republicans had few
Democrat-to-Democrat attacks to throw in his face.
</P>
<P>
	   And in 1992, the Democratic primary fight won by Clinton was courteous by
the standards of this race, Begala said.
</P>
<P>
	   When Gennifer Flowers made her explosive allegations during the 1992 New
Hampshire campaign that she'd been Clinton's lover, his Democratic opponents
tiptoed.
</P>
<P>
	   This time, transcendent character flaws of a different sort are being openly
alleged by candidates and quickly earmarked by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's visit to Bob Jones University, which also forbids interracial dating
among students, won't be forgotten. And Republican researchers are fattening
their Gore files by the hour.
</P>
<P>
	   All for the autumn day when the candidates who lose in the spring rise again
in unintended service to the other side.

<HEADLINE> Bradley: workers, women and children should benefit more from boom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - America should take the lead in opening markets around
the world, says Bill Bradley. But the Democratic presidential candidate wants
the government to pay the price for any American jobs lost in the process.
<P>
	   Speaking to students at Columbia University on Wednesday, he proposed that
workers who lose jobs as a result of foreign trade agreements be offered
financial help.
</P>
<P>
	   "Despite our success, far too many Americans are on the outside looking in,"
said the former senator from New Jersey, who is battling Vice President Al Gore
for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said America cannot sustain its booming economy unless it fortifies
a basic pillar of its success: working families.
</P>
<P>
	   The so-called Earnings Insurance Program linked to trade agreements would
reimburse half a worker's lost wages for three years, up to a maximum of $10,000
per year. Bradley estimates the program would cost no more than $200 million a
year, once an agreement takes effect.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking under a mammoth American flag, he faced a friendly audience of
mostly students who greeted him with warm applause and a standing ovation. Then
he laid out his economic vision.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time in a half century, he said, the country's economy has
broken free of the post-Depression and World War II economic legacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley accused Gore of offering an economic policy that would harm the
country rather than prolong its prosperity. He said the vice president would
pursue national debt reduction even if the economy were slow, the kind of
management Bradley believes once contributed to the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
	   However, he praised America's "spectacular" economic performance under the
Clinton administration and said the pro-growth policies should remain in place.
</P>
<P>
	   "But the base of economic revival must be broadened. Prosperity is
inclusive, not exclusive," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   He cited such statistics as the 13.5 million children living in poverty, the
44 million citizens without health insurance and the income gap between men and
women.
</P>
<P>
	   "Workers and families are at the top of my economic agenda," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   And, the candidate said, attention must be paid to future workers.
</P>
<P>
	   For them, Bradley proposed a $100 million pilot program to teach children
below the poverty level how to use computers in this information-driven age.
Each family would get a $400 "Infostamp," and the computer industry would be
challenged to create a package of hardware, software and Internet access for
that price.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will not have true prosperity until all our citizens share in the
prosperity of our economic growth," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   To finance the new economic agenda, he said, the nation now has a powerful
tool - fiscal surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   His speech, sponsored by the Columbia University Economic Society, marked
Bradley's third straight day on the New York campaign trail as the March 7
"Super Tuesday" primaries - including the New York vote - draw near.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday night, the former New York Knicks star debated Gore at the Apollo
Theatre; on Tuesday he campaigned on Long Island. The New York primary is
considered key to his presidential bid.

<HEADLINE> Bradley: Gore Stole My Ideas  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The campaign trail can be a lonely place, but Bill
Bradley wishes it was even lonelier. Every time he proposes an idea, he
complains, Al Gore suggests the same thing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sometimes I think I should be humming 'Me and My Shadow,''' Bradley said
recently.
</P>
<P>
	   It happened again Wednesday, when the vice president proposed a Medicare
coverage plan resembling what Bradley put on the table last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is yet another example of the 'co-opt Kid' at work,'' Bradley
groused.
</P>
<P>
	   It has become a common refrain from the underdog's camp: Bradley says he
breaks new ground on an issue, only to find Gore close behind.
</P>
<P>
	   During a debate Monday in New York, Bradley criticized Gore for capping the
prescription drug benefit in his health care plan. Gore revised his proposal
Wednesday to lift the cap.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley strategist Anita Dunn said Gore again ``acknowledged that he dares
to follow where Bill Bradley has boldly led.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also has aped Bradley's schedule by rushing out announcements on the
eve of Bradley's own long-planned pronouncements on the same subjects.
</P>
<P>
	   By drawing attention now to the trend, Bradley hopes to underscore his
latest line of attack, which is that Gore has no core beliefs of his own. ``He
claims these issues are priorities for him, but priorities come from
convictions, not through polls,'' Bradley told New Yorkers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore aides said the revised prescription plan was based on recent
projections of bigger budget surpluses. A spokesman said the vice president has
no shortage of original proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's typical of Bradley to try to take credit for every idea under the
sun,'' said Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway. ``But the fact is, these are big
issues that a lot of candidates are talking about. I don't think voters are
keeping a scorecard on who is proposing them first.''
</P>
<P>
	   Though concerned that ``co-opt kid'' might sound like the lament of a
challenger trailing badly in the polls, Bradley partisans say the evidence of
the pattern is -- as one put it -- ``uncanny.''
</P>
<P>
	   -- Earlier this month, Bradley criticized President Clinton for nominating
Bradley Smith, a Republican who opposes overhauling the campaign finance system,
to the board of the Federal Election Commission, and questioned why Gore had not
protested Clinton's decision. Gore criticized the nomination four days later,
saying he was unaware of it.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Last April, Bradley condemned the flying of the Confederate flag over the
South Carolina Statehouse. As recently as Jan. 7, a Gore spokeswoman said he
``supports the right of the people of South Carolina'' to remove it. In
mid-January, Gore said the flag should be removed from public buildings because
it divides Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   -- In a September interview with The Advocate, Bradley called for abolishing
the Clinton administration's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy on gays in the
military. Gore earlier had said he would implement the policy ``with more
compassion.'' In December, he said he would end it, too.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Bradley also told The Advocate he opposes as ``divisive'' an
anti-gay-marriage ballot initiative in California. Gore previously had said he
would ``have to educate myself'' about it. But hours after Bradley's interview
was released, Gore's campaign said Gore opposed it, too. ``Consider him
educated,'' a spokeswoman said then.
</P>
<P>
	   -- In June, Bradley unveiled a gun-control agenda that included a proposed
ban on cheap ``Saturday night specials'' and a mandatory photo ID card for
handgun owners. In July, Gore unveiled a gun-control plan that included photo
gun licenses and a ban on Saturday night specials.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore aides said the plan includes elements not in Bradley's -- such as
stricter penalties for dealers who sell guns illegally -- and is part of a
larger crime-fighting plan unmatched by Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore aides also say Bradley takes credit for thinking up initiatives already
offered by the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is hardly the first politician to claim theft of ideas.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans for years have complained that Clinton has co-opted their
issues, taking credit for welfare reform and balanced budgets that the GOP had
championed for years.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Bob Dole tried pressing the case in his unsuccessful 1996
campaign against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   As Dole put it then, ``If everything he's for we're already for, why
shouldn't we be there instead of him?''

<HEADLINE> 3 Sentenced in Japan Blood Scandal  </HEADLINE>
   By KOZO MIZOGUCHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- Three former drug company executives accused of selling blood
products tainted with the virus that causes AIDS in the 1980s were convicted
today and given brief prison terms.
</P>
<P>
	   The convictions were the first in a wide-ranging tainted blood scandal that
shook Japan's powerful bureaucracy and pharmaceutical industry. About 1,800
hemophiliacs were infected, and an estimated 500 have died.
</P>
<P>
	   The three were top executives of the company at the center of the scandal,
Green Cross Corp. They were tried over the AIDS-related death of a liver
patient.
</P>
<P>
	   Renzo Matsushita, 79, Tadakazu Suyama, 72, and Takehiko Kawano, 69, were
accused of permitting the sale of unheated blood-clotting agents known to carry
the risk of infection with HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   All three pleaded guilty in 1997. Matsushita -- a former Health and Welfare
Ministry official -- was given a 2-year prison term, Suyama received 18 months
and Kawano 16 months, said Osaka District Court spokesman Mikinori Kobayashi.
</P>
<P>
	   Some critics were disappointed at the short prison terms.

	   Ryuhei Kawada, a hemophiliac infected with HIV from tainted blood products
and one of plaintiffs in a civil suit against Green Cross, said the punishment
was insufficient. ``I cannot but feel anger,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   The scandal triggered public outrage against the drug industry and
government officials charged with regulating it, and resulted in the prosecution
of a former bureaucrat and an adviser to the government on AIDS policy. No
decisions have been reached in those cases.
</P>
<P>
	   The scandal centered on the company's failure to heat-treat imported blood
products despite the widespread knowledge at the time that untreated blood could
transmit HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   By 1985, the government already had approved safe, heat-treated coagulants,
but Green Cross continued to sell its supplies because it faced losing money by
dumping its inventory of untreated products.
</P>
<P>
	   The three defendants approved the sales of unsterilized blood products in
March 1985 and did not recall the products even after the company began selling
heated agents in January 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time of the sales in question, Matsushita was president of the
company, Suyama was vice president and Kawano was chief of the company's drug
production.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We take the ruling seriously and we will do our utmost not to cause damage
by drug products again,'' Kyodo News agency quoted the company as saying in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Green Cross has paid a total of about $216 million in compensation to
victims and bereaved families after legal battles and subsequent court-mediated
settlements.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   Just three games into his stint with the Philadelphia 76ers, Toni Kukoc has
already reached a career high.
</P>
<P>
	   Kukoc grabbed 14 rebounds, more than he ever grabbed playing alongside on
the Chicago Bulls, as the 76ers defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 94-78
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's still too early to compare roles, but I'm glad guys are looking for
me," said Kukoc, whose 18 points were his most since joining Philadelphia in a
three-team trade last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The 76ers opened a double-digit lead in the first quarter and held it most
of the way, although the Clippers closed to 68-60 with 31 seconds left in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   A jumper by Kukoc restored the double-digit lead, and Philadelphia then
pulled away by scoring the first eight points of the fourth quarter. Allen
Iverson capped the run with a steal and dunk.
</P>
<P>
	   In other NBA games, the Los Angeles Lakers defeated Cleveland 116-98,
Toronto beat New York 99-88, Golden State downed Milwaukee 91-86, Miami beat New
Jersey 99-85, Indiana topped Detroit 118-111 and Atlanta defeated Sacramento
100-94.
</P>
<P>
	   Iverson scored 22 points and Tyrone Hill had 15 for the 76ers, who bounced
back from a loss Sunday night to the Lakers. In that game, Iverson had his
next-to-last shot rejected by Kobe Bryant instead of passing to Kukoc, who was
wide open in the corner.
</P>
<P>
	   In this game, Kukoc took another step toward getting acquainted with his new
teammates.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a highly gifted player," coach Larry Brown said. "I hope he's getting
more comfortable."
</P>
<P>
	   Lamar Odom had 20 points and nine rebounds for the Clippers. Derek Anderson
had 19 points and Maurice Taylor 18 for Los Angeles, which has lost 26 of 29
games.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant scored 21 points and Robert Horry 20 as the Lakers completed a sweep
of their six-game Eastern Conference road trip and won their ninth straight
overall.
</P>
<P>
	   Los Angeles is now tied for the best record in the NBA with Portland at
43-11.
</P>
<P>
	   Cleveland's Shawn Kemp finished the night by tearing off his jersey and
tossing it into the stands. He was ejected late in the fourth quarter for
throwing towels on the court after he fouled out.
</P>
<P>
	   Kemp, who scored 23 points, showered quickly and left Gund Arena without
speaking to reporters. He has been the subject of numerous rumors approaching
today's 3 p.m. EST trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cavaliers came back from a 13-point first-half deficit to take a couple
of brief leads in the third quarter. But Bryant's 3-pointer with 1:30 left in
the quarter put Los Angeles up for good at 79-76, and the Lakers pulled away as
Shaquille O'Neal scored 11 of his 19 points in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Vince Carter had 33 points, nine rebounds and nine assists as Toronto
snapped a three-game losing streak and ruined Patrick Ewing's move into 15th
place on the NBA's career scoring list.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter scored 15 points in the third quarter and Toronto's final seven of
the game to give the Raptors their second victory over the Knicks in nine days.
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Christie added 22 points and Tracy McGrady had 16 for the Raptors, who
ended New York's five-game home winning streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Donyell Marshall had a career-high 37 points and a season-high 21 rebounds
as Golden State, playing without its top three scorers, won at Milwaukee
</P>
<P>
	   Erick Dampier added 12 points and 10 rebounds for the Warriors, who
improbably won for the third time in four games despite playing without injured
Antawn Jamison, Chris Mills and Larry Hughes, a last-minute scratch because of a
sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
	   Marshall's dominant performance, which included 21 second-half points and
eight offensive rebounds, gave Milwaukee a six-game homecourt losing streak. The
Bucks have lost seven of eight games overall.
</P>
<P>
	   Alonzo Mourning came back from a broken nose and hit his first 13 shots,
scoring a season-high 43 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Mourning, injured Monday when he was struck by Michael Curry's elbow in a
loss at Detroit, finished 13-of-14 from the field and made 17 of 24 free throws.
He added 16 rebounds in 33 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Heat, coming off a 1-3 road trip, won their seventh straight home game.
Miami earned its first victory over the Nets in three games this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Rik Smits returned to the Indiana lineup with a season-high 29 points as the
Pacers won at Detroit.
</P>
<P>
	   Indiana got Smits back after he missed three games with a sore back. Reggie
Miller and Jalen Rose each scored 23 points and Austin Croshere had 18 as the
Pacers won for the sixth time in seven games. Mark Jackson had six points and 14
assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Grant Hill led Detroit with 24 points and Lindsey Hunter had 20, but the
Pistons lost for the fourth time in five games.
</P>
<P>
	   Isaiah Rider scored 33 points in Atlanta's win at Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hawks won for the fourth straight time at Arco Arena, and they are 11-1
against the Kings in the past seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Jackson had 17 points, 12 rebounds and six assists for the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Webber had 28 points and 20 rebounds for the Kings, who have lost
three straight and six of seven.

<HEADLINE> Spurs' Elliott Closer to Return  </HEADLINE>
    By KELLEY SHANNON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Sean Elliott, bidding to make an unprecedented comeback
after a kidney transplant, hopes to be playing for the San Antonio Spurs in the
next three weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott said Wednesday he needs more weeks like this one, with back-to-back
practices, as he returns to game shape.
</P>
<P>
	   "Tuesday's practice was a monster," said Elliott, who went through grueling
drills that day with the reserves. Elliott practiced again Wednesday with the
full team before the Spurs left for a three-game road trip to Charlotte, Chicago
and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
	   No exact timetable for his return has been set by the 32-year-old forward or
coach Gregg Popovich. Popovich wouldn't say Wednesday what kind of progress
Elliott is making or when he might return.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't on a day-to-day basis say he improved X percent," Popovich said.
"We're going to wait until the beginning of March, evaluate him again, and then
we'll give everybody an idea of where he's at."
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott said he doesn't care which game marks his return and joked that
cheering from the fans won't be the only thing motivating him when he makes his
comeback.
</P>
<P>
	   "What motivates me is I don't want to embarrass myself when I run out onto
the floor," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott resumed full practices with the team in early February.
</P>
<P>
	   He had to sign a waiver releasing the Spurs from liability should he be
injured during his comeback. He is making $6.2 million this season and is to
make $5 million next season, the last year of his contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott received a kidney from his brother, Noel, on Aug. 16. Elliott had
focal segmental glomerular sclerosis, which prevents the kidneys from properly
filtering waste from the blood. Without the transplant, he soon would have been
forced to undergo kidney dialysis.
</P>
<P>
	   If he resumes his NBA career, he would be the first pro athlete to return a
sport after a kidney transplant.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott made some key plays last year in helping San Antonio win its first
NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly falling out of bounds, he hit a game-winning 3-point shot during the
Western Conference finals against Portland. Elliott averaged 11.9 points in the
playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Teen-ager convicted of murdering stepfather  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WATURBURY, Conn. (AP) - An 18-year-old Watertown man has been convicted
of murder in the stabbing of his stepfather, a killing he claimed came in self
defense as he tried to protect himself from being beaten.
<P>
	   Patrick Collins, who was 16 at the time of the stabbing, faces up to 60
years in prison when he is sentenced on April 28.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Maureen Keegan had argued that Collins easily could have fled
from the January 1998 fight with James DiVirgilio, 41, instead of stabbing him
to death with an 8-inch kitchen knife.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins' lawyer, Karen Diebolt, argued that Collins was defending himself
after DiVirgilio, who was high on a mix of cocaine and alcohol, began repeatedly
punching Collins over a $150 stereo the youth bought on his mother's credit card
with her permission.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of Collins' family and friends burst into sobs after the verdict was
read. Collins, 18, then stood with his hands in his pockets and his head bowed
as each of the 12 jurors stood and called out "guilty" as they were polled by
the court.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm devastated," Diebolt said outside the courtroom. "We obviously thought
he was not guilty because this was self-defense. If I couldn't convince 12
people of that, I thought the compromise would be manslaughter. I never expected
straight murder."
</P>
<P>
	   Keegan said the verdict showed jurors did not believe Collins' account of
the events leading up to the stabbing.
</P>
<P>
	   "The crime scene totally conflicted with the version that Patrick Collins
gave," Keegan said. "The victim was unarmed and there were no signs of
struggle."
</P>
<P>
	   Relatives of DiVirgilio sat quietly together in the courtroom after the
verdict. Neither they nor Collins' relatives would comment Wednesday.

Serbs Threaten Protests in Kosovo

	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbs in this ethnically divided city
are threatening protests and more unrest in response to plans by NATO-led
peacekeepers to begin resettling ethnic Albanians on the Serb-controlled north
bank of the Ibar River. The plans announced Wednesday by the peacekeeping

States Have $7B of Unspent Welfare
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A coalition of anti-poverty groups said states are
hoarding $7 billion in unspent federal funds earmarked to help poor Americans
and called on governors to see to it that the money is used to assist low-income
families. Seventeen states each have accumulated more than $100 million in
unspent federal funds from 1997 to 1999. Other states have tens of millions of
dollars they haven't spent, a study by the National Campaign for Jobs and Income
showed. California had the most, with $1.6 billion. New York had the second
highest amount -- $1.1 billion -- and Ohio was third, with nearly $734 million.

Egypt Awaits, Prepares for Pope

journey to retrace some of the most epic passages from the Bible. The three-day
visit, scheduled to begin Thursday, has taken on dual dimensions: a highly
personal pilgrimage for the elderly pontiff and also an opportunity to promote
closer dialogue with Muslims and try to overcome old rifts with Orthodox
Christians. "We never could have imagined that we would have the pope under our
roof," said Samir Yassa, who designed the cathedral where John Paul plans to
meet Friday with Orthodox and Coptic clergymen in a display of their shared

gave him control of a NASA computer system. Ikenna Iffih, 28, a student at
Northeastern University's College of Computer Science, was charged Wednesday
with three counts related to hacking that carry up to 10 years in prison and a
fine of $250,000. "All in all, the defendant used his home computer to leave a
trail of cybercrime from coast to coast," U.S. Attorney Donald Stern said in a

Santana Wins Record-Tying 8 Grammys

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Carlos Santana, who first gained fame a generation ago
with a searing guitar performance at Woodstock, capped a triumphant comeback
Wednesday with a record-tying eight Grammy Awards. The 52-year-old guitarist's
multi-platinum "Supernatural" won album of the year. His first No. 1 single,
"Smooth," capped a sweep of the major Grammys by winning song and record of the
year. Santana tied Michael Jackson's 1983 record of most Grammys on a single
night. "Music is the vehicle for the magic of healing," he said upon accepting
the album of the year trophy, "and the music of 'Supernatural' was a sign and
designed to bring unity and harmony."

The defending NL West champions will have to be dragged kicking and screaming to
the other league, but they know they have no choice if that's what the other
owners decide to do. "It was a last-minute addition and I didn't like it, but we
had no choice," Diamondbacks owner Jerry Colangelo said as he watched the team's
first full-squad workout Wednesday. "I wasn't happy at the time and I'm not any
happier today."

<HEADLINE> Puffy Combs Hit With More Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Bribery charges have been added to gun possession counts
against rapper Sean "Puffy" Combs following a nightclub shooting in which three
people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs and bodyguard Anthony Jones were indicted Wednesday, accused of
offering $50,000 and a diamond ring to the driver of the sport utility vehicle
in which the three were riding the night of the shooting. Combs' girlfriend,
Jennifer Lopez, also was in the vehicle early Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs allegedly offered the ring -- a birthday present from Lopez -- as a

criticized the timing of their release.
</P>
<P>
	   "If this indictment was in fact timed to embarrass Mr. Combs on the evening

attorney," he said.

allegedly shot three people inside Club New York. The gunman, Jamal "Shyne"
Barrow, 19, was arrested separately and charged with three counts of attempted
murder.

<P>
	   Combs pleaded innocent to the weapons charges earlier this month. The
bribery charge carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison.

peacekeepers to begin resettling ethnic Albanians on the Serb-controlled north

States Have $7B of Unspent Welfare
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A coalition of anti-poverty groups said states are
hoarding $7 billion in unspent federal funds earmarked to help poor Americans
and called on governors to see to it that the money is used to assist low-income
families. Seventeen states each have accumulated more than $100 million in
unspent federal funds from 1997 to 1999. Other states have tens of millions of
dollars they haven't spent, a study by the National Campaign for Jobs and Income
showed. California had the most, with $1.6 billion. New York had the second
highest amount -- $1.1 billion -- and Ohio was third, with nearly $734 million.

journey to retrace some of the most epic passages from the Bible. The three-day
visit, scheduled to begin Thursday, has taken on dual dimensions: a highly
personal pilgrimage for the elderly pontiff and also an opportunity to promote
closer dialogue with Muslims and try to overcome old rifts with Orthodox
Christians. "We never could have imagined that we would have the pope under our

Santana Wins Record-Tying 8 Grammys

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Carlos Santana, who first gained fame a generation ago
with a searing guitar performance at Woodstock, capped a triumphant comeback
Wednesday with a record-tying eight Grammy Awards. The 52-year-old guitarist's
multi-platinum "Supernatural" won album of the year. His first No. 1 single,
"Smooth," capped a sweep of the major Grammys by winning song and record of the
year. Santana tied Michael Jackson's 1983 record of most Grammys on a single
night. "Music is the vehicle for the magic of healing," he said upon accepting
the album of the year trophy, "and the music of 'Supernatural' was a sign and
designed to bring unity and harmony."

happier today."

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Bribery charges have been added to gun possession counts
against rapper Sean "Puffy" Combs following a nightclub shooting in which three
people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs and bodyguard Anthony Jones were indicted Wednesday, accused of

<HEADLINE> Senate Ponders Fetus Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pushing a bill that would make harming a
fetus during a violent act a federal crime say it's past time the federal
government was in tune with states on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   But Democratic-led opponents are concerned that the measure will be used to
undermine abortion rights guaranteed in the 1973 Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court
decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-four states already have laws that recognize the unborn as potential
victims. Supporters said federal laws should also allow prosecutors to bring
non-capital murder charges in cases of violence where a fetus dies, even if the
mother survives.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill, which passed the House in September, would not apply to abortions
performed with the mother's consent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's time to deal with this issue at the federal level,'' Joseph Daly of
Ohio told a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Daly successfully lobbied Ohio officials to pass a similar law after his
wife Suzanne, three weeks away from delivering their first child, was hit by an
unlicensed driver in a stolen car. Both she and the baby died.
</P>
<P>
	   Some members of Congress expressed concern that the issue was being used as
a litmus test in the fight over abortion. They prefer alternatives like
strengthening existing laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We owe this country a serious response, not debate on ideological
proposals that ignore effective programs designed to help women crime victims,''
said Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on the Senate panel.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee's chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, denied any intent to
make the legislation a test case on abortion, but acknowledged that it was a
hot-button issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only opposition that I can suppose is that some in the pro-choice
movement believe that our bill draws attention to the effort to dehumanize,
desensitize and depersonalize the unborn child,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Eleanor D. Acheson, an assistant attorney general, said the Justice
Department would recommend President Clinton veto the legislation if it reaches
his desk. She said its ``identification of a fetus as a separate and distinct
victim of crime is unprecedented as a matter of federal statute.''
</P>
<P>
	   The bill ``is in our view, a flawed federal response to the evils of such
violence'' and ``may be perceived as gratuitously plunging the federal
government into one of the most difficult and complex issues of religious and
scientific consideration,'' Acheson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, she said, the administration favors alternative legislation that
would strengthen punishment for ``intentional violence against women whom the
perpetrator knows or should know is pregnant.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Senate Looks At Education Accounts  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying once more to put their stamp on the education
debate, Senate Republicans again are pushing an educational IRA plan that
President Clinton has vetoed twice in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill taken up by the Senate Wednesday would allow parents to place as
much as $2,000 per year, per child, in educational savings accounts. The
tax-free interest could be used for expenses, including transportation and
tutors, associated with any school -- public, private or parochial -- from
kindergarten through the 12th grade. The education IRAs would expire at the end
of 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill, costing $7.7 billion over 10 years, would also make savings in
prepaid tuition plans tax free and expand tax breaks for employer-provided
educational assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrat Robert Torricelli of New Jersey is a co-sponsor. He said about 10
of the Senate's 45 Democrats would support it, but the driving force is
Republicans who contend that the key to improving education is to give local
schools and parents more control over education dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats say education money should go to hiring more teachers and building
and repairing schoolhouses.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP majority ``again seeks to divert critical resources needed in our
public schools,'' said Education Secretary Richard Riley. ``Once again it is a
distraction from meaningful progress in education.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton vetoed a similar bill in 1998, saying more affluent families would
be the main beneficiaries and that it would encourage people to abandon public
schools. Republicans tried again in 1999, inserting the bill in their 10-year
$792 billion comprehensive tax cut plan that Clinton vetoed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are going to keep bringing this up, keep bringing it to the public
attention, keep sending it to the president,'' said Sen. Paul Coverdell of
Georgia, the chief Republican sponsor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This bill fails to address the serious needs of public schools. It fails
to meet the needs of the nation's children, and it fails to make much-needed
investments in America's future,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Education Association, in a letter to senators, also urged
rejection of the bill, saying it ignores the problems of public schools and
``would divert billions of dollars to tax breaks for private school ESAs.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Torricelli said it was the president who laid the foundation for
education savings accounts when he pushed the current program that allows
parents to contribute up to $500 a year with tax-deductible earnings available
for college expenses such as tuition and books.
</P>
<P>
	   He and Coverdell argued that it would lead to an education spending infusion
of $12 billion and that the main beneficiaries would be middle-class families
with children in public schools.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every segment of education in America will be a winner: public education,
private education, home schooling, you name it,'' Coverdell said. ``These
accounts will infuse new resources for which the federal government will not
have to appropriate a dime.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The bill number is S. 1134.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Revive Economic Theme  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Using the nation's vastly improved bottom line as a
backdrop, President Clinton is reprising the economic theme of a speech he gave
while running for president eight years ago, when his unofficial campaign motto
was ``It's the economy, stupid.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was returning to the Wharton School of Business at the University of
Pennsylvania today to sum up improvements in almost all corners of the economy
since he gave a previous speech there in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Also today, the White House was announcing a national summit of economic
thinkers and decision-makers to be held at the White House on April 5.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1992 Wharton speech was a showcase for Clinton's ideas on what seemed
like a national malaise -- seemingly permanent deficits, stubborn rates of
unemployment and otherwise lackluster economic measures, even though the nation
was actually coming out of a recession that year.
</P>
<P>
	   These days, Clinton frequently tells audiences that voters took a chance on
him in 1992 with the hope that he would improve their pocketbooks, and Clinton
claims he has done just that for most of America.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He went to Wharton in 1992 to talk about his ideas for turning the economy
around, new ideas for economic stewardship in this country,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart said that today's speech will recount the Clinton-Gore record ``and
also look to the future about what the proper role for government is in
providing stewardship for the economy, particularly in the areas of research and
science.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton regards the fields of science and technology as the most dynamic
economic arenas in America, and one that played a relatively small role in
national economic thinking eight years ago.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Owe $4.3M in Legal Fees  </HEADLINE>
   By PETE YOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clintons' legal defense fund might stay in business
after the president leaves office to help cover $4.3 million in outstanding
legal bills.
</P>
<P>
	   The fund's trustees held out the possibility of continuing their work next
year, while reporting that donations fell substantially in the last six months
of 1999 -- $800,000 compared with $2.4 million in the first part of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventeen donors gave the $10,000 maximum, accounting for nearly a quarter
of the $800,000 in contributions.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense fund donations so far this year are $400,000, giving the trustees
some reason to believe the Clintons will not have to deal with the bills, said
Anthony Essaye, the fund's executive director.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will continue to ask Americans to contribute to the Trust in the hopes
that the president and first lady can leave the White House ... largely free of
... debt,'' Essaye said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Essaye said that if the Clintons still have substantial legal bills next
January, the trustees will have to decide whether the fund should stay in
business.
</P>
<P>
	   While saying at one point that ``in all probability it will not'' continue,
Essaye later in the news conference said that it ``might stay in business''
after next January if the debt remains substantial.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clintons' have run up $10.7 million in legal bills since the Whitewater
investigation began in 1993. Lawyers for the president and first lady have been
paid $5.9 million, with $500,000 more collected and on the way.
</P>
<P>
	   One person connected to the Monica Lewinsky scandal, major Democratic
contributor Walter Kaye, was among the latest $10,000 contributors. Kaye helped
place Ms. Lewinsky in the White House intern program. Also giving $10,000 each
were film executive Lew Wasserman and Miramax Films co-chairman Harvey
Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
	   Wasserman and Weinstein also gave the fund $10,000 apiece in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has said he might be entitled to government reimbursement for his
legal expenses, but ``his instinct'' is not to seek it.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clintons' legal bills stem from various criminal investigations of their
activities, as well as the sexual harassment suit against the president by
former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the Independent Counsel statute, subjects of criminal investigations
who are not indicted may seek reimbursement of reasonable attorneys fees from
the special panel of judges that appoints the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   But the reimbursement question regarding Clinton is murky because he was
impeached by the House on perjury and obstruction charges, then acquitted by the
Senate.

<HEADLINE> Santana Wins Record-Tying 8 Grammys  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The comeback of Carlos Santana is triumphantly complete.
</P>
<P>
	   The guitar great who had just one minor Grammy to his credit in a 30-year
career won eight on Wednesday, tying the record set by Michael Jackson in 1983
for most trophies in one night. Santana's awards included the top honors, record
and album of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana brought grace, humility and spirituality to a show full of glitz and
glamor. The 52-year-old musician known best for his breathtaking guitar work
said he set out to make "Supernatural" a radio-friendly record to spread a
message of hope.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I can do it, people from the ghettos, the barrio, the shantytowns can do
it," the Mexican-born Santana said. "I know, because I came from there."
</P>
<P>
	   Other top winners at the 42nd annual Grammys included the soul trio TLC, who
won two Grammys -- for best rhythm 'n' blues for their frank put-down of men,
"No Scrubs," and best R&AMP;B album for "Fanmail." "No Scrubs" was also named best
R&AMP;B song.
</P>
<P>
	   Eminem won two awards, for best rap solo performance and best rap album.
</P>
<P>
	   Country's leading ladies, the Dixie Chicks and Shania Twain, won two Grammys
apiece. George Jones, who had a near-fatal traffic wreck last year, won best
male country vocal for "Choices."
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Bennett, now 73 and enjoying his own commercial resurgence, took the
Grammy for traditional pop vocal for his tribute to Duke Ellington.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is my ninth Grammy, and boy, I just feel like going back in the
recording studio and coming up with another one," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Christina Aguilera staged a mild upset for best new performer over fellow
teen queen Britney Spears. Aguilera said she was so sure someone else would win
that she did not prepare a speech.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was expecting it to go to somebody actually who had more singles out this
year, so this is totally, totally unexpected," Aguilera said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sting scored his own upset for male pop vocal with "Brand New Day," beating
out younger, Latin-influenced singers Marc Anthony and Ricky Martin. Sting also
won for pop album.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana's wins were clearly no upsets. He was the favorite of the audience,
which gave him standing ovations and cheered each time his name was mentioned as
a nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   "This validates that together, we can heal this planet," he said. "There's
so much gossip and sensationalism, it's nice to demonstrate to people that
dignity and class can do as well."
</P>
<P>
	   Santana's triumph was reminiscent of the Grammys two years ago, when rock
veterans Bob Dylan and John Fogerty won top awards. Neither Dylan nor Fogerty,
leader of Creedence Clearwater Revival, had won Grammys in their prime years in
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite continued critical acclaim for Santana, recent records have sold
modestly compared to multi-platinum 1970s albums as "Santana" and "Abraxas." A
deeply spiritual man who is a longtime devotee of Indian guru Sri Chinmoy,
Santana's first words upon winning album of the year were a Hebrew prayer, which
translates to: "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts."
</P>
<P>
	   Santana's other honors included best rock album, pop collaboration with
vocals, rock instrumental and pop performance by a duo or group with vocals.
With nearly 6 million copies sold, "Supernatural" is the best-selling album for
Santana, whose career caught fire after Woodstock in 1969.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the credit for the album's success goes to Santana's musical guests,
including fellow guitar veteran Eric Clapton and younger musicians such as
Lauryn Hill, Dave Matthews, Everlast, Wyclef Jean and Rob Thomas, who co-wrote
and sang on "Smooth," which won record of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas said the collaborations helped introduce Santana's music to younger
listeners.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not that I think Carlos had a comeback," Thomas said. "He was just
opened up to a few more layers, more ages of people."
</P>
<P>
	   Santana heaped praise on his collaborators, thanking Everlast for "writing
that incredible spiritual song, 'Put Your Lights On,"' and Thomas for the
"wonderful lyrics and performance" on "Smooth."
</P>
<P>
	   The guitarist also honored producer Clive Davis, who released "Supernatural"
on his Arista label and first signed Santana to Columbia Records in the late
1960s. Santana took the stage side-by-side with Davis to accept the top album
Grammy.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana's success and staying power in the business are a lesson for
up-and-coming performers, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anytime an artist breaks through, they wonder how long they can last," said
Davis, embroiled in a power struggle with Arista's owner, BMG. "This album shows
that if the music is great, not only will it last, but it can soar."
</P>
<P>
	   With "Supernatural" as his latest steppingstone, Santana said he hopes to
make good on such goals as playing in China and Cuba and performing for Nelson
Mandela and Desmond Tutu in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   And true to the success and eclectic lineup of "Supernatural," he said he
hopes to record with such musicians as Ry Cooder and Alice Coltrane, "but do it
in a way so you can still hear the song on the radio."

<HEADLINE> Grammys Favor '70s Icons  </HEADLINE>
    By BETH HARRIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- You're never too old to win your first Grammy. Just ask
'70s icons Cher, Barry White and Black Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
	   Youngsters like Britney Spears, Ricky Martin, Marc Anthony and the
Backstreet Boys -- who had some of 1999's best-selling albums -- will have to
wait another year to grab a Grammy.
</P>
<P>
	   Cher, 53, won best dance recording at Wednesday night's ceremonies for
"Believe," the biggest hit of a career that began in the 1960s with then-husband
Sonny Bono.
</P>
<P>
	   White, the soulful love god known for the '70s hit "Can't Get Enough of Your
Love, Babe," earned male rhythm and blues vocal and traditional R&AMP;B vocal
trophies for the appropriately titled "Staying Power."
</P>
<P>
	   White, 55, triumphed over such younger competition as R. Kelly, Maxwell and
Tyrese in the R&AMP;B vocal category.
</P>
<P>
	   Black Sabbath, formerly fronted by Ozzy Osborne and known for such metal
classics "Paranoid," was honored for best metal performance with "Iron Man."
Drummer Bill Ward said it was gratifying to see artists from the Woodstock
generation, including the night's top winner, Carlos Santana, doing so well.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's totally cool," he said. "I didn't think that 31 years ago, I'd
be standing up in a suit. I feel more like an accountant than the guy who plays
drums in Black Sabbath."
</P>
<P>
	   Santana, the 52-year-old guitarist who shot to fame at Woodstock in 1969,
picked up eight Grammys, tying Michael Jackson's record for the most in one
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Clive Davis, who launched the careers of Santana, Whitney Houston, Sarah
McLachlan and Bruce Springsteen, lauded Santana for his cross-generational
impact.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're an inspiration to every young musician throughout the globe because
when they break in they don't know how long a career can not only last, but how
long it can soar," Davis said. "And to those established musicians who've been
No. 1, how to get back after years."
</P>
<P>
	   Country veterans George Jones and June Carter Cash, whose health travails
have received almost as much ink as their music in recent years, received their
first Grammys since 1970.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones, the 68-year-old who was nearly killed in a car wreck last year, won
male country vocal for "Choices."
</P>
<P>
	   Cash, the 70-year-old wife of Johnny Cash, picked up her third career Grammy
for "Press On" in the traditional folk album category.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Spears, Latin heartthrobs Martin and Anthony, R&AMP;B singer Brandy,
all-boy groups Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync and rapper Kid Rock were allo shut
out.
</P>
<P>
	   But there was Christina Aguilera, the 19-year-old singer who earned her
first Grammy, for best new artist. She defeated fellow teen diva Spears, who
commanded greater attention for her sales and sex appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Aguilera said she hoped to follow in the footsteps of her idol, Mariah
Carey, who won best new artist in 1990. Carey sings, writes and produces much of
her own material.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want more writing credibility on the next album," Aguilera said. "It's
really wanting to be seen as a vocalist, because that's where my heart is and
trying to take pop a little bit deeper than it is now. I wish it wasn't just
about image."

<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sure, Erykah Badu can sing, but she also made her mark
with a sleek outfit and her signature -- and symbolic -- headwrap.
</P>
<P>
	   In a performance with jazz musicians George Benson and Diana Krall at
Wednesday night's Grammys, she wore a yellow turban-like hat, a kelly green
shirt, striped skirt and red pumps.
</P>
<P>
	   "The headwrap is political," said the singer, who turns 29 on Saturday.
"This headwrap is a symbol for every group of people who has their own set of
rules.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's beautiful and I enjoy wearing it and I enjoy people complimenting me
(on it)," she said, saying it's an "ego thing" and represents "strength."
</P>
<P>
	   She and The Roots won a Grammy for their hit "You Got Me."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Erykah Badu wasn't the only one with a striking wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
	   Actress and singer Jennifer Lopez, appearing onstage with "X-Files" star
David Duchovny to announce the award for best R&AMP;B album, sported a dress that
left virtually nothing to the imagination.
</P>
<P>
	   The long sleeve, green-and-blue dress had two wide V's in the front: one
plunging down to her midriff and one coming up with a sequined pin holding it
together below her waist.
</P>
<P>
	   The ensemble prompted emcee Rosie O'Donnell to joke after a commercial
break: "You know, it's always great to see Jennifer Lopez in a classy
understated number like that. She wonders why people make fun of her body."
</P>
<P>
	   O'Donnell also got in a gibe at Sean "Puffy" Combs, Lopez's boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   "Good news everyone, Puff Daddy has left the building," she announced at one
point. "He was in the front row and it's a comfort to me, trust me."
</P>
<P>
	   The rapper faces gun possession and bribery charges following a Dec. 27
shooting at a New York nightclub that wounded three people. He has said he is
innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest standing ovation of the night didn't go to big winner Carlos
Santana -- it went to five young musicians.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences, said he searched for two years to get the right group of kids together
and, in the end, had to choose from "thousands of tapes."
</P>
<P>
	   "I wasn't necessarily looking for the flashiest kids," Greene said. "The
kids were really heartfelt and super musicians."
</P>
<P>
	   The winners: Matthew Brewer, 16, a bass player from Rio Rancho, N.M.; Rachel
Lee, 11, of Scarsdale, N.Y., a classical violinist; Eldar Djangirov, 13, a jazz
pianist originally from Kyrgyzstan and now living in Kansas City, Mo; Tony
Royster, Jr., 15, of Hiensville, Ga., on drums; and Julian Lage, 12, a guitarist
from Santa Rosa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   The group practiced together for two days, performing the Thelonious Monk
piece "Straight, No Chaser."
</P>
<P>
	   The group had some tips for young aspiring artists.
</P>
<P>
	   "Just try to keep learning," Lage said. "Try different stuff and don't limit
yourself to anything."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The Grammys returned to an arena setting for only the second time in the
show's 42-year history. The 20,000-seat Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles
has nearly four times the capacity of the Shrine Auditorium, where last year's
show was held.
</P>
<P>
	   The move allowed the 14,000-member National Academy of Recording Arts &AMP;
Sciences to invite more industry representatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Diana Krall, whose "When I Look in Your Eyes" won for jazz vocal
performance, said intimacy wasn't lost in the larger setting.
</P>
<P>
	   "I liked it, especially when you look down and see Tony Bennett in the front
row. That's nice," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Tito Puente, a Latin band leader for 50 years with 118 albums to his credit,
says he has another accomplishment: role model.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm very honored to be here and I hope I continue to be a role model to all
the young Latin people coming up in this profession," Puente said backstage.
</P>
<P>
	   Puente's fifth Grammy was for best traditional tropical Latin performance
for "Mambo Birdland."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the explosion of Latin music chart-toppers has helped bolster his
own career, which has seen 10 Grammy nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   "Well, it doesn't hurt, but I'm not Ricky Martin, I'm not Marc Anthony --
I'm sure not Jennifer Lopez," said Puente, wiggling his behind in an apparent
reference to the actress and her much-hyped derriere.
</P>
<P>
	   Puente also introduced his son backstage, Tito Puente Jr., who has a music
career of his own. His style is different from his dad's classic tunes -- he
plays house music.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Blues guitar master B. B. King, his ninth Grammy in hand, said he has
already made plans for a posthumous career.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've had some friends encourage me to retire and they ask me when I would
and my answer is five to 10 years after I am dead," said the 74-year-old
musician.
</P>
<P>
	   King got his first Grammy in 1970. On Wednesday, he won for best traditional
blues album for "Blues on the Bayou." He is working on an album with Eric
Clapton.
</P>
<P>
	   "What can I tell you -- I just wish I could do more," King said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another nine-time winner, 73-year-old singer Tony Bennett, says he has no
plans to stop singing.
</P>
<P>
	   "I love what I'm doing ... it's such an adventure," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett won for best traditional pop vocal performance for his "Bennett
Sings Ellington -- Hot &AMP; Cool."
</P>
<P>
	   He wouldn't reveal what project he's working on next, saying he thinks it
"would be lifted by someone else."

<HEADLINE> Clintons Host Lavish State Dinner  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It began with a stumbling queen but ended in a song. In
between, President Clinton toasted the king of Spain for defending democracy,
and Washington power-brokers mingled with Hollywood stars at the first state
dinner of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   The lavish affair for 170 guests, which featured a performance by tenor
Placido Domingo, was the highlight of Hillary Rodham Clinton's first return to a
public schedule in the White House since launching her Senate political campaign
in New York on Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mrs. Clinton has always taken an active role in the planning for state
dinners, and despite her busy schedule in New York she was able to be involved
in all aspects of the usual preparations for the Spain dinner,'' spokeswoman
Toby Graff said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clintons greeted King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia on the South Lawn of
the White House on Wednesday morning in an official ceremony punctuated by
reminders of the threat terrorism poses to freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   The king condemned a car bombing Tuesday that killed two people in the
Basque capital of Vitoria, accusing Basque separatists blamed for the attack of
trying to ``impose their totalitarian ideas by force'' at the expense of human
life.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton praised Juan Carlos for his ``stand against the forces of terror and
the enemies of freedom,'' particularly for his stand against an armed militia
that stormed the Spanish parliament in a coup attempt on Feb. 23, 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   The president expressed his condolences to the families of the bombing
victims and said that ``in a democracy we must settle our differences with
dialogue, not destruction.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's evening's state dinner began on a slightly awkward note when the
queen stumbled in her long black and gray gown as she scaled the North Portico
steps to meet the Clintons. She reached out with her hands to save herself from
a bad fall, and the president reached down and grabbed her shoulders to help her
recover.
</P>
<P>
	   Guests were seated around 17 tables in the State Dining Room and the Red
Room that were bedecked with white orchids, Virginia roses and slender tapers in
golden candelabras.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those attending were actors Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan, Diane Keaton
and Whoopie Goldberg, several lawmakers and Cabinet officials and Vice President
Al Gore's daughter Karenna Gore Schiff, who studied in Spain, and her husband,
Dr. Andrew Schiff.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the rigors of campaigning, Mrs. Clinton was at the White House to
choose the place settings and set the menu, which included for dessert a topiary
of white chocolate styled like a crate filled with sherbet oranges, lemons and
limes.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton chose the Eisenhower china, white with wide rims of gold, to
accompany champagne-colored brocade tablecloths. The menu featured the sort of
full-flavored dishes best appreciated on a chilly night: lobster and Maine
shrimp served with risotto and chorizo; grilled rack of lamb with blood orange
and rosemary sauce.
</P>
<P>
	   The wine served with the main course was a robust pinot noir from the Artesa
vineyard near Santa Barbara, Calif.; with dessert the royals were treated to a
Gloria Ferrer Royal Cuvee brut, which was developed in honor of their visit to
California's Napa Valley in 1983.
</P>
<P>
	   The evening was topped off with five songs from zarzuelas to Leonard
Berstein's ``Tonight,'' sung by Domingo, who won a Grammy on Wednesday while he
waited to perform in the East Room, and soprano Ana Maria Martinez.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker: NIH Sent Wrong Medicine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Institutes of Health shipped the wrong
gene-based medicine to a university that administered it to six patients, a
congressman says.
</P>
<P>
	   "Providing the wrong medication to patients is an act of inexcusable
incompetence," Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., wrote to the NIH on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   He asked what steps the government was taking to ensure it never happens
again.
</P>
<P>
	   Georgetown University spokesman Paul Donovan said Wednesday that university
researchers did not catch the error and consequently administered the wrong
medicine to six cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
	   But "all patients were immediately notified and no patient experienced any
adverse effect," Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Cancer Institute, the NIH branch that made the error, agreed
that no patients were harmed -- they received an experimental gene-based drug
that would not work for their tumors, but that was being prepared for testing in
patients with other types of cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was no safety issue," said Dr. Michaele Christian, NCI's associate
director of cancer therapy evaluation.
</P>
<P>
	   But because drug mixups have the potential to be very serious, she said she
already has taken steps to prevent future errors.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem is the label on these vials of medicine is small and the first
five letters of two drugs' names are identical, setting the stage for an easy
mixup, she explained.
</P>
<P>
	   Waxman's discovery of the problem came as part of an investigation into how
the NIH oversees gene therapy, in wake of the September death of an Arizona
teen-ager in a gene therapy experiment.
</P>
<P>
	   Waxman claimed Wednesday that NIH's records show no sign the agency
investigated 38 other deaths in two gene therapy experiments. One was a 1996
death in a University of Pennsylvania cystic fibrosis study; the others were
among 38 people with end-stage lung cancer enrolled in a Texas study.

<HEADLINE> WTO Rejects US Appeal on Tax Breaks  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Billions of dollars in tax breaks for U.S. exports have
been ruled an illegal subsidy by the World Trade Organization, but the issue is
far from settled.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States believes a WTO panel was wrong in siding with the European
Union in the dispute, Rita Hayes, U.S. ambassador to the trade group, said
today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will seek a solution that ensures that American firms and workers are
not disadvantaged relative to their European counterparts,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky confirmed Wednesday that the
WTO panel had ruled the tax incentives, known as the Foreign Sales Corporation
program, are an illegal subsidy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We strongly disagree with the appellate body's ruling,'' Barshefsky said.
``Our view remains that the FSC is completely consistent with U.S.-WTO
obligations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the United States will not abandon
the program and will pursue negotiations intended to avoid retaliation from the
European Union, which brought the WTO challenge.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers, in an interview Wednesday with The Associated Press, said the
Clinton administration is ``clear in our commitment to finding a way to maintain
the important incentives for U.S. exports that have been provided in the past.
I'm sure we'll find a way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Foreign Sales Corporation program enables U.S. makers of computer
software, chemicals, machinery and many other products to shield some export
income from taxes. The tax breaks for companies such as Microsoft, Boeing and
General Motors would be worth more than $15 billion over the next five years,
according to congressional estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional leaders are urging a negotiated deal, particularly because
changes in the law stemming from the WTO decision would be tricky, costly and
time-consuming. Also, opponents might seize the opportunity in an election year
to attack the program as corporate welfare.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are concerned that if this matter is not resolved bilaterally ... this
is likely to lead to a highly charged tax and trade environment that we are sure
all parties would like to avoid,'' lawmakers, including Sen. William Roth,
R-Del., and Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, said in a recent letter to the
administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The program was created in 1984 to offset tax rebates European companies get
when they sell products outside the EU. It permits U.S. companies to avoid
certain income taxes by setting up export subsidiaries on offshore tax havens
such as the U.S. Virgin Islands, Barbados and Guam.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies that enjoy this tax break are awaiting nervously the WTO
decision. They fear it could lead to another trade war with the Europeans or
require a major rewrite of the U.S. tax code that would reduce the benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We stand to lose tax parity with our trading partners,'' said Steve
Elkins, the top tax official at the Chemical Manufacturers Association. ``And we
stand to be retaliated against through tariffs against U.S. exports.''
</P>
<P>
	   Martin Regalia, economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said an end to
the Foreign Sales Corporation program ``puts our companies at a comparative
disadvantage. We don't want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Europeans, on the other hand, contend the program has reached beyond its
original limits, particularly in 1997 when it was extended to U.S. computer
software makers such as Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU trade commissioner, Pascal Lemy, said recently that the expanded
program was ``granting an unfair advantage to U.S. products'' in many parts of
the world.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear whether the EU would retaliate through higher tariffs if
the United States does not make fundamental changes, and some European companies
benefit from the tax breaks through their U.S. subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, the program could become a bargaining chip in other U.S.-EU
trade disputes over bananas, beef growth hormones and aerospace products. Some
observers also believe the dispute could provide an opening for all of these
issues to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all want to avoid a continuing round of trade disputes,'' Elkins said.
``We are hopeful that the Europeans will realize it.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Rises 10; Nasdaq Climbs 34  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is up ten points in
today's early going. Advancing and declining issues are evenly split on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq Composite Index is ahead 34 points and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
Stock Index is up a fraction.
</P>
<P>
	   We'll see what the Nasdaq can do for an encore after the index posted its
biggest single-day point gain ever yesterday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq began today's session from a record high, so any additional gains
today would take it deeper into record territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, analysts say the Dow appears to be going through a rather volatile
bottoming process, testing support levels as it suffers through waves of
selling.
</P>
<P>
	   There could be a measure of support today from the Treasury market, where
bond prices are higher following data that showed a decline in demand for
durable goods last month.

<HEADLINE> WTO Rejects U.S. Tax Breaks  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Billions of dollars in tax breaks for U.S. exports have
been ruled an illegal subsidy by the World Trade Organization, but the issue is
far from settled.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States believes a WTO panel was wrong in siding with the European
Union in the dispute, Rita Hayes, U.S. ambassador to the trade group, said
today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will seek a solution that ensures that American firms and workers are
not disadvantaged relative to their European counterparts,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky confirmed Wednesday that the
WTO panel had ruled the tax incentives, known as the Foreign Sales Corporation
program, are an illegal subsidy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We strongly disagree with the appellate body's ruling,'' Barshefsky said.
``Our view remains that the FSC is completely consistent with U.S.-WTO
obligations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the United States will not abandon
the program and will pursue negotiations intended to avoid retaliation from the
European Union, which brought the WTO challenge.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers, in an interview Wednesday with The Associated Press, said the
Clinton administration is ``clear in our commitment to finding a way to maintain
the important incentives for U.S. exports that have been provided in the past.
I'm sure we'll find a way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement today, Summers said he was disappointed with the WTO ruling
and insisted that Foreign Sales Corporations are ``widely viewed as creating a
level playing field with European tax systems and are important to our business
community.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will work closely with the Europeans, the business community and the
Congress to achieve a constructive solution,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Foreign Sales Corporation program enables U.S. makers of computer
software, chemicals, machinery and many other products to shield some export
income from taxes. The tax breaks for companies such as Microsoft, Boeing and
General Motors would be worth more than $15 billion over the next five years,
according to congressional estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Union puts the five-year price tag at $17.5 billion; the
administration estimates $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, welcomed the ruling. ``The FSC
system and its predecessor have had a major negative effect on international
trade to the detriment of European companies,'' he said in a statement from
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course we think that WTO members should be free to decide on their own
tax systems. But each member must do so fairly and in line with the rules,''
Lamy said
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional leaders are urging a negotiated deal, particularly because
changes in the law stemming from the WTO decision would be tricky, costly and
time-consuming. Also, opponents might seize the opportunity in an election year
to attack the program as corporate welfare.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are concerned that if this matter is not resolved bilaterally ... this
is likely to lead to a highly charged tax and trade environment that we are sure
all parties would like to avoid,'' lawmakers, including Sen. William Roth,
R-Del., and Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, said in a recent letter to the
administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The program was created in 1984 to offset tax rebates European companies get
when they sell products outside the EU. It permits U.S. companies to avoid
certain income taxes by setting up export subsidiaries on offshore tax havens
such as the U.S. Virgin Islands, Barbados and Guam.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies that enjoy this tax break fear the WTO decision could lead to
another trade war with the Europeans or require a major rewrite of the U.S. tax
code that would reduce the benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We stand to lose tax parity with our trading partners,'' said Steve
Elkins, the top tax official at the Chemical Manufacturers Association. ``And we
stand to be retaliated against through tariffs against U.S. exports.''
</P>
<P>
	   Martin Regalia, economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said an end to
the Foreign Sales Corporation program ``puts our companies at a comparative
disadvantage. We don't want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Europeans, on the other hand, contend the program has reached beyond its
original limits, particularly in 1997 when it was extended to U.S. computer
software-makers such as Microsoft.

<HEADLINE> Senate Votes on Iran Sanctions Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate is voting today on a bill that singles out
Russia for possible sanctions if it supplies Iran with weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota predicted overwhelming
support among senators who want to send ``as strong a message'' as possible
about the transfer of dangerous weapons and materials.
</P>
<P>
	   The House passed a very similar bill last September by 419-0, and is
expected to quickly adapt the Senate version and send it on to the president.
The White House last year threatened to veto the House bill, saying it would
weaken the U.S. ability to persuade the international community to halt weapons
transfers to Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   But Democratic leaders said the administration, while still opposed, is now
satisfied the bill would give the president enough flexibility to deal with
different circumstances, and would not recommend a veto.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the legislation, the president would be required to submit reports to
Congress every six months to identify countries such as Russia, China and North
Korea providing Iran with materiel to promote its missile and weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
	   The president would have the option of cutting off arms sales or economic
aid to nations helping Iran's weapons programs. He could waive sanctions for
national security reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill also would bar the United States from making payments to the
Russian space agency for helping build the International Space Station until the
president determines that Russia is actively opposing proliferation in Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton vetoed legislation in 1998 that, unlike the current bill, would have
required sanctions against those helping Iran build missiles.
</P>
<P>
	   Heading off a possible veto override, Vice President Al Gore shortly
thereafter announced sanctions on seven Russian entities suspected of
transferring weapons technology to Iran. In 1999 three more Russian groups were
added to the list.
</P>
<P>
	   Legislators said the administrative action, while needed, did not go far
enough and that the growing influence of reformists in Iran's government did not
obviate the threat posed by Iran's weapons program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The danger is still there, and those who are in charge of nuclear
proliferation in Iran have a very strong grip on what's being done,'' said
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill ``sends a message to our friends in Russia about the intensity of
our concern about their part in helping Iran develop weapons of mass
destruction,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., a chief sponsor.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The bill is H.R. 83.

<HEADLINE> Grammys Favor '70s Icons  </HEADLINE>
    By BETH HARRIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- You're never too old to win your first Grammy. Just ask
'70s icons Cher, Barry White and Black Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
	   Youngsters like Britney Spears, Ricky Martin, Marc Anthony and the
Backstreet Boys -- who had some of 1999's best-selling albums -- will have to
wait another year to grab a Grammy.
</P>
<P>
	   Cher, 53, won best dance recording at Wednesday night's ceremonies for
"Believe," the biggest hit of a career that began in the 1960s with then-husband
Sonny Bono.
</P>
<P>
	   White, the soulful love god known for the '70s hit "Can't Get Enough of Your
Love, Babe," earned male rhythm and blues vocal and traditional R&AMP;B vocal
trophies for the appropriately titled "Staying Power."
</P>
<P>
	   White, 55, triumphed over such younger competition as R. Kelly, Maxwell and
Tyrese in the R&AMP;B vocal category.
</P>
<P>
	   Black Sabbath, formerly fronted by Ozzy Osborne and known for such metal
classics "Paranoid," was honored for best metal performance with "Iron Man."
Drummer Bill Ward said it was gratifying to see artists from the Woodstock
generation, including the night's top winner, Carlos Santana, doing so well.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's totally cool," he said. "I didn't think that 31 years ago, I'd
be standing up in a suit. I feel more like an accountant than the guy who plays
drums in Black Sabbath."
</P>
<P>
	   Santana, the 52-year-old guitarist who shot to fame at Woodstock in 1969,
picked up eight Grammys, tying Michael Jackson's record for the most in one
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Clive Davis, who launched the careers of Santana, Whitney Houston, Sarah
McLachlan and Bruce Springsteen, lauded Santana for his cross-generational
impact.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're an inspiration to every young musician throughout the globe because
when they break in they don't know how long a career can not only last, but how
long it can soar," Davis said. "And to those established musicians who've been
No. 1, how to get back after years."
</P>
<P>
	   Country veterans George Jones and June Carter Cash, whose health travails
have received almost as much ink as their music in recent years, received their
first Grammys since 1970.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones, the 68-year-old who was nearly killed in a car wreck last year, won
male country vocal for "Choices."
</P>
<P>
	   Cash, the 70-year-old wife of Johnny Cash, picked up her third career Grammy
for "Press On" in the traditional folk album category.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Spears, Latin heartthrobs Martin and Anthony, R&AMP;B singer Brandy,
all-boy groups Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync and rapper Kid Rock were all shut
out.
</P>
<P>
	   But there was Christina Aguilera, the 19-year-old singer who earned her
first Grammy, for best new artist. She defeated fellow teen diva Spears, who
commanded greater attention for her sales and sex appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Aguilera said she hoped to follow in the footsteps of her idol, Mariah
Carey, who won best new artist in 1990. Carey sings, writes and produces much of
her own material.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want more writing credibility on the next album," Aguilera said. "It's
really wanting to be seen as a vocalist, because that's where my heart is and
trying to take pop a little bit deeper than it is now. I wish it wasn't just
about image."

<HEADLINE> Thailand Warns Teens About MSG  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand's public health ministry said Thursday it
was warning teen-agers against using the food additive MSG as a sexual
stimulant.
</P>
<P>
	   The ministry acted after receiving a report claiming teen-agers in the
northern province of Chiang Mai were mixing MSG, or monosodium glutamate, with
carbonated soft drinks and drinking the concoction in the belief that it acted
as an aphrodisiac.
</P>
<P>
	   Ingesting too much MSG can cause nausea, numbness of the back and neck and
faintness, deputy Health Minister Kamron na Lampoon said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
	   MSG is often used in the preparation of Chinese food and is found in some
instant foods, such as canned soup and frozen dinners
</P>
<P>
	   There was no explanation of why the teens thought MSG affected sexual
prowess.
</P>
<P>
	   The ministry said it sent warning letters to every school in Chiang Mai,
explaining the situation and urging teachers to closely monitor students to
prevent them from becoming obsessed with sex and engaging in unsafe sex that
could lead to HIV infections.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Revive Economic Theme  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Using the nation's vastly improved bottom line as a
backdrop, President Clinton is reprising the economic theme of a speech he gave
while running for president eight years ago, when his unofficial campaign motto
was ``It's the economy, stupid.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was returning to the Wharton School of Business at the University of
Pennsylvania today to sum up improvements in almost all corners of the economy
since he gave a previous speech there in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Also today, the White House announced a national summit of economic thinkers
and decision-makers to be held at the White House on April 5. Clinton will lay
out goals for that meeting during the Wharton speech and during another address
today before CEOs in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1992 Wharton speech was a showcase for Clinton's ideas on what seemed
like a national malaise -- seemingly permanent deficits, stubborn rates of
unemployment and otherwise lackluster economic measures, even though the nation
was actually coming out of a recession that year.
</P>
<P>
	   These days, Clinton frequently tells audiences that voters took a chance on
him in 1992 with the hope that he would improve their pocketbooks, and Clinton
claims he has done just that for most of America.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He went to Wharton in 1992 to talk about his ideas for turning the economy
around, new ideas for economic stewardship in this country,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart said that today's speech will recount the Clinton-Gore record ``and
also look to the future about what the proper role for government is in
providing stewardship for the economy, particularly in the areas of research and
science.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton regards the fields of science and technology as the most dynamic
economic arenas in America, and one that played a relatively small role in
national economic thinking eight years ago.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. Reviews Deutch Case  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department is reviewing former CIA Director
John Deutch's misuse of classified information on a home computer and how the
case was handled, Attorney General Janet Reno said today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The department is looking at the whole matter, reviewing the whole matter
to see whether there is any basis for further action,'' Reno told her weekly
news conference. She said the goal is ``to determine whether there is any action
that the Department of Justice should take.''
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch has apologized to a Senate committee for moving classified data to an
unprotected computer in his home that was occasionally connected to the
Internet. Now a private consultant, he was stripped of his CIA security
clearances as a result. The CIA inspector general also criticized top CIA
officials for not quickly referring the incident to the Justice Department for
possible criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   Last spring after a yearlong review of the 1996 episode, the Justice
Department's criminal division declined to prosecute Deutch for mishandling
classified information. The division found the lapses were sloppy rather than
nefarious and referred the case to the CIA inspector general for administrative
discipline.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno and her aides declined today to specify what questions were being
reviewed. They said only that the entire matter was under scrutiny when asked
whether the Deutch criminal investigation could be reopened or whether there was
any obstruction of justice of top CIA officials.
</P>
<P>
	   One Justice official, requesting anonymity, said two criminal division
lawyers are handling the review. The review is more comprehensive than the one
the Justice Department announced three weeks ago, this official said. At that
time, Justice lawyers were said to be taking a look at the CIA inspector
general's report, but, based on information then available, there were no plans
to reopen the Deutch investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice officials also said earlier this month that material in the
inspector general's report and emerging from congressional hearings into the
Deutch episode was already known to the criminal division when it declined to
prosecute last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., is
determined to proceed with his inquiry despite public and private apologies from
Deutch.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no excuse for this kind of behavior,'' Sen. Richard Shelby said
this week after Deutch appeared before his panel.
</P>
<P>
	   In his first public comments on his computer practices, Deutch told
reporters after Tuesday's closed-door session he erred in doing classified work
on unsecured home computers connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby said his panel will recall Deutch and wants to hear from present
senior CIA officials, including Director George Tenet, on why it took so long to
strip Deutch of his security clearances or to notify the Justice Department and
Congress that an investigation was under way.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch left the CIA in December 1996. Tenet had his predecessor's security
clearances removed last August. Deutch, a former deputy defense secretary, also
held onto a Pentagon security clearance but gave it up this month.
</P>
<P>
	   The CIA inspector general's report says Tenet ``should have involved himself
more forcefully to ensure a proper resolution of the matter.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, CIA spokesman Bill Harlow said Tenet considers Deutch's
mishandling of classified information ``inexcusable.'' The inspector general's
report ``paints a picture of individuals struggling with the challenge of
conducting a sensitive security investigation of the agency's former director.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We could have and should have done better,'' Harlow added.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Recommends Changes to Boats  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID A. LIEB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The National Transportation Safety Board
recommended today that backup floation devices be installed in amphibious boats
to prevent the kind of rapid flooding that sank a tourist boat last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Miss Majestic, a type of boat called a ``duck'' because it travels on
both land and water, plunged to the bottom of Lake Hamilton in a matter of
minutes May 1 after taking on water. Thirteen passengers drowned.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Coast Guard in December concluded that a dislodged drive-shaft seal
allowed water to flood the hull. The boat's bilge pump failed to work.
</P>
<P>
	   The NTSB said boat operators should not rely on the pumps only, recommending
the installation of backup flotation devices -- watertight bulkheads, buoyant
materials inside the hull or flotation attachments on the outside of the boat.
</P>
<P>
	   Amphibious boats sink easily because they have no backup flotation, NTSB
Chairman Jim Hall said in a letter asking the industry to respond to the
recommendations within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Consequently, the safety board concludes that the potential exists for
another life-threatening accident similar to the sinking of the Miss Majestic,
unless the vulnerability to flooding and sinking is addressed,'' the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The boat that sank in Arkansas was a vintage World War II vessel designed
for military purposes, then converted to take tourists through the Hot Springs
area.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationwide, more than 250 amphibious passenger boats are in service. Most
are ducks and the rest are similar models.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 18 amphibious boats had accidents -- six involving some degree of
flooding -- between March 6, 1991, and May 1, 1999, according to Coast Guard
data. None was fatal.
</P>
<P>
	   The safety board said it has learned of at least nine other incidents
involving significant flooding that were not reported to the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
	   Amphibious boats have several flooding threats. The safety board said water
can leak in through a failed hull fitting, missing plug or a hull that is
cracked by running aground. Also, the road travel and repeated entry and exit
from water can wear on the vessel's hull and loosen mechanical joints and
connections.
</P>
<P>
	   Because the boats have open interiors and a low amount of space between the
stern and the water, it doesn't take long for the boats to flood and sink, the
NTSB said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Targets Russian Aid to Iran  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today unanimously passed a bill that singles
out Russia for possible sanctions if it supplies Iran with weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said senators want to
send ``as strong a message'' as possible about the transfer of dangerous weapons
and materials. The vote was 98-0.
</P>
<P>
	   The House passed a very similar bill last September by 419-0, and is
expected to quickly adapt the Senate version and send it on to the president.
The White House last year threatened to veto the House bill, saying it would
weaken the U.S. ability to persuade the international community to halt weapons
transfers to Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   But Democratic leaders said the administration, while still opposed, is now
satisfied the bill would give the president enough flexibility to deal with
different circumstances, and would not recommend a veto.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the legislation, the president would be required to submit reports to
Congress every six months to identify countries such as Russia, China and North
Korea providing Iran with materiel to promote its missile and weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
	   The president would have the option of cutting off arms sales or economic
aid to nations helping Iran's weapons programs. He could waive sanctions for
national security reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill also would bar the United States from making payments to the
Russian space agency for helping build the International Space Station until the
president determines that Russia is actively opposing proliferation in Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton vetoed legislation in 1998 that, unlike the current bill, would have
required sanctions against those helping Iran build missiles.
</P>
<P>
	   Heading off a possible veto override, Vice President Al Gore shortly
thereafter announced sanctions on seven Russian entities suspected of
transferring weapons technology to Iran. In 1999 three more Russian groups were
added to the list.
</P>
<P>
	   Legislators said the administrative action, while needed, did not go far
enough and that the growing influence of reformists in Iran's government did not
obviate the threat posed by Iran's weapons program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The danger is still there, and those who are in charge of nuclear
proliferation in Iran have a very strong grip on what's being done,'' said
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill ``sends a message to our friends in Russia about the intensity of
our concern about their part in helping Iran develop weapons of mass
destruction,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., a chief sponsor.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The bill is H.R. 1883.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 166.39; Nasdaq Up 7.68  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip stocks were tumbling today, pushing the Dow
industrial average briefly below 10,000, a drop of almost 15 percent from the
record set last month. Meanwhile, the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite
index shook off early losses and added to its gains from Wednesday's
record-shattering run.
</P>
<P>
	   At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 166.39 at
10,059.43, adding to Wednesday's 79-point drop. The Dow had dropped as low as
9,993.35 this morning.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time the Dow traded below 10,000 was Oct. 18, and its last close
below 10,000 was April 6, 1999, when it stood at 9,963.49. It reached a record
11,722.98 on Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one should underestimate the psychology of moving below 10,000," said
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. "When the Dow
dropping moves from the business page to the front page it will scare some
investors ... and could lead to more selling."
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq was up 7.68 at 4,554.62 after rising a record 168.21 points
Wednesday to 4,550.33, a new closing high. The Nasdaq had been down about 50
points earlier in the session due to profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 18.94 at 1,340.75.
</P>
<P>
	   Fears of higher interest rates once again were blamed for undercutting
stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is like 'Groundhog Day.' We know this story. We've seen it almost
every day," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries &AMP; Co. He
referred to the movie where the main character keeps living Groundhog Day over
and over again.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past week, policy-makers from the Federal Reserve have sent clear
messages that they intend to raise rates to cool off inflationary pressures in
the robust U.S. economy. Such moves could hurt corporate profits and slow
consumer buying.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks, which have become largely immune to concerns about rising
interest rates, have spent much of 2000 rallying at the expense of old-line blue
chip stocks, including retailers and banks. Investors are increasingly more
attracted by the younger high-tech firms' promise of higher profit gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Leading the Dow lower, was Wal-Mart, off 2 1/4 to 44 3/4, and Johnson &AMP;
Johnson, off 3 1/2 to 72 3/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2 to 1 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 525.8 million shares at midday, up from
Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.46 to 549.45.

<HEADLINE> WTO Rules Against U.S. Tax Breaks  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Billions of dollars in tax breaks for U.S. exports have
been ruled an illegal subsidy by the World Trade Organization, but the issue is
far from settled.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States believes a WTO panel was wrong in siding with the European
Union in the dispute, Rita Hayes, U.S. ambassador to the trade group, said
today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will seek a solution that ensures that American firms and workers are
not disadvantaged relative to their European counterparts,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky confirmed Wednesday that the
WTO panel had ruled the tax incentives, known as the Foreign Sales Corporation
program, are an illegal subsidy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We strongly disagree with the appellate body's ruling,'' Barshefsky said.
``Our view remains that the FSC is completely consistent with U.S.-WTO
obligations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the United States will not abandon
the program and will pursue negotiations intended to avoid retaliation from the
European Union, which brought the WTO challenge.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers, in an interview Wednesday with The Associated Press, said the
Clinton administration is ``clear in our commitment to finding a way to maintain
the important incentives for U.S. exports that have been provided in the past.
I'm sure we'll find a way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement today, Summers said he was disappointed with the WTO ruling
and insisted that Foreign Sales Corporations are ``widely viewed as creating a
level playing field with European tax systems and are important to our business
community.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will work closely with the Europeans, the business community and the
Congress to achieve a constructive solution,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton, meanwhile, told an audience of business executives today
that while ``nobody agrees with the WTO all the time'' it is important not to
let adverse decisions undermine support for the international trade body.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Having a system of rules ... is profoundly important,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Foreign Sales Corporation program enables U.S. makers of computer
software, chemicals, machinery and many other products to shield some export
income from taxes. The tax breaks for companies such as Microsoft, Boeing and
General Motors would be worth more than $15 billion over the next five years,
according to congressional estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Union puts the five-year price tag at $17.5 billion; the
administration estimates $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, welcomed the ruling. ``The FSC
system and its predecessor have had a major negative effect on international
trade to the detriment of European companies,'' he said in a statement from
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course we think that WTO members should be free to decide on their own
tax systems. But each member must do so fairly and in line with the rules,''
Lamy said
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional leaders are urging a negotiated deal, particularly because
changes in the law stemming from the WTO decision would be tricky, costly and
time-consuming. Also, opponents might seize the opportunity in an election year
to attack the program as corporate welfare.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are concerned that if this matter is not resolved bilaterally ... this
is likely to lead to a highly charged tax and trade environment that we are sure
all parties would like to avoid,'' lawmakers, including Sen. William Roth,
R-Del., and Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, said in a recent letter to the
administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The program was created in 1984 to offset tax rebates European companies get
when they sell products outside the EU. It permits U.S. companies to avoid
certain income taxes by setting up export subsidiaries on offshore tax havens
such as the U.S. Virgin Islands, Barbados and Guam.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies that enjoy this tax break fear the WTO decision could lead to
another trade war with the Europeans or require a major rewrite of the U.S. tax
code that would reduce the benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We stand to lose tax parity with our trading partners,'' said Steve
Elkins, the top tax official at the Chemical Manufacturers Association. ``And we
stand to be retaliated against through tariffs against U.S. exports.''
</P>
<P>
	   Martin Regalia, economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said an end to
the Foreign Sales Corporation program ``puts our companies at a comparative
disadvantage. We don't want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Europeans, on the other hand, contend the program has reached beyond its
original limits, particularly in 1997 when it was extended to U.S. computer
software-makers such as Microsoft.

<HEADLINE> Black Secret Service Agents Sue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of veteran black Secret Service agents, claiming
that a discriminatory ``glass ceiling'' retards or prevents the promotion of
blacks to senior management positions, sought relief today from the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   A complaint filed with the commission alleged that black agents, many of
whom have served on the details protecting President Clinton and Vice President
Al Gore, have suffered a pervasive pattern of discrimination involving
performance evaluations, transfers, assignments, training, promotions and ``a
racially hostile work environment.''
</P>
<P>
	   Secret Service spokesmen did not return telephone calls asking for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   John P. Relman, one of the lawyers representing the group, said at a news
conference there is no evidence that either Clinton or Gore ever had any
involvement with racial discrimination against the black agents who protect
their lives.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, he said, ``The stain of racial discrimination has found its way
into the shadow of the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We call for the direct intervention of the president or the vice president
to assure that these practices are investigated and are stopped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Relman and attorney David J. Shaffer said the plaintiffs were referred to
them by six black uniformed Secret Service officers who successfully sued
Denny's restaurants alleging discrimination against black customers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Secret Service has about 2,500 agents, including about 200 who are
black. Although several top Secret Service officials are black, the complaint
alleges that for many qualified agents are blocked from promotions.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- You're never too old to win your first Grammy. Just ask
'70s icons Cher, Barry White and Black Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
	   Youngsters like Britney Spears, Marc Anthony and the Backstreet Boys -- who
had some of 1999's best-selling albums -- will have to wait another year to grab

Sonny Bono.
</P>
<P>
	   White, the soulful love god known for the '70s hit "Can't Get Enough of Your

	   White, 55, triumphed over such younger competition as R. Kelly, Maxwell and
Tyrese in the R&AMP;B vocal category.
</P>
<P>
	   Black Sabbath, formerly fronted by Ozzy Osborne and known for such metal
classics "Paranoid," was honored for best metal performance with "Iron Man."
Drummer Bill Ward said it was gratifying to see artists from the Woodstock
generation, including the night's top winner, Carlos Santana, doing so well.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's totally cool," he said. "I didn't think that 31 years ago, I'd
be standing up in a suit. I feel more like an accountant than the guy who plays
drums in Black Sabbath."
</P>
<P>
	   Santana, the 52-year-old guitarist who shot to fame at Woodstock in 1969,
picked up eight Grammys, tying Michael Jackson's record for the most in one
night. Until this year, Santana had won only one minor Grammy.
</P>
<P>
	   Clive Davis, who helped launch the careers of Santana, Whitney Houston,
Sarah McLachlan and Bruce Springsteen, lauded Santana for his cross-generational
impact.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're an inspiration to every young musician throughout the globe because
when they break in they don't know how long a career can not only last, but how
long it can soar," said Davis, the longtime record company executive. "And to
those established musicians who've been No. 1, how to get back after years."
</P>
<P>
	   Country veterans George Jones and June Carter Cash, whose health travails
have received almost as much ink as their music in recent years, received their
first Grammys since 1970.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones, the 68-year-old who was nearly killed in a car wreck last year, won
male country vocal for "Choices."
</P>
<P>
	   Cash, the 70-year-old wife of Johnny Cash, picked up her third career Grammy
for "Press On" in the traditional folk album category.
</P>
<P>
	   Sting, who hadn't won in seven years, scored for male pop vocal with "Brand
New Day," beating out the likes of youngsters Marc Anthony and Ricky Martin.
Sting also won for pop album. He already had seven solo Grammys and his band
Police had won five.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Spears, Latin heartthrobs Martin and Anthony, R&AMP;B singer Brandy,
all-boy groups Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync and rapper Kid Rock were all shut
out.
</P>
<P>
	   But there was Christina Aguilera, the 19-year-old singer who earned her
first Grammy, for best new artist. She defeated fellow teen diva Spears, who
commanded greater attention for her sales and sex appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Aguilera said she hoped to follow in the footsteps of her idol, Mariah
Carey, who won best new artist in 1990. Carey sings, writes and produces much of
her own material.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want more writing credibility on the next album," Aguilera said. "It's
really wanting to be seen as a vocalist, because that's where my heart is and
trying to take pop a little bit deeper than it is now. I wish it wasn't just
about image."
</P>
<P>
	   One of the oldest timers of them all, Tony Bennett, now 73, took the Grammy
for traditional pop vocal for his tribute to Duke Ellington.

Grammys.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Dont't Reject China Trade  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today ``it would be a terrible
mistake'' to reject a trade deal with China even though he acknowledged that
Beijing poses a growing threat to Taiwan and has a poor record on human rights
and arms proliferation.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said that China's willingness to open its markets under a trade deal
with the United States is ``the kind of opportunity that comes along once in a
generation.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president spoke to members of the Business Council, a gathering of
executives of major American companies, to press the administration's campaign
for permanent trade benefits for China, part of an agreement to admit China into
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal faces formidable opposition in Congress -- and ran into more
trouble this week with China's escalation of threats against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most members of Congress do not question the economic benefit,'' the
president said. ``Critics are more likely to say things like this: `China is a
growing threat to Taiwan and other neighbors, we shouldn't strengthen it; China
is a drag on labor and environmental markets and rights and if we put them in
the WTO they will block further progress on those issues; or China is an
offender of human rights and we shouldn't reward it; or China is a dangerous
proliferator and we shouldn't empower it.'
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now all these concerns, I believe, are legitimate,'' Clinton said. ``The
question is whether they will be advanced or undermined by the decision Congress
will make, and America will make, on letting China into the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said the United States will ``continue to reject the use of force as
a means to resolve the Taiwan question. We'll also continue to make absolutely
clear that the issues between Beijing and Taiwan must be resolved peacefully and
with the assent of people of Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said the China vote was ``the most important question that Congress
will take up in the first half of this year.'' He said the United States has a
huge stake in how China evolves, and that expanding trade will expose China to
outside forces that would promote positive change.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that this agreement is vital to our national security,'' he
added.

<HEADLINE> 10th Kingdom Makes Time for Fantasy  </HEADLINE>
    By MATT WOLF Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- On a sound stage west of London, John Larroquette is battling
a troll.
</P>
<P>
	   Colleague Kimberly Williams, in the meantime, is battling the homesickness
that comes from having spent six days a week for six months filming a 10-hour TV
epic.
</P>
<P>
	   When it comes to TV, it's fair to say they don't make 'em like Hallmark
Entertainment's "The 10th Kingdom" anymore.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been a battle. Everyone's exhausted. I haven't been home," Williams
moans cheerfully to a reporter, much as an island castaway might be pleased to
encounter a stranger. The young American co-star of "Father of the Bride" and
the current "Simpatico" has spent the shoot in Europe, where filming traveled
from the Austrian Alps to eight sound stages and more than 150 sets at suburban
London's Pinewood Studios.
</P>
<P>
	   Boasting two directors (David Carson and Herbert Wise) because of its size
and costing $40 million, "The 10th Kingdom" starts Sunday at 9 p.m. EST on NBC.
The remaining four two-hour segments will be aired Monday (Feb. 28), next
Wednesday (March 1), and March 5 and 6.
</P>
<P>
	   Network TV hasn't seen anything on a comparable scale since ABC's "War and
Remembrance" more than a decade ago. In 1978, NBC aired "Centennial," which
lasted a hefty 26 hours.
</P>
<P>
	   But it takes time to work through an elaborate scenario that casts
Larroquette and Williams as ordinary father-and-daughter New Yorkers who are
transported via a magical doorway to the Land of the Nine Kingdoms. Their
odyssey brings them up against some familiar characters in unfamiliar guise --
Camryn Manheim's Snow White and Ann-Margret's Cinderella, among them.
</P>
<P>
	   In this alternative world, it seems, some beloved fairy tale characters
haven't disappeared; they've merely grown older or gone underground, alongside a
handsome prince-turned-dog (played by Daniel Lapaine) and a half-man half-wolf
suitor of sorts (Scott Cohen) for Williams' waitress, Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   Reminting herself, after a fashion, is two-time Oscar-winner Dianne Wiest.
The usually benign actress here makes a rare foray into flat-out villainy as an
evil queen.
</P>
<P>
	   "Someone said, 'You'll have the courage to do what you need to do,"' recalls
Williams of the relentless schedule, "and it's true. I feel like Virginia in a
lot of ways."
</P>
<P>
	   "I have this big, like, Greek-tragedy kind of confrontation with my mom,
trying to get her to see me and to mother me and to remember that she's my mom."
</P>
<P>
	   Without revealing the ending, Williams says "it's dark; it's dark."
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the time, "The 10th Kingdom" aims to be fun and tongue-in-cheek, not
least when Larroquette's Everyman-style janitor, Tony, ends up dueling
Blabberwort, Blue Bell and Burly -- three alliteratively named trolls.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're three big idiots, basically -- dangerous idiots, but that's where the
comedy comes from," says Jeremiah W. Birkett, the 35-year-old New Yorker cast as
the prosthetically challenged Blue Bell.
</P>
<P>
	   Out of costume, Birkett is lithe and wiry and amiable. In full troll garb,
he's trouble in bulked-up and toothsome form. "I look a lot more formidable than
I am," Birkett grins, then points to the set. "You can't have a little lanky
troll in there."
</P>
<P>
	   For executive producer Robert Halmi Sr., troll size is the least of his
concerns. Now 76, he is pondering a project that dwarfs even such past successes
as "Gulliver's Travels" in 1996, which won an Emmy for "The 10th Kingdom's"
English writer and co-producer, Simon Moore.
</P>
<P>
	   At four hours, that was a mere lark.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a Hungarian proverb that says 'the brave have all the luck,"' says
the Hungarian-born Halmi. "You don't just imitate other people. That's stupid."
</P>
<P>
	   Moore simply sounds happy to be getting onto the screen something he first
developed 11 years ago as a two-hour feature, and which has since mushroomed
into a "maxi-series."
</P>
<P>
	   "There are not that many chances in life to do something of this length,"
says Moore, 42, of the project he says "has the length and substance of a
novel."
</P>
<P>
	   "I wanted to write an adventure series where the two central characters were
completely ill-equipped to have an adventure," says Moore. He was prompted by
"the image of people lost in a forest that I kept coming back to when I reread
the fairy stories."
</P>
<P>
	   Moore cites a German antecedent for his work, at least as far as length is
concerned: the 1984 film "Heimat," which ran nearly 16 hours in length.

<HEADLINE> Senate Confirms 2 Federal Judges  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate confirmed two federal judges today, the latest
effort in ending a Republican block on all Clinton administration nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   By a 98-0 vote the Senate confirmed George B. Daniels as a district judge
for Southern New York and Kermit Bye as a judge of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   It was only the second time in as many weeks that Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., has allowed action on judicial nominations. Two other
nominations were confirmed earlier this month. At that time, Lott said the
Senate should not go all year without confirming any nominations, saying, ``Some
of these are good men and women.''
</P>
<P>
	   The nominations had been delayed because of a standoff between the Clinton
administration and Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans accused President Clinton of violating an agreement on making
temporary recess appointments, a method of bypassing the Senate confirmation
process.
</P>
<P>
	   To show their disapproval, Republicans put ``holds'' on all judicial
nominees. Under Senate tradition, a single senator can block further floor
action on a nominee as long as the majority leader agrees.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats have accused Republicans of playing politics by blocking worthy
judicial nominations. They also complained that nearly 10 percent of all federal
judgeships are vacant.
</P>
<P>
	   Bye, 62, a Fargo, N.D. lawyer, was nominated last April to fill a seat on
the 8th Circuit left vacant by the death of his friend and former law partner,
John D. Kelly. Kelly died last year a few days before his formal swearing-in
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
	   Daniels is a state Supreme Court justice from New York City.

<HEADLINE> FDA Warns Diabetics on China Herbs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration warned diabetics
Thursday not to use five brands of Chinese herbal products, saying the herbs
illegally contain prescription drugs that could cause dangerous drops in blood
sugar.
</P>
<P>
	   The products claim to contain only natural Chinese herbs.
</P>
<P>
	   But California health officials, investigating after a diabetic herb users
had several episodes of hypoglycemia, discovered the products also contain the
prescription diabetes drugs glyburide and phenformin.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumers can receive a dangerously high amount of the drugs from the
affected herbs, California's health department concluded -- and herb users
particularly are at risk if they also take regular diabetes medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   "People with diabetes should avoid these products and consult their
physician if they've been taking them," the FDA warned.
</P>
<P>
	   In particular, people who suffer fatigue, excessive hunger, profuse sweating
or numbness after taking the herbs should call a doctor.
</P>
<P>
	   Affected products are:
</P>
<P>
	   --Diabetes Hypoglucose Capsules, sold by Chinese Angel Health Products of
Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   --Pearl Hypoglycemic Capsules, imported by Sino American Health Products
Inc. of Torrance, Calif., but also sold by Chinese Angel.
</P>
<P>
	   --Tongyitang Diabetes Angel Pearl Hypoglycemic Capsules and Tongyitang
Diabetes Angel Hypoglycemic Capsules, sold by Sino American.
</P>
<P>
	   --Zhen Qi Capsules, sold by Sino American.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA has stopped imports of the products and is investigating how the
drugs were added to the herbs and whether any other herbal products are
contaminated.
</P>
<P>
	   Chinese Angel and Sino American have agreed to recall the affected products,
which may be returned to the place of purchase for a refund.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. Reviews Deutch Case  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department is reviewing former CIA Director
John Deutch's misuse of classified information on a home computer and how the
case was handled, Attorney General Janet Reno said today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The department is looking at the whole matter, reviewing the whole matter
to see whether there is any basis for further action,'' Reno told her weekly
news conference. She said the goal is ``to determine whether there is any action
that the Department of Justice should take.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee,
welcomed Reno's new attention to the case. But, he said, ``It's sad that she
didn't take a closer look at it earlier, because something is wrong and we're
going to try to get to the bottom of it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby's panel is conducting its own inquiry. Deutch testified earlier this
week and present and former CIA officials will be called to appear next week,
Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rules, if not laws, were obviously violated,'' Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate panel is not only looking into Deutch's conduct, but also into
how the investigation of Deutch was conducted by the current CIA director,
George Tenet, and other officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch apologized to the Senate committee for moving classified data to an
unprotected computer in his home that was occasionally connected to the
Internet. Now a private consultant, he was stripped of his CIA security
clearances as a result. The CIA inspector general also criticized top CIA
officials for not quickly referring the incident to the Justice Department for
possible criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   Last spring after a yearlong review of the 1996 episode, the Justice
Department's criminal division declined to prosecute Deutch for mishandling
classified information. The division found the lapses were sloppy rather than
nefarious and referred the case to the CIA inspector general for administrative
discipline.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno and her aides declined today to specify what questions were being
reviewed. They said only that the entire matter was under scrutiny when asked
whether the Deutch criminal investigation could be reopened or whether there was
any obstruction of justice of top CIA officials.
</P>
<P>
	   One Justice official, requesting anonymity, said two criminal division
lawyers are handling the review. The review is more comprehensive than the one
the Justice Department announced three weeks ago, this official said. At that
time, Justice lawyers were said to be taking a look at the CIA inspector
general's report, but, based on information then available, there were no plans
to reopen the Deutch investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice officials also said earlier this month that material in the
inspector general's report and emerging from congressional hearings into the
Deutch episode was already known to the criminal division when it declined to
prosecute last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., is
determined to proceed with his inquiry despite public and private apologies from
Deutch.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no excuse for this kind of behavior,'' Sen. Richard Shelby said
this week after Deutch appeared before his panel.
</P>
<P>
	   In his first public comments on his computer practices, Deutch told
reporters after Tuesday's closed-door session he erred in doing classified work
on unsecured home computers connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby said his panel will recall Deutch and wants to hear from present
senior CIA officials, including Director George Tenet, on why it took so long to
strip Deutch of his security clearances or to notify the Justice Department and
Congress that an investigation was under way.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch left the CIA in December 1996. Tenet had his predecessor's security
clearances removed last August. Deutch, a former deputy defense secretary, also
held onto a Pentagon security clearance but gave it up this month.
</P>
<P>
	   The CIA inspector general's report says Tenet ``should have involved himself
more forcefully to ensure a proper resolution of the matter.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, CIA spokesman Bill Harlow said Tenet considers Deutch's
mishandling of classified information ``inexcusable.'' The inspector general's
report ``paints a picture of individuals struggling with the challenge of
conducting a sensitive security investigation of the agency's former director.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We could have and should have done better,'' Harlow added.

<HEADLINE> Help-Wanted Ads Increased in Jan.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The volume of help-wanted advertising in major U.S.
newspapers rose in January, the Conference Board said in a report Thursday that
said chances are good that the unemployment rate would dip below 4 percent this
spring.
</P>
<P>
	   The business-financed research organization said its Help-Wanted Advertising
Index rose to 89 in January from 86 in November. It was 92 in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The index is used as a gauge of changes in job supply. It is watched by
economists as an indicator of labor market conditions to help form estimates of
unemployment rates.
</P>
<P>
	   "Employers are not cutting back on recruitment efforts, especially print
ads. Employment searches on the Internet are also continuing at strong levels,
although much of this activity is still difficult to measure accurately," said
Ken Goldstein, an economist for the Conference Board.
</P>
<P>
	   The relationship among job advertising, the layoff rate and employment
suggests the unemployment rate will soon fall below 4 percent, he said. The
unemployment rate was 4.0 percent in January, the lowest rate since the 3.9
percent recorded in January 1970.
</P>
<P>
	   The report Thursday said that from November through January, help-wanted
advertising rose in all parts of the country except the East South Central
region, which includes Birmingham, Ala.; Knoxville, Memphis and Nashville in
Tennessee; and Louisville, Ky., where it fell 4.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The greatest increase was in the Pacific region, including Los Angeles, San
Diego, San Francisco, Sacramento and San Bernardino in California; and Seattle,
up 7.8 percent. Other substantial increases were recorded in the South Atlantic
region, up 7.7 percent and including Atlanta; Baltimore; Charlotte, N.C.; Miami
and Jacksonville in Florida; Richmond, Va.; and Washington, D.C.; and the East
North Central region, up 5.5 percent and including Chicago; Cincinnati,
Cleveland, Columbus, Toledo and Dayton in Ohio; Detroit; Indianapolis and Gary
in Indiana; and Milwaukee.

<HEADLINE> Russia To Boost Oil Export Duties  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian government approved increasing the export duty on
crude oil by 33 percent to $20 per metric ton from $15, Deputy Prime Minister
Viktor Khristenko said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The higher export duty won't go into effect before April 15, Khristenko
said, according to Russian news agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   The government is also increasing the export duty on gasoil -- a type of
crude used for diesel engines and sometimes for heating -- to $15 per metric ton
from $10. The export duties on fuel oil and gasoline will remain unchanged at
$12 and $20 a ton, respectively.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Khristenko, government agencies will work out a procedure for
raising or decreasing oil and oil products' duties in line with price movements
on world markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian oil and natural gas producers account for about one-third of the
country's tax revenues.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 233.00; Nasdaq Off 4.84  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip stocks dropped sharply today, pushing the Dow
Jones industrial average below 10,000, while the technology-dominated Nasdaq
composite index dipped lower as it paused following Wednesday's
record-shattering run.
</P>
<P>
	   At midafternoon on Wall Street, the Dow was down 233.00 at 9,992.73, adding
to Wednesday's 79-point drop.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time the Dow traded below 10,000 was Oct. 18, and its last close
below 10,000 was April 6, 1999, when it stood at 9,963.49. It reached a record
11,722.98 on Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one should underestimate the psychology of moving below 10,000," said
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. "When the Dow
dropping moves from the business page to the front page it will scare some
investors ... and could lead to more selling."
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq was down 4.84 at 4,554.62 after rising a record 168.21 points
Wednesday to 4,550.33, a new closing high. The Nasdaq had been down about 50
points earlier in the session due to profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 23.33 at 1,337.36.
</P>
<P>
	   Fears of higher interest rates once again were blamed for undercutting
stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is like 'Groundhog Day.' We know this story. We've seen it almost
every day," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries &AMP; Co. He
referred to the movie where the main character keeps living Groundhog Day over
and over again.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past week, policymakers from the Federal Reserve have sent clear
messages that they intend to raise rates to cool off inflationary pressures in
the robust U.S. economy. Such moves could hurt corporate profits and slow
consumer buying.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks, which have become largely immune to concerns about rising
interest rates, have spent much of 2000 rallying at the expense of old-line blue
chip stocks, including retailers and banks. Investors are increasingly more
attracted by the younger high-tech firms' promise of higher profit gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart, off 2 1/4 to 44 3/4, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, off 2 3/4 to 73 3/8,
led the Dow lower. In all, 27 of the 30 Dow stocks were down.
</P>
<P>
	   Powering the Nasdaq were Intel, up 5 to 113 5/8 and fiber optics maker JDS
Uniphase, up 14 3/8 to 250 1/8. But the telecommunications firm Qualcomm was
down 9 3/8 to 137 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2 to 1 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 753.5 million shares at midday, up from
Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index was up 1.26 at 551.17.

<HEADLINE> Tribal Leaders Seek Budget Increase  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT KELLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's proposal to provide $1.2 billion more
for Indian health care, law enforcement and education is not enough to meet the
dire needs of reservation communities, tribal leaders and their allies in
Congress say.
</P>
<P>
	   Indian programs have been underfunded for so long that more money is needed
to bring them up to minimal standards, the leaders said Thursday at a meeting of
the National Congress of American Indians.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's proposal to boost spending on Indian programs to $9.4
billion, more than a 12 percent increase over the current year's level, ``does
not begin to address the Third World conditions on our reservations,'' Congress
President Susan Masten said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is only the first step to recognize the trust obligations and treaty
responsibilities to Indian Nations,'' said Masten.
</P>
<P>
	   Lynn Cutler, the top White House aide on Indian issues, and other
administration officials acknowledge the budget proposal won't meet all tribes'
needs, but say a larger increase might have trouble in the GOP-controlled
Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's still not enough to meet basic needs, but it's a good package to go
around,'' White House adviser Mary Smith, a Cherokee, told the tribal leaders
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said he would
welcome proposals for additional spending.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A billion dollars is nothing to laugh at, it's pretty good,'' Domenici
said Wednesday during a Senate Indian Affairs Committee hearing. ``But it may be
that somebody might want to put more (money) in, especially in school
construction.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's budget proposal for the nation's 2.4 million Indians includes $300
million for reservation school construction and renovation, more than double the
$133 million to be spent this year. The money would pay for six new schools,
mostly in Arizona and New Mexico, but would not erase an estimated $800 million
backlog in vital repairs and construction for Indian schools.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget also calls for $140 million in new spending on Indian law
enforcement, more than $60 million more for building and repairing reservation
homes and nearly $230 million more for the Indian Health Service.

<HEADLINE> Black Secret Service Agents Sue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of veteran black Secret Service agents, claiming
that a discriminatory ``glass ceiling'' retards or prevents the promotion of
blacks to senior management positions, asked the government for relief today.
</P>
<P>
	   A complaint filed with the equal-opportunity office of the Secret Service
alleged that black agents, many of whom have served on the details protecting
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, have suffered a pervasive pattern
of discrimination involving performance evaluations, transfers, assignments,
training, promotions and ``a racially hostile work environment.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the agents made clear they are prepared to sue in federal court
if their demands for better treatment for black agents are not satisfied by the
Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
	   Secret Service spokesmen did not return telephone calls asking for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   John P. Relman, one of the lawyers representing the group, said at a news
conference there is no evidence that either Clinton or Gore ever had any
involvement with racial discrimination against the black agents who protect
their lives.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, he said, ``The stain of racial discrimination has found its way
into the shadow of the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We call for the direct intervention of the president or the vice president
to assure that these practices are investigated and are stopped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Relman and attorney David J. Shaffer said the plaintiffs were referred to
them by six black uniformed Secret Service officers who successfully sued
Denny's restaurants alleging discrimination against black customers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Secret Service has about 2,500 agents, including about 200 who are
black. Although several top Secret Service officials are black, the complaint
alleges that for many qualified agents are blocked from promotions.

<HEADLINE> Brain Injury Vaccine Tested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- An oral vaccine that protects brain neurons from injury
caused by epilepsy seizure or by stroke has been tested successfully in rats,
researchers report.
</P>
<P>
	   In a study to be published Friday in the journal Science, researchers at the
medical school of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia report that a
vaccine given to rats caused their immune system to develop antibodies that
prevented the action of a protein that causes damage after brain injury.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Matthew During, professor of neurosurgery at Jefferson and lead author
of the study, said the vaccine works against a brain protein, called the NMDA
receptor, that has been shown to aggravate brain damage after a stroke and to
play a role in epileptic seizures.
</P>
<P>
	   Other researchers have tried to block the action of the NMDA receptor using
drugs, but these drugs often fail to effectively cross the blood-brain barrier,
a natural barrier that protects the brain from most destructive substances in
the blood.
</P>
<P>
	   By using a vaccine, the researchers prompt the body, in effect, to make its
own NMDA blocker by creating antibodies that neutralize the protein after brain
injury.
</P>
<P>
	   In the study, some rats were immunized with the anti-NMDA antibody while
others were not. A month later, the rats were injected with a neurotoxin,
kainate, which causes seizures similar to those in epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the control rats, which were not immunized, there was a seizure rate
of 70 percent. Among those with the anti-NMDA antibody, the seizure rate was 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In another study, immunized and nonimmunized rats were tested after five
months for protection from stroke damage. An artificial stroke was induced in
the animals using a drug.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the immunized rats, said During, "We found dramatic protection in the
rats' brains. ... It doesn't stop the stroke from occurring, but the amount of
brain damage is diminished by 70 percent."
</P>
<P>
	   None of the studied rats showed abnormal behavior from the vaccine, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The study has been conducted only in rats, and During said a vaccine may
cause unknown effects that are not reversible.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are continuing to look at long-term effects," the authors said in the
Science study. "These experiments and additional safety studies need to be
investigated before any translation of this technology to the clinic."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Foreign Cops Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed a directive Thursday for a $10
million U.S. program to train foreign police forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, in a statement, said ``in peacekeeping missions from the Balkans to
East Timor, establishing basic law and order has been among the most important
-- and formidable -- challenges.''
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department is setting up an office for the program. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said it would improve U.S. capacity to provide police
overseas in coordination with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Such help can be essential in enabling people who are emerging from a
conflict to feel that their rights will be protected,'' Albright said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright said trained civilian police are needed in the province of Kosovo
in Serbia, East Timor and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The international community needs to identify and train units that are
able to control crowds, deter vigilante actions, prevent looting and disarm
civilian agitators,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Halts Strike at Union Pacific  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order
Thursday on a union strike at Union Pacific Railroad just hours after it hit
selected points across the Midwest and West.
</P>
<P>
	   The railroad argued the strike over the closing of a facility in Wyoming was
illegal. Arguments were set for Monday in U.S. District Court in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike by the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way began at 6 a.m., Union
Pacific spokesman Mark Davis said. Omaha District Judge Joseph Bataillon signed
the restraining order four hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   "Within the next few hours operations will return to normal with minimum
train delays across the area," Davis said.
</P>
<P>
	   The shop in Laramie, Wyo., employs 37 people and makes 40-foot section of
track for construction and repairs, Davis said. Union Pacific wants to close the
shop to buy such track from another source and save overhead on the plant.
</P>
<P>
	   Workers at the shop would have the opportunity to find work at the railroad,
Davis said, but not in Laramie.
</P>
<P>
	   Union spokesman Dave Tanner said the railroad acted unilaterally to close
the shop and threatened the workers' livelihood.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike was at locations along original Union Pacific rail lines,
including all sites in Nebraska, most track in Kansas and some locations in
Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Idaho, north into the Pacific Northwest and southwest
to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   About 4,080 people belong to the union across the railroad's system. Davis
said he did not know how many employees were directly affected by the strike.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-E.U. Deal on Tax Breaks Urged  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to avoid a new trade war with Europe, U.S.
corporations and members of Congress urged the Clinton administration Thursday
to negotiate a quick solution to a World Trade Organization decision that
outlaws billions of dollars in U.S. export tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has until Oct. 1 to comply with the WTO decision that its
Foreign Sales Corporation program is an illegal trade subsidy as claimed by the
European Union. After that date, the EU could retaliate with higher tariffs or
other trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Congress could change tax laws to comply, few people familiar with
the case believe there's enough time in an election year to accomplish such a
costly and delicate task on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is very difficult to do anything legislatively in a presidential
year,'' said Kimberly Pinter, corporate finance and tax director at the National
Association of Manufacturers. ``As soon as you engage 535 additional people, it
makes the issue much more complicated than it would be at the negotiated
level.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Foreign Sales Corporation program, created in 1984, allows about 6,000
U.S. companies including Boeing, General Motors, United Technologies and
Microsoft to reduce income taxes by 15 percent by creating export subsidiaries
in tax havens such as the Virgin Islands and Barbados. Its intent is to offset
an EU tax rebate given to its companies for goods sold overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration estimates the value of the U.S. tax break at $4.1
billion in fiscal 2001; the Europeans peg the subsidy at $17.5 billion over five
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though the decision marks the biggest U.S. trade loss ever at the WTO,
no immediate impact is expected on U.S. companies or the economy. But if the
program were to disappear, company officials say the United States could lose a
competitive edge that would eventually result in higher prices, fewer jobs and
lower profits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This decision drops a brick onto one end of the well-balanced scale that
has governed global trade for nearly two decades,'' said Ruth Harkin, lobbyist
for United Technologies. ``It gives European exporters a huge leg up to enjoy
large tax exemptions unavailable to U.S. and other companies.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Europeans, of course, take a different view. Pascal Lemy, the European
Commission's trade commissioner, said the Foreign Sales Corporation program
creates ``a major negative effect'' on international trade by unfairly assisting
in some $250 billion in U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think that WTO members should be free to decide their own tax systems.
But each member must do so fairly and in line with the rules,'' Lemy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Like much of corporate America, key members of Congress urged President
Clinton to negotiate a settlement with the EU. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa,
said the issue should be a top priority at the Group of Eight economic summit
meeting this June in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
	   There were also concerns Thursday that the decision could undermine support
for the WTO in Congress. In remarks to a group of business leaders, Clinton said
``nobody agrees with the WTO all the time'' but that ``having a system of rules
is nonetheless profoundly important.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``What's the alternative?'' added Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
``To go back to the bad old days of building walls and not having communication
and trading partnerships we have around the world? We need that framework.''
</P>
<P>
	   Top Clinton administration officials expressed disappointment and
disagreement with the WTO ruling, but said they would seek a ``constructive
solution'' with the EU within the trade body's decision. They noted that the
U.S. has won 23 of 25 WTO cases and is involved with the EU in disputes
involving bananas, beef growth hormones and aerospace.

<HEADLINE> Putin Promises Talks With Chechens  </HEADLINE>
   By YURI BAGROV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MESKER-YURT, Russia (AP) -- Looking toward the end of the war in Chechnya,
acting President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said negotiations could be held with
some Chechen factions and indicated the republic could have some autonomy within
Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin's statement came as the Russian military claimed that a large
concentration of rebels had been forced to disperse under intense air and ground
assaults in Chechnya's southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops have captured dominant heights around the town of Shatoi, the
separatist fighters' last major command post, the military said.
</P>
<P>
	   The core of the rebel force in Shatoi has broken up into small groups, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported, citing military sources. Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said 70 to 80 militants were killed around Shatoi since Wednesday,
while two Russian servicemen were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Military commanders said earlier in the week that some 2,700 militants were
concentrated near Shatoi, a town 28 miles south of the Chechen capital, Grozny,
that sits in the Argun Gorge, which cuts through the mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   The claim that the core force had disintegrated could not be independently
confirmed and even in small groups, the rebels -- adept at guerrilla attacks --
can inflict much harm on the numerically superior Russian forces. But the loss
of strategically positioned Shatoi could seriously weaken the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Massive air and artillery bombardment of Shatoi continued Thursday. Federal
warplanes and helicopter gunships flew more than 120 combat missions since
Wednesday, the army said.
</P>
<P>
	   Military officers said their commanders were not planning a quick storming
of Shatoi and would go on with the heavy barrage for a while -- the tactics used
by Russians to seize Grozny earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin told St. Petersburg's Radio Baltica that there were ``forces in
Chechnya with whom it's possible to hold negotiations'' but did not specify what
forces he meant. The Kremlin, however, backs a group called the Chechen State
Council that was formed in Moscow last fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the five-month war, Putin has consistently refused to consider
negotiating with the rebels and his statement Thursday was not an apparent
change in policy.
</P>
<P>
	   But, coming one day after a statement expressing regret for Chechens'
suffering under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, when they were deported en masse,
his comments could be seen as aiming at easing animosities if Russia wipes out
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Chechens, human rights groups and Western governments have repeatedly lashed
out at Russia's tactics in Chechnya, saying the shelling and bombing have killed
civilians indiscriminately.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nobody wants to enslave the Chechen people, push them into a corner and
present them as a defeated people,'' Putin said Thursday. ``There are many ways
and means of resolving problems connected with autonomy, and they will be
found.''
</P>
<P>
	   There were no details on how much autonomy Russia would be willing to allow
in Chechnya. The republic has had de-facto independence since rebels fought
Russian forces to a standstill in the 1994-96 war; since then it has been
essentially ungovernable, plagued by flourishing crime -- especially ransom
kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia planned to reopen border crossings between Chechnya and the republic
of Ingushetia on Friday, the news agency Interfax cited Ingush Interior Minister
Khazmat Gutseriyev as saying. The crossings were closed on Tuesday because
Russian officials said they were concerned about terrorist actions reportedly
planned for Wednesday, the day when Chechens commemorated the 1944 deportation.
</P>
<P>
	   Following weeks of airstrikes, Russia sent troops into Chechnya in late
September to fight rebels whom it blamed for apartment bombings that killed some
300 people in Russia. The bombings came after Chechnya-based fighters invaded
the neighboring republic of Dagestan in August and were driven out by Russian
forces.

<HEADLINE> Stage Is Set for Latin Grammys  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Such a "Smooth" segue.
</P>
<P>
	   Big Grammy wins by Carlos Santana and Christina Aguilera provide a
high-profile lead-in for a Latin Grammys show that debuts next fall.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mexican-born Santana won eight Grammys on Wednesday, tying Michael
Jackson's record for most awards in one night. Aguilera, whose father is from
Ecuador and who plans to release a Spanish-language album this spring, was a
surprise winner for best new artist.
</P>
<P>
	   The success of Santana and Aguilera and the high visibility of Hispanics
throughout the ceremony emphasize the growing popularity of Latin performers and
music -- and so September's Latin Grammys will honor performers, producers and
other music professionals recording in Spanish and Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
	   "Demographic trends show Latinos eventually will be the largest ethnic
minority in the U.S.," said Ricardo Dopico, director of Latin music for the
Recording Industry Association of America. "As a result of those sheer numbers,
the Latin culture is going to continue to seep into mainstream culture."
</P>
<P>
	   Ricky Martin's performance at last year's Grammys helped kick the Latin
sensation's career into high gear. Martin and fellow Latin singer Marc Anthony
had nominations in top pop categories at Wednesday's Grammy show, which included
a Latin musical segment featuring numbers in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
	   Latino awards presenters included Gloria Estefan, Jimmy Smits, Andy Garcia
and Jennifer Lopez, perhaps the evening's most-talked-about celebrity with a
gown cut in a loose V that left little to the imagination.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Latino and non-Latino Grammy winners and performers, including
guitarists B.B. King and George Benson, praised Santana, whose commercial
comeback "Supernatural" put the guitar impresario on top of the album charts for
the first time in almost 30 years. It won album of the year honors, while
"Smooth" -- Santana's first-ever No. 1 single -- won record and song of the
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Ruben Blades, who won the Grammy for Latin pop performance for "Tiempos,"
said he grew up listening to such mainstream acts as Frankie Lymon and the
Teenagers, but Santana broke ground for Latin artists because he was "hailed
worldwide and was respected and treated as an equal by his peers."
</P>
<P>
	   "His success inspired a lot of people," Blades said.
</P>
<P>
	   Latin bandleader Tito Puente, who won a Grammy for traditional tropical
Latin performance, joked that he has profited off the talent of Santana, whose
early hits include Puente's "Oye Como Va."
</P>
<P>
	   "Everytime he plays 'Oye Como Va,' I get a nice royalty check," Puente said.

	   Dow Down 255.96; Nasdaq Off 45.45
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip stocks dropped sharply today, pushing
the Dow Jones industrial average below 10,000, while the
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index dipped lower after
yesterday's record-shattering run. Just before 3 p.m. EST the Dow

4,504.88 after rising a record 168.21 points Wednesday to 4,550.33,
a new closing high. The Nasdaq had been down about 50 points

	   Durable Goods Orders Fall in Jan.
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Slackening demand for airplanes and
electronics caused orders for big-ticket goods to dip last month,
but the fall isn't a big setback for U.S. manufacturers, which
continue to possess a lot of momentum, economists said. Orders to
U.S. factories for durable goods -- items expected to last at least
three years -- slipped 1.3 percent in January to a seasonally
adjusted $214.8 billion, the Commerce Department said today. Even
with the decline, overall durable-goods orders last month were
still 6.5 percent higher than January 1999. ``The real story is
that American manufacturing interests are sustaining the momentum
of a freight train going full bore,'' said KeyCorp economist Ken
Mayland.

automaker first appealed an order to recall cars manufactured from

was the only nation that wanted to enter the single currency bloc

single currency group, has been the cornerstone of Socialist

<HEADLINE> Clemency Reform Bill Passed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Concerned about the process used to offer clemency to 16
Puerto Rican nationalists, a Senate committee approved a bill Thursday that
gives victims more input.
</P>
<P>
	   The Judiciary Committee passed the Pardon Attorney Reform and Integrity Act
by a voice vote. A companion measure sponsored by Rep. Vito Fosella, R-N.Y., is
pending in the House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Its aims are simple: To make sure future presidents will have available to
them relevant facts when weighing decisions involving executive clemency, and to
notify victims of important events in the process,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, the committee's chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure requires the U.S. Pardon Attorney to solicit input from crime
victims and to keep them apprised of key events in the clemency process. It
would also mandate that law enforcement agencies be notified when a clemency
procedure was initiated and would seek their input as well.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill does not affect the president's ability to exercise pardon power,
Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think future presidents will appreciate the reforms this bill will bring
... and so will victims and the American public in general,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation grew out of a controversy last August when President Clinton
offered clemency to 16 Puerto Rican separatists affiliated with the FALN, or
Armed Forces of National Liberation, the group held responsible for a wave of
bombings in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Fourteen accepted the offer, which
was conditioned on the prisoners renouncing violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Victims of the bombings complained they were left out of the clemency
process even as advocates of the Puerto Rican prisoners attended meetings with
high-level administration officials.

<HEADLINE> Senate Targets Russian Aid to Iran  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Following suit with the House, the Senate on Thursday
voted unanimously to step up efforts to stop Russia and other countries from
supplying Iran with weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters said the bill was necessary despite the ascendance of reformers
in the Tehran government. ``Fresh breezes of change are blowing through Iran,''
said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. But he said those changes have not reached
the highest levels of government ``who unfortunately have made Iran a pariah
state.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 98-0 Senate vote followed a 419-0 House vote last September on a
slightly different version. The House is expected to adopt the Senate bill and
send it to the president.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House threatened to veto the House bill, saying it complicated
international nonproliferation efforts, but congressional sources said the
administration was satisfied with changes in the Senate bill giving the
president more flexibility in imposing sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation, unlike a previous bill that President Clinton did veto in
1998, does not require the president to impose sanctions against Russia and
others that supply missiles or weapons to Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   It directs the president to submit reports to Congress every six months
identifying foreign persons or countries that transfer weapons material or
technology to Iran and authorizes him to impose sanctions if he so chooses.
</P>
<P>
	   It does make payments to the Russian space agency in conjunction with work
on the International Space Station contingent upon the president's concluding
that Russia is complying with nonproliferation policies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This sends a clear message to Russia that they must do more'' to stop the
flow of weapons and nuclear technology to Iran, said Senate Majority Trent Lott,
R-Miss., a chief sponsor of the bill with Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
	   Lieberman said the bill was also a message to the administration that
``relations with Russia are not more important than our national security.''
</P>
<P>
	   Russia has actively assisted Iran in its nuclear power program, which the
United States fears is being used to cover up secret efforts to build nuclear
weapons, and China and North Korea have helped Iran produce ballistic missiles
now thought to have a range of at least 800 miles.
</P>
<P>
	   After the 1998 veto, the administration moved on its own to announce
sanctions on seven Russian entities suspected of transferring weapons technology
to Iran. In 1999 three more Russian groups were added to the list.
</P>
<P>
	   But Lott said this had not done enough to stop the flow of weapons
technology. He said that with enactment of the bill, ``we hope the
administration will use it to our country's advantage and impose sanctions.''

<HEADLINE> Religious Leaders Meet in Nigeria  </HEADLINE>
   By TIM SULLIVAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KADUNA, Nigeria (AP) -- Christian and Muslim leaders promised Thursday to
work together to restore peace in the troubled city of Kaduna, as residents
trickled back into the debris-strewn streets after two days of religious clashes
left at least 200 people dead.
</P>
<P>
	   Schools and most stores remained closed, but hawkers were back in the
streets where police and soldiers maintained a heavy presence.
</P>
<P>
	   Fighting erupted Monday morning during a demonstration by local Christians
against a proposal to bring Islamic law, or sharia, to Kaduna state. By
Wednesday, an uneasy calm had been restored to Kaduna, one of the largest cities
in northern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
	   Guns, cutlasses and other weapons were used, said workers at the morgue at
the city's main hospital. An overwhelming stench filled the building at the
Ahmadu Bello Teaching Hospital where about 200 mostly charred bodies were piled
up on slabs, on the floor, even the ground outside. More corpses were being
brought in Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   As life started to return to normal in the streets, state authorities eased
the 20-hour curfew to between 4 p.m. and 7 a.m. and set up a panel to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between religious leaders started Wednesday and continued into
Thursday to work out ways to contain the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is already a commitment on the part of leaders of Christians and
Muslims to work together to promote peace and religious tolerance in our
community,'' said Saidu Dogo, secretary of the local Christian Association of
Nigeria branch. ``We are still talking, and that is very important.''
</P>
<P>
	   Not all the violence was motivated by religion, said a prominent local
Muslim religious leader.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a lot of unemployed youth all over the place and they are ready to
cash in on situations like this and make trouble,'' Sheik Lawal Abubakar said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police, who initially reported that just 13 bodies had been recovered, said
Thursday they were still trying to determine the total number killed. Police
gave no injury toll, but hospital staff said they treated 400 people.
</P>
<P>
	   Sporadic violence continued in outlying areas and in the neighboring towns
of Kafanchan and Zaria. A deacon at the Nasana Baptist Church was among several
people killed Wednesday in Zaria, the Lagos newspaper Punch reported Thursday.
At night, sporadic gunfire echoed through the slums on Kaduna's outskirts,
residents said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe staying here another night would be too dangerous,'' said Sunday
Isibor, who was among several hundred at the main checkpoint on the road leading
to the capital, Abuja, hoping to find transportation out of town Thursday. ``I
am very terrified.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sharia has become an increasing flashpoint for tension in Nigeria, a nation
of 120 million sharply divided along ethnic, religious and geographic lines. The
divisions regularly flare into bloody battles.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, sharia officially went into affect in neighboring Zamfara state,
which is overwhelmingly Muslim. Niger state, south of Kaduna, and Sokoto state,
to the northwest, passed their own sharia bills this week.
</P>
<P>
	   A number of other states in Nigeria's largely Muslim north -- including
Kaduna, which is about 40 percent Christian -- are talking about following suit.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharia supporters across the North have assured non-Muslims they will not be
tried under Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
	   Such assurances have meant little to Christians, who fear becoming
marginalized or discriminated against. Their fears are fed by the country's
newspapers in the largely Christian south, which have filled pages with dire
warnings of the punishments Christians will face.
</P>
<P>
	   Muslim law prohibits such things as drinking alcohol and also calls for
separate schools and public transportation for men and women. Islamic courts
have been established to hold trials and mete out punishment to Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   Recently, one man was lashed 80 times in Zamfara state for drinking alcohol.
</P>
<P>
	   Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, elected a year ago after 15 years of
military rule, has remained largely silent about sharia, but condemned the
violence as ``not only criminal but highly unpatriotic.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we need most now is love, caring for each other and joining of hands
to rebuild the nation together,'' Obasanjo said on national television
Wednesday. ``Let us bind our wounds and accept the challenge of the time.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 129.07; Nasdaq Down 0.60  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP)-- Blue chip stocks dropped sharply today on interest rate
fears, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average briefly below 10,000. But the
index regained ground late in the session as investors moved in to pick up
bargains.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index was barely changed following
Wednesday's record-shattering run.
</P>
<P>
	   In late afternoon on Wall Street, the Dow was down 129.07 at 10,096.66,
adding to Wednesday's 79-point drop. In earlier trading the Dow fell as low as
9,944.02.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time the Dow traded below 10,000 was Oct. 18, and its last close
below 10,000 was April 6, 1999, when it stood at 9,963.49. It reached a record
11,722.98 on Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one should underestimate the psychology of moving below 10,000," said
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. "When the Dow
dropping moves from the business page to the front page it will scare some
investors ... and could lead to more selling."
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq was down 0.60 at 4,549.73 after rising a record 168.21 points
Wednesday to 4,550.33, a new closing high. The Nasdaq had been down about 50
points earlier in the session because of profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 19.64 at 1,341.05.
</P>
<P>
	   Fears of higher interest rates once again were blamed for undercutting Blue
Chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is like 'Groundhog Day.' We know this story. We've seen it almost
every day," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries &AMP; Co. He
referred to the movie where the main character keeps living Groundhog Day over
and over again.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past week, policymakers from the Federal Reserve have sent clear
messages that they intend to raise rates to cool off inflationary pressures in
the robust U.S. economy. Such moves could hurt corporate profits and slow
consumer buying.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks, which have become largely immune to concerns about rising
interest rates, have spent much of 2000 rallying at the expense of old-line blue
chip stocks, including retailers and banks. Investors are increasingly more
attracted by the younger high-tech firms' promise of higher profit gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart, off 2 1/4 to 44 3/4, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, off 2 3/4 to 73 3/8,
led the Dow lower. In all, 27 of the 30 Dow stocks were down.
</P>
<P>
	   Powering the Nasdaq were Intel, up 5 to 113 5/8 and fiber optics maker JDS
Uniphase, up 14 3/8 to 250 1/8. But the telecommunications firm Qualcomm was
down 9 3/8 to 137 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2 to 1 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 906.3 million shares at midday, way up from
Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.80 at 549.11.

<HEADLINE> J.C. Penney To Close 45 Stores  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID KOENIG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PLANO, Texas (AP) -- J.C. Penney Co. Inc. plans to close about 45 department
stores and 289 Eckerd drug stores in an effort to turn the troubled retailer
around.
</P>
<P>
	   Company officials said Thursday most of the closures will occur by midyear,
but they declined to say which of its 1,150 department stores and 2,900 Eckerds
will close or how many jobs will be lost.
</P>
<P>
	   The Plano-based store and catalog retailer also announced that it lost $12
million in the quarter ended Jan. 29. The 8-cents-per-share loss compared with a
gain of $207 million, or 77 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Before one-time charges, including store-closing costs, per-share profit
fell nearly 40 percent, to 45 cents a share from 72 cents a year earlier.
Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected 47 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, Penney's stores have been battered by competition from
aggressive rivals such as Kohl's department stores and discount chains such as
Gap Inc.'s Old Navy.
</P>
<P>
	   Penney's stock has lost about three-quarters of its value in the past nine
months. In trading Thursday, shares of Penney were down 68 3/4 cents to $16.18
3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Penney said it will take a charge of about $530 million to close the
department stores and the weakest members of the Eckerd chain. The moves will
save up to $300 million a year, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Half a billion in restructuring is juicy, but I think it could have been
bigger," said Richard Church, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. "They've got
a number of underperforming stores that frankly needed to be purged."
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts had expected dramatic moves from new senior executives who have
joined Penney in the past few months, and they predicted that more changes are
in the works.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, the company announced a campaign to spruce up its stores and
centralize its merchandise ordering.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a long uphill climb. They face a difficult retail environment, and the
economy is probably going to create some headwind for them," Church said.
</P>
<P>
	   "They deteriorated over a decade, so it's not going to be an overnight fix,"
said Jeffery Edelman, an analyst with PaineWebber, who called the closings
"overdue."
</P>
<P>
	   Although the company remained tightlipped about which stores will close -- a
spokeswoman said they hadn't been selected -- chief executive James E.
Oesterreicher said the doomed department stores had $350 million in sales last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Almost all of these stores are operating at a loss," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 289 Eckerds to close are mostly small, low-volume stores that Penney
bought from other chains, Oesterreicher said. Selling or closing them will cost
the company $450 million in sales this year and $550 million next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In its earnings report, Penney said revenue rose 5.2 percent to $9.8 billion
from about $9.4 billion a year earlier. But, as the company had previously said,
weak holiday sales forced dramatic price-slashing that reduced profit in the
fourth quarter. Comparable-department store sales fell 1.4 percent and catalog
sales fell 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year ended Jan. 29, Penney said its net income was $336 million, or
$1.16 a share, down 43 percent from $594 million, or $2.19 a share the year
before.
</P>
<P>
	   Oesterreicher also said the company will proceed in the third quarter with
its delayed plans to sell 20 percent of the Eckerd chain to the public in a
tracking stock.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to avoid a new trade war with Europe, U.S.
corporations and members of Congress urged the Clinton administration Thursday
to negotiate a quick solution to a World Trade Organization decision that
outlaws billions of dollars in U.S. export tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has until Oct. 1 to comply with the WTO decision that its
Foreign Sales Corporation program is an illegal trade subsidy as claimed by the
European Union. After that date, the EU could retaliate with higher tariffs or
other trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Congress could change tax laws to comply, few people familiar with
the case believe there's enough time in an election year to accomplish such a
costly and delicate task on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is very difficult to do anything legislatively in a presidential
year,'' said Kimberly Pinter, corporate finance and tax director at the National
Association of Manufacturers. ``As soon as you engage 535 additional people, it
makes the issue much more complicated than it would be at the negotiated
level.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Foreign Sales Corporation program, created in 1984, allows about 6,000
U.S. companies including Boeing, General Motors, United Technologies and
Microsoft to reduce income taxes by 15 percent by creating export subsidiaries
in tax havens such as the Virgin Islands and Barbados. Its intent is to offset
an EU tax rebate given to its companies for goods sold overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration estimates the value of the U.S. tax break at $4.1
billion in fiscal 2001; the Europeans peg the subsidy at $17.5 billion over five
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though the decision marks the biggest U.S. trade loss ever at the WTO,
no immediate impact is expected on U.S. companies or the economy. But if the
program were to disappear, company officials say the United States could lose a
competitive edge that would eventually result in higher prices, fewer jobs and
lower profits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This decision drops a brick onto one end of the well-balanced scale that
has governed global trade for nearly two decades,'' said Ruth Harkin, head of
United Technologies' office in Washington. ``It gives European exporters a huge
leg up to enjoy large tax exemptions unavailable to U.S. and other companies.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Europeans, of course, take a different view. Pascal Lemy, the European
Commission's trade commissioner, said the Foreign Sales Corporation program
creates ``a major negative effect'' on international trade by unfairly assisting
in some $250 billion in U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think that WTO members should be free to decide their own tax systems.
But each member must do so fairly and in line with the rules,'' Lemy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Like much of corporate America, key members of Congress urged President
Clinton to negotiate a settlement with the EU. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa,
said the issue should be a top priority at the Group of Eight economic summit
meeting this June in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
	   There were also concerns Thursday that the decision could undermine support
for the WTO in Congress. In remarks to a group of business leaders, Clinton said
``nobody agrees with the WTO all the time'' but that ``having a system of rules
is nonetheless profoundly important.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``What's the alternative?'' added Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
``To go back to the bad old days of building walls and not having communication
and trading partnerships we have around the world? We need that framework.''
</P>
<P>
	   Top Clinton administration officials expressed disappointment and
disagreement with the WTO ruling, but said they would seek a ``constructive
solution'' with the EU within the trade body's decision. They noted that the
U.S. has won 23 of 25 WTO cases and is involved with the EU in disputes
involving bananas, beef growth hormones and aerospace.

    CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean prices rebounded Thursday after a big selloff the
previous day on the Chicago Board of Trade, pulling grains higher with them.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans initially headed lower for a second straight day, falling further
beneath the $5-a-bushel level. But they wound up 1 percent higher, helped back
up by rumors China was buying U.S. and South American soybeans
</P>

<HEADLINE> Group Finds Candles Containing Lead  </HEADLINE>
    By CARL HARTMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Couples who light candles for a romantic dinner -- or
because the power goes out -- could put enough lead into the air to endanger
small children, said a study released Thursday by a consumer advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
	   Of 285 candles bought in the Washington area, 86 were stiffened with metal
and nine of those used high amounts of lead, the Public Citizen study said. Most
of the candles came from China or Taiwan and one came from Canada, reported Dr.
Sidney M. Wolfe, director of the organization's health research group.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. candle makers agreed in 1974 to stop using lead under a voluntary
accord with the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which investigated lead in
candles and found no specific health risk.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year the commission began another investigation, spokesman Russ Rader
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't know that there is any kind of health hazard associated with
leaded candles," he said. "Anytime we get reports of lead involving consumer
products it's a concern of ours."
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfe said the candles tested released lead amounts that exceeded what the
commission says is dangerous for kids under six years of age -- taking in more
than 15 micrograms -- 15 millionths of a gram -- in a day.
</P>
<P>
	   "In roughly 20 minutes walking or toddling or crawling into the room with
any of these candles burning, when it's at the peak concentration...would cause
more than 15 micrograms to be ingested," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Public Citizen study concluded that when the lead-wick candles burn for
three hours they can produce average air lead concentrations ranging from nine
to 33 times higher than recommended by federal guidelines.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Candle Association, which represents American manufacturers and
distributors, said the majority of wicks manufactured in the United States are
made with 100 percent cotton and no metal core. Those with metal are typically
made with zinc.
</P>
<P>
	   To test for lead, consumers can take the metal core of an unused candle and
rub it on paper. A lead wick will leave a mark like a pencil; zinc and tin wicks
will not.
</P>
<P>
	   The candle association said the United States manufactured 375 million
pounds of candles in 1998 and imported 30 million pounds, most of those from
China.

<HEADLINE> Spanish King Reminds US of Its Roots  </HEADLINE>
   By PAULINE JELINEK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- King Juan Carlos of Spain used the launching of an
Internet history project Thursday to say America doesn't appreciate its Hispanic
roots.
</P>
<P>
	   But the ``ever-growing'' U.S. Hispanic community, he said, will one day make
sure it does.
</P>
<P>
	   With the click of a mouse, the king kicked off a bilingual project by the
National Library of Spain and U.S. Library of Congress to share historic
materials on the settling of America.
</P>
<P>
	   And with a quote from President John Kennedy, he said Spain's contribution
to that effort is sometimes forgotten.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unfortunately, too many Americans think that America was discovered in
1620, when the pilgrims came,'' the king said, speaking in Spanish quoting a
1961 Kennedy speech -- ``and they forget the immense adventure of the 16th
century ... in the South and Southwestern part of the United States'' -- once
part of the old Spanish Empire.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking at the Library of Congress on the last day of his and Queen Sofia's
three-day visit to the U.S., the king said he hoped the project would bring
about ``a new awareness of Spain's historic role in creating and forming the
personality of the American nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement calls for the two institutions to create a ``virtual
electronic library'' of rare material on history and culture of both countries.
A site on the World Wide Web will include digital copies of books, manuscripts,
maps and other materials.
</P>
<P>
	   The king posted the first item on the as yet unfinished site, a copy of a
1562 map of the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
	   The first permanent settlement in what is now U.S. territory was St.
Augustine, Fla., founded in 1565 by Spaniard Pedro Menendez de Aviles.
</P>
<P>
	   The king said the growing Hispanic community in the United States ``will
ensure that the enormous colonizing task undertaken by its ancestors ... is
given due recognition by fellow Americans.''

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein: All Parties Must Disarm  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sinn Fein leader Martin McGuinness said Thursday any
successful disarmament in Northern Ireland must include all parties to the
conflict, including Unionists who, he contended, have 150,000 weapons at their
disposal.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuinness expressed irritation at a news conference that the Irish
Republican Army is often cited as the cause of recent setbacks to the peace
process because it had not begun turning in its weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the 1998 Good Friday Accords, which established the basis for peace
in the province, assert that it is the ``collective responsibility'' of all
participants to work cooperatively to achieve decommissioning, or disarmament.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People think that the only guns that are causing problems are the guns of
the IRA,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We in Sinn Fein also have concerns about guns,'' he said, referring to the
weapons held by the Unionists and the British troops deployed in the province.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuinness served as education secretary of the local government in Northern
Ireland that was suspended by the British government two weeks ago because of
the disarmament issue.
</P>
<P>
	   The government, which featured participation by the main Protestant parties
and Sinn Fein, lasted just eight weeks before it was dissolved by the British
government.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuinness, who serves as deputy to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, is here to
rally support from the White House and Irish-American leaders. Also here are
David Trimble, the Protestant Unionist leader, and Peter Mandelson, the British
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   The dissolution of the local government has left McGuinness alarmed about
the future prospects for the peace process. In his appearance, he used such
phrases as ``deep crisis,'' ``dire straits, and ``huge gulf of mistrust'' to
described the situation.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Sinn Fein is ``absolutely committed to making the peace process
work,'' and he cast doubt about the willingness of Unionists to meet Sinn Fein
half way.
</P>
<P>
	   As an example, he said, ``Trimble has never been prepared to shake hands
with Gerry Adams.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also said Mandelson bears much of the responsibility for the setbacks
though his decision to dissolve the local government despite Sinn Fein's
``having brought forth a new and significant proposal.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``What the British have done is totally and absolutely illegal,'' McGuinness
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Trimble, in an appearance Wednesday at Harvard's Kennedy School, defended
the decision to suspend home rule and expressed confidence that the two sides
will find a way to restore a Northern Ireland free of violence.

<HEADLINE> Train With Pets Ready To Roll  </HEADLINE>
   By CLAR NI CHONGHAILE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARIS (AP) -- Continental cats and dogs can at last look forward to taking
the train to chase pigeons in London's Trafalgar Square, without that blissful
image being tarnished by the thought of six lonely months in a quarantine
kennel.
</P>
<P>
	   For a modest $46, they can now travel with their owners on the Eurotunnel
train under the English Channel, thanks to the British government's lifting of
its stringent 100-year-old quarantine laws last year. The move allows pets --
cats and dogs only -- from 21 Western Europe nations to enter Britain without
spending six months in quarantine.
</P>
<P>
	   The first train carrying four-legged tourists will leave Calais, in northern
France, on Monday morning, Eurotunnel said in a statement on Thursday. The trip,
which costs human passengers $330 to $550 per car, lasts 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the easiest way to travel with pets because you don't have to leave
them alone, and have them freak out on sea for example,'' said Eurotunnel
spokesman Jeremy Close.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An awful lot of people have reserved. It makes sense because a lot of
British people have second homes in France or want to come back with their
animals,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The rule change is also a relief for British dogs, who will no longer have
to spend long summer months in France dreading quarantine exile on their return
home.
</P>
<P>
	   But free-spirited continental pets hoping for a last-minute weekend break,
beware! The trip requires preparation.
</P>
<P>
	   Dogs and cats, like other travelers, need their own special passports -- but
theirs are signed and stamped by a veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
	   To get the passport, they must have a chip implanted to verify their
identity and must have had both a rabies vaccination and blood tests a month
afterward to prove it worked. They also must have been treated for ticks and
tapeworm 24 to 48 hours before arrival.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain's Passports for Pets plan was announced last March, and officials
believe that when fully operational 300,000 pets could be on the move each year.
The program is likely to be extended to the United States, Canada and the
Caribbean in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   But dogs and cats taking the train will have to be on their best behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   There will be no gamboling around the train, looking for other pioneer pet
travelers. The animals must remain in their owners' vehicles during the journey.
Small dogs and cats will be confined to cages. Dogs must travel with a collar
and leash. Toilets will be provided.
</P>
<P>
	   And for pet lovers worried about how their animals will react to high-speed
travel, Eurotunnel offers advice on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   It recommends against tranquilizers because of the unpredictable nature of a
pet's reaction. And for a perfect journey, it suggests feeding pets a light meal
two hours before the trip.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Gets Aid After Flooding  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   XAI-XAI, Mozambique (AP) -- With many roads and bridges washed out, an air
relief operation accelerated Thursday for victims of flooding that has killed 70
in Mozambique and submerged much of the country in muddy water.
</P>
<P>
	   Rainstorms, meanwhile, persisted in neighboring areas of southern Africa,
exacting a deadly toll.
</P>
<P>
	   In South Africa's Northern Province, 10 people have died since Wednesday
night when their water-soaked houses collapsed, and two others drowned when they
were swept away by fast-running rivers.
</P>
<P>
	   In Zimbabwe, torrential rain forced 250,000 people to evacuate their homes.
Five people have died. Others marooned by floodwaters had to fend off venomous
snakes that also fled to high ground.
</P>
<P>
	   Record levels of rainfall began drenching southern Africa at the beginning
of February. Cyclone Eline, which surged ashore Tuesday with heavy rains and
winds howling at more than 100 miles an hour, added to the misery.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, a French C160 military cargo plane ferried loads of aid to
outlying depots in Mozambique for further distribution to victims by
helicopters. Two private helicopters from South Africa arrived Thursday in
Mozambique's capital of Maputo to assist five South African Air Force
helicopters with food drops.
</P>
<P>
	   The helicopters also have plucked more than 3,000 people from rising
floodwaters, including from trees and rooftops.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the air operation began, 270 tons of food and medical supplies have
been delivered, said South African Air Force Maj. Louis Kirsten.
</P>
<P>
	   From the air, it appeared an inland sea had settled over much of Mozambique,
with water punctuated by the tops of trees, islands of high-lying ground and the
roofs of huts.
</P>
<P>
	   In the low-lying countryside there was virtually no sign of life. Most
people had left for higher ground.
</P>
<P>
	   The area surrounding Xai-Xai, a town about 125 miles north of Maputo, was
hit hard when the nearby Limpopo River overflowed. Residents tried Thursday to
extract their cars from the muck.
</P>
<P>
	   The World Health Organization warned that more than 800,000 Mozambicans are
at risk from epidemics -- particularly cholera and malaria -- because of the
flooding.
</P>
<P>
	   Mozambique's government and the United Nations have appealed for
international aid. Portugal, Mozambique's colonial ruler until 1975, responded
with a donation of $2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said the flooding in Mozambique left more than 200,000 people
homeless and more than 300,000 needing food aid. The storms knocked out power
supplies and washed away scores of roads and bridges.
</P>
<P>
	   Rogerio Manguete, an official with the Mozambican disaster management
services, said the economy had been set back by years.
</P>
<P>
	   Zimbabwe's government appealed for tents, clothing, blankets, water
purification aids, and food to supplement distribution of its own strategic corn
reserves.

<HEADLINE> Health Center Funding Boost Urged  </HEADLINE>
   By LIBBY QUAID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal funds for health care clinics that annually treat
millions uninsured Americans would grow by more than $2.7 billion over five
years under an effort announced Thursday by a bipartisan group of senators.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawmakers are pressing to double funds for community health centers,
whose providers treat 11 million people each year, more than one-third of whom
lack health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters held a Capitol Hill news conference to announce the effort, which
they say has a much better chance of passage in this election year than broader
health care proposals being pushed in Congress and on the presidential campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It specifically targets the people and communities with the largest health
care access problems,'' said Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo. and a bill sponsor.
``And it takes advantage of successful private organizations instead of relying
on a government takeover of health care.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C. and another sponsor, said the program saves
money: ``It costs four times as much for regular treatment and five to six times
as much in the emergency room,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The centers deliver primary care and preventive treatment to patients in
hundreds of under-served urban and rural areas nationwide. Among those patients
is Denise Hall, a single mother of two from Washington, D.C., who does not have
health insurance for herself or her youngest son. She goes to the Bethlehem
Health Center, part of Washington's Unity Health Care, for help.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even when I have no money to pay for treatment, they will see me
regardless of my ability to pay or my insurance status,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond and Hollings have nine co-sponsors, including Sens. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah; Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.; and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.

<HEADLINE> Black Secret Service Agents Sue  </HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Secret Service blocks many black agents, including
those who guard the president, from promotion to senior management positions,
three black agents alleged in a discrimination complaint filed Thursday with the
agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The agents -- all of whom have worked on details protecting President
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore -- cite a pattern of discrimination involving
performance evaluations, assignments, training, promotions, transfers and ``a
racially hostile work environment.''
</P>
<P>
	   They are seeking an official agency finding that their rights have been
violated and an order barring the Secret Service from any form of
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   The Secret Service, which has about 200 black agents among its 2,500-member
force, did not return repeated phone calls Thursday, although the White House
referred all questions about the matter to the agency. Lawyers said they hope
most of the 200 black agents eventually will join the complaint.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency's equal opportunity office is handling the complaint and will
make the initial assessment of it. Elements of it could eventually be considered
by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a federal lawsuit could be
filed if the complaints are not first resolved by negotiation or administrative
action.
</P>
<P>
	   Although some top Secret Service officials are black, the complaint alleges
many black agents who also are qualified are effectively blocked from
advancement into the agency's top jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   John P. Relman, one of the agents' lawyers, said at a news conference there
is no evidence either Clinton or Gore were involved in the alleged
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We call for the direct intervention of the president or the vice president
to assure that these practices are investigated and are stopped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   One agent, Reginald G. Moore, said that after being assigned to a lead
position in the president's protective detail, he was denied a promotion,
directed to train the white agent promoted ahead of him, and then transferred to
the Secret Service field office in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	   Added Yvette Summerour, now a member of the president's protective detail
who has also helped guard first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Chelsea Clinton:
``I wonder why I can't break through. I always get near the top, and then I
can't get anywhere else.''

<HEADLINE> France To Publish Holocaust Textbook  </HEADLINE>
   By MARILYN AUGUST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARIS (AP) -- For the first time, French high school students soon will have
a special textbook about the Holocaust -- with graphic photos of Nazi barbarism
and France's role in the persecution and extermination of Jews.
</P>
<P>
	   The Holocaust hardly figured in French textbooks until the late 1980s. When
it did, the Vichy government's collaboration with the Nazis was glossed over --
a sign of France's reluctance to face one of the darkest chapters in its recent
history.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, the Holocaust has been studied as a subchapter of World War II,
coming at the end of the school year and often neglected.
</P>
<P>
	   At an international symposium on the Holocaust last month in Stockholm,
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said a translation of the English-language
``Tell Ye Your Children,'' would soon become available to French students.
</P>
<P>
	   French Nazi hunter and historian Serge Klarsfeld has written a preface to
the book in which he describes Vichy's collaboration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm very pleased to see that the book will be widely distributed in French
schools,'' Klarsfeld said in an interview, confirming the decision to publish
the book -- which went unnoticed in France.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is important for European children to have access to the same body of
information about the Holocaust,'' he said. ``It can be the foundation for a
harmonious political reaction to a man like Austria's Joerg Haider, a man who
defends the policies of the Third Reich.''
</P>
<P>
	   Millions of copies of the book already are used in schools in Sweden,
Germany and Norway. Finland and Russia plan to publish it as well.
</P>
<P>
	   For years, Klarsfeld has fought to set the record straight about the Vichy
regime's role in deporting Jews from France.
</P>
<P>
	   Vichy passed laws banning Jews from many professions, owning property and
businesses. The laws -- often more repressive than similar measures in Nazi
Germany -- led to the confiscation of all Jewish personal property.
</P>
<P>
	   About 76,000 Jews were deported from France to Nazi death camps, including
about 12,000 children. Only about 2,500 people survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Publisher Jean-Claude Gawsewitch said the book will be available to
sixth-graders but is geared to older students because of the graphic nature of
the photos.
</P>
<P>
	   The photos include the French identity papers of Anny-Yolande Horowitz, a
9-year-old, described as ``a foreigner to be watched.'' She died at Auschwitz in
1942 along with her younger sister and mother.
</P>
<P>
	   Another photo shows five handicapped men in striped concentration camp
pajamas used by Nazi doctors in pseudo-medical experiments.
</P>
<P>
	   Nicole Sergent, a history teacher and member of France's National Teachers'
Union, said the Holocaust already is widely taught.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The new book is an interesting initiative which provides teachers an
additional teaching tool, but frankly, it's not a revolution,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Students learn about the Holocaust even before their sophomore year of
high school, and teachers are already developing notions of tolerance and
anti-racism.''

<HEADLINE> Worker Walkouts Hit Low in 1999  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of major strikes by American workers hit a
record low of 17 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year's big labor disputes idled about 73,000 workers for an average of
16 days each, the Labor Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency's Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping a count since 1947
of strikes involving 1,000 or more workers and lasting at least one shift. The
previous record low of 29 strikes was set in 1997. In 1998, there were 34
walkouts involving 387,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Of last year's strikes, 12 were in the private sector and the rest involved
teachers and other education workers employed by state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest strikes involved 12,000 workers at casinos in Atlantic City,
N.J., and 11,000 teachers each in Detroit and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
	   The longest was at Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in
Virginia, where 8,000 employees represented by the United Steelworkers struck
for 117 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Strike activity by unions has generally been declining since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
	   Union membership has decreased during most of that period, and companies'
successes at replacing striking workers has caused unions to resort to other
tactics, including publicity campaigns targeted at consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said the booming economy also was a factor
last year. "Unionized workers are benefitting from our historic expansion and
enjoying real wage gains," she said.

<HEADLINE> Argentina President Faces Tough Test  </HEADLINE>
   By CAMILLA GALLAGHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- New President Fernando de la Rua faced one
of his toughest political tests to date Thursday as Argentina's lower house took
up a controversial labor reform bill amid a noisy Buenos Aires street protest.
</P>
<P>
	   The 2 1/2-month-old administration won over mainline labor unions with its
proposals to revamp labor laws many see as too rigid. But dissenting truckers
and other workers went ahead with a protest anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   A crowd the Interior Ministry estimated at 18,000 people massed in the
capital, beating drums, setting off firecrackers and waving colorful union
banners.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Rua officials said they were not worried by the afternoon
demonstration. Many of the 3,000 uniformed officers watched the traffic-snarling
protest from behind mesh barricades, but did not intervene.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd find it difficult to believe that the labor reform will be thwarted,''
said Economy Minister Jose Luis Machinea. He predicted victory for the labor
proposal, which is intended to stir job growth and increase competition in the
labor market.
</P>
<P>
	   With Argentina beset by a recession and a jobless rate of 13.8 percent, the
president has worked to cut a troublesome fiscal deficit and has passed
unpopular new tax proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   The government's proposed labor bill calls for a host of changes, including
extending the probationary period of new hires and lowering employer-paid
payroll contributions for new workers. With such measures, the government
intends to boost wage flexibility and promote the creation of steady jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   International observers -- including the International Monetary Fund, which
holds the key to a $7.4 billion standby loan for Argentina -- believe the
proposed reforms would improve Argentina's labor market. Union critics claim,
however, that the measures will hurt workers without boosting the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodolfo Daer, the head of the Confederacion General de Trabajo, Argentina's
main union federation, scrapped plans for a demonstration Thursday. But Daer's
sudden decision caused a split within the federation. Hugo Moyano, the head of
the truckers union, seized the CGT headquarters Wednesday and led hard-liners
during Thursday's work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
	   During the protest, Moyano raised his fist on a podium packed with union
dissenters and shouted down the reform package. Confetti flew and drums banged
as scores of union banners fluttered on tall poles. Police watched silently amid
the horn-honking chaos.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a direct provocation against working people,'' Moyano said of the
reform package, which he called a move to chip away at worker protections. The
crowd roared back its approval.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal's fate in the lower house represents a major test for the
president. If endorsed, the measure would go on to the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Marriott, Investors Reach Agreement  </HEADLINE>
    By KELLEY SHANNON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Thousands of investors suing Marriott over limited
partnerships formed in the 1980s have reached a tentative settlement under which
the hotel giant would buy back 120 Courtyard by Marriott inns for $372 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement, revealed in court Thursday, also calls for Marriott
International Inc. and Host Marriott Corp. each to pay $31 million to end
lawsuits involving certain limited partnerships aside from the Courtyard by
Marriott deals.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for both sides characterized the deal as a "win-win" situation
providing liquidity for investors and value in the form of hotels for Marriott.
It still must receive the formal approval of investors and the court.
</P>
<P>
	   Settling the case with these terms is preferable to a prolonged court fight,
said Arne Sorenson, executive vice president and chief financial officer of
Marriott International.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's old news," Sorenson said. "We're talking about something that happened
in the mid- to late '80s. We're glad to bring it to a close."
</P>
<P>
	   Lead plaintiffs' attorney David Berg estimated the number of affected
investors to be about 6,000 in six different limited partnerships.
</P>
<P>
	   "The sense I get is the clients are thrilled to have liquidity," Berg said.
"I'm thrilled with the settlement, and I think Marriott is and I hope it gets
done."
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement will result in a one-time, pre-tax charge of $30 million to
$40 million to Marriott International, Sorenson said, adding that after that
period it should have no impact on earnings per share. Host Marriott said it
would take a charge of between $40 million and $50 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of both companies were down in trading on the New York Stock Exchange
Thursday, with Host Marriott off 18 3/4 cents to $8.93 3/4 and Marriott
International down $2.31 1/4 to $27.37 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   Word of the tentative deal arrived just as attorneys were on the verge of
going to trial in one of the limited partnership disputes. Investors accused
Marriott of fraud and claimed the hospitality company sold hotel properties for
inflated prices, charged excessive management fees and presented inflated profit
projections.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement calls for Marriott International and Host Marriott, through
an unconsolidated joint venture, to acquire the Courtyard by Marriott I and
Courtyard by Marriott II limited partnerships for $372 million. The two limited
partnerships own 120 hotels, which are managed by Marriott.
</P>
<P>
	   The transaction would end those limited partnerships.
</P>
<P>
	   The two Marriott companies also would pay a combined $62 million to settle
limited partnership lawsuits involving two Residence Inn limited partnerships
and Fairfield Inn and Desert Springs limited partnerships.
</P>
<P>
	   "The settlement is a complicated business transaction that involves the
repurchase of 120 hotels from two limited partnerships relating to Courtyard for
significant amounts of money," Richard Hoffman, an attorney for Marriott
International. "But it's the repurchase of assets by the company, it's not just
a payment of money to the plaintiffs to settle a fraud claim."
</P>
<P>
	   The repurchase of the Courtyard by Marriott inns will mean a profit for the
investors, Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Each investor in the Courtyard by Marriott I Limited Partnership who put an
initial $100,000 into the deal would receive about $135,000 after the hotels are
sold and the partnership ends. That is above any distributions the investors
received over the life of the partnership.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Courtyard by Marriott II Limited Partnership, each $100,000
investment will see $147,000 after the hotel sale, above and beyond any previous
distributions.
</P>
<P>
	   The estimated amounts are subject to slight changes as details of the
settlement are worked out, attorneys said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. OKs Troop Commitment for Congo  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Half a year after six nations and three rebel groups
signed a cease-fire on Congo, the U.N. Security Council on Thursday authorized a
5,500-strong observer force to monitor its implementation and lay the groundwork
for possible deployment of a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   The former combatants are already pressing for the United Nations to send
peacekeepers, but the Security Council first wants the opposing sides to honor
the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The 15-member council unanimously agreed to the U.S.-drafted resolution to
send 500 military observers, supported by 5,037 security troops and logistics
personnel. The group will verify that all parties are observing last summer's
cease-fire aimed at ending a 1 1/2-year war in Congo that has destabilized
central Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke has said the United States will not
provide troops but may provide logistical support.
</P>
<P>
	   Many council members recognize that sending such a small mission to a
country a quarter the size of the United States with few roads and poor
communications may not be militarily effective but can be politically important.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Security Council has taken a critical step to help the Congo come to a
peace that its people so desperately need,'' said Holbrooke, who devoted his
presidency of the council last month to African issues. ``The time has now
arrived to act.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Congo observer mission, expected to cost around $500 million for the
first 12 months, is the fourth major U.N. peacekeeping operation approved by the
Security Council in eight months. It had already agreed to send 4,800 civilian
police to Kosovo, 11,100 peacekeepers to Sierra Leone, and 10,800 peacekeepers
and civilian police to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   The war in Congo has been called Africa's first world war. Russia's U.N.
ambassador, Sergey Lavrov, on Thursday described it as ``the largest conflict in
modern Africa.'' It has not ended despite the cease-fire agreement -- a point
reiterated by speaker after speaker.
</P>
<P>
	   Congo is backed by Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia. The rebels who took up arms
to oust President Laurent Kabila from power in August 1998 are supported by
Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
	   As recently as Wednesday, at a one-day summit in Lusaka, Zambia, the key
players renewed their commitment to implement the cease-fire quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   But Britain's Deputy Ambassador Stewart Eldon told the council ``the
situation on the ground does not look promising.'' He warned that increasing
ethnic tensions in the Kivu region in rebel-held eastern Congo threatened the
entire population and risked ``a humanitarian catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fighting must stop now,'' he said. ``International humanitarian law
must be respected.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under the resolution, deployment would be in phases and subject to
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's determination that the troops are safely able to
do their jobs. A senior U.N. official said the first observers could be deployed
within three weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Possible troop contributors include Pakistan, Jordan, Senegal and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
	   Lavrov underscored the council's general agreement that the United Nations
will not take measures to force the parties to a peace, or to force guerrillas
to disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation in Congo is so complicated, he said, ``that it would not only
be naive but dangerous to rely on its settlement by external forces.''
</P>
<P>
	   Participants at the Lusaka summit welcomed the expected deployment of U.N.
observers and urged the Security Council to quickly deploy peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   But the draft resolution gives no timetable for even considering a
peacekeeping force, saying only that Annan should make recommendations for
further deployment based on progress in implementing the cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke stressed that support for the U.N. observer mission did not
constitute ``prior approval'' for a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   Namibia's U.N. ambassador, Martin Andjaba, noting that it took the council
almost four months to adopt the resolution, called for speedy deployment of the
military observers and expressed hope that peacekeepers would soon follow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Over the years, the U.N. has brought peace to so many countries including
my own,'' Andjaba said. ``Expectations of the suffering masses in the (Congo)
for peace in their country are therefore high and rightly so. We should not let
them down.''

<HEADLINE> Experts Debate Popular Diet Plans  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Want to lose weight? Try following the back and forth of
the Great Nutrition Debate, a government-sponsored face-off Thursday of
America's leading diet gurus. The exercise was guaranteed to leave you
exhausted.
</P>
<P>
	   At one end was cardiologist Robert Atkins, promoter of the wildly popular,
high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet that lets people eat omelets, bacon and
bun-less burgers. "It's easy to follow. You're never hungry," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other: Dean Ornish, an internist whose book promises readers they can
"Eat More, Weigh Less" if they follow his ultra low-fat, virtually vegetarian
diet.
</P>
<P>
	   In between were people like heart surgeon Morrison Bethea, co-author of
"Sugar Busters! Cut Sugar to Trim Fat," who says the secret to losing weight is
cutting out not just sugar but also foods like potatoes and carrots that act in
similar ways.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, biochemist Barry Evans, who believes the answer to obesity is in
chemistry -- controlling the body's insulin level, and internist John McDougall,
who thinks it should be obvious to anyone that an Asian rice-based diet is best.
"This is a no brainer," he said .
</P>
<P>
	   Atkins vigorously defended his low-carb diet, which has been roundly
criticized by Ornish as well as many medical experts who fear it could damage
the kidneys or bones.
</P>
<P>
	   Atkins said that it is the fat and cholesterol produced by the body that is
the culprit in obesity, not the fat that's eaten. And not only does his diet
work, it's safe, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Not so, said Ornish.
</P>
<P>
	   "Telling people that pork rinds and sausage is healthy sells books, but it's
hazardous to your health," said Ornish.
</P>
<P>
	   In the sharpest exchange of the debate, Ornish criticized the lack of
research done on the effects of Atkins' diet.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not as good a fund-raiser as you are," Atkins snapped.
</P>
<P>
	   "With the number of books you sell you could fund your own studies," Ornish
fired back.
</P>
<P>
	   As for critics who say Ornish's low-fat diet is unappealing, he said that's
because they are not cooking the right way.
</P>
<P>
	   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who organized the debate and had the
final word, made no effort to sort out the myriad of conflicting claims.
</P>
<P>
	   "Eat well and eat healthy," he advised. But he suggested that it may be time
for government researchers get involved in evaluating the various diets.
</P>
<P>
	   There were some areas of agreement among the weight-loss experts: Americans
are too fat. Exercise is good. Added sugars and refined carbohydrates, like
white bread, are not.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond that, they couldn't agree on what causes people to become fat, much
less how to get rid of it.
</P>
<P>
	   "Balance is the key," said Keith-Thomas Ayoob, a spokesman for the American
Dietetic Association and a panelist for the debate. "We've gone to all the
extremes now. Maybe somewhere in between is where we need to go."
</P>
<P>
	   Diets can reduce weight, but the question is whether people can keep it off,
said Ayoob, a nutritionist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. "Big
changes are temporary changes."
</P>
<P>
	   One diet is not "appropriate ... for each and every patient," said another
panelist, Denise Bruner, president of the American Society of Bariatric
Physicans, the doctors who treat obesity. "Does a physician treat every stomach
ache with a pill?"

partnerships own 120 hotels, which are managed by Marriott.
</P>
<P>
	   The transaction would end those limited partnerships.
</P>
<P>
	   The two Marriott companies also would pay a combined $62 million to settle
limited partnership lawsuits involving two Residence Inn limited partnerships
and Fairfield Inn and Desert Springs limited partnerships.
</P>
<P>
	   "The settlement is a complicated business transaction that involves the
repurchase of 120 hotels from two limited partnerships relating to Courtyard for
significant amounts of money," Richard Hoffman, an attorney for Marriott
International. "But it's the repurchase of assets by the company, it's not just
a payment of money to the plaintiffs to settle a fraud claim."
</P>
<P>
	   The repurchase of the Courtyard by Marriott inns will mean a profit for the
investors, Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Each investor in the Courtyard by Marriott I Limited Partnership who put an
initial $100,000 into the deal in the late 1980s would receive about $135,000
after the hotels are sold and the partnership ends. That is above the $78,000 in
distributions the investors received over the life of the partnership.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Courtyard by Marriott II Limited Partnership, each $100,000
investment will see $147,000 after the hotel sale. Investors had already
received $72,000 in previous distributions.
</P>
<P>
	   The estimated amounts are subject to slight changes as details of the
settlement are worked out, attorneys said.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Nations OK Oil Production Hike  </HEADLINE>
   By TAREK AL-ISSAWI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Persian Gulf oil ministers have agreed
to increase production of crude to stabilize prices around the world, but have
not decided how much -- leaving it unclear whether consumers will find relief at
the gas pumps.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior United Arab Emirates oil official said Thursday that Gulf Arab oil
ministers who met the day before in Saudi Arabia agreed to a production
increase. Such a move could bring down oil prices, which have been hovering near
a nine-year high.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Figures were discussed and more discussions will be held before a specific
figure is agreed upon,'' the official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The official said a production increase will be gradual and will be in the
range of 1.5 million barrels a day, or 6 percent above current levels.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After that, it's the market's call,'' he said, refusing to speculate to
what extent that would bring prices down from the $30 a barrel where they have
been hovering.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Gulf officials cited different figures, but all those who met
Wednesday in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, agreed a production increase is needed.
Some officials said the ministers now favor an increase of between 2 million and
2.5 million barrels per day -- about 8 to 10 percent -- to reach a price of
between $20 and $25 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Not all oil-producing nations agree, however. Kuwait has championed the
cause of maintaining current production cuts beyond their scheduled expiration
on March 31. And Iran, the second-largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, has come out against a rise in output.
</P>
<P>
	   Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheik Saud Al Sabah declined to say Thursday if Kuwait
had agreed to increase its production, saying the question would be decided at
OPEC's meeting in late March.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil analyst James A. Placke, director of Middle East research at Cambridge
Energy Research Associates, said the market would welcome a production increase.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An increase is appropriate and indeed necessary,'' Placke said. ``If there
is no adjustment, there will be a supply shortage, beyond what we've seen.''
</P>
<P>
	   It is difficult to peg specific increases in output to falls in oil price
because prices depend on many factors, including market perceptions and the
behavior of countries like Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts have said an increase of at least 2 million barrels a day is
needed to stabilize markets and make a sufficient impact on stocks of oil. A
smaller increase could actually raise prices because it may be seen as an
indication that producers are not serious about stabilizing prices. Gasoline
prices in the United States are averaging about $1.41 per gallon, about five
cents shy of the all-time peak of $1.46 in November 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past two weeks, some oil producers within and outside OPEC, such as
Mexico, have called for OPEC to increase production beyond the current 22.976
million barrels a day set by an agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   At a Gulf meeting last year, OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and
the United Arab Emirates and non-OPEC members Oman and Bahrain agreed to cut
production to raise prices. Oil was then at its lowest prices in decades, but
the cutback helped drive the price to its current high level.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who arrived in Kuwait on Thursday and
flies to Saudi Arabia on Friday, said Washington does not want to manipulate
markets or dictate prices.
</P>
<P>
	   While a price of $10 a barrel was ``much too low,'' $30 a barrel is too
high, Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we want to see is stability in the oil market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Crude oil for April delivery gained 53 cents to $29.92 per barrel on the New
York Mercantile Exchange Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Off 133.41; Nasdaq Up 66.91  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP)-- Blue-chip stocks fell sharply today on persistent interest
rate fears, sending the Dow Jones industrial average briefly below 10,000. The
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index, which fluctuated throughout the day
reached a new closing high for the second day in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   At the close of regular trading on Wall Street, the Dow was down 133.41 at
10,092.63. In earlier trading, the index fell as low as 9,944.02 before bargain
hunters stepped in. The Nasdaq finished up 66.91 at 4,617.24.
</P>
<P>
	   "Rising rates are hurtful to the economy and the components of the Dow are
adjusting to that," said Larry Wachtel, market analyst with Prudential
Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Dow stocks, particularly retailers and banks, are heavily swayed by interest
rates because rising rates slow borrowing and consumer purchasing.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time the Dow traded below 10,000 was Oct. 18, and its last close
below 10,000 was April 6. The Dow is now down 14 percent from the closing high
of 11,722.98 it reached on Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one should underestimate the psychology of moving below 10,000," said
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. "When the Dow
dropping moves from the business page to the front page it will scare some
investors ... and could lead to more selling."
</P>
<P>
	   "This is like 'Groundhog Day.' We know this story. We've seen it almost
every day," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries &AMP; Co. He
referred to the movie where the main character keeps living Groundhog Day over
and over again.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past week, policymakers from the Federal Reserve have sent clear
messages that they intend to raise rates to reduce inflationary pressures in the
robust U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks, which have become largely immune to concerns about rising
interest rates, have spent much of 2000 rallying at the expense of old-line blue
chips. Investors are increasingly more attracted by the younger high-tech firms'
promise of bigger profit gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart and and Johnson &AMP; Johnson led the Dow lower. In all, 27 of the 30
Dow stocks fell today.
</P>
<P>
	   Powering the Nasdaq were Intel and fiber optics maker JDS Uniphase. But the
telecommunications firm Qualcomm was down.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.3 percent, Germany's DAX index
was down 0.7 percent, Britain's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 was down 0.9
percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.8 percent.

<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. will consolidate the North American
headquarters of its luxury brands in a new California office, the company said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The new offices of the Premier Automotive Group will house the Jaguar,
Volvo, Aston Martin, Lincoln and Mercury brands. About 200 workers will be
relocated from New Jersey, where Volvo, Jaguar and Aston Martin have their
headquarters now.
</P>
<P>
	   About 800 people will work in the new building in Irvine, Calif., which is
scheduled to be completed by 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Lincoln and Mercury are already based in California -- a location that has
drawn more interest from automakers who want a different perspective on consumer
tastes than Detroit or the East Coast can provide.
</P>
<P>
	   General Motors Corp. reopened a design studio in California last month,
joining an estimated 20 other studios, including independent contractors and
shops operated by Ford, Volvo, DaimlerChrysler AG, Volkswagen, Mazda, Honda,
Toyota, Nissan and Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford said Volvo and Jaguar would keep offices in New Jersey open. About 150
of Volvo's 500 New Jersey jobs will be transferred, while 50 to 75 of Jaguar's
140 jobs will go to California. Doolan said engineering and sales functions
would stay in New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Group Finds Candles Containing Lead  </HEADLINE>
    By CARL HARTMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Couples who light candles for a romantic dinner -- or
because the power goes out -- could put enough lead into the air to endanger
small children, said a study released Thursday by a consumer advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
	   Of 285 candles bought in the Washington area, 86 were stiffened with metal
and nine of those used high amounts of lead, the Public Citizen study said. Most
of the candles came from China or Taiwan and one came from Canada, reported Dr.
Sidney M. Wolfe, director of the organization's health research group.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. candle makers agreed in 1974 to stop using lead under a voluntary
accord with the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which investigated lead in
candles and found no specific health risk.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year the commission began another investigation, spokesman Russ Rader
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't know that there is any kind of health hazard associated with
leaded candles," he said. "Anytime we get reports of lead involving consumer
products it's a concern of ours."
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfe said the candles tested released lead amounts that exceeded what the
commission says is dangerous for kids under six years of age -- taking in more
than 15 micrograms -- 15 millionths of a gram -- in a day.
</P>
<P>
	   "In roughly 20 minutes walking or toddling or crawling into the room with
any of these candles burning, when it's at the peak concentration...would cause
more than 15 micrograms to be ingested," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Public Citizen study concluded that when the lead-wick candles burn for
three hours they can produce average air lead concentrations ranging from nine
to 33 times higher than recommended by federal guidelines.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Candle Association, which represents American manufacturers and
distributors, said the majority of wicks manufactured in the United States are
made with 100 percent cotton and no metal core. Those with metal are typically
made with zinc.
</P>
<P>
	   The group suggested that consumers can test for lead by taking the metal
core of an unused candle and rubbing it on paper. A lead wick will leave a mark
like a pencil; zinc and tin wicks will not.
</P>
<P>
	   "So as far as our samples are concerned, the test is worthless," said Wolfe,
noting just three of the nine lead wick samples tested by Public Citizen made a
smudge on paper.
</P>
<P>
	   The candle association said the United States manufactured 375 million
pounds of candles in 1998 and imported 30 million pounds, most of those from
China.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Drug Czar Visits Jungle Outpost  </HEADLINE>
   By JARED KOTLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRES ESQUINAS, Colombia (AP) -- Rockets, mortars and machine gun fire lit up
a patch of Colombia's southern jungles Thursday as White House drug czar Barry
McCaffrey witnessed the opening of a new chapter in the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   McCaffrey, in Colombia to promote a controversial $1.6 billion
anti-narcotics aid package for the Andes, squinted into a green expanse where
troops from a new U.S.-trained anti-drug battalion conducted a live-fire
exercise.
</P>
<P>
	   As soldiers in foxholes lobbed shells into the trees, a U.S.-donated
helicopter slammed a rocket at imaginary guerrilla columns advancing on the
remote Amazon outpost.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the exercise, McCaffrey, a retired general and Vietnam War hero,
gave a stirring send-off to some of the soldiers who will soon be at the front
lines in the battle to eradicate drugs at their source.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You are the ones Colombia has asked to step forward. Good luck, troops,''
he said to their enthusiastic applause.
</P>
<P>
	   Training and equipping new Colombian battalions such as the 950-man unit
based at Tres Esquinas, 250 miles south of Bogota, is the centerpiece of
Washington's strategy for stemming an explosion of cocaine and heroin production
in this Andean nation. More than half of the aid package now before the U.S.
Congress would go toward creating two new battalions like the one already up and
running, and providing the army and air force with 63 helicopters.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics say the plan could embroil the United States in a brutal,
decades-old civil conflict reminiscent of those fought in Central America during
the 1980s. Leftist rebels control vast tracts of southern jungle, financing
their insurgency by taxing peasants who grow drug crops and protecting drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
	   Human rights groups, meanwhile, charge Washington is allying itself with a
military of dubious credentials. They say the Colombian armed forces work in
concert with right-wing paramilitary militias who massacre alleged guerrilla
sympathizers and are also deeply involved in the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Outside of Washington I can't find anyone that believes the drug war makes
any sense. People just laugh at it,'' said Robert White, a former U.S.
ambassador to El Salvador who believes the aid package is a thin pretext for
fighting the guerrillas and will only inflame Colombia's conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   The base at Tres Esquinas will be the command post for a major push by the
new army battalions into the surrounding jungles where, as one Colombian officer
put it, coca ``grows like weeds.'' The military's role will be to secure areas
so U.S.-provided crop-dusters can spray the drug crops.
</P>
<P>
	   The outpost is strategically located on the border of Putumayo and Caqueta,
the two Colombian states where roughly 70 percent of the country's coca, the raw
material for cocaine, is grown.
</P>
<P>
	   Out in the surrounding wilderness are an estimated 7,000 members of
Colombia's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC, and as many as 3,000 paramilitary fighters, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the two are supposedly divided by ideology, the base's
second-in-command, Col. Luis Ricardo, said their grudge in this region is
primarily over control of the bustling drug trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Once operations begin in full, Ricardo said, the battalion expects heavy
resistance not just from the armed groups but from an estimated 17,000 peasant
families who could mount demonstrations to defend their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. and Colombian officials are already discussing plans for aiding and
resettling as many as 10,000 residents who will would be uprooted by the
eradication operations.
</P>
<P>
	   McCaffrey brushed off questions about whether the stepped-up U.S. training
role could lead eventually to a large involvement of American troops in
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are three Americans here. They are experts in intelligence,'' he
said. ``There are probably more U.S. reporters.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. military presence in Colombia fluctuates between 150 and 200
uniformed personnel on any given day, the U.S. Embassy says, and none are
allowed to accompany Colombian soldiers into combat.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite eradication efforts, cocaine production in Colombia has more than
doubled since 1995. The country produces 90 percent of the world's supply and is
a growing source of heroin.

<HEADLINE> Concerns About Rising Gas Prices  </HEADLINE>
    By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Already facing sticker shock at the gas pumps, motorists
likely will experience more price jolts this spring and summer, energy experts
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   With crude oil prices high and supplies low, refiners are not producing as
much gasoline as normal, a recipe for costlier fill-ups in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's going to be some finger-pointing if we enter the summer with
$2-a-gallon gasoline," predicted Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairman of the
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   While heating oil prices are beginning to ease, the Energy Department said
similar price spikes could flare in the summer, a heavy driving time, and the
American Automobile Association warned of possible short supplies then.
</P>
<P>
	   Many motorists are paying nearly $1.50 a gallon and even $2 for regular
gasoline, according to various studies. The national average this week was
$1.41, a nickel higher than the week earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will likely see even higher prices this spring," John Cook, petroleum
director at the Energy Information Administration, testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Cook said low inventories of crude oil and heating and diesel stocks,
combined with soaring crude prices, led to the extremely sharp and sudden price
increases in heating oil late January and early February.
</P>
<P>
	   The low inventories and a reluctance by refiners to buy crude at high prices
set the stage for the price of heating oil to double in parts of the Northeast
when the weather suddenly turned cold.
</P>
<P>
	   Now a similar scenario seems to be developing on the gasoline front that
could lead to severe price increases, especially if there is great demand,
energy experts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both gasoline and petroleum stocks are low, said Cook, adding that refiners
will have to increase gasoline production significantly to meet high summer
demand.
</P>
<P>
	   "With very little crude oil or gasoline in inventory, refiners will be
purchasing crude oil in a market short on supplies" and that means higher
prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As of this week, gasoline stocks stood at 197 million barrels, compared with
229 million barrels a year ago, according to the Energy Department. Crude oil
stocks were at 286 million barrels, 50 million fewer barrels than a year ago and
well below historic levels for this time of year.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, refineries, squeezed by the high crude prices, are far
from maximum capacity, according to government monitors.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past three weeks, refineries on average were running at about 85
percent capacity, compared with nearly 92 percent at the same time a year ago.
Also, crude prices were $12 a barrel a year ago, compared with $30 a barrel
today.
</P>
<P>
	   "We could see price increases of 20 to 25 cents a gallon" for gasoline in
April and May because of tight supplies, said Adam Sieminski, an energy
economist at DB Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
	   The automobile association, an advocacy group for 43 million motorists,
questioned whether drivers would find enough gasoline for summer travel.
</P>
<P>
	   With gasoline stocks at a 20-year low, "unless something is done ... supply
could be threatened," Susan Pikrallidas, an AAA vice president, wrote Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
	   In related developments:
</P>
<P>
	   --Some Persian Gulf oil ministers apparently have tentatively decided to
increase production. No firm decision was expected until a meeting March 27.
</P>
<P>
	   --A group of senators, including both Republican and Democratic leaders,
introduced a bill to temporarily lift a 24-cent federal diesel tax, which would
help truckers with soaring diesel costs. Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo.,
who introduced the measure, said he wants the tax lifted for one year, at a cost
to the government of $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   --Sen. Edward Kennedy and Rep. Joe Moakley, both Massachusetts Democrats,
introduced legislation that would require oil wholesalers to keep enough oil on
hand to meet demand during an average winter.

<HEADLINE> Pope Begins Egypt Pilgrimage  </HEADLINE>
   By VICTOR L. SIMPSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Denouncing violence in the name of religion as ``an
offense against God,'' Pope John Paul II called for tolerance on Thursday as he
began a visit to Egypt, where clashes between Muslims and Christians recently
left 23 people dead.
</P>
<P>
	   In beginning his pilgrimage to retrace some of the epic passages from the
Bible, John Paul became the first Roman Catholic pope to visit predominantly
Islamic Egypt.
</P>
<P>
	   The pontiff's three-day Egypt trip also gave him an opportunity to promote
closer dialogue with Muslims and to try to overcome old rifts with Orthodox
Christians.
</P>
<P>
	   The pope raised the issue of tolerance among religious groups, speaking in
general terms, as is his custom.
</P>
<P>
	   John Paul said his planned visit to Mount Sinai on Saturday, where tradition
says God gave Moses the Ten Commandments, ``will be a moment of intense prayer
for peace and for interreligious dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``To do harm, to promote violence and conflict in the name of religion is a
terrible contradiction and a great offense against God,'' the pope said shortly
after arriving at Cairo's international airport. ``But past and present history
give us many examples of such a misuse of religion.''

	   John Paul, dressed in white robes embroidered in gold, had earlier emerged
from his plane under cloudy skies and slowly made his way down red-carpeted
steps to the airport's tarmac.
</P>
<P>
	   President Hosni Mubarak greeted John Paul with a handshake at the foot of
the stairs. Those who came to welcome the pope included Muslim and Christian
religious leaders from across the region.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-three people were killed in southern Egypt in January during clashes
between Muslims and Coptic Christians, the largest religious minority in
predominantly Muslim Egypt. Most of those who died were Copts.
</P>
<P>
	   In greeting the pope, Mubarak denounced all forms of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today the Egyptian people stand together, united by their submission to
the will of God and inspired by the spirit of both Christianity and Islam,''
Mubarak said in English.
</P>
<P>
	   The pope, also speaking in English, thanked Mubarak for making his visit
possible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For many years I have been looking forward to celebrating the 2,000th
anniversary of the birth of Jesus Christ by visiting and praying at the places
specially linked to God's intervention in history,'' the pope said.
</P>
<P>
	   Few ordinary Egyptians greeted the pope at the airport, and only small
groups of people turned out to welcome the pope along his motorcade route.
</P>
<P>
	   With the flags of Egypt and the Vatican waving in the background, Mubarak
escorted the pope, who leaned on a cane, away from the plane. A band played the
processional from Verdi's ``Aida,'' an opera associated with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is really old,'' said Nancy Tawfik, 10, a Catholic school student,
after she presented John Paul with a basket of Egyptian earth to bless.
</P>
<P>
	   The hands of the 79-year-old pope trembled Thursday as he gripped the podium
while reading his speech. The shaking and slurred speech are symptoms of
Parkinson's disease, a progressive neurological disorder.
</P>
<P>
	   But the pope held up well, shaking the hands of dozens of well-wishers
during his meetings with Coptic Orthodox Pope Shenouda III and Sheik Mohammed
Sayed Tantawi, one of the most influential Muslim clerics in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
	   Tantawi drew applause when he told the pope: ``We are very happy you are so
close to the Palestinian people.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Vatican said earlier this month that Israel's control of Jerusalem was
``morally and legally unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
	   After their 10-minute meeting, the pope and Tantawi both emphasized the need
for dialogue between people of different cultures and religions.
</P>
<P>
	   Tantawi also announced he would visit the Vatican this fall. It would be his
first such trip to the center of Roman Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
	   The pope's spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said peace in the Middle East
``is important in the pope's thoughts'' but that the ``first consideration is
the pope's personal pilgrimage'' to Biblical sites.
</P>
<P>
	   The pope previously visited Cairo in 1963, while archbishop of Krakow,
Poland, with a group of prelates en route to the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, the pope is scheduled to travel to the St. Catherine monastery,
a nearly 1,500-year-old Greek Orthodox outpost in the shadow of Mount Sinai.
</P>
<P>
	   The monastery visit presents the pope with another chance to further his
desire to close the nearly 1,000-year split between the Vatican and Orthodox
churches, which separated following disputes over papal authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Next month, John Paul plans to visit Bethlehem and Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Engineers Corps Denies Budget Scheme  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid new accusations that the Army Corps of Engineers
skewed data to justify higher spending for its water projects, the agency's top
officer told Congress Thursday that there are no ``rogue officers'' scheming to
bloat the Corps' budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite assurances by Lt. Gen. Joe N. Ballard, the Corps' chief of
engineers, that officials use ``a very open process'' to review proposed
projects, members of a Senate subcommittee warned that the agency's credibility
had been battered and said they would not stand for falsified reports.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we're talking about here is the integrity of the Corps,'' said Sen.
George Voinovich, R-Ohio, chairman of a Senate transportation and infrastructure
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing came as Environmental Defense, a pro-environment group, released
what it said were internal Corps documents.
</P>
<P>
	   One memorandum on a $1 billion plan to expand locks on the Mississippi and
Illinois rivers said a preliminary study of the project was ``wrong'' and that
the Corps should not issue a ``limpwristed'' recommendation that the work be
stretched out to 2025.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmental Defense also released a slide show that officials from Corps
headquarters showed to staff in field offices, detailing a plan to expand the
agency's current $4 billion civil works budget to $6.2 billion by 2005.
</P>
<P>
	   Both documents were described in Thursday's editions of The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
	   At the hearing, Joseph W. Westphal, an assistant secretary for the Army who
oversees some of the Corps' work, said he had not been aware of the slide
presentation. He said the agency has ``a very grassroots level for making
policy'' in which recommendations for various projects usually come from local
offices, not headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not in a position from my office in the Pentagon to know everything
going on out in the field,'' Westphal told the senators.
</P>
<P>
	   Ballard, sitting beside Westphal at the witness table, said he had not shown
the presentation to his civilian superior yet because it had not been completed.
</P>
<P>
	   Ballard said criticism of the agency creates an impression that ``a bunch of
rogue officers plotted to take over this program. That simply is not true.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the proposal to increase the agency's budget was aimed at letting it
handle its huge backlog of unfinished water projects, not start new ones. And he
said agency officials cannot get projects approved without the approval of
Congress and the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It just doesn't happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Corps projects are extremely popular on Capitol Hill, where
lawmakers compete with each other annually to try to win construction for their
home districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., chairman of the Environment and Public
Works committee, said poor communication between the Corps' military and
civilian leaders ``obviously is unacceptable and we need to straighten it out.''
</P>
<P>
	   He added, ``We want to make sure we don't lose this trust you have built up
over the years with the public.''
</P>
<P>
	   And Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said reports on the Corps by The Washington Post
have left the impression that the shipping industry has been ``hotwiring''
projects to get them approved and ``have really taken a toll on your
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Corps, which dredges rivers and builds and maintains locks and dams, has
been under fire in recent weeks for allegedly falsifying its justifications for
some projects. Some of the criticism has come from within the Corps itself.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, a sworn affidavit by a Corps economist accused it of
altering a $50 million study of locks on the Mississippi and Illinois rivers to
justify their expansion in order to speed barge traffic.
</P>
<P>
	   Corps officials have denied any wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Critics Seek To End HUD Program  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL SHEPARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Citing a $1.9 million loss due to an administrative
blunder, a frequent critic of the Department of Housing and Urban Development
called Thursday for abolishing its Community Builders program.
</P>
<P>
	   Senator Christopher Bond, R-Mo., and chairman of the Senate Appropriations
Committee's panel on veterans affairs, HUD and independent agencies, said the
embattled program championed by the Clinton Administration and designed to
increase outreach to HUD clients was a failure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Community Builders program was designed as a public relations tool
that does not provide community builders with the needed expertise or
understanding of HUD housing...,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
	   The program was created in 1997 to separate ``customer service'' and public
outreach functions in HUD from the department's operation, monitoring,
enforcement and policing of dozens of housing programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The politically partisan nature of the dispute was in evidence Thursday as
Democratic senators on Bond's subcommittee voiced support for the program while
Republicans criticized it.
</P>
<P>
	   About 40 percent of the department's Community Builders are paid between
$75,000 and $100,000 a year, and they often duplicate work done through other
HUD programs, both factors that critics contend have eroded morale at the
agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The program has been touted by the Clinton administration as one of Housing
Secretary Andrew Cuomo's achievements in overhauling the department. But
problems with it first came to light last September when auditors in the
department concluded in a report that is poorly conceived, poorly run,
overpoliticized and a waste of money.
</P>
<P>
	   In the report, HUD's independent inspector general's office called the
Community Builders program an ``overly expensive'' endeavor that exacerbates the
department's long-standing management problems.
</P>
<P>
	   In one case cited Thursday, Bond said a community builder interfered with a
sale of a property and cost HUD $1.9 million in additional holding costs. Bond
also said five Community Builders were fired for ethical and conduct violations
while five others were identified with probable ethics problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy HUD Secretary Saul N. Ramirez Jr. didn't address the issue of the
$1.9 million loss during the hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview after the hearing, however, HUD spokesman Douglas Kantor
said the delay in selling the land didn't cost any additional taxpayer funds.
Kantor called Bond's statement ``factually inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ramirez told the Senate panel many at HUD are ``puzzled'' why the program
has been criticized so harshly and defended it as helping the agency become ``a
model for federal customer relations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ramirez also said several independent consulting firms, including Ernst &AMP;
Young, have praised the program as innovative and effective.
</P>
<P>
	   About half of the Community Builders were transferred into the program from
other divisions within HUD. The other half were hired from the outside and are
working under two-year contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond said he fears that the administration will try to put those 400 people
on the government's permanent payroll if the program is terminated next
September, as critics hope.

<HEADLINE> U.N. OKs Troop Commitment for Congo  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Half a year after six nations and three rebel groups
signed a cease-fire on Congo, the U.N. Security Council on Thursday authorized a
5,500-strong observer force to monitor its implementation and lay the groundwork
for possible deployment of a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   The former combatants are already pressing for the United Nations to send
peacekeepers, but the Security Council first wants the opposing sides to honor
the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The 15-member council unanimously agreed to the U.S.-drafted resolution to
send 500 military observers, supported by 5,037 security troops and logistics
personnel. The group will verify that all parties are observing last summer's
cease-fire aimed at ending a 1 1/2-year war in Congo that has destabilized
central Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke has said the United States will not
provide troops but may provide logistical support.
</P>
<P>
	   Many council members recognize that sending such a small mission to a
country a quarter the size of the United States with few roads and poor
communications may not be militarily effective but can be politically important.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Security Council has taken a critical step to help the Congo come to a
peace that its people so desperately need,'' said Holbrooke, who devoted his
presidency of the council last month to African issues. ``The time has now
arrived to act.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Congo observer mission, expected to cost around $500 million for the
first 12 months, is the fourth major U.N. peacekeeping operation approved by the
Security Council in eight months. It had already agreed to send 4,800 civilian
police to Kosovo, 11,100 peacekeepers to Sierra Leone, and 10,800 peacekeepers
and civilian police to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   The war in Congo has been called Africa's first world war. Russia's U.N.
ambassador, Sergey Lavrov, on Thursday described it as ``the largest conflict in
modern Africa.'' It has not ended despite the cease-fire agreement -- a point
reiterated by speaker after speaker.
</P>
<P>
	   Congo is backed by Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia. The rebels who took up arms
to oust President Laurent Kabila from power in August 1998 are supported by
Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
	   In Kinshasa, Congolese Foreign Affairs Minister Abdoulaye Yerodia complained
that the resolution didn't specifically name the ``aggressors'' and demand their
withdrawal. The resolution merely calls for the withdrawal of ``all foreign
forces.''
</P>
<P>
	   As recently as Wednesday, at a one-day summit in Lusaka, Zambia, the key
players renewed their commitment to implement the cease-fire quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   But Britain's Deputy Ambassador Stewart Eldon told the council ``the
situation on the ground does not look promising.'' He warned that increasing
ethnic tensions in the Kivu region in rebel-held eastern Congo threatened the
entire population and risked ``a humanitarian catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fighting must stop now,'' he said. ``International humanitarian law
must be respected.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under the resolution, deployment would be in phases and subject to
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's determination that the troops are safely able to
do their jobs. A senior U.N. official said the first observers could be deployed
within three weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Possible troop contributors include Pakistan, Jordan, Senegal and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
	   Lavrov underscored the council's general agreement that the United Nations
will not take measures to force the parties to a peace, or to force guerrillas
to disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation in Congo is so complicated, he said, ``that it would not only
be naive but dangerous to rely on its settlement by external forces.''
</P>
<P>
	   Participants at the Lusaka summit welcomed the expected deployment of U.N.
observers and urged the Security Council to quickly deploy peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   But the draft resolution gives no timetable for even considering a
peacekeeping force, saying only that Annan should make recommendations for
further deployment based on progress in implementing the cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke stressed that support for the U.N. observer mission did not
constitute ``prior approval'' for a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   Namibia's U.N. ambassador, Martin Andjaba, noting that it took the council
almost four months to adopt the resolution, called for speedy deployment of the
military observers and expressed hope that peacekeepers would soon follow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Over the years, the U.N. has brought peace to so many countries including
my own,'' Andjaba said. ``Expectations of the suffering masses in the (Congo)
for peace in their country are therefore high and rightly so. We should not let
them down.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Off 133.41; Nasdaq Up 66.91  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP)-- Blue-chip stocks fell sharply today on persistent interest
rate fears, sending the Dow Jones industrial average briefly below 10,000. The
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index, which fluctuated throughout the day
reached a new closing high for the second day in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   At the close of regular trading on Wall Street, the Dow was down 133.41 at
10,092.63. In earlier trading, the index fell as low as 9,944.02 before bargain
hunters stepped in. The Nasdaq finished up 66.91 at 4,617.24.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 7.34 at 1,353.35.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,049 up, 2,014 down and 442 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.16 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 975.5 million in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.98 to 553.89.
</P>
<P>
	   "Rising rates are hurtful to the economy and the components of the Dow are
adjusting to that," said Larry Wachtel, market analyst with Prudential
Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Dow stocks, particularly retailers and banks, are heavily swayed by interest
rates because rising rates slow borrowing and consumer purchasing.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time the Dow traded below 10,000 was Oct. 18, and its last close
below 10,000 was April 6. The Dow is now down 14 percent from the closing high
of 11,722.98 it reached on Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one should underestimate the psychology of moving below 10,000," said
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. "When the Dow
dropping moves from the business page to the front page it will scare some
investors ... and could lead to more selling."
</P>
<P>
	   "This is like 'Groundhog Day.' We know this story. We've seen it almost
every day," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries &AMP; Co. He
referred to the movie where the main character keeps living Groundhog Day over
and over again.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past week, policymakers from the Federal Reserve have sent clear
messages that they intend to raise rates to reduce inflationary pressures in the
robust U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks, which have become largely immune to concerns about rising
interest rates, have spent much of 2000 rallying at the expense of old-line blue
chips. Investors are increasingly more attracted by the younger high-tech firms'
promise of bigger profit gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart and and Johnson &AMP; Johnson led the Dow lower. In all, 27 of the 30
Dow stocks fell today.
</P>
<P>
	   Powering the Nasdaq were Intel and fiber optics maker JDS Uniphase. But the
telecommunications firm Qualcomm was down.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.3 percent, Germany's DAX index
was down 0.7 percent, Britain's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 was down 0.9
percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> US Kosovo Reinforcements Considered  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO's struggle for ethnic calm in northern Kosovo has
raised the stakes for U.S. involvement in a peacekeeping operation that has no
end in sight.
</P>
<P>
	   The 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit, aboard ships in the Mediterranean, is
standing by as potential U.S. reinforcements, although Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon said Thursday that NATO commanders have not asked for the Marines.
</P>
<P>
	   Expanding the U.S. troop presence in Kosovo would raise the risk for a force
that has largely escaped casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington and other allied capitals, there is no appetite for a major
additional buildup of troops in Kosovo. But NATO feels it cannot let the
flare-up of ethnic violence in the city of Mitrovica go unanswered.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen has said he expects the Mitrovica problem to
be resolved shortly, possibly without U.S. reinforcements. France, whose
peacekeepers are in charge of the ethnically divided Mitrovica area, is
preparing to send 600 to 700 more troops to the area.
</P>
<P>
	   The NATO's chief commander, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, requested the extra
French troops and asked NATO's political authorities for the go-ahead to put
about 1,200 other troops on a higher state of alert for possible deployment.
Among these other troops are the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO officials are to meet on the matter Friday at alliance headquarters in
Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether to send Marines is an ``open question,'' White House press secretary
Joe Lockhart said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We support the request General Clark has made,'' Lockhart told reporters.
``We take this mission very seriously and we will take the appropriate steps to
deter any further violence.''
</P>
<P>
	   The approximately 5,300 American troops now on peacekeeping duty in Kosovo
are in a U.S.-controlled sector in the southeastern part of the Serb province,
where the ethnic tension is less intense. While eight Americans have died there
since peacekeeping began in June, none of the deaths resulted from hostile
action.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference Thursday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright left
open the possibility of more American troops, but noted the United States
already has the biggest contingent. For now, it would be up to the Europeans to
add troops, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Capitol Hill, lawmakers expressed concern at the prospect of deepening
U.S. involvement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm gravely concerned about the increasing risks to the men and women of
our armed forces,'' said the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
Republican John Warner of Virginia. His committee held a two-hour closed door
briefing with top Pentagon officials Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate's top Democrat, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said that while
President Clinton does not need formal congressional approval to send more
troops to Kovoso, ``I think Congress needs to be involved in terms of
oversight.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials say the best solution would be to rapidly increase the number
of trained international police for Kosovo because military peacekeepers are not
well suited for a criminal justice role.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must recognize that old models of peacekeeping don't also meet current
challenges,'' Albright said. She said Clinton had ordered the State Department
to create an office responsible for issues associated with U.S. participation in
the criminal justice aspects of peace operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, a contingent of U.S. Marines aboard ships in the Mediterranean is
on standby as potential reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
	   If called upon, the Marines most likely would be used in a role similar to
that of an airborne Army group that spent several days in Mitrovica this week.
</P>
<P>
	   In a surprise raid Wednesday, about 350 members of the Army's 504th
Parachute Infantry Regiment swept through an ethnically mixed neighborhood in
Mitrovica, searching house-to-house. They arrested eight people and seized
rifles and other weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first time the Americans had been on the Serb-dominated side of
Mitovica since they and German forces were driven away Sunday by stone-throwing
Serbs during a weapons search.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark, the NATO commander, has said that in the months since the alliance
began monitoring an uneasy peace in Kosovo last June, too many of the allies
have allowed their troop totals to shrink. Overall, the peacekeeping force in
Kosovo has dropped from a peak of roughly 50,000 to about 37,000 now.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. contingent has fallen from a peak of about 7,000 to 5,300. An
additional 1,100 U.S. support troops are in nearby Macedonia.

<HEADLINE> Study Looks at Health of Hispanics  </HEADLINE>
    By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Puerto Ricans are in poorer health than other Hispanics
living in the United States, a government study finds.
</P>
<P>
	   Puerto Ricans reported being sick more often than Mexican-Americans,
Cuban-Americans and others of Hispanic descent and had more doctor visits,
hospital stays and sick days off from work and school than other Hispanics, a
four-year study by the National Center for Health Statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
	   The study, being released Friday, is the government's first ever effort to
look at health differences among Hispanic groups after the explosive growth in
the nation's Hispanic population in the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 30 million people of Hispanic origin reside in the United States,
representing 11 percent of the population. That's up 36 percent from 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Other studies have shown that as a group Hispanics lag in many areas of
health. Diabetes, AIDS and depression are major health problems for Hispanics.
They also are more likely to lack health insurance; recent studies have shown
that a fourth of the 44 million people without insurance are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
	   This latest study is evidence that there is variance among subgroups of the
culture that require more study, said Anjum Hajat, the report's author.
</P>
<P>
	   "Often the medical literature just lump together all Hispanic groups," said
Hajat.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, which looked at data from a national health survey of all
Americans collected from 1992 through 1995, focuses on the largest Hispanic
subgroups: Mexicans, who make up 63 percent of all Hispanics, Puerto Ricans,
which represent 11 percent and Cubans, which comprise 4 percent. Another 22
percent of people of Hispanic origins other than those three were grouped
together.
</P>
<P>
	   The report found:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Eighteen percent of Puerto Ricans reported being in fair or poor health,
compared with 16 percent of Mexicans, 14 percent of Cubans and 12 percent of
other Hispanic groups.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Eighty-three percent of Puerto Ricans reported seeing a doctor in the
past year, compared to 78 percent of Cubans, 77 percent of other Hispanics and
69 percent of Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Puerto Ricans reported being sick more than the other groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Hispanic health experts warned that the study, which isolated Hispanics'
data out of a general study of Americans' health, could mask important health
information about Hispanics and reinforce stereotypes that Hispanics, because
they tend to have lower incomes than other Americans, are in poorer health.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Hispanics live longer than whites and Hispanic women have lower
rates of breast cancer but more cervical cancer than non-Hispanic women,
according to the National Coalition of Hispanic Health and Human Services
Organizations, a Washington-based advocacy organization.
</P>
<P>
	   "The kind of data used is missing the bigger issues," said Jane Delgado,
president.
</P>
<P>
	   The study was based on interviews with 36,924 Mexican-Americans, 6,922
Puerto Ricans living in the United States, 3,008 Cuban-Americans and 13,865
people of other Hispanic origin.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP)-- Blue-chip stocks fell sharply today on persistent interest
rate fears, sending the Dow Jones industrial average briefly below 10,000. The
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index, which fluctuated throughout the day
reached a new closing high for the second day in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   At the close of regular trading on Wall Street, the Dow was down 133.41 at
10,092.63. In earlier trading, the index fell as low as 9,944.02 before bargain
hunters stepped in. The Nasdaq finished up 66.91 at 4,617.24.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 7.34 at 1,353.35.
</P>

Stock Exchange, with 1,049 up, 2,014 down and 442 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.16 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 975.5 million in
the previous session.

<P>
	   "Rising rates are hurtful to the economy and the components of the Dow are
adjusting to that," said Larry Wachtel, market analyst with Prudential
Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Dow stocks, particularly retailers and banks, are heavily swayed by interest
rates because rising rates slow borrowing and consumer purchasing.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time the Dow traded below 10,000 was Oct. 18, and its last close
below 10,000 was April 6. The Dow is now down 14 percent from the closing high
of 11,722.98 it reached on Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one should underestimate the psychology of moving below 10,000," said
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. "When the Dow
dropping moves from the business page to the front page it will scare some
investors ... and could lead to more selling."
</P>
<P>
	   "This is like 'Groundhog Day.' We know this story. We've seen it almost
every day," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries &AMP; Co. He
referred to the movie where the main character keeps living Groundhog Day over
and over again.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past week, policymakers from the Federal Reserve have sent clear
messages that they intend to raise rates to reduce inflationary pressures in the
robust U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks, which have become largely immune to concerns about rising
interest rates, have spent much of 2000 rallying at the expense of old-line blue
chips. Investors are increasingly more attracted by the younger high-tech firms'
promise of bigger profit gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart and and Johnson &AMP; Johnson led the Dow lower. In all, 27 of the 30
Dow stocks fell today.
</P>
<P>
	   Powering the Nasdaq were Intel and fiber optics maker JDS Uniphase. But the
telecommunications firm Qualcomm was down.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.3 percent, Germany's DAX index

<HEADLINE> Feds Investigate Auto Defect Deaths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal safety agency is studying the engineering of air
bag systems on some older model Hyundai Accent cars because seven children have
been killed by the deploying devices in crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also is investigating
some General Motors cars after more than 200 complaints that the shoulder belts
jam and do not retract, according to a monthly report released Thursday by the
agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency has upgraded the investigation into Accent cars from model years
1995 through 1997 to study how the air bag systems work and determine whether
the rate of air bag deaths is worse than in other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   There are about 170,000 of the cars on the road from those model years.
There have been seven child deaths in low- or moderate-speed crashes involving
the cars, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two infants also were killed while riding in rear-facing infant seats. But
those deaths were not part of the investigation because safety officials have
repeatedly said, and auto warning labels indicate, that infants in rear-facing
infant seats should never be placed in front of air bags. The seats position
infant heads too close to the bags when they inflate.
</P>
<P>
	   Hyundai spokesman Mike Hanson said in a company statement that the children
killed were either unbelted or improperly belted. ``Hyundai has clearly and
consistently warned its customers that children should always be placed in the
rear seats of cars equipped with air bags,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Air bags have been blamed for the deaths of at least 150 people -- mostly
unbelted children or small adults -- in low-speed accidents they otherwise
should have survived, according to NHTSA data.
</P>
<P>
	   In the case of GM seat belts, the report said 207 consumers complained about
front shoulder belt webbing jamming on Buick Park Avenue cars from model years
1997 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   There are about 171,000 of the cars on the road.
</P>
<P>
	   GM has made several modifications to the seat belt system, including using
stronger belt webbing that was less susceptible to twisting and narrowing the
belt webbing guide slot, the report said. Since last summer, GM has had a repair
kit available for the front shoulder belts.
</P>
<P>
	   However, NHTSA investigators said they were concerned that dealers appear
unable to address many consumer complaints about the problem.

<HEADLINE> Higher Gas Prices Seen for Spring  </HEADLINE>
    By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Already facing sticker shock at the gas pumps, motorists
likely will experience more price jolts this spring and summer, energy experts
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   With crude oil prices high and supplies low, refiners are not producing as
much gasoline as normal, a recipe for costlier fill-ups in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's going to be some finger-pointing if we enter the summer with
$2-a-gallon gasoline," predicted Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairman of the
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   While heating oil prices are beginning to ease, the Energy Department said
similar price spikes could flare in the summer, a heavy driving time, and the
American Automobile Association warned of possible short supplies then.
</P>
<P>
	   Many motorists are paying nearly $1.50 a gallon and even $2 for regular
gasoline, according to various studies. The national average this week was
$1.41, a nickel higher than the week earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will likely see even higher prices this spring," John Cook, petroleum
director at the Energy Information Administration, testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Cook said low inventories of crude oil and heating and diesel stocks,
combined with soaring crude prices, led to the extremely sharp and sudden price
increases in heating oil late January and early February.
</P>
<P>
	   The low inventories and a reluctance by refiners to buy crude at high prices
set the stage for the price of heating oil to double in parts of the Northeast
when the weather suddenly turned cold.
</P>
<P>
	   Now a similar scenario seems to be developing on the gasoline front that
could lead to severe price increases, especially if there is great demand,
energy experts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both gasoline and petroleum stocks are low, said Cook, adding that refiners
will have to increase gasoline production significantly to meet high summer
demand.
</P>
<P>
	   "With very little crude oil or gasoline in inventory, refiners will be
purchasing crude oil in a market short on supplies" and that means higher
prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As of this week, gasoline stocks stood at 197 million barrels, compared with
229 million barrels a year ago, according to the Energy Department. Crude oil
stocks were at 286 million barrels, 50 million fewer barrels than a year ago and
well below historic levels for this time of year.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, refineries, squeezed by the high crude prices, are far
from maximum capacity, according to government monitors.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past three weeks, refineries on average were running at about 85
percent capacity, compared with nearly 92 percent at the same time a year ago.
Also, crude prices were $12 a barrel a year ago, compared with $30 a barrel
today.
</P>
<P>
	   "We could see price increases of 20 to 25 cents a gallon" for gasoline in
April and May because of tight supplies, said Adam Sieminski, an energy
economist at DB Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
	   The automobile association, an advocacy group for 43 million motorists,
questioned whether drivers would find enough gasoline for summer travel.
</P>
<P>
	   With gasoline stocks at a 20-year low, "unless something is done ... supply
could be threatened," Susan Pikrallidas, an AAA vice president, wrote Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
	   In related developments:
</P>
<P>
	   --Some Persian Gulf oil ministers apparently have tentatively decided to
increase production. No firm decision was expected until a meeting March 27.
</P>
<P>
	   --A group of senators, including both Republican and Democratic leaders,
introduced a bill to temporarily lift a 24-cent federal diesel tax, which would
help truckers with soaring diesel costs. Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo.,
who introduced the measure, said he wants the tax lifted for one year, at a cost
to the government of $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   --Sen. Edward Kennedy and Rep. Joe Moakley, both Massachusetts Democrats,
introduced legislation that would require oil wholesalers to keep enough oil on
hand to meet demand during an average winter.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Recommends Changes to Boats  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID A. LIEB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The National Transportation Safety Board
recommended today that backup floation devices be installed in amphibious boats
to prevent the kind of rapid flooding that sank a tourist boat last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Miss Majestic plunged to the bottom of Lake Hamilton in a matter of
minutes May 1 after taking on water. Thirteen passengers drowned.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Coast Guard in December concluded that a dislodged drive-shaft seal
allowed water to flood the hull. The boat's bilge pump failed to work.
</P>
<P>
	   The NTSB said boat operators should not rely on the pumps only, recommending
the installation of backup flotation devices -- watertight bulkheads, buoyant
materials inside the hull or flotation attachments on the outside of the boat.
</P>
<P>
	   Amphibious boats sink easily because they have no backup flotation, NTSB
Chairman Jim Hall said in a letter asking the industry to respond to the
recommendations within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Consequently, the safety board concludes that the potential exists for
another life-threatening accident similar to the sinking of the Miss Majestic,
unless the vulnerability to flooding and sinking is addressed,'' the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The boat that sank in Arkansas was a Duck, originally known as a DUKW. It
was a vintage World War II vessel designed for military purposes, then converted
to take tourists through the Hot Springs area.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationwide, more than 250 amphibious passenger boats are in service. Most
are ducks and the rest are similar models.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 18 amphibious boats had accidents -- six involving some degree of
flooding -- between March 6, 1991, and May 1, 1999, according to Coast Guard
data. None was fatal.
</P>
<P>
	   The safety board said it has learned of at least nine other incidents
involving significant flooding that were not reported to the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
	   Amphibious boats have several flooding threats. The safety board said water
can leak in through a failed hull fitting, missing plug or a hull that is
cracked by running aground. Also, the road travel and repeated entry and exit
from water can wear on the vessel's hull and loosen mechanical joints and
connections.
</P>
<P>
	   Because the boats have open interiors and a low amount of space between the
stern and the water, it doesn't take long for the boats to flood and sink, the
NTSB said.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. Reviews Deutch Case  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department, which earlier declined to bring
criminal charges against former CIA Director John Deutch for home computer
security breaches, is taking a new look ``to see whether there is any basis for
further action,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno said the inquiry would cover both Deutch's conduct and the CIA's
follow-up.
</P>
<P>
	   Top members of the Senate Intelligence Committee welcomed Reno's new
interest but said they would move ahead with their own inquiry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's sad she didn't take a closer look at it earlier, because something is
wrong and we're going to get to the bottom of it,'' said the committee chairman,
Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the committee, which heard from Deutch earlier in this week, is
turning more attention to why it took the CIA 18 months to notify congressional
oversight committees after the agency discovered in December 1996 that Deutch
had mishandled classified material.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is inexplicable to me and to others on the committee,'' Shelby said,
suggesting ``possibly a cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are a lot of unanswered questions,'' said Sen. Richard Bryan of
Nevada, the committee's vice chairman and senior Democrat.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno discussed the review in response to questions at her weekly news
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The department is looking at the whole matter, reviewing the whole matter
to see whether there is any basis for further action,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch, CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996, stored and processed
hundreds of files of highly classified material on unprotected home computers
that he and family members also used to connect the Internet, according to an
internal CIA investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Now a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Deutch was
stripped of his security clearances by CIA director George Tenet in August. As a
former deputy defense secretary, Deutch also had Pentagon clearances, but he
voluntarily gave them up this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch has apologized, both in private testimony to the Senate Intelligence
Committee and in a brief appearance Tuesday before reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Last spring, after a yearlong review of the 1996 episode, the Justice
Department's criminal division declined to prosecute Deutch for mishandling
classified information. The division found the lapses were sloppy rather than
nefarious, and referred the case to the CIA inspector general for administrative
discipline.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno and her aides declined to specify what questions were being reviewed.
They said only that the entire matter was under scrutiny, when asked whether the
Deutch criminal investigation could be reopened or whether there was any
obstruction of justice of top CIA officials.
</P>
<P>
	   One Justice official, requesting anonymity, said two criminal division
lawyers are handling the review.
</P>
<P>
	   It is more comprehensive than the one the Justice Department announced three
weeks ago, this official said. At that time, Justice lawyers were said to be
taking a look at the CIA inspector general's report, but, based on information
then available, there were no plans to reopen the Deutch investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice officials said then that they had not seen anything in the inspector
general report or during congressional hearings that they had not already known
when they decided last spring not to prosecute Deutch.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate committee has been moving ahead with its own probe.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to hearing from Deutch, the committee has questioned CIA
Inspector General Brit Snider and FBI and CIA security officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Former CIA general counsel Michael O'Neil has been invited to testify on
March 1.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neil, who left the agency in 1997, at first declined to turn over computer
storage cards from Deutch's computers and delayed notifying the Justice
Department of the matter, according to an unclassified version of an internal
CIA inspector general's report released earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel also intends to call Nora Slatkin, the CIA's former executive
director and now an official with Citicorp.
</P>
<P>
	   The CIA's inspector general report found that her actions delayed ``a prompt
and thorough investigation'' of the Deutch case.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby, in an interview, said he does not know if any laws were broken but
said Deutch ``violated some of the most sacred rules, if not the laws.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said his committee's investigation thus far suggests that Tenet and his
top deputies were frozen in inaction ``because of the friendship, the
relationship they had with Dr. Deutch.''

<HEADLINE> Labor Leaders Resign From Panel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and other labor leaders
resigned Thursday from a private panel that President Clinton appointed as
advisers on trade.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, Sweeney
complained that business leaders and their interests have outweighed labor and
consumer representatives on the president's Advisory Committee for Trade Policy
and Negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   "This imbalance has contributed to a corresponding imbalance in U.S. trade
policy," Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
	   Barshefsky had touted the labor leader's support for a resolution by the
panel supporting Clinton's overall trade agenda last fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Sweeney's resignation follows a Jan. 25 announcement by the advisory panel's
chairman, Proctor &AMP; Gamble chairman John E. Pepper, that the only meeting this
year would be to consider a resolution in support of the administration's
campaign to get permanent normal trade status for China.
</P>
<P>
	   The AFL-CIO has launched a major advertising and lobbying campaign against
the China initiative.
</P>
<P>
	   Resigning from the ACTPN along with Sweeney were Jay Mazur, president of
UNITE!, a New York Union, and Lenore Miller, president emeritus of the Retail,
Wholesale and Department Store Union.
</P>
<P>
	   That leaves no labor representatives on the panel, which currently includes
27 corporate members, one environmental group and one consumer
organization.

<HEADLINE> Europeans Shocked Over Spy Charge  </HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANT BRAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Europeans reacted sharply Thursday to reports that
a U.S.-led spy network snoops on billions of private phone calls, faxes and
e-mails.
</P>
<P>
	   Allegations that the bugging network is eavesdropping on Europe's businesses
were unveiled Wednesday in a report commissioned by the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite denials from governments named in the report, the head of the EU's
assembly called for strong action.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have every reason to be shocked at the fact that this form of
espionage, which has been going on for a number of years, has not prompted any
official protest,'' European Parliament Speaker Nicole Fontaine said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report inspired demands for further investigation Thursday. European
leaders called the report shocking and said people should to be wary about what
they say electronically.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's like a technological nightmare extracted from the crazy conspiracy
theories of the X-Files,'' wrote the leading Portuguese daily Publico. The Dutch
daily ``De Telegraaf'' headlined its story: ``U.S. guilty of misuse of
satellites.''
</P>
<P>
	   The EU Commission has not said whether it will launch an investigation into
the allegations, but commission officials said they are ``very concerned.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S.-led intelligence group, called Echelon, also includes Britain,
Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It was set up at the beginning of the Cold
War in 1947 and gradually grew to include a network of surveillance-interception
stations spread across the globe.
</P>
<P>
	   An earlier report said firms in EU nations lose several billion dollars per
year as a result of corporate espionage. Allegations that Echelon carries out
such spying against fellow European allies have met with deep concern,
especially from the French, who themselves are members of a wider intelligence
ring connected to Echelon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to be as prudent as possible in the transmission of data. Such
data must never contain vital information, especially when its relayed by
retransmission satellite ... with international connections,'' Justice Minister
Elisabeth Guigou told the National Assembly in Paris.
</P>
<P>
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair denied the reports outright on a visit to
EU headquarters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   '''No' is the short answer to that. These things are governed by extremely
strict rules and those rules will always be applied properly,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin denied any
involvement in commercial espionage by the National Security Agency. On
Thursday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said her department does not
comment on ``actual or alleged intelligence activities.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``But as our spokesman said, the NSA is not authorized to provide
intelligence information to private firms, and that agency acts in strict
accordance with U.S. law,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report on Echelon was written by a British investigative journalist,
Duncan Campbell. Campbell said most international Internet communications are
being routed through the United States -- and through nine known NSA
interception sites.
</P>
<P>
	   Intelligence facilities can easily tap into ``billions of messages per
hour,'' including telephone calls, fax transmissions and private e-mails, he
said. He urged the EU to take action to protect against unwanted interception of
communications, insisting the interceptions violate human rights.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkish courts cracked down against the only legal
pro-Kurdish party Thursday, sentencing the party's leader to prison and bringing
charges against three mayors -- moves likely to alienate Kurds and harm
relations with Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said top members of the People's Democracy Party had acted in
support of the Kurdish rebels led by Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
	   An Ankara security court sentenced 18 members of the party, including its
leader, Ahmet Turan Demir, and his predecessor, Murat Bozlak, to three years and
nine months in prison on charges of aiding Kurdish rebels, the Anatolia news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The court said the party members helped the rebels by staging hunger strikes
in 1998 to oppose Turkish attempts to pressure Italy to extradite Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
	   Ocalan was later captured by Turkish commandos in Kenya, brought to Turkey
and sentenced to death for treason and separatism. A second separatism trial
against Ocalan and other members of his organization was adjourned Wednesday
until April 24.
</P>
<P>
	   In Diyarbakir, a court on Thursday arraigned three of the party's leading
mayors on charges of aiding Ocalan's rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Those arrested included Feridun Celik, the mayor of Diyarbakir, the largest
city in the overwhelmingly Kurdish southeast. Each mayor faces up to 7 1/2 years
in prison if convicted. No trial date has been set.
</P>
<P>
	   The crackdown has led to protests from European Union countries -- criticism
which angered many Turks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What has it got to do with the EU?'' Yeni Safak newspaper quoted President
Suleyman Demirel as saying. ``There is no privilege in Turkey to commit
crimes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kurds reacted with outrage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``According to the official mentality, Kurd equals criminal,'' Ali Sapan
wrote in the pro-Kurdish newspaper, Ozgur Bakis.
</P>
<P>
	   In April, the People's Democracy Party won the mayorships of 37 cities and
towns in the southeast. The party says it has been trying to act as a bridge
between Kurds demanding cultural rights and the government.
</P>
<P>
	   But many Turks fear the party is simply a front for rebels. Both the party
and Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party demand cultural rights for Kurds, such as
the right to teach or broadcast in Kurdish.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Sami Gungor showed the court pictures of the mayors with Murat
Karayilan, a senior Kurdistan Workers Party commander who is seeking asylum in
the Netherlands, Hurriyet newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayors' lawyer, Sinan Tanrikulu, dismissed the charges and said
authorities were not able to present any ``serious or solid'' evidence against
his clients, private NTV television reported.
</P>
<P>
	   EU Parliament President Nicole Fontaine had urged Turkey to release the
mayors, who were detained this weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey was named a candidate to join the European Union in December. But
members stressed that it must first improve its human rights record and enact
more democratic laws.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Don't Reject China Trade  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Thursday a trade deal with China
is a ``once-in-a-generation'' opportunity that should not be rejected because of
Beijing's human rights problems, global arms sales or threats against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal is vital for America's economic and national security interests,
Clinton said, and it would be ``a devastating setback'' if Congress killed the
accord.
</P>
<P>
	   The president spoke about China in an economic speech in Philadelphia and
earlier in Washington before the Business Council, a gathering of corporate
leaders eager to win access to China's market, the largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   He urged the business chiefs to help him persuade Congress to give China
permanent trade benefits in return for its pledge to open its doors to American
goods.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S.-China deal is a key ingredient in China's campaign to win admission
to the World Trade Organization, a 135-nation organization which sets the rules
for global trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional critics say the United States should not reward China with
trade benefits as long as it abuses human rights, intimidates Taiwan and sells
weapons to other countries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``China still does things that we don't agree with,'' Clinton acknowledged.
``We can't control what China does and I'm not going to stand here and tell you
that they're going to turn out as we would hope.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I'll tell you this, we can control what we do,'' the president said.
``If we do this, 20 years from now we'll look back and wonder why we ever even
debated it. If we don't, 20 years from now we'll still be kicking ourselves in
the seat of the pants for turning away from an enormous opportunity to give our
children a safer world.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said that China's willingness to open its markets is ``the kind of
opportunity that comes along once in a generation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Already facing formidable opposition, the deal ran into more trouble this
week with China's escalation of threats against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most members of Congress do not question the economic benefit,'' the
president said. ``Critics are more likely to say things like this: `China is a
growing threat to Taiwan and other neighbors, we shouldn't strengthen it; China
is a drag on labor and environmental markets and rights and if we put them in
the WTO they will block further progress on those issues; or China is an
offender of human rights and we shouldn't reward it; or China is a dangerous
proliferator and we shouldn't empower it.'
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now all these concerns, I believe, are legitimate,'' Clinton said. ``The
question is whether they will be advanced or undermined by the decision Congress
will make, and America will make, on letting China into the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said the United States will ``continue to reject the use of force as
a means to resolve the Taiwan question. We'll also continue to make absolutely
clear that the issues between Beijing and Taiwan must be resolved peacefully and
with the assent of people of Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said the China vote was ``the most important question that Congress
will take up in the first half of this year.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't underestimate how hard it will be,'' he said, promising to ``push
as hard as I can to secure agreement as quickly as possible.''

<HEADLINE> USDA: Farm Income To Rebound  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Food prices will rise by about 2 percent a year over the
next decade, less than the overall cost of living, and farm income will start to
rebound in 2002 as global demand picks up, the government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Competition among restaurants will keep the cost of eating away from home
from increasing more than about 2.2 percent a year, while prices at the
supermarket should rise about 2.1 percent annually, the Agriculture Department
said in its latest long-term economic projections. The overall rate of inflation
is expected to be 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "American consumers will be blessed again in 2000 with an abundant,
affordable food supply," said Keith Collins, USDA's chief economist.
</P>
<P>
	   While prices are rising for beef and pork, reflecting tighter supplies,
dairy products and citrus are likely to be cheaper this year. Fresh vegetables
also should be plentiful, based on this winter's acreage, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the decade, USDA foresees some price cuts for meat and poultry and
continued sharp swings from year to year in dairy products. The largest price
increases are expected in fruits and vegetables, as much as 3.5 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   For farmers, the good news depends on a projected increase in U.S.
agricultural exports. The Asian economic crisis sent grain prices plummeting two
years ago as exports dropped, and they have yet to recover.
</P>
<P>
	   "Global economies are improving," Collins said. "World economic growth in
2000 is forecast to exceed 3 percent, a rate not seen since 1997."
</P>
<P>
	   Net farm income reached $48 billion last year, largely because of a record
$22.7 billion in direct government payments. Farm earnings are expected to fall
to $40.4 billion this year and then to $34.4 billion in 2001 before turning back
up in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   The projections don't account for the possibility that Congress will approve
another multibillion package of farm assistance this year. The Clinton
administration is proposing at least $3 billion in additional spending that
wasn't included in the forecast.
</P>
<P>
	   Cash receipts from crops and livestock are expected to fall to $189.9
billion this year from last year's $191.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. wheat production could fall 200 million bushels because of lower
plantings this winter and a lingering drought on the Plains, Collins said. That
won't do much to increase wheat prices, however. Wheat stocks are expected to be
the largest they've been since 1988, and Europe could have a record crop.
</P>
<P>
	   "Overall conditions in the farm economy are similar to last year," Collins
said. "Markets for major commodities, particularly crops, are very weak, but an
overall farm economic crisis has not materialized," largely due to government
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Farm exports are expected to increase slightly this year, from $49 billion
to $49.5 billion, because of higher sales of cotton and livestock. In 2001,
exports are projected to jump to $51.2 billion and then rise to $75.9 billion by
the end of the decade. The largest gains are expected to come in sales of wheat,
corn and cotton.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. exports could be much stronger, depending how much China winds up
buying, the department's report said.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA is predicting that sales of farm products to China could triple to $3
billion annually if China enters the World Trade Organization. Tariffs on beef
alone could drop from 45 percent to 12 percent under an agreement by China to
lower its trade barriers.

<HEADLINE> Crude Up; Silver, Cocoa Down  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Crude oil prices pushed 2 percent higher Thursday as new evidence of
tightening U.S. inventories caused investors to shrug off OPEC's talk of raising
production, figuring it won't be enough to replenish supplies quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   Other energy commodities also rose.
</P>
<P>
	   In other markets, silver slipped to a one-month low and cocoa fell.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil futures blasted briefly back over $30 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, resuming their relentless year-long rise upward in the wake
of a brief pause that ended early this week.
</P>
<P>
	   West Texas intermediate crude for April delivery settled at $29.97 a barrel,
up 58 cents, after rising as high as $30.15.
</P>
<P>
	   The 11-month-old agreement on lowered output by world oil producers that has
sent prices skyward ever since is increasingly expected to be revised when it
expires March 31. By how much remains a topic of intense speculation.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries won't make a final
decision until its March 27 meeting, a consensus for hiking production appeared
evident when Gulf oil ministers -- including key OPEC members -- met Wednesday
in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior United Arab Emirates oil official said Thursday a production
increase will be gradual and will be in the range of 1.5 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
	   But that's only an estimate. And with the possibility of shortages looming,
market watchers think even that figure won't be enough to get world supplies
back above dangerously low levels quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market is worried that they (producers) are not being more
demonstrative. Until we get some solid numbers, people are nervous on the long
side," said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst for Alaron Trading Corp. in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no guarantee that what they add is going to be enough," Flynn said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1.5 million barrels daily would add some 6 percent to world production;
analysts say an output increase closer to 9 percent is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Energy reported Thursday that U.S. crude inventories fell
300,000 barrels last week -- a larger drop than expected. Domestic stocks are
nearly 40 million barrels, which the DOE said is a four-year low.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil prices also were pushed higher by government figures showing that
gasoline stocks slipped 2.9 million barrels last week, or 1.5 percent, to 285.5
million barrels. That drop exceeded the 432,000-barrel decline reported a day
earlier by the American Petroleum Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other energy commodities, March heating oil rose 1.89 cent to 78.02
cents a gallon, March unleaded gasoline rose .43 cent to 85.05 cents a gallon
and March natural gas rose 1.9 cents to $2.549 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
	   In London, April Brent crude from the North Sea rose 31 cents to $27.37 a
barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading, on the Comex division of the New York Merc, silver was the
hardest-hit metal in an across-the-board drop. A 5.5 million-ounce jump in Comex
warehouse stocks and rumors that they may increase by as much as another 30
million ounces over the next week buoyed the price.
</P>
<P>
	   March silver fell 9 cents to $5.166 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
	   A few blocks away on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange, cocoa
declined on evidence that West African harvests, the world's biggest crops, are
even larger than anticipated. New-crop arrivals at ports in No. 1 producer Ivory
Coast are exceeding expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   May cocoa settled down $15 at $791 per ton.

<HEADLINE> Engineers Corps Denies Budget Scheme  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid new accusations that the Army Corps of Engineers
skewed data to justify higher spending for its water projects, the agency's top
officer told Congress Thursday that there are no ``rogue officers'' scheming to
bloat the Corps' budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite assurances by Lt. Gen. Joe N. Ballard, the Corps' chief of
engineers, that officials use ``a very open process'' to review proposed
projects, members of a Senate subcommittee warned that the agency's credibility
had been battered and said they would not stand for falsified reports.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we're talking about here is the integrity of the Corps,'' said Sen.
George Voinovich, R-Ohio, chairman of a Senate transportation and infrastructure
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing came as Environmental Defense, a pro-environment group, released
what it said were internal Corps documents.
</P>
<P>
	   One memorandum on a $1 billion plan to expand locks on the Mississippi and
Illinois rivers said a preliminary study of the project was ``wrong'' and that
the Corps should not issue a ``limp-wristed'' recommendation that the work be
stretched out to 2025.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmental Defense also released a slide show that officials from Corps
headquarters showed to staff in field offices, detailing a plan to expand the
agency's current $4 billion civil works budget to $6.2 billion by 2005.
</P>
<P>
	   Both documents were described in Thursday's editions of The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
	   After the hearing, Army Secretary Louis Caldera announced that the National
Academy of Sciences, a congressionally chartered private group, would review the
Corps' study of the Mississippi and Illinois river project. The Army has already
begun investigating other allegations against the Corps.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to assure you that we take these charges seriously and that we are
addressing them on both the specifics of the issues raised as well as the more
fundamental issues of oversight and control of the civil works program,''
Caldera said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   At the hearing, Joseph W. Westphal, an assistant secretary for the Army who
oversees some of the Corps' work, said he had not been aware of the slide
presentation. He said the agency has ``a very grassroots level for making
policy'' in which recommendations for various projects usually come from local
offices, not headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not in a position from my office in the Pentagon to know everything
going on out in the field,'' Westphal told the senators.
</P>
<P>
	   Ballard, sitting beside Westphal at the witness table, said he had not shown
the presentation to his civilian superior yet because it had not been completed.
</P>
<P>
	   Ballard said criticism of the agency creates an impression that ``a bunch of
rogue officers plotted to take over this program. That simply is not true.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the proposal to increase the agency's budget was aimed at letting it
handle its huge backlog of unfinished water projects, not start new ones. And he
said agency officials cannot get projects approved without the approval of
Congress and the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It just doesn't happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Corps projects are extremely popular on Capitol Hill, where
lawmakers compete with each other annually to try to win construction for their
home districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., chairman of the Environment and Public
Works committee, said poor communication between the Corps' military and
civilian leaders ``obviously is unacceptable and we need to straighten it out.''
</P>
<P>
	   He added, ``We want to make sure we don't lose this trust you have built up
over the years with the public.''
</P>
<P>
	   And Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said reports on the Corps by The Washington Post
have left the impression that the shipping industry has been ``hotwiring''
projects to get them approved and ``have really taken a toll on your
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Corps, which dredges rivers and builds and maintains locks and dams, has
been under fire in recent weeks for allegedly falsifying its justifications for
some projects. Some of the criticism has come from within the Corps itself.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, a sworn affidavit by a Corps economist accused it of
altering a $50 million study of locks on the Mississippi and Illinois rivers to
justify their expansion in order to speed barge traffic.
</P>
<P>
	   Corps officials have denied any wrongdoing.

Dow Ends Off 133.41; Nasdaq Up
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP)-- Blue-chip stocks fell sharply today on persistent
interest rate fears, sending the Dow Jones industrial average
briefly below 10,000. The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite
index, which fluctuated throughout the day reached a new closing
high for the second day in a row. At the close of regular trading
on Wall Street, the Dow was down 133.41 at 10,092.63. In earlier
trading, the index fell as low as 9,944.02 before bargain hunters
stepped in. The Nasdaq finished up 66.91 at 4,617.24. Dow stocks,
particularly retailers and banks, are heavily swayed by interest
rates because rising rates slow borrowing and consumer purchasing.

	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Thousands of investors suing Marriott over
limited partnerships formed in the 1980s have reached a tentative
settlement under which the hotel giant would buy back 120 Courtyard
by Marriott inns for $372 million. The agreement disclosed in court
today also calls for Marriott International Inc. and Host Marriott
Corp. each to pay $31 million to end lawsuits involving certain
limited partnerships aside from the Courtyard by Marriott deals.
Lawyers for both sides characterized the deal as a ``win-win''

	   Gulf Nations OK Oil Production Hike
</P>
<P>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Gulf oil ministers have
agreed to increase output to stabilize international markets --
where the price of oil is near an nine-year high. Officials
indicated today that most ministers at a meeting in Saudi Arabia
agreed to increase production, but have not agreed on how much. A
senior United Arab Emirates oil official said a production increase
will be gradual and in the range of 1.5 million barrels a day.

	   Concerns About Rising Gas Prices
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Already facing sticker shock at the gas pumps,
motorists likely will experience more price jolts this spring and
summer, energy experts said today. With crude oil prices high and
supplies low, refiners are not producing as much gasoline as
normal, a recipe for costlier fill-ups in the months ahead. the
Energy Department said prices could flare in the summer, a heavy
driving time, and the American Automobile Association warned of
possible short supplies then.

	   Panel Hears Day-Trading Dangers
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Day-trading firms accept people as customers
who shouldn't be trading and improperly raid customers' accounts to
make loans to other investors to keep them trading, Senate
investigators have found. Alyce Wenzel told a congressional hearing
today that before her son Scott Webb was shot and killed by a
fellow day trader in Atlanta in July, she was unaware he had
borrowed $30,000 from another investor. ``All his money was
borrowed to begin with,'' Wenzel testified before the investigative
subcommittee of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. Also
today, the National Association of Securities Dealers, a
self-policing brokers' group, announced that it had disciplined
eight day-trading firms or individuals running them, for alleged
misuse of customer funds, improper loans and misleading
advertising.

	   Worker Walkouts Hit Low in 1999
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of major strikes by American
workers hit a record low of 17 in 1999. Last year's big labor
disputes idled about 73,000 workers for an average of 16 days each,
the Labor Department said today. The agency's Bureau of Labor
Statistics has been keeping a count since 1947 of strikes involving
1,000 or more workers and lasting at least one shift. The previous
record low of 29 strikes was set in 1997. In 1998, there were 34
walkouts involving 387,000 workers. The largest strikes involved
12,000 workers at casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., and 11,000
teachers each in Detroit and Washington state.

	   PLANO, Texas (AP) -- J.C. Penney Co. Inc. plans to close about 45
department stores and 289 Eckerd drug stores in an effort to turn
the troubled retailer around. Company officials said today that
most of the closures will occur by midyear, but they declined to
say which of its 1,150 department stores and 2,900 Eckerds will
close or how many jobs will be lost. The Plano-based store and
catalog retailer also announced that it lost $12 million in the
quarter ended Jan. 29. The 8-cents-per-share loss compared with a
gain of $207 million, or 77 cents a share, in the same period a
year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Black Secret Service Agents Sue  </HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Secret Service blocks many black agents, including
some who guard the president, from promotion to senior management positions,
three black agents alleged in a discrimination complaint filed Thursday with the
agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The agents -- all of whom have worked on details protecting President
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore -- cite a pattern of discrimination involving
performance evaluations, assignments, training, promotions, transfers and ``a
racially hostile work environment.''
</P>
<P>
	   They are seeking an official agency finding that their rights have been
violated and an order barring the Secret Service from any form of
discrimination. Lawyers for the three said they hope that most of the 200 black
agents will eventually join the complaint.
</P>
<P>
	   The Secret Service, which has about 200 black agents among its 2,500-member
force, said it was ``very surprised'' at the complaint although it declined
comment on the specific allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will say that we take any allegation of racial discrimination very
seriously,'' Secret Service spokeswoman Chaun Yount said. ``As an agency we are
actively engaged in a diversity program to encourage a diverse work environment
and to provide each one of our employees equal opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
	   The agency's equal opportunity office is handling the complaint and will
make the initial assessment of it. Elements of it could eventually be considered
by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a federal lawsuit could be
filed if the complaints are not first resolved by negotiation or administrative
action.
</P>
<P>
	   Although some top Secret Service officials are black, the complaint alleges
many black agents who also are qualified are effectively blocked from
advancement into the agency's top jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   John P. Relman, one of the agents' lawyers, said at a news conference there
is no evidence either Clinton or Gore were involved in the alleged
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We call for the direct intervention of the president or the vice president
to assure that these practices are investigated and are stopped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   One agent, Reginald G. Moore, said that after being assigned to a lead
position in the president's protective detail, he was denied a promotion,
directed to train the white agent promoted ahead of him, and then transferred to
the Secret Service field office in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	   Added Yvette Summerour, now a member of the president's protective detail
who has also helped guard first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Chelsea Clinton:
``I wonder why I can't break through. I always get near the top, and then I
can't get anywhere else.''

<HEADLINE> Govt's False Claim Recoveries Rise  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Since the False Claims Act was amended in 1986 to
encourage private whistleblowers, more than $3.5 billion has been recovered from
companies that allegedly defrauded the government, almost half in the last 2 1/2
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost half of these false claims cases and more than half of the recovered
money involve health care fraud, which has burgeoned in recent years, the
Justice Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   During this period, the government has turned over $550 million of the total
recoveries to the private whistleblowers who first complained that their
companies were defrauding the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   The False Claims Act allow private citizens, known as ``relators,'' to file
civil lawsuits on behalf of the United States alleging that private companies --
usually their employer -- have submitted fraudulent claims for government
payments.
</P>
<P>
	   The private whistleblowers who file these so-called qui tam lawsuits are
given 15 to 25 percent of any money won in settlement or judgment if the federal
government intervenes in the case and takes over as the plaintiff. The private
whistleblowers can be given up to 30 percent of the money recovered if the
government does not join the case, but they pursue it to victory on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   Private whistleblower provisions were first added to the False Claims Act in
1976, but in 1986, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Rep. Howard L. Berman,
D-Calif., sponsored amendments that made it easier for whistleblowers to benefit
from their actions.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the 1986 amendments, there was no minimum in the law, like the
current 15 percent, for sharing the recovered money with the whistleblowers.
Judges set the amount and gave some whistleblowers nothing. The amendments also
relaxed a provision that had precluded whistleblowers from sharing in the
recovery if there had been any information whatsoever about the fraud in
government files before the lawsuit, even if it was not even information to act.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It took us 12 years -- the end of fiscal year 1998 -- to recover $2
billion in civil fraud cases brought under the whistleblower provisions,'' said
Acting Attorney General David W. Ogden, head of the department's civil division.
``We have reached the $16 billion mark just 16 months later.''
</P>
<P>
	   More than 3,000 such lawsuits have been filed since 1986, rising from 33 in
the year after the amendments to 483 in the last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the recoveries, more than $3.3 billion has come in cases the Justice
Department entered, and $211 million in cases tried by whistleblowers after the
department declined to enter.
</P>
<P>
	   The law's private whistleblower provisions ``have provided a remarkable
return for the taxpayers of this country,'' Ogden said. The department's
recovery of more than $3.3 billion ``demonstrates that the public-private
partnership encouraged by the statute works and is an effective tool in our
continuing fight against the fraudulent use of public funds.''
</P>
<P>
	   Recent recoveries include $375 million, the largest civil recovery in a
health care fraud case, from National Medical Care, now also known as Fresenius
Medical Care, North America, the largest provider of kidney dialysis services in
the nation. A private whistleblower alleged the company submitted false claims
for laboratory tests and conspired to pay illegal kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Beverly Enterprises Inc., the nation's largest operator of nursing homes,
agreed to pay $170 million to settle allegations it defrauded Medicare by
fabricating records to make it appear nurses were devoting much more time to
Medicare patients than they actually did.
</P>
<P>
	   Olsten Corp. paid $40.9 million to settle allegations that it and
Columbia/HCA disguised unallowable acquisition costs as allowable management
fees when Columbia/HCA bought home health agencies in several states.
</P>
<P>
	   False claim whistleblowing is not confined to health care fraud. Recently,
Chevron Corp. agreed to pay $86.2 million to resolve allegations it and its
affiliates underpaid royalties for oil produced on leased federal and Indian
land since 1988. Mobil Oil Corp. agreed to pay $45 million, and Oxy-USA Inc.
paid $7.3 million to resolve similar royalty underpayment claims.

<HEADLINE> Lott Opposes Jurist Nomination  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said Thursday he will
oppose the nomination of a Hispanic jurist whose appointment to the appeals
court has languished in the Republican-controlled Senate for more than four
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats said President Clinton agreed to telephone wavering Republicans in
search of support for District Judge Richard A. Paez.
</P>
<P>
	   The twin disclosures underscored the political stakes involved in the fate
of the Paez. A vote is expected by March 15.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will be voting against Judge Paez,'' Lott, R-Miss., told reporters in a
brief interview outside the Senate chamber. He said be believes the 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals does not need additional judges at this time.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond that, he said he would oppose the nomination because ``some of his
rulings and some of his political activities while on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lott ``has voted against nominations before,'' countered Sen. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif., who is leading the effort to confirm Paez in the Senate. ``The most
important thing is that we get the vote,'' she said, and predicted there would
be enough support to elevate Paez to the appeals court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every Democrat is already in favor'' of Paez, she said, and Clinton is
``concentrating on Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate, meaning that Democrats must
win the votes of five Republicans to assure confirmation. Two GOP lawmakers,
Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Orrin Hatch of Utah, chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, voted for Paez when the panel approved his nomination last
summer.
</P>
<P>
	   The nomination has become exhibit A in the Democratic catalogue of
complaints that Republicans have dragged their feet on Clinton's judicial
appointments. In addition, it has become intertwined with Democratic attempts to
depict the GOP as hostile to the interests of Hispanics -- allegations that
Republican protest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some people don't want these folks on the court,'' Clinton told an
audience of Hispanic leaders recently at the White House, referring to his
appointments of Paez and two other Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They don't want you to know they don't want them on the court, because
then you might not want them in the Senate,'' Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not rocket science. This is what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
	   Paez' supporters note he won confirmation once before as a federal judge,
and point to numerous expressions of praise for his work from attorneys. He
holds a ``well-qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association, its highest
grade.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservatives argue that the 9th Circuit has become a haven for judicial
activism, which they oppose, and that Paez himself has made questionable rulings
and remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   Some conservatives cite a speech in 1995 that they claim was critical of a
ballot proposition relating to affirmative action and a separate issue relating
to federal assistance for illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
	   A ruling in a 1998 case also angered conservatives, who claim Paez became
the first judge in the country to hold that an American corporation doing
business overseas could be held liable for human rights abuses committed by a
foreign government.
</P>
<P>
	   Paez' supporters take issue with that interpretation and say he was simply
making a procedural ruling as required under a precedent established by the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Paez, a federal district court judge, was first nominated to the appeals
court in January 1996. The Judiciary Committee held a hearing but no action was
taken, and the nomination expired when Congress adjourned at year's end.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton renominated Paez in January 1997, and the Judiciary Committee
approved the appointment by voice vote in March 1998, although six Republicans
indicated their opposition. No Senate vote was taken, and again the nomination
expired when Congress adjourned at year's end.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton nominated Paez for a third time in January 1999. The Judiciary
Committee sent the nomination to the floor in July on a vote of 10-8.
</P>
<P>
	   Paez' appointment aside, the Senate took action during the day on two
uncontroversial nominations. By votes of 98-0, it confirmed George B. Daniels as
a District Judge for the Southern District of New York and Kermit Bye as U.S.
Circuit Judge of the Eighth Circuit.

<HEADLINE> Senate Targets Russian Aid to Iran  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Following suit with the House, the Senate on Thursday
voted unanimously to step up efforts to stop Russia and other countries from
supplying Iran with weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters said the bill was necessary despite the ascendance of reformers
in the Tehran government. ``Fresh breezes of change are blowing through Iran,''
said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. But he said those changes have not reached
the highest levels of government ``who unfortunately have made Iran a pariah
state.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 98-0 Senate vote followed a 419-0 House vote last September on a
slightly different version. The House is expected to adopt the Senate bill and
send it to the president.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House threatened to veto the House bill, saying it complicated
international nonproliferation efforts, but congressional sources said the
administration was satisfied with changes in the Senate bill giving the
president more flexibility in imposing sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said the issue
was at the top of the U.S.-Russia agenda and ``we believe we have all the tools
we need to address the problem of proliferation to Iran. Therefore, additional
legislation is not necessary.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if the president would sign the Senate bill, Leavy said, ``We'll see
where the legislative process takes us.''
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation, unlike a previous bill that President Clinton did veto in
1998, does not require the president to impose sanctions against Russia and
others that supply missiles or weapons to Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   It directs the president to submit reports to Congress every six months
identifying foreign persons or countries that transfer weapons material or
technology to Iran and authorizes him to impose sanctions if he so chooses.
</P>
<P>
	   It does make payments to the Russian space agency in conjunction with work
on the International Space Station contingent upon the president's concluding
that Russia is complying with nonproliferation policies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This sends a clear message to Russia that they must do more'' to stop the
flow of weapons and nuclear technology to Iran, said Senate Majority Trent Lott,
R-Miss., a chief sponsor of the bill with Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
	   Lieberman said the bill was also a message to the administration that
``relations with Russia are not more important than our national security.''
</P>
<P>
	   Russia has actively assisted Iran in its nuclear power program, which the
United States fears is being used to cover up secret efforts to build nuclear
weapons, and China and North Korea have helped Iran produce ballistic missiles
now thought to have a range of at least 800 miles.
</P>
<P>
	   After the 1998 veto, the administration moved on its own to announce
sanctions on seven Russian entities suspected of transferring weapons technology
to Iran. In 1999 three more Russian groups were added to the list.
</P>
<P>
	   But Lott said this had not done enough to stop the flow of weapons
technology. He said that with enactment of the bill, ``we hope the
administration will use it to our country's advantage and impose sanctions.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Medicare Plan Attacked  </HEADLINE>
   By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration renewed its criticism of a
Medicare overhaul plan favored by Senate Republicans, saying it would
substantially increase out-of-pocket costs for retirees.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan could drive Medicare premiums up by as much as 47 percent -- not
including extra charges for a new prescription drug benefit, according to a
letter from Health and Human Services Department actuary Richard Frost.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter, dated Feb. 23, arrived in time for Democratic lawmakers to
distribute it at a Senate Finance Committee hearing Thursday, where the
legislation was under discussion.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., cosponsor of the bill with Rep. John Breaux,
D-La., called the letter ``just a continuation of the administration's
disinformation campaign on Breaux-Frist, which is the only proposal that
provides both outpatient prescription drugs and true Medicare reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   Frist and Breaux served last year on a bipartisan Medicare reform
commission, where the plan they are now peddling did not win enough support from
Democrats to be formally recommended to Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton has since come out with his own Medicare plan, featuring a
new prescription drug benefit providing $1,000 worth of coverage annually at a
cost to retirees of $26 per month.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans have criticized Clinton's plan as an attempt to score political
points for Democrats without seriously tackling the tough problems of curbing
Medicare costs, which are expected to balloon once baby boomers begin to retire
in about a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   The Breaux-Frist plan would seek to save the government money by making
Medicare more like the health benefits many younger Americans get from
employers.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior citizens would choose among pre-approved private health plans and
Medicare would pay a standard portion of the premium. Those choosing higher-cost
plans would pay more out-of-pocket, but supporters say competition among plans
would bring costs down for many.
</P>
<P>
	   A government-run Medicare option would continue to be available. But it
would have to compete under the same financial constraints as private plans.
</P>
<P>
	   For that reason, Foster said in his letter that staying in the
government-run plan -- which would be most similar to what retirees are used to
now -- could cost 25 percent more out-of-pocket.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Foster's letter noted that the Breaux-Frist legislation calls
for money from premiums collected from Medicare beneficiaries to cover 12
percent of Medicare's total costs. Under current law, premiums are scheduled to
cover about 10 percent of costs in 2003, 11 percent by 2010, and in 2015, the
program would run short of cash.
</P>
<P>
	   A boost to premiums covering 12 percent of costs in 2003 would translate
into a 22 percent rise in premiums, Foster estimated. Monthly Medicare premiums
are currently $45.50 per month.
</P>
<P>
	   Those choosing new prescription drug coverage offered under the Breaux-Frist
proposal would pay an additional charge, which Foster estimated at about $57.50
per month.

<HEADLINE> Durable Goods Orders Fall in Jan.  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Slackening demand for airplanes and electronics caused
orders for big-ticket goods to dip last month, but the fall isn't a big setback
for U.S. manufacturers, which continue to possess a lot of momentum, economists
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Orders to U.S. factories for durable goods -- items expected to last at
least three years -- slipped 1.3 percent in January to a seasonally adjusted
$214.8 billion, the Commerce Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with the decline, overall durable-goods orders last month were still
6.5 percent higher than January 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   "The real story is that American manufacturing interests are sustaining the
momentum of a freight train going full bore," said KeyCorp economist Ken
Mayland.
</P>
<P>
	   January's performance, not as weak as the 2 percent drop many analysts were
predicting, followed a breakneck 6.3 percent increase in December, the strongest
pace in seven years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve has nudged up interest rates four times since June to
slow the economy and keep inflation under control. Although that has made
borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, economists believe the
economy continues to grow at a too rapid pace that probably can't be sustained
without triggering inflation. Given that, many economists widely expect the
central bank to raise rates again March 21.
</P>
<P>
	   Fears of higher interest rates caused blue-chip stocks on Wall Street to
swoon. The Dow Jones closed down 133.10 points to 10,092.63.
</P>
<P>
	   "Higher interest rates have not yet tempered factory activity," said Merrill
Lynch economist Stan Shipley.
</P>
<P>
	   Strong business and consumer spending is stoking the sizzling economy. On
Friday, the government will release a revised estimate for the economy's growth
in the last three months of 1999 and many economists believe it will be much
stronger than the 5.8 percent rate the government initially estimated.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite January's decline in durable-goods orders, manufacturers have put
the darkest days of a global financial crisis that struck in 1997 behind them,
economists said. The crisis severely depressed foreign demand for U.S. goods.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gordon Richards, economist for the National Association of
Manufacturers, said January's report may be the first sign that the "long
awaited slow down in the economy is beginning to emerge."
</P>
<P>
	   The Commerce Department said orders for electronic and other electrical
equipment including semiconductors, circuit boards, telecommunications equipment
and home appliances, fell 13.2 percent, the steepest drop since July 1997. In
December, these orders rose by 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Transportation equipment orders declined by 3.6 percent as decreases in
shipbuilding, tanks, airplanes and aircraft parts more than offset increases in
orders for cars and railroad equipment. Transportation orders rose by a whopping
23.2 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
	   This category is often volatile from month to month because it includes such
big purchases as airplanes. Excluding transportation, overall orders fell last
month by 0.5 percent, the first decline since October.
</P>
<P>
	   Weaker demand for transportation and electronic products offset big gains
elsewhere in the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Orders for industrial machinery, including computers and machine tools,
jumped by 12.3 percent last month, the strongest pace since February 1985. In
December, these orders fell by 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Primary metal orders, the category that includes steel, increased by 1.7
percent in January, following a 0.5 percent decline the month before.
</P>
<P>
	   Shipments of big-ticket goods, a good signal of current demand, grew by a
solid 2.8 percent in January, marking the eighth increase in the last nine
months.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment
benefits last week fell by 7,000 to 278,000, suggesting that employers continue
to have trouble finding workers to fill job openings.
</P>
<P>
	   In another report, the volume of help-wanted advertising in major U.S.
newspapers edged up in January, the Conference Board said. Its index, which is
used as a gauge of changes in job supply, rose to 89 from 86 and suggests that
the nation's unemployment rate could dip this spring below the current 30-year
low of 4 percent.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- CNN is expanding its presence on the West Coast, adding a
bureau in Seattle and forming partnerships with business publications, in an
attempt to more aggressively cover the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps the most visible change is the move of CNN "Moneyline" anchor Willow
Bay to Los Angeles. She will anchor the show there each night, while co-anchor
Stuart Varney stays in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Bay's husband, Robert Iger, just got a job as second-in-command at the
California-based Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
	   The cable financial news network CNNfn is creating a new economy unit with
reporters in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. It will launch a one-hour
weekday program, airing at 5 p.m. ET starting next month, called "The N.E.W.
(New Economy Watch) Show" to focus on the high-tech economy.
</P>
<P>
	   CNN will also work with new print partners The Industry Standard and
eCompany Now, both based in San Francisco, as well as Fortune and The Financial
Times, the network said on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Lott Opposes Jurist Nomination  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Judge Richard Paez, nearing an appeals court confirmation
vote after a four-year delay, drew the opposition of Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott on Thursday while Democrats said President Clinton will lobby
wavering Republicans on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   The twin disclosures underscored the stakes involved in the fate of the
Hispanic jurist, who has been at the center of a lengthy dispute involving
racial politics as well as a long-running struggle between the White House and
the GOP-controlled Senate. A vote is expected by March 15.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will be voting against Judge Paez,'' Lott, R-Miss., told reporters in a
brief interview outside the Senate chamber. He said be believes the 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals does not need additional judges at this time.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond that, he said he would oppose the nomination because ``some of his
rulings and some of his political activities while on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lott ``has voted against nominations before,'' countered Sen. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif., who is leading the effort to confirm Paez in the Senate. ``The most
important thing is that we get the vote,'' she said, and predicted there would
be enough support to elevate Paez to the appeals court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every Democrat is already in favor'' of Paez, she said, and Clinton is
``concentrating on Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate, meaning that Democrats must
win the votes of five Republicans to assure confirmation. Two GOP lawmakers,
Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Orrin Hatch of Utah, chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, voted for Paez when the panel approved his nomination last
summer.
</P>
<P>
	   The nomination has become exhibit A in the Democratic catalogue of
complaints that Republicans have dragged their feet on Clinton's judicial
appointments. In addition, it has become intertwined with Democratic attempts to
depict the GOP as hostile to the interests of Hispanics -- allegations that
Republicans protest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some people don't want these folks on the court,'' Clinton told an
audience of Hispanic leaders recently at the White House, referring to his
appointments of Paez and two other Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They don't want you to know they don't want them on the court, because
then you might not want them in the Senate,'' Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not rocket science. This is what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
	   Paez' supporters note he won confirmation once before as a federal judge,
and point to numerous expressions of praise for his work from attorneys. He
holds a ``well-qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association, its highest
grade.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservatives argue that the 9th Circuit has become a haven for judicial
activism, which they oppose, and that Paez himself has made questionable rulings
and remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   Some conservatives cite a speech in 1995 that they claim was critical of a
ballot proposition relating to affirmative action and a separate issue relating
to federal assistance for illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
	   A ruling in a 1998 case also angered conservatives, who claim Paez became
the first judge in the country to hold that an American corporation doing
business overseas could be held liable for human rights abuses committed by a
foreign government.
</P>
<P>
	   Paez' supporters take issue with that interpretation and say he was simply
making a procedural ruling as required under a precedent established by the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   John Czwartacki, Lott's spokesman, said the majority leader was also opposed
to confirming any judges for the 9th Circuit Court, which he said had proved
itself to be outside the ``mainstream'' and was frequently overruled by the
Supreme Court. Paez, a federal district court judge, was first nominated to the
appeals court in January 1996. The Judiciary Committee held a hearing but no
action was taken, and the nomination expired when Congress adjourned at year's
end.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton renominated Paez in January 1997, and the Judiciary Committee
approved the appointment by voice vote in March 1998, although six Republicans
indicated their opposition. No Senate vote was taken, and again the nomination
expired when Congress adjourned at year's end.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton nominated Paez for a third time in January 1999. The Judiciary
Committee sent the nomination to the floor in July on a vote of 10-8.
</P>
<P>
	   Paez' appointment aside, the Senate took action during the day on two
uncontroversial nominations. By votes of 98-0, it confirmed George B. Daniels as
a District Judge for the Southern District of New York and Kermit Bye as U.S.
Circuit Judge of the Eighth Circuit.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein: All Parties Must Disarm  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sinn Fein deputy leader Martin McGuinness said Thursday
any successful disarmament in Northern Ireland must include all parties to the
conflict, including militant Protestants who, he contended, have 150,000 weapons
at their disposal.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuinness expressed irritation at a news conference that the Irish
Republican Army is often cited as the cause of recent setbacks to the peace
process because it had not begun turning in its weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the 1998 Good Friday peace accord, which establishes the basis for
peace in the province, asserts that it is the ``collective responsibility'' of
all participants to work cooperatively to achieve decommissioning, or
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People think that the only guns that are causing problems are the guns of
the IRA,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We in Sinn Fein also have concerns about guns,'' he said, referring to the
weapons held by the outlawed pro-British loyalist paramilitaries and by the
British troops deployed in the province.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuinness served as education secretary of the power-sharing Northern
Ireland Cabinet that was suspended by the British government Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA's unwillingness to move on the disarmament issue led Britain to
withdraw powers from the four-party coalition, which had been formed in December
under terms of the accord. The coalition took shape after the major Protestant
party, the Ulster Unionists, agreed to work alongside the IRA-linked Sinn Fein
party in expectation that IRA disarmament would begin in response.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain is supposed to publish a plan for withdrawing troops and closing
army bases under terms of the peace accord. It has yet to do so, although it has
already withdrawn about 3,000 troops and closed several major bases.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuinness, who serves as deputy to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, is in
Washington to rally support from the White House and Irish-American leaders.
Also here are David Trimble, head of the Ulster Unionist Party, and Peter
Mandelson, the British secretary of state for Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuinness said suspension of the local government has left him alarmed
about the future prospects for the peace process. In his appearance, he used
such phrases as ``deep crisis,'' ``dire straits, and ``huge gulf of mistrust''
to describe the situation.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein, he said, is ``absolutely committed to making the peace process
work,'' and he cast doubt about the willingness of the Ulster Unionists to meet
Sinn Fein half way.
</P>
<P>
	   As an example, he said, ``Trimble has never been prepared to shake hands
with Gerry Adams.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also said Mandelson bears much of the responsibility for the setbacks
though his decision to suspend the local government despite what McGuinness
called Sinn Fein's ``new and significant proposal.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``What the British have done is totally and absolutely illegal,'' McGuinness
asserted.
</P>
<P>
	   Trimble, in an appearance Wednesday at Harvard's Kennedy School, defended
the decision to suspend the government and expressed confidence that the two
sides will find a way to restore a Northern Ireland free of violence.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Leader Criticizes Germany  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The World Jewish Congress sharply criticized Germany on
Thursday for the way it is handling negotiations on a compensation fund for
Nazi-era slave and forced laborers.
</P>
<P>
	   The German government and industry agreed in December to a $5 billion
compensation fund to pay people whose labor was used to help fuel the Nazi war
machine.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have the impression that the preconditions under which the money will
be made available are not justice and morality. It has to do with business and
bringing an end to something,'' Israel Singer said in an interview to appear
Friday in the Berliner Zeitung daily.
</P>
<P>
	   The fund was set up to head off class action suits in the United States, and
German firms want guarantees they will be exempt from further court action if
the fund finally starts operation.
</P>
<P>
	   After the latest round of talks last week in Berlin, negotiators said they
hope to reach final agreement on the fund at a meeting in Washington on March
7-8.
</P>
<P>
	   But the U.S. envoy to the talks, Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat,
said there was still disagreement on how to divide the fund among forced
laborers -- those deported from their home countries to work in factories and
other enterprises in Germany -- and slave laborers, those held under ``work to
death'' conditions in concentrations camps.
</P>
<P>
	   Singer told the newspaper that the manner in which the negotiations are
running are an insult to Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Germany cannot want that two groups of victims fight like hungry dogs over
a piece of raw meat in the same room,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he disagreed with the U.S. and German envoys who said there had been
progress in the drawn-out negotiations. ``It can't go on like this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   German President Johannes Rau apologized in December to the victims and
begged forgiveness on behalf of the German people.
</P>
<P>
	   But Singer told the newspaper that Rau should send a letter of apology to
the victims in the name of the German people and industry for the way the
negotiations have been handled.
</P>
<P>
	   Estimates of the number of people who could benefit from the compensation
fund run as high as 2.3 million, mostly non-Jews from eastern Europe. However,
many of them are in their 70s and 80s, and Eizenstat said after the last round
of talks he estimated that eligible survivors were dying at the rate of 1
percent per month.

<HEADLINE> Helms, Gilman Chide Mexico on Drugs  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairmen of the House and Senate foreign relations
committees accused Mexico on Thursday of unsatisfactory cooperation with U.S.
counter-narcotics efforts and said relevant U.S. laws should be applied against
that country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The situation is Mexico continues to deteriorate rapidly,'' said House
International Relations Committee chairman Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., and Senate
Foreign Relations Committee chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilman and Helms outlined their views to Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in a letter sent less than a week before the State Department is due to
issue its annual report on the counter-narcotics performance of drug transit and
drug source countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The process involves an examination of 26 countries, and those found not to
be fully cooperative can be subject to economic penalties.
</P>
<P>
	   In the letter, Gilman and Helms do not specifically ask that Mexico be
``decertified'' as non-cooperative but their respective spokesman said both
recommend that designation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The letter lays out the case for decertification,'' said Marc Thiessen, a
Helms' spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   The two chairmen said the Clinton administration has ``failed to apply the
law faithfully'' against Mexico for many years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We respectfully call your attention to the following salient facts:
Mexico's counter-narcotics efforts are hamstrung by over-centralized decision
making, by astonishing inefficiency and by rank and file law enforcement
corruption,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
	   They added that there has been ``no major progress in uprooting the drug
cartels that do business with virtual impunity in Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department declined immediate comment but Albright signaled a
month ago that Mexico will be fully certified this year as it has every year
since Congress ordered annual reviews of drug problem countries in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   During a visit to Mexico on Jan. 16, Albright said U.S.-Mexican cooperation
on drug matters was at a ``very good level.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our problems are not as much with each other as they are with those who
are trying to undermine what we are trying to do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   A 1999 State Department report on drug trafficking patterns worldwide said
well-entrenched trafficking organizations based in Mexico ``have built vast
criminal empires that produce illicit drugs, smuggle hundreds of tons of South
American cocaine and operate drug distribution networks across the continental
United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, 28 countries were evaluated by the State Department as part of
the certification process. Most countries were fully certified and a few were
decertified but were spared economic penalties on national security grounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Only Afghanistan and Burma were decertified without a national security
waiver. But economic penalties were not imposed against them because both are
already under comprehensive sanctions for reasons unrelated to drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Tribal Leaders Seek Budget Increase  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT KELLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's proposal to provide $1.2 billion more
for Indian health care, law enforcement and education is not enough to meet the
dire needs of reservation communities, tribal leaders and their allies in
Congress say.
</P>
<P>
	   Indian programs have been underfunded for so long that more money is needed
to bring them up to minimal standards, the leaders said Thursday at a meeting of
the National Congress of American Indians.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's proposal to boost spending on Indian programs to $9.4
billion, more than a 12 percent increase over the current year's level, ``does
not begin to address the Third World conditions on our reservations,'' Congress
President Susan Masten said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is only the first step to recognize the trust obligations and treaty
responsibilities to Indian Nations,'' said Masten.
</P>
<P>
	   Lynn Cutler, the top White House aide on Indian issues, and other
administration officials acknowledge the budget proposal won't meet all tribes'
needs, but say a larger increase might have trouble in the GOP-controlled
Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's still not enough to meet basic needs, but it's a good package to go
around,'' White House adviser Mary Smith, a Cherokee, told the tribal leaders
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said he would
welcome proposals for additional spending.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A billion dollars is nothing to laugh at, it's pretty good,'' Domenici
said Wednesday during a Senate Indian Affairs Committee hearing. ``But it may be
that somebody might want to put more (money) in, especially in school
construction.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's budget proposal for the nation's 2.4 million Indians includes $300
million for reservation school construction and renovation, more than double the
$133 million to be spent this year. The money would pay for six new schools,
mostly in Arizona and New Mexico, but would not erase an estimated $800 million
backlog in vital repairs and construction for Indian schools.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget also calls for $103 million in new spending on Indian law
enforcement, more than $60 million more for building and repairing reservation
homes and nearly $230 million more for the Indian Health Service.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Revive Economic Theme  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Waxing nostalgic about eight years' worth of his fiscal
policies, President Clinton on Thursday courted support for his plan to keep the
economy rolling along on the strength of the Internet and expansion into new
markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton went to the University of Pennsylvania to lay out his vision for the
economy before about 800 students, faculty and business leaders. He said he will
gather economists, CEOs and other experts at the White House on April 5 to
explore ``the big cutting-edge economic issues still before us.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to ask them to identify ways we can build on America's strengths
and deal with our continuing weaknesses,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president listed many factors for the nation's climb out of recession
during his time in office, such as low interest rates, falling unemployment,
increased private sector investments and consecutive years of balanced budgets.
But, he said, scientific and technological developments have been the biggest
factor behind economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It clearly would not have gone on as long as it has, and the way it has,
without the information technology revolution,'' Clinton said. ``So the next
question is, can we keep it going? And, if so, how? And can we spread the
benefits to people and places that have been left behind?''
</P>
<P>
	   As Clinton spoke, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled below 10,000. The
Dow finished down 133.41 at 10,092.63 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   After speaking, Clinton traveled on to New York for a pair of fundraisers
for the Democratic National Committee. He was spending the night at his family
home in Chappaqua, N.Y., and returning to the White House on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Philadelphia, Clinton returned to the setting where he discussed his
economic ideas as a candidate in 1992, a time he said was marked by deficits,
stubborn rates of unemployment and otherwise lackluster economic measures, even
though the nation was actually coming out of a recession that year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had some pretty basic ideas that all boiled down to my conviction that
there was nothing wrong with America that couldn't be fixed by what's right with
this country,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said taking advantage of investments in science and technology was one of
his highest priorities at that time, and the country has accomplished that
through explosive growth of the Internet, ``an economic transformation as
profound as that of the Industrial Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
	   Otherwise, he pinned the nation's progress on the ``responsible fiscal
policies'' of his tenure. But he also credited the ``good monetary policy'' of
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who he said has resisted knee-jerk
interest rate increases to stave off inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mr. Greenspan was able to look at the evidence of the new economy over the
traditional ideology,'' Clinton said. ``He was resisting that because he knew
something was going on, even though no economist could give him a model which
proved it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton made a pitch for open trade, arguing for allowing China entry into
the World Trade Organization and broadening U.S. presence in markets in Africa,
the Caribbean and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   He also advocated expanding into forgotten markets on U.S. soil, areas where
unemployment has remained persistently high, such as inner cities and Indian
reservations in Western states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In order to keep this economy growing, we have to find more and more new
customers,'' he said. ``If you can create new businesses, new business owners,
and new employees, who are also consumers, within our borders, that will grow
the economy without inflation. It will also fulfill our moral responsibility to
give everybody a shot at the American dream.''

</P>
<P>
	   ``Hitler was a very great man. He wasn't great for me as a black man but he
was a great German and he rose Germany up from the ashes of her defeat. ... Now
I am not proud of Hitler's evil towards Jewish people, but that's a matter of
record. ...
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now that nation called Israel never has had any peace in 40 years and she
will never have any peace, because there can be no peace structured on
injustice, thievery, lying and deceit and using the name of God to shield your
gutter religion under His holy and righteous name''
</P>
<P>
	   -- A 1984 radio broadcast in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   Of his remarks calling Hitler ``great'': ``Sure I called Hitler a great man,
but I added that he was a wicked man. ... The Bible calls Babylon great, but it
does not say Babylon was good.
</P>
<P>
	   Of his remarks calling Judaism a ``gutter religion,'' Farrakhan said he was
``referring to the actions of the state of Israel using God and religion as a
cover for what I said was lying, stealing, murder.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a victim of bigotry. ... Any white has unmitigated gall to call a
victim of white racism a racist.''
</P>
<P>
	   -- A 1988 speech in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would hope and pray that after the vilification of Louis Farrakhan is
over and done ... you will see me as a human being who is passionately concerned
not just for black people, but I am passionately concerned for this nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   -- The Washington Post, 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not the ugly fellow you would like to make people think I am. It's
necessary for the garbage to be cleared away so that a new and better
relationship can be structured between blacks and Jews.''
</P>
<P>
	   -- Newsweek, 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Their aim was and is to destroy the reputation and character of Louis
Farrakhan in the eyes of the world and ultimately to destroy the Nation of
Islam.''
</P>
<P>
	   -- Of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't own Hollywood. Who writes the plays, the songs that make us look
less than human? Do you mean to tell me that Jews have never done any evil to
black people? And if I point it out, does that mean that I hate Jews? ...
</P>
<P>
	   ``Were they involved in the slave trade? Yes, they were ... and to the
extent that they were involved, somebody has to bring them to account. And I
believe that has fallen on me.''
</P>
<P>
	   -- Newsday, 1994.

don't owe America a damn thing! It owes us!''
</P>
<P>
	   -- A 1997 Savior's Day speech in Chicago in which he said blacks should form
their own nation.

<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- In the first experiment of its kind in Latin
America, Bogota's residents walked, biked, roller skated or took buses and taxis
to work on Thursday. But they did not drive.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor declared Thursday an auto-free day to force people to think about
improving life in this traffic-choked metropolis.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	   From 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., private vehicles were barred from the capital.

	   At noon, he reported air pollution citywide was down 25 to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Free of the chaotic traffic, most Bogotanos were in festive spirits.
Thousands cycled for pleasure, while mimes, dancers, musicians and clowns
performed at intersections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Normally, it's like a war here in the morning,'' university professor
Alejandro Martinez said as he waited for a bus, the only means of mass transit
available Thursday in the Andean city of 7 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   Bogota traffic jams are notoriously nerve-wracking. It's been two decades
since a new artery was built in the city, which has neither a metropolitan rail
nor public bus system, something Penalosa is bent on changing.
</P>
<P>
	   Within two years, Penalosa predicted 20 percent of Bogota's commuters would
be riding a new $350 million public bus system scheduled for launch later this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   The car-free day -- which European cities including Paris, Amsterdam, Munich
and Rome have experimented with since 1998 -- was only the latest Penalosa idea
to encourage civic consciousness.
</P>
<P>
	   In August 1998, he imposed a license-plate restriction that barred Bogotanos
from driving to work twice a week during rush hour. He also widened sidewalks
and prohibited parking on a main shopping avenue, initially provoking the ire of
merchants but eventually winning people over.
</P>
<P>
	   Penalosa also bought an exclusive country club and polo grounds in the
city's affluent north and turned them into a public park.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics accuse the mayor, whose terms ends Dec. 31, of demagoguery and say
he has presidential aspirations.
</P>
<P>
	   But surveys show 65 percent of Bogota residents supported the car-free day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A new culture has been born for us Latinos who don't know how to coexist
with nature,'' said Carlos Munoz, a teacher accompanying some 100 students on a
4-mile trek to a private high school in the city's north.
</P>
<P>
	   Munoz expected another class of Bogotano would have a good day Thursday.
City buses are usually plagued by muggings, and there were far more than the
usual quota of business executives aboard on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's going to be a banner day for the robbers,'' Munoz chuckled.

<HEADLINE> Exiled Laos Prince Appeals to US  </HEADLINE>
   By FREDERIC J. FROMMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The exiled crown prince of Laos, whose grandfather was
toppled from power by communists after the Vietnam War, urged the United States
to try to negotiate a transition to democracy in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   Prince Soulivong Savang, heir to the throne, said the communists have turned
Laos into an economic and human rights disaster. Laotians living abroad ``have
asked the royal family to work towards a return,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Savang, 36, said he would be willing to preside over a constitutional
monarchy if that's what the people of Laos prefer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I had a chance to go back to Laos, the first thing I bring is
freedom,'' he said through an interpreter at a news conference. ``But this is
not going to be an easy task. Democracy has to be learned, and people have to
learn their rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   Savang's uncle, Prince Sauryavong Savang, the patriarch of the royal family,
acknowledged it's unlikely the communist government will cede power. ``But in
light of the disastrous economic situation in Laos right now, and the fact that
Laotians abroad are successful, we can go back and help rebuild the country,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The princes and other members of the royal family are spending the week in
the United States, seeking to put pressure on Laos, one of the few remaining
communist nations. The family, which lives in France, has scheduled meetings
with lawmakers and has an appointment Friday with officials at the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department declined to comment on the possibility of U.S.-brokered
talks with the Laotian government. A spokesman for the Laotian embassy rejected
the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The prince and the royal family don't have any importance in Laos
nowadays,'' said the spokesman, Mai Sayavongs. ``We are not interested in
talking or negotiating with the prince or any other organization that is based
in exile.''
</P>
<P>
	   The monarchy, which dates to the 1300s, shared power with the Communist
Pathet Lao on-and-off through the 1960s and '70s. The communists took complete
control in 1975 and sent the king and queen and other members of the royal
family to ``re-education camps,'' where they died.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, the Lao Veterans of America called on the Laotian government to
release the remains of the king and queen, as well as provide any information
about two missing Laotian-Americans, Michael Vang of Fresno, Calif., and Houa Ly
of Appleton, Wis.
</P>
<P>
	   Ly, who fought with CIA-backed forces in Laos during the Vietnam War, and
Vang disappeared last April while on vacation. They were last seen boarding a
boat on the Mekong River that divides Thailand and Laos.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Laotian groups and some members of Congress say the Laotian government
kidnapped, imprisoned and possibly killed the men. Laotian officials say they
know nothing of their whereabouts.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein: All Parties Must Disarm  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sinn Fein deputy leader Martin McGuinness said Thursday
any successful disarmament in Northern Ireland must include all parties to the
conflict, including militant Protestants who, he contended, have 150,000 weapons
at their disposal.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuinness expressed irritation at a news conference that the Irish
Republican Army is often cited as the cause of recent setbacks to the peace
process because it had not begun turning in its weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the 1998 Good Friday peace accord, which establishes the basis for
peace in the province, asserts that it is the ``collective responsibility'' of
all participants to work cooperatively to achieve decommissioning, or
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People think that the only guns that are causing problems are the guns of
the IRA,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We in Sinn Fein also have concerns about guns,'' he said, referring to the
weapons held by the outlawed pro-British loyalist paramilitaries and by the
British troops deployed in the province.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, after a meeting with White House national security adviser Sandy
Berger, McGuinness said he does not feel pressure from the United States on
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This really isn't about pressure, about applying pressure,'' McGuinness
said.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuinness served as education secretary of the power-sharing Northern
Ireland Cabinet that was suspended by the British government Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA's unwillingness to move on the disarmament issue led Britain to
withdraw powers from the four-party coalition, which had been formed in December
under terms of the accord. The coalition took shape after the major Protestant
party, the Ulster Unionists, agreed to work alongside the IRA-linked Sinn Fein
party in expectation that IRA disarmament would begin in response.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain is supposed to publish a plan for withdrawing troops and closing
army bases under terms of the peace accord. It has yet to do so, although it has
already withdrawn about 3,000 troops and closed several major bases.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuinness, who serves as deputy to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, is in
Washington to rally support from the White House and Irish-American leaders.
Also here are David Trimble, head of the Ulster Unionist Party, and Peter
Mandelson, the British secretary of state for Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuinness said suspension of the local government has left him alarmed
about the future prospects for the peace process. In his appearance, he used
such phrases as ``deep crisis,'' ``dire straits, and ``huge gulf of mistrust''
to describe the situation.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein, he said, is ``absolutely committed to making the peace process
work,'' and he cast doubt about the willingness of the Ulster Unionists to meet
Sinn Fein half way.
</P>
<P>
	   As an example, he said, ``Trimble has never been prepared to shake hands
with Gerry Adams.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also said Mandelson bears much of the responsibility for the setbacks
though his decision to suspend the local government despite what McGuinness
called Sinn Fein's ``new and significant proposal.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``What the British have done is totally and absolutely illegal,'' McGuinness
asserted.
</P>
<P>
	   Trimble, in an appearance Wednesday at Harvard's Kennedy School, defended
the decision to suspend the government and expressed confidence that the two
sides will find a way to restore a Northern Ireland free of violence.

<HEADLINE> Chasing Pleasure in 'The Wild Party'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    An AP Entertainment Review By MICHAEL KUCHWARA AP Drama Critic
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Who knew decadence could seem like such hard work? That's
the case at "The Wild Party," a strenuous new musical which opened Thursday at
off-Broadway's Manhattan Theater Club.
</P>
<P>
	   The party guests expend a great deal of energy in the pursuit of sex, drugs,
liquor and other adult amusements. Their efforts make for an unrelenting musical
that celebrates the idea of debauchery for debauchery's sake with grim
determination. After a while, such single-mindedness proves monotonous, despite
several attractive performances and an adventurous song or two by composer
Andrew Lippa.
</P>
<P>
	   This "Wild Party" is the first of two versions to open in New York this
season, with another arriving on Broadway in April. Let's hope the second
relaxes a bit and offers its festivities with a bit more style.
</P>
<P>
	   There's a high-pitched sameness to the MTC evening that director Gabriel
Barre and choreographer Mark Dendy have done little to alleviate. That's
surprising since the musical is based on Joseph Moncure March's 1920s poem, an
edgy ode to a hard-boiled decade where sharp, cynical humor often masked a sense
of loneliness. It offers a parade of creatures from Manhattan's high and low
lives who are more than a little desperate.
</P>
<P>
	   Lippa, who also wrote the book, concentrates on just a quartet of those
unhappy characters and uses the other partygoers for tawdry atmosphere. The
musical starts promisingly enough with an introduction to Queenie, a femme
fatale who sets the party in motion.
</P>
<P>
	   "Queenie was a blonde, and her age stood still, and she danced twice a day
in vaudeville," go the first lines of poem, and the musical, setting the scene
quite nicely.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a bit disconcerting, though, to watch a group of dancers, dressed in
black, then swirl around the stage in what appears to be a bargain-basement
knockoff of the stuff choreographer Bob Fosse did so well.
</P>
<P>
	   With a minimum of movement, Fosse knew how to sell sex on stage. Dendy's
dancers, though proficient, resemble arty gymnasts rather than erotic revelers.
</P>
<P>
	   Queenie shares an apartment with Burrs, a vaudeville clown with a terrible
temper and a penchant for beating the women who love him. She decides to give
the party as a means of getting back at the guy.
</P>
<P>
	   Her best friend Kate arrives with a new beau, a gentlemanly fellow named
Black. Partner-switching and the inevitable tragic consequences ensue.
</P>
<P>
	   If the tone of the party is enforced gaiety, the drink of choice for its
main characters seems to be gin and bitters, judging from Lippa's score. It is
ambitious and far-ranging, moving from jazz to contemporary pop that doesn't
sound out of place in this 1920s milieu. Fortunately, the four leads display
enough lung power to refloat the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
	   Julia Murney makes a fetching Queenie, sexy yet vulnerable. Brian d'Arcy
James captures Burrs' pathological jealousy. He is compellingly creepy. A
strident Idina Menzel pushes too far as the desperate Kate, overselling several
songs including a second-act opener "The Life of the Party," that practically
begs for a round of applause.
</P>
<P>
	   Most successful is Taye Diggs, as Black, who displays a low-key confidence
as the good guy trapped in a situation not of his making.
</P>
<P>
	   There are several musical diversions by other partygoers that prolong the
show rather than push it forward, although Alix Korey scores points as an
aggressive lesbian, singing an "Oh, where is the girl for me?" number that gets
most of the musical's few laughs.
</P>
<P>
	   Designer David Gallo's almost expressionistic setting of a cramped Manhattan
apartment occasionally splits apart, letting the performers make full use of the
wide, unwieldly MTC stage. This "Wild Party" could use even more opening up.
It's a cramped, strident celebration that doesn't allow theatergoers to have
much fun.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 133.10; Nasdaq Up 67.32  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks sank again in volatile trading Thursday,
sending the Dow Jones industrial average briefly below 10,000, but the Nasdaq
composite index hit a new closing high for a second straight day.
</P>
<P>
	   In a session punctuated by fears of higher interest rates, the Dow finished
down 133.10 at 10,092.63. The index had fallen as low as 9,942.78 before
bargain-hunters entered the market.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-dominated Nasdaq, which had been down about 50 points, closed
up 67.32 to 4,617.65, bringing its two-day increase to 235.12.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 7.26 at 1,353.43.
</P>
<P>
	   "These 100-to-200-point swings are now the norm and everyone takes them in
stride," said Larry Wachtel, market analyst with Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   The volatility that has defined the stock market in recent weeks is a result
of higher prices; because many stocks are expensive, a handful of Dow and Nasdaq
components can cause huge swings in those indexes.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time the Dow traded below 10,000 was Oct. 18, and its last close
below that milestone came April 6. The Dow is now down 14 percent from the
closing high of 11,722.98 it reached Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the Nasdaq has been growing in importance over the past year and
has dominated stock market headlines since late last year, analysts were
concerned by the Dow's drop.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one should underestimate the psychology of moving below 10,000," said
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. "When the Dow
dropping moves from the business page to the front page, it will scare some
investors ... and could lead to more selling."
</P>
<P>
	   Blue-chip stocks, mainly banks, drug companies and retailers, have fallen as
Federal Reserve officials said they intend to raise rates to reduce inflationary
pressures in the robust U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Rising rates are hurtful to the economy and the components of the Dow are
adjusting to that," said Wachtel.
</P>
<P>
	   Dow stocks, particularly retailers and banks, are heavily swayed by interest
rates because rising rates slow borrowing and consumer purchasing. With a series
of rate increases this year looking more likely, the Dow has fallen five out of
the past six sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is like 'Groundhog Day.' We know this story. We've seen it almost
every day," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries &AMP; Co. He
referred to the movie where the main character keeps living Groundhog Day over
and over again.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks, which have become largely immune to concerns about rising
rates, have spent much of 2000 rallying at the expense of blue chips. Investors
are increasingly more attracted by the computer, telecommunications and Internet
firms' promise of bigger profit gains.
</P>
<P>
	   American Express, down 8 1/8 to 130, and Wal-Mart, off 2 3/8 to 44 5/8, led
the Dow lower Thursday. But Intel rose 5 3/16 to 114 1/4 after an analyst
upgraded the chip maker's rating.
</P>
<P>
	   America Online, which had lost nearly half its value since announcing its
acquisition of Time Warner, rose 1 11/16 to 60. That caused Time Warner to rise
3 31/32 to 85 15/32.
</P>
<P>
	   Dell Computer, up 1 to 42 3/8 and 3Com, up 5 3/8 at 83, helped power the
Nasdaq. But the telecommunications business Qualcomm fell 7 3/16 to 139 11/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Composite NYSE volume totaled 1.45 billion shares vs. 1.20 million in
Thursday's session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.13 to 554.04, another
record.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.3 percent, Germany's DAX index
was down 0.7 percent, Britain's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 was down 0.9
percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Accused Spy Says Calls Were Innocent  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A U.S. immigration official charged with spying for Cuba was
denied bond Thursday after he told a federal judge he relayed supposedly secret
information only to protect a friend.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Magistrate Judge Barry Garber ordered Mariano Faget to await trial in
jail, citing the severity of the charges against him, the weight of evidence and
the fact that Faget admitted divulging information he believed to be classified.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say that on Feb. 11, Faget, 54, was given bogus information that
a U.S.-based Cuban diplomat was set to defect. Within minutes, Faget allegedly
went to his office, called a business associate with ties to Cuba on his
cellular phone, and told him ``a person we both know (is) ... one of the ones
working with the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Faget called the man from home and discussed the case in more detail,
the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities say Faget has been under investigation for a year. According to
court papers, Faget met with Cuban intelligence officials in Miami on at least
two occasions and contacted officials with the Cuban diplomatic mission in
Washington. One has been ordered to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget, a native of Havana who has been a U.S. citizen since 1963, is on paid
leave from his post as a supervisor in the Miami office of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to have my day in court to defend myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget told the judge that he called the business associate to protect him.
The associate, Pedro Font, 57, is a New York publicist Faget has known since the
1950s. Font was an associate of Faget's father, the head of an anti-communist
agency in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget and Font are also associates in America-Cuba, a company created to
promote business with Cuba once the U.S. trade embargo is lifted. Font hasn't
been charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors said Faget had no reason to warn Font he was in danger
and asked him whether he told FBI agents of his concern for Font's life. Faget
said he did not.
</P>
<P>
	   Edward O'Donnell Jr., Faget's attorney, argued that Faget would not benefit
from supporting Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba, because as long as Castro remains
in power, America-Cuba can't broker business deals there.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Curtis Minor argued against bond for Faget. He said authorities
found six passports and other identification cards in Faget's desk drawer,
indicating he might try to avoid the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has lied to his employer, lied to the FBI, deceived the federal
government, repeatedly lied to federal agents,'' Minor said. ``He's continued to
submit falsehood after falsehood.''
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing came a day after an American couple who were part of a Cuban
ring that spied on U.S. military installations and exile political groups were
sentenced to seven years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Linda and Nilo Hernandez pleaded guilty last year to being unregistered
agents of a foreign government. Three other people charged with being part of
the ring have been sentenced to prison terms between 3 1/2 years and seven
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Five others are scheduled to go on trial in May, while four have never been
captured.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Mixed As Tech Stocks Surge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Most government bond prices rose Thursday as investors
sought the safety of Treasury securities amid another day of losses for
blue-chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark long-term bond slipped late in the session, however, and ended
down for the day.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/32 point, or $1.56 per $1,000
in face value. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of price, rose
to 6.13 from 6.12 late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the long-term bond fell victim to another rally in technology
stocks. Some investors apparently decided belatedly to jump on the tech
bandwagon. So they took money out of government bonds and moved it into riskier
technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-focussed Nasdaq stock market climbed 67.32 to 4,617.65,
another record. Old line industrial stocks tumbled again, however, with the Dow
Jones industrial average slipping 133.10 to 10,092.63. Earlier in the day, the
Dow briefly dropping below 10,000 for the first time in more than four months.
</P>
<P>
	   Also hurting Treasurys was competition from a bevy of higher-yielding
corporate bonds that are being offered this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in the bond market, prices of short-term Treasury securities rose 
1/8 point to 5/32 point and intermediate maturities rose by 9/32 point to 13/32
point, according to Bridge Telerate.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.80 percent, with the discount
down 0.01 percentage point to 5.63 percent from Wednesday's 5.64 percent.
Six-month yields were 6.00 percent as the discount was down 0.01 percentage
point to 5.74 percent. One-year yields were 6.18 percent, with the discount
falling 0.05 percentage point from late Wednesday to 5.83 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, rose
to 5.75 from 5.68 3/4 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index of municipal bonds rose  1/4 to 92 11/16. The yield to
maturity of the index fell to 6.17 percent from Wednesday's 6.19 percent.

<HEADLINE> MTV Promotes Most-Played Video Ever  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- MTV is promoting a countdown and $1 million giveaway this
weekend celebrating the music video that's been aired the most during the
network's 19-year history.
</P>
<P>
	   Just don't ask how much that video, Peter Gabriel's "Sledgehammer," has been
played. MTV won't tell you.
</P>
<P>
	   MTV says its closed-mouth policy is a way to avoid alienating record
companies. It never tells how much it plays a video -- even one like
"Sledgehammer" that was made in 1986 -- to avoid anyone building a case that it
favors one artist or company over another.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's an incredible amount of interest in exactly how many times a video
gets played," said David Sirulnick, executive vice president for MTV news and
productions.
</P>
<P>
	   Video play, particularly on a popular MTV show like "Total Request Live,"
can make or break a disc's popularity. Video time is even more prized as the
number of opportunities for them to get played has shrunk over the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Nine of the 10 most-played MTV videos are from the 1980s, including the
first one ever played on MTV, the Buggles' "Video Killed the Radio Star." The
only 1990s video to make the cut was Pearl Jam's "Jeremy."
</P>
<P>
	   Other well-worn videos are the Aerosmith collaboration with Run DMC on "Walk
This Way" and Dire Straits' "Money for Nothing," a song about MTV.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sledgehammer" used stop-action editing and claymation, both innovative for
its time, to create some arresting images, Sirulnick said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The song also coincided with the peak of Gabriel's popularity and was hard
to categorize in any one genre, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It really was one of the most unique videos ... that had ever been seen on
MTV," he said. "It was one of those videos that people wanted to see again and
again."
</P>
<P>
	   To coincide with the one-millionth video to be played on MTV -- sometime
Saturday between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. ET -- the network will borrow another popular
TV idea. It will give away $1 million in the form of an annuity to a viewer.

<HEADLINE> Russian Police Investigate Banks  </HEADLINE>
   By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian police are probing the banks that allegedly helped
launder $7 billion through the Bank of New York, but have yet to determine the
source of the money, a top investigator said in an interview published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander Mikhailenko, the head of the Interior Ministry's department for
combating money laundering, said there is no evidence to back allegations that
some of the money funneled abroad belonged to the Russian mob or companies
trying to dodge taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tax evasion or laundering of criminal proceeds don't figure in the case
yet,'' Mikhailenko said in the interview in the daily Vremya MN.
</P>
<P>
	   Mikhailenko said the probe involves the Russian banks Flamingo, DKB and
Sobinbank.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are trying to find the sources of the money and conditions of their
transfer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bank of New York case, which began to unravel in August, entered a new
stage last week when a former Bank of New York executive and her husband pleaded
guilty to money-laundering charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Lucy Edwards, the bank's former Eastern European Division vice president,
and Peter Berlin admitted helping Russian bankers launder the billions through
accounts at the bank in order to avoid Russian taxes and cover up the money's
connection to crimes -- including money used as ransom for a kidnapping in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Mikhailenko said his department had cooperated with U.S. investigators who
came to Russia last fall to question some people in the case, and complained
that the Americans failed to provide any information about the testimony by
Edwards and Berlin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It means that we are carrying out our own investigation, while they are
carrying out theirs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The DKB and Flamingo banks have gone out of business, but two prominent
Russian banks that were linked to them, Sobinbank and MDM, are still operating.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander Mamut, a Sobinbank board member who later took the helm of MDM,
has denied any wrongdoing. He had close ties with former President Boris
Yeltsin's inner circle.
</P>
<P>
	   MDM released a statement Thursday saying it has had no dealings with either
DKB or Flamingo since 1996, when MDM briefly owned shares in both banks. Even
then, MDM's role in those banks didn't involve any say in their financial
activities, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, MDM acknowledged that in 1996 it regularly transferred
money to its account with the Bank of New York on behalf of Sobinbank. Sobinbank
at the time didn't have its own account with the Bank of New York and had to act
through MDM, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   MDM said it would invite an international auditor to confirm its
claims.

<HEADLINE> Marriott, Investors Reach Agreement  </HEADLINE>
    By KELLEY SHANNON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Thousands of investors suing Marriott over limited
partnerships formed in the 1980s have reached a tentative settlement under which
the hotel giant would buy back 120 Courtyard by Marriott inns for $372 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement, revealed in court Thursday, also calls for Marriott
International Inc. and Host Marriott Corp. each to pay $31 million to end
lawsuits involving certain limited partnerships aside from the Courtyard by
Marriott deals.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for both sides characterized the deal as a "win-win" situation
providing liquidity for investors and value in the form of hotels for Marriott.
It still must receive the formal approval of investors and the court.
</P>
<P>
	   Settling the case with these terms is preferable to a prolonged court fight,
said Arne Sorenson, executive vice president and chief financial officer of
Marriott International.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's old news," Sorenson said. "We're talking about something that happened
in the mid- to late '80s. We're glad to bring it to a close."
</P>
<P>
	   Lead plaintiffs' attorney David Berg estimated the number of affected
investors to be about 6,000 in six different limited partnerships.
</P>
<P>
	   "The sense I get is the clients are thrilled to have liquidity," Berg said.
"I'm thrilled with the settlement, and I think Marriott is and I hope it gets
done."
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement will result in a one-time, pre-tax charge of $30 million to
$40 million to Marriott International, Sorenson said, adding that after that
period it should have no impact on earnings per share. Host Marriott said it
would take a charge of between $40 million and $50 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of both companies fell in trading at 4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock
Exchange Thursday, with Host Marriott off 12 1/2 cents to $9 and Marriott
International down $2.31 1/4 to $27.37 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   Word of the tentative deal arrived just as attorneys were on the verge of
going to trial in one of the limited partnership disputes. Investors accused
Marriott of fraud and claimed the hospitality company sold hotel properties for
inflated prices, charged excessive management fees and presented inflated profit
projections.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement calls for Marriott International and Host Marriott, through
an unconsolidated joint venture, to acquire the Courtyard by Marriott I and
Courtyard by Marriott II limited partnerships for $372 million. The two limited
partnerships own 120 hotels, which are managed by Marriott.
</P>
<P>
	   The transaction would end those limited partnerships.
</P>
<P>
	   The two Marriott companies also would pay a combined $62 million to settle
limited partnership lawsuits involving two Residence Inn limited partnerships
and Fairfield Inn and Desert Springs limited partnerships.
</P>
<P>
	   "The settlement is a complicated business transaction that involves the
repurchase of 120 hotels from two limited partnerships relating to Courtyard for
significant amounts of money," Richard Hoffman, an attorney for Marriott
International. "But it's the repurchase of assets by the company, it's not just
a payment of money to the plaintiffs to settle a fraud claim."
</P>
<P>
	   The repurchase of the Courtyard by Marriott inns will mean a profit for the
investors, Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Each investor in the Courtyard by Marriott I Limited Partnership who put an
initial $100,000 into the deal in the late 1980s would receive about $135,000
after the hotels are sold and the partnership ends. That is above the $78,000 in
distributions the investors received over the life of the partnership.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Courtyard by Marriott II Limited Partnership, each $100,000
investment will see $147,000 after the hotel sale. Investors had already
received $72,000 in previous distributions.
</P>
<P>
	   The estimated amounts are subject to slight changes as details of the
settlement are worked out, attorneys said.

<HEADLINE> Gap Beats 4Q Earnings Expectations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Fourth-quarter earnings at Gap Inc. beat expectations,
helped by the retail company's rapid expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   For the three months ended Jan. 29, 2000, the company said Thursday that its
earnings were up 32 percent to $414 million, or 47 cents per share, from $314
million or 35 cents a share during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts had predicted fourth-quarter earnings of 45 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Gap fell 42 27/64 cents to $42.51 9/16 in trading at 4:30 p.m. on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-quarter sales rose 27 percent to $3.86 billion from $3.03 billion in
the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
	   Gap operated 2,932 stores at the end of the year, up from 2,428 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Millard S. Drexler, president and chief executive officer, praised Gap's
expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   "We also reached new customers and expanded market share by opening more
than 500 stores worldwide and broadening our brands online," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, which operates Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy clothing
stores, earned $1.13 billion or $1.26 per share the year, up from earnings of
$825 million or 91 cents a share last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales were up to $11.64 billion from $9.05 billion last year.

<HEADLINE> J.C. Penney To Close 45 Stores  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID KOENIG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PLANO, Texas (AP) -- J.C. Penney Co. Inc. plans to close about 45 department
stores and 289 Eckerd drug stores in an effort to turn the troubled retailer
around.
</P>
<P>
	   Company officials said Thursday most of the closures will occur by midyear,
but they declined to say which of its 1,150 department stores and 2,900 Eckerds
will close or how many jobs will be lost.
</P>
<P>
	   The Plano-based store and catalog retailer also announced that it lost $12
million in the quarter ended Jan. 29. The 8-cents-per-share loss compared with a
gain of $207 million, or 77 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Before one-time charges, including store-closing costs, per-share profit
fell nearly 40 percent, to 45 cents a share from 72 cents a year earlier.
Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected 47 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, Penney's stores have been battered by competition from
aggressive rivals such as Kohl's department stores and discount chains such as
Gap Inc.'s Old Navy.
</P>
<P>
	   Penney's stock has lost about three-quarters of its value in the past nine
months. In trading Thursday, shares of Penney were down 68 3/4 cents to $16.18
3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Penney said it will take a charge of about $530 million to close the
department stores and the weakest members of the Eckerd chain. The moves will
save up to $300 million a year, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Half a billion in restructuring is juicy, but I think it could have been
bigger," said Richard Church, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. "They've got
a number of underperforming stores that frankly needed to be purged."
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts had expected dramatic moves from new senior executives who have
joined Penney in the past few months, and they predicted that more changes are
in the works.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, the company announced a campaign to spruce up its stores and
centralize its merchandise ordering.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a long uphill climb. They face a difficult retail environment, and the
economy is probably going to create some headwind for them," Church said.
</P>
<P>
	   "They deteriorated over a decade, so it's not going to be an overnight fix,"
said Jeffery Edelman, an analyst with PaineWebber, who called the closings
"overdue."
</P>
<P>
	   Although the company remained tightlipped about which stores will close -- a
spokeswoman said they hadn't been selected -- chief executive James E.
Oesterreicher said the doomed department stores had $350 million in sales last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Almost all of these stores are operating at a loss," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 289 Eckerds to close are mostly small, low-volume stores that Penney
bought from other chains, Oesterreicher said. Selling or closing them will cost
the company $450 million in sales this year and $550 million next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In its earnings report, Penney said revenue rose 5.2 percent to $9.8 billion
from about $9.3 billion a year earlier. But, as the company had previously said,
weak holiday sales forced dramatic price-slashing that reduced profit in the
fourth quarter. Comparable-department store sales fell 1.4 percent and catalog
sales fell 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year ended Jan. 29, Penney said its net income was $336 million, or
$1.16 a share, down 43 percent from $594 million, or $2.19 a share the year
before.
</P>
<P>
	   Oesterreicher also said the company will proceed in the third quarter with
its delayed plans to sell 20 percent of the Eckerd chain to the public in a
tracking stock.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor: Kohl Withheld Arms Files  </HEADLINE>
   By TONY CZUCZKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Helmut Kohl's government withheld records on an arms deal
under scrutiny for possible kickbacks, a German prosecutor told parliamentary
investigators Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The contract for tank sales to Saudi Arabia is among several deals being
examined by a parliamentary committee set up to determine whether political
donations influenced decisions under Kohl, who was German chancellor for 16
years until 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Winfried Maier, a prosecutor in the southern city of Augsburg, testified to
the panel that Kohl's government rejected his 1997 request for minutes of the
Federal Security Council, a Cabinet committee that approved the tank sale. Maier
said the government told him the material was confidential.
</P>
<P>
	   The tank sale is an element in the campaign finance scandal that has
engulfed Germany's Christian Democrats since Kohl admitted in December that he
accepted up to $1 million in off-the-books donations in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   His refusal to name donors has fed speculation that the donations prompted
political favors by his government -- something Kohl has hotly denied,
particularly in relation to the tank deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The scandal has grown to include covert accounts at the federal and state
levels, large sums of campaign money from unexplained sources and millions in
fines for the party for false financial reports.
</P>
<P>
	   The arms sale emerged as a possible link in November with reports that
businessman Karlheinz Schreiber gave $500,000 in cash to a Kohl aide in 1991,
allegedly in connection with the tanks.
</P>
<P>
	   Schreiber, now living in Canada, is being sought by Augsburg prosecutors on
tax evasion charges.
</P>
<P>
	   In another business deal that has come under question, the leader of the
parliamentary inquiry asserted Thursday that Kohl must have known that crucial
files vanished while he was in office.
</P>
<P>
	   Volker Neumann cast doubt on statements by Kohl and his former chief of
staff that they were unaware of irregularities in records on the privatization
of the Leuna refinery in former East Germany, sold to France's Elf Aquitaine in
1994.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now that is hard to imagine,'' Neumann, a member of the governing Social
Democrats, said on German radio.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers are looking at the deal because of long-running suspicions that
kickbacks flowed to clinch it, a prestige project for Kohl after German
unification.
</P>
<P>
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's government, which took over from Kohl, has
cited gaps in the chancellery files on Leuna and has appointed a special
investigator to track down what happened.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the top Christian Democrat legislator on the investigating
committee said Thursday that six folders of copied records on Leuna had been
stashed in a high-security part of parliament's archive. Kohl's former chief of
staff, Friedrich Bohl, has said he never destroyed any files or gave such an
order.

<HEADLINE> U.N. OKs Troop Commitment for Congo  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Half a year after six nations and three rebel groups
signed a cease-fire on Congo, the U.N. Security Council on Thursday authorized a
5,500-strong observer force to monitor its implementation and lay the groundwork
for possible deployment of a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   The former combatants are already pressing for the United Nations to send
peacekeepers, but the Security Council first wants the opposing sides to honor
the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The 15-member council unanimously agreed to the U.S.-drafted resolution to
send 500 military observers, supported by 5,037 security troops and logistics
personnel. The group will verify that all parties are observing last summer's
cease-fire aimed at ending a 1 1/2-year war in Congo that has destabilized
central Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke has said the United States will not
provide troops but may provide logistical support. U.S. officials have not
elaborated on the type of support, but in past missions that has included
transportion and communications.
</P>
<P>
	   Many council members recognize that sending such a small mission to a
country a quarter the size of the United States with few roads and poor
communications may not be militarily effective but can be politically important.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Security Council has taken a critical step to help the Congo come to a
peace that its people so desperately need,'' said Holbrooke, who devoted his
presidency of the council last month to African issues. ``The time has now
arrived to act.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Congo observer mission is expected to cost around $500 million for the
first 12 months. Other peacekeeping operations will cost $1.56 billion for the
year ending June 30.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the fourth major U.N. peacekeeping operation approved by the
Security Council in eight months. It had already agreed to send 4,800 civilian
police to Kosovo, 11,100 peacekeepers to Sierra Leone, and 10,800 peacekeepers
and civilian police to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   The war in Congo has been called Africa's first world war. Russia's U.N.
ambassador, Sergey Lavrov, on Thursday described it as ``the largest conflict in
modern Africa.'' It has not ended despite the cease-fire agreement -- a point
reiterated by speaker after speaker.
</P>
<P>
	   Congo is backed by Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia. The rebels who took up arms
to oust President Laurent Kabila from power in August 1998 are supported by
Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
	   In Kinshasa, Congolese Foreign Affairs Minister Abdoulaye Yerodia complained
that the resolution didn't specifically name the ``aggressors'' and demand their
withdrawal. The resolution merely calls for the withdrawal of ``all foreign
forces.''
</P>
<P>
	   As recently as Wednesday, at a one-day summit in Lusaka, Zambia, the key
players renewed their commitment to implement the cease-fire quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   But Britain's Deputy Ambassador Stewart Eldon told the council ``the
situation on the ground does not look promising.'' He warned that increasing
ethnic tensions in the Kivu region in rebel-held eastern Congo threatened the
entire population and risked ``a humanitarian catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fighting must stop now,'' he said. ``International humanitarian law
must be respected.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under the resolution, deployment would be in phases and subject to
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's determination that the troops are safely able to
do their jobs. A senior U.N. official said the first observers could be deployed
within three weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Possible troop contributors include Pakistan, Jordan, Senegal and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States, Russia and many other countries stressed that the main
responsibility for achieving a settlement rests with the signatories to the
Lusaka agreement -- and their actions will determine the next steps by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
	   Lavrov underscored the council's general agreement that the United Nations
will not take measures to force the parties to a peace, or to force guerrillas
to disarm, even if peacekeepers are eventually sent.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation in Congo is so complicated, he said, ``that it would not only
be naive but dangerous to rely on its settlement by external forces.''
</P>
<P>
	   Participants at the Lusaka summit welcomed the expected deployment of U.N.
observers and urged the Security Council to quickly deploy peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   But the draft resolution gives no timetable for even considering a
peacekeeping force, saying only that Annan should make recommendations for
further deployment based on progress in implementing the cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke stressed that support for the U.N. observer mission did not
constitute ``prior approval'' for a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   Namibia's U.N. ambassador, Martin Andjaba, noting that it took the council
almost four months to adopt the resolution, called for speedy deployment of the
military observers and expressed hope that peacekeepers would soon follow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Over the years, the U.N. has brought peace to so many countries including
my own,'' Andjaba said. ``Expectations of the suffering masses in the (Congo)
for peace in their country are therefore high and rightly so. We should not let
them down.''

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market mutual funds
rose by $5.24 billion in the latest week to $976.78 billion, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose by $5.45
billion to $812.36 billion for the week ended Wednesday, the Washington-based
mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund assets fell by $210.1 million to
$164.42 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Assets of institutional money market funds rose by $1.31 billion to $702.51
billion for the same period. Among institutional funds, taxable money market
fund assets rose by $1.16 billion to $651.31 billion; assets of tax-exempt funds
rose by $153.6 million to $51.20 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Total money market assets stood at $1.679 trillion for the week.
</P>
<P>
	   Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.673 trillion to reflect
reporting errors and a change in the number of funds reporting.
</P>
<P>
	   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in the week
ended Tuesday to 5.23 percent from 5.22 percent the previous week, said IBC's
Money Fund Report, a trade journal published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial
Data Inc. The 30-day average yield rose to 5.19 percent from 5.16 percent, IBC
Financial Data said.
</P>
<P>
	   The seven-day compounded yield rose to 5.37 percent from 5.36 percent the
previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield rose to 5.32 percent from 5.29
percent, IBC Financial Data said.
</P>
<P>
	   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds held steady at 49
days, IBC Financial Data said.
</P>
<P>
	   The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading commercial
banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks in the nation's 10
largest markets showed the annual percentage yield available on money market
accounts remained unchanged at 2.09 percent as of Wednesday from a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp. said the
annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing checking accounts kept at
0.84 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.79 percent on six-month
certificates of deposit, up from 4.77 percent the previous week. Yields were
5.21 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 5.17 percent; 5.53 percent on 2 1/2-year
CDs, up from 5.45 percent; and 5.81 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 5.75 percent.

<HEADLINE> Govt's False Claim Recoveries Rise  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Since the False Claims Act was amended in 1986 to
encourage private whistleblowers, more than $3.5 billion has been recovered from
companies that allegedly defrauded the government, almost half in the last 2 1/2
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost half of these false claims cases and more than half of the recovered
money involve health care fraud, which has burgeoned in recent years, the
Justice Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   During this period, the government has turned over $550 million of the total
recoveries to the private whistleblowers who first complained that their
companies were defrauding the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   The False Claims Act allow private citizens, known as ``relators,'' to file
civil lawsuits on behalf of the United States alleging that private companies --
usually their employer -- have submitted fraudulent claims for government
payments.
</P>
<P>
	   The private whistleblowers who file these so-called qui tam lawsuits are
given 15 to 25 percent of any money won in settlement or judgment if the federal
government intervenes in the case and takes over as the plaintiff. The private
whistleblowers can be given up to 30 percent of the money recovered if the
government does not join the case, but they pursue it to victory on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   Private whistleblower provisions were first added to the False Claims Act in
1976, but in 1986, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Rep. Howard L. Berman,
D-Calif., sponsored amendments that made it easier for whistleblowers to benefit
from their actions.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the 1986 amendments, there was no minimum in the law, like the
current 15 percent, for sharing the recovered money with the whistleblowers.
Judges set the amount and gave some whistleblowers nothing. The amendments also
relaxed a provision that had precluded whistleblowers from sharing in the
recovery if there had been any information whatsoever about the fraud in
government files before the lawsuit, even if it was not even information to act.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It took us 12 years -- the end of fiscal year 1998 -- to recover $2
billion in civil fraud cases brought under the whistleblower provisions,'' said
Acting Attorney General David W. Ogden, head of the department's civil division.
``We have reached the $3 billion mark just 16 months later.''
</P>
<P>
	   More than 3,000 such lawsuits have been filed since 1986, rising from 33 in
the year after the amendments to 483 in the last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the recoveries, more than $3.3 billion has come in cases the Justice
Department entered, and $211 million in cases tried by whistleblowers after the
department declined to enter.
</P>
<P>
	   The law's private whistleblower provisions ``have provided a remarkable
return for the taxpayers of this country,'' Ogden said. The department's
recovery of more than $3.3 billion ``demonstrates that the public-private
partnership encouraged by the statute works and is an effective tool in our
continuing fight against the fraudulent use of public funds.''
</P>
<P>
	   Recent recoveries include $375 million, the largest civil recovery in a
health care fraud case, from National Medical Care, now also known as Fresenius
Medical Care, North America, the largest provider of kidney dialysis services in
the nation. A private whistleblower alleged the company submitted false claims
for laboratory tests and conspired to pay illegal kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Beverly Enterprises Inc., the nation's largest operator of nursing homes,
agreed to pay $170 million to settle allegations it defrauded Medicare by
fabricating records to make it appear nurses were devoting much more time to
Medicare patients than they actually did.
</P>
<P>
	   Olsten Corp. paid $40.9 million to settle allegations that it and
Columbia/HCA disguised unallowable acquisition costs as allowable management
fees when Columbia/HCA bought home health agencies in several states.
</P>
<P>
	   False claim whistleblowing is not confined to health care fraud. Recently,
Chevron Corp. agreed to pay $86.2 million to resolve allegations it and its
affiliates underpaid royalties for oil produced on leased federal and Indian
land since 1988. Mobil Oil Corp. agreed to pay $45 million, and Oxy-USA Inc.
paid $7.3 million to resolve similar royalty underpayment claims.

<HEADLINE> Bausch &AMP; Lomb Tries Laser Surgery  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN DOBBIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Just as prices for laser-eye surgery look set to
tumble, Bausch &AMP; Lomb Inc. is jumping into the competitive U.S. market with a
vision-correction machine it boasts is better than those of industry leaders
Visx Inc. and Summit Technology Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   The world's biggest eye-care company said Thursday it has gotten approval
from the Food and Drug Administration to sell its Technolas 217 excimer-laser
system, which is already the market leader abroad for treating both
nearsightedness and farsightedness.
</P>
<P>
	   Its emergence on the domestic front seems likely to intensify a price war
among providers of laser-eye surgery equipment and contribute to the drop in
consumer prices. Analysts predict as many as 1.7 million Americans will undergo
laser eye surgery this year, up from about 900,000 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Douglas Christopher, an analyst with Crowell Weedon &AMP; Co. in Los Angeles,
said he expects the price of the surgery to drop from an average of $2,100 per
eye to about $1,500 per eye this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Even if it went to $1,000 an eye, that's still a lot of money," he said.
"But I don't think Bausch &AMP; Lomb are in the market to become a low-price leader.
They're looking at it as a technological advancement, maybe more of a premium
product."
</P>
<P>
	   Laser eye surgery is rarely paid for by insurance because it isn't
considered medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
	   In the surgery, a beam of light is used as a scalpel to make the cornea
slightly flatter and allow light to focus on the image-sensing retina. The laser
removes minute layers of tissue with a dose of "cold" ultraviolet energy that
leaves surrounding tissue undamaged.
</P>
<P>
	   The Technolas 217 machines, which sell for $525,000 each, employ a more
precise laser beam that is just millimeters in diameter -- three times narrower
than standard broad-beam lasers, the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   In clinical studies, Bausch &AMP; Lomb said 99.7 percent of patients had their
vision improved to 20/40 or better, and 87.3 percent ended up with practically
perfect 20/20 vision or better.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology also diminishes the risk of patients ending up with
uncomfortable side effects, the company said. After surgery, some patients
experience a glare, which is described as long lines of light coming from a
point of light. Others see a halo, a ring around a point of light.
</P>
<P>
	   Bausch &AMP; Lomb said it will charge a $100 royalty fee for each use of its
system by doctors, matching the fee charged by Santa Clara, Calif.-based Visx
and Summit Technologies of Waltham, Mass. This week, Summit and Visx lowered the
per-procedure fee they charge doctors from about $250.
</P>
<P>
	   Bausch &AMP; Lomb said its laser-eye products account for about 10 percent of
its $1.8 billion in revenues. It said it commands about one-third of the
overseas market with 500 machines in place, and its next closest competitor is
Japan's Nidek Co. with 430 machines.
</P>
<P>
	   Visx operates an estimated 500 machines in the United States and 360
machines abroad, while Summit Technologies has 235 machines in this country and
170 abroad, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   Visx shares rose $2.44 to $18.75 on the Nasdaq Stock Market Thursday,
gaining back some of the heavy losses it incurred earlier in the week after
announcing the cut in its royalty fee.
</P>
<P>
	   Summit shares, which also fell earlier in the week, rose 19 cents to $8.
Both stocks are at or near 52-week lows. Shares of Bausch &AMP; Lomb gained 69 cents
to $59.19 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> AstraZeneca's Operating Profit Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- Despite strong demand for its anti-ulcer drug Prilosec,
AstraZeneca's fourth quarter operating profit slipped 1 percent due to heavy
wholesaler stocking earlier in the prior quarter, the company said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker had a fourth-quarter operating profit of $796
million, down from $806 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales rose 9 percent to $3.9 billion from $3.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Prilosec, sold as Losec outside the United States, accounted for nearly 39
percent of sales in the quarter. Prilosec, the world's best selling prescription
drug, posted a 14 percent increase in sales in the quarter to 1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of Prilosec, the world's biggest selling prescription drug, rose 24
percent in 1999 to $5.91 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   AstraZeneca was formed last April when Astra of Sweden merged with Britain's
Zeneca to form one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The company attributed the decline in fourth quarter sales to unusually
strong third-quarter sales, which took away some of the business normally seen
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   	   One-time costs of the merger of Astra and Zeneca cost took more than $ 1
billion off of 1999 earnings. AstraZeneca's net profit for the year was $ 1.14
billion, down 54 percent from $2.47 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Strong growth in U.S. sales contributed to an 11 percent increase in annual
operating profit, but one-time merger costs dragged down the company's 1999
earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   Annual operating profit before unusual charges was $3.91 billion, up from
last year's pro-forma result of $3.51 billion, the company said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   AstraZeneca posted $18.45 billion in sales last year, up 4 percent from
$17.79 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Pharmaceutical sales in the United States, AstraZeneca's biggest market,
grew 23 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the company's prospects are clouded by the expiration in October
2001 of the U.S. patent for Prilosec. It is not yet clear if AstraZeneca can
persuade enough doctors of the merits of Nexium, its next generation Losec. The
drug has not yet been approved in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   "They've had a cracking year," said Peter Cartwright, an analyst at London
brokerage Williams de Broe. "Losec is in a huge growth phase, and one or two of
the other drugs are doing pretty well.
</P>
<P>
	   "But can this current growth be maintained, and can they successfully switch
(doctors) to Nexium?"
</P>
<P>
	   AstraZeneca chief executive Tom McKillop was optimistic that Nexium would
win converts.
</P>
<P>
	   "From the reports we're getting back, the doctors see very real benefits in
faster healing, higher percentages of patients healed and economic benefits," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Swedish authorities dealt AstraZeneca a surprise setback by revoking its
patent for Losec in Sweden, the company confirmed Thursday. The company is
appealing.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. shares of AstraZeneca fell $2.62 1/2 cents to $31.50 in trading at 4:30
p.m. Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Experts Debate Popular Diet Plans  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Want to lose weight? Try following the back and forth of
the Great Nutrition Debate, a government-sponsored face-off Thursday of
America's leading diet gurus. The exercise was guaranteed to leave you
exhausted.
</P>
<P>
	   At one end was cardiologist Robert Atkins, promoter of the wildly popular,
high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet that lets people eat omelets, bacon and
bun-less burgers. "It's easy to follow. You're never hungry," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other: Dean Ornish, an internist whose book promises readers they can
"Eat More, Weigh Less" if they follow his ultra low-fat, virtually vegetarian
diet.
</P>
<P>
	   In between were people like heart surgeon Morrison Bethea, co-author of
"Sugar Busters! Cut Sugar to Trim Fat," who says the secret to losing weight is
cutting out not just sugar but also foods like potatoes and carrots that act in
similar ways.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, biochemist Barry Sears, who believes the answer to obesity is in
chemistry -- controlling the body's insulin level, and internist John McDougall,
who thinks it should be obvious to anyone that an Asian rice-based diet is best.
"This is a no brainer," he said .
</P>
<P>
	   Atkins vigorously defended his low-carb diet, which has been roundly
criticized by Ornish as well as many medical experts who fear it could damage
the kidneys or bones.
</P>
<P>
	   Atkins said that it is the fat and cholesterol produced by the body that is
the culprit in obesity, not the fat that's eaten. And not only does his diet
work, it's safe, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Not so, said Ornish.
</P>
<P>
	   "Telling people that pork rinds and sausage is healthy sells books, but it's
hazardous to your health," said Ornish.
</P>
<P>
	   In the sharpest exchange of the debate, Ornish criticized the lack of
research done on the effects of Atkins' diet.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not as good a fund-raiser as you are," Atkins snapped.
</P>
<P>
	   "With the number of books you sell you could fund your own studies," Ornish
fired back.
</P>
<P>
	   As for critics who say Ornish's low-fat diet is unappealing, he said that's
because they are not cooking the right way.
</P>
<P>
	   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who organized the debate and had the
final word, made no effort to sort out the myriad of conflicting claims.
</P>
<P>
	   "Eat well and eat healthy," he advised. But he suggested that it may be time
for government researchers get involved in evaluating the various diets.
</P>
<P>
	   There were some areas of agreement among the weight-loss experts: Americans
are too fat. Exercise is good. Added sugars and refined carbohydrates, like
white bread, are not.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond that, they couldn't agree on what causes people to become fat, much
less how to get rid of it.
</P>
<P>
	   "Balance is the key," said Keith-Thomas Ayoob, a spokesman for the American
Dietetic Association and a panelist for the debate. "We've gone to all the
extremes now. Maybe somewhere in between is where we need to go."
</P>
<P>
	   Diets can reduce weight, but the question is whether people can keep it off,
said Ayoob, a nutritionist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. "Big
changes are temporary changes."
</P>
<P>
	   One diet is not "appropriate ... for each and every patient," said another
panelist, Denise Bruner, president of the American Society of Bariatric
Physicans, the doctors who treat obesity. "Does a physician treat every stomach
ache with a pill?"

<HEADLINE> McCain supporter challenging closed primary structure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A John McCain supporter who previously was an
independent New York voter has now sued to be able to vote in the state's closed
GOP primary, and a federal judge will hear her arguments next week.
<P>
	   If Wendy Van Wie of Columbiaville wins her action, an extra 2.2 million
independent voters would be able to participate in New York's "Super Tuesday"
Democratic and Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of Texas Gov. George Bush's supporters in New York, including state GOP
Chairman William Powers, have come out against opening the state primaries to
independent voters. "I think the Republican primary should be for Republicans,
not Democrats and independents," Powers said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, McCain got major help from independent and Democratic voters in his
victories in New Hampshire and Michigan. "If they get a favorable decision, I
think we'll sweep New York," said former Congressman Guy Molinari, McCain's New
York chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Van Wie, 46, who previously had not registered for a political party in New
York, registered as a Republican after a federal judge on Feb. 4 ordered McCain
placed on the ballot statewide in New York. However, Van Wie, a recent Albany
Law School graduate, was told state law would keep her from voting in a New York
presidential primary until 2004.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters who switch parties or join parties after being uncommitted have to
wait until after a presidential election to participate in their new party's
primary. That means the first primary she would be able to vote in would be in
2004.
</P>
<P>
	   "I personally want to vote for John McCain," said Van Wie, who along with
Lloyd Wright of Dutchess County asked a federal judge to stop New York's
political parties from keeping independent voters out of their primaries. "I
don't really care who anyone else votes for, though. I just want people to be
able to vote."
</P>
<P>
	   Her lawyer, Susan Galvin, says unregistered voters in New York can wait
until at least 20 days before a primary and register for a party and vote in the
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   "The non-enrolled are treated clearly differently and in a discriminatory
manner from the way in which people who are not registered to vote at all in New
York are treated," she said. "If you haven't bothered to register or you haven't
bothered to exercise your right to vote in the past, you get preferential
treatment over somebody who is registered and has voted."
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari, Galvin and Van Wie all insisted Thursday that the McCain campaign
is not behind the lawsuit to get more independent support into the Republican
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge David Hurd on Thursday issued a temporary restraining
order keeping political parties from rejecting primary applications of
registered independent voters. He will hold a hearing on Tuesday in Utica to
decide whether the restraining order should become permanent.
</P>
<P>
	   Named in the injunction are Powers, Democratic Party Chairwoman Judith Hope,
GOP Gov. George Pataki, the state Board of Elections, the Columbia County Board
of Elections and the Dutchess County Board of Elections.

<HEADLINE> EU, Latin American Nations Seek Ties  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT WIELAARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) -- The European Union and 18 Latin American nations
pledged Thursday to pursue closer economic and trade ties, concluding three days
of meetings highlighted by discussion of two upcoming free-trade accords.
</P>
<P>
	   In a joint statement, foreign and trade ministers from the EU and Latin
America said they want to see a fresh round of world trade liberalization talks
after the failure to reach agreements in Seattle last November.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombian Foreign Minister Guillermo Fernandez de Soto told reporters the
meeting produced ``a degree of consensus to strengthen the multilateral trading
system.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Europeans endorsed the view of Latin American nations that to avoid the
sort of mayhem in the streets that forced the collapse of the World Trade
Organization's talks in Seattle, less developed nations must have a bigger voice
in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides said they want to see a comprehensive round of trade
liberalization talks that also cover agricultural subsidies and the service
sector.
</P>
<P>
	   During the talks, the EU and Mexico nailed down final details of a free
trade accord to be signed by Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo on the sidelines
of a March 23-24 EU summit meeting in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement will eventually give European companies access to the Mexican
market nearly matching the unfettered access U.S. and Canadian companies will
have by 2003 under the North American Free Trade Agreement. The accord with the
EU foresees free trade in industrial goods by 2007 and in farm products by 2010.
</P>
<P>
	   Representatives from the EU and the Mercosur nations of Argentina, Brazil,
Paraguay, Uruguay and Chile -- Latin America's best economic performers -- will
start negotiations in April for an association agreement that must eventually
include a free trade arrangement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Developing our relationship with Latin America is a real priority,'' EU
External Affairs Commissioner Chris Patten told reporters after the EU's three
days of back-to-back talks with Mexico, Central and South American nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Jaime Gama, the Portuguese foreign minister and the meeting's host, said:
``We are stepping up our relationship. Since 1998, we (the EU) have been the
largest investor in Latin America, and we are the region's second biggest
trading partner.''
</P>
<P>
	   The EU and Latin American sides also agreed to cooperate more in
international organizations such as the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Children's Traffic Deaths High  </HEADLINE>
   By JUSTIN BACHMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Little progress has been made in reducing the number of car
accident deaths among children ages 4 to 8, in part because drivers continue to
leave them unrestrained by any safety device, according to a government report
issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that from 1994 to
1998, 2,549 children in that age-range died in fatal car wrecks.
</P>
<P>
	   The report found that more than two-thirds were not wearing a safety
restraint, and fewer than half were sitting in the back seat, which is the
safest area for a child to be.
</P>
<P>
	   The death rate would be lower but for the fact that many children between
those ages are too big for child safety seats and too small for adult seat
belts, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC recommends that children ages 4 to 8 use booster seats so that
shoulder belts fit them securely between the neck and arm and the lap belt fits
across the upper thighs. Only about 5 percent of the children killed in
accidents were using booster seats.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal officials also recommend that any child under 12 years old ride only
in the back, which studies show could cut deaths by a third. But about a quarter
of all children routinely ride up front, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
	   Steven Trockman of the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and
Control, likened the problem to a disease in which a vaccine goes unused.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a known problem, we have a known vaccine for it,'' Trockman said.
``The vaccine is not getting to the children.''
</P>
<P>
	   While all states have child-restraint laws, the CDC also found wide gaps
among the safety measures mandated for children ages 4 to 8.
</P>
<P>
	   No state requires the use of booster seats, and 19 states allow children to
ride in the back seat without a restraint, according to the Insurance Institute
for Highway Safety, an Arlington, Va.-based research group funded by auto
insurance companies. Only 12 states prohibit the use of adult seat belts for
children.
</P>
<P>
	   Adults who let children's complaints about sitting in booster seats and back
seats override their better judgment also contribute to the problem, said Julie
Rochman, an institute spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The parents are not making good decisions,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Body of man found inside Manhattan restaurant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A man was found with his throat slashed Thursday inside
a Manhattan restaurant, a meat cleaver atop his body, and a 12-inch carving
knife at his side. Police were not certain if the items were used in the murder.
<P>
	   The scene was described as "pretty bloody" by Police Capt. Robert Iovino.
The victim had multiple stab wounds and was found in the rear of the restaurant,
in the kitchen area, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   No arrests had been made by Thursday evening and police did not comment on a
motive. Iovino said the victim had not yet been positively identified by family
members.
</P>
<P>
	   However, identification found on the victim showed that he was Nicola
Orobello, 62, of Flushing Queens, said a police source, speaking on condition of
anonymity. Business records showed that the Upper East Side restaurant - Erminia
- was owned by Orobello.
</P>
<P>
	   Two women identified by employees at the scene as Orobello's mother and wife
were described as hysterical as they entered the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
	   The victim was found at 11:30 a.m. when a linen delivery man discovered the
body as he pushed open an unlocked door at the East 83rd Street location, police
said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately known how long the victim had been dead. Police were
investigating whether he had been in the restaurant late Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Erminia, a 15-year-old restaurant, specializes in Italian cuisine. The
Zagat's restaurant guide describes it as a tiny, intimate hideaway with
excellent food "worth every penny for that much romance."
</P>
<P>
	   "At least one engagement" would occur per night, the guide added.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanley Poll, 60, was outside the restaurant Thursday and said he comes a
few times a year. He called Erminia a "romantic hideaway," and spoke highly of
Orobello.
</P>
<P>
	   "He made you feel like you were somebody special," Poll said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Walt Disney, lawyers top first lady's donors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Mickey Mouse has deep pockets when it comes to Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
<P>
	   Walt Disney executives and their families donated $56,500 to Clinton's U.S.
Senate bid, more than any other company. But as an industry, lawyers topped the
list, giving the Yale Law School graduate $666,879, according to an analysis of
the first lady's campaign filing by the Center for Responsive Politics. The
entertainment industry was next, donating $439,740, the nonpartisan center said.
</P>
<P>
	   The analysis also showed that some 56 percent - or $3.4 million - of
Clinton's $6 million in individual contributions came from outside New York.
Donations to Clinton's campaign poured in from 45 other states and the District
of Columbia, the center found.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can see that this really is a national race," the center's Executive
Director Larry Makinson said Thursday. "She's successfully tapping traditional
Democratic donors, like lawyers. The twist is how well she's connected to
Hollywood."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton drew $668,779 from California, topping all states except New York.
Of the $2.7 million she raised in New York state, $2.2 million of it came from
the New York City metropolitan area, the analysis found. Much of that cash came
from wealthy neighborhoods in Manhattan's Upper East Side, the data showed.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton received just $13,250 from her new hometown of Chappaqua, the
Westchester County town where she and the president recently purchased a $1.7
million home. Other heavy givers to Clinton were Massachusetts ($382,600), Texas
($312,824), District of Columbia ($276,940), and Illinois ($229,700), the center
found.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has been fighting the perception that she is a carpetbagger in New
York, where she had never lived or worked until launching her Senate bid. The
campaign of her GOP rival, Rudolph Giuliani, has also been receiving large
numbers of contributions from outside New York. But Bruce Teitelbaum, the New
York City mayor's campaign manager, attacked the first lady Thursday for
"running a campaign based out of California, Illinois and Massachusetts with
money from wealthy trial lawyers and movie producers."
</P>
<P>
	   Teitelbaum said that less than 50 percent of Giuliani's $11.5 million
campaign warchest has come from outside New York. Clinton raised a total of $8.1
million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The center's analysis of the first lady's fund raising found that more than
61 percent of her money came from individual donors giving $1,000 or more but it
only counted contributions of $200 or more. Individuals may contribute a maximum
of $2,000 under federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are very proud that the campaign has more than 58,000 contributors and
that their average contribution was $136," Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Makinson said he expected his center to conduct a similar analysis of the
mayor's fund raising when the data was available electronically from the Federal
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   The center's analysis included money raised by Clinton's Senate campaign
during 1999 and also included proceeds from joint fundraisers with the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to lawyers and entertainment executives, the analysis also found
that Clinton was popular with the securities and investment industry. Her
second-largest single donor company was Goldman Sachs Co. where executives and
their families donated $39,120. Clinton's other top donors also came from the
financial services industry: Deloitte and Touche ($28,750); Patton Boggs
($25,500) and Citigroup ($22,000).
</P>
<P>
	   While corporations cannot give money to candidates directly, political
action committees set up by them may contribute. So can executives within a
company.
</P>
<P>
	   Within Disney, most of Clinton's donations came from executives at Miramax,
which has produced such blockbusters as last year's Oscar winner for best
picture, "Shakespeare in Love."

<HEADLINE> Former Mafia hitman arrested in drug ring sweep  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PHOENIX (AP) - Former Mafia hitman Salvatore "Sammy the Bull" Gravano,
the mob turncoat whose testimony helped put crime boss John Gotti behind bars,
was charged Thursday with operating a statewide ecstasy ring, authorities said.
<P>
	   Gravano was arrested on one count of conspiracy to distribute dangerous
drugs, a felony carrying a 12 1/2-year prison sentence, said Arizona Attorney
General Janet Napolitano.
</P>
<P>
	   "His primary testimony against the mob doesn't give him a free ride to
facilitate drug dealing in Arizona," said Napolitano.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said Gravano bankrolled the ring and also headed its operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Gravano's wife, Debra, and other family members were also charged with being
involved in the ring, which police said distributed 20,000 to 30,000 ecstasy
pills a week in Phoenix and may have had links to other states.
</P>
<P>
	   Ecstasy is a hybrid of the hallucinogen mescaline and the stimulant
amphetamine chemically known as MDMA. It has been shown in previous studies to
cause brain damage in animals at doses similar to those used by humans.
</P>
<P>
	   Among 35 alleged ring members in custody Thursday were Debra Gravano;
Gravano's son, Gerard; his daughter, Karen; her husband, David Seabrook; and,
Michael Papa, another alleged ring leader.
</P>
<P>
	   Papa had at one time worked for Gravano's construction company.
</P>
<P>
	   Gravano, a confessed serial hitman, ravaged the Mafia by defecting to the
government, making headlines when he helped convict Gotti and dozens of other
gangland cronies. Authorities called him most important mob turncoat in U.S.
history.
</P>
<P>
	   His bombshell testimony, along with conversations secretly taped by the FBI,
finally put Gotti, the so-called "Teflon Don," behind bars for life in 1992
after three previous acquittals.
</P>
<P>
	   Under his deal with prosecutors, Gravano admitted to 19 murders, but served
only five years for racketeering.
</P>
<P>
	   He then entered the federal witness protection program, but dropped out in
December 1997 saying he wanted to live normally, not always looking over his
shoulder for "some kid" hoping to "make a name for himself by taking me out."
</P>
<P>
	   By 1999, he was making a new life in a Phoenix suburb, living under an
assumed name but telling a reporter for The Arizona Republic he didn't think he
was in any real danger.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not running from the (expletive) Mafia," Gravano told the Republic last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Ron Kuby, who represents the families of Gravano's 19 murder
victims in an ongoing civil suit, said Gravano's insistence that he was
repudiating his criminal ways had been a scam.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wonder how the government officials who cozied up to this mobster must
feel. First they allow him to get away with 19 murders, then they turn him loose
to deal poison to the unsuspecting people of Arizona. There ought to be a couple
of FBI agents, U.S. attorneys and one federal judge named as accomplices," Kuby
said.

<HEADLINE> Group Finds Candles Containing Lead  </HEADLINE>
    By CARL HARTMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Couples who light candles for a romantic dinner -- or
because the power goes out -- could put enough lead into the air to endanger
small children, said a study released Thursday by a consumer advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
	   Of 285 candles bought in the Washington area, the cotton wicks in 86 of them
were stiffened with metal and nine of those used high amounts of lead, the
Public Citizen study said. The cotton wick of a candle is woven around a narrow
stiffener, which may be metal or paper. When the candle burns, the metal melts
and releases a residue into the air.
</P>
<P>
	   Residue from lead in the wicks is dangerous, said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director
of the organization's health research group.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven of the candles in the nine that contained lead came from China or
Taiwan, one from Canada and one from the United States, Wolfe reported.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. candle makers agreed in 1974 to stop using lead under a voluntary
accord with the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which investigated lead in
candles and found no specific health risk.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year the commission began another investigation, spokesman Russ Rader
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't know that there is any kind of health hazard associated with
leaded candles," he said. "Anytime we get reports of lead involving consumer
products it's a concern of ours."
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfe said the candles tested released lead amounts that exceeded what the
commission says is dangerous for children under 6 years of age -- taking in more
than 15 micrograms -- 15 millionths of a gram -- in a day.
</P>
<P>
	   "In roughly 20 minutes walking or toddling or crawling into the room with
any of these candles burning, when it's at the peak concentration ... would
cause more than 15 micrograms to be ingested," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Public Citizen study concluded that when the lead-wick candles burn for
three hours, they can produce average concentrations of lead in the air ranging
from nine to 33 times higher than levels recommended by federal guidelines.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Candle Association, which represents American manufacturers and
distributors, said the majority of wicks manufactured in the United States are
made with 100 percent cotton and no metal core. Those with metal are typically
made with zinc.
</P>
<P>
	   The group suggested that consumers can identify candles containing lead by
peeling back the unburned cotton wick, exposing the metal core, and then rubbing
it on white paper. A zinc wick, the most common type, will leave no trace, but a
lead core will leave a gray mark like a pencil.
</P>
<P>
	   "So as far as our samples are concerned, the test is worthless," said Wolfe,
noting just three of the nine lead wick samples tested by Public Citizen made a
smudge on paper.
</P>
<P>
	   The candle association said the United States manufactured 375 million
pounds of candles in 1998 and imported 300 million pounds, about 40 percent,
mostly from China.

<HEADLINE> Atlantic City tunnel still ruffling feathers in casino industry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Nearly 16 months after work began on a $330
million road-and-tunnel connector here, executives for the two biggest casino
names in town are still bitter about the state's involvement in the project.
<P>
	   Park Place Entertainment Corp. CEO Arthur Goldberg and Trump Hotels &AMP; Casino
Resorts CEO Nicholas Ribis reiterated their opposition Thursday to state
incentives for Mirage Resorts Inc. and its planned $1 billion resort in the
marina district.
</P>
<P>
	   The state is paying two-thirds of the cost of the 2.2-mile road, which will
link the Atlantic City Expressway with the marina district site where Mirage
plans to build.
</P>
<P>
	   Mirage persuaded the state to help finance the project by saying its casino
was unlikely to be built without the road improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump and Goldberg have said all along that the project and companion
legislation providing tax breaks for Mirage are inappropriate incentives to give
an out-of-state company that owns no casinos here.
</P>
<P>
	   State and local leaders, however, said the road project will benefit other
casinos, too.
</P>
<P>
	   In consecutive addresses to a New Jersey Conference of Mayors luncheon
Thursday, Ribis and Goldberg sounded the theme anew, without mentioning either
Mirage or the tunnel by name.
</P>
<P>
	   But they left little doubt among the 300 mayors, municipal officials, casino
industry leaders and regulators who were on hand for the speeches what they were
referring to.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think that's the role of government, to come into town and
subsidize a company," he said. "It's a problem of too much government
interference."
</P>
<P>
	   He added: "What good does it do to have someone come here who really doesn't
want to come here unless you make it exceedingly wonderful for them?"
</P>
<P>
	   When Ribis took the microphone, he said Goldberg had said what he planned to
say. He went on to point out that it was Trump and Goldberg and their companies
- which now own half the casinos in town - that have built up Atlantic City
since 1978.
</P>
<P>
	   "Donald put his money where his mouth is, as he always does," Ribis said.
"Mr. Trump and Mr. Goldberg wrote the checks and hired the people, not because
someone said you can have this or you can have that if you come here," Ribis
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mirage spokesman Alan Feldman declined comment Thursday on Ribis' and
Goldberg's statements.
</P>
<P>
	   Curiously, they came a day after it appeared as though Mirage and Trump were
burying the hatchet. On Wednesday, the companies announced that they had agreed
to drop two civil lawsuits involving each other.
</P>
<P>
	   In one, Mirage claimed Trump and Hilton Hotels Corp. had pursued litigation
and lobbying to block Mirage from ever entering the Atlantic City market.
</P>
<P>
	   In the other, Mirage sued Trump and several individuals for allegedly
stealing trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
	   No money was exchanged as part of the settlements.

<HEADLINE> Damaging Testimony in Gov.'s Case  </HEADLINE>
   By NATALIE GOTT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- A former casino consultant tearfully told a federal
jury Thursday that he funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars in payoffs to
former Gov. Edwin Edwards and his son Stephen -- before and after Edwards left
office in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricky Shetler's testimony, backed by Shetler's own ledgers and conversations
secretly recorded by the FBI, was the most damaging to date in Edwards'
six-week-old federal racketeering trial -- and in the 40-year public life of the
scandal-plagued four-term governor.
</P>
<P>
	   By his own count, Edwards, 72, has been the subject of almost two dozen
state or federal investigations going back to his days as a congressman in the
'60s. In 1985, he was acquitted on federal racketeering charges involving health
care investments.
</P>
<P>
	   Known for his deadpan wit, Edwards has maintained a confident air throughout
this trial, despite a growing body of evidence against him. He has been
restrained from commenting on the evidence by the judge's gag order.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors say Edwin and Stephen Edwards and five other men took
part in a series of schemes to manipulate the licensing of riverboat casinos.
The ex-governor could face 350 years in prison and $7.2 million in fines if
convicted. Stephen could get 305 years.
</P>
<P>
	   As governor, Edwards appointed the now-defunct Louisiana Riverboat Gaming
Commission, which granted preliminary approval for riverboat licenses. And he
appointed the head of State Police, which issued the licenses.
</P>
<P>
	   Shetler, a lifelong friend of Stephen Edwards, turned on the Edwards family
in 1998, pleading guilty to extortion conspiracy charges and agreeing to
cooperate with federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   He fought back tears on the witness stand Thursday as federal prosecutor
Peter Strasser asked him how he felt about testifying against his friends.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Terrible,'' Shetler replied in a shaky voice while Stephen Edwards looked
on stoically. ``I feel terrible.''
</P>
<P>
	   Shetler said he gave the Edwardses cash, cars, furniture, appliances and
vacations in return for their help in getting state approval for two Players
riverboat casinos at Lake Charles and for hindering competition.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors reviewed ledgers with Shetler in which he had detailed his
payments to Stephen and Edwin Edwards. And they played tapes of conversations
secretly recorded in Edwin Edwards' law office in 1997 -- when Edwards allegedly
was continuing to accept payoffs for things he did before leaving office the
year before.
</P>
<P>
	   In one conversation, on Jan. 9, 1997, Stephen Edwards tells his father: ``I
have to get with Shetler. He still owes you the big check from November and all
of December. That should be six, seven, eight, nine thousand dollars.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a Feb. 25 conversation in the same office, Edwards appears to be making
sure he does not have to deal directly with the money.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen Edwards: ``Shetler's been calling me. I think I should just stay in
and meet with him. He's coming in with your money.''
</P>
<P>
	   Edwin Edwards: ``I'd rather you do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors have portrayed Players executives as the victims of
extortion rather than participants in a bribery scheme, although some former
executives testified under grants of immunity.

<HEADLINE> Senate Medicare Plan Attacked  </HEADLINE>
   By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration renewed its criticism of a
Medicare overhaul plan favored by Senate Republicans, saying it would
substantially increase out-of-pocket costs for retirees.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan could drive Medicare premiums up by as much as 47 percent -- not
including extra charges for a new prescription drug benefit, according to a
letter from Health and Human Services Department actuary Richard Foster.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter, dated Feb. 23, arrived in time for Democratic lawmakers to
distribute it at a Senate Finance Committee hearing Thursday, where the
legislation was under discussion.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., co-sponsor of the bill with Sen. John Breaux,
D-La., called the letter ``just a continuation of the administration's
disinformation campaign on Breaux-Frist, which is the only proposal that
provides both outpatient prescription drugs and true Medicare reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   HHS spokeswoman Melissa Skolfield defended Foster's analysis. While it may
serve the administration's position, she said that he serves in a
congressionally established office created to assess the financial condition of
Medicare and his conclusions are reached independently.
</P>
<P>
	   Frist and Breaux served last year on a bipartisan Medicare reform
commission, where the plan they are now peddling did not win enough support from
Democrats to be formally recommended to Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton has since come out with his own Medicare plan, featuring a
new prescription drug benefit providing $1,000 worth of coverage annually at a
cost to retirees of $26 per month.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans have criticized Clinton's plan as an attempt to score political
points for Democrats without seriously tackling the tough problems of curbing
Medicare costs, which are expected to balloon once baby boomers begin to retire
in about a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   The Breaux-Frist plan would seek to save the government money by making
Medicare more like the health benefits many younger Americans get from
employers.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior citizens would choose among pre-approved private health plans and
Medicare would pay a standard portion of the premium. Those choosing higher-cost
plans would pay more out-of-pocket, but supporters say competition among plans
would bring costs down for many.
</P>
<P>
	   A government-run Medicare option would continue to be available. But it
would have to compete under the same financial constraints as private plans.
</P>
<P>
	   For that reason, Foster said in his letter that staying in the
government-run plan -- which would be most similar to what retirees are used to
now -- could cost 25 percent more out-of-pocket.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Foster's letter noted that the Breaux-Frist legislation calls
for money from premiums collected from Medicare beneficiaries to cover 12
percent of Medicare's total costs. Under current law, premiums are scheduled to
cover about 10 percent of costs in 2003, 11 percent by 2010, and in 2015, the
program would run short of cash.
</P>
<P>
	   A boost to premiums covering 12 percent of costs in 2003 would translate
into a 22 percent rise in premiums, Foster estimated. Monthly Medicare premiums
are currently $45.50 per month.
</P>
<P>
	   Those choosing new prescription drug coverage offered under the Breaux-Frist
proposal would pay an additional charge, which Foster estimated at about $57.50
per month.

<HEADLINE> Lott Opposes Jurist Nomination  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Judge Richard Paez, nearing an appeals court confirmation
vote after a four-year delay, drew the opposition of Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott on Thursday while Democrats said President Clinton will lobby
wavering Republicans on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   The twin disclosures underscored the stakes involved in the fate of the
Hispanic jurist, who has been at the center of a lengthy dispute involving
racial politics as well as a struggle between the White House and the
GOP-controlled Senate. A vote is expected by March 15.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will be voting against Judge Paez,'' Lott, R-Miss., told reporters in a
brief interview outside the Senate chamber. He said be believes the 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals does not need additional judges at this time.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond that, he said he would oppose the nomination because ``some of his
rulings and some of his political activities while on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lott ``has voted against nominations before,'' countered Sen. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif., who is leading the effort to confirm Paez in the Senate. ``The most
important thing is that we get the vote,'' she said, and predicted there would
be enough support to elevate Paez to the appeals court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every Democrat is already in favor'' of Paez, she said, and Clinton is
``concentrating on Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate, meaning that Democrats must
win the votes of five Republicans to assure confirmation. Two GOP lawmakers,
Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Orrin Hatch of Utah, chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, voted for Paez when the panel approved his nomination last
summer.
</P>
<P>
	   The nomination has become exhibit A in the Democratic catalogue of
complaints that Republicans have dragged their feet on Clinton's judicial
appointments. In addition, it has become intertwined with Democratic attempts to
depict the GOP as hostile to the interests of Hispanics -- allegations that
Republicans protest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some people don't want these folks on the court,'' Clinton told an
audience of Hispanic leaders recently at the White House, referring to his
appointments of Paez and two other Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They don't want you to know they don't want them on the court, because
then you might not want them in the Senate,'' Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not rocket science. This is what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
	   Paez' supporters note he won confirmation once before as a federal judge,
and point to numerous expressions of praise for his work from attorneys. He
holds a ``well-qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association, its highest
grade.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservatives argue that the 9th Circuit has become a haven for judicial
activism, which they oppose, and that Paez himself has made questionable rulings
and remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   Some conservatives cite a speech in 1995 that they claim was critical of a
ballot proposition relating to affirmative action and a separate issue relating
to federal assistance for illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
	   A ruling in a 1998 case also angered conservatives, who claim Paez became
the first judge in the country to hold that an American corporation doing
business overseas could be held liable for human rights abuses committed by a
foreign government.
</P>
<P>
	   Paez' supporters take issue with that interpretation and say he was simply
making a procedural ruling as required under a precedent established by the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   John Czwartacki, Lott's spokesman, said the majority leader was also opposed
to confirming any judges for the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals whom he felt would
not return the panel ``to the mainstream.'' He said 9th Circuit opinions have
frequently been overruled by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Paez, a federal district court judge, was first nominated to the appeals
court in January 1996. The Judiciary Committee held a hearing but no action was
taken, and the nomination expired when Congress adjourned at year's end.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton renominated Paez in January 1997, and the Judiciary Committee
approved the appointment by voice vote in March 1998, although six Republicans
indicated their opposition. No Senate vote was taken, and again the nomination
expired when Congress adjourned at year's end.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton nominated Paez for a third time in January 1999. The Judiciary
Committee sent the nomination to the floor in July on a vote of 10-8.
</P>
<P>
	   Paez' appointment aside, the Senate took action during the day on two
uncontroversial nominations. By votes of 98-0, it confirmed George B. Daniels as
a District Judge for the Southern District of New York and Kermit Bye as U.S.
Circuit Judge of the Eighth Circuit.

<HEADLINE> SEC OKs E-Exchange's Bid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission has approved a
request by the International Securities Exchange, a proposed electronic exchange
for trading options on stocks of U.S. companies, to become the first exchange to
register with the SEC since 1973.
</P>
<P>
	   In announcing its approval Thursday, the SEC said that although the ISE
hasn't started operating, it already has had a "positive impact" on the options
market. Since the exchange filed its application a year ago, the nation's
options exchanges have reduced their transaction fees, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
	   Options give their holders the right to buy or sell stock at a specified
price before a specified date.
</P>
<P>
	   The ISE will not have a physical trading floor as the other options
exchanges do. It will become a self-regulatory organization, overseeing and
enforcing participants' compliance with its own rules and federal securities
laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Several new electronic stock-trading networks, called electronic
communications networks or ECNs, have applied to the SEC to be put on the same
legal footing as traditional exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The last exchange to become officially registered was the Chicago Board
Options Exchange in 1973.

<HEADLINE> Critics Seek To End HUD Program  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL SHEPARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Accusing the Department of Housing and Urban Developing
of losing $1.9 million through an administrative blunder, a frequent critic of
the agency called Thursday for abolishing its Community Builders program.
</P>
<P>
	   Senator Christopher Bond, R-Mo., who is chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee's panel on veterans affairs, HUD and independent
agencies, said the embattled program championed by the Clinton Administration
and designed to increase outreach to HUD clients was a failure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Community Builders program was designed as a public relations tool
that does not provide community builders with the needed expertise or
understanding of HUD housing...,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
	   A HUD spokesman later denied there was a $1.9 million loss, saying the
figure represents housing subsidies the government continued to cover but listed
on its books as ``holding costs'' after foreclosing on a landlord.
</P>
<P>
	   The Community Builders program was created in 1997 to separate ``customer
service'' and public outreach functions in HUD from the department's operation,
monitoring, enforcement and policing of dozens of housing programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The politically partisan nature of the dispute was in evidence Thursday as
Democratic senators on Bond's subcommittee voiced support for the program while
Republicans criticized it.
</P>
<P>
	   About 40 percent of the department's Community Builders are paid between
$75,000 and $100,000 a year, and they often duplicate work done through other
HUD programs, both factors that critics contend have eroded morale at the
agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The program has been touted by the Clinton administration as one of Housing
Secretary Andrew Cuomo's achievements in overhauling the department. But
problems with it first came to light last September when auditors in the
department concluded in a report that is poorly conceived, poorly run,
overpoliticized and a waste of money.
</P>
<P>
	   In the report, HUD's independent inspector general's office called the
Community Builders program an ``overly expensive'' endeavor that exacerbates the
department's long-standing management problems.
</P>
<P>
	   In one case cited Thursday, Bond said a community builder interfered with a
sale of a property and cost HUD $1.9 million in additional holding costs. Bond
also said five Community Builders were fired for ethical and conduct violations
while five others were identified with probable ethics problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy HUD Secretary Saul N. Ramirez Jr. didn't address the issue of the
$1.9 million loss during the hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview after the hearing, however, HUD spokesman Douglas Kantor
called Bond's statement ``factually inaccurate,'' saying the delay in selling
the foreclosed property didn't cost any additional taxpayer funds. Kantor said
the $1.9 million ``holding costs'' represents rent subsidies that HUD would have
covered for the building's tenants whether or not it had sold the property
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Ramirez told the Senate panel many at HUD are ``puzzled'' why the program
has been criticized so harshly and defended it as helping the agency become ``a
model for federal customer relations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ramirez also said several independent consulting firms, including Ernst &AMP;
Young, have praised the program as innovative and effective.
</P>
<P>
	   About half of the Community Builders were transferred into the program from
other divisions within HUD. The other half were hired from the outside and are
working under two-year contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond said he fears that the administration will try to put those 400 people
on the government's permanent payroll if the program is terminated next
September, as critics hope.

<HEADLINE> Euro Slips Below Parity With Dollar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro slipped back below parity with the dollar Thursday
after spending much of the trading day above the $1 level. The dollar edged
lower against the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
	   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 99.33 cents, down from
$1.0029 late Wednesday. The decline came just two days after the European
currency regained the $1 level for the first time in nearly a month.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders said they viewed the setback as temporary, with sentiment toward the
year-old European unit gaining some strength over the past several weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar gave back some of its recent gains against the yen, two days
after touching a six-month high against the Japanese currency. The dollar was
quoted at 111.06 yen in late trading, down from 111.30 yen Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also was quoted at 1.6202 Swiss francs, up from 1.6071, and
1.4559 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4618. The British pound fell to $1.6000
from $1.6028.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Thursday's
euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9695 German marks, up from 1.9504; 6.6055
French francs, up from 6.5413; and 1,949.82 Italian lire, up from 1,930.86.

<HEADLINE> Closing arguments begin in drug conspiracy case of two accused drug  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Both sides in the drug conspiracy trial of two men
accused of running the largest drug ring in Camden's history began their final
push Thursday to make their case to a jury.
<P>
	   Jose "J.R." Rivera, 40, a Camden businessman, is on trial as the alleged
financier and procurer for the multimillion dollar cartel. Luis "Tun" Figueroa,
was the enforcer, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
	   Both are charged with drug conspiracy. Rivera is charged with two counts of
money laundering. If convicted, both face life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The two are among 15 people charged in the case in 1998 when prosecutors
toppled the drug ring that had operated in Camden for nearly a decade. The
others pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities say the drug organization used violence - even murder - to
control a lucrative drug trade. It was so entrenched, authorities say, it took
years to break up the organization.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury, which heard seven weeks of testimony, is expected to begin
deliberating next week after U.S. District Judge Joseph H. Rodriguez instructs
the panel on the law.
</P>
<P>
	   In closing arguments in federal court Thursday, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Kevin Smith methodically summarized the prosecution case, which included
testimony by admitted drug dealers who once worked for the drug organization.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't have to like these people as witnesses," Smith told the jury of
12 women and three men. But he added, "your disgust does not make them liars."
</P>
<P>
	   However, defense attorney Carlos Martir, who represents Figueroa, said
prosecutors "made a pact with devils" who were willing "to lie, to fabricate, to
give the government what it wants."
</P>
<P>
	   "Nothing has matched the snow job that the government has presented here,"
Martir said in his closing arguments. "There is no excuse for the government's
handling of this case."
</P>
<P>
	   At least nine convicted drug dealers testified against Rivera and Figueroa,
detailing how the organization distributed hundreds of kilos of cocaine in
Camden through two open-air drug markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Figueroa - described by the prosecutor as "the man with the gun" - was also
implicated by witnesses in the 1993 execution-style slaying of a rival drug
dealer. He will be tried later in state court on a murder charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Martir noted that the prosecution's key witness, Juan Marquez, a former drug
dealer-turned informant, did not record any conversations with Figueroa. He
called Marquez "a psychological study in paranoia, fabrication and lies."
</P>
<P>
	   "He fabricated and he exaggerated," said Martir, who will continue his
closing arguments when the trial resumes Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   The testimony during the trial included allegations that Camden Mayor Milton
Milan bought kilo shipments of cocaine in 1993, before he was elected. Witnesses
also alleged that Milan tipped off drug dealers after he became mayor in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Milan, who has acknowledged Rivera as a boyhood acquaintance, has denied the
allegations. He is not charged in the case and has not been accused of any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities have said the drug ring flourished because of its high-ranking
connections. Witnesses said law enforcement officers shook down drug dealers for
bribes and tipped them off about upcoming raids.
</P>
<P>
	   The drug organization raked in profits from a thriving business, using the
money to purchase homes, cars, businesses and a boat, Smith said. They made so
much cash that it was difficult to hide the money, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rivera, who owns a gym and auto store in Camden, held money for drug dealers
and exchanged their small bills - usually for one hundred dollar bills, Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith described Rivera as "the money man," an advisor and counselor to the
drug organization. He presided at meetings and settled disputes among members,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "J.R. had risen in the Camden drug world to a level of power," Smith said
during his closing arguments that lasted more than four hours. "No one will mess
with J.R."
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators eventually closed in on the drug organization, and one-by-one
13 codefendants in the case pleaded guilty and many agreed to testify against
Rivera.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Smith, when Rivera was arrested he said, "so you finally got
me."

<HEADLINE> EPA Said Lagging on Arsenic Rules  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency was accused Thursday
of not moving quickly enough to strengthen a 58-year-old standard that
determines how much arsenic should be allowed in drinking water.
</P>
<P>
	   The Natural Resources Defense Council said it will soon file a lawsuit
forcing the EPA to update the old arsenic standard, maintaining that it allows
thousands of people to be exposed to unhealthy levels of the cancer-causing
chemical.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly a year ago, a report by the National Academy of Sciences recommended
more stringent controls on arsenic in drinking water. While the report
acknowledged there are uncertainties about how arsenic exposure triggers cancer,
it said the current EPA regulation ``does not sufficiently protect public
health.''
</P>
<P>
	   The EPA agreed with the report's findings, and officials said a new arsenic
standard for drinking water was being developed. The agency had hoped to get a
new standard out by January, but did not meet the deadline. Officials still
hoped for a new standard this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The NRDC said it was planning to file the lawsuit to nudge the EPA toward
action. The group wants the maximum arsenic content in water to be no more than
3 parts per billion. Currently the EPA standard, dating back to 1942, is 50
parts per billion and the international standard -- which the EPA is considering
-- is 10 parts per billion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What will it take the EPA to do something about this enormous health
risk?'' said Erik Olson, a water quality specialist at the NRDC, a leading
environmental advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Congress told the EPA to update its arsenic regulation, put in place
in 1942, in the mid 1970s and again in the 1980s, and then set a Jan. 1, 2000
deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the NRDC said that the EPA's own data shows that more than 34
million people in at least 6,900 communities drink tap water from water supply
systems containing arsenic at average levels that pose a health risk.
</P>
<P>
	   The NRDC said it examined the results, from the EPA, of more than 100,000
water samples from 24,000 public water systems in 25 states.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Water Works Association, representing private experts on
drinking water quality, has endorsed the call for stricter standards for
arsenic.
</P>
<P>
	   But the group said if the international standard of 10 micrograms per liter
is adopted, it could cost more than $1 billion. The group estimated 2,200 of the
56,000 U.S. water supply systems would be affected by such a rule change.
</P>
<P>
	   The EPA has estimated that a 5 parts per billion standard would cost $686
million a year to implement and that a 2 parts per billion standard would cost
$2.1 billion a year, according to the NRDC report.
</P>
<P>
	   Inorganic arsenic, the form most likely to cause cancer, occurs naturally in
the earth and is released into ground water that travels through rocks and soil.
The highest exposure to arsenic is in drinking water from wells as opposed to
areas, including most urban areas, that get drinking water from lakes and
streams, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Gravano's old enemies: We told you so  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Back in Sammy Gravano's hometown, his old enemies
shouted a chorus of "I told you so" Thursday after the Mafia killer was arrested
in Arizona on drug charges.
<P>
	   As for friends of "The Bull" ... well, they weren't saying much.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce Cutler, attorney for jailed mob boss John Gotti, can be counted among
the enemies. He was easy to locate, and eager to condemn Gravano as "the great
impostor, a liar, a coward."
</P>
<P>
	   That was in the first minute of his news conference, when Cutler was just
warming up. Later, he condemned the former Gambino family underboss as "a
Tasmanian devil, full of lies."
</P>
<P>
	   "I was waiting for this," Cutler continued in his Manhattan office. "You
can't change the nature of a man ... He is a reprobate, a craven liar. Gravano
is motivated only by greed. I guess he didn't steal enough before."
</P>
<P>
	   That's before he entered the federal witness protection program, which the
Brooklyn-born Gravano did in the spring of 1995 after testifying against Gotti
in a trial that ended with the Dapper Don being sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Gravano, who admitted killing 19 people, wound up with just a 5-year jail
sentence because of his deal with the government. His testimony eventually led
to the convictions of three dozen mobsters, including Genovese family boss
Vincent "The Chin" Gigante.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Ron Kuby, who represents the families of Gravano's 19 murder
victims in an ongoing civil suit, said there was no surprise that career
criminal had allegedly returned to his illegal ways.
</P>
<P>
	   "All of that nonsense about Gravano being reformed, repudiating his criminal
ways, was just another scam to get over, just as Sammy Gravano has done
successfully his entire adult life," Kuby said.

	   The families of Gravano's murder victims filed suit under the state's "Son
of Sam" law, looking to seize profits from the killer's biography, "Underboss."
The law prevents criminals from making a profit on their crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal authorities who helped Gravano get a deal - letting him serve
barely two months for each murder - had little to say Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI, which cut the deal, had no comment, said spokesman Joe Valiquette.
Former U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney, whose office prosecuted Gotti, did not
return a phone call.
</P>
<P>
	   Cutler said he planned to call Gotti at the federal prison in Marion, Ill.,
to pass on word of Gravano's arrest - hopefully in the next week. But Cutler
predicted that the ex-head of the Gambino family would not delight in the fall
of his nemesis.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only concern John Gotti would have about this," Cutler said with a
straight face, "is concern about the teenagers who were buying those pills."

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors say two men made more than $1 million through cyber  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Two men exploited "the dark side of the Internet" when
they made more than $1 million by driving up the value of penny stocks with a
flood of e-mails disguised as if they had been sent by America Online, a
prosecutor said Thursday.
<P>
	   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White announced the securities fraud charges against
James Sheret Jr. and Glenn Conley in connection with a nationwide,
Internet-based scheme involving about 60 companies.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the dark side of the Internet," White said in a statement.
"Determined fraudsters can swindle a virtual audience by taking large positions
in thinly traded stocks, disseminating hundreds of thousands of Spam e-mails
touting these stocks and then sell them into the fraudulently inflated market
they have created."
</P>
<P>
	   She said the method of cheating investors was similar to what goes on in so
called boiler rooms, where dozens of stock brokers at a time pitch stocks to
investors to drive up prices.
</P>
<P>
	   She said the boiler room scam "takes on a new dimension because of the
ability online to reach thousands, if not millions, of investors with a single
keystroke."
</P>
<P>
	   "Whether people commit these crimes in cyberspace or in office space, we
will identify them, we will find them and we will prosecute them," White said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis Schiliro, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York office,
said the case "represents the marriage of an old scheme with modern technology."
</P>
<P>
	   "Unscrupulous stock manipulators should be on notice that, to the law
enforcement community, it's the message, not the medium, that matters," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheret, 31, of Bayside, Queens and Conley, 31, of Gaston, Oregon, allegedly
operated the fraud from November until earlier this month, making themselves
$1.13 million in illegal profits, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   They allegedly sent hundreds of thousands of e-mails touting the investment
prospects of thinly traded, largely dormant microcap companies whose stock they
had purchased.
</P>
<P>
	   Then they disguised the e-mails to make them appear as if they had been sent
by America Online Inc., authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   A criminal complaint alleged that the men fraudulently opened e-mail
accounts through 23 Internet service providers around the country and used false
information to conceal their identity.
</P>
<P>
	   The false names, addresses and telephone numbers made it difficult to
determine the source of the bogus e-mails, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Securities and Exchange Commission also brought civil charges against
the men.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted, they could face up to five years in prison and a maximum fine
of $250,000 or twice the gross gain resulting from the offense.

<HEADLINE> Damaging Testimony in Gov.'s Case  </HEADLINE>
   By NATALIE GOTT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- A former casino consultant tearfully told a federal
jury Thursday that he funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars in payoffs to
former Gov. Edwin Edwards and his son Stephen -- before and after Edwards left
office in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricky Shetler's testimony, backed by Shetler's own ledgers and conversations
secretly recorded by the FBI, was the most damaging to date in Edwards'
six-week-old federal racketeering trial -- and in the 40-year public life of the
scandal-plagued four-term governor.
</P>
<P>
	   By his own count, Edwards, 72, has been the subject of almost two dozen
state or federal investigations going back to his days as a congressman in the
'60s. In 1985, he was acquitted on federal racketeering charges involving health
care investments.
</P>
<P>
	   Known for his deadpan wit, Edwards has maintained a confident air throughout
this trial, despite a growing body of evidence against him. He has been
restrained from commenting on the evidence by the judge's gag order.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors say Edwin and Stephen Edwards and five other men took
part in a series of schemes to manipulate the licensing of riverboat casinos.
The ex-governor could face 350 years in prison and $7.2 million in fines if
convicted. Stephen could get 305 years.
</P>
<P>
	   As governor, Edwards appointed the now-defunct Louisiana Riverboat Gaming
Commission, which granted preliminary approval for riverboat licenses. And he
appointed the head of State Police, which issued the licenses.
</P>
<P>
	   Shetler, a lifelong friend of Stephen Edwards, turned on the Edwards family
in 1998, pleading guilty to extortion conspiracy charges and agreeing to
cooperate with federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   He fought back tears on the witness stand Thursday as federal prosecutor
Peter Strasser asked him how he felt about testifying against his friends.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Terrible,'' Shetler replied in a shaky voice while Stephen Edwards looked
on stoically. ``I feel terrible.''
</P>
<P>
	   Shetler said he gave the Edwardses cash, cars, furniture, appliances and
vacations in return for their help in getting state approval for two Players
riverboat casinos at Lake Charles and for hindering competition.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors reviewed ledgers with Shetler in which he had detailed his
payments to Stephen and Edwin Edwards. And they played tapes of conversations
secretly recorded in Edwin Edwards' law office in 1997 -- when Edwards allegedly
was continuing to accept payoffs for things he did before leaving office the
year before.
</P>
<P>
	   In one conversation, on Jan. 9, 1997, Stephen Edwards tells his father:
``I've got to get with Shetler because he still owes you the big check from
November and all of December. That should be six, seven, eight, nine thousand
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a Feb. 25 conversation in the same office, Edwards appears to be making
sure he does not have to deal directly with the money.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen Edwards: ``Shetler's been calling me. I think I should just stay in
and meet with him. He's coming in with your money.''
</P>
<P>
	   Edwin Edwards: ``I'd rather you do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors have portrayed Players executives as the victims of
extortion rather than participants in a bribery scheme, although some former
executives testified under grants of immunity.
</P>
<P>
	   The case brought pressure on Louisiana gambling regulators to revoke the
company's licenses for its two Lake Charles riverboats. The company eventually
agreed to pay the state $10.8 million and get out of Louisiana.

<HEADLINE> McCain Bids for GOP Votes in Calif.  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Calling himself ``a proud Reagan Republican,''
John McCain touted his endorsement by San Diego's GOP mayor Thursday and
underlined conservative credentials in a new ad airing in primary states from
California to New York.
</P>
<P>
	   After winning in New Hampshire and Michigan with an appeal to Democrats and
independents as well as Republicans, McCain is seeking to gain on rival George
W. Bush among registered Republicans here. Republicans alone will determine
which candidate is awarded all 162 of the state's GOP presidential delegates in
the March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a big spender and not a fiscal conservative,'' McCain said of Bush
during a visit to California State University at Sacramento. To support the
charge in the heart of Reagan country, McCain said the Texas governor raised his
state's spending by 35 percent during his tenure, compared with President
Clinton's federal spending increase of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``George Bush is a lot of things. But a conservative he's not,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has linked the increase in part to his state's booming population and
contends that McCain's own voting record -- including his support of a tobacco
tax bill in 1998 -- reveals that the Arizona senator compromises too easily on
conservative goals.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor also accuses McCain of hypocrisy for dismissing the
Republican establishment even as he publicizes new endorsements from GOP
leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain often says one thing and does another,'' said Bush
spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush was taking a rare day off from the campaign Thursday at home in Austin.
He had a full schedule Friday in Virginia, where Republicans will hold their
primary next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   As in many states, Virginia's governor and most top GOP officials are Bush
supporters. Attorney General Mark L. Earley said he would endorse Bush on Friday
in Newport News.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's new ad, titled ``Reagan Conservative,'' takes aim at Bush and that
army of elected supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can't turn on your TV without seeing an ad from the establishment
trying to fool you about me,'' McCain says. ``I'm a proud Reagan Republican. ...
Give me your vote and we'll give you back your government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Bob Dole, the party's unsuccessful 1996 candidate, made a plea
for a ``time-out'' on intraparty accusations ``before matters get out of
control'' and give the Democrats a big advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole hasn't endorsed either candidate, but he has been close to McCain, who
sometimes traveled with him on his campaign plane in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   After a town hall meeting, McCain appeared here with two establishment
figures at his side, San Diego Mayor Susan Golding and California Secretary of
State Bill Jones.
</P>
<P>
	   Golding called McCain ``the Republicans' best bet to win back the White
House,'' and she said, ``He will bring faith in our country and pride in the
White House back to America.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I respect him more than I can say. And he respects me. And I think that's
something that the women who are voting in the Republican Party need to
understand,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike Jones, Golding had not previously endorsed McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Touting his conservatism is only part of McCain's strategy for the March 7
``Super Tuesday'' primaries. In California, he will augment that message with
appeals for the votes of senior citizens by talking up his plan to use the
federal budget surplus to pay down Social Security rather than for a massive tax
cut, according to senior adviser Ken Khachigian.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator also was making points aimed at independents and
Democrats, part of his national strategy to make the case that he appeals to a
broader range of voters and could win a general election.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Don't you think that Republicans in California would like to win a
campaign for a change?'' McCain asked the crowd, which responded with the
loudest applause of his speech here. ``In order to do that, my friends, we have
to practice the politics of addition.''
</P>
<P>
	   He took more shots at Bush for speaking at Bob Jones University without
denouncing the school's ban on interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's out-and-out racism,'' McCain said. ``Governor Bush went there and
never said a word. I would never ever do such a thing.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain tripped over one issue when a questioner asked whether he would
support California's Proposition 22, which states that California would not
recognize same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would not vote for it,'' McCain said at first, contradicting his own
opposition to same-sex marriage. Later, he told reporters he had misunderstood
the question and would support the initiative, especially since he voted that
way in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I understood the question to be as to whether I would vote to legalize gay
marriage. I would not and I would vote for Prop 22,'' McCain said. ``I'm not
familiar with as many of the propositions here in California as perhaps I should
be. ... I will be well versed in all of those propositions as we go through the
campaign.''

<HEADLINE> Atlantic City tunnel still ruffling feathers in casino industry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Nearly 16 months after work began on a $330
million road-and-tunnel connector here, executives for the two biggest casino
names in town are still bitter about the state's involvement in the project.
<P>
	   Park Place Entertainment Corp. CEO Arthur Goldberg and Trump Hotels &AMP; Casino
Resorts CEO Nicholas Ribis reiterated their opposition Thursday to state
incentives for Mirage Resorts Inc. and its planned $1 billion resort in the
marina district.
</P>
<P>
	   The state is paying two-thirds of the cost of the 2.2-mile road, which will
link the Atlantic City Expressway with the marina district site where Mirage
plans to build.
</P>
<P>
	   Mirage persuaded the state to help finance the project by saying its casino
was unlikely to be built without the road improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   Donald Trump and Goldberg have said all along that the project and companion
legislation providing tax breaks for Mirage are inappropriate incentives to give
an out-of-state company that owns no casinos here.
</P>
<P>
	   State and local leaders, however, said the road project will benefit other
casinos, too.
</P>
<P>
	   In consecutive addresses to a New Jersey Conference of Mayors luncheon
Thursday, Ribis and Goldberg sounded the theme anew, without mentioning either
Mirage or the tunnel by name.
</P>
<P>
	   But they left little doubt among the 300 mayors, municipal officials, casino
industry leaders and regulators who were on hand for the speeches what they were
referring to.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think that's the role of government, to come into town and
subsidize a company," Goldberg said. "It's a problem of too much government
interference."
</P>
<P>
	   He added: "What good does it do to have someone come here who really doesn't
want to come here unless you make it exceedingly wonderful for them?"
</P>
<P>
	   When Ribis took the microphone, he said Goldberg had said what he planned to
say. He went on to point out that it was Trump and Goldberg and their companies
- which now own half the casinos in town - that have built up Atlantic City
since 1978.
</P>
<P>
	   "Donald put his money where his mouth is, as he always does," Ribis said.
"Mr. Trump and Mr. Goldberg wrote the checks and hired the people, not because
someone said you can have this or you can have that if you come here," Ribis
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mirage spokesman Alan Feldman declined comment Thursday on Ribis' and
Goldberg's statements.
</P>
<P>
	   Curiously, they came a day after it appeared as though Mirage and Trump were
burying the hatchet. On Wednesday, the companies announced that they had agreed
to drop two civil lawsuits involving each other.
</P>
<P>
	   In one, Mirage claimed Trump and Hilton Hotels Corp. had pursued litigation
and lobbying to block Mirage from ever entering the Atlantic City market.
</P>
<P>
	   In the other, Mirage sued Trump and several individuals for allegedly
stealing trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
	   No money was exchanged as part of the settlements.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Protest Austrian Govt.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Blowing whistles and banging drums, thousands of
people marched through the capital Thursday to protest the inclusion of Joerg
Haider's party in Austria's ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   About 12,000 people had joined the peaceful demonstration within an hour of
its start, said Vienna police spokesman Martin Stradel.
</P>
<P>
	   The march followed a Saturday demonstration in which tens of thousands of
Austrians and other Europeans gathered in the heart of Vienna to rally against
the new government, led by Wolfgang Schuessel of the conservative People's Party
and including Haider's far-right Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterwards, demonstration organizers called for protests to continue every
Thursday until the government steps down.
</P>
<P>
	   Anti-government rallies have become a near-daily practice in Vienna since
the new government coalition took office Feb. 4. The European Union, Israel and
the United States have taken measures to isolate Austria diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
	   The outrage stems from Haider's opposition to both immigration and rapid EU
expansion. He has also been criticized for previous statements praising some
Nazi policies, but he has since apologized for those.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview broadcast Thursday on Slovak state television STV, Schuessel
dismissed demonstrators' power to bring about a change of government, but said
he had nothing against peaceful protests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are many of those who do not agree with us, but there are even more
who do agree with the new government,'' he said. ``The protests will surely not
bring an end to this government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Schuessel reiterated his criticism of the EU sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The way the EU presented them is not correct,'' he told STV. ``The
sanctions were applied without any dialogue, which is unusual and it contradicts
the spirit of European agreements.''

<HEADLINE> Texas Executes Convicted Killer  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL GRACZYK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A 62-year-old woman was executed by injection
Thursday after Gov. George W. Bush rejected her claim that she killed her fifth
husband in self-defense and deserved a reprieve.
</P>
<P>
	   Betty Lou Beets became the fourth woman to be executed in the United States
since the Supreme Court in 1976 allowed the death penalty to resume. She was the
second woman executed in Texas since the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
	   She gave no final statement as she lay strapped to the death chamber gurney.
She made no eye contact with the victim's family, but smiled at relatives on her
side.
</P>
<P>
	   Death penalty opponents had urged Bush to grant Beets a 30-day delay,
arguing it would be consistent with his description of himself as a
``compassionate conservative'' in his presidential campaign. The delay was
Bush's only option, since the state parole board did not recommend that her
sentence be commuted to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   During his 5 1/2 years as governor, 120 convicted killers have been executed
in Texas. He has spared one condemned inmate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After careful review of the evidence of the case, I concur with the jury
that Betty Lou Beets is guilty of this murder,'' Bush said in a written
statement after returning to Texas from California, where he was campaigning for
the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm confident that the courts, both state and federal, have thoroughly
reviewed all the issues raised by the defendant.''
</P>
<P>
	   Beets and her lawyers insisted the former bartender-waitress, convicted of
fatally shooting fifth husband Jimmy Don Beets nearly 17 years ago and burying
his body under a flower garden, was the victim of years of domestic abuse and
should be allowed to live.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans rejected an
appeal that accused the state of not following its own rules in reviewing Beets'
case. The arguments were dismissed Wednesday by a federal judge in Austin as a
delay tactic.
</P>
<P>
	   Beets' lawyers also took the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court, which
rejected it without comment.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the governor's office, Bush had received 2,108 phone calls and
letters opposing Beets' execution by Thursday afternoon, and 57 calls and
letters favoring it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A decision to stay the execution of Ms. Beets would demonstrate your
compassionate conservatism and that you are willing to do what is right even in
the face of potential criticism from your constituents,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson
wrote Bush on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Steven Hawkins, executive director of the National Coalition to Abolish the
Death Penalty implored to Bush grant a reprieve ``so evidence of her being
battered ... may be fully evaluated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Far from receiving careful consideration, the role of domestic abuse in
Betty's crime has been continually swept under the rug by the Texas court
system,'' Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Beets, the last woman executed in Texas was Karla Faye Tucker, on
Feb. 3, 1998. Tucker hacked two people to death with a pickax but said she had a
religious conversion in prison and appealed for mercy. Bush was criticized for
mocking Tucker in a magazine interview last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Beets was the ninth convicted killer and the second in as many days to be
executed in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state.
</P>
<P>
	   She spent Thursday morning meeting with relatives. She declined to request a
final meal.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Beets insisted she was innocent, a jury convicted her of killing
Jimmy Don Beets, a Dallas Fire Department captain, to collect his life insurance
and pension.
</P>
<P>
	   Her claims of domestic abuse surfaced only recently and were not a factor in
her 1985 trial, although one of her daughters, Faye Lane, in a tearful plea for
her mother's life, said this week her mother was acting in self-defense after
years of abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know that if the jury heard the truth about my momma, she only could
have done something like this if she'd been very scared or threatened,'' Lane
said.
</P>
<P>
	   James Beets, the murder victim's son, discounted claims of abuse, saying she
told friends her husband of 11 months had been the best thing to happen to
her.``Why is she saying what she is saying about my daddy?'' James Beets said.
</P>
<P>
	   Betty Lou Beets also was convicted of shooting and wounding her second
husband, Bill Lane, and was charged but never tried in the 1981 shooting death
of her fourth husband, Doyle Barker.
</P>
<P>
	   Acting on a tip two years after Jimmy Don Beets was reported missing from a
fishing trip, authorities found his body buried under a wishing well flower
garden in the yard of their trailer home. They also discovered nearby in another
shallow grave the body of Barker, who had been missing for four years.
</P>
<P>
	   Both had been shot in the back of the head and stuffed into blue sleeping
bags.
</P>
<P>
	   Beets blamed a son for Jimmy Don Beets' death. The son denied any
involvement and testified against her. Beets explained Barker's disappearance by
saying he left one day and never returned. She blamed husband No. 2, Lane, for
Barker's death.
</P>
<P>
	   The Catholic bishops of Texas, long opponents of the death penalty, asked
Bush this week to follow the lead of Illinois and suspend executions. Bush has
refused.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Police Intercept Mail Bombs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Authorities have intercepted eight booby-trapped video
cassettes, the latest in a recent wave of attempted mail bombings targeting
journalists and politicians, police said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Four of the intended targets included a news director and a reporter from
the tabloid newspaper La Hora, the assistant director of the newspaper Hoy, and
a television anchor from Channel 4.
</P>
<P>
	   Police refused to identify the other intended recipients, or to say when
they found the eight bombs.
</P>
<P>
	   The explosives were the same type sent both to a top evangelical Indian
leader, who became suspicious of the package and summoned police on Monday, and
to Channel 10 news director Rafael Cuesta, the only known person to be injured
in the terror campaign. He suffered minor wounds on his hands and face.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said that bomb was designed to frighten and not to cause serious
injury. But they have said nothing about how powerful the other bombs were.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear what the motive was for the attacks. At least some of the
mail bombs were preceded by written threats, but news agencies and authorities
refused to reveal the contents of those threats.
</P>
<P>
	   Groups calling themselves the National Liberation Army of Ecuador and the
People's Combatants Group have both claimed responsibility for mailing the
explosives.
</P>
<P>
	   Ecuador's 123-member Congress received special seminars on Monday and
Tuesday on how to detect mail bombs.

<HEADLINE> Disney Tops First Lady's Donors  </HEADLINE>
   By SHANNON McCAFFREY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mickey Mouse's pockets are deep for Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Walt Disney executives and their families donated $56,500 to Clinton's U.S.
Senate campaign, more than any other company. But as an industry, lawyers topped
the list, giving the Yale Law School graduate $666,879, according to an analysis
of her campaign reports by the Center for Responsive Politics. The entertainment
industry was next, donating $439,740, the nonpartisan center said.
</P>
<P>
	   The analysis also showed that 56 percent -- or $3.4 million -- of the $6
million Clinton has raised from individuals came from outside New York.
Donations poured in from 45 other states and the District of Columbia, the
center found. Clinton raised a total of $8.1 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can see that this really is a national race,'' said Larry Makinson,
executive director of the center that studies money and political campaigns.
``She's successfully tapping traditional Democratic donors, like lawyers. The
twist is how well she's connected to Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton drew $668,779 from California, topping all states except New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the $2.7 million raised in New York, $2.2 million came from the New York
City metropolitan area, mostly from wealthy neighborhoods on Manhattan's Upper
East Side.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton received just $13,250 from her new hometown of Chappaqua, the
Westchester County town where she and the president recently bought a $1.7
million home.
</P>
<P>
	   Other heavy givers to Clinton were Massachusetts ($382,600), Texas
($312,824), District of Columbia ($276,940), and Illinois ($229,700), the center
found.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has been fighting the perception that she is a carpetbagger in New
York, where she had not lived or work until launching her Senate bid. The
campaign of her GOP rival, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, also has been
receiving large numbers of out-of-state contributions.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bruce Teitelbaum, Giuliani's campaign manager, criticized the first lady
Thursday for ``running a campaign based out of California, Illinois and
Massachusetts with money from wealthy trial lawyers and movie producers.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said less than half of Giuliani's $11.5 million campaign warchest has
come from outside New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Aside from lawyers and entertainment executives, the analysis also showed
Clinton was popular with the securities and investment industry. Her
second-largest single donor company was Goldman Sachs Co., where executives and
their families donated $39,120. Other top donors also are in the financial
services industry: Deloitte and Touche ($28,750); Patton Boggs ($25,500) and
Citigroup ($22,000).
</P>
<P>
	   Corporations cannot give money to candidates directly, political action
committees they create may contribute, along with their employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Makinson said he expected to conduct a similar analysis of the mayor's fund
raising when the data becomes available electronically from the Federal Election
Commission.

<HEADLINE> Texas Executes Convicted Killer  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL GRACZYK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A 62-year-old woman was executed by injection
Thursday after Gov. George W. Bush rejected her claim that she killed her fifth
husband in self-defense and deserved a reprieve.
</P>
<P>
	   Betty Lou Beets became the fourth woman to be executed in the United States
since the Supreme Court in 1976 allowed the death penalty to resume. She was the
second woman executed in Texas since the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
	   She gave no final statement as she lay strapped to the death chamber gurney.
She made no eye contact with the victim's family, but smiled at relatives
watching through a window at her side. She continued smiling as she slipped into
unconsciousness.
</P>
<P>
	   Death penalty opponents and domestic violence organizations had urged Bush
to grant Beets a 30-day delay, arguing it would be consistent with his
description of himself as a ``compassionate conservative'' in his presidential
campaign. The delay was Bush's only option, since the state parole board did not
recommend that her sentence be commuted to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   During his 5 1/2 years as governor, 120 convicted killers have been executed
in Texas. He has spared one condemned inmate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After careful review of the evidence of the case, I concur with the jury
that Betty Lou Beets is guilty of this murder,'' Bush said in a written
statement after returning to Texas from California, where he was campaigning for
the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm confident that the courts, both state and federal, have thoroughly
reviewed all the issues raised by the defendant.''
</P>
<P>
	   Beets and her lawyers insisted the former bartender-waitress, convicted of
fatally shooting fifth husband Jimmy Don Beets nearly 17 years ago and burying
his body under a flower garden, was the victim of years of domestic abuse and
should be allowed to live.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans rejected an
appeal that accused the state of not following its own rules in reviewing Beets'
case. The arguments were dismissed Wednesday by a federal judge in Austin as a
delay tactic.
</P>
<P>
	   Beets' lawyers also took the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court, which
rejected it without comment.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the governor's office, Bush had received 2,108 phone calls and
letters opposing Beets' execution by Thursday afternoon, and 57 calls and
letters favoring it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A decision to stay the execution of Ms. Beets would demonstrate your
compassionate conservatism and that you are willing to do what is right even in
the face of potential criticism from your constituents,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson
wrote Bush on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Steven Hawkins, executive director of the National Coalition to Abolish the
Death Penalty implored to Bush grant a reprieve ``so evidence of her being
battered ... may be fully evaluated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Far from receiving careful consideration, the role of domestic abuse in
Betty's crime has been continually swept under the rug by the Texas court
system,'' Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Beets, the last woman executed in Texas was Karla Faye Tucker, on
Feb. 3, 1998. Tucker hacked two people to death with a pickax but said she had a
religious conversion in prison and appealed for mercy. Bush was criticized for
mocking Tucker in a magazine interview last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Beets was the ninth convicted killer and the second in as many days to be
executed in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state.
</P>
<P>
	   She spent Thursday morning meeting with relatives. She declined to request a
final meal.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Beets insisted she was innocent, a jury convicted her of killing
Jimmy Don Beets, a Dallas Fire Department captain, to collect his life insurance
and pension.
</P>
<P>
	   Her claims of domestic abuse surfaced only recently and were not a factor in
her 1985 trial, although one of her daughters, Faye Lane, in a tearful plea for
her mother's life, said this week her mother was acting in self-defense after
years of abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know that if the jury heard the truth about my momma, she only could
have done something like this if she'd been very scared or threatened,'' Lane
said.
</P>
<P>
	   James Beets, the murder victim's son, discounted claims of abuse, saying she
told friends her husband of 11 months had been the best thing to happen to
her.``Why is she saying what she is saying about my daddy?'' James Beets said.
</P>
<P>
	   Betty Lou Beets also was convicted of shooting and wounding her second
husband, Bill Lane, and was charged but never tried in the 1981 shooting death
of her fourth husband, Doyle Barker.
</P>
<P>
	   Acting on a tip two years after Jimmy Don Beets was reported missing from a
fishing trip, authorities found his body buried under a wishing well flower
garden in the yard of their trailer home. They also discovered nearby in another
shallow grave the body of Barker, who had been missing for four years.
</P>
<P>
	   Both had been shot in the back of the head and stuffed into blue sleeping
bags.
</P>
<P>
	   Beets blamed a son for Jimmy Don Beets' death. The son denied any
involvement and testified against her. Beets explained Barker's disappearance by
saying he left one day and never returned. She blamed husband No. 2, Lane, for
Barker's death.
</P>
<P>
	   The Catholic bishops of Texas, long opponents of the death penalty, asked
Bush this week to follow the lead of Illinois and suspend executions. Bush has
refused.

<HEADLINE> State officials try to explain Newark school budget shortfall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Contrite New Jersey education officials Thursday
appeared before lawmakers to try to explain how a $58 million surplus turned
into a $58 million deficit in the five years since the state took over the
beleaguered Newark school district.
<P>
	   State-appointed Newark school officials rarely followed mandatory fiscal
controls such as uniform accounting practices and monthly financial reports. In
turn, state officials did not enforce them, Education Commissioner David Hespe
told a joint meeting of the Senate and Assembly education committees.
</P>
<P>
	   Hespe, who said the financial mess is "ultimately my responsibility,"
released department memos showing that former Commissioner Leo Klagholz was
aware of the magnitude of the problem as early as February 1998 but took no
corrective action.
</P>
<P>
	   "It seems like everybody thought they were off the hook by sending a memo.
They could say, don't blame me, I told them," said Senate Committee Chairman
Robert J. Martin, R-Morris.
</P>
<P>
	   Klagholz and former school Superintendent Beverly Hall, on whose watch the
budget problems occurred, did not attend the hearing. Both issued written
statements blaming budget shortfalls on city political influence prior to the
July 1995 state takeover and saying they did their best to remedy them.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin called the hearing because the state will have to come to the school
district's rescue to close the budget gap. The state already provides about 80
percent of the district's $555 million budget in state aid. The district, the
state's largest with 40,000 pupils, is among the state's 30 so-called special
needs districts. It is also one of three districts taken over by the state due
to academic failure and fiscal mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
	   "Before we provide any more money, we have to ascertain what went wrong,
where has the money gone and who is at fault," Martin said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to a Department of Education report released at the hearing, the
district's surplus gradually dwindled, beginning in 1995, the year of the state
takeover, as school officials regularly spent money they did not have.
</P>
<P>
	   "Who was doing the budget analysis at this time?" Martin asked Hespe. "No
business would operate with a checkbook and not know what was in their account."
</P>
<P>
	   State officials, meanwhile, became aware of a looming fiscal crisis, the
report shows.
</P>
<P>
	   In a February 1998 memo, Klagholz was briefed about "the lack of internal
controls in Newark's central office" and a "poor" communication between school
and state officials. The memo writer, one of Klagholz's top lieutenants, asked
the commissioner to personally intervene with Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   A year later Klagholz wrote a memo to Hall warning her that unresolved
budget problems "are becoming an unacceptable vulnerability both for you and the
department." But by that point, both the commissioner and the superintendent had
both submitted their resignations.
</P>
<P>
	   Hespe said state officials crafted solutions but did not act upon them.
</P>
<P>
	   The state could have withheld state aid, ordered corrections, or fired
school officials, but did not, the commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
	   The commissioner could not rule out possible criminal behavior. He said the
full dimensions of the budget mess won't be known until the final audits are
complete later this spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats railed against the department's record of inaction.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is memo after memo of people covering themselves instead of taking
action," Assemblyman Rudy Garcia, D-Hudson, said of the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican leaders, meanwhile, called on the state auditor to conduct a
thorough review of the school district's finances.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is February. They were going to do it in July. I said speed it up,"
said Assembly Speaker Jack Collins.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Mafia Hitman Gravano Arrested  </HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK GRAHAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Former Mafia hitman Salvatore ``Sammy the Bull'' Gravano, a
mob turncoat whose testimony helped put crime boss John Gotti behind bars, was
arrested Thursday for involvement with a drug ring, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gravano was not selling narcotics but helped finance the drug ring and was a
``mentor'' to the ring's leader, Michael Papa, the founding member of a white
supremacist gang, said Phoenix police spokesman Jeff Halstead.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-five members of the ring, which allegedly trafficked in the drug
ecstasy, were arrested including Papa, Gravano's wife, Debra; son Gerard;
daughter Karen; and son-in-law David Seabrook.
</P>
<P>
	   A judge set Gravano's bail at $5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Gravano, a confessed hitman, ravaged the Mafia by defecting to the
government, making headlines when he helped convict Gotti and dozens of other
gangland cronies. Authorities called him the most important mob turncoat in U.S.
history.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His primary testimony against the mob doesn't give him a free ride to
facilitate drug dealing in Arizona,'' state Attorney General Janet Napolitano
said.
</P>
<P>
	   His bombshell testimony, along with conversations secretly taped by the FBI,
finally put Gotti, the so-called ``Teflon Don,'' behind bars for life in 1992
after three previous acquittals.
</P>
<P>
	   Under his deal with prosecutors, Gravano admitted to 19 murders, but served
only five years for racketeering.
</P>
<P>
	   He then entered the federal witness protection program, but dropped out in
1997 saying he wanted to live normally, not always looking over his shoulder for
``some kid'' hoping to ``make a name for himself by taking me out.''
</P>
<P>
	   By 1999, he was making a new life in a Phoenix suburb, living under an
assumed name but telling a reporter for The Arizona Republic he didn't think he
was in any real danger.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not running from the (expletive) Mafia,'' Gravano told the Republic
last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Ron Kuby, who represents the families of Gravano's 19 murder
victims in a civil suit, said Gravano's insistence that he was repudiating his
criminal ways had been a scam.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wonder how the government officials who cozied up to this mobster must
feel. First they allow him to get away with 19 murders, then they turn him loose
to deal poison to the unsuspecting people of Arizona,'' Kuby said.
</P>
<P>
	   On its Web site Thursday, the Republic reported the ring targeted Phoenix
area teen-agers and rave music clubs. The drug operation allegedly sold upward
of 30,000 ecstasy pills a week.

<HEADLINE> Former Mafia hitman arrested in drug ring sweep  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PHOENIX (AP) - Former Mafia hitman Salvatore "Sammy the Bull" Gravano,
the mob turncoat whose testimony helped put crime boss John Gotti behind bars,
was charged Thursday with operating a statewide ecstasy ring, authorities said.
<P>
	   Gravano was arrested on one count of conspiracy to distribute dangerous
drugs, a felony carrying a 12 1/2-year prison sentence, said Arizona Attorney
General Janet Napolitano.
</P>
<P>
	   "His primary testimony against the mob doesn't give him a free ride to
facilitate drug dealing in Arizona," said Napolitano.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said Gravano bankrolled the ring and also headed its operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Gravano's wife, Debra, and other family members were also charged with being
involved in the ring, which police said distributed 20,000 to 30,000 ecstasy
pills a week in Phoenix and may have had links to other states. Each pill sold
for $20 to $30.
</P>
<P>
	   Ecstasy is a hybrid of the hallucinogen mescaline and the stimulant
amphetamine chemically known as MDMA. It has been shown in previous studies to
cause brain damage in animals at doses similar to those used by humans.
</P>
<P>
	   Among 36 alleged ring members in custody Thursday were Debra Gravano;
Gravano's son, Gerard; his daughter, Karen; her husband, David Seabrook; and
Michael Papa, another alleged ring leader.
</P>
<P>
	   Napolitano said 25 additional suspects could be arrested as part of the
investigation that began in August 1999. Additional charges also could be filed
against Gravano and his associates, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   A judge set Gravano's bail at $5 million cash, Napolitano said. Papa's bail
was set at $1 million; bail for the others ranged from $250,000 to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Papa had at one time worked for Gravano's construction company, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities still aren't sure who was supplying the organization with the
drugs, which are produced in Europe, said Tom Raffanello, head of the Drug
Enforcement Administration's Phoenix office.
</P>
<P>
	   Gravano, a confessed serial hitman, ravaged the Mafia by defecting to the
government, making headlines when he helped convict Gotti and dozens of other
gangland cronies. Authorities called him most important mob turncoat in U.S.
history.
</P>
<P>
	   His bombshell testimony, along with conversations secretly taped by the FBI,
finally put Gotti, the so-called "Teflon Don," behind bars for life in 1992
after three previous acquittals.
</P>
<P>

<P>
	   He then entered the federal witness protection program, but dropped out in
December 1997 saying he wanted to live normally, not always looking over his
shoulder for "some kid" hoping to "make a name for himself by taking me out."
</P>
<P>
	   By 1999, the 54-year-old was making a new life in a Phoenix suburb.
</P>
<P>
	   Neighbors of his wife, Debra, said they knew about the connection to Sammy
the Bull but didn't worry about it.
</P>
<P>
	   Kay Gianopulos, 71, who lives down the street from the Gravano house, said,
"We just decided to not spread the word who lived there. We felt that they had a
right to live their life."
</P>
<P>
	   Gravano, who was living under an assumed name, told The Arizona Republic
last summer that he didn't think he was in any real danger.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not running from the (expletive) Mafia," Gravano said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce Cutler, attorney for jailed mob boss John Gotti, said Thursday that he
planned to call Gotti at the federal prison in Marion, Ill., to pass on word of
Gravano's arrest - hopefully in the next week.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can't change the nature of a man ... He is a reprobate, a craven liar,"
Cutler said at a news conference in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Ron Kuby, who represents the families of Gravano's 19 murder
victims in an ongoing civil suit, said Gravano's insistence that he was
repudiating his criminal ways had been a scam.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wonder how the government officials who cozied up to this mobster must
feel. First they allow him to get away with 19 murders, then they turn him loose
to deal poison to the unsuspecting people of Arizona. There ought to be a couple
of FBI agents, U.S. attorneys and one federal judge named as accomplices," Kuby
said.

	   PLAINFIELD, Ind. (AP) -- Leaders of two orthodox Muslim groups long at odds
with Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam are expected to attend Farrakhan's annual
gathering this weekend, raising the prospect that the religion's fractured U.S.
followers may eventually unite.
</P>
<P>
	   Mainstream Islamic leaders from other nations also planned to attend the
Nation of Islam Saviour's Day events in Chicago and will look for signs that
Farrakhan's group is embracing orthodox Islamic beliefs, a leader of the key
immigrant Muslim group in this country said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They want to watch this transformation,'' said Sayyid Syeed, secretary
general of the Islamic Society of North America. ``They will be disappointed if
that transformation does not take place. There should at least be some
commitment in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Farrakhan and W. Deen Mohammed, the son of Nation of Islam
founder Elijah Muhammad and head of the black and orthodox Muslim American
Society, have scheduled a joint news conference Friday. The Islamic Society and
other mainstream Muslims recognize Mohammed's group as orthodox.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan and other Nation of Islam leaders did not return calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   However, an article posted Feb. 16 on the Nation of Islam's Web site quoted
Ishmael Muhammad, an assistant to Farrakhan, as saying a ``mega-highlight'' of
the Saviour's Day weekend would be the unification of the Nation of Islam with
followers of W. Deen Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
	   Mohammed, who confirmed that he planned to attend the gathering, said the
three groups would not be uniting under one name. He said he would be taking
particular note of Farrakhan's speech on Sunday, and hoped Farrakhan steers
clear of anti-white and anti-Semitic comments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We expect a different Farrakhan,'' Mohammed, 66, said Thursday from his
office in Calumet City, Ill. ``And if he's not and he comes out the wrong way
Sunday, I think he's really going to finish things for himself. Nobody will ever
trust him again.''
</P>
<P>
	   About a month ago, Mohammed met with Farrakhan, who was battling prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan, 66, said last December that a ``near-death experience'' earlier
in the year had left him a changed man. Since then he has stressed unity for all
races and religions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know if it was his fear of dying or a combination of things ...
that have really caused him to be very sincere about the unity of Muslims -- at
least one voice, a language of unity that does not conflict the picture of
Muslims in America,'' Mohammed said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mohammed said his organization has more than 2 million followers. The Nation
of Islam, which does not release membership figures, is estimated to have about
200,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Syeed acknowledged the Nation of Islam would need time, perhaps years, to
completely move away from Elijah Muhammad's original doctrines, including a
belief that whites are ``devils.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, he said moves in recent years to observe the Friday prayers and to
fast during the holy month of Ramadan had left him encouraged the Nation of
Islam would fully embrace orthodoxy within four or five years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have noticed a desire on his part to introduce his followers to
mainstream Islam. We understand that these things cannot happen overnight,''
Syeed said in an interview Wednesday at the Islamic Society's headquarters in
Plainfield, near Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
	   Syeed said he will speak Saturday on fundamental principles of Islam and the
need for the Nation of Islam to join a universal Islamic alliance in the United
States. His society says it represents 4 million Muslims in the United States,
most of them immigrants from Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Orthodox leaders are eager for Farrakhan's group to embrace conventional
beliefs as fast-growing Islam seeks to join the American mainstream. Syeed said
normalization would bolster the image of the religion, which many Americans
associate chiefly with terrorist acts by Muslim activists abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   Anti-white and anti-Semitic statements from Farrakhan and the Nation of
Islam did nothing to help that public relations problem, Syeed said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Demonization has been our major challenge in America,'' said Syeed, who
directs the day-to-day activities of the Islamic Society, an umbrella
organization of 500 Islamic groups.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nation of Islam has held its own interpretation of the Muslim creed,
``There is no god but God and Mohammed is his prophet.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Farrakhan group has believed that God became incarnate in W.D. Fard of
Detroit, who was Elijah Muhammad's teacher, and that Muhammad is the final
prophet to mankind. Orthodox Muslims believe the final prophet was Mohammed of
Mecca, who founded Islam in the seventh century.
</P>
<P>
	   Elijah Muhammad led the Nation of Islam for decades, but after his death in
1975 his son W. Deen led the movement toward orthodoxy. Farrakhan then
re-established the Nation of Islam in 1978 and followed Muhammad's original
doctrines.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan's initiatives brought a cautious reaction from Marilyn Mayo of the
Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish organization based in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to be skeptical because Farrakhan really is a master of words. We
have to see if he follows through with deeds,'' she said. ``In the past he has
talked about atonement many times but at various events has still fueled the
crowd with anti-Semitic and racist rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mayo also noted that the Nation of Islam Web site provides links to other
sites that post anti-Semitic material.
</P>
<P>
	   Professor Lawrence Mamiya of Vassar College, who is completing a major
survey of black Islamic groups, said he had doubts about Farrakhan's willingness
to completely embrace orthodox Islam.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that he would like the orthodox Muslim world to accept his group
as a sect of Islam, with its own peculiarities and practices, but many orthodox
Muslims are very critical of his attempt to keep remnants of the old Nation,''
Mamiya said. ``It's a question how far he's willing to go. I doubt that he will
make the change completely.''

<HEADLINE> Lautenberg endorses Corzine over Florio in U.S. Senate race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg is endorsing fellow
self-made millionaire Jon Corzine as the Democratic nominee to replace him on
Capitol Hill.
<P>
	   The endorsement will give Corzine a prized edge in his race against former
Gov. Jim Florio in the Democratic Party primary for Lautenberg's seat.
Lautenberg last year announced his retirement after 18 years of representing New
Jersey in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Lautenberg said he made the endorsement in the hope of ending the bickering
between the two that many fear is damaging the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this is a point in time when it's important for us to kind of
declare ourselves. A poll shows him way behind," Lautenberg said of Corzine.
"He's got an imminently good chance of taking the front place in this race, and
I want to help him do it."
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to try to eliminate as much as we can what kind of conflict or
contest we're going to have here," the senator said. "I want to get out of a
squabble as much as is possible."
</P>
<P>
	   The Corzine campaign said Lautenberg's backing would give their candidate
"an enormous stamp of credibility among core Democrats."
</P>
<P>
	   The Florio campaign regretted and dismissed the endorsement. "We are of
course disappointed, but it hasn't changed our strategy, which is not to play
the endorsement game," said Michael Murphy, a cochairman of the Florio campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy said Florio maintains his appeal with rank-and-file party members
among whom Corzine is unknown. He said, "Standing next to Frank Lautenberg does
not automatically overcome a difficult disadvantage, and a virtually
insurmountable one, which is: 'Jon Who?' "
</P>
<P>
	   Lautenberg was to make his endorsement formal with a public statement at the
Bergen County Democratic Party convention Thursday night in Hackensack.
</P>
<P>
	   In choosing the political newcomer over one of New Jersey's most
battle-scarred veterans, Lautenberg also is turning his back on a former
congressional colleague. Florio was in the House of Representatives when
Lautenberg arrived in Washington, and the two cosponsored key environmental
measures such as the Superfund cleanup law. Florio left the House in 1990 to
become governor.
</P>
<P>
	   "My regard is high for Jim Florio," Lautenberg said. "I think the times have
changed, and it is now time to look forward."
</P>
<P>
	   Lautenberg said he would back Florio vigorously, should he win the
nomination over Corzine on June 6.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic political consultant Pat Politano said he could be taken at his
word. "U.S. senators have a tendency to make friends very fast," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes Senate politics for the Cook Political Report
in Washington, said Lautenberg's move "is fascinating."
</P>
<P>
	   "It breaks with tradition, certainly, of members who stay out of contested
primaries for people who are vying to succeed them," Duffy said. "Finally they
are admitting publicly what we know has been going on behind the scenes: The
establishment backs Jon Corzine."
</P>
<P>
	   Duffy disagrees with Murphy that Corzine's anonymity is a threat. "With or
without Lautenberg, he could probably do it in sheer dollars for ads and phone
banks and mail."
</P>
<P>
	   Like Corzine, Lautenberg was a millionaire executive who had climbed the
corporate ladder from a working-class background and who late in his career
stepped away from the business world to run for national office.
</P>
<P>
	   Corzine was chairman of Goldman Sachs and is largely funding his own
campaign. Neither he nor Lautenberg had been elected to any office prior to
pursuing a U.S. Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
	   "He is the perfect one to carry it out. We share our views. He is a
self-made man," Lautenberg said. "There is a commonality of view when a business
person comes into the picture."
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Goldstein, co-manager of the Corzine campaign and former aide to
Lautenberg, said the retiring senator's endorsement was "the honor of a
political lifetime" because "he is one of the two or three great senators of the
last 40 years in this country."
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, U.S. Rep. Bob Franks, R-New Providence; state Sen.
William Gormley, R-Atlantic; Essex County executive Jim Treffinger; and former
Libertarian candidate for governor Murray Sabrin have announced plans to run.
Gov. Christie Whitman had been an early favorite in the contest before
withdrawing her name in September.

<HEADLINE> Another Media Marriage Doing Fine  </HEADLINE>
   By JOSH L. DICKEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Love, with the proper stranger, can work out.
</P>
<P>
	   Elizabeth and David Weinlick offer themselves up as proof.
</P>
<P>
	   Just like the couple on ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' they met
and married people they barely knew in elaborately planned media events.
</P>
<P>
	   But while the TV couple's marriage is headed for annulment, the Weinlicks
have enjoyed wedded bliss since June 13, 1998 -- the day David Weinlick asked
friends and family to choose a bride for him from a crop of candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   They were married on the spot at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn.,
drawing a crowd of 2,000 people and worldwide media attention.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, Weinlick said he had grown tired of being asked when he was
going to get married. For years, he told anyone who asked that he'd be married
by June 13, 1998 -- a date he chose arbitrarily.
</P>
<P>
	   A friend, Steven Fletcher, eventually suggested that Weinlick allow others
to help choose the bride. Weinlick accepted the challenge and put Fletcher in
charge of the process.
</P>
<P>
	   On a smaller scale, the Weinlicks' nuptials were a lot like the attention
given the Fox network's television special that aired Feb. 15 and drew more than
22 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
	   With all of the controversy arising from that show, the Weinlicks are again
the subjects of media attention -- and they're quick to defend their own
get-married-quick union.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Weinlick watched the show and taped it for her husband, who ``got his
fill of it in a few minutes,'' fast-forwarding through most of the two-hour
special.
</P>
<P>
	   The Weinlicks said the series of multiple-choice questions and
beauty-pageant atmosphere weren't conducive to a good match, a sober commitment,
or a lasting choice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There were probably lots of women there (who) weren't serious about it,''
Weinlick said. ``That's what we were doing during the 5 1/2 hours of
interviewing candidates -- finding out who was really ready to do this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Weinlick had distributed leaflets about his wish to marry and took
nominations for the woman of his dreams over a Web site. Many women learned of
his plan through news stories around the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Candidates to be Weinlick's bride began arriving at the mall's rotunda at 10
a.m. on the day of the wedding. By 3:30 p.m., most of Dave's friends were locked
in on Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
	   She had spoken briefly with Weinlick while dropping off her application, and
decided upon her first impression that she was prepared to take the unusual
arrangement all the way to death-do-us-part.
</P>
<P>
	   They insist that it was their attitude coming in that has allowed them to
succeed. Theirs was no made-for-TV stunt, but a union of two people who were
serious about a committed, long-term relationship -- and trusting of Dave's
extensive network of friends and family to choose his bride wisely.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the Fox-TV wedding, groom Rick Rockwell has defended himself against a
claim that he threatened an ex-girlfriend. And bride Darva Conger said on ``Good
Morning America'' Wednesday that she never wanted to marry Rockwell, that the
couple barely spoke in their short time together, and that she cried on the
plane en route to the newlyweds' honeymoon cruise in Barbados.
</P>
<P>
	   John Singh, a licensed marriage counselor from the area, said the success of
the Weinlicks' marriage is unusual, but not impossible. He added that ``if the
marriage is not based on love, honesty, and communication, it will be in
jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Weinlicks say they've been lucky to have a successful marriage, but have
also worked hard at it.
</P>
<P>
	   The Weinlicks have heard of other couples hoping to repeat their success,
but so far they know of none that have done it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People have to examine why they want to do it,'' Mrs. Weinlick said.
``Don't do it because you're burnt out on dating, or because you're dying to get
married. Do it because you think it's a good way to build a healthy
relationship.''

<HEADLINE> Barak Defends Threat Against Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
   By RON KAMPEAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak defended his foreign minister on
Thursday for pledging to exact retributions for anti-Israel attacks launched
from Lebanon ``blood for blood, soul for soul, child for child.''
</P>
<P>
	   Barak's support for David Levy's remarks was likely to further attract Arab
fury, and was a sign of how far apart the sides are a month after peace talks
with Syria broke down.
</P>
<P>
	   Levy's pledge Wednesday that ``the ground of Lebanon will burn'' if militant
Islamic guerrillas expand their attacks beyond engaging Israeli troops in south
Lebanon, sparked outrage even among fellow Cabinet ministers. But Barak said the
remarks were appropriate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His remarks, in my mind, expressed the heavy responsibility we feel for
the security of Israel in opposing existing dangers even as we enter in the
decisive stage of the peace process,'' Barak told reporters in Jerusalem on
Thursday. ``I have no doubt that he did not intend to say that we plan on
hurting citizens, on the contrary.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lebanese guerrillas shrugged off the threats and attacked Israeli troops and
their allied militia in the Israeli-occupied zone of southern Lebanon. Lebanese
security officials said guerrillas attacked three positions held by Israeli
soldiers and their allied militia.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli artillery on Thursday night also bombarded suspected guerrilla
positions, the officials said. But there were no immediate reports of
casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the Lebanese Resistance Brigades, a group
backed by Hezbollah, claimed responsibility for the attacks, both saying their
fighters scored ``direct hits.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sheik Nabil Kaouk, the southern Lebanon commander of Hezbollah, the most
active of the guerrilla groups, said his men would fight on despite Israeli
strikes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The threats made in Israel (by Levy) revealed that we are facing a
terrorist and savage government,'' Kaouk told a student rally in the southern
city of Sidon. The students burned U.S. flags, as well as Israeli ones, to
protest perceived American support for Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak made an election pledge to pull Israeli troops out of a buffer zone in
southern Lebanon by July. Until recently, he has insisted that a withdrawal
would be part of an agreement with Syria, the main power in Lebanon. But in
recent days he has suggested that a unilateral withdrawal is also an option.
</P>
<P>
	   Pulling out without an agreement would likely be bloody -- a pullback from
other parts of Lebanon in 1985 drew heavy fire from Hezbollah guerrillas who
wanted to send a message to Israel that it better not contemplate a return.
</P>
<P>
	   It would also lack guarantees that the Iranian-backed Hezbollah -- which
refuses to acknowledge Israel's existence -- would not move into the south and
take its fight to Israel's northern villages.
</P>
<P>
	   That fear has guided Levy's escalation of rhetoric in recent weeks -- he
said as much in the Knesset when he admonished the Arab legislators walking out
of the plenum: ``This is a warning signal ... and this warning prevents
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Levy stood by his remarks, telling Israel radio: ``No one
should be mistaken: with a grave response, there is no one who can promise that
civilians will not be harmed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Yet some say the rhetoric, instead of stemming violence, has exacerbated the
breakdown in communications, especially by naming children as legitimate
targets.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These remarks don't contribute to reducing the tensions,'' Justice
Minister Yossi Beilin told Israel television.
</P>
<P>
	   Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss said: ``The children of Lebanon whom Levy
is threatening to kill will remain the torch of the resistance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian media repeated a theme that it has made familiar in recent weeks,
comparing Israel to the Nazis. State-run Damascus Radio said Levy ``impersonated
(Adolf) Hitler's image, posture, gestures and tone of voice.''
</P>
<P>
	   Barak revived stalled peace talks when he met with Syrian leaders in
Washington in December. Within a month, however, the talks collapsed over the
Golan Heights, the strategic plateau Israel captured from Syria in 1967.
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah then ratcheted up attacks on Israeli troops in southern Lebanon,
killing seven soldiers. Israeli strikes in retaliation for the deaths of
soldiers demolished three Lebanese power stations, injuring 15 civilians.

<HEADLINE> Traffic-Choked Bogota Breathes Free  </HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BAJAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- In the first experiment of its kind in Latin
America, Bogota's residents walked, biked, roller skated or took buses and taxis
to work on Thursday. But they did not drive.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor declared Thursday an auto-free day to force people to think about
improving life in this traffic-choked metropolis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're showing ourselves and the world that we can build on our dreams and
create a more livable city,'' Mayor Enrique Penalosa said.
</P>
<P>
	   From 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., private vehicles were barred from the capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Penalosa led a morning caravan of cyclists through streets that on workdays
are usually clogged with more than 800,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
	   At noon, he reported air pollution citywide was down 25 to 30 percent.
Contaminants rose a bit in the afternoon, however, when a typical Bogota deluge
dumped nearly an inch of rain on the city and bus backups occurred on flooded
streets.
</P>
<P>
	   Free of the chaotic traffic during the morning rush hour, most Bogotanos
were in festive spirits. Thousands cycled for pleasure, while mimes, dancers,
musicians and clowns performed at intersections. Some people even rode horses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Normally, it's like a war here in the morning,'' university professor
Alejandro Martinez said as he waited for a bus, the only means of mass transit
available Thursday in the Andean city of 7 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   City Hall said traffic accidents fell from an average of 120 to 25, a drop
of 79 percent. There were no injuries. Bogota averages three traffic fatalities
a day.
</P>
<P>
	   Bogota traffic jams are notoriously nerve-wracking. It's been two decades
since a new artery was built in the city, which has neither a metropolitan rail
nor public bus system, something Penalosa is bent on changing.
</P>
<P>
	   Within two years, Penalosa predicted 20 percent of Bogota's commuters would
be riding a new $350 million public bus system scheduled for launch later this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   The car-free day -- which European cities including Paris, Amsterdam, Munich
and Rome have experimented with since 1998 -- was only the latest Penalosa idea
to encourage civic consciousness.
</P>
<P>
	   In August 1998, he imposed a license-plate restriction that barred Bogotanos
from driving to work twice a week during rush hour. He also widened sidewalks
and prohibited parking on a main shopping avenue, initially provoking the ire of
merchants but eventually winning people over.
</P>
<P>
	   Penalosa also bought an exclusive country club and polo grounds in the
city's affluent north and turned them into a public park.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics accuse the mayor, whose terms ends Dec. 31, of demagoguery and say
he has presidential aspirations.
</P>
<P>
	   But surveys show 65 percent of Bogota residents supported the car-free day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A new culture has been born for us Latinos who don't know how to coexist
with nature,'' said Carlos Munoz, a teacher accompanying some 100 students on a
4-mile trek to a private high school in the city's north.
</P>
<P>
	   Munoz expected another class of Bogotano would have a good day Thursday.
City buses are usually plagued by muggings, and there were far more than the
usual quota of business executives aboard on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's going to be a banner day for the robbers,'' Munoz chuckled.

<HEADLINE> Texas Executes Convicted Killer  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL GRACZYK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A 62-year-old woman was executed by injection
Thursday after Gov. George W. Bush rejected her claim that she killed her fifth
husband in self-defense and deserved a reprieve.
</P>
<P>
	   Betty Lou Beets became the fourth woman to be executed in the United States
since the Supreme Court in 1976 allowed the death penalty to resume. She was the
second woman executed in Texas since the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
	   She gave no final statement as she lay strapped to the death chamber gurney.
She made no eye contact with the victim's family, but smiled at relatives
watching through a window at her side. She continued smiling as she slipped into
unconsciousness.
</P>
<P>
	   Death penalty opponents and domestic violence organizations had urged Bush
to grant Beets a 30-day delay, arguing it would be consistent with his
description of himself as a ``compassionate conservative'' in his presidential
campaign. The delay was Bush's only option, since the state parole board did not
recommend that her sentence be commuted to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   During his 5 1/2 years as governor, 120 convicted killers have been executed
in Texas. He has spared one condemned inmate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After careful review of the evidence of the case, I concur with the jury
that Betty Lou Beets is guilty of this murder,'' Bush said in a written
statement after returning to Texas from California, where he was campaigning for
the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm confident that the courts, both state and federal, have thoroughly
reviewed all the issues raised by the defendant.''
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said Beets shot and killed two of her husbands, but she was only
tried in the death of her fifth husband, Dallas Fire Captain Jimmy Don Beets,
nearly 17 years ago. Prosecutors said she killed him to collect his life
insurance and pension.
</P>
<P>
	   Beets and her lawyers insisted the former bartender-waitress was the victim
of years of domestic abuse and should be allowed to live.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans rejected an
appeal that accused the state of not following its own rules in reviewing Beets'
case. The arguments were dismissed Wednesday by a federal judge in Austin as a
delay tactic.
</P>
<P>
	   Beets' lawyers also took the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court, which
rejected it without comment.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the governor's office, Bush had received 2,108 phone calls and
letters opposing Beets' execution by Thursday afternoon, and 57 favoring it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A decision to stay the execution of Ms. Beets would demonstrate your
compassionate conservatism and that you are willing to do what is right even in
the face of potential criticism from your constituents,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson
wrote Bush on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Steven Hawkins, executive director of the National Coalition to Abolish the
Death Penalty, implored Bush to grant a reprieve ``so evidence of her being
battered ... may be fully evaluated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Far from receiving careful consideration, the role of domestic abuse in
Betty's crime has been continually swept under the rug by the Texas court
system,'' Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Beets, the last woman executed in Texas was Karla Faye Tucker, on
Feb. 3, 1998. Tucker hacked two people to death with a pickax but said she had a
religious conversion in prison and appealed for mercy. Bush was criticized for
mocking Tucker in a magazine interview last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Beets was the ninth convicted killer and the second in as many days to be
executed in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state.
</P>
<P>
	   She spent Thursday morning meeting with relatives. She declined to request a
final meal.
</P>
<P>
	   Her claims of domestic abuse surfaced only recently and were not a factor in
her 1985 trial, although one of her daughters, Faye Lane, in a tearful plea for
her mother's life, said this week her mother was acting in self-defense after
years of abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know that if the jury heard the truth about my momma, she only could
have done something like this if she'd been very scared or threatened,'' Lane
said.
</P>
<P>
	   James Beets, the murder victim's son, discounted claims of abuse, saying she
told friends her husband of 11 months had been the best thing to happen to her.
</P>
<P>
	   Betty Lou Beets also was convicted of shooting and wounding her second
husband, Bill Lane.
</P>
<P>
	   Acting on a tip two years after Jimmy Don Beets was reported missing from a
fishing trip, authorities found his body buried under a wishing well flower
garden in the yard of their trailer home. They also discovered nearby in another
shallow grave the body of husband No. 4, Doyle Barker, who had been missing for
four years.
</P>
<P>
	   Both had been shot in the back of the head and stuffed into blue sleeping
bags.
</P>
<P>
	   Beets blamed a son for Jimmy Don Beets' death. The son denied any
involvement and testified against her. Beets explained Barker's disappearance by
saying he left one day and never returned.
</P>
<P>
	   She blamed husband No. 2, Lane, for Barker's death. Although she was charged
in his death, she was never tried.
</P>
<P>
	   The Catholic bishops of Texas, long opponents of the death penalty, asked
Bush this week to follow the lead of Illinois and suspend executions. Bush has
refused.

<HEADLINE> 3 Accused of False Sex Claims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A mother, her son and another man were indicted Thursday for
trying to bilk the Archdiocese of Boston out of $850,000 by claiming sexual
abuse against a priest.
</P>
<P>
	   Sean Murphy, 35, his mother, Sylvia, 57, both of Lynn, and Byron Worth, 41,
of Ashburnham, were indicted on conspiracy and attempted larceny charges.
</P>
<P>
	   The trio claimed that Worth, Sean Murphy and his brother were sexually
abused by a priest when they were children, state Attorney General Tom Reilly
said. In 1998, Sean Murphy allegedly sought $850,000 from the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
	   Police determined that at the time of the alleged abuse, neither Murphy nor
Worth lived in the community where the abused supposedly occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   To support the scheme, Sylvia Murphy created phony school records showing
that the family had lived in the town more than two decades ago, Reilly's office
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Archdiocese spokesman John Walsh said no payments were made.
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy's brother, whose name was not released, was not charged.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Won't Pull Back Diplomat in US  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Marking an important date in Cuba's independence fight, a
senior communist official on Thursday defiantly declared that a Washington-based
diplomat targeted for expulsion will remain in the United States as long as
possible.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite U.S. allegations of spying, the diplomat, Jose Imperatori, has done
nothing wrong, said Ricardo Alarcon, the president of Cuba's National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He will remain,'' said Alarcon, who is President Fidel Castro's top
official on Cuba-U.S. affairs. ``We have not pulled him back and we are not
going to pull him back.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alarcon challenged U.S. State Department officials to ``present their
alleged proof'' and to ``not fear debate'' on the matter. ``They have the chance
to rectify and ask for forgiveness,'' Alarcon said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Immigration and Naturalization Service spokeswoman Maria
Cardona said that, if the diplomat has not left the United States by 1:30 p.m.
EST on Saturday, ``the appropriate agencies will take appropriate action as
necessary.'' She would not say what that action might be.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department officials said earlier that Imperatori's diplomatic
immunity could be terminated if he was not recalled, making him subject to U.S.
law and possible arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban ceremony marking the 105th anniversary of the ``Grito de Baire''
-- the Battle Cry of Baire -- was broadcast live on state television from the
town of Baire in eastern Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Issued in Baire on Feb. 24, 1895, the cry marked the beginning of Cuba's
second and last major war of independence against Spanish colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Cuba finds itself immersed in another kind of battle -- this time
against Cuban-Americans in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   For three months, the communist government has waged a national campaign
pressing for the return of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, who has been staying with
relatives in Miami since he was rescued off the coast of Florida on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's mother and others died when their boat sank during an attempt to
reach U.S. shores.
</P>
<P>
	   While Elian's father in Cuba is demanding his parental rights to the child,
the Miami relatives are fighting to keep the boy in the United States, saying
they can give him a better life off the communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has ruled that Elian should be returned to his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, but the custody dispute has dragged on while the Miami relatives try
different legal maneuvers aimed at keeping Elian in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba the fight has become a symbol of Castro's decades-long ideological
war against what he calls ``the Miami mafia'' -- Cuban-born Americans who oppose
him and his government.
</P>
<P>
	   Alarcon called the spying charges the result of ``the desperation of the
kidnappers,'' a term used here to describe Elian's relatives and others who
support keeping the boy in the United States. Cuba insists that the boy has been
``kidnapped'' and is being ``held hostage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban authorities say they believe the move to expel Imperatori from
Washington, and the related arrest of a Cuban-born INS official on spying
charges, are aimed at blocking Elian's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department on Saturday ordered Imperatori to leave the country
within seven days because of alleged links with Mariano Faget, an INS supervisor
recently arrested in Miami on charges of spying for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said this week that it would be
highly unusual for a state to refuse to remove a diplomat under these
circumstances. Under the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations, he said,
Cuba must either recall the diplomat in question or terminate his functions.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the Cuban government has said its diplomatic mission in Washington
has not engaged in intelligence activities since it opened in 1977. And on
Thursday, the head of the mission, Fernando Remirez, officially informed the
State Department that Imperatori would not be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
	   Remirez was told ``in no uncertain terms'' that the U.S. government expects
him to leave and that he would lose his diplomatic privileges if he remains, an
administration official said on condition of anonymity.

<HEADLINE> WTO Protesters Eye the Capital  </HEADLINE>
   By REBECCA SINDERBRAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many of the same activists who protested World Trade
Organization talks in Seattle last year have picked a new venue for mass
demonstrations ---- this time, within shouting distance of the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers say they expect several thousand people to participate in 10 days
of events set to coincide with the April meetings of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are taking off from where Seattle left off,'' said organizer Deborah
Rephan.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 100 groups are planning activities, ranging from educational
puppet shows to full-blown protests. Many are also planning civil disturbances
in other cities nationwide and overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers say Seattle was merely a ``coming-out party.'' Hundreds of
activists are attending ``nonviolence training seminars'' to prepare, said
organizer Juliette Beck.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a task force of D.C.-based law enforcement agencies has been
meeting for several weeks to ``share intelligence and planning,'' said Lt. Dan
Nichols of the U.S. Capitol Police.
</P>
<P>
	   The task force includes the Metropolitan Police Department, U.S. Park
Police, Capitol Police and other law enforcement organizations, said Nichols.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We had (Capitol Police) agents in Seattle,'' and saw what went wrong when
that city faced a similar challenge.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, swarms of demonstrators kept WTO officials and other
dignitaries from entering the Seattle convention center where discussions on a
new round of global trade talks were being held.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those in town to attend the talks were unable to leave their hotels,
and opening ceremonies were canceled. Most of the protests were peaceful, but
downtown Seattle suffered millions of dollars in property damage. Police
eventually moved in with rubber bullets and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
	   When the meeting ended three days later, demonstrators claimed victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Nichols said D.C. authorities may have an advantage over their counterparts
in Seattle, however, because capital officials have much experience with large
events.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will respect the protesters' First Amendment rights, but we will not
tolerate any kind of disruptive activity,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Norway Debates US-Built Radar  </HEADLINE>
   By DOUG MELLGREN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- A U.S.-built radar facility on Norway's arctic frontier
with Russia is causing debate in this small NATO nation because of claims that
it is really an American spy station.
</P>
<P>
	   The 132-foot-tall Globus II radar being built near the north Norway town of
Vardoe is just a few miles from Russian military bases on the Kola Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
	   Officially, the giant radar facility, 400 miles north of the Arctic Circle,
will track space junk, the thousands of manmade objects in orbit around the
Earth, when operations begin next year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't believe it, but I can understand Norway's political leadership has
been kept in the dark (by the intelligence service) because this is such high
technology,'' Einar Hanssen, a retired top-ranking Norwegian intelligence
officer, said in a radio interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Many critics claim the radar is really part of a U.S. missile defense system
that is being developed and could violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, the Pentagon said the facility was being erected solely for
space-tracking purposes and would be owned and operated by Norwegians, not
Americans. It is equipment formerly installed at Vandenberg Air Force Base in
California that was transferred to Norway in 1998 under a cooperative program.
</P>
<P>
	   Data from the facility is to be shared with the United States, but there is
no real-time connection to U.S. facilities, the Pentagon said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not or is not planned to be an element of any U.S. missile defense
program,'' the Pentagon said in the statement, adding it would have no
capability of spying on a Russian military base.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia, nevertheless, has complained about the new radar because it is just
25 miles from the border.
</P>
<P>
	   Norwegian lawmakers demanded an explanation from their government this week.
</P>
<P>
	   In her written reply Thursday, Norwegian Defense Minister Elbjoerg Loewer
said the radar monitors space junk, does research and monitors Norwegian
interests. She said it violates no treaties but gave no details of its
operations.

<HEADLINE> Damaging Testimony in Gov.'s Case  </HEADLINE>
   By NATALIE GOTT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- A former casino consultant tearfully told a federal
jury Thursday that he funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars in payoffs to
former Gov. Edwin Edwards and his son Stephen -- before and after Edwards left
office in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricky Shetler's testimony, backed by Shetler's own ledgers and conversations
secretly recorded by the FBI, was the most damaging to date in Edwards'
six-week-old federal racketeering trial -- and in the 40-year public life of the
scandal-plagued four-term governor.
</P>
<P>
	   By his own count, Edwards, 72, has been the subject of almost two dozen
state or federal investigations going back to his days as a congressman in the
'60s. In 1985, he was acquitted on federal racketeering charges involving health
care investments.
</P>
<P>
	   Known for his deadpan wit, Edwards has maintained a confident air throughout
this trial, despite a growing body of evidence against him. He has been
restrained from commenting on the evidence by the judge's gag order.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors say Edwin and Stephen Edwards and five other men took
part in a series of schemes to manipulate the licensing of riverboat casinos.
The ex-governor could face 350 years in prison and $7.2 million in fines if
convicted. Stephen could get 305 years.
</P>
<P>
	   As governor, Edwards appointed the now-defunct Louisiana Riverboat Gaming
Commission, which granted preliminary approval for riverboat licenses. And he
appointed the head of State Police, which issued the licenses.
</P>
<P>
	   Shetler, a lifelong friend of Stephen Edwards, turned on the Edwards family
in 1998, pleading guilty to extortion conspiracy charges and agreeing to
cooperate with federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   He fought back tears on the witness stand Thursday as federal prosecutor
Peter Strasser asked him how he felt about testifying against his friends.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Terrible,'' Shetler replied in a shaky voice while Stephen Edwards looked
on stoically. ``I feel terrible.''
</P>
<P>
	   Shetler said he gave the Edwardses cash, cars, furniture, appliances and
vacations in return for their help in getting state approval for two Players
riverboat casinos at Lake Charles and for hindering competition.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors reviewed ledgers with Shetler in which he had detailed his
payments to Stephen and Edwin Edwards. And they played tapes of conversations
secretly recorded in Edwin Edwards' law office in 1997 -- when Edwards allegedly
was continuing to accept payoffs for things he did before leaving office the
year before.
</P>
<P>
	   In one conversation, on Jan. 9, 1997, Stephen Edwards tells his father:
``I've got to get with Shetler because he still owes you the big check from
November and all of December. That should be six, seven, eight, nine thousand
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a Feb. 25 conversation in the same office, Edwards appears to be making
sure he does not have to deal directly with the money.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen Edwards: ``Shetler's been calling me. I think I should just stay in
and meet with him. He's coming in with your money.''
</P>
<P>
	   Edwin Edwards: ``I'd rather you do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors have portrayed Players executives as the victims of
extortion rather than participants in a bribery scheme, although some former
executives testified under grants of immunity.
</P>
<P>
	   The case brought pressure on Louisiana gambling regulators to revoke the
company's licenses for its two Lake Charles riverboats. The company eventually
agreed to pay the state $10.8 million and get out of Louisiana.

<HEADLINE> Traffic-Choked Bogota Breathes Free  </HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BAJAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- In the first experiment of its kind in Latin
America, Bogota's residents walked, biked, roller skated or took buses and taxis
to work on Thursday. But they did not drive.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor declared Thursday an auto-free day to force people to think about
improving life in this traffic-choked metropolis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're showing ourselves and the world that we can build on our dreams and
create a more livable city,'' Mayor Enrique Penalosa said.
</P>
<P>
	   From 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., private vehicles were barred from the capital.
Excluded autos included motorcycles, big trucks and the armor-plated sport
utility vehicles favored by the business and political elite.
</P>
<P>
	   Penalosa led a morning caravan of cyclists through streets that on workdays
are usually clogged with more than 800,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
	   At noon, he reported air pollution citywide was down 25 to 30 percent.
Contaminants rose a bit in the afternoon, however, when a typical Bogota deluge
dumped nearly an inch of rain on the city and bus backups occurred on flooded
streets.
</P>
<P>
	   Free of the chaotic traffic during the morning rush hour, most Bogotanos
were in festive spirits. Thousands cycled for pleasure, while mimes, dancers,
musicians and clowns performed at intersections. Some people even rode horses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Normally, it's like a war here in the morning,'' university professor
Alejandro Martinez said as he waited for a bus, the only means of mass transit
available Thursday in the Andean city of 7 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   City Hall said traffic accidents fell from the daily average of 120 to 25, a
drop of 79 percent. There were no injuries. Bogota averages three traffic
fatalities a day.
</P>
<P>
	   Bogota traffic jams are notoriously nerve-wracking. It's been two decades
since a new artery was built in the city, which has neither a metropolitan rail
nor public bus system, something Penalosa is bent on changing.
</P>
<P>
	   Within two years, Penalosa predicted 20 percent of Bogota's commuters would
be riding a new $350 million public bus system scheduled for launch later this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   The car-free day -- which European cities including Paris, Amsterdam, Munich
and Rome have experimented with since 1998 -- was only the latest Penalosa idea
to encourage civic consciousness.
</P>
<P>
	   In August 1998, he imposed a license-plate restriction that barred Bogotanos
from driving to work twice a week during rush hour. He also widened sidewalks
and prohibited parking on a main shopping avenue, initially provoking the ire of
merchants but eventually winning people over.
</P>
<P>
	   Penalosa created controversy with a proposal to buy an exclusive country
club and polo grounds in the city's affluent north and turn them into a public
park.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics accuse the mayor, whose terms ends Dec. 31, of demagoguery and say
he has presidential aspirations.
</P>
<P>
	   But surveys show 65 percent of Bogota residents supported the car-free day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A new culture has been born for us Latinos who don't know how to coexist
with nature,'' said Carlos Munoz, a teacher accompanying some 100 students on a
4-mile trek to a private high school in the city's north.
</P>
<P>
	   Munoz expected another class of Bogotano would have a good day Thursday.
City buses are usually plagued by muggings, and there were far more than the
usual quota of business executives aboard on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's going to be a banner day for the robbers,'' Munoz chuckled.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Fall in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index inched lower early
Friday, largely unaffected by a decline on Wall Street. The dollar was higher
against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 15.17 points, or 0.08
percent, to 19,556.27 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Thursday, the
average closed up 51.89 points, or 0.27 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 111.32 yen, up 0.26 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and
also above its late New York level of 111.06 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei moved in a narrow range between negative and
positive territory amid caution about the direction of U.S. stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders said the Tokyo market's downside was supported on hopes for buying
from newly established investment trust funds and the record close in the
technology-rich Nasdaq composite index in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 133.10 at
10,092.63 amid worries about rising interest rates. At one point it briefly fell
below 10,000 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq, however, finished up 67.32 to 4,617.65, reaching a new closing
high for the second day in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 5.97 points, or 0.35 percent, to 1,696.02. The TOPIX closed up
22.81 points, or 1.37 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar moved slightly higher early Friday in Asia
amid no major market-moving news.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 110.26 yen, down from 110.84 yen
late Thursday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.8550
percent from Thursday's finish of 1.8700 percent. Its price rose 0.12 point to
99.53.

Environmental Groups Unlikely To Back Endangered-Species Legislation
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Not a single environmental group is expected to endorse
federal endangered-species legislation about to be introduced by Environment
Minister David Anderson.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists who had hoped Anderson's appointment signalled a new
seriousness on environmental issues on the part of the Liberal government say
privately their hopes have been dashed.
</P>
<P>
	   Canadian activists have restricted themselves to relatively subdued comments
on the record.
</P>
<P>
	   The frontal attack came from U.S. activists, invited to Ottawa by Canadian

	   ``The bill claims to be an endangered species law but there's not one word
in it which requires any Canadian official to protect even one single animal --
ever,'' said Brock Evans, executive director of the U.S. Endangered Species
Coalition, representing more than 400 U.S. environmental groups.

<P>
	   Evans said U.S. efforts to preserve biodiversity are being undermined by
weak protection for endangered species, from Monarch butterflies to grizzly

	    First Indo-Canadian Provincial Leader Sworn in As British Columbia Premier
</P>
<P>
	   VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) -- A self-described poor boy from India's
Punjab made Canadian history Thursday when he was sworn in as British Columbia's
33rd premier.
</P>
<P>
	   Ujjal Dosanjh smiled from ear to ear as he took an oath of office from
Lt.-Gov. Garde Gardom at Government House.
</P>
<P>
	   Dosanjh, elected New Democratic Party leader last Sunday, is the first
Indo-Canadian premier in Canadian history.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I started my journey on Dec. 31, 1964, leaving India at the age of
17, little did I know, think or imagine that I would stand here before you today
being called Premier Dosanjh.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dosanjh replaces Dan Miller, who served as interim premier following former
premier Glen Clark's resignation last August.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark resigned after it was revealed he was part of an ongoing police
gambling probe.

	    Spending Taps on Full blast in Alberta's Pre-Election-Year Budget 2000
</P>
<P>
	   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- The spending taps will be on full blast in
Alberta's pre-election year 2000 -- continuing a trend of binge-spending made
possible by rocketing revenues.
</P>
<P>
	   The provincial budget tabled Thursday promised pots more money to hire
teachers, doctors and nurses, fix roads and schools, and help seniors and
students.
</P>
<P>
	   Tax changes mean a two-parent family with $50,000 in income and two kids
will pay $907 less in provincial tax as of Jan. 1. And 132,000 low-income
earners will pay no provincial income tax at all.
</P>
<P>
	   User fees are being cut immediately by $60 million a year for everything
from court fees to land title searches. For those buying a $150,000 house with a
$140,000 mortgage, it used to cost $365 in fees to do the legal paperwork. As of
this morning, it costs $133.
</P>
<P>
	   Alberta will spend a record $17.7 billion this year. But it expects to take
in $19.1 billion, thanks to an economy hitting on all cylinders with high oil
and gas prices, a burgeoning manufacturing and high-tech sector and a population
that will hit three million this spring.
</P>
<P>
	    Ottawa, Provinces Announce $400 Million Farm Relief Package
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Another $400 million in emergency aid for Prairie grain
farmers was denounced Thursday by protesting producers as a ``joke'' that falls
short of their needs.
</P>
<P>
	   Several accused Saskatchewan Premier Roy Romanow of selling out farmers,
only minutes after he joined his Manitoba counterpart Gary Doer and Prime
Minister Jean Chretien to announce the federal-provincial aid package.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're an endangered species, we're a species extinct, we're gone,'' said
Arlynn Kurtz, who farms near Stockholm in southeastern Saskatchewan.
</P>
<P>
	   ''(Romanow) says we need . . . $3 billion and he sold us out for $1 billion
and some of it is already in programs that are in effect,'' added Kurtz.
</P>
<P>
	   Saskatchewan farmers will receive a total of about $1 billion this year
through such programs as crop insurance and the Agriculture Income Disaster
Assistance program, said Romanow.
</P>
<P>
	   Manitoba farmers will receive $100 million in payments that could amount to
between $8,000 and $11,000 per farm family by early spring, said Doer.

	    Coroner's Jury Finds Little Girl's Death a Homicide
</P>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- The death of a little girl who went to hospital suffering
nothing more than pain from a leg broken six months earlier has been ruled a
homicide.
</P>
<P>
	   But while a coroner's jury found the world-renowned Hospital for Sick
Children caused 10-year-old Lisa Shore's death on Oct. 22, 1998, that doesn't
necessarily mean the hospital is criminally culpable.
</P>
<P>
	   A verdict of homicide by a coroner's jury is considered a finding of fact,
not fault or legal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
	   Toronto police said Thursday they must still review the jury's findings
before deciding whether to lay charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Lisa's mother Sharon, who wept as the jury's finding was read aloud
Thursday, immediately demanded a police investigation, the dismissal of hospital
staff involved in her daughter's care and a public inquiry.
</P>
<P>
	   The family's lawyer wants to know why Shore's young daughter, with morphine
pumping into her body, did not have her vital signs checked hourly, as her
doctor had instructed.

<HEADLINE> Texas Executes Convicted Killer  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL GRACZYK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A 62-year-old woman was executed by injection
Thursday after Gov. George W. Bush rejected her claim that she killed her fifth
husband in self-defense and deserved a reprieve.
</P>
<P>
	   Betty Lou Beets became the fourth woman to be executed in the United States
since the Supreme Court in 1976 allowed the death penalty to resume. She was the
second woman executed in Texas since the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
	   She gave no final statement as she lay strapped to the death chamber gurney.
She made no eye contact with the victim's family, but smiled at her attorney and
a spiritual adviser watching through a window at her side. She continued smiling
as she slipped into unconsciousness.
</P>
<P>
	   Death penalty opponents and domestic violence organizations had urged Bush
to grant Beets a 30-day delay, arguing it would be consistent with his
description of himself as a ``compassionate conservative'' in his presidential
campaign. The delay was Bush's only option, since the state parole board did not
recommend that her sentence be commuted to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   During his 5 1/2 years as governor, 120 convicted killers have been executed
in Texas. He has spared one condemned inmate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After careful review of the evidence of the case, I concur with the jury
that Betty Lou Beets is guilty of this murder,'' Bush said in a written
statement after returning to Texas from California, where he was campaigning for
the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm confident that the courts, both state and federal, have thoroughly
reviewed all the issues raised by the defendant.''
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said Beets shot and killed two of her husbands, but she was only
tried in the death of her fifth husband, Dallas Fire Captain Jimmy Don Beets,
nearly 17 years ago. Prosecutors said she killed him to collect his life
insurance and pension.
</P>
<P>
	   Beets and her lawyers insisted the former bartender-waitress was the victim
of years of domestic abuse and should be allowed to live.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans rejected an
appeal that accused the state of not following its own rules in reviewing Beets'
case. The arguments were dismissed Wednesday by a federal judge in Austin as a
delay tactic.
</P>
<P>
	   Beets' lawyers also took the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court, which
rejected it without comment.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the governor's office, Bush had received 2,108 phone calls and
letters opposing Beets' execution by Thursday afternoon, and 57 favoring it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A decision to stay the execution of Ms. Beets would demonstrate your
compassionate conservatism and that you are willing to do what is right even in
the face of potential criticism from your constituents,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson
wrote Bush on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Steven Hawkins, executive director of the National Coalition to Abolish the
Death Penalty, implored Bush to grant a reprieve ``so evidence of her being
battered ... may be fully evaluated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Far from receiving careful consideration, the role of domestic abuse in
Betty's crime has been continually swept under the rug by the Texas court
system,'' Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Beets, the last woman executed in Texas was Karla Faye Tucker, on
Feb. 3, 1998. Tucker hacked two people to death with a pickax but said she had a
religious conversion in prison and appealed for mercy. Bush was criticized for
mocking Tucker in a magazine interview last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Beets was the ninth convicted killer and the second in as many days to be
executed in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state.
</P>
<P>
	   She spent Thursday morning meeting with relatives. She declined to request a
final meal.
</P>
<P>
	   Her claims of domestic abuse surfaced only recently and were not a factor in
her 1985 trial, although one of her daughters, Faye Lane, in a tearful plea for
her mother's life, said this week her mother was acting in self-defense after
years of abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know that if the jury heard the truth about my momma, she only could
have done something like this if she'd been very scared or threatened,'' Lane
said.
</P>
<P>
	   James Beets, the murder victim's son, discounted claims of abuse, saying she
told friends her husband of 11 months had been the best thing to happen to her.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My dad was a Dallas fireman for 26 years,'' he said after witnessing the
execution. ``He lived to help people, not hurt people. I just hope now people
know and they can see my dad was a good man.''
</P>
<P>
	   Betty Lou Beets also was convicted of shooting and wounding her second
husband, Bill Lane.
</P>
<P>
	   Acting on a tip two years after Jimmy Don Beets was reported missing from a
fishing trip, authorities found his body buried under a wishing well flower
garden in the yard of their trailer home. They also discovered nearby in another
shallow grave the body of husband No. 4, Doyle Barker, who had been missing for
four years.
</P>
<P>
	   Both had been shot in the back of the head and stuffed into blue sleeping
bags.
</P>
<P>
	   Beets blamed a son for Jimmy Don Beets' death. The son denied any
involvement and testified against her. Beets explained Barker's disappearance by
saying he left one day and never returned.
</P>
<P>
	   She blamed husband No. 2, Lane, for Barker's death. Although she was charged
in his death, she was never tried.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I felt the 14 years she was down here done me no justice until today,''
Barker's son, Rodney, said after watching the execution. ``And I felt like the
state of Texas had done something for me finally as a victim. I want people to
know victims have rights too. We're tired of hearing about Betty Beets.''

<HEADLINE> Putin Urges Strengthening of Will  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM HEINTZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- In an ``open letter'' to his country, acting President
Vladimir Putin laments Russia's faltering will and failure to confront problems.
</P>
<P>
	   In the letter, to be published Friday in the newspaper Izvestia, Putin says
Russian authorities are increasingly losing face, according to excerpts
published by the news agency Interfax.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The state machinery is difficult to hold together; its engine, the
executive branch, creaks and sneezes whenever one tries to get it going,'' he
writes.
</P>
<P>
	   But some of Putin's challengers in the March 26 election have criticized him
for failing to propose solutions to Russia's severe and complex economic
problems. Putin has said an economic plan is being prepared, and will likely be
made public Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin was largely unknown to Russians before becoming prime minister in
August. Since taking the presidency on Dec. 31 after the surprise resignation of
Boris Yeltsin, he has made few specific policy statements.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, his statements have generally appealed to patriotism and morale.
``The moral fundamentals that one learns in his family and make up the core of
patriotism are important to the Russian citizen,'' his letter says.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls show Putin getting as much as 60 percent of the votes in the
11-candidate race. His support apparently reflects wide public approval of his
tough line on the offensive in Chechnya, where he has insisted that rebels must
be wiped out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A whole republic, a Russian region, Chechnya, was taken over by the
criminal world and turned into a fortress. But we attacked the gangsters and
defeated them,'' his letter says.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was the first step toward the pre-eminence of the law, to the
dictatorship of a law that treats everyone equally,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin's nearest challenger is Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, shown
in recent polls to have the support of 20 percent or less of voters.

<HEADLINE> McCain supporter challenging closed primary structure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A supporter of Sen. John McCain who had been an
independent voter is suing for the right to vote in New York's closed Republican
presidential primary March 7.
<P>
	   A federal judge is expected to hear arguments next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 2.2 million independent voters would be able to participate in New
York's Democratic and Republican primaries if Wendy Van Wie of Columbiaville
wins her lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, only voters registered with the party may vote in its primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of Texas Gov. George W. Bush's state supporters, including state GOP
Chairman William Powers, oppose allowing independents to vote in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Independent and Democratic voters helped push McCain to victory over Bush in
GOP primaries in New Hampshire and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   Van Wie, 46, had been independent but registered as a Republican after a
federal judge ordered that McCain be placed on the ballot statewide. But she was
told that state law would keep her from voting in a New York presidential
primary until 2004. Voters who switch or join parties after being uncommitted
must wait until after a presidential election to participate in the new party's
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   "I personally want to vote for John McCain," said Van Wie, who has asked a
federal judge to stop New York's political parties from barring independent
voters from their primaries. "I don't really care who anyone else votes for,
though. I just want people to be able to vote."
</P>
<P>
	   Van Wie's lawyer, Susan Galvin, said state law was discriminatory because
unregistered voters can wait until at least 20 days before a primary to register
with a party and vote.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you haven't bothered to register or you haven't bothered to exercise
your right to vote in the past, you get preferential treatment over somebody who
is registered and has voted," Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Galvin, Van Wie and Guy Molinari, co-chairman of McCain's New York campaign,
insisted Thursday that McCain's campaign was not behind the lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Creates New Ventures Wing  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- The Boeing Co. has created a New Ventures division to help
the company turn its patents and in-house technology -- including derivatives of
its core businesses -- into revenue producers, the company announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Anil Shrikhande, a former executive with the Moore Corp. and Unisys, will
head up the new effort, which will focus on using the Internet and other
"e-business" tools.
</P>
<P>
	   "This really boils down to taking all of the great work at Boeing, that
whole portfolio, and pulling it all together for new growth businesses,"
Shrikhande said.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing's move comes at a time when many large companies, seeing the
explosive growth of the Internet, are looking for ways to combine their
traditional strengths with the fast growth and reach of the Web. Shrikhande
would not give concrete examples of what kind of businesses Boeing might get
into, but the company has adapted earlywhen it comes to providing computerized
and Internet-related services.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing's parts store was one of the first major electronic-commerce
enterprises on the World Wide Web, and the company recently provided inventory
systems to British Airways. These new ventures will be along a similar vein,
company officials said, and will help boost the company's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
	   "The breadth of Boeing's reach is huge, and the depth of Boeing's knowledge
is incredible," said Boeing Chief Financial Officer Debby Hopkins. "Anil's job
will be taking all this and turning it into new businesses for us."
</P>
<P>
	   Shrikhande said there will be no one model for how the new ventures will be
incorporated into Boeing. Some will be services offered alongside traditional
products, such as the inventory management service, while others could be
entirely separate and draw from different business units. Still others might
even be spun off from the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing workers will be encouraged to collaborate within the company, and
Shrikhande said Boeing will forge alliances with outside companies to bring some
of the new ventures to fruition.
</P>
<P>
	   "This will simply be an incubator to grow new ideas and turn them into
working businesses," Shrikhande said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Police Arranged Deportations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Officers in the police precinct at the heart of a massive
corruption scandal had federal immigration agents deport at least 160 suspected
gang members and witnesses to police abuse, the Los Angeles Times reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rampart Division's elite anti-gang unit violated a 21-year-old policy by
seeking the deportations, the Times reported, citing senior Immigration and
Naturalization Service officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Rafael Perez, the former officer whose allegations started the scandal, told
investigators that witnesses to police abuse would be deported at the
instigation of the CRASH unit, which stands for Community Resources Against
Street Hoodlums.
</P>
<P>
	   Other deportees were on a list of 10,000 supposed members of the violent
18th Street gang in California and other states, the Times said.
</P>
<P>
	   Perez's allegations that Rampart CRASH officers beat, framed and shot
innocent people have led to the suspension of 20 officers and reversal of 40
criminal convictions. On Wednesday, the FBI announced it had joined the
investigation, while the state attorney general's office said it would expand
its own review of the ongoing LAPD investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the latest allegations, anti-gang officers in 1997 and 1998
repeatedly sought the deportation of Hispanic immigrants who did not appear to
be gang members, the Times said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I told my boss this was just ludicrous. They were targeting a whole race
of people,'' a senior INS agent said was quoted as saying in the Times. ``That's
not a gang anymore, that's a culture. They only wanted to do one thing: sweep
the street and turn the bodies over to the INS.''
</P>
<P>
	   At least 160 whose names were turned over to the INS's Organized Crime Drug
Enforcement Task Force were deported, and about 40 received prison sentences for
re-entering the country illegally, the Times said, citing an INS agent.
</P>
<P>
	   INS spokeswoman Virginia Kice said Thursday the agency's internal auditors
will look into the allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   Capt. Bob Hansohn, Rampart's commanding officer, said Thursday that he not
seen any such deportation activity since he took over in August 1998 with a
mandate to clean up the division. He never heard of a gang list of 10,000
people, he added.

<HEADLINE> Exiled Professor Returns to Georgia  </HEADLINE>
   By ELLIOTT MINOR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, Ga. (AP) -- As the choir sang freedom songs and mourners shouted
amens, Preston King dabbed his eyes during a funeral service Thursday for his
oldest brother.
</P>
<P>
	   The exiled professor who fled Georgia 39 years ago to avoid imprisonment for
draft evasion had missed the funerals of his parents and three other brothers.
But a presidential pardon allowed him to return to the United States from
England to bury his brother, Clennon W. King Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   Friends remembered Clennon King, 79, also a college professor, as a complex
man who was willing to stand up for his convictions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was a debater, a fighter,'' said Lois Jones, who was a classmate of
Clennon King. ``He was so stubborn, you couldn't change his mind.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clennon King, who died Feb. 12 after a three-year battle with prostate
cancer, was the first black person to apply for admission to the all-white
University of Mississippi. Instead of being considered, he was certified insane.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The governor felt that any African-American who would have enough nerve to
apply to go to Ole Miss must be crazy,'' Carol King, a family spokeswoman, told
The Albany Herald for his obituary.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1972, Clennon King ran for president. Then just days before the 1976
presidential election, he tried to desegregate Jimmy Carter's all-white Baptist
church in Plains, Ga. With the congregation split on the issue, Carter and his
supporters formed another church.
</P>
<P>
	   Preston King, 63, returned to the United States from England on Wednesday,
four decades after refusing induction into the Army in the 1960s because the
all-white draft board wouldn't address him as ``Mr.''
</P>
<P>
	   He fled his Albany home in 1961 to avoid an 18-month prison sentence for
draft evasion. President Clinton pardoned him Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   King plans to return Saturday to England, where he is a political science
professor at Lancaster University and his daughter is a member of Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Accused Spy for Cuba Defends Calls  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A U.S. immigration official charged with spying for Cuba was
denied bond Thursday after he told a federal judge he relayed supposedly secret
information only to protect a friend.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Magistrate Judge Barry Garber ordered Mariano Faget to await trial in
jail, citing the severity of the charges against him, the weight of evidence and
the fact that Faget admitted divulging information he believed to be classified.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say that on Feb. 11, Faget, 54, was given bogus information that
a U.S.-based Cuban diplomat was set to defect. Within minutes, Faget allegedly
went to his office, called a business associate with ties to Cuba on his
cellular phone, and told him ``a person we both know (is) ... one of the ones
working with the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Faget called the man from home and discussed the case in more detail,
the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities say Faget has been under investigation for a year. According to
court papers, Faget met with Cuban intelligence officials in Miami on at least
two occasions and contacted officials with the Cuban diplomatic mission in
Washington. One has been ordered to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget, a native of Havana who has been a U.S. citizen since 1963, is on paid
leave from his post as a supervisor in the Miami office of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to have my day in court to defend myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget told the judge that he called the business associate to protect him.
The associate, Pedro Font, 57, is a New York publicist Faget has known since the
1950s. Font was an associate of Faget's father, the head of an anti-communist
agency in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget and Font are also associates in America-Cuba, a company created to
promote business with Cuba once the U.S. trade embargo is lifted. Font hasn't
been charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors said Faget had no reason to warn Font he was in danger
and asked him whether he told FBI agents of his concern for Font's life. Faget
said he did not.
</P>
<P>
	   Edward O'Donnell Jr., Faget's attorney, argued that Faget would not benefit
from supporting Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba, because as long as Castro remains
in power, America-Cuba can't broker business deals there.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Curtis Minor argued against bond for Faget. He said authorities
found six passports and other identification cards in Faget's desk drawer,
indicating he might try to avoid the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has lied to his employer, lied to the FBI, deceived the federal
government, repeatedly lied to federal agents,'' Minor said. ``He's continued to
submit falsehood after falsehood.''
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing came a day after an American couple who were part of a Cuban
ring that spied on U.S. military installations and exile political groups were
sentenced to seven years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Linda and Nilo Hernandez pleaded guilty last year to being unregistered
agents of a foreign government. Three other people charged with being part of
the ring have been sentenced to prison terms between 3 1/2 years and seven
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Five others are scheduled to go on trial in May, while four have never been
captured.

<HEADLINE> Blackout Blamed on Rebel Suspects  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- A blackout that last week plunged a large portion of
Peru's capital into darkness was caused by suspected leftist rebels who bombed
an electric pylon, police said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The outage prompted a flood of phone calls to local radio stations by
panicky residents who remembered the systematic bombing campaign by leftist
rebels in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   The 230-foot tower carrying high tension transmission lines was dynamited 25
miles southeast of Lima on Feb. 18, causing a 40-minute power outage that
affected at least a fifth of the Capital's 8 million inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
	   In his bid for a third straight term in office, President Alberto Fujimori
has said that Peru risks a return to political chaos if he is not re-elected in
the April 9 vote.
</P>
<P>
	   The power outage last week was initially attributed to an unexplained
``technical failure'' with an electrical transmission line.
</P>
<P>
	   Remnants of the Maoist Shining Path insurgency have stepped up activity in
Peru's central highlands and jungle in recent weeks. Fighting with leftist
rebels has left 30,000 dead since 1980.

<HEADLINE> Lobbyists spent $17.9 million to influence legislation in 1999  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Spending by lobbyists seeking to sway lawmakers
reached record levels again in 1999, according to reports released Thursday by
the state Election Law Enforcement Commission.
<P>
	   The reports show special interests spent $17.9 million in the effort to get
laws passed or block proposed legislation. That's up 9 percent from the $16.4
million they spent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The lobbying efforts include $69,617 in "passing benefits" to public
officials. That includes dinners, conferences, golf outings, tickets to ball
games and other perks. This figure is down from the $107,197 that public
officials received in 1998. Except for 1998, the figure has consistently dropped
as lawmakers become more wary of public reports showing such gifts.
</P>
<P>
	   These reports show how much big lobbying firms took in and spent during
1999, but do not include which bills they fought over in a year marked by
battles over open space preservation, school construction, auto insurance, and
energy deregulation.
</P>
<P>
	   However, along with the big firms that serve as hired guns for issues,
several single-issue groups appear on the lists, including ones representing
hospitals, builders, phone companies, lawyers and teachers.
</P>
<P>
	   Frederick Herrmann, executive director of the Election Law Enforcement
Commission, said the cost of influencing lawmakers rises every year. He said
that's not the case with "benefit passing" - the perks to lawmakers, aides and
other public officials.
</P>
<P>
	   "Basically, the trend since 1982, when we started keeping records, is that
it keeps going up," Herrmann said. "However, the benefit passing part is flat.
We don't make value judgments, but the purpose of a disclosure law is to let the
public know if there's undue influence or not. People can conclude it's a good
thing when benefit passing is flat or goes down."
</P>
<P>
	   Tops on the list of "benefit passing" is Sen. Gerald Cardinale, who, along
with his wife, attended a conference in Puerto Rico courtesy of the New Jersey
Bankers Association, according to the report. That accounted for about $2,700 of
the $3,611 Cardinale received in benefits, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, R-Salem, was fourth on the list with benefits
worth $1,274. These included several golf outings and dinners courtesy of a wide
range of interests, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins said he paid "for a number of trips" and said he is "very
comfortable in how I do my job."
</P>
<P>
	   "My role as speaker is to meet with people and discuss various issues,"
Collins said. "If they are over lunch or a round of golf or whatever else, the
same kinds of discussions take place. Obviously, if I thought there was a
problem with it, I would not do it. It is part of the process. If there are
those who think that is negative, they have a right to that."
</P>
<P>
	   Senate President Donald DiFrancesco, who, like Collins, is eyeing a
gubernatorial run, is near the bottom of the list. The report shows he accepted
one trip worth $334, but then paid the lobbyist back for the expenses. The one
perk DiFrancesco accepted without paying back: a $45 trip to Yankee Stadium,
courtesy of Pfizer Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerry Flanagan, legislative coordinator for the New Jersey Public Interest
Research Group, said the latest report shows "big money continues to play a
major role in the legislative process."
</P>
<P>
	   "Unless we're able to curtail that role, democracy will be curtailed and New
Jersey citizens' issues will not be heard," Flanagan said. "Special interests
that can hire high-priced lobbying organizations allow them to have special
access to legislators. The issues and concerns of New Jersey citizens get a
second tier importance."
</P>
<P>
	   However, Hazel Gluck, partner of Gluckshaw, a lobbying firm ranked third in
New Jersey in terms of spending and receipts, said lobbyists are "fair game" for
what she says are unfair charges.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everyone seems to hate lobbyists and used car salesmen," said Gluck. "But
PIRG doesn't have any idea what happens. We have a lot of not-for-profits that
come in, and we charge them very little money. Sometimes we do it pro-bono. We
represent groups like the National Breast Cancer Coalition, food banks, real
people doing wonderful things. We do a lot of that work. I can't tell you the
number of times people call here and ask for help and we check things out for
them, point them in the right direction and never charge them a dime."
</P>
<P>
	   The reports showed the top-spending lobbying firm of 1999 was Public
Strategies Impact, at $1.6 million. The second highest was Princeton Public
Affairs Group, Inc., at $1.2 million, followed by Gluckshaw, at $716,875.

<HEADLINE> Study: Blacks on TV Are Segregated  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Black characters on TV are strong in number but tend to
be segregated in certain sitcoms and on fledgling networks UPN and WB, according
to a Screen Actors Guild study released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Conducted by University of Southern California sociology professor Darnell
M. Hunt, the study examined all comedy and drama series that aired on ABC, CBS,
NBC, Fox and the two newer networks during five weeks in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The report comes shortly after the NAACP and other civil rights groups
wrapped up agreements with the four major networks to commit to more ethnically
diverse programming and hiring. A nearly all-white slate of fall 1999 new series
prompted the groups to act.
</P>
<P>
	   Hunt said his findings were important because the way TV includes or
excludes groups of people reflects "unresolved questions about power imbalances
in our society."
</P>
<P>
	   In the SAG-commissioned study, Hunt found that blacks were numerically well
represented. Blacks make up 12.2 percent of the U.S. population but accounted
for nearly 16 percent of the characters seen on the six networks during the
period reviewed.
</P>
<P>
	   But about half of all black characters appeared in comedies, compared with
less than a third, 30 percent, of all white characters, the study found.
</P>
<P>
	   The black characters were concentrated on UPN and WB, which produced less
than a third of the episodes aired, 29.4 percent, but accounted for more than 44
percent of all black characters seen in prime time.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven predominantly black sitcoms airing Monday and Friday nights on UPN and
WB represent nearly two-thirds of all black prime time characters who appear for
a substantial amount of time, more than 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The study "seems to go right to the heart of what our effort has been all
about," said Frank L. Berry, Western region executive director of the NAACP.
Blacks "are being steered, for whatever reason, into comedies."
</P>
<P>
	   Berry said blacks need to branch out not only into dramatic acting roles,
but into writing and directing jobs to ensure their experience is accurately
portrayed.
</P>
<P>
	   While every show on UPN featured a black series regular, less than half of
WB's shows had blacks as regular characters. That suggests "the WB lineup is
largely segregated into 'black' and 'white' shows," according to the study.
</P>
<P>
	   The statistics reflect the tendency of newer networks to go after
underserved minority audiences to build viewership, a tactic Fox once used as a
young network.
</P>
<P>
	   But now blacks are underrepresented at Fox, the study found, and at NBC as
well: Less than 10 percent of the characters on Fox and about 11 percent of
those on NBC were black, and most were not central to story lines.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 15 percent of all characters in ABC series and 13 percent of CBS
characters were black.

<HEADLINE> Damaging Testimony in Gov.'s Case  </HEADLINE>
   By NATALIE GOTT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- A former casino consultant tearfully told a federal
jury Thursday that he funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars in payoffs to
former Gov. Edwin Edwards and his son Stephen -- before and after Edwards left
office in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricky Shetler's testimony, backed by Shetler's own ledgers and conversations
secretly recorded by the FBI, was the most damaging to date in Edwards'
seven-week-old federal racketeering trial -- and in the 40-year public life of
the scandal-plagued four-term governor.
</P>
<P>
	   By his own count, Edwards, 72, has been the subject of almost two dozen
state or federal investigations going back to his days as a congressman in the
'60s. In 1985, he was acquitted on federal racketeering charges involving health
care investments.
</P>
<P>
	   Known for his deadpan wit, Edwards has maintained a confident air throughout
this trial, despite a growing body of evidence against him. He has been
restrained from commenting on the evidence by the judge's gag order.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors say Edwin and Stephen Edwards and five other men took
part in a series of schemes to manipulate the licensing of riverboat casinos.
The ex-governor could face 350 years in prison and $7.2 million in fines if
convicted. Stephen could get 305 years.
</P>
<P>
	   As governor, Edwards appointed the now-defunct Louisiana Riverboat Gaming
Commission, which granted preliminary approval for riverboat licenses. And he
appointed the head of State Police, which issued the licenses.
</P>
<P>
	   Shetler, a lifelong friend of Stephen Edwards, turned on the Edwards family
in 1998, pleading guilty to extortion conspiracy charges and agreeing to
cooperate with federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   He fought back tears on the witness stand Thursday as federal prosecutor
Peter Strasser asked him how he felt about testifying against his friends.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Terrible,'' Shetler replied in a shaky voice while Stephen Edwards looked
on stoically. ``I feel terrible.''
</P>
<P>
	   Shetler said he gave the Edwardses cash, cars, furniture, appliances and
vacations in return for their help in getting state approval for two Players
riverboat casinos at Lake Charles and for hindering competition.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors reviewed ledgers with Shetler in which he had detailed his
payments to Stephen and Edwin Edwards. And they played tapes of conversations
secretly recorded in Edwin Edwards' law office in 1997 -- when Edwards allegedly
was continuing to accept payoffs for things he did before leaving office the
year before.
</P>
<P>
	   In one conversation, on Jan. 9, 1997, Stephen Edwards tells his father:
``I've got to get with Shetler because he still owes you the big check from
November and all of December. That should be six, seven, eight, nine thousand
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a Feb. 25 conversation in the same office, Edwards appears to be making
sure he does not have to deal directly with the money.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen Edwards: ``Shetler's been calling me. I think I should just stay in
and meet with him. He's coming in with your money.''
</P>
<P>
	   Edwin Edwards: ``I'd rather you do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors have portrayed Players executives as the victims of
extortion rather than participants in a bribery scheme, although some former
executives testified under grants of immunity.
</P>
<P>
	   The case brought pressure on Louisiana gambling regulators to revoke the
company's licenses for its two Lake Charles riverboats. The company eventually
agreed to pay the state $10.8 million and get out of Louisiana.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Ad War Escalates  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT LINDLAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO (AP) -- As the political ad war escalates in California, Gov.
George W. Bush is under fire from his rival, Sen. John McCain, and from the
Sierra Club. The Texas governor, meanwhile, is stepping up his own advertising
with two new spots, including one in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sierra Club ad lambastes Bush's environmental record, charging Texas
with leading the nation in the number of factories violating clean water
standards, and in carcinogens and toxins released. It says he has accepted more
than $1 million in campaign contributions from ``Texas' worst polluters.''
</P>
<P>
	   The ad airing in San Jose and Sacramento mirrors spots the Sierra Club ran
against Bush in New Hampshire and Michigan. The group raised similar questions
about McCain's commitment to the environment in his home state of Arizona, but
is silent on McCain in its California spot.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Paparian, a Sierra Club spokesman, declined to say who had the poorer
record. The organization, which has not endorsed a candidate in either major
party, went after Bush because he has more latitude to effect change as chief
executive, he said. McCain is a U.S. senator
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're trying to send a message that if he cares about national leadership,
he'd better take care of some environmental leadership back home,'' Paparian
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's campaign said that since 1995, Texas has reduced the release and
disposal of harmful toxic pollution by 43 million pounds, leading the nation.
And 97.7 percent of Texas wastewater discharge facilities meet state and federal
clean water standards, the campaign said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, launched an ad in Los Angeles comparing himself to
conservative icon Ronald Reagan. The ad comes as McCain and Bush seek to burnish
their conservative images.
</P>
<P>
	   It touts McCain's priorities, but also takes a dig at Bush's support from
the GOP officials, saying: ``You can't turn on your TV without seeing an ad from
the establishment trying to fool you about me.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush fired back with a press release, replying: ``Senator, you're no Ronald
Reagan.'' McCain is no more interested in tax cuts that President Clinton, the
campaign charged.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush was preparing two ads to begin Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Spanish-language ad shows him in a classroom and features images of
American flags. It touts Bush as ``positive'' and ``inclusive.'' ``George W.
Bush is a family man who shares our conservative values,'' an announcer says.
Looking into the camera, Bush says in Spanish: ``It's a new day.''
</P>
<P>
	   The second ad will promote his record on various issues, his campaign said.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore also is running ads in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
	   About 15 percent of the California electorate is Hispanic. While Bush has
attracted large numbers of them in Texas, California Republicans have fared
poorly with the group in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Kellogg Making Private Brand Cereal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- Kellogg Co. has agreed to supply cereal to a German discount
supermarket chain under the store's own brand name.
</P>
<P>
	   The Battle Creek-based cereal maker will supply Aldi Group with five
breakfast cereals under the Gletscher Krone brand, the company said late
Thursday, confirming a report on the Web site of London's Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement with Aldi is part of a strategy of cutting costs and using
production capacity across Europe, according to a written statement from
Kellogg.
</P>
<P>
	   The cereal maker said it previously has manufactured under private labels on
a very limited basis in other markets and under very specific market conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not a major U-turn by the company," said Alan Harris, president of
Kellogg Europe. "It's very much a test. It's limited to Aldi, it's limited to
Germany, and of our total sales in Europe, it will probably account for about 2
percent this year."
</P>
<P>
	   Harris said the Aldi products -- to be called Schoko Chips, Schoko Flakes,
Honey Nut Flakes, Honey Balls and White Flakes -- would be made with a different
recipe from Kellogg's branded products.
</P>
<P>
	   Once the biggest U.S. cereal maker, Kellogg has fallen behind
Minnesota-based General Mills for the first time in decades. Kellogg's market
share of cereal sales for the year ending Jan. 2 was 30.7 percent, compared with
32.2 percent for General Mills, according to Chicago-based Information Resources
Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   The Financial Times reported Kellogg agreed to the deal after Aldi
threatened to give the private-brand business to a German supplier.
</P>
<P>
	   Kellogg spokeswoman Chris Ervin told The Associated Press she had not heard
of any such threat.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was at the request of Aldi as a valued customer of Kellogg," she said
Thursday. "This is for them exclusively."
</P>
<P>
	   Private-brand products accounted for 18.6 percent of cereal sales in Germany
in 1998, up 1.9 percentage points from the year before, according to A.C.
Nielsen, a market research company.
</P>
<P>
	   Kellogg had 1999 earnings of $338.3 million on sales of $6.98 billion.

<HEADLINE> Lopez's Dress Leaves Fans Marveling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It was the most eye-popping part of the Grammys and a
day later fans were still pondering the tale of the tape. Just how did singer
Jennifer Lopez hold it all together in her revealing Versace dress?
</P>
<P>
	   Lopez's people say such details are too intimate to share, but fashion
watchers say it's tape that keeps plunging necklines like her's from opening too
wide. A deep "V" opened to Lopez's navel, where a large broach held the blue and
green print fabric in place.
</P>
<P>
	   "My guess is that it was double-faced cellophane tape," said Tom Julian, a
trend analyst with Fallon McElligott in New York. "It could have been very small
and very subtle. It definitely has to be invisible."
</P>
<P>
	   Versace officials did not immediately answer requests for details on how
such sheer, long-sleeved dresses stay put.
</P>
<P>
	   But one fashion magazine editor who traveled from New York to watch
Wednesday's awards ceremony speculated that the tape may have been sewn in to
the "V" with velcro.

<HEADLINE> NY Senate Race Turns Negative Early  </HEADLINE>
   By MARC HUMBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- One of her friends says he looks like a Pez candy
dispenser. He tells potential donors she is guilty of ``hostility toward
America's religious traditions.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate race between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
has turned negative early, much earlier than usual even for normally nasty New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Minus the TV ads, it's like October already,'' pollster Lee Miringoff,
head of Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion, said. ``They're already
doing the hypocrite-liar routine.''
</P>
<P>
	   Already, there are some ads. This month, the New York City mayor began
airing a radio spot attacking the first lady's husband for refusing to tap the
nation's strategic oil reserves to help push down rapidly rising home heating
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mr. President, why don't you feel our pain?'' the mayor asked in what
Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson called ``the first negative ad of the
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   That's tame compared with some of the exchanges.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady has accused the mayor of running a campaign based on insults,
being angry all the time and ill-suited to the collegial Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   At a dinner Sunday night in Albany she advised more than 1,000 blacks and
Hispanics that they should ask the candidates ``will you work to unite people or
will you try to bring more conflict by insulting and demeaning people? ... I
reject the politics of division, revenge and retribution.''
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor has been quick to jump on apparent, but seemingly minor campaign
gaffes by the first lady, including her failure to leave a tip for a waitress at
a restaurant in rural Albion just west of Rochester. She was taken to task for
the playing of Billy Joel's ``Captain Jack,'' a song that deals with drug use,
as part of the warmup music at her formal campaign announcement. Her aides said
they hadn't selected the music.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Democratic Committee has begun putting out a ``City Hall Scandal
Sheet'' that catalogues anything negative written about the mayor. The
Republican National Committee uses its fax machines to bash the first lady at
every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor has a Web site whose address is ``HillaryNo.com'' and regularly
jokes about the ``vast right-wing conspiracy'' that she once blamed for the
Monica Lewinsky sex scandal that led to the president's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
	   For the record, both deny running negative campaigns. It's the other guy,
they say.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not going to let the Clintons blow into town, set up shop here and
conduct the same kind of very nasty personal campaigns they've done in the
past,'' Giuliani campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Noting that Clinton campaign adviser James Carville had called Giuliani's
team ``goons'' and ``thugs,'' Teitelbaum said, ``We're not suckers and we won't
be played for suckers ... This is New York. This is a different kind of campaign
and we're not going to be a punching bag.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``There seems to be a charge a day coming from the other side and of course
you have to respond to that,'' Clinton said Tuesday during a Buffalo-area stop.
``But I think New Yorkers want this election to be about their future and that's
what I'm going to try to keep it focused on.''
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls have shown Giuliani with a slight lead over Clinton and few
undecided voters. That, says GOP political consultant Jay Severin, explains the
negative tactics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a race in which both candidates are fairly well known, so there
aren't a lot of ways to get people to love or like you more,'' said Severin, who
is not involved in the Senate race.

<HEADLINE> Group: Anti-Cuba Activists Held  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- At least nine anti-government activists were being held as
Cuba prepares to try a government opponent, a human rights leader said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The detentions in the last 72 hours ... (are) for the trial,'' said
Elizardo Sanchez, president of the independent Cuban Commission of Human Rights
and National Reconciliation. ``The charges are not known and it is probable that
all will be freed tomorrow,'' Sanchez told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Such temporary detentions commonly used by Cuban law enforcement to prevent
public protests by government opponents.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanchez said the eight men and one woman were picked up in the cities of
Havana, Manzanilo and Jiraba. He said he had no other details.
</P>
<P>
	   The detentions come on the eve of the Friday morning trial of Oscar Elias
Biscet, an anti-abortion physician who last year headed a 40-day protest in
Havana to demand the release of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba says it holds no true prisoners of conscience, only common criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   Biscet faces up to seven years in prison for insulting patriotic symbols,
public disorder and instigating delinquency.
</P>
<P>
	   Biscet was arrested Nov. 3 arrest after he allegedly hung the Cuban flag
upside down during a protest as a sign of civil disobedience. It apparently was
that act that most enraged Cuban authorities, for whom the national flag and
other patriotic symbols are sacred.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Principal Arrested for Forgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH ANDOVER, Mass. (AP) -- A former elementary school principal already
facing federal heroin possession charges was arrested again Thursday, this time
for allegedly forging a prescription.
</P>
<P>
	   Margaret Loder-Healy, who recently admitted on ABC's ''20/20'' to being a
heroin addict for years, was nabbed by a plainclothes policeman after leaving a
pharmacy counter, where she picked up two prescriptions. Police said she called
the pharmacy Wednesday, pretending to be a nurse from a doctor's office who was
requesting painkillers and an antibiotic.
</P>
<P>
	   She was arrested on charges of a forged prescription and shoplifting.
Authorities said she swiped a packet of candy-coated almonds on her way to the
pharmacy counter.
</P>
<P>
	   She pleaded innocent to the charges Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Loder-Healy, 46, was first charged after police broke up a heroin ring in
October. At the time, she was principal of Memorial Elementary School in Newton,
N.H., where she had earned distinction for helping the small-town school become
the state's best. She resigned in November.
</P>
<P>
	   After initially pleading innocent, she recently struck a deal with federal
prosecutors to plead guilty to heroin-related charges. She faces up to a year in
jail and $100,000 in fines on those charges.

<HEADLINE> Senegal Heads Off Election Violence  </HEADLINE>
   By GLENN McKENZIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- Police and soldiers patrolled sleepy suburbs and
bustling markets Thursday amid scattered political violence just days before
Senegal's most contentious presidential elections in decades.
</P>
<P>
	   At least six people were seriously injured and two homes stoned and torched
Wednesday evening in fighting between opposition and ruling party activists in
Rufisque, about 15 miles east of the capital, Dakar, political officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is all a grave sign for democracy in Senegal,'' said Rufisque Mayor
Mbaye Jacques Diop, a senior ruling party member who owns the two destroyed
homes.
</P>
<P>
	   The fighting spread Thursday to the town of Thies, about 40 miles to the
east. Two more homes, owned by a ruling party official and a political rival,
were burned, the independent radio station Sud FM reported. It was not
immediately clear if there were casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   Relatives and supporters were sweeping up the charred remains of furniture
Thursday, as armored vehicles full of troops guarded the premises.
</P>
<P>
	   Some observers predicted Sunday's vote to be the most difficult in years for
President Abdou Diouf, whose Socialist Party has ruled this West African nation
since independence from France in 1960.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition leader Abdoulaye Wade and six other candidates are bidding to
oust Diouf. If there is no clear winner on Sunday, the top candidates will
square off in a second round.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to Diouf, a 62-year-old career politician who first became president
in 1981, confidently predicted an easy first round win.
</P>
<P>
	   Senegal has long been one of Africa's most developed and stable nations,
whose business leaders are often European-educated and renowned for their global
trading savvy.

<HEADLINE> Violence Mars Johns Hopkins Protest  </HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN MANNING Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) -- A demonstration by Johns Hopkins University students and
local labor leaders erupted into violence Thursday as some protesters tried to
force their way into the university's administration building.
</P>
<P>
	   The rally was held to underscore demands that the school extend its ``living
wage'' policy to independent contractors.
</P>
<P>
	   About seven protesters wrestled with security guards for about five minutes
as they tried to enter the building through a side door. One guard was bloodied
and at least one student received a black eye.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters failed to gain access to the building. University spokesman
Dennis O'Shea said he did not expect any arrests to be made.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 250 students, union members and local clergy took part in the
protest on the Homewood Campus in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the Student Labor Action Committee want the university to require
vendors that provide services for the school to pay workers the $7.75 hourly
wage that university employees and contract workers are paid.
</P>
<P>
	   Specifically, SLAC and members of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and
Textile Employees targeted Up-to-Date Laundry Inc., which launders hospital
sheets and other textiles for the Johns Hopkins Health System. Up-to-Date hires
new workers at $5.50 an hour, said the company's plant operations manager, Mike
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hopkins is their biggest client. We think that if Hopkins takes the
initiative to say this behavior is unacceptable, other hospitals may follow
suit,'' said Ben Hensler, a union organizer.

Betty Lou Beets Executed in Texas
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Texas Governor George W. Bush rejected her
last-ditch appeal and Betty Lou Beets was executed tonight for killing her fifth
husband nearly 17 years ago. Beets, 62, had no last remarks before the lethal
injection. Death penalty opponents and domestic violence organizations had urged
Bush to grant Beets a 30-day delay, arguing it would be consistent with his
description of himself as a "compassionate conservative" in his GOP presidential
bid. Beets and her lawyers insisted the former bartender-waitress was the victim
of years of domestic abuse and should be allowed to live.

independent voter is suing for the right to vote in New York's closed Republican
presidential primary March 7. Currently, only voters registered with the party
may vote in its primary. Wendy Van Wie, 46, had been independent but registered
as a Republican after a federal judge ordered that McCain be placed on the
ballot statewide. But she was told that state law would keep her from voting in
a New York presidential primary until 2004. Voters who switch or join parties
after being uncommitted must wait until after a presidential election to

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is allowing Maine to provide
Medicaid payments to people who are HIV-positive, but do not yet have AIDS, as
part of an experiment that could expand federal health benefits for HIV and AIDS
victims. Previously, patients could not qualify until they had full-blown AIDS.
Health Secretary Donna Shalala said today that Maine would be the first state to
offer such a plan. The state's five-year demonstration project begins in
September. To be eligible, a participant must be HIV-positive and have an income
of less than about $25,000, which is three times the federal poverty level.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Couples who light candles for a romantic dinner -- or

small children, said a study released today by a consumer advocacy group. Of 285
candles bought in the Washington area, the cotton wicks in 86 of them were
stiffened with metal and nine of those used high amounts of lead, the Public
Citizen study said. The cotton wick of a candle is woven around a narrow
stiffener, which may be metal or paper. When the candle burns, the metal melts
and releases a residue into the air. U.S. candle makers agreed in 1974 to stop
using lead.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Revive Economic Theme  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Waxing nostalgic about eight years' worth of his fiscal
policies, President Clinton on Thursday courted support for his plan to keep the
economy rolling along on the strength of the Internet and expansion into new
markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton went to the University of Pennsylvania to lay out his vision for the
economy before about 800 students, faculty and business leaders. He said he will
gather economists, CEOs and other experts at the White House on April 5 to
explore ``the big cutting-edge economic issues still before us.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to ask them to identify ways we can build on America's strengths
and deal with our continuing weaknesses,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president listed many factors for the nation's climb out of recession
during his time in office, such as low interest rates, falling unemployment,
increased private sector investments and consecutive years of balanced budgets.
But, he said, scientific and technological developments have been the biggest
factor behind economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It clearly would not have gone on as long as it has, and the way it has,
without the information technology revolution,'' Clinton said. ``So the next
question is, can we keep it going? And, if so, how? And can we spread the
benefits to people and places that have been left behind?''
</P>
<P>
	   As Clinton spoke, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled below 10,000. The
Dow finished down 133.41 at 10,092.63 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Clinton struck the economic-growth theme at a pair of fund-raisers in
New York that raised about $1.1 million for the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   At the first dinner, Clinton offered some credit for the good economic times
to his two Republican predecessors, who he said were responsible for open
markets and expanding trade. He also credited Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan with having the vision to not reflexively raise interest rates in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If Alan Greenspan had followed all the textbook economic models, it could
have killed this recovery,'' Clinton said. ``He was willing to look at the
evidence, not the theory, and not get in your way.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president also held out hope that the Republican majority in Congress
would not again pursue large tax cuts. ``We may be about to get back to a
bipartisan fiscal policy,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Philadelphia, Clinton returned to the setting where he discussed his
economic ideas as a candidate in 1992, a time he said was marked by deficits,
stubborn rates of unemployment and otherwise lackluster economic measures, even
though the nation was actually coming out of a recession that year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had some pretty basic ideas that all boiled down to my conviction that
there was nothing wrong with America that couldn't be fixed by what's right with
this country,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said taking advantage of investments in science and technology was one of
his highest priorities at that time, and the country has accomplished that
through explosive growth of the Internet, ``an economic transformation as
profound as that of the Industrial Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
	   Otherwise, he pinned the nation's progress on the ``responsible fiscal
policies'' of his tenure. But he also credited the ``good monetary policy'' of
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who he said has resisted knee-jerk
interest rate increases to stave off inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mr. Greenspan was able to look at the evidence of the new economy over the
traditional ideology,'' Clinton said. ``He was resisting that because he knew
something was going on, even though no economist could give him a model which
proved it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton made a pitch for open trade, arguing for allowing China entry into
the World Trade Organization and broadening U.S. presence in markets in Africa,
the Caribbean and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   He also advocated expanding into forgotten markets on U.S. soil, areas where
unemployment has remained persistently high, such as inner cities and Indian
reservations in Western states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In order to keep this economy growing, we have to find more and more new
customers,'' he said. ``If you can create new businesses, new business owners,
and new employees, who are also consumers, within our borders, that will grow
the economy without inflation. It will also fulfill our moral responsibility to
give everybody a shot at the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was spending the night at his family home in Chappaqua, N.Y., and
returning to the White House on Friday.

<P>
	   First Data, which provides credit cards and transaction processing to banks

</P>
<P>
	   The cuts came after First Data executives decided the company had

</P>
<P>
	   "This action basically right-sizes our company," she said. "Our business is
very competitive, and we need to look for more and better ways to be more
efficient so we can continue to grow and reduce operating costs."

<HEADLINE> Texas Executes Convicted Killer  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL GRACZYK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A 62-year-old woman was executed by injection
Thursday after Gov. George W. Bush rejected her claim that she killed her fifth
husband in self-defense and deserved a reprieve.
</P>
<P>
	   Betty Lou Beets became the fourth woman to be executed in the United States
since the Supreme Court in 1976 allowed the death penalty to resume. She was the
second woman executed in Texas since the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
	   She gave no final statement as she lay strapped to the death chamber gurney.
She made no eye contact with the victim's family, but smiled at her attorney and
a spiritual adviser watching through a window at her side. She continued smiling
as she slipped into unconsciousness.
</P>
<P>
	   Death penalty opponents and domestic violence organizations had urged Bush
to grant Beets a 30-day delay, arguing it would be consistent with his
description of himself as a ``compassionate conservative'' in his presidential
campaign. The delay was Bush's only option, since the state parole board did not
recommend that her sentence be commuted to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   During his 5 1/2 years as governor, 120 convicted killers have been executed
in Texas, and Bush has said he is certain all of them were guilty. He spared one
condemned inmate whose guilt, he said, was in doubt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After careful review of the evidence of the case, I concur with the jury
that Betty Lou Beets is guilty of this murder,'' Bush said in a written
statement after returning to Texas from California, where he was campaigning for
the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm confident that the courts, both state and federal, have thoroughly
reviewed all the issues raised by the defendant.''
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said Beets shot and killed two of her husbands, but she was only
tried in the death of her fifth husband, Dallas Fire Captain Jimmy Don Beets,
nearly 17 years ago. Prosecutors said she killed him to collect his life
insurance and pension.
</P>
<P>
	   Beets and her lawyers insisted the former bartender-waitress was the victim
of years of domestic abuse and should be allowed to live.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans rejected an
appeal that accused the state of not following its own rules in reviewing Beets'
case. The arguments were dismissed Wednesday by a federal judge in Austin as a
delay tactic.
</P>
<P>
	   Beets' lawyers also took the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court, which
rejected it without comment.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the governor's office, Bush had received 2,108 phone calls and
letters opposing Beets' execution by Thursday afternoon, and 57 favoring it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A decision to stay the execution of Ms. Beets would demonstrate your
compassionate conservatism and that you are willing to do what is right even in
the face of potential criticism from your constituents,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson
wrote Bush on Thursday.
</P>
<P>

Death Penalty, implored Bush to grant a reprieve ``so evidence of her being
battered ... may be fully evaluated.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Far from receiving careful consideration, the role of domestic abuse in
Betty's crime has been continually swept under the rug by the Texas court
system,'' Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Beets, the last woman executed in Texas was Karla Faye Tucker, on
Feb. 3, 1998. Tucker hacked two people to death with a pickax but said she had a
religious conversion in prison and appealed for mercy. Bush was criticized for
mocking Tucker in a magazine interview last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Beets was the ninth convicted killer and the second in as many days to be
executed in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state.
</P>
<P>
	   Her claims of domestic abuse surfaced only recently and were not a factor in
her 1985 trial, although one of her daughters, Faye Lane, in a tearful plea for
her mother's life, said this week her mother was acting in self-defense after
years of abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   James Beets, the murder victim's son, discounted claims of abuse, saying she
told friends her husband of 11 months had been the best thing to happen to her.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My dad was a Dallas fireman for 26 years,'' he said after witnessing the
execution. ``He lived to help people, not hurt people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Betty Lou Beets also was convicted of shooting and wounding her second
husband, Bill Lane.
</P>
<P>
	   Acting on a tip two years after Jimmy Don Beets was reported missing from a
fishing trip, authorities found his body buried under a wishing well flower
garden in the yard of their trailer home. They also discovered nearby in another
shallow grave the body of husband No. 4, Doyle Barker, who had been missing for
four years.
</P>
<P>
	   Both had been shot in the back of the head and stuffed into blue sleeping
bags.
</P>
<P>
	   Beets blamed a son for Jimmy Don Beets' death. The son denied any
involvement and testified against her. Beets explained Barker's disappearance by
saying he left one day and never returned.
</P>
<P>
	   She blamed husband No. 2, Lane, for Barker's death. Although she was charged
in his death, she was never tried.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I felt the 14 years she was down here done me no justice until today,''
Barker's son, Rodney, said after watching the execution. ``And I felt like the
state of Texas had done something for me finally as a victim. I want people to
know victims have rights too. We're tired of hearing about Betty Beets.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Finance Reformer Under Fire  </HEADLINE>
    By KOZO MIZOGUCHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- The chief of Japan's financial reform program said Friday he
would not resign despite mounting criticism over his remarks suggesting that
bank inspections would be lenient.
</P>
<P>
	   Michio Ochi, the head of the Financial Reconstruction Commission, told
reporters waiting outside his Tokyo home Friday morning that he was sorry for
causing a stir.
</P>
<P>
	   "But I have no intention to resign," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The furor began Saturday when Ochi told a crowd of officials from credit
unions and other financial institutions in a town north of Tokyo that he would
give them "utmost consideration" during inspections of their businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The remarks were interpreted to mean that such inspections would be lenient.
</P>
<P>
	   The comments are controversial in Japan because the government has pumped
massive amounts of public money into the banks to help them bounce back from a
bad loan crisis. The crisis has been blamed on bad management and poor oversight
by government regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   The Financial Reconstruction Commission is the government body overseeing
efforts to clean up the industry, and inspections of the institutions are to be
conducted from March to July.
</P>
<P>
	   The opposition has jumped on Ochi's comments, calling for his resignation
and using the scandal to pummel Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Three opposition parties stormed out of a Budget Committee meeting in the
lower house of Parliament on Friday morning in protest.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's time for you to resign," Democrat Kazuhiro Haraguchi railed at Ochi,
accusing him of pandering to the banking industry. Opposition members then
walked out of the conference room.
</P>
<P>
	   Obuchi's government acknowledged Ochi's comments were troublesome.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is undoubtedly true that (his remarks) have caused misunderstanding
among the Japanese people, and that is regrettable," said Chief Cabinet
Secretary Mikio Aoki, who met with Ochi on Friday morning.

<HEADLINE> Operation Launched To Aid Ethiopians  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. World Food Program is launching a $137
million operation Friday to feed more than 2.3 million people drought victims in
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is the hope that by acting now we can prevent a human catastrophe from
developing in the near future,'' U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   A recent food and crop assessment by the Rome-based World Food Program and
the Food and Agriculture Organization indicated that millions of Ethiopians are
in need of food aid.
</P>
<P>
	   For two decades, there has been a shortage of food in Ethiopia, caused
largely by unfavorable weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year's rains were late, and when they finally came, they were unusually
heavy and stormy. As a result, many farms were waterlogged and long-cycle crops,
like corn and sorghum, were destroyed, the WFP and FAO said.

<HEADLINE> McCain Bids for GOP Votes in Calif.  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Calling himself ``a proud Reagan Republican,''
John McCain touted his endorsement by San Diego's GOP mayor Thursday and
underlined conservative credentials in a new ad airing in primary states from
California to New York.
</P>
<P>
	   After winning in New Hampshire and Michigan with an appeal to Democrats and
independents as well as Republicans, McCain is seeking to gain on rival George
W. Bush among registered Republicans here. Republicans alone will determine
which candidate is awarded all 162 of the state's GOP presidential delegates in
the March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a big spender and not a fiscal conservative,'' McCain said of Bush
during a visit to California State University at Sacramento. To support the
charge in the heart of Reagan country, McCain said the Texas governor raised his
state's spending by 35 percent during his tenure, compared with President
Clinton's federal spending increase of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``George Bush is a lot of things. But a conservative he's not,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has linked the increase in part to his state's booming population and
contends that McCain's own voting record -- including his support of a tobacco
tax bill in 1998 -- reveals that the Arizona senator compromises too easily on
conservative goals.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor also accuses McCain of hypocrisy for dismissing the
Republican establishment even as he publicizes new endorsements from GOP
leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain often says one thing and does another,'' said Bush
spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush was taking a rare day off from the campaign Thursday at home in Austin.
He had a full schedule Friday in Virginia, where Republicans will hold their
primary next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   As in many states, Virginia's governor and most top GOP officials are Bush
supporters. Attorney General Mark L. Earley said he would endorse Bush on Friday
in Newport News.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's new ad, titled ``Reagan Conservative,'' takes aim at Bush and that
army of elected supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can't turn on your TV without seeing an ad from the establishment
trying to fool you about me,'' McCain says. ``I'm a proud Reagan Republican. ...
Give me your vote and we'll give you back your government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Bob Dole, the party's unsuccessful 1996 candidate, made a plea
for a ``time-out'' on intraparty accusations ``before matters get out of
control'' and give the Democrats a big advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole hasn't endorsed either candidate, but he has been close to McCain, who
sometimes traveled with him on his campaign plane in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   After a town hall meeting, McCain appeared here with two establishment
figures at his side, San Diego Mayor Susan Golding and California Secretary of
State Bill Jones.
</P>
<P>
	   Golding called McCain ``the Republicans' best bet to win back the White
House,'' and she said, ``He will bring faith in our country and pride in the
White House back to America.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I respect him more than I can say. And he respects me. And I think that's
something that the women who are voting in the Republican Party need to
understand,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike Jones, Golding had not previously endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Touting his conservatism is only part of McCain's strategy for the March 7
``Super Tuesday'' primaries. In California, he will augment that message with
appeals for the votes of senior citizens by talking up his plan to use the
federal budget surplus to pay down Social Security rather than for a massive tax
cut, according to senior adviser Ken Khachigian.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator also was making points aimed at independents and
Democrats, part of his national strategy to make the case that he appeals to a
broader range of voters and could win a general election.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Don't you think that Republicans in California would like to win a
campaign for a change?'' McCain asked the crowd, which responded with the
loudest applause of his speech here. ``In order to do that, my friends, we have
to practice the politics of addition.''	   He took more shots at Bush for
speaking at Bob Jones University without denouncing the school's ban on
interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's out-and-out racism,'' McCain said. ``Governor Bush went there and
never said a word. I would never ever do such a thing.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain tripped over one issue when a questioner asked whether he would
support California's Proposition 22, which states that California would not
recognize same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would not vote for it,'' McCain said at first, contradicting his own
opposition to same-sex marriage. Later, he told reporters he had misunderstood
the question and would support the initiative, especially since he voted that
way in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I understood the question to be as to whether I would vote to legalize gay
marriage. I would not and I would vote for Prop 22,'' McCain said. ``I'm not
familiar with as many of the propositions here in California as perhaps I should
be. ... I will be well versed in all of those propositions as we go through the
campaign.''

	   BRIDGEWATER, Mass. (AP) -- Edward R. Querzoli, a former managing editor of
The Patriot Ledger, died Monday after a lengthy illness. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
	   Querzoli began his journalism career as a reporter for the Taunton Daily

</P>
<P>
	   He was named managing editor in 1974 and held that position until 1985, when
he stepped down because of a heart ailment. He then became the Ledger's first
ombudsman, answering complaints from readers and improving their access to the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   He is survived by his wife of 45 years, Miriam; five sons; eight daughters;
a sister; and 24 grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Mafia Hitman Gravano Arrested  </HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK GRAHAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Former Mafia hitman Salvatore ``Sammy the Bull'' Gravano, a
turncoat whose testimony helped put crime boss John Gotti behind bars, was
arrested Thursday for involvement with a drug ring, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gravano, 54, was not selling narcotics but helped finance the drug ring and
was a ``mentor'' to the ring's leader, Michael Papa, the founding member of a
white supremacist gang, said Phoenix police spokesman Jeff Halstead.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-six members of the ring, which allegedly sold the drug ecstasy, were
arrested including Papa, Gravano's wife, Debra; son Gerard; daughter Karen; and
son-in-law David Seabrook.
</P>
<P>
	   A judge set Gravano's bail at $5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no violence in this case that I'm charged with ... this is a
minor thing,'' Gravano said in court Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Gravano, a hitman who admitted killing 19 people, ravaged the Mafia by
defecting to the government and helping to convict Gotti and dozens of other
gangland cronies. Authorities called him the most important mob turncoat in U.S.
history.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His primary testimony against the mob doesn't give him a free ride to
facilitate drug dealing in Arizona,'' state Attorney General Janet Napolitano
said.
</P>
<P>
	   His bombshell testimony, along with conversations secretly taped by the FBI,
finally put Gotti, the so-called ``Teflon Don,'' behind bars for life in 1992
after three previous acquittals.
</P>
<P>
	   Under his deal with prosecutors, Gravano served only five years for
racketeering.
</P>
<P>
	   He then entered the federal witness protection program, but dropped out in
1997 saying he wanted to live normally, not always looking over his shoulder for
``some kid'' hoping to ``make a name for himself by taking me out.''
</P>
<P>
	   By 1999, he was making a new life in a Phoenix suburb, living under an
assumed name but telling a reporter for The Arizona Republic he didn't think he
was in any real danger.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not running from the (expletive) Mafia,'' Gravano told the Republic
last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Gravano was arrested at an apartment, and his wife, daughter and son-in-law
were arrested at their 4,400-square-foot house, complete with swimming pool and
three-car garage. Law enforcement agents were seen taking a pair of Lexuses and
a boat from the 1 1/2-acre lot Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents in the upscale neighborhood sometimes whispered about the people
who lived in the stucco house on the corner -- they had heard the rumors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We just decided to not spread the word who lived there. We felt that they
had a right to live their life,'' said Kay Gianopulos, 71, who lives down the
street.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the drug operation sold up to 30,000 ecstasy pills a week in
Phoenix and may have had links to other states. On its Web site Thursday, the
Republic reported the ring targeted teen-agers and rave music clubs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was waiting for this,'' Bruce Cutler, an attorney for Gotti, said after
Gravano's arrest. ``You can't change the nature of a man ... He is a reprobate,
a craven liar.''
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Ron Kuby, who represents the families of Gravano's 19 murder
victims in a civil suit, said Gravano's insistence that he was repudiating his
criminal ways had been a scam.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wonder how the government officials who cozied up to this mobster must
feel,'' Kuby said. ``First they allow him to get away with 19 murders, then they
turn him loose to deal poison to the unsuspecting people of Arizona.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Higher at Midday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks moved slightly higher Friday morning, largely
unaffected by a decline on Wall Street. The dollar slipped against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 14.15 points or 0.07
percent, to 19,585.59 at the end of the morning session. On Thursday, the
average closed up 51.89 points, or 0.27 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 110.74 yen, down 0.32 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and
also below its late New York level of 111.06 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei fluctuated in a narrow range between
negative and positive territory amid caution about the direction of U.S. stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   But buying of some high technology issues and major department store stocks
pushed the index into positive territory before the end of the morning session.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders said the market's downside was supported by hopes for buying from
newly established investment trust funds and the record close in the
technology-rich Nasdaq composite index in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 133.10 points to
10,092.63 amid worries about rising interest rates. At one point it briefly fell
below 10,000 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq, however, finished up 67.32 points at 4,617.65, reaching a new
closing high for the second day in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 26.71 points, or 1.58 percent, to 1,716.76. The TOPIX closed up
22.81 points, or 1.37 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, traders said the dollar moved lower Friday morning as
some investors covered short, or oversold yen positions. They said there was no
major market-moving news.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 110.92 yen, up from 110.84 yen
late Thursday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.8850
percent from Thursday's finish of 1.8700 percent. Its price fell 0.13 point to
99.28.

<HEADLINE> Some Optimism in Boeing Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SEATAC, Wash. (AP) -- Contract talks resumed Thursday between The Boeing Co.
and its striking engineers and technical workers, but a chasm remained between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
	   At the request of federal mediators, bargaining teams met Thursday morning
-- 16 days after the walkout began Feb. 9 -- at the Doubletree Hotel here. Talks
continued into the evening and were expected to continue through the weekend if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have spent the majority of the day looking for alternatives," Richard
C. Barnes, the nation's top federal mediator, told KIRO-TV. "We have not had a
breakthrough, we have not had any agreement on any of the issues, but they're
working very hard to come up with something."
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides declined to give details of the talks, in accordance with rules
set by Barnes, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   The union -- the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace
-- is seeking guaranteed bonuses for all the 22,600 workers covered by SPEEA
contracts. Boeing, however, has only promised bonuses based on merit. The two
sides are also at odds on salaries and benefits packages.
</P>
<P>
	   "The most important thing is the process is continuing," Boeing spokesman
Peter Conte said, adding both sides spent much of the day meeting independently,
though negotiators met for a brief, 30-minute joint session.
</P>
<P>
	   An earlier two-day session of talks had been unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing has delivered only four airplanes so far this month. In February
1999, the company delivered 47 aircraft to customers.

<HEADLINE> McCain, Bradley banking on Washington state  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SEATTLE (AP) - Sen. John McCain and Bill Bradley are looking for a
campaign bounce from independent-minded voters in Washington state, known more
as the home of Microsoft, Starbucks and grunge rock than for any tradition of
being a political player.
<P>
	   McCain spent Wednesday in the state, fresh from his big wins in Republican
presidential primaries in Michigan and Arizona. Bradley, a Democrat, arrived
later for a six-day stay.
</P>
<P>
	   Both presidential candidates say they hope to get some traction with their
maverick, reformist messages, which they believe the voters of Washington state
will embrace next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaigns also are looking for a slingshot effect that will influence
balloting in California, New York and other states holding primaries and
caucuses a week later on March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the first time Washington has had a chance to send a message to the
country. It's an important moment in Washington history, and we think we can do
well here," Bradley said Thursday after a campaign stop in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain and Bradley aren't the only ones with their sights set on the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrat Al Gore, a frequent visitor to Washington, is due on Saturday, and
Republican Gov. George W. Bush is confirmed for Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Democrats, Tuesday's primary is no more than a popularity contest,
since none of the 75 delegates to the national convention will be selected until
caucuses the following week. And Republicans are picking only 12 of their 37
delegates through the primary.
</P>
<P>
	   So why all the attention?
</P>
<P>
	   The calendar and the maverick character of Washington's electorate.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Bradley and McCain - who campaigned Wednesday in Spokane, Seattle and
aboard a chartered boat that plied the waters of Puget Sound - have said the
state's quirky political impulses and tradition of picking insurgents could be
of great benefit to their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   And Bradley, who is still searching for his first primary victory, said his
campaign has nothing to lose.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're so far behind. The expectation is we're not going to be able to do
anything," he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're looking for a slingshot effect. If we win this primary or have a
very, very strong showing, the Washington caucus-goers will be reluctant to
reject the will of the people," said Mo Elleithee, a Bradley spokesman. "It will
be a signal to California and the rest of the country that he is viable and this
thing is not wrapped up."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley plans to stress abortion rights, the environment, campaign finance
reform and education - all popular causes in this Democratic-leaning state.
</P>
<P>
	   But state Democratic Chairman Paul Berendt, who supports Gore for the
party's presidential nomination, said Bradley's focus smacks of desperation.
Most of the state's Democratic establishment, including popular Gov. Gary Locke,
are in the vice president's corner.
</P>
<P>
	   "He has to win someplace or his campaign will die," said Berendt, who urged
Bradley in a letter to abandon "your negative personal attacks" against Gore.
"It is high risk what he's doing, but what choice does he have?"
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, though, points to Washington primary victories by insurgents like
Gary Hart, Paul Tsongas and Jerry Brown over establishment favorites in previous
years. The Rev. Jesse Jackson also did well here, as did Reform Party founder
Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's state spokesman, Brian Jones, said, "It is very important for us to
win the primary and we're confident we will be able to do that."
</P>
<P>
	   State GOP Chairman Dale Foreman sees Bush as the likely winner of the
caucuses, given his superior organization. But the primary seems up for grabs,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It ain't over here," Foreman said. "McCain comes here with a big bounce. He
recognizes he has to do well in this state, and he should do well."
</P>
<P>
	   Stuart Elway, an independent pollster, said Bradley and McCain seem to be
courting the same unaffiliated voters, but that McCain seems to be winning that
battle.
</P>
<P>
	   His latest poll - following the trend in the Republican race - showed McCain
leading among independents, but trailing Bush among self-identified Republicans.
Gore had a strong lead over Bradley among Democrats, but was running
neck-and-neck among independents.

Betty Lou Beets Executed in Texas
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Betty Lous Beets, the Texas woman convicted of
killing her fifth husband, was executed today by lethal injection after her
11th-hour request for reprieve was rejected. She gave no final statement as she
lay strapped to the death chamber gurney. She made no eye contact with the
victim's family, but smiled at her attorney and a spiritual adviser watching
through a window at her side. She continued smiling as she slipped into
unconsciousness. Beets and her lawyers insisted the former bartender-waitress
was the victim of years of domestic abuse and should be allowed to live.

McCain Bids for GOP Votes in Calif.

<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Calling himself "a proud Reagan Republican," John
McCain touted his endorsement by San Diego's GOP mayor today and underlined
conservative credentials in a new ad airing in primary states from California to
New York. After winning in New Hampshire and Michigan with an appeal to
Democrats and independents as well as Republicans, McCain is seeking to gain on
rival George W. Bush among registered Republicans here. Republicans alone will
determine which candidate is awarded all 162 of the state's GOP presidential
delegates in the March 7 primary.

Violence Mars Johns Hopkins Protest
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) -- A demonstration by Johns Hopkins University students and
local labor leaders erupted into violence today as some protesters tried to
force their way into the university's administration building. The rally was
held to underscore demands that the school extend its "living wage" policy to
independent contractors. About seven protesters wrestled with security guards
for about five minutes as they tried to enter the building through a side door.
One guard was bloodied and at least one student received a black eye. Members of
the Student Labor Action Committee want the university to require vendors that
provide services for the school to pay workers the $7.75 hourly wage that
university employees and contract workers are paid.

allegedly forging a prescription. Margaret Loder-Healy, who recently admitted on
ABC's "20/20" to being a heroin addict for years, was nabbed by a plainclothes
policeman after leaving a pharmacy counter, where she picked up two
prescriptions. Police said she called the pharmacy Wednesday, pretending to be a
nurse from a doctor's office who was requesting painkillers and an antibiotic.

Senegal Heads Off Election Violence

	   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- Police and soldiers patrolled sleepy suburbs and
bustling markets Thursday amid scattered political violence just days before
Senegal's most contentious presidential elections in decades. At least six
people were seriously injured and two homes stoned and torched Wednesday evening
in fighting between opposition and ruling party activists in Rufisque, about 15
miles east of the capital, Dakar, political officials said. Senegal has long
been one of Africa's most developed and stable nations, whose business leaders
are often European-educated and renowned for their global trading savvy.

Study: Blacks on TV Are Segregated
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Black characters on TV are strong in number but tend to
be segregated in certain sitcoms and on fledgling networks UPN and WB, according
to a Screen Actors Guild study released today. Conducted by University of
Southern California sociology professor Darnell M. Hunt, the study examined all
comedy and drama series that aired on ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and the two newer
networks during five weeks in 1999. The report comes shortly after the NAACP and
other civil rights groups wrapped up agreements with the four major networks to
commit to more ethnically diverse programming and hiring.

start of the season. Bierk, recalled from Detroit of the IHL on Tuesday, stopped
30 shots in a 4-1 victory over Philadelphia on Nov. 22. Vaclav Prospal had two
goals for Ottawa, which remains three points behind first-place Toronto in the

	   TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- Corey Alexander scored 25 points, including a go-ahead
jumper with 30 seconds remaining, as Fresno State won for the second time this
season against No. 12 Tulsa, 73-72 on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Eric Coley's tip at the buzzer missed for the Golden Hurricane (25-3, 10-2
Western Athletic Conference), who lost 75-73 last month at Fresno State. The
only other team Tulsa has lost to is cross-town rival Oral Roberts, 60-59.
</P>
<P>
	   Courtney Alexander, the nation's leading scorer heading into the game at
25.2 points per game, scored 16 points in the first half and then hit the jumper
down the stretch that put Fresno State (18-9, 8-3) up for good.
</P>
<P>
	   David Shelton led Tulsa with 17 points. Greg Harrington added 16 and Tony
Heard had 14, including 4-of-6 from the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Bulldogs, Melvin Ely had 14 points, while Terrance Roberson and
Demetrius Porter each had 11.
</P>
<P>
	   Fresno State came back after trailing the entire first half when Travis
DeManby made two free throws to start an 11-0 run that tied the game at 62 with
5:48 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Heard returned with a 3-pointer that started a 7-0 Hurricane run to
make it 69-62 with less than four minutes left.
</P>
<P>
	   A basket by Alexander and a 3-pointer by Porter brought Fresno State within
one point with 58.9 left. Harrington turned over the ball at 45.3 seconds,
setting up Alexander's game-winner.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hurricane started the game with four 3-pointers in four minutes,
including three by Heard, and had a 37-30 lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   In the beginning of the second half, Tulsa made three straight 3-pointers,

    MONTREAL (AP) -- Benoit Brunet scored a power-play goal 58 seconds into
overtime to give Montreal a 3-2 victory over New Jersey on Thursday night,
extending the Canadiens' season-high winning streak to seven games.
</P>
<P>
	   Brunet batted the puck out of the air past goalie Martin Brodeur on
Montreal's third shot of overtime. The goal was reviewed to see if the Canadiens
forward made contact with the puck above the level of the crossbar.

	   The Canadiens, 13-4-2 since Jan. 11, moved within two points of the eighth
and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. New Jersey, tied for the
overall NHL lead, has lost four straight -- the Devils' longest losing streak of
the season.
</P>

	   Montreal's Jeff Hackett made 21 saves for his sixth straight victory. The
Canadiens have allowed just five goals in their last six games.

go-ahead jumper with 30 seconds remaining, as Fresno State won for the second
time this season against No. 12 Tulsa, 73-72 on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Eric Coley's tip at the buzzer missed for the Golden Hurricane (25-3, 10-2
Western Athletic Conference), who lost 75-73 last month at Fresno State. The
only other team Tulsa has lost to is cross-town rival Oral Roberts, 60-59.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander, the nation's leading scorer heading into the game at 25.2 points
per game, scored 16 points in the first half and then hit the jumper down the
stretch that put Fresno State (18-9, 8-3) up for good.
</P>
<P>
	   David Shelton led Tulsa with 17 points. Greg Harrington added 16 and Tony
Heard had 14, including 4-of-6 from the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Bulldogs, Melvin Ely had 14 points, while Terrance Roberson and
Demetrius Porter each had 11.
</P>
<P>
	   Fresno State came back after trailing the entire first half when Travis
DeManby made two free throws to start an 11-0 run that tied the game at 62 with
5:48 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Heard returned with a 3-pointer that started a 7-0 Hurricane run to
make it 69-62 with less than four minutes left.
</P>
<P>
	   A basket by Alexander and a 3-pointer by Porter brought Fresno State within
one point with 58.9 left. Harrington turned over the ball at 45.3 seconds,
setting up Alexander's game-winner.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hurricane started the game with four 3-pointers in four minutes,
including three by Heard, and had a 37-30 lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   In the beginning of the second half, Tulsa made three straight 3-pointers,
including two by Hill before Fresno slowly came back.

<HEADLINE> Lautenberg endorses Corzine over Florio in U.S. Senate race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg is endorsing fellow
self-made millionaire Jon Corzine as the Democratic nominee to replace him on
Capitol Hill.
<P>
	   The endorsement will give Corzine a prized edge in his race against former
Gov. Jim Florio in the Democratic Party primary for Lautenberg's seat.
Lautenberg last year announced his retirement after 18 years of representing New
Jersey in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Lautenberg said he made the endorsement in the hope of ending the bickering
between the two that many fear is damaging the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this is a point in time when it's important for us to kind of
declare ourselves. A poll shows him way behind," Lautenberg said of Corzine.
"He's got an imminently good chance of taking the front place in this race, and
I want to help him do it."
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to try to eliminate as much as we can what kind of conflict or
contest we're going to have here," the senator said. "I want to get out of a
squabble as much as is possible."
</P>
<P>
	   The Corzine campaign said Lautenberg's backing would give their candidate
"an enormous stamp of credibility among core Democrats."
</P>
<P>
	   The Florio campaign regretted and dismissed the endorsement. "We are of
course disappointed, but it hasn't changed our strategy, which is not to play
the endorsement game," said Michael Murphy, a cochairman of the Florio campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy said Florio maintains his appeal with rank-and-file party members
among whom Corzine is unknown. He said, "Standing next to Frank Lautenberg does
not automatically overcome a difficult disadvantage, and a virtually
insurmountable one, which is: 'Jon Who?' "
</P>
<P>
	   Lautenberg made his endorsement formal with a public statement at the Bergen
County Democratic Party convention Thursday night in Hackensack.
</P>
<P>
	   In choosing the political newcomer over one of New Jersey's most
battle-scarred veterans, Lautenberg also is turning his back on a former
congressional colleague. Florio was in the House of Representatives when
Lautenberg arrived in Washington, and the two cosponsored key environmental
measures such as the Superfund cleanup law. Florio left the House in 1990 to
become governor.
</P>
<P>
	   "My regard is high for Jim Florio," Lautenberg said. "I think the times have
changed, and it is now time to look forward."
</P>
<P>
	   Lautenberg said he would back Florio vigorously, should he win the
nomination over Corzine on June 6.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic political consultant Pat Politano said he could be taken at his
word. "U.S. senators have a tendency to make friends very fast," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes Senate politics for the Cook Political Report
in Washington, said Lautenberg's move "is fascinating."
</P>
<P>
	   "It breaks with tradition, certainly, of members who stay out of contested
primaries for people who are vying to succeed them," Duffy said. "Finally they
are admitting publicly what we know has been going on behind the scenes: The
establishment backs Jon Corzine."
</P>
<P>
	   Duffy disagrees with Murphy that Corzine's anonymity is a threat. "With or
without Lautenberg, he could probably do it in sheer dollars for ads and phone
banks and mail."
</P>
<P>
	   Like Corzine, Lautenberg was a millionaire executive who had climbed the
corporate ladder from a working-class background and who late in his career
stepped away from the business world to run for national office.
</P>
<P>
	   Corzine was chairman of Goldman Sachs and is largely funding his own
campaign. Neither he nor Lautenberg had been elected to any office prior to
pursuing a U.S. Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
	   "He is the perfect one to carry it out. We share our views. He is a
self-made man," Lautenberg said. "There is a commonality of view when a business
person comes into the picture."
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Goldstein, co-manager of the Corzine campaign and former aide to
Lautenberg, said the retiring senator's endorsement was "the honor of a
political lifetime" because "he is one of the two or three great senators of the
last 40 years in this country."
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, U.S. Rep. Bob Franks, R-New Providence; state Sen.
William Gormley, R-Atlantic; Essex County executive Jim Treffinger; and former
Libertarian candidate for governor Murray Sabrin have announced plans to run.
Gov. Christie Whitman had been an early favorite in the contest before
withdrawing her name in September.

<HEADLINE> Michigan's Crawford Suspended Again  </HEADLINE>
    By HARRY ATKINS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan freshman Jamal Crawford, who had just
finished a six-game NCAA suspension, was suspended for eight more games on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was real disappointed with the ruling," Crawford said after Michigan's
78-75 loss to Purdue, the game that was to have marked Crawford's return from
the first suspension. "I really don't think I did anything wrong. But I have to
live with the ruling."
</P>
<P>
	   The first suspension was for Crawford's living arrangements while a high
school player in Seattle. The eight-game ban came down after it was discovered
Crawford had tried to make himself eligible for the NBA draft while still in
high school and after having signed a letter of intent to play for Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today's ruling had nothing to do with the prior investigation, from the
original ruling of six games," assistant sports information director Tom Wywrot
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The NCAA originally declared Crawford in violation of a rule that prohibits
high school players from declaring themselves eligible for professional sports
leagues' drafts. Crawford signed and sent a letter to the NBA last May, seeking
to declare himself eligible for the June 1999 draft.
</P>
<P>
	   In that letter, which wasn't accepted by the NBA because it arrived too late
to place his name on the draft list, Crawford expressed the mistaken impression
that he wouldn't lose his college eligibility.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was just checking it out," Crawford said. "People said, 'You have some
skills. Check it out.' So, I just thought I would."
</P>
<P>
	   Crawford sent another letter six days later in which he withdrew from the
draft, the NBA said.
</P>
<P>
	   NCAA rules provide a one-time exception for college players who put their
name on the NBA draft list to retain their eligibility if they aren't drafted.
There is no such exception for high school players.
</P>
<P>
	   Venora Skinner told The Seattle Times that her son plans to turn
professional after this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "Jamal is going to enter his name in the draft," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Crawford denied it. He said "without doubt" he would return and play for
Michigan next season.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's my mom talking," Crawford said. "That's not coming from me."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, it would be hard for him to return to Michigan for his sophomore
year, his mother said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only way is if all this pressure stops," Skinner said. "I'm not going
through another year of this. I'm serious."
</P>
<P>
	   After learning about Crawford's letter to the NBA, the ruling body of
college sports said early Thursday that Crawford's college career was finished.
The university appealed and the NCAA came back later in the day with the
eight-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
	   "This ruling was based upon the NBA decision," Wywrot said. "It had nothing
to do with the prior investigation at all. The NCAA, before, withdrew his name
from all games, so essentially Michigan won the appeal."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the university considered the ruling harsh.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are deeply disappointed by the inequity of this decision," university
president Lee Bollinger said in a statement. "Any sensible approach would have
yielded a different result.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do not think Jamal's circumstances warrant this level of severity."
</P>
<P>
	   The first suspension also ordered Crawford to repay $15,000 in benefits he
received from Seattle businessman Barry Henthorn, with whom the player lived for
three years while in high school. On Thursday, the NCAA said Crawford instead
could give $11,300 to the charity of his choice.
</P>
<P>
	   "They took off the money for food, clothing and other expenses," Wywrot
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is very unfortunate, to say the least," Michigan coach Brian Ellerbe
said.
</P>
<P>
	   There are three regular season games left, and the Wolverines are assured of
playing at least one game in the Big Ten tournament. Counting the loss to
Purdue, that's five games. If that's as far as Michigan advances, the remaining
three games of the suspension would be served at the start of next season.
</P>
<P>
	   Wywrot also said Michigan won't have to forfeit any of the games in which
Crawford has appeared.
</P>
<P>
	   Crawford, a 6-foot-6 swingman, was Michigan's leading scorer, averaging 16.6
points per game. The Wolverines are 1-6 without Crawford and have lost eight of
nine games overall. They are 4-9 in the Big Ten and 13-11 overall.

<HEADLINE> Only One Minor NBA Deal Left  </HEADLINE>
    By CHRIS SHERIDAN AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   On the slowest NBA trading deadline day in 13 years, only one minor deal was
made between Orlando and Atlanta. A three-way trade that would have sent Los
Angeles Clippers forward Maurice Taylor to the New York Knicks fell through.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday's lone trade sent guard Anthony Johnson from the Hawks to the Magic
for a conditional second-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal that was scuttled, for reasons that were unclear, would have sent
Taylor to the Knicks, John Wallace from New York to Vancouver and Othella
Harrington from the Grizzlies to the Clippers, several league sources, speaking
on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor was so upset that the deal fell through that he initially refused to
get off the team bus when the Clippers arrived at the Target Center in
Minneapolis for their game against the Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm disappointed," Taylor said. "I had a chance to go to a team that maybe
has a chance to get to the championship."
</P>
<P>
	   "Evidently (the Clippers) chose not to do it, and again that shows you what
type of organization they are," Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor, who has said he won't re-sign with the Clippers when he becomes a
free agent next summer, eventually relented and played in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Not since 1987, when Ben Poquette was the only player traded (going from
Cleveland to Chicago), had there been so slow of a deadline day.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought there would at least be a couple of salary cap related deals,"
Seattle SuperSonics general manager Wally Walker said.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, there were five trades involving 18 players in 1999, four
trades involving 13 players in 1998 and six trades involving 15 players in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   This has been an exceptionally slow season for trades, with only two
completed during the season -- the three-way trade sending Toni Kukoc to
Philadelphia, Larry Hughes to Golden State and John Starks to Chicago; and the
deal that sent Dale Ellis from Milwaukee to Charlotte. Another deal, Danny
Fortson from Boston to Toronto for Alvin Williams and Sean Marks, was nullified
when Williams failed his physical.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clippers were trying to trade Taylor because they feared losing him and
getting nothing in return when he becomes a free agent after the season. The
6-foot-9 power forward is the leading scorer for the Clippers, averaging 17.3
points.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor's agent, David Falk, has said he will demand the maximum allowable
salary for his client when he becomes a free agent. On Tuesday night, Falk said
he would not agree to a sign-and-trade deal over the summer -- even if the
Clippers failed to trade Taylor by the deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   Falk did not return a call Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Knicks had acquired Taylor, they would have acquired his so-called
Larry Bird rights and would have been able to exceed the salary cap even more
than they already have to retain him.
</P>
<P>
	   Knicks general manager Scott Layden refused to comment on any trading
activity.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the team we have, a team of good balance and depth, and we're as
happy after the deadline as we were before it," Layden said.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrington was traded from Houston to Vancouver last summer and has been
unhappy playing in Canada. Wallace signed with the Knicks last summer as a free
agent after playing the previous two seasons in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
	   Another trade that never came off -- even though it was still alive less
than an hour before the 6 p.m. EST deadline -- involved center Ike Austin going
from Washington to Detroit for the rights to Bison Dele, the free-spirited
center who walked away from tens of millions of guaranteed dollars when he
decided to retire last summer at age 30.
</P>
<P>
	   Wizards president of basketball operations Michael Jordan had been eager to
make a deal, but like most everyone else around the league instead found himself
sitting tight with the same players.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's gotten to the point where three-way trades are more common than 1-on-1
trades," Magic general manager John Gabriel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando had been trying to find a taker for forward Derek Strong in order to
clear enough salary cap space to be able to offer maximum salary deals to
upcoming free agents Grant Hill and Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Magic now will have to either work out a sign-and-trade deal or renounce
their rights to guard Ron Mercer if they still plan to offer maximum salaries to
two high-tier free agents this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson, in his third NBA season, averaged 2.4 points and 1.6 assists in 38
games for the Hawks. He will be the third-string point guard in Orlando behind
Darrell Armstrong and Chucky Atkins.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson was originally drafted in the second round, 40th overall, by the
Sacramento Kings.

<TEXT>
<P>
    PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Luke Richardson scored with 8.8 seconds left in
overtime to give the Philadelphia Flyers a 4-3 victory over the Pittsburgh
Penguins on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The defenseman scored only his second goal of the season, putting a wrist
shot high into net from just outside the left crease after taking a pass from
Mark Recchi at the blue line.
</P>
<P>
	   Pittsburgh's Matthew Barnaby tied it at 3 with 6:18 left in the third
period. He tipped in a pass from Darius Kasparaitis just 31 seconds after
Philadelphia's Todd White scored his first NHL goal to give the Flyers a 3-2
lead. White deflected a shot by John LeClair from inside the right circle.
LeClair had three assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Jan Hrdina and Alexei Kovalev also scored for Pittsburgh. Kovalev's
unassisted short-handed goal tied it a 2 with 9:58 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
	   Recchi and Andy Delmore also scored for the Flyers, who are 4-0-1 in their
last five games and have beaten Pittsburgh 12 straight times at home over the
past six seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   Pittsburgh is 2-13-0 in its last 15 road games.
</P>
<P>
	   Both teams played without their top stars for the second straight game.
Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr, the NHL's leading scorer with 85 points, is out
indefinitely with a hamstring injury, while Philadelphia captain Eric Lindros is
day-to-day with a sore back.
</P>
<P>
	   Delmore, who has been recalled from the AHL Philadelphia Phantoms six times
since Oct. 29, scored his first NHL goal to give the Flyers a 1-0 lead at 12:08
of the second period. He connected on a wrist shot from the slot off a pass from
LeClair.
</P>
<P>
	   Hrdina got Pittsburgh even with 1:52 left in the period, slapping in a
rebound of a shot by Jiri Slegr.
</P>
<P>
	   Recchi made it 2-1 only 43 seconds later, wrestling the puck free along the
boards and scoring on a wraparound shot that bounced off the thigh of Penguins
goalie Jean-Sebastien Aubin.
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Neilson attended his first game since relinquishing Philadelphia's
coaching chores for the rest of the regular season to Craig Ramsey after the
Flyers' victory over Washington on Saturday. Neilson, who is battling cancer,
underwent chemotherapy Monday and is scheduled for a stem-cell transplant next
month.

<P>
    HOUSTON (AP) -- Nick Van Exel scored 21 of his 23 points in the first half
as the Denver Nuggets built a big early lead and coasted to a 106-97 victory
over the Houston Rockets on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Van Exel hit nine of 17 shots from the field in the first half as the
Nuggets opened a 61-37 lead. The Rockets never got closer than nine in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver had five players in double figures. George McCloud had 17, followed
by Tariq Abdul-Wahad with 14, Chris Gatling with 13 and Bryant Stith with 12.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuttino Mobley led Houston off the bench with 24, followed by Shandon
Anderson with 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston's Steve Francis was ejected with 3:09 left in the third period after
a flagrant foul on Abdul-Wahad as he drove to the basket.
</P>
<P>
	   Van Exel scored 12 first-quarter points, including eight in the first 3:35
of play.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston managed a 13-12 lead with 5:47 left in the first period. Denver then
outscored the Rockets 11-2 to move ahead 25-15 with 2:47 left in the quarter.
3-pointers by Antonio McDyess and George McCloud in the final minute of the
period boosted the Nuggets to a 34-21 advantage going into the second period.
</P>
<P>
	   Van Exel added nine more second period points as the Nuggets continued their
domination with a 17-0 run for a 53-27 lead with 5:01 remaining in the half.
</P>
<P>
	   A pair of late baskets by Van Exel gave Denver a 61-37 lead at the half.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston had a brief third period rally, outscoring Denver 14-2 to open the
quarter to cut the Nuggets lead to 63-51.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Maryland 76, No. 16 Virginia 71  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- Antonieta Gabriel saved her best for last.
</P>
<P>
	   Playing in her final home game, the seldom-used senior scored a career-high
21 points as Maryland ended a 17-game losing streak against No. 16 Virginia with
a 76-71 victory Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Gabriel entered the game having scored only 17 points against Atlantic Coast
Conference opponents this season. But getting a rare start on Senior Night, she
played a game that she will remember for the rest of her life.
</P>
<P>
	   Gabriel went 9-for-12 from the field and grabbed nine rebounds to help
Maryland (14-12, 5-10) snap a four-game losing streak. It was the Terrapins'
first victory over the Cavaliers since 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   "We tried to keep things as simple as we could tonight," Maryland coach
Chris Weller said. "We wanted to let the players feel free and just play. I'm
just so excited for Antonieta. She's always been a role player for us who is
asked to do all the dirty work. This is her day in the sun."
</P>
<P>
	   Schuye LaRue scored 22 and Svetlana Volnaya had 21 for Virginia (21-7,
12-3). The Cavaliers were outrebounded 48-41 and shot just 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "We got plenty of shots. We just didn't knock them down," Virginia coach
Debbie Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gabriel, who hadn't taken more than eight shots in a game this season,
scored 15 points in the second half alone as Maryland held off a late Virginia
charge.
</P>
<P>
	   After a free throw by Gabriel put Maryland up 72-64 with 49 seconds left,
Renee Robinson hit a 3-pointer for the Cavaliers. The teams traded free throws
before Virginia freshman Telisha Quarles went to the line to shoot three foul
shots.
</P>
<P>
	   She missed all three, and a free throw by Maryland's Vicki Brick iced the
game with 25 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia led by as many as 11 points in the first half, but Maryland pulled
even by halftime.

<HEADLINE> MLS Trial To Start Sept. 18  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- A federal judge set a Sept. 18 trial date Thursday in the
antitrust suit Major League Soccer players filed against the league more than
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Players claim the league violates federal antitrust laws. Rather than have
individual franchises create a league, MLS formed as a single entity and signed
all players to contracts with the league itself, then assigned them to teams.
</P>
<P>
	   The case, filed on Feb. 13, 1997, had been in the discovery phase for many
months.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge George A. O'Toole Jr. made several procedural rulings
during a conference Thursday and set the trial date.
</P>
<P>
	   "While Major League Soccer believes it unfortunate that the players continue
to refuse to seek to resolve their differences with the league through
traditional collective bargaining, MLS looks forward to presenting its case at
trial and remains confident that it will prevail," MLS chief operating officer
Mark Abbott said.

<P>
    HOUSTON (AP) -- Nick Van Exel scored 21 of his 23 points in the first half
as the Denver Nuggets built a big early lead and coasted to a 106-97 victory
over the Houston Rockets on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Van Exel hit nine of 17 shots from the field in the first half as the
Nuggets opened a 61-37 lead. The Rockets never got closer than nine in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver had five players in double figures. George McCloud had 17, followed
by Tariq Abdul-Wahad with 14, Chris Gatling with 13 and Bryant Stith with 12.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuttino Mobley led Houston off the bench with 24, followed by Shandon
Anderson with 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston's Steve Francis was ejected with 3:09 left in the third period after
a flagrant foul on Abdul-Wahad as he drove to the basket.
</P>
<P>
	   Van Exel scored 12 first-quarter points, including eight in the first 3:35
of play.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston managed a 13-12 lead with 5:47 left in the first period. Denver then
outscored the Rockets 11-2 to move ahead 25-15 with 2:47 left in the quarter.
3-pointers by Antonio McDyess and George McCloud in the final minute of the
period boosted the Nuggets to a 34-21 advantage going into the second period.
</P>
<P>
	   Van Exel added nine more second period points as the Nuggets continued their
domination with a 17-0 run for a 53-27 lead with 5:01 remaining in the half.
</P>
<P>
	   A pair of late baskets by Van Exel gave Denver a 61-37 lead at the half.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston had a brief third period rally, outscoring Denver 14-2 to open the
quarter to cut the Nuggets lead to 63-51.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver responded with an 18-4 run and led 85-64 going into the final period.

<HEADLINE> Balloonist Tries 2nd Solo Voyage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The man who hopes to become the first hot air balloonist to
circle the globe alone was slowly making his way toward Puerto Rico on Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Uliassi was cruising at roughly 25 mph in his 160-foot balloon at an
altitude of about 21,000 feet. He successfully maneuvered around thunderstorms
storms as he flew over the Dominican Republic but was headed for more, said Todd
Little, who was at Uliassi's the flight's command center in suburban Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is unlikely they will have serious implications for the balloon,''
Little said.
</P>
<P>
	   Uliassi had planned to climb to a higher altitude Friday to catch stronger
winds that would carry him to Africa, where he hoped to be in seven days.
</P>
<P>
	   Uliassi, 36, who quit his job three years ago to make the flight, lifted off
early Tuesday from a stone quarry near Rockford, Ill. He hopes to complete the
flight in 14 to 20 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Uliassi is communicating with his wife and friends by computer and
telephone, and occasionally chats with pilots of passing airliners.
</P>
<P>
	   It is the second attempt for Uliassi, who lives in Scottsdale, Ariz. In
December 1997, the bottom of his balloon ruptured over O'Hare International
Airport, forcing Uliassi down in Indiana not long after he took off from the
Chicago area.

<HEADLINE> Miss. Has Black Student Body Head  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL PAYNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- The University of Mississippi, which has struggled
for decades to overcome its reputation of racial discrimination, on Thursday
elected its first black student body president.
</P>
<P>
	   Nic Lott, a political science major, beat Scott Walker, a white business
major, 1,056 votes to 922 votes.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott, president of the statewide College Republicans, said race played no
role in the election.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I haven't made an issue of it,'' Lott said. ``I'm running to represent all
Ole Miss students.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ole Miss gained notoriety in 1962 when students rioted in protest of the
registration of James Meredith, the school's first black student. Now blacks
make up about 12 percent of the university's 10,000 students.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott campaigned for the establishment of a House of Representatives in
student government. Ole Miss has only a Senate. Walker's campaign focused on
moving the Ole Miss band to a different location at football games.
</P>
<P>
	   Black student leaders at Ole Miss said Lott's election could help mend race
relations, which became strained this month after a brick that had a note
containing racial epithets attached was thrown through a dormitory director's
window.
</P>
<P>
	   After that, a flier about Black History Month was torn down and replaced
with a computer-generated graphic showing a monkey eating an apple, racial slurs
and a Confederate flag.

<HEADLINE> Diallo Jury Resumes Deliberations  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Jurors deliberating in the murder trial of four white
police officers who shot an unarmed black man asked the judge Thursday to reread
them the law on a less serious charge: first-degree manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
	   Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi explained that unlike second-degree
murder -- which requires proof the officers intended to kill Amadou Diallo --
manslaughter means they only intended to cause serious injury.
</P>
<P>
	   During his instructions before deliberations began Wednesday, Teresi gave
the jury the option of considering charges other than murder. The jurors
deliberated late into the night Thursday before telling the judge there was
testimony they wanted to have read back to them on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The jurors were to be sequestered for the night.
</P>
<P>
	   Sean Carroll, 37, Edward McMellon, 27, Kenneth Boss, 28, and Richard Murphy,
27, each have pleaded innocent to second-degree murder. Conviction on that
charge carries a sentence of anywhere from 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Penalties for first-degree manslaughter range from 5 to 25 years. Other
lesser charges include second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent
homicide, which could result in a sentence of probation without jail time.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense claims Diallo ignored the officers' repeated orders to halt,
pulled out a black object in a threatening manner and remained on his feet as
bullets flew. The object turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   The verdict could hinge on the defense claim that the officers unleashed the
barrage because they thought Diallo had a gun and was threatening them.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge has instructed jurors, ``A person who acts in self-defense is not
guilty of any crime.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the jury also asked to be read transcripts of the testimony of
Boss, Murphy, and eyewitness Schrrie Elliott. Earlier, they heard a transcript
of testimony from Carroll and McMellon, who were the first to confront and shoot
at Diallo. Boss and Murphy testified that they fired to back up their partners.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott claims she watched from across the street when Diallo died in a hail
of 41 bullets on Feb. 4, 1999. The West African immigrant was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   When she first took the stand, Elliott appeared to hurt the defense by
supporting allegations that the officers cornered Diallo in the tiny vestibule
of his apartment building with their guns drawn and, without warning, opened
fire. She also said the victim remained upright throughout most of the gunfire.
</P>
<P>
	   But pressed by the defense, Elliott also admitted making statements to both
federal authorities and a news reporter that one of the officers shouted ``He's
got a gun!'' before the shooting began. Prosecutors have said Elliott's account
has changed too many times to be reliable.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia President Ordered To Rest  </HEADLINE>
   By GEOFF SPENCER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A day after being diagnosed with influenza,
Indonesia's frail President Abdurrahman Wahid took a second day off work Friday,
aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was ordered to stay in his room by the doctors,'' said one palace
official speaking on condition of anonymity. ``All his programs have been
canceled.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid denied Thursday that he was seriously ill after doctors ordered him to
rest for several days and to cancel official engagements.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid joked with reporters Thursday and appeared relatively healthy. Despite
his illness, he hosted a private dinner for visiting dignitaries from Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   The 59-year-old head of state is nearly blind, suffers from diabetes and has
had a series of strokes in recent years. He finds it difficult to walk unaided.
</P>
<P>
	   The Muslim cleric and democratic reformer is regarded as central to
Indonesia's chances of recovering from economic and political turmoil. Confusion
over his condition made financial markets jittery. The Jakarta Stock Exchange
index dropped 2 percent Thursday and the value of the currency, the rupiah, also
slid.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday and Friday were Wahid's first days off for illness since he took
charge of the world's fourth-most populous nation four months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president has been advised to rest,'' said Dr. Mohammad Tony Soufyan,
the head of Wahid's five-member medical team. ``In general, his condition is
good.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cabinet Secretary Marsilam Simanjuntak said the president postponed a
scheduled Friday visit to west and central Java island. A scheduled Sunday trip
to the neighboring oil-rich sultanate of Brunei also was called off.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid has had two strokes in recent years and underwent brain surgery to
stop internal bleeding in early 1998. Questions about his health have dogged him
since he took office last October.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, he has subjected himself to a punishing daily schedule and long
hours in his quest to introduce democratic change, fix the battered economy and
end several bloody communal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
	   As well as extensive tours of islands across sprawling Indonesia, he has
visited a long list of countries on several whirlwind diplomatic tours. In his
most recent overseas trip earlier this month, he visited 15 cities in the Middle
East, Europe and Asia in 16 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials did not say whether Wahid would go ahead with a planned visit to
East Timor next Tuesday. The visit would be the first by an Indonesian head of
state since the half-island territory broke away from Indonesian rule last year,
triggering a wave of violence by pro-Jakarta militiamen.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Recommends Changes to Boats  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID A. LIEB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The National Transportation Safety Board on
Thursday urged owners of amphibious tourist boats to install backup flotation
devices because of risks that the vessels could sink rapidly.
</P>
<P>
	   The recommendation comes in response to the sinking of the Miss Majestic, a
World War II-vintage boat that sank last May in Hot Springs, killing 13 people.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coast Guard concluded that a dislodged seal allowed water to flood the
hull of the Miss Majestic, and the boat's bilge pump failed to work.
</P>
<P>
	   The NTSB said boat operators should not rely on the pumps only, recommending
the installation of backup flotation devices -- watertight bulkheads, buoyant
materials inside the hull or flotation attachments on the outside of the boat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The safety board concludes that the potential exists for another
life-threatening accident similar to the sinking of the Miss Majestic, unless
the vulnerability to flooding and sinking is addressed,'' the NTSB said in a
letter to the industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationwide, more than 250 amphibious passenger boats are in service.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 18 amphibious boats had accidents -- six involving some degree of
flooding -- between March 6, 1991, and May 1, 1999, according to Coast Guard
data. None was fatal.
</P>
<P>
	   The safety board said it has learned of at least nine other incidents
involving significant flooding that were not reported to the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
	   Some tourist boat owners said the NTSB suggestions may not be necessary. The
NTSB asked the industry to respond to the recommendations within 90 days.

<HEADLINE> Japan Baby Dies After No Transplant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- An 18-month old Japanese girl considered too ill to survive a
heart-lung-liver transplant in the United States died the day after returning to
Japan, a hospital official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Akari Saino, who was born with a severe congenital heart defect, died on
Thursday in northern Japan, said Shinichi Torii, spokesman for Sapporo Medical
College.
</P>
<P>
	   The girl's parents brought her to Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital
at Stanford University in California in late January to be put on a waiting list
for a heart-lung transplant.
</P>
<P>
	   But doctors found that she would also need a liver transplant, and
determined that she was too weak to survive the surgery. Only 10
heart-lung-liver transplants have been performed, all on adults.
</P>
<P>
	   The family returned to Japan on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Transplants are extremely rare in Japan, where certain transplant procedures
were illegal until recently. Many Japanese still travel to the United States for
transplants that are difficult or impossible at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan outlaws heart-lung transplants for patients under 15.
</P>
<P>
	   The case has drawn attention in Japan, where the Save Akari Foundation set
up by her parents had raised over 100 million yen (dlrs 900,000) to pay for the
girl's travel to the United States and treatment, Kyodo News agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Jazz 92, Mavericks 85  </HEADLINE>
    By JAIME ARON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- Dennis Rodman and Karl Malone revived their basketball and
wrestling rivalry, and Bryon Russell scored 25 points to help the Utah Jazz hold
off the Dallas Mavericks 92-85 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodman was ejected for the second time in his five games with the Mavericks.
His second technical came with 4:02 left for arguing a foul called when Malone
tripped over him while running up the court. A similar incident in the third
quarter drew a double foul.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodman had 12 rebounds, his fewest as a Maverick, and scored one point on a
free throw with his eyes closed. He was laughing so hard afterward that when he
tried it again, the shot ticked the front of the net, narrowly avoiding an air
ball.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodman, who got his first technical moaning about an illegal defense in the
third quarter, continued griping for several minutes after his ejection. Once
teammates and coaches convinced him to leave, his traditional jersey-toss into
the stands triggered a courtside fight between the team doctor and a fan.
</P>
<P>
	   This was second ejection in a row at home. His slow exit last time got him
suspended for a game and this one could, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah had broken a tie to go ahead 77-72 when Rodman was tossed. The Jazz
stretched the lead to 82-72 and the Mavericks never got closer than five after
that.
</P>
<P>
	   This was the 12th straight time Utah has beaten Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	   Malone came to Dallas a marked man because a month earlier he tussled with
center Shawn Bradley, then went chest-to-chest with coach Don Nelson. Malone and
Nelson ended up getting fined $10,000 and Nelson was suspended for one game.
Rodman's recent signing with the Mavericks made things even more likely to
escalate.
</P>
<P>
	   Physical and verbal jabs were thrown throughout the first half, but they
seemed to mainly motivate the Mavericks and their sellout crowd. Dallas overcame
several deficits, but never led by more than three.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mavericks' rallies were usually paced by reserves Cedric Ceballos and
Erick Strickland. Ceballos had 26 points and Strickland 16. Dallas starters
scored just 32 points, led by Michael Finley's 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Malone, who wore his typical game-face scowl all night, finished with 18
points, 10 rebounds and six assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Hornacek scored 14 and had a season-high seven rebounds. Greg Ostertag,
a Dallas-area native, had a season-best six blocks. Notes: Utah has won six of
seven since ending a six-game losing streak. ... Dallas is 1-4 with Rodman in
the lineup. This also was the Mavs' third sellout, two with Rodman. ... Robert
Pack returned from a 28-game absence caused by a sprained ankle. He started for
Dallas and scored five points. ... The game featured two finalists from NBA
3-point contest, winner Jeff Hornacek of Utah and runner-up Dirk Nowitzki of
Dallas. Hornacek was 0-for-1 on 3-pointers and Nowitzki went 1-for-5.

<P>
   DINWIDDIE, Va. (AP) -- A man suspected of planting bombs that exploded
beneath two pickup trucks and outside a business was shot and wounded Thursday
by police after he was discovered hiding under a church.
</P>
<P>
	   Luis Cristobal, a 47-year-old Cuban citizen, had been sought since Feb. 7.
Police said he planted bombs under trucks owned by Cristobal's brother-in-law
and a man acquainted with Cristobal's estranged wife. The third bomb was placed
outside a building where Cristobal used to work.
</P>
<P>
	   The acquaintance of Cristobal's wife suffered a leg injury. The
brother-in-law was uninjured. No one was hurt at the business bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   After getting tips from several people, a police officer found Cristobal in
a crawl space beneath Dinwiddie Church of Christ, where the suspect is a member.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He crawled in there just as an exploratory search,'' state police
spokeswoman Corinne Geller said. ``He crawled in there expecting to see cobwebs,
and instead found Cristobal pointing a gun at him.''
</P>
<P>
	   The fugitive was asked to put down the gun and would not, so the officer
fired, Geller said. Cristobal was in stable condition from the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Bomb squads found an explosive device, an assault rifle with a large amount
of ammunition and a sleeping bag in the crawl space, Geller said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists Argue Over Gore  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DOBBS FERRY, N.Y. (AP) -- On the haze-draped banks of the Hudson River, Vice
President Al Gore picked up an endorsement Thursday from the New York League of
Conservation Voters. But Friends of the Earth, which backs Bill Bradley, accused
Gore of selling out on his promise to protect wetlands.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore used the occasion of his endorsement, which included backing by
prominent New York Republican and environmentalist Larry Rockefeller, to
criticize GOP presidential candidates John McCain and George W. Bush for the
second straight day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For these candidates clean air really is an act. Clean water is too,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore campaign released a television ad in which Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
says, ``There is no American political leader in our history with a greater
understanding or commitment to environmental protection than Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
	   The airing of the 30-second spot coincided with an article in the Feb. 28
issue of The American Prospect magazine. The article quotes Kennedy as one of
several environmentalists disturbed by the Clinton-Gore administration's support
for a federal-state plan permitting construction of a shopping mall by the Mills
Corp. on 500 acres of wetlands in New Jersey's Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
	   Friends of the Earth Political Action Committee, which endorsed Bradley last
fall at least partly to show its frustration with the administration, said in a
news release that executives, contractors and family members of the Mills Corp.
have given Gore $43,000 for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Calling the mall project an outrageous assault on wetlands, Kennedy told the
magazine: ``It is disappointing to see Al Gore, who I admire, succumb to this
kind of mercenary approach.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy was out of the country on Thursday, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I make you this pledge -- that if you entrust me with the presidency I
will not let you down. I will fight with everything I've got to protect the
environment here in New York, all through our country, and around our world. I
will not let you down. That's not to say we will agree 100 percent on
everything,'' Gore told his riverside audience of about 100 supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   A gauzy haze obliterated what Gore aides had hoped would give him a scenic
backdrop. What was visible instead, over Gore's shoulder, was the work of
demonstrators on a nearby outcropping: a giant black spider straddling a globe.
</P>
<P>
	   Across the continent, Bradley set up temporary shop in Washington state,
driving hard for a win in its nonbinding Feb. 29 primary. There, he began airing
a two-minute biographical TV ad designed to help with his still-poor name
recognition. And he released a 30-second commercial that hits several of his
national themes and one of parochial interest. ``Only Bill Bradley fought to
protect our salmon on the Elwah River,'' the ad says, latching onto a hot
environmental issue in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
	   Trying again to undermine Gore on the core issues of his front-running
campaign, Bradley told his audience at the University of Washington that Gore
spent 16 years in Congress but introduced just four bills addressing education.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al Gore was the conservative Democrat,'' Bradley said. ``He's a
conservative who picks weapons over classrooms.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley argued anew that Gore is a closet conservative, not just in the
past, when he was an anti-abortion-choice, pro-gun congressman from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   He said, ``Washington has the opportunity to send a message to the country.
I need your help.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was making his own environmental presentation late Thursday in
Olympia. And back in New York, Gore accepted the New York environmental group's
endorsement with rare, kind words for his rival.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bill Bradley does have a good environmental record and I acknowledge
that,'' Gore said. ``But I deeply appreciate your willingness to look at not
only the two very similar records on votes but also to go beyond that and look
at leadership, because I've worked hard.''
</P>
<P>
	   The national, Washington-based League of Conservation Voters is not likely
to choose sides in the Democratic primary, said Lisa Wade, the group's
communications director.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, the group gave Bradley an 84-percent approval rating for his
environmental record during the 18 years he represented New Jersey in the
Senate. Gore earned a 64 percent rating.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Thursday, Gore visited the Orthodox Jewish community of New Square,
outside New York. All 7,000 in the Hasidic community greeted Gore -- the women
lined the village streets, one of which is named for President Clinton, while
the men and boys applauded Gore's speech inside the synagogue.
</P>
<P>
	   Wearing a yarmulke and using a few Yiddish words, Gore argued for a national
hate crimes law and support for Israel. Asked if the vice president had any
problems speaking to a group that separates men and women, his spokesman Chris
Lehane said, ``His views on equal rights are clear -- abundantly clear.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, working to stave off Bradley's criticism of his abortion record,
Gore released a new radio ad for Washington state featuring Kristina Kiehl, a
founder of Voters for Choice. ``I'm disappointed Bill Bradley has chosen to
attack Al Gore on abortion rights, simply for political gain,'' she says in the
ad. ``The fact is both Bill Bradley and Al Gore are strongly pro-choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Clinton told a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser that the
next president may be in position to name three or four Supreme Court justices
-- and reminded the party faithful of what that could mean for abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Democratic candidates for president will support maintaining a woman's
right to choose and will act accordingly,'' Clinton said Thursday night in New
York. ``The Republican candidates won't, and will act accordingly.''

<HEADLINE> Diallo jury ends second day without verdict  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Jurors in the murder trial of four white police
officers who shot an unarmed black man ended a second day of deliberations
Thursday without a verdict, but they did seek guidance about the meaning of less
serious charges against the defendants.
<P>
	   Before leaving, the jury also wrote the last of several notes to Supreme
Court Justice Joseph Teresi, saying that Friday morning it wanted to be re-read
transcripts of testimony by defendants Sean Carroll and Edward McMellon about
the moments leading up to the shooting of Amadou Diallo. It also asked for the
testimony of an expert witness on police tactics, and for clarification on laws
allowing police officers to claim self-defense.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury deliberated more than 11 hours ending at 11 p.m. before being
sequestered for the night.
</P>
<P>
	   "You never know what they're thinking," defense attorney James Culleton
said. "It sounds like they're going through the charges step-by-step. There's no
way to tell. We're not in the room."
</P>
<P>
	   During his instructions, Teresi gave the jury the option of considering a
range of charges other than murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Thursday, jurors asked judge about manslaughter. He explained that
unlike second-degree murder - which requires proof the officers intended to
murder Diallo - manslaughter means they only sought to cause serious injury.
</P>
<P>
	   Penalties for first-degree manslaughter range from 5 to 25 years.
</P>
<P>
	   By evening, jurors requested that Teresi read them the law on second-degree
manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. Those charges, respectively,
apply when someone recklessly causes death or fails to perceive the risk of
death. Both carry sentences that could be as light as probation.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, 37, McMellon, 27, Kenneth Boss, 28, and Richard Murphy, 27, each
have pleaded innocent to second-degree murder. Conviction on that charge carries
a sentence of anywhere from 15 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   At trial, the officers testified that Diallo ignored their repeated orders
to halt, pulled out a black object in a threatening manner and remained on his
feet as bullets flew. The object turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   The verdict could hinge on the defense claim that the officers unleashed the
barrage because they thought Diallo had a gun and was threatening them. The
judge has instructed jurors, "A person who acts in self-defense is not guilty of
any crime."
</P>
<P>
	   The officers were members of a roving unit plainclothes unit that has been
accused by some of stopping and frisking young black men without cause. Diallo's
slaying sparked such intense publicity and so many protests that the case was
moved to Albany; more than 100 people packed into a Bronx church, near Diallo's
home, Wednesday night to hear politicians and religious leaders call for calm.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the jury also asked to be read transcripts from the testimony
of Boss, Murphy, and eyewitness Schrrie Elliott.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, they heard nearly all the testimony from Carroll and McMellon, who
were the first to confront and shoot at Diallo. Boss and Murphy testified that
they fired to back up their partners.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott claims she watched from across the street when Diallo died in a hail
of 41 bullets on Feb. 4, 1999. The West African immigrant was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   When she first took the stand, Elliott appeared to hurt the defense by
supporting allegations that the officers cornered Diallo in the tiny vestibule
of his apartment building with their guns drawn and, without warning, opened
fire. She also said the victim remained upright throughout most of the gunfire.
</P>
<P>
	   But pressed by the defense, Elliott also admitted making statements to both
federal authorities and a news reporter that one of the officers shouted "He's
got a gun!" before the shooting began. Prosecutors have said Elliott's account
has changed too many times to be reliable.

<HEADLINE> Only One Minor NBA Deal Left  </HEADLINE>
    By CHRIS SHERIDAN AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   On the slowest NBA trading deadline day in 13 years, only one minor deal was
made between Orlando and Atlanta. A three-way trade that would have sent Los
Angeles Clippers forward Maurice Taylor to the New York Knicks fell through.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday's lone trade sent guard Anthony Johnson from the Hawks to the Magic
for a conditional second-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal that was scuttled, for reasons that were unclear, would have sent
Taylor to the Knicks, John Wallace from New York to Vancouver and Othella
Harrington from the Grizzlies to the Clippers, several league sources, speaking
on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor was so upset that the deal fell through that he initially refused to
get off the team bus when the Clippers arrived at the Target Center in
Minneapolis for their game against the Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor, who has said he won't re-sign with the Clippers when he becomes a
free agent next summer, eventually relented and played in Los Angeles' 116-91
loss to the Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm disappointed," Taylor said. "I had a chance to go to a team that maybe
has a chance to get to the championship."
</P>
<P>
	   "Evidently (the Clippers) chose not to do it, and again that shows you what
type of organization they are," Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Not since 1987, when Ben Poquette was the only player traded (going from
Cleveland to Chicago), had there been only one player dealt on deadline day.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought there would at least be a couple of salary cap related deals,"
Seattle SuperSonics general manager Wally Walker said.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, there were five trades involving 18 players in 1999, four
trades involving 13 players in 1998 and six trades involving 15 players in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   This has been an exceptionally slow season for trades, with only three
completed during the season -- the three-way trade sending Toni Kukoc to
Philadelphia, Larry Hughes to Golden State and John Starks to Chicago; the deal
that sent Dale Ellis from Milwaukee to Charlotte; and one sending Ron Mercer
from Denver to Orlando for Chris Gatling and Tariq Andul-Wahad. Another deal,
Danny Fortson from Boston to Toronto for Alvin Williams and Sean Marks, was
nullified when Williams failed his physical.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clippers were trying to trade Taylor because they feared losing him and
getting nothing in return when he becomes a free agent after the season. The
6-foot-9 power forward is the leading scorer for the Clippers, averaging 17.3
points.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor's agent, David Falk, has said he will demand the maximum allowable
salary for his client when he becomes a free agent. On Tuesday night, Falk said
he would not agree to a sign-and-trade deal over the summer -- even if the
Clippers failed to trade Taylor by the deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   Falk did not return a call Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Knicks had acquired Taylor, they would have acquired his so-called
Larry Bird rights and would have been able to exceed the salary cap even more
than they already have to retain him.
</P>
<P>
	   Knicks general manager Scott Layden refused to comment on any trading
activity.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the team we have, a team of good balance and depth, and we're as
happy after the deadline as we were before it," Layden said.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrington was traded from Houston to Vancouver last summer and has been
unhappy playing in Canada. Wallace signed with the Knicks last summer as a free
agent after playing the previous two seasons in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
	   Another trade that never came off -- even though it was still alive less
than an hour before the 6 p.m. EST deadline -- involved center Ike Austin going
from Washington to Detroit for the rights to Bison Dele, the free-spirited
center who walked away from tens of millions of guaranteed dollars when he
decided to retire last summer at age 30.
</P>
<P>
	   Wizards president of basketball operations Michael Jordan had been eager to
make a deal, but like most everyone else around the league instead found himself
sitting tight with the same players.
</P>
<P>
	   "What happens in the summertime is a different matter," Jordan said. "I
think in terms of trying to make a trade with the deadline, teams are not
willing to move quickly or disrupt the chemistry they have."
</P>
<P>
	   Said Magic general manager John Gabriel: "It's gotten to the point where
three-way trades are more common than 1-on-1 trades."
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando had been trying to find a taker for forward Derek Strong in order to
clear enough salary cap space to be able to offer maximum salary deals to
upcoming free agents Grant Hill and Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Magic now will have to either work out a sign-and-trade deal or renounce
their rights to Mercer if they still plan to offer maximum salaries to two
high-tier free agents this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson, in his third NBA season, averaged 2.4 points and 1.6 assists in 38
games for the Hawks. He will be the third-string point guard in Orlando behind
Darrell Armstrong and Chucky Atkins.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson was originally drafted in the second round, 40th overall, by the
Sacramento Kings.

<HEADLINE> Diallo Jury Resumes Deliberations  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Jurors deliberating in the murder trial of four white
police officers who shot an unarmed black man asked the judge Thursday to reread
them the law on a less serious charge: first-degree manslaughter.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jordan Rips Wizards' Dedication  </HEADLINE>
    By JOSEPH WHITE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Michael Jordan wasn't able to pull off a deal to help his
awful team. Then he watched his players get beat badly and ripped them for
lacked of dedication.
</P>
<P>
	   Jordan explored whether he could unload one of the Washington Wizards
overpriced threesome -- Juwan Howard, Rod Strickland or Mitch Richmond -- but
nobody wanted to take on their high salaries and mediocre stats. Shortly after
the 6 p.m. EST trading deadline passed, Jordan retreated to the owners' box and
watched the Wizards fall behind early and lose 92-83 to the Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think it's a lack of talent," said Jordan, who became the team's
president of basketball operations and a part-owner last month.
</P>
<P>
	   "They need dedication for each and every game that you step on the
basketball court. That's an area of improvement for this team, and I will demand
it. Until I walk away from this position, each and every time you step on the
court you bring forth the same effort."
</P>
<P>
	   Howard, Strickland and Richmond are making $35 million this year, which
already puts the Wizards over the salary cap, and their contracts run for at
least two more seasons. Howard and Richmond are having the worst seasons of
their careers, and Strickland isn't doing much better. The Wizards are 16-39.
</P>
<P>
	   And, with a new luxury tax due on the horizon for teams that are well over
the cap, the Wizards are in a bind Jordan can't fix.
</P>
<P>
	   "Right now we have three situations, three contracts that put us right in
the area that you have to deal with the luxury tax," Jordan said. "If it's a
successful situation and they're producing and we're winning, I'm not afraid and
I'm pretty sure the management will forfeit some of the luxury tax.
</P>
<P>
	   "But if it's within a losing situation where we're not really successful,
then quite naturally we have to evaluate and move some of those big contracts."
</P>
<P>
	   Jordan said some of the inquiries he had give him encouragement that a deal
could be made in the offseason. Meanwhile, he's dealing with a lot of losing.
Firing coach Gar Heard and hiring Darrell Walker hasn't helped the won-loss
record.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a little frustrating," Jordan said. "It's something I won't get used
to. It's OK that we're going through a transitional period with the coaching
change with not really the continuity among this team, but very soon I will
demand some type of compromise amongst the talent on this team."
</P>
<P>
	   Jordan also said he supported general manager Wes Unseld, who has accepted a
five-year contract extension that was on the table before Jordan arrived. The
extension appears to go against Jordan's initial pledge that everyone was
expendable while he evaluated the organization.
</P>
<P>
	   "He adds a lot of knowledge to this team," Jordan said. "He adds a lot of
knowledge to me."

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Package Bomb Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERETT, Mass. (AP) -- A man accused of stalking a woman who was killed last
month by a package bomb was charged in her death Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Steven Caruso, 44, was the initial suspect in the Jan. 20 killing of Sandra
Berfield, 32, who had sought a restraining order against him.
</P>
<P>
	   He has been in jail on probation violations and weapons charges since police
investigating the bombing found four unlicensed guns, a stun gun and ammunition
at his house.
</P>
<P>
	   District Attorney Martha Coakley said investigators also found evidence
consistent with the bomb and papers showing that he had a motive to kill her,
although she wouldn't describe the papers.
</P>
<P>
	   Caruso's lawyer, Elliott Levine, did not immediately return a message.
</P>
<P>
	   Berfield, a waitress, sought court protection against Caruso in 1998 after
she said he was stalking her at work. Friends said she was so afraid of him that
she slept with a knife and installed a surveillance camera at her home.
</P>
<P>
	   In May, Caruso was sentenced to six months in jail after being convicted of
malicious destruction of property on Berfield's car. He was released in July.

Texas Executes Convicted Killer
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A 62-year-old woman was executed by injection
Thursday after Gov. George W. Bush rejected her claim that she killed her fifth
husband in self-defense and deserved a reprieve. Betty Lou Beets became the
fourth woman to be executed in the United States since the Supreme Court in 1976
allowed the death penalty to resume. She was the second woman executed in Texas
since the Civil War. She gave no final statement as she lay strapped to the
death chamber gurney. She made no eye contact with the victim's family, but
smiled at her attorney and a spiritual adviser watching through a window at her
side. She continued smiling as she slipped into unconsciousness.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Denouncing violence in the name of religion as "an
offense against God," Pope John Paul II called for tolerance on Thursday as he
began a visit to Egypt, where clashes between Muslims and Christians recently
left 23 people dead. The pontiff's three-day Egypt trip also gave him an
opportunity to promote closer dialogue with Muslims and to try to overcome old
rifts with Orthodox Christians. The pope raised the issue of tolerance among
religious groups, speaking in general terms, as is his custom.

Gulf Nations OK Oil Production Hike

	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Persian Gulf oil ministers have agreed
to increase production of crude to stabilize prices around the world, but have
not decided how much -- leaving it unclear whether consumers will find relief at
the gas pumps. A senior United Arab Emirates oil official said Thursday that
Gulf Arab oil ministers who met the day before in Saudi Arabia agreed to a
production increase. Such a move could bring down oil prices, which have been
hovering near a nine-year high. The official said a production increase will be
gradual and will be in the range of 1.5 million barrels a day, or 6 percent
above current levels.

	   DINWIDDIE, Va. (AP) -- A man suspected of planting bombs that exploded
beneath two pickup trucks and outside a business was shot and wounded Thursday
by police after he was discovered hiding under a church. Luis Cristobal, a
47-year-old Cuban citizen, had been sought since Feb. 7. Police said he planted
bombs under trucks owned by Cristobal's brother-in-law and a man acquainted with
Cristobal's estranged wife. The third bomb was placed outside a building where
Cristobal used to work. The fugitive was asked to put down the gun and would
not, so the officer fired, Geller said. Cristobal was in stable condition from
the shooting.

Miss. Has Black Student Body Head

	   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- The University of Mississippi, which has struggled
for decades to overcome its reputation of racial discrimination, on Thursday
elected its first black student body president. Nic Lott, a political science
major, beat Scott Walker, a white business major, 1,056 votes to 922 votes.
Lott, president of the statewide College Republicans, said race played no role
in the election. Ole Miss gained notoriety in 1962 when students rioted in
protest of the registration of James Meredith, the school's first black student.
Now blacks make up about 12 percent of the university's 10,000 students.
