<HEADLINE> DPRK Demands U.S., S. Korea Apology on Submarine Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) on Thursday held the United States and South Korea
responsible for the suicide of nine crewmen in a DPRK submarine.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant General Ri Chan Bok, of the Korean People's Army of
the DPRK, demanded apology from the United States and South Korea
at a meeting with the United Nations Command in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the third one between general-level officers, was
held in Panmunjom, the armistice village in the demilitarized zone
separating the Korean Peninsula into the DPRK and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Ri, senior delegate of the DPRK side, was quoted by the Korean
Central News Agency as saying that the submarine was wrecked in
open seas due to an engine trouble during a routine training on
June 22.
</P>
<P>
Far from taking measures to rescue the wrecked submarine under
international law, Ri said, South Korea sent warships and aircraft
in indiscriminate attack, "so that the submarine overturned."
</P>
<P>
South Korean soldiers broke the aerial of the submarine and
pulled it for a long time before it sank, he said, adding that the
crewmen "had no alternative but to kill themselves," as they were
unable to send out distress signals.
</P>
<P>
However, South Korea said earlier the submarine infiltrated
into its waters, violating the armistice that ended the Korean War
in 1953.
</P>
<P>
South Korea also found a body on the sea off its Kangwon
Province on July 12. Seoul believes the dead man was a DPRK
infiltrator.
</P>
<P>
It is ridiculous that Seoul described the man as an "armed spy
who intruded into South Korea," said Ri.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Seoul to return the submarine at an early date.

During his stay here, Talbott will hold talks with the

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Falls Sharply in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. industrial production
fell 0.6 percent in June, the steepest drop in five years, the
Federal Reserve reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The monthly decline was the sharpest since the index fell 0.9
percent in March 1991.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the decline was attributed to an 11 percent
dropoff in automotive production, blamed mainly for the lingering
GM strike, started from June 5.
</P>
<P>
Outside of the auto industry, the performance was lackluster.
Output at factories other than auto, trucks and parts plants rose
just 0.1 percent in June following a 0.1 percent decline in May.
Utility output increased 0.4 percent in June while production at
mines and oil wells fell 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The overall drop in industrial production was larger than
economists expected from the GM strike alone and fit with the
notion that Asia's economic turmoil is slowing the U.S. economy by
knocking down demand for U.S. exports to the region.
</P>
<P>
The operating rate at industrial firms ran at 81.6 percent of
capacity, the lowest in five years and down from 82.4 percent in
May. Just at factories, the operating rate declined to 80.3
percent, also the lowest in five years and down from 81.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
That's been reflected in recent inflation reports, which show
prices virtually unchanged for goods but up at a moderate rate of
nearly 3 percent for services, which are feeling the squeeze of
labor shortages in many occupations.
</P>
<P>
Despite the overall weakness of June's report, there were
area's of strength. Industrial equipment production shot up 2.2
percent, with strong increases for construction machinery, farm
machinery and computers and other office equipment. Semiconductor
and clothing output also rose.
</P>
<P>
However, production of home appliances and carpeting fell.

NEW YORK, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Coca-Cola Company reported
Thursday that its second-quarter unit case volume increased 10
percent with share of sales continuing to expand both in the
United States and throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Its worldwide unit case volume increased 12 percent for the
first six months of the year. Worldwide gallon shipments grew 9
percent for the second quarter and have grown 12 percent for the
first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The company reported its net income at 1.191 billion U.S.
dollars for the second quarter, a 9 percent increase over the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In its regional growth, Latin America saw the largest
increase of 12 percent in the second quarter and Asia market had
only 7 percent increase for its sales.
</P>
<P>
However, India and China continued leading the world in
consuming Coca-Cola. Unit case volume jumped 33 percent and 28
percent respectively in these two countries in the April-June
period.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Wants to Warm up Relations with Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan
Thursday received a message from his Kuwaiti counterpart saying
the emirate wants better bilateral relations seven years after the
break-up of diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
In his message, Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh
Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah expressed thanks for Jordan's recent
mediation effort for the release of Kuwaiti prisoners in Iraq,
calling it a good start for both sides to warm up relations.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate your concern to do every possible effort to
(help) release the Kuwaiti prisoners and detained hostages in
Iraqi jails," Al-Sabah said.
</P>
<P>
Continued efforts and positive developments between Jordan and
Kuwait will enhance bilateral ties and further speed up its
restoration, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said future cooperation between Kuwait and Jordan is an
inexorable trend and part of the cooperation among the whole Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
He said he agreed with the Jordanian regent that international
developments make it imperative "on all of us to build our region
anew, establish codes of conducts and work out plans to
consolidate cooperation and defend our competitive position in the
world."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is "fully ready to support and contribute to every
genuine effort geared to realize these Pan-Arab noble objectives
and reconstruct the joint Arab action on solid ambitions and
individual inclinations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait froze ties with Jordan after accusing it of supporting
Iraq during the latter's seven-month occupation of the emirate
between August 1990 and February 1991.
</P>
<P>
At the height of the crisis, Kuwait dismissed over 320,000
Jordanians from their jobs, closed the Jordanian Embassy and
recalled its ambassador from Amman.
</P>
<P>
The ice in Jordanian-Kuwaiti ties began to thaw in July 1997,
when both sides resumed commercial flights between their capital
cities.
</P>
<P>
The ties turned for the better in April this year, when Kuwait
released 13 Jordanian prisoners jailed since 1991 for allegedly
collaborating with Iraq during the Gulf war.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Flooding in Bangladesh has
aggravated as water levels in major rivers rose and onrush hilly
waters and incessant rains engulfed more areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The flood situation may experience further deterioration
following a general rising trend of water levels in the major
rivers and significant rainfall in the upstream," the Flood
Forecasting and Warning Center said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Millions of people have been affected and vast areas of
standing crops have been washed away in many parts of the country,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
At least 22 people have been killed in the monsoon flooding in
the country, they said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has expressed her deep concern at
the plight of flood-hit people and directed district
administrations to take all necessary measures to mitigate their
sufferings.
</P>
<P>
She asked district administrations to work out necessary
preparedness plans for evacuation of the flood-affected people and
cattle and for undertaking relief operations in the affected
areas.
</P>
<P>
The Disaster Management and Relief Ministry has sanctioned
grants for flood-stricken districts as relief. It has provided 350
tons of rice for some districts. In the southeastern Bandarban
hill district, the local administration has allocated 9.5 tons of
rice as emergency relief for flood-affected people.
</P>
<P>
More than 2 million people have been reportedly affected and
over 1 million acres of crops have been damaged by floods in
Bangladesh since the monsoon season began in July. The extent of
damage by the floods, however, is yet to be ascertained, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
There are frequent heavy rains in the monsoon season (from July
to October) in the South Asian nation.

<HEADLINE> Malawi's Tobacco to Bring in Dismal Earning: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Malawi's major foreign exchange
earner, tobacco, is estimated to bring in a dismal 6.7 billion
Kwacha (268 million US Dollars) this year, representing a 27
percent drop over last year's earnings.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco Control Commission (TCC) General Manager Godfrey
Chapola told the daily Times newspaper in Blantyre, the Malawi
News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"If the trend in prices is the same to the end of the
auctioning season, we estimate that 180 million US Dollars will
be realized from tobacco this year," said Chapola.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Malawi made 249 million Dollars from tobacco sales.
</P>
<P>
According to the tobacco commission chief, high production
costs such as a rise in fertilizer prices, has largely caused the
drop in the production of high fetching burley and flue cured
tobaccos.
</P>
<P>
"Thirteen percent of tobacco estate growers did not grow
burley this year while a number of them have now opted to become
intermediate buyers," he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 113 million kilograms of tobacco is estimated to be
realized this year as opposed to 158 million kilograms in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Of the estimates, Chapola said Malawi's southern region is
expected to produce 16 million kilograms of burley tobacco,
representing a drop of 27 percent from the 1997 yield.
</P>
<P>
The central region is anticipated to produce 73 million
kilograms of burley against 98 million for last year. Northern
region which is the largest producer will yield 112 million
kilograms of burley as opposed to 134 million in 1997, with a
16-percent drop.
</P>
<P>
Of the flue cured tobacco, Chapola said, the southern region
which produced 3.98 million kilograms in 1997 is now expected to
produce 2.5 million kilograms. Central region will produce 7.5
million kilograms against the 9.1 million kilograms last year.
</P>
<P>
However, only the northern region will produce more flue cured
tobacco this year (2 million kilograms) than last year's 1.8
million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Malawi is divided into three regions, namely southern, central
and northern regions.
</P>
<P>
As of July 2, Chapola said the average for burley at the
auction floors was 129 U.S. cents per kilogram while last year's
average price during the same period was 168 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Flue cured tobacco fetched 158 U.S. cents per kilogram as of
July 2 this year as compared to 180 cents in the same period in
1997. Due to the same dismal pricing, there has been an outcry
by many farmers especially small-scale producers who feel cheated
and would reap nothing in terms of profits as every cent realized
would go to payment of input loans.
</P>
<P>
Another contributing factor to the poor prices, according to
Chapola, is that much of the tobacco was damaged by the heavy
rains in the 1997/98 growing season.
</P>
<P>
"This also affected the quality of crop," lamented the tobacco
chief.
</P>
<P>
Some economic analysts feel it is high time Malawi shifted its
total dependence on tobacco for foreign exchange to other equally
profiting ventures especially in view of the escalating
anti-tobacco lobby internationally.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Vision Uganda, a
non-governmental organization, is trying to bring the abducted
children in north Uganda to limelight and has appealed to
Ugandans and the world community to help the traumatized young
people.
</P>
<P>
Kofi Hagan, the country director of World Vision Uganda, told
a press conference here Thursday afternoon that his organization
has two centers in north Uganda whose duties are to help restore
hope in the children of reuniting with their communities.
</P>
<P>
He said some 4,000 to 6,000 children ranging from 10 to 20
years of age have been abducted by the rebels of the Lord's
Resistance Army since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Once abducted, the children would be forced to carry loads too
heavy for their backs, to be trained to kill and some of the
girls were given out to rebel commanders as rewards, he revealed.
</P>
<P>
Their center in Gulu district, set up in March 1995, has
offered skills training and psychological therapy to more than
3,500 children.
</P>
<P>
The center is facilitated by social workers, counselors,
health specialists, and vocational skills trainers.
</P>
<P>
"Many of them have lost so many years of education that it is
difficult for them to go back to school again and therefore
acquisition of basic skills prove very useful," he told
reporters.

<HEADLINE> Malawi's Tobacco to Bring in Dismal Earning: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Malawi's major foreign exchange
earner, tobacco, is estimated to bring in a dismal 6.7 billion
Kwacha (268 million US Dollars) this year, representing a 27
percent drop over last year's earnings.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco Control Commission (TCC) General Manager Godfrey
Chapola told the daily Times newspaper in Blantyre, the Malawi
News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"If the trend in prices is the same to the end of the
auctioning season, we estimate that 180 million US Dollars will
be realized from tobacco this year," said Chapola.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Malawi made 249 million Dollars from tobacco sales.
</P>
<P>
According to the tobacco commission chief, high production
costs such as a rise in fertilizer prices, has largely caused the
drop in the production of high fetching burley and flue cured
tobaccos.
</P>
<P>
"Thirteen percent of tobacco estate growers did not grow
burley this year while a number of them have now opted to become
intermediate buyers," he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 113 million kilograms of tobacco is estimated to be
realized this year as opposed to 158 million kilograms in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Of the estimates, Chapola said Malawi's southern region is
expected to produce 16 million kilograms of burley tobacco,
representing a drop of 27 percent from the 1997 yield.
</P>
<P>
The central region is anticipated to produce 73 million
kilograms of burley against 98 million for last year. Northern
region which is the largest producer will yield 112 million
kilograms of burley as opposed to 134 million in 1997, with a
16-percent drop.
</P>
<P>
Of the flue cured tobacco, Chapola said, the southern region
which produced 3.98 million kilograms in 1997 is now expected to
produce 2.5 million kilograms. Central region will produce 7.5
million kilograms against the 9.1 million kilograms last year.
</P>
<P>
However, only the northern region will produce more flue cured
tobacco this year (2 million kilograms) than last year's 1.8
million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Malawi is divided into three regions, namely southern, central
and northern regions.
</P>
<P>
As of July 2, Chapola said the average for burley at the
auction floors was 129 U.S. cents per kilogram while last year's
average price during the same period was 168 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Flue cured tobacco fetched 158 U.S. cents per kilogram as of
July 2 this year as compared to 180 cents in the same period in
1997. Due to the same dismal pricing, there has been an outcry
by many farmers especially small-scale producers who feel cheated
and would reap nothing in terms of profits as every cent realized
would go to payment of input loans.
</P>
<P>
Another contributing factor to the poor prices, according to
Chapola, is that much of the tobacco was damaged by the heavy
rains in the 1997/98 growing season.
</P>
<P>
"This also affected the quality of crop," lamented the tobacco
chief.
</P>
<P>
Some economic analysts feel it is high time Malawi shifted its
total dependence on tobacco for foreign exchange to other equally
profiting ventures especially in view of the escalating
anti-tobacco lobby internationally.

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Urged to Help Abducted Children Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Vision Uganda, a
non-governmental organization, is trying to bring the abducted
children in north Uganda to limelight and has appealed to
Ugandans and the world community to help the traumatized young
people.
</P>
<P>
Kofi Hagan, the country director of World Vision Uganda, told
a press conference here Thursday afternoon that his organization
has two centers in north Uganda whose duties are to help restore
hope in the children of reuniting with their communities.
</P>
<P>
He said some 4,000 to 6,000 children ranging from 10 to 20
years of age have been abducted by the rebels of the Lord's
Resistance Army since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Once abducted, the children would be forced to carry loads too
heavy for their backs, to be trained to kill and some of the
girls were given out to rebel commanders as rewards, he revealed.
</P>
<P>
Their center in Gulu district, set up in March 1995, has
offered skills training and psychological therapy to more than
3,500 children.
</P>
<P>
The center is facilitated by social workers, counselors,
health specialists, and vocational skills trainers.
</P>
<P>
"Many of them have lost so many years of education that it is
difficult for them to go back to school again and therefore
acquisition of basic skills prove very useful," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He called on all people to try to end the war in the country
so that people can be developed into productive force for the
society.
</P>
<P>
"Without the cessation of the war, there will be no end to the
abductions," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Butros-Ghali: Superpowers Weakens U.N. Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Former United Nations Secretary
General Butros Butros-Ghali here Thursday accused "superpowers" of
having wielded too much influence which in effect made the world
body impotent to implement all its resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"Political reasons imposed by world superpowers are behind the
double standard policy of the U.N. in implementing some of its
resolutions," he said at a program organized by the U.N.
International Leadership Academy in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Some of the U.N.'s decisions were implemented while others are
not, he said. For example, the U.N. insists on implementing its
resolutions on Iraq, meanwhile such insistency has never been
exerted on the decision related to Israel's withdrawal from
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"This confirms the superpowers' influence on the organization
whether the world body itself is serious in implementing its
decisions or not," he added.
</P>
<P>
Instead of naming the "superpowers," Butros-Ghali "There is
major dependence on the United States to resolve the Middle East
crisis and the European role will not be decisive but rather a
supporter to that of the U.S.."
</P>
<P>
The former U.N. chief noted that the current situation in the
U.N. is harming its image and damaging its function. "Many
countries no longer believe in the role of the world body and that
is why they are lukewarm to meet their financial obligations," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Butros-Ghali, who had been an Egyptian politician before
becoming U.N. chief in 1992 for a four-year tenure, is now
secretary general of the Francophonie.

<HEADLINE> WTO Launches New Director-General Nomination Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (WTO)
has formally launched the process for the nomination of its next
director-general, said a WTO spokesman here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent WTO chief Renato Ruggiero has said in a letter to
the General Council that he intends to leave office not later than
April 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The WTO members, which wish to nominate candidates for the
position of the WTO director-general, should submit the names to
the chairman of the General Council by October 1 at the latest,
WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The new director-general will be selected from the candidates
by consensus by the end of November and will be confirmed at the
December meeting of the General Council.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to emphasize that members will appoint the new
director-general on the basis of consensus," said John Weekes,
chairman of the General Council at its Wednesday meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I would urge members to bear this important reality in mind
over the coming months," Weekes said. "We are not planning an
election campaign; there will be no vote. We need to operate in a
way which will facilitate consensus, rather than make it more
difficult."
</P>
<P>
No formal nominations have been submitted yet but trade sources
say that there are at least five potential candidates. They are
Brazil's foreign minister Felipe Luiz Lampreia, former Canadian
trade minister Roy MacLaren, former Moroccan trade minister Hassan
Abouyoub, former New Zealand premier Mike Moore, and Thai deputy
prime minister Supachai Panitchpakdi.

<HEADLINE> China Backs International Conference on Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- China backs the Egyptian-French
initiative to hold an international conference to rescue the
Middle East peace process, Chinese Ambassador to Egypt Yang
Fuchang said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Middle East News Agency Thursday quoted Yang as saying
in an interview that China's support to the Palestinians and their
cause is firm and will never be changed.
</P>
<P>
During Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to
Beijing at the end of May, Chinese leaders urged him to carry out
the commitments made in the signed peace accords and
unconditionally accept the U.N. Resolution 425 calling for an
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the Mideast peace process is facing a collapse
due to Israel's intransigence.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been stalled for about 16
months, while a number of countries are discussing the idea to
hold an international conference on the peace process as jointly
proposed by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and his French
counterpart Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Praising the healthy development of the Egyptian-Chinese trade
relations, the Chinese ambassador said the level of trade exchange
rose to 520 million U.S. dollars last year, of which 50 million
dollars were in Egyptian exports.
</P>
<P>
He said both countries are now looking into the establishment
of an economic and industrial zone in East Suez. China will invest
7 million dollars in the zone, he added.

</P>
<P>
During his trip, the NATO chief will examine the military
training center at Krivolak which NATO has planned to turn into a
base should the need arise for the western military alliance to
deploy what it has called preventive forces in the region.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia has offered the Krivolak center as a permanent
training center for the NATO's Partnership for Peace programs.
</P>
<P>

from August 17 to 22.
</P>

BRUSSELS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Any alcoholic beverage that

The European Court of Justice ruled on Thursday that such
alcoholic beverage with less than 40 percent alcohol content is

ATHENS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A subregional headquarters of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Larissa, central
Greece, will begin operation on October 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Greece's first army corps leadership announced Thursday that

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans to Extend Helms-Burton Waiver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
planned to sign papers authorizing a renewal of the waiver for
another six months of the Helms-Burton law that requires the
United States to penalize foreign firms investing in Cuba, the
White House said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton would sign the papers
later on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It will be the second time that Clinton is going to waive the
sanctions since he signed the legislation into law in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton law has enraged U.S. allies in Europe and
Canada. they accused Washington of pursuing extraterritoriality
by penalizing foreign companies that invest in Cuban property
seized after the 1959 Cuban revolution and vowed to retaliate if
the United States enforce the law against their companies
investing in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Even Clinton has complained about the rigid law despite the
fact that he has signed it, saying it constrained his ability to
conduct foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The ground work for the latest waiver came in an agreement
reached in May between U.S. and European negotiators. The
European Union agreed to adopt certain "disciplines" to inhibit
and deter investments by its businessmen in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Clinton himself has worked to improve some contacts with
Cuba, allowing Cuban families in America to send more money back
home to relatives and easing restrictions on charter flights.

<HEADLINE> Former Hardline Minister Makes Surprise Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Former hardline Interior Minister
Charles Pasqua Thursday made surprise remarks on immigration, one of
the most sensitive issues in the country, by suggesting that all
illegal immigrants be given residency in France.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Le Monde, Pasqua, who was the
designer of the 1993 conservative immigration law which virtually
closed door to immigrants, said that when France is strong as it is
now, it should be generous to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
"One cannot go out unless regularizing all the people who ask
for it, except those who have committed another offense," he said.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the government for holding a paradoxical attitude
toward immigration, as it has failed to tackle the problem of
immigration while claiming that France is capable of integrating
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Pasqua, who is a senator from the Gaullist Rally for the Republic
(RPR), also suggested that France continue to have full control over
its frontiers instead of handing over the power to the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
"Control, that is to say not to let Brussels decide on behalf of
us, as the Amsterdam treaty predicts. That also implies negotiating
with the countries of origin (of immigrants)," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Amsterdam Treaty calls for the opening of frontiers between
the European Union countries to allow free circulation of people.
</P>
<P>
He relaunched his idea for establishing a quota system of
admitting immigrants from the former colonies of France, giving them
priority in immigrant's status.

<HEADLINE> Continued War Mars Image of Uganda: Dutch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Charge D'Affaires of Dutch
Embassy to Uganda Mrs Saskia de Lang said here Thursday afternoon
that the continued rebel war in north Uganda has marred the image
of Uganda abroad and hampered its development.
</P>
<P>
She made these remarks when launching a book Restored Hope by
Robby Muhumuza of the World Vision, a non-governmental
organization which mainly focuses its attention in Uganda on
checking the spread of AIDS and detraumatizing the former
abducted young people in the north.
</P>
<P>
The book contains testimonies of 11 former abducted children
undergoing counseling in humanitarian centers in the norther part
of this east African country.
</P>
<P>
The war there and the abductions have affected Uganda's
attractiveness to foreign investors and put a strain on the
social resources which would otherwise have been useful to the
country, the Dutch diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
The continued and rising insecurity in the region is hampering
the development of Uganda because it scares investors away, she
added.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, some 4,000 to 6,000 children of 10 to 20 years of
age have been abducted by the rebels of the Lord Resistance Army.
They have been forced to kill and damage.
</P>
<P>
She pledged that her government will continue to provide
various kinds of help to the World Vision.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Netherlands contributed a total of 35,000 U.S.
Dollars to boost the development of Uganda.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Head of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) Renato Ruggiero has promised that his
organization will make every effort to improve the public
understanding of its role, said his spokesman Keith Rockwell here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a speech on Wednesday responding to the United States'
proposal to increase the organization's transparency, Ruggiero
urged the General Council of the WTO to do more to promote
transparency and dispel the misleading impression of secrecy.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that no real progress will be made to improve the
exchange of information about the nature and goals of the WTO
unless there is a strong commitment from the governments of its
members.
</P>
<P>
In a proposal to the WTO General Council Wednesday, the United
States complained that the minutes of General Council meetings
generally come out only a month after the events, and even then
they are marked "restricted" and may remain unavailable to the
press and general public for as long as six months.
</P>
<P>
The same problem exists with panel reports, leading to
different interpretations by interested parties who would claim
victory by quoting parts of the reports, said Ms Rita Hayes, U.S.
permanent representative to the WTO,
</P>
<P>
She hoped that the General Council will move to adopt the U.S.
proposal immediately.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program has earmarked 31.5 million U.S. Dollars to help feed
returning refugees and displaced persons in Sierra Leone, a
report from Freetown said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the state radio as saying that the package
was part of an agreement signed Wednesday in the Sierra Leonean
capital.
</P>
<P>
It aims to feed 452,840 people by providing 46,359 tons of
food, including soya beans, cereals and oil, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Relief officials in Freetown estimated that over a million
people, or a quarter of the Sierra Leonean population, fled
abroad or were displaced during the West African country's seven
years of political unrest since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The figure shot up after the coup in May 1997 that temporarily
ousted elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, who were restored to
power in March this year with the help of the West African
peace-keeping force ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has started repatriating refugees from Liberia,
Guinea and Gambia, but officials said plans for a mass
repatriation of some 500,000 refugees have been put on hold to
security concerns in the hinterland areas.

<HEADLINE> World Economic Growth Projected to Slow to 2.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- World economic growth is
expected to slow to 2.5 percent in 1998 after two straight years
of over 3 percent, the United Nations said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The after-effects of the Asian financial crisis has plunged
several of the fastest growing economies into a severe recession,
and highlighted dangerous weaknesses in the international market
for financial assets, said the 1998 edition of the U.N. World
Economic and Social Survey.
</P>
<P>
It said the forecast "is surrounded with an unusual degree of
uncertainty" as there is volatility in financial markets, coupled
with the slowdown in world trade and continued difficulties of
nations in defending their own currencies.
</P>
<P>
It said the developing countries are hardest hit in the crisis
and their growth this year might not exceed 3 percent after an
average of 5 percent or better in five of the six preceding years.
</P>
<P>
The industrialized economies are projected to grow by 2.25
percent, down from a decade-high of 2.7 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The economies in transition, which are emerging from severe
economic contraction in 1990-1996, are expected to grow by 3
percent or more this year, after 2.7 percent growth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Despite the economic difficulties in Asia, world trade is
forecast to grow about 7 percent down from an estimated 9 percent
in 1997 when a total of about 5.5 trillion U.S. dollars in
merchandise trade was reached, the survey said.

<HEADLINE> Chirac, Assad Hold Long Talks on Middle East Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac and
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad held two hours and a half of talks
Thursday afternoon at the Elysee presidential palace, which were
focused on the deadlock of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said that
during the talks, Chirac described the present situation in the
Middle East as being "close to a complete deadlock."
</P>
<P>
"France is determined not to let the peace process collapse
because that would be too dangerous a situation," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Chirac even suggested that one think in "a concrete way" what
the countries interested in peace should do in case of a total
failure of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Franco-Egyptian proposal to hold an
international conference on the Middle East was "a means to go out
of the present deadlock" and that its only purpose was to help
revive the peace process and "unify all the good wills."
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that the envisaged conference would reaffirm the
principles make up the foundation of the peace process -- the
validity of the agreements already signed between Israel and its
Arab neighbors and the obligation to apply the relevant United
Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
President Assad made little comments on the Franco-Egyptian
proposal and did not object to the idea, according to the French
presidential spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
The French president also discussed the situation of Lebanon
with Assad, including the application of the U.N. resolution 425,
which urges Israel to withdraw from Lebanon without condition.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Assad said there exists a long historical
relationship between Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Assad, who was on the first day of his first state visit in
France in 22 years, will be given a state dinner in his honor
Thursday evening by President Chirac at the Elysee palace.
</P>
<P>
When he arrived at the Orly airport, Assad was received by
Chirac in a rare high-level welcoming ceremony for a foreign head
of state in France.
</P>
<P>
Assad's visit to France is mainly aimed at seeking French
support in the complicated chessboard of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Syria risks to be isolated by the United States in the latter's
efforts to relaunch the Middle East peace process between Israel
and the Palestinians, because of Washington's suspicion about its
links with terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
Syria also faces some potential problems in its relations with
Lebanon, where it keeps 30,000 troops since 1990, because of
Israel's expected withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Assad will meet with French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on
Friday and will visit the Institute of the Monde Arabe in Paris.
France and Syria are also expected to sign some agreements on
cooperations in economic, cultural and scientific fields.

ANKARA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz will visit northern Cyprus next Monday to show Turkey's
support to the Turkish Cypriots who set up a breakaway republic
there.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day visit, Yilmaz will participate in a
celebration ceremony marking the 24th anniversary of Turkey's
military intervention in Cyprus and meet with Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash, Turkey's Anatolia News Agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz is also expected to discuss with Turkish Cypriot
officials the latest tension between the Greek and Turkish
communities in Cyprus, especially the Cypriot government's plan to
deploy Russian-made S-300 missiles on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops landed and took over the northern third of the island in
response to a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 the "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" which was only recognized by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
At present, around 35,000-strong Turkish troops are stationed
in northern Cyprus with a claimed aim to protect Turkish
Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Pan-African Environment Conference to Open in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Environment ministers from 53
African states will meet in Mozambique's capital Maputo from July
protection, the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the ministers' gathering, a series of workshops
attended by experts from all over Africa will be held on concrete
issues concerned between July 18 and 22, said the Nairobi-based
UNEP in a newsletter.
</P>
<P>
The Pan-African Conference on Sustainable Integrated Coastal
Management (PACSICOM) will provide a unique chance for the
continent to boost inter-governmental dialog on the rising
threats to the marine and coastal environment, UNEP claimed.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are expected to jointly issue resolutions, the
PACSICOM Statement, and the Maputo Declaration at the end of the
meeting to meet the complex challenges Africa is facing on
coastal management, according to the UNEP newsletter.
</P>
<P>
"The regional response to the environmental challenges facing
the African continent cannot be piecemeal. It must be conceived
and acted upon in an integrated and systematic way," said Klaus
Topfer, UNEP's Executive Director.
</P>
<P>
"PACSICOM brings together the combined political, scientific
and technical strength of Africa on matters relating to the state
of the continent's marine and coastal environment. This is a
unique opportunity for joint action," he said in the newsletter.
</P>
<P>
The conference comes at a time when global attention is being
especially paid to the marine environment throughout this year,
the Year of Ocean declared by the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is co-sponsored by the governments of Mozambique
and Finland, UNEP, as well as the U.N. Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).

<HEADLINE> Southern African Customs Union Finalizing Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Southern African Customs
Union (SACU) countries are finalizing their trade offer to the
larger Southern African Development Community (SADC) grouping as
the region moves toward setting up a single, stronger trade body.
</P>
<P>
So far, Namibia, Botswana and Lesotho have submitted lists of
"sensitive" products on which protection may be sought while
South Africa is still fine-tuning its list, South African Press
Association quoted a Namibian newspaper as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and South Africa make up
SACU and they also belong to 14-member SADC.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's provisional list of sensitive products included
fish, wines, spirits and red meat. Beef was understood to have
featured prominently on the lists of the sensitive products
already submitted by Namibia and others.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from all the five SACU member countries were
scheduled to meet at the weekend to clarify their joint trade
offer to SADC.
</P>
<P>
It is now envisaged that a SADC trade protocol will be fully
ratified before the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is reported to have expressed willingness to make
tariff reductions in an effort to facilitate the creation of a
regional free trade area.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a regional free trade area would threaten
the existence of SACU whose renegotiation has been on the drawing
board for the past four years.
</P>
<P>
The customs union's existence had also been threatened by
negotiations between South Africa and the European Union (EU) and
in particular by recent revelations that South Africa expressed
its willingness to tentatively remove barriers on a larger
percentage of EU imports coming into the country, a move feared
to hurt producers from the entire SACU.
</P>
<P>
SACU members draw a large portion of their total revenue from
the customs union pool. Over 30 percent of Namibia's annual
revenue is derived from the regional revenue pool.

<HEADLINE> Peace Not Possible in Middle East without Syria: Chirac </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Thursday defended Syria's place in the political geography of the
Middle East, claiming that peace is not possible in the region
without the involvement of Syria.
</P>
<P>
At a state dinner held at the Elysee presidential palace in
honor of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, Chirac also pleaded for
a "united and free Lebanon which has sovereignty over all its
territory."
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is being occupied by the Israeli troops in its south
and is hosting 30,000 Syrian troops who are there in the name of
protecting the country against Israeli aggression.
</P>
<P>
Chirac vowed to work together with Syria for "a just, global
and lasting peace" in the Middle East, whose present situation he
described as being "close to complete deadlock."
</P>
<P>
He also called on Israel to return the Golan Heights -- annexed
by Israel but claimed by Syria -- to Syrian sovereignty, and said
that the principle of land for peace is the basis of the French
position for a long time.
</P>
<P>
"Peace for land with the return of Golan to Syria. Peace for
land with the pursuit of the Israeli redeployment and the
transfers of power in the Palestinian territories, in conformity
with the agreements signed," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He said that Lebanon is "dear" to France, which he said wants
to see Lebanon go ahead on the way of "reconciliation,
reconstruction, democracy and liberty."
</P>
<P>
Chirac also said that Israel should be entitled to "full and
entire" security, maintain its internationally recognized
frontiers, and enjoy peaceful relations with its neighbors once it
has returned the conquered Arab territories.

MANILA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said here Thursday that he has ordered Finance Secretary Edgardo
Espiritu to submit all the documents pertaining to alleged behest
loans incurred during the Fidel Ramos administration.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said Espiritu was set to submit to the Presidential
Palace the loan records, adding that his government would make
appropriate conclusions after the documents are examined.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Espiritu reported to Estrada that big corporations
well connected with former president Ramos were able to avail of
loans from the Development Bank of the Philippines which were
supposedly intended for small and medium-scale enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Finance has started investigating the alleged
behest loans and unliquidated cash advances amounting to billions
of pesos to Ramos' "cronies".
</P>
<P>
Because of the bank records uncovered by Espiritu, Estrada
ordered a thorough audit of financial statements and other bank
records of government financial institutions to detect possible
misuse of public funds.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said that
the audit shall also cover a review of all transactions by
government financial institutions and government-owned or
controlled corporations during the Ramos administration.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said he and Espiritu believed that the loans should have
been extended to small and medium-scale enterprises to encourage
investments in the countryside and balance the economic
development of the country.
</P>
<P>
Zamora explained that the questionable loans were uncovered in
the course of the review being done by the Department of Finance
on the country's true financial state, in preparation for the
drafting of the 1999 national budget.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Need for Coordinated Relief Efforts in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Economic and
Social Council Thursday held a panel discussion on natural
disasters with United Nations resident and humanitarian
coordinators.
</P>
<P>
Speakers cited lessons learned form Afghanistan earthquakes,
forest fires in Indonesia and EL Nino floods in Peru to emphasize
the coordinated relief efforts in natural disaster situations.
</P>
<P>
Lack of preparedness and coordination could contribute to the
human toll in a natural catastrophe, United Nations Humanitarian
Coordinator for Afghanistan Alfred Witschi-Cestari said.
</P>
<P>
If the international community was not prepared for a natural
event, there would be a human drama, he said, adding that in
Afghanistan, the international community had to overcome
tremendous difficulties in order to reach the affected population,
but coordination had been established almost immediately after the
facts were made clear.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Resident Coordinator for Indonesia Ravi Rajan
described the emergency response to the extensive forest fires
that burned in the country in the past year.
</P>
<P>
He said the support of the government and the international
community facilitated the effective coordination of the response
to the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Yet, he said, the scope and extent of the disaster was such
that the combined efforts of all actors were not adequate to deal
with it fully, and vulnerability to such disasters would only
increase in the future and thus the elaboration of prevention and
preparedness strategies were necessary.
</P>
<P>
Addressing recent floods in Peru, the country's United Nations
Resident Coordinator Kim Bolduc, said that the 1997-1998
phenomenon was considered as a El Nino.
</P>
<P>
He said El Nino was a typical natural disaster due to its four
to six months' duration, and other natural disasters tended to be
violent, but shorter in length.
</P>
<P>
He said that in preparation for its arrival, the Peruvian
government had started prevention activities in early 1997, but
the country still suffered enormous losses, and 600,000 people
were directly affected, and future El Nino would be stronger and
more devastating each time.

<HEADLINE> Greece Reaffirms Support for Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos Friday reiterated Greece's support for Cyprus in
efforts to find a just, viable and feasible solution to the
problems of the island republic which has been divided since 1974.
</P>
<P>
In a message on the 24th anniversary of the Turkish invasion
and occupation of one-third of Cyprus, Stephanopoulos said that it
was their duty to support these efforts which would also be a
tribute to the memory of all those who gave up their lives for the
independence and unity of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since July 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are about 35,000 Turkish troops stationed in
northern Cyprus which declared its independence in 1983 but was
recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Greek president urged Turkey to withdraw its troops from
northern Cyprus so that "all Cypriots, irrespective of ethnic
origin or religion, can march together down the road of
conciliation and creation, within the framework of a bizonal,
bicommunal federation."
</P>
<P>
Stephanopoulos added that it would open a new page in the
centuries-long peaceful co-existence of the two communities in
Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Orders FAZ to Pay Former Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- FIFA has insisted on its earlier
decision that the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) must pay
its former national coach Burkhard Ziese 127,945.70 U.S. Dollars
within 30 days for breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
FIFA made the ruling last week after throwing out an appeal
lodged by FAZ contesting an earlier FIFA decision to compensate
Ziese, said James Mazumba, FAZ's general secretary on Thursday,
the Times of Zambia reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
FIFA said FAZ's appeal was lodged in a few days late and
therefor could not be heard.
</P>
<P>
The world soccer body stated that a match defeat is not
sufficient ground to dismiss a coach and that FAZ is liable for
payment of the sum of money claimed by Ziese within the period of
30 days.
</P>
<P>
Ziese, a German-born soccer coach, was fired after Zambian was
routed 0-4 by Egypt in the Cup of Africa Nations finals last
February in Burkina Fasso.
</P>
<P>
He was sacked four months after signing a two-year contract
with FAZ on December 20, 1997 at a salary of 15,000 Dollars per
month. Under the contact, he is entitled to six months' salary if
his services are terminated by FAZ.
</P>
<P>
In a letter written to FIFA after his dismissal, besides the
compensation, Ziese also claimed a refund of 37,945.70 dollars
which he spent on the national team when they camped in Gambia
preparing for the CAN matches, bringing the total to 127,945.70
Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM Defends Government Economic Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong Friday urged companies not to pin their hopes on the
government to salvage them out of the current economic
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner Friday evening to mark the 30th
anniversary of the Development Bank of Singapore, one of the four
biggest banks in the island-country, Goh said the market must be
the driving force rather than the government.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his agreement with a recent research report that
says the government "can ease the pain as the economy contracts
but it can not stop the contraction in any meaningful way."
</P>
<P>
"when faced with an external shock, the correct policy is to
allow prices and asset-values to adjust to the new realities," he
said, adding that Singapore's problem is a fall in regional demand
and a slowing of the electronic cycle in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
"Both of which we can do nothing about," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was responding to some complaints by some
businessmen over government inactiveness to cope with the current
economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
Some businessmen have expressed disappointment at the
2-billion-Singapore-dollar package measures announced by the
government at the end of June to boost the downturning economy.
</P>
<P>
They complained that nothing was being done to stimulate demand
and urged the government to act now to arrest the decline in
economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
Some others urged the government to pay more attention to the
property market and suggested that government-linked companies
soak up the excess supply in the property market.
</P>
<P>
Goh said "businessmen should know that unwarranted negative
reaction to the government's management of the economic crisis
without offering any serious suggestions to overcome the crisis is
like biting one's own tail."
</P>
<P>
"Being critical without sound basis, not only do they confuse
the public, they also affect the psychology of the population and
undermine market confidence in the very measures designed to help
them weather the crisis," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said anyone who suggests that the government-linked
companies go in to prop up the market by paying more than what the
properties are worth is asking the government to bail them out.
</P>
<P>
The government will not do that, either directly or indirectly
through the government-linked companies, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He asked the businessmen to have faith in the government
leadership in tackling the challenges created by the regional
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Lauds Economic Cooperation With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait and China enjoy mutually
beneficial economies and vast potential for economic cooperation,
according to Abdulmohsen Al-Jeaan, ambassador of the State of
Kuwait to China.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said today that an open Kuwaiti market provides
an ideal point for absorbing China's high quality and high-tech
products. He added that China's constantly improved investment
environment will become even more attractive to Kuwaiti investors
</P>
<P>
Jeaan pointed out two types of economic cooperation between
Kuwait and China. He cited the first as the development assistance
projects signed between the two governments. For example, Kuwait
has provided soft loans totalling 10 miilion Dinars (34 million US
dollars) for the Integrated Rural Development Project in Northwest
China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the largest Sino-Kuwaiti
project of its type to date.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the second form of economic cooperation as
investment projects and noted that the Kuwaiti government
encourages businessmen to invest in China. For example, Kuwaiti
businessmen have invested in 22 projects in China since August
1982, with total investments standing at 152.3 million Dinars,
according to the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China has also contracted a number of
construction projects in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The foreign trade volume between the two countries for the
first five months of this year stood at 101 million US dollars, up
29 percent on the previous year's period, according to the Kuwaiti
embassy. China's export to Kuwait stood at 48.4 million US
dollars.

Unions today called on trade unions across the nation to help
laid-off workers find new jobs and ensure basic living standards.
</P>

Zhang called on trade union officials to exhibit great care and
help laid-off workers solve difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that effective measures must be adopted to develop
vocational training and improve employment services.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions should closely monitor reemployment service
centers, in addition to providing living allowance and paying
old-age pension, unemployment and medical insurance for laid-off
workers, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He added that trade unions should also help guarantee the
implementation of the central government policies concerning
laid-off workers.

<HEADLINE> Top Israeli-Palestinian Meeting Due Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai will meet senior Palestinian official Mahmoud Abbas (Abu
Mazen) Sunday in Tel Aviv to resume direct talks, Israel Radio
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) refused to confirm
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli Defense Ministry spokesman confirmed that the
meeting was agreed upon in the wake of contacts between Israel,
the United States and the PNA.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the PNA has rejected Israel's request that
PNA President Yasser Arafat meet with Mordechai. But Israeli
sources were quoted as saying that Abu Mazen, Arafat's deputy, has
the power to take decisions on behalf of Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, however, refused to
confirm the reported meeting, saying that it would be decided
only at the PNA Cabinet meeting this weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Mordechai-Mazen meeting was believed to be the result of
the intervenation by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
who said no progress in reviving the stalled peace process would
be possible without direct talks.
</P>
<P>
Albright's call for direct talks came after the U.S. had failed
to persuade Israel to accept its proposal for a 13.1 percent
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Washington has become increasingly impatient with the
protracted deadlock in the peace talks which broke down 16 months
ago when Israel began building a Jewish settlement in the Arab
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai has reportedly been authorized by Israel's powerful
Inner Cabinet to limit his talks on only two issues -- the
cancellation of the clauses in the Palestinian Covenant calling
for Israel's destruction and the scope of the Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
As far as the withdrawal was concerned, Mordechai was asked
to discuss the nature of the newly-proposed Area D, which is among
the 13.1 percent areas due to be handed over to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel's plan, the Israeli army would retain the
right to re-enter Area D for security reasons after the withdrawal
and the Palestinians would also be barred from building in such
areas.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the PNA is completely controlling 3 percent of the
West Bank, called Area A, and sharing control with Israel over 24
percent of West Bank, called Area B. But Israel retains control
over the rest of the West Bank, or 70 percent, which was
designated as Area C.

<HEADLINE> Blair Attacks "Separatist" Party in Scotland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
on Friday attacked the Scottish National Party (SNP).
</P>
<P>
Awaring rising tendency of independence in Scotland, Blair
flied to Edingburge on Friday for a one-day visit to drum up
support for Labor Party's management in the area.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll put the SNP 14 percentage points ahead of Labor
in voting intentions for the new Edinburgh parliament.
</P>
<P>
It was in stark contrast to polls conducted across Britain
which give Labor a massive lead of over 20 points over the
opposition Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Speaking ahead of meeting potential Labor candidates for next
year's Scottish parliamentary elections, Blair predicted that SNP
support would fall before voters go to the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
It was "absurd" that Scotland's interests would be served by
becoming independent, Blair told reporters in the Scottish
capital.
</P>
<P>
The SNP's strong showing in recent polls has raised the
question whether Labor can retain its dominance in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The government is setting up parliaments in Edinburgh and
Cardiff so that the people of Scotland and Wales can run their own
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The SNP says that if it emerges as the largest party in the new
129-seat Edinburgh Parliament, it will insist on a referendum on
independence within the first four-year term.
</P>
<P>
According to the polls, a plebiscite could result in a majority
in favor of breaking the link with England which dated from 1707.

<HEADLINE> Taihu Lake Witnesses Improved Water Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The water quality in east China's
Taihu Lake has improved significantly during the first half of
this year, according to information released during today's
conference on pollution control in the area.
</P>
<P>
The achievements can be attributed to a two-year local
government effort to increase rainfall, according to Xie Zhenhua,
director of the State Environmental Protection Administration.
</P>
<P>
However, Xie noted that the status quo continues to lag far
behind demands of the State Council, and great difficulty remains
in overcoming related problems and ensuring that all sources of
pollution in the area meet emission standards by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
"We must not relax our efforts," said Xie.
</P>
<P>
Some 670-odd small plants creating serious pollution in the
Taihu Lake area have been forced to close since 1996, with 42.1
percent, or over 1,000 major polluters in the region, fulfilling
emission standards by the end of June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Five new urban sewage treatment plants have a total daily
handling capacity of 580,000 tons of wastewater, and a sixth plant
is under construction.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have also expanded efforts to control
silting, dredge rivers, protecting drinking water resources and
control fish farming and shipping-related pollution in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Taihu Lake region, one of China's most developed regions,
covers 36,000 sq.km in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and
Shanghai.

efforts to join the regional bloc.
</P>
<P>
European Commissioner for External Affairs Hans van den Broek

<HEADLINE> Russia Buries Remains of Last Tsar, Dependants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday buried the remains
of its last tsar and his dependants, exactly 80 years after they
were executed by Bolsheviks.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and his wife Naina, both dressed in black, attended the
service at Peter and Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg, the former
imperial capital.
</P>
<P>
Upon Yeltsin's announcement on Thursday that he would join the
ceremony, Communist deputies condemned his decision, saying the
tsar was a brutal autocrat and that the president's attendance
would divide society.
</P>
<P>
As clergy from the Russian Orthodox church sang a mournful
dirge and bells rang, workers lowered the coffins holding the
royal bones into crypts in the church.
</P>
<P>
The nine small coffins contained the bones of Nicholas II, his
wife, three of their children, three servants and the family
doctor.
</P>
<P>
In February, a government commission ruled after seven years of
research that the remains, found in 1991 near the city of
Yekaterinburg, where the royal family members were executed,
belonged to Nicholas and his family.
</P>
<P>
The government decided that the remains should be reburied in
Peter and Paul Cathedral, the resting place of Russian emperors
since Peter the Great, who died in 1725.
</P>
<P>
DNA tests conducted in Russia and abroad confirmed the identity
of the remains to a 99.9 percent degree of certainty but the
Orthodox Church Abroad, which split off after the revolution,
claims the real remains are in a church in Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Four South Asian Countries Reaffirm Sub-Regional  Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Foreign secretaries of
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal reaffirmed here Friday their
commitment to pursuing sub-regional economic cooperation to
accelerate economic growth, overcome infrastructure constraints
and develop and make the optimal use of complementarities.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretaries are meeting here for the second time to
consider the working modalities of the sub-regional Growth
Quadrangle, initiated by Nepal in December 1996 with a view to
jointly developing the eastern Himalayan rivers for rapid economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The Growth Quadrangle comprises Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretaries decided that the Growth Quadrangle will
be pursued within the framework of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) with the objective of complementing
and supplementing regional cooperation, the Nepali Foreign
Ministry said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
They reiterated their decision at the first meeting held here
in April last year and decided to assign Bhutan the coordinating
responsibilities in the area of environment, Bangladesh in the
area of optimal and sustainable utilization of natural resources
and energy, India trade and investment facilitation and promotion
and Nepal multimodal transportation and communication and tourism.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to constitute working groups to examine and
recommend specific projects for sub-regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In making proposals, the working groups will be guided by the
principles of maximum coordination and a building block approach.
</P>
<P>
And the proposals will be submitted to a steering committee
consisting of foreign secretaries of the four countries for
consideration, the Nepali Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretaries agreed that the meeting of the working
groups on sectoral areas would be held soon in order to give
further impetus to the objectives of the Growth Quadrangle, the
ministry added.
</P>
<P>
SAARC was formed in December 1985 to promote regional
cooperation in agreed areas among its member countries --
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
At the 9th summit held in May 1997 in the Maldives, SAARC
leaders encouraged the development of specific projects relevant
to the specific individual needs of three or more member
countries.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Study of Deng Xiaoping Theory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, general secretary of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said
today that further studies of Deng Xiaoping Theory must be carried
out in line with the study of the guidelines of the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Related studies will enable people to gain a comprehensive and
correct understanding of Deng Xiaoping Theory and wholeheartedly
proceed with the cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics in the 21st century, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks during a speech to a work conference on
the study of Deng Xiaoping Theory which began in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
He said that Deng Xiaoping Theory enabled China to record
remarkable achievements in reform and opening-up over the past two
decades, and fulfillment of the tasks set forth at the 15th
National Party Congress must rely on the guidance from the theory.
</P>
<P>
Facts have shown that the new progress China has made in the
economic, political and cultural fields and diplomatic work as
well since the 15th National Party Congress resulted from the
earnest implementation of Deng Xiaoping Theory, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He said that qualified leaders must consistently study and
practice Deng Xiaoping Theory, stressing that it will otherwise be
impossible to correctly carry out Party policies since building
socialism with Chinese characteristics is an unprecedented
undertaking.
</P>
<P>
He stressed people must study the theory in their spare time,
and must never be satisfied with a minimal understanding or
otherwise engage in formalism, which might in any way damage the
Party or the country.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials at all levels must assume full responsibility
for organizing study groups and providing people, leading
officials in particular, with a full understanding of Deng
Xiaoping Theory, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The media in Beijing has answered Jiang's call by making full
preparations to publicize Deng Xiaoping Theory, while the
Organization and Publicity Departments of the CPC Central Committee
has issued a circular calling for all Party members to study
Deng Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing, members of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee,
and other senior Party officials attended today's session of the

MANILA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
would pursue the peace initiatives of the previous administration
to try to forge a settlement with all rebel forces, Executive
Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said he is submitting to Estrada next week a list of
members of several government peace panels which would start peace
talks with the New People's Army (NPA), the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) and the extremists group, the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that the Estrada administration is
determined to pursue the peace process and we will begin the talks
possibly within a few weeks," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
NPA and MILF had been engaged in peace talks with the
government during the past few years, but the talks made little
progress in reaching any peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
In September 1996, the Moro National Liberation Front, the
largest rebel group in the country, signed a final peace pact with
the Fidel Ramos administration.
</P>
<P>
Estrada assumed the presidency on June 30 this year. Because of
the presidential elections in May and the change of government in
June, the government's peace talks with the rebel groups were

BRUSSELS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU), through
the executive European Commission, approved Friday an aid package
worth 1.15 million ECU, or 1.27 million U.S. dollars, for Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian package will help provide drinking water,
sanitation and basic food for people of Georgian origin but
displaced by conflict in the neighboring Abkazia.
</P>
<P>
The conflict, erupted in mid-May, was blamed for forcing
thousands of people to flee into Georgia, where some 30,000 of
them are being sheltered in the west of the country.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian aid will be managed by the European Community
Humanitarian Office and enable European organizations to carry out
emergency programs over the next six months.

<HEADLINE> US Trade Deficit Shoots Up to Record High in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit climbed
up to a record high of 15.75 billion U.S. dollars in May as the
lingering economic crisis in Asia brought U.S. exports down to the
lowest level in 15 months, the Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit for May was 10.3 percent higher than the
April imbalance of 14.27 billion dollars, indicating that the
fallout from Asia's currency crisis will be more severe for the
U.S. manufacturers and farmers than previous forecast.
</P>
<P>
For the first five months this year, the trade deficit is
running at a record annual rate of 156 billion dollars, 42 percent
higher than last year.
</P>
<P>
For May, the deficit with Japan narrowed by 8.5 percent to 4.95
billion dollars, the smallest imbalance since January. But for
the year, the deficit with Japan is running 18 percent above the
same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with newly industrialized countries in Asia, a
category that includes South Korea and other nations hard-hit by
the region's economic turmoil, totals 8 billion dollars for the
first five months this year, nearly a 20-fold increase from the
same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. deficit with the 15-nation European Union slipped to
1.67 billion dollars in May, down 49 percent from the April
deficit as imports of European cars and chemical products fell.
</P>
<P>
But the deficit with Mexico rose by 19 percent to 1.52 billion
dollars, the largest gap in a year.
</P>
<P>
The inflating deficit in May reflected a 1.2 percent drop in
U.S. exports of goods and services, which fell to 76.23 billion
dollars, the lowest level in 15 months.
</P>
<P>
Exports of the U.S. farm products declined by 113 million
dollars to 3.65 billion dollars, the lowest level since September
1994. Exports of telecommunications equipment fell 275 million
dollars to 1.89 billion dollars while exports of U.S. autos and
auto parts dropped 488 million dollars to 5.98 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's imports in May went up 0.5 percent to
91.98 billion dollars, the second highest level on record.
Imports of computers and computer parts rose 289 million dollars
to 5.6 billion dollars while imports of foreign cars and auto
parts were up 353 million dollars to 12.5 billion dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has outlined the causes leading to the European colonization of
Africa and hence the backwardness of the continent.
</P>
<P>
He made the analysis in a speech delivered Friday morning at
the closing ceremony of the first national congress of the ruling
National Resistance Movement.
</P>
<P>
The president said the lack of power, unity, science and
technology as well as small population are among the main factors
that result in the European colonization of the whole continent.
</P>
<P>
He gave special emphasis to the tribal system in the
continent, noting that it is this system that separated the
different ethnic groups and kept them from being united as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan were cited as examples of unity in front of
European enemies.
</P>
<P>
He called on all ethnic groups in Uganda to be united together
and progress together.
</P>
<P>
The five-day conference is the first of its kind in Ugandan
history. At the meeting, Museveni was elected unopposed the
chairperson of the Movement on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,554 representatives of the Movement from across

modernization and some other issues.

<HEADLINE> BHP Products Output Up in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Australia's leading company, the
Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP) Co. Ltd., said Friday its copper
concentrate and raw steel output recorded a two-digit increase in
June.
</P>
<P>
Copper concentrate production reached 58,900 tons in June, up
17 percent from the same period of 1997 and its total raw steel
production was 731,000 tons, 11 percent higher than that reported
for the same month last year, the company said in its monthly
production report.
</P>
<P>
Production and shipments of copper concentrate rose because of
the resumption of normal production at Ok Tedi copper mine in
Papua New Guinea following a period of unseasonably dry weather,
the diversified miner said.
</P>
<P>
Oil and condensate production rose 10 percent in June to 6.23
million barrels, compared to the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas production remained steady at 21.1 billion cubic
feet (594 million cubic meter) compared to the previous
corresponding 21.2 billion cubic feet (600 million cubic meter).
</P>
<P>
Iron ore production rose 4 percent to 4.50 million tons,
compared to the previous corresponding month's 4.33 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Production of manganese has dropped to 134,000 tons, compared
to 192,000 tons, due to a market downturn and some maintenance
work.
</P>
<P>
Ferroalloy production fell to 17,000 tons, compared to 20,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
Coal production was 1.799 million tons in June, marginally
lower than the same month last year because of weather and
equipment availability.
</P>
<P>
BHP's production of silver in concentrate in June was 1.14
million ounces.
</P>
<P>
Platinum in concentrate production was 1.36 million ounces.
</P>
<P>
Production at BHP's Cannington silver mine in Queensland,
Australia, and the Hartley platinum mine in Zimbabwe began in
October last year.

<HEADLINE> WTO Chief Enveils Plan for Enhanced Cooperation With NGOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Head of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) Renato Ruggiero announced here Friday a plan to
enhance his organization's cooperation with non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) in response to the United States' call for
increased transparency at the world trade watchdog.
</P>
<P>
However, Ruggiero insisted that the WTO will continue to be run
by rules, not by powers.
</P>
<P>
He said that issues including opening Dispute Settlement
hearings and other WTO meetings to the public "can only be
approved by a consensus of member states."
</P>
<P>
"The same situation pertains to the issue of more rapid
derestriction of documents," Ruggiero told reporters at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
As part of the plan for cooperation with NGOs, Ruggiero said,
the External Relations Division of the WTO will begin a program of
regular briefings for NGOs on the work of WTO committees and
working groups.
</P>
<P>
The WTO secretariat will also extend each month to the 132 WTO
members a list of documents, position papers and newsletters
submitted by NGOs. These documents will be made available on
demand to WTO members.
</P>
<P>
The WTO will open a special section on its website to NGO
issues. The list of documents submitted to the secretariat by the
NGOs will appear on the site, as will all upcoming WTO symposia or
other events organized for the benefit of NGOs.

<HEADLINE> US Welcomes WTO Chief's Efforts for Better Cooperation With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States has praised the
World Trade Organization (WTO) Director-General Renato Ruggiero
for his efforts to improve the organization's cooperation with
non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
</P>
<P>
"Renato Riggiero has been the right man for the job in leading
members of this organization in the transition from the GATT into
the WTO," said Rita Hayes, U.S. permanent representative to the
WTO, in a statement issued here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The director-general has been providing the kind of pro-active
leadership the WTO needs at this point in opening up the system to
allow more interaction with 'stakeholders'," the U.S. trade envoy
said.
</P>
<P>
She expressed hope that the WTO chief's efforts in designing
and developing dialogue with the NGOs will be "very helpful to us
and all WTO members in building support for the initiatives likely
to be associated with the third ministerial conference" scheduled
to be held in the middle of November 1999 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The success of that meeting and the launching of negotiations
will no doubt depend in part on the private sector believing that
it had a real input in developing the agenda," Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
In a proposal to the WTO General Council Wednesday, the United
States complained that the minutes of General Council meetings
generally come out only a month after the events, and even then
they are marked "restricted" and may remain unavailable to the
press and general public for as long as six months.
</P>
<P>
The same problem exists with panel reports, leading to
different interpretations by interested parties who would claim
victory by quoting parts of the reports, the Americans claimed.
</P>
<P>
In a speech on Wednesday responding to the United States'
proposal to increase the organization's transparency, Ruggiero
urged the General Council of the WTO to do more to promote
transparency and dispel the misleading impression of secrecy.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that no real progress will be made to improve the
exchange of information about the nature and goals of the WTO
unless there is a strong commitment from the governments of its
members.
</P>
<P>
As for the problems from the disclosure of panel findings of
the WTO dispute settlement body, Ruggiero put the blame on "the
fact that we are prevented from responding to, and correcting,
these inaccuracies by the rules of this organization."

<HEADLINE> Workers at S. Korean Automaker Threaten Another Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The labor union at South Korea's
Hyuandai Motor Co. threatened Friday to stage a strike if the
management pushes ahead with its planned mass layoffs.
</P>
<P>
"We will go on strike indefinitely if the management lays off
workers," a union spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The threat came after the management, of the automaker with a
domestic work force of 45,000, said it will lay off 2,678 workers
under a corporate restructuring program.
</P>
<P>
The number of layoffs is down from the original 4,830. But it
still angered union workers who had returned to work Thursday
morning after a two-day strike to protest against the plan.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came hours after the labor union offered to
cut wages, benefits and other costs as an alternative to layoffs.
</P>
<P>
The union also urged the management to consider cutting work
hours, or allow job-sharing, but the management said such measures
were not enough to pull the company out of the business slump.
</P>
<P>
The company said 15,031 workers are either underemployed or
redundant. Of them, only 6,842 will be allowed to keep their
names on Hyundai's payroll through wage cuts.
</P>
<P>
The current financial crisis in South Korea has dented in the
nation's auto industry, causing Hyundai to operate only 50 percent
of its capacity.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai Motor is the first subsidiary of South Korea's large
conglomerates, or chaebol, to lay off workers. Other chaebol
subsidiaries suffering from sluggish business are closely watching
the Hyundai.
</P>
<P>
From Tuesday through Thursday, tens of thousands of workers
went on strike to protest against the government's forced economic
restructuring, which they claim will lead to mass layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Demanding an end to the program and the release of 83 arrested
union chiefs who led this week's strikes, the Korean Confederation
of Trade Unions (KCTU) and the Federation of Korean Trade Unions
(FKTU) have threatened to stage another general strike next week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government began Friday behind-the-scenes
negotiations with the labor community to defuse tensions.
</P>
<P>
An agreement signed last December with the International
Monetary Fund for a loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars to help the
economic recovery obligated South Korea to open its market, shut
down ailing financial institutions and restructure the economy.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Banks' Bad Debts Could Hit 122 Billion US dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 17 (Xinhua) -- If the defaulted bill rate reaches
one percent this year, South Korea's domestic banks' bad debts are
expected to hit 157 trillion won (some 120.7 billion U.S.
dollars), Hyundai Economic Research Institute said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a report, the institute said a yearly defaulted bill rate of
one percent is expected to increase commercial banks'
non-performing loans to 54.6 trillion won (about 42 billion
dollars) by the end of this year, up 40.4 percent from the 38.9
trillion won (about 30 billion dollars) as of March 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
If the debts at nonbanking institutions are included, the total
non-performing loans would swell to 79.5 trillion won (about 61
billion dollars) by the year-end, said the report.
</P>
<P>
These will push up total bad debts, including loans with
overdue interest payments for three to six months, to 157.2
trillion won (about 120.9 billion dollars) by the end of 1998,
compared with 112 trillion won (about 92.3 billion dollars) at the
end of March this year.
</P>
<P>
The institute, which said the defaulted bill rate in the
first-quarter period had already reached 0.72 percent even before
the government had conducted its financial and industrial
restructuring, predicted that the rate would easily top 1 percent
when the economic reforms get into full swing.

the council meeting of NATO foreign ministers in May to reflect
its concern at the crisis in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The western military alliance carried out an air-borne exercise
with more than 80 airplanes last month in Albania and Macedonia to
demonstrate its ability to deploy troops rapidly in the region.

<P>
Speaking at the graduation ceremony of the Intensified Learning
Opportunity Program of the University of Hong Kong, Chan said the
annual investment of the SAR government in higher education is 13
billion HK dollars (1.7 billion U.S. dollars), about one-third of
the government's total investment in education.

<HEADLINE> Floods Claim 1,000 Lives in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Floods have killed more than 1,000
people across China this year, according to the Ministry of Civil
Affairs today.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains which hit early March, and have been
especially heavy since June, have led to heavy flooding in a dozen
provinces and regions, mostly in areas south of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Regions seriously affected by flooding include Jiangxi, Fujian,
Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Sichuan, Anhui and Zhejiang provinces,
the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu, Henan, Heilongjiang, Shaanxi and Shandong provinces,
as well as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also reported
problems related to minor flooding, according to the Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Statistics through July 15 show that floods have affected more
than 140 million people across the country. Floods have destroyed
some 2.9 million houses, decimated nine million hectares of crops
and caused direct economic losses estimated at over 84 billion
yuan (10 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Civil Affairs said that the
vast majority of deaths resulted from drownings, collapsing houses
and lightning.
</P>
<P>
"The efforts of health departments have prevented outbreaks of
epidemics in flood-stricken areas," according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He noted mud flows and landslides resulting from mountain
torrents have also caused many deaths.
</P>
<P>
"The results show the importance for protecting vegetation and
ecological environments in mountainous regions," said the
official.

Meteorologists say that many parts of China, especially areas
south of the Yangtze, have witnessed unusual extended periods of
heavy rainfall this year.
</P>
<P>
Various areas have reported rainfall accumulations expected
once every 100 years, while other areas have witnessed extended
periods of rain.
</P>
<P>
Local weather experts attribute the irregularities to "El Nino"
and point out that flooding occurred in China much more frequently
in the 1990s than in previous decades.
</P>
<P>
Flooding represented the major natural disaster China suffered
in 1991, 1994 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Sun Shaocheng, deputy director of the Disaster Relief
Department of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, said his ministry and
the Ministry of Finance have allocated 320 million yuan (40 million
US dollars) in relief funds to flood-stricken areas and
provided over 6,200 tents for homeless people.
</P>
<P>
He said governments at all levels in flood-stricken areas have
allocated over 300 million yuan to assist people in related areas.
</P>
<P>
"Flood waters have not as yet receded in certain areas in Hunan
and Jiangxi, with many people in said areas forced to live on
dikes and dams," according to Sun.
</P>
<P>
He predicted a decrease this year's summer grain harvest based
on the fact that flooding has seriously damaged early rice
cultivation in southern provinces.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists note the rain belt is moving northward, with
chances for major flooding diminishing.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, they warned of the continuing dangers of serious
flooding since China's rainy season usually ends in late August
and typhoons typically hit in the summer.

<HEADLINE> World's Coral Reefs in Danger: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Human development is threatening
the future of nearly 60 percent of the world's coral reefs,
according to a recent study released here by the World Research
Institute (WRI).
</P>
<P>
Coastal development, overfishing and destructive fishing, and
pollution resulting from both land and marine based activities
are doing the most to destroy the reefs, the Kenya Times
newspaper Friday quoted the study as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The most threatened reefs are found in southeast Asia, where
an estimated 82 percent are considered to be at medium or high
risk, and more than half of the reefs in the Middle East, the
Caribbean and the Indian Ocean face similar degrees of threat.
</P>
<P>
"Like rain forests, reefs harbor much of the planet's wealth
of species and are being rapidly degraded by humans," said Dirk
Bryant, co-author of the report.
</P>
<P>
"Yet we know far less about the health of reefs than we do of
rain forests," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 56-page report, titled "Reefs at Risk", is co-financed by
WRI, the Nairobi-based U.N. Environment Program (UNEP), the
Britain-based World Conservation Monitoring Center (WCMC), and
the International Center for Living Aquatic Resources Management
in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Despite their long age -- some living coral reefs are 2.5
million years old -- very little was known about the extent and
condition of coral reefs until an initial survey of 108 countries
was completed by the WCMC in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The first global map depicting the location of shallow reefs
around the world was published by WCMC only in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Reefs occupy less than 0.25 percent of the earth's total
marine environment, yet they are home to more than a quarter of
all known marine fish species, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"Coral reefs are among the most valuable eco-systems on earth
because of their immense biological wealth and the economic and
environmental services they provide to millions of people," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
It's estimated that reef habitats provide human with living
resources, and services including tourism and protect inhabited
coasts from waves and storms, all of which worth almost 400
billion U.S. Dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Concern about these habitats has grown as more has become
known about them.
</P>
<P>
A widely-cited 1993 report asserted that ten percent of the
world's reefs were dead and another 30 percent were likely to die
within 20 years. However, the latest study said this was based
on anecdotal evidence and scientific "guesswork".
</P>
<P>
Even today, 90 percent of the world's reefs remain to be
comprehensively assessed for damage.
</P>
<P>
The report, dubbed by its authors as the "first systematic and
data-driven global assessment" of the reefs, is reportedly an
attempt to indicate the nature and extent of the major threats
the reefs face.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the report's conclusions "are a best
estimate, rather than a catalogue, of actual damage".
</P>
<P>
The report found that 58 percent of the world's reefs are
under high or medium threat from human activity.
Over-exploitation of fisheries and other reef resources as well
as coastal development represent about two-thirds of the threat.
</P>
<P>
The estimation probably is conservative because it does not
consider future threats such as population growth or global
warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that the coral reefs in southeast Asia,
which are the most species-rich on earth, are also the most
threatened.
</P>
<P>
The study said the reefs of the southern Islands in Singapore,
the Bolinao Reef Complex in the Philippines, the Scarborough Reef
in the South China Sea and the Seribu Islands Reefs in the Java
Sea near Jakarta are among the 12 most threatened in the world.
</P>
<P>
Other danger spots include the Florida Keys Reefs in the
United States, the Bhia Las Minas Reefs near Panama, the Jamaica
reef off Jamaica, the Red Sea Riviera along the Gulf of the Aqaba
off Jordan, Israel and Egypt, and several reefs under U.S.
control in the central and western Pacific.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Poor Housing Program Tops Estrada's Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
has proposed the establishment of a guarantee fund for housing
which he expects to be set up within his first 100 days in office.
</P>
<P>
The fund, which will provide poor families with long-term,
affordable credit to own decent dwellings, forms part of Estrada's
first 100 days' People's Priority Agenda to be presented to
Congress on July 27, a news release from the Presidential Palace
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the establishment of a guarantee fund, the Estrada
administration's strategy in dealing with the housing problem also
includes the participation of the private sector in the
government's mass housing program.
</P>
<P>
Estrada's agenda also involves the construction, management and
maintenance of low-cost housing by the private sector with the
government simply providing the seed capital and setting minimum
performance standards.
</P>
<P>
The administration will also propose several incentives,
including tax-free donations, to encourage the private sector and
non-government organizations to finance low-cost housing programs
and set up a mortgaged securities market.

CAIRO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The Cypriot Government has decided to allow offshore
companies to invest in the Cyprus Stock Exchange in accordance
with a new amendment to the income tax law for offshore companies.
</P>
<P>
The amendment, which was passed by the House of
Representatives early this month, also provides for a five-year
tax break for newly-listed public companies, with 100,000 Cyprus
pounds (about 200,000 U.S. dollars) in profit as the maximum
allowance.
</P>
<P>
Investors are given tax breaks if they invest in newly-listed
local companies.
</P>
<P>
Previously, if an offshore company invested in businesses on
the island, it lost its beneficial income tax status.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Cyprus Airways Group registered losses in 1997 of
3.2 million Cyprus pounds (about 6.4 million U.S. dollars)
compared to 4.7 million pounds (9.4 million dollars) losses the
year before, Chairman of the Group, Takis Kyriakides, said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the Group's total revenue reached 135.2 million pounds
(270.4 million dollars) in 1997 compared with 126.2 million pounds
(252.4 million dollars) the year before, registering a 7.1 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
Kyriakides explained that the Group's registered increase in
revenue was due to a 5.4 percent rise in the number of passengers
it carried, from 1,226,000 in 1996 to 1,292,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the Group's losses to the increasing labor
costs, which recorded a 5.3 percent increase compared with the
year before.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- Latest official statistics reveal that the volume of
Morocco's foreign debts have fallen for the first time below the
20 billion U.S. dollar level which has been kept for almost a
decade.
</P>
<P>
These figures indicate that Morocco's foreign debts amount to
19,096 million dollars, representing about 58 per cent of the
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, these debts stood at 21.3 billion dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
committed to improving the overall condition of the country's two
sea ports to ensure the full use of trade opportunities in
external markets, an official handout said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Commerce and Industries Minister Tofael Ahmed made the remarks
while meeting a visiting mission of the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) here Thursday, the handout said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB mission is here to give a proper shape to a
167.5-million U.S.-dollar port efficiency and access improvement
project to be undertaken in the country.
</P>
<P>
The project includes the installation of modern quayside cargo
and container handling equipment in the country's two sea ports of
Chittagong and Mongla, the handout said.
</P>
<P>
With the implementation of the project, the private sector will
be a big beneficiary by being able to quickly dispatch their
imported and exported goods, thus making a good impact on the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has been maintaining an export growth rate of over
17 percent, the minister said, adding that the country plans to
expand the annual export from the present 5.2 billion dollars to
8-10 billion dollars by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
The government is trying to improve the infrastructure
facilities like setting up of a deep-sea port at Patenga Point
southeast of here to cope with the country's fast-growing trade,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Port operation should be efficient and competitive, and we are
trying to ensure it for the exporters and importers."

<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Buddhist Theological Institute
of China plans to double its enrollment following completion of a
new teaching building.
</P>
<P>
Monk Sheng Hui, vice-president of the institute, said today
that the institute will enroll over 200 students every two years,
or twice the former enrollment of 90 students.
</P>
<P>
The new building will be completed at a cost of 11 million yuan
raised by Buddhist monks and followers from both at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The two-story building, which will have a total floor space of
2,348 square meters. will feature classrooms, offices and storage
rooms for Buddhist classics.
</P>
<P>
Venerable Zhao Puchu, president of the institute and the
Buddhist Association of China, said the Buddhist institute was the

</P>
<P>
The institute, which was established in 1956, was closed during
the "Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976) and reopened in 1980. The
300-odd monks trained at the institute have grown into the pillar
of Chinese Buddhism.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland May Curb S. African Cheap Food Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland's agricultural
industry, reeling from the effects of cheaper food products
flooding in from South Africa, plans to respond with increased
levies and border inspection, Business Day newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland's National Agricultural Marketing Board (Namboard),
alleged that South African goods, ranging from fresh produce to
dairy products, were dumped in Swaziland and said that the matter
was being taken up with the Southern African Customs Union which
both South Africa and Swaziland belong to.
</P>
<P>
The paper Friday quoted Namboard leader, Magalela Ngwenya,
as saying that his organization was likely to ask the Swazi
Agriculture Ministry to set levies on the offending food imports.
</P>
<P>
He said the dumping was attributable to different factors,
chief among them the South African government's move last year to
shut down control boards.
</P>
<P>
This resulted in cheap produce flooding South Africa from
overseas, to the ultimate detriment of Swaziland, said Ngwenya.
</P>
<P>
When wheat flour from South Africa flooded the Swazi market
late last year, local industries lost 1.5 million Rand (about
300,000 U.S. dollars valued at that time) every month in the last
quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
Namboard estimates that the "dumping" of South African produce
onto the Swazi market incurred losses of 3.5 million Rand
(700,000 dollars) last year.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Firmer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar gained more
than half a U.S. cent Friday to reach its strongest closing level
since mid-May.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed trading at 63.33 U.S. cents, from its
close in Sydney Thursday of 62.78 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Hopes that the Japanese government would introduce economic
reforms and tax cuts to lift the country out of recession filtered
through to the Australian dollar via the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
Australia's strong trade ties with Japan have kept the
Australian dollar linked to the Japanese currency recently. Japan
accounts for about 20 percent of Australia's total goods and
service export each year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was trading at 87.99 Japanese yen Friday
in Sydney from 87.50 yen previously and 1.1314 German marks from
1.1266 marks.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Reviving Up Operations in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force, ECOMOG, has moved 94 percent of its troops from Liberia to
Sierra Leone in a bid to enhance the mopping up of remnants of
the junta forces and allied rebels in that country.
</P>
<P>
Progress has been made despite some logistic problems, said
ECOMOG Force Commander Timothy Shelpidi, quoted by This Day
newspaper Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian general claimed that his troops, in their mopping
up exercise, have gone round the Kono district which is very
mountainous.
</P>
<P>
But things are now not easy for ECOMOG because the rebel
juntas know very well the environment of the areas where have
been their base and hideouts, particularly with the coming of the
raining season, he noted.
</P>
<P>
A lot of bridges have been destroyed by junta men, thus
delaying ECOMOG's operations as the areas are not easily
accessible, he added.
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficulties, ECOMOG has captured many rebels who
afterwards surrendered their weapons, while others are willing to
surrender.
</P>
<P>
The general said he had been expecting the support from the
United Nations which recently decided to send an observers
mission to the tiny west African country.

<HEADLINE> Interview: HK's Information Policy Remains Unchanged: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's policy on press
freedom remains unchanged after its return to China last July,
said Thomas Chan, director of the Information Services Department
(ISD) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua at his office, Chan said: "our
information policy is very simple. We respect freedom of the press
without any regulations to control news reporting. The media are
expected to play a part in supervising the government and can
report freely without restriction except in the areas of
pornography, defamation or court proceeding as specified under the
law."
</P>
<P>
He said that the secretary for home affairs has overall
responsibility for policy formulation on information and related
matters, while the director of the ISD advises the government on
the presentation of its policies and on public relations matters
generally, both within Hong Kong and overseas.
</P>
<P>
"The main aims are to ensure an open exchange of information in
the community and to keep the media fully informed of the
government's plans and policies, so that members of the public are
kept aware of government activities which affect their lives, and
to promote Hong Kong's image overseas," he added.
</P>
<P>
There are now about 50 daily newspapers, more than 600
periodicals, 3 television stations and 3 radio stations as well as
about 150 foreign media organizations in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
During the hour-long interview, Chan said that the Central
Government has never tried to change Hong Kong's present
information policy since the SAR was established one year ago.
</P>
<P>
He said local residents enjoy the same freedom of speech and
publication after Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
The ISD serves as the government's public relations consultant,
publisher, advertising agent and news agency. It provides the link
between the administration and the media and, through the latter,
enhances public understanding of government policies, decisions
and activities.
</P>
<P>
With a staff of more than 500, the ISD is operating as usual
after the handover, he said. It publishes on the Internet a daily
information bulletin in English and Chinese which contains all
government press releases.

<P>
ISD staff worked long hours as so many important events, such
as the handover ceremony, the Annual Meetings of the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund as well as the Legislative
Council election, took place one after another in Hong Kong over
the past year.
</P>
<P>
"In order to increase transparency and openness of the
government, we try to arrange more direct dialogues between
government officials and local residents over the past year, thus
making them know more of each other's views," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the ISD maintains direct contact with the media on a
24-hour basis and answers media's inquiries round the clock.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that a key objective of the government's information
policy is to project an accurate image of Hong Kong overseas.
</P>
<P>
To maintain the international community's interest in Hong Kong
after the handover, the government has stepped up promotional
activities overseas.
</P>
<P>
Both Administrative Secretary Anson Chan and Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang went abroad to tell foreign business people
 how well Hong Kong has managed the transition and that Hong Kong
is still an ideal place not only for investment but also for
tourism, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, to enable local people to know what happens in
Hong Kong in the shortest possible time, the ISD has made great
efforts to realize the computerization of its work ranging from
news compilation to news release and publicity design.
</P>
<P>
Chan, who is well versed in computer knowledge, launched the
first government home page in San Francisco introducing Hong Kong
to the world before he came to the ISD.
</P>
<P>
The ISD established an Internet Resource Center last year to
help bureaus and departments set up home pages and to consider how
the government could improve the dissemination of information
through better use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
It also introduced a new digital photo system last July,
through which photos can be sent to media organizations and news
agencies via a computer network.
</P>
<P>
"We are concentrating our efforts on improving our work by
developing more advanced computerized system to meet the needs of
customers and continuously maintain Hong Kong as an international
information center," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- About 100,000 traffic related
court cases in Addis Ababa have been settled during the past five
months, the Ethiopian Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mesfin Adise, president of Addis Ababa courts for traffic
related cases, told the press that the cases under consideration
were from last January 20 to July 8.
</P>
<P>
Mesfin disclosed that the total fines amounted to two million
Birr (about 285,714 US Dollars) with the offenders having been
fined from between 10 to 200 Birr (1.4 to 28.57 US Dollars).
</P>
<P>
He explained that the number of cases within a short period of
five months indicates a very high rate of traffic-related
offences in the country.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the urban traffic courts has played a
major role in easing the load of work of the federal courts and
federal first instance courts.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the new traffic regulation, he said, traffic
fines are imposed by the regional transport and communications
bureaux concerned and only in case of complaint can this be
considered by the traffic courts.
</P>
<P>
According to Addis Ababa transport and communications
authority, about 500 drivers in Addis Ababa trespass traffic
rules and regulation daily and an average 700 car accidents are
registered each month.
</P>
<P>
Some 531 persons lost their lives in car accidents in the past
two years in the city, 2,514 others sustained injuries and
properties worth over 2.8 million US Dollars were damaged.
</P>
<P>
The Addis Ababa city administration introduced recently a new
traffic regulation to contain traffic irregularities in the city.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Presses on with Building First Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 17 (Xinhua) - The Tanzanian government has
allocated more than one billion shilings (about 1.52 million U.S.
Dollars) to boost the construction of its first mining college to
meet a crying need by the growing mining sector for professionals.
</P>
<P>
The college principal Joshua Kilebuka was quoted Friday by
local media as saying that the college, on the outskirts of
central Dodoma city, will open next year.
</P>
<P>
Kilebuka said the college is expected to train indigenous
mining experts not only for the growing small scale gemstone
mining sector, but also for the big new mining companies which
need local manpower.
</P>
<P>
"The college will train 40 full technician course graduates
annually at both diploma and certificate levels," he said. "It
will also offer short courses, researches and workshops for
miners."
</P>
<P>
The construction of the college comes in the wake of an
upsurge in mining over the last decade following liberalization
of the sector.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Ministry of Minerals and Energy estimates
that the small scale miners produce about 99 percent of the
country's total gemstone output, but they are in "critical
shortage of mining professionals".
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has a total of about 200 geologists, 54 mining and
processing engineers and 156 geological field technicians.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 miners were entombed in the rain-hit Mererani
Tanzanite mines in northern Arusha region in April this year due
to the lack of basic safety technology.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister for Minerals and Energy Manju Msambya said
that his ministry is trying to get money from donors to
facilitate the construction of the college and to recruit
competent mining tutors to ensure the quality of trainees.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Bank of Tanzania, the central bank, for the
1996/97 fiscal year indicates that the mineral exports earned
67.1 million U. S. Dollars, accounting for seven percent of the
total export earnings.

peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) to beef up security in the country at
the critical time of the military government's transition to
civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
"It's a rumor because the rotation of soldiers to serve ECOMOG
is a routine exercise," said Ugbo.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told Xinhua that the redeployed
soldiers who have served in the Nigerian contingent of ECOMOG for
three years would be replaced by another set of 3,000 fresh
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Arrangements have been concluded by the military authorities
to move another three battalions of troops to ECOMOG in a
replacement for the three battalions that are expected to arrive
from Saturday in four batches.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led ECOMOG has succeeded in ending the nine-year
civil war in Liberia and restoring the elected government of
Sierra Leone which was ousted in a coup in May last year.

<HEADLINE> French Minister to Visit Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- French Cooperation Minister Charles
Josselin is to visit Nigeria in the next few days to make contact
with the country's new leader Abdulsalam Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
French Minister for Parliamentary Relations Daniel Vaillant
made the announcement Wednesday during a weekly meeting of the
French cabinet, the local Nigerian media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Vaillant described the visit of Josselin to Nigeria as
"political and diplomatic."
</P>
<P>
Josselin's coming visit is the latest in a series by Western
countries trying to encourage General Abubakar in his commitment
to continuing Nigeria's transition to democratic civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
British Junior Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd and the U.S.
Undersecretary for Political Affairs, Thomas Pickering, have
visited Nigeria earlier.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the French Foreign Ministry said that the
government has confidence in General Abubakar's resolve to
oversee the transition to democratic rule, in which the country's
main political forces would have a say.
</P>
<P>
Previously, "there was a risk that elections would go ahead
with a single candidate, but today, things are more open, a real
democratic transition is underway," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The international community has reacted positively to these
changes, which now must be reinforced and followed through," it
added.

<HEADLINE> SKorean Foreign Currency Reserve Rises to $41.88 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 17 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign currency
reserve jumped to 41.88 billion U.S. dollars as of July 15, an
increase of 980 million dollars from the end of last month, the
central Bank of Korea said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The usable foreign reserve, which excludes domestic banks'
deposits at overseas branches, also grew 1.05 billion dollars to
38.09 billion dollars in the period.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the rise of the usable foreign reserve to
the domestic commercial banks' repayment of an additional 640
million dollars to the central bank, which extended emergency fund
to the commercial banks after the financial crisis took place late
last year due to corporate failures and bad loans of financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Domestic banks have returned 12.2 billion dollars of the
emergency fund they borrowed from the central bank. In the future,
they have to pay back 11.09 billion dollars to the bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Road Authority
said that the Dire Dawa-Dewele Road that connects Djibouti and
Ethiopia is under construction.
</P>
<P>
A local newspaper report Friday quoted Debebe Gizaw, Head of Public
Relations of the Ethiopian Road Authority, as saying that the
road which had been used by small vehicles until recently is now
crowded by about 700 heavy vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The increase in traffic is due to the increased use of the
Djibouti Port by Ethiopia following its border dispute with
Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
After the outbreak of Ethio-Eritrea border dispute in May,
Ethiopia has diverted from Assab Port of Eritrea to the port of
Djibouti as its outlet. About 300 Ethiopian trucks are
moving 6,000 tons a day through Djibouti, said an Ethiopian
government spokesperson in an earlier statement.

DAR ES SALAAM, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian State Power
Company plans to provide electricity to major towns and tourist
attractions in the northern regions of Arusha and Kilimanjaro by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The projects will be financed by the African Development Bank
(ADB) and the Nordic Development Fund (NDF), the Daily News
Friday quoted Alhaj Aboud Maalim, Board Chairman of the Tanzania
Electric Supply Company (TANESCO), as saying.

<P>
ADB will provide 43.3 million U.S. Dollars while the state
will grant seven billion Shillings (about 10.5 million U.S.
Dollars) for the program, Maalim said, adding that the NDF has
already provided five million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The board chairman was briefing President Benjamin Mkapa on
the company's blueprint in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
"All principal towns of Kiteto, Mbulu and Karatu will be
provided with reliable power supply and the small town of Mto wa
Mbu and the Lake Manyara and Ngorongoro crater tourist hotels
will be supplied with electricity," Maalim was quoted by the
paper as saying.

<HEADLINE> Field Mice: Deadly Virus Carrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, July 17 (Xinhua)-- Swedish researchers have found
that the harmless-looking field mouse can be carrying a deadly
virus.
</P>
<P>
They suspect the rodent spreads a virus that causes
myocarditis, a serious infection of the cardiac muscle. Over a
dozen Swedish die from this disease yearly.
</P>
<P>
The theory about the field mice' potential danger arose after
six young Swedish orienteers died of myocarditis in early 1990.
</P>
<P>
Bo Niklasson, a professor of virology at the Institute of
Protection Against Infectious Diseases, said that while they have
established the link between the rodent and the disease, they
have yet to nail down how the virus is spread.
</P>
<P>
"It would be wise for parents to keep small children away from
the rodent," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan MPs Want Speaker Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They voiced the outcry Thursday during a discussion at the

NRM's first national congress being held here, the New Vision paper

reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Holding both public offices concurrently is unconstitutional,

they said, because it causes inefficiency, duplicate work and

compromises the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Aggrey Awori, a MP from Samia Bugwe North, was quoted

as saying that those who have accepted new appointments

should vacate their seats in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Wapakhabulo and several other MPs appointed

directors to the NRM secretariat, a senior Movement leader said on

condition of anonymity: "These people must go otherwise we shall be

seen to be greedy and bending the law to suit our needs."
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, the constitution bars MPs from holding two public

offices at the same time while the Movement National Executive

Committee has allowed the MPs to hold both offices.
</P>
<P>
All ministers in Uganda are MPs and they are supposed to

support the bills presented to the floor by the government.
</P>
<P>
At present, the name of First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

of Foreign Affairs Eriya Kategaya has been floated for the post of

Speaker.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution and rules of procedure of Parliament, once

the office of Speaker falls vacant, the office must be filled before

any business can be conducted by Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Says Sanctions on Iraq Crumbling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
said on Friday that U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq are crumbling
and would end soon with Iraqis' steadfastness, unwavering position
in demand of lifing the blockade.
</P>
<P>
In a nationally broadcast speech on the 30th anniversary of
1968 revolution, that brought his Baath party to power, the Iraqi
president expressed the hope that "this year, and the time that
follows will be the year and time of virtual erosion of the
blockade off Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed the sanctions on Iraq in 1990 after its
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president tried to play down the expectations
of the people by saying that "the blockade will not be lifted by a
unanimous U.N. Security Council resolution."
</P>
<P>
"Rather," he added, "it will erode -- the more Iraqis remain
firm in their position, the more the implications of this
position" will attract the attention of the Arabs and the rest of
the world.
</P>
<P>
The president mentioned the open letter addressed to the
U.N. Security Council and secretary-general on May 1 this year,
which demanded immediate lifting of trade embargo off Iraq as a
prelude to lift the overall U.N. sanctions off Iraq, and warned of
severe consequences if the Council failed to respond to the letter
positively.
</P>
<P>
"It (the letter) was not a mere outcry of protest, but an
expression of determination and an alternative strategy," should
other means fail, the president cautioned.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Minority Pupils Village For Frontier Education (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- In an outlying mountainous part of
southwest China's Yunnan Province, the flag is raised every Monday
morning in a unique "village" composed of more than 280 pupils and
12 teachers.
</P>
<P>
The village is actually a primary school of Yunlong County,
with a two-story building, a rough playground in front, and a
number of log cabins scattered here and there.
</P>
<P>
The cabins were designed and built by the pupils and serve as
private dormitories, because, unlike the more prosperous boarding
schools in urban areas, the pupils of this school come from poor
families and have to look after themselves.
</P>
<P>
The first cabin was put up by Zhang Yiqing who studies and
lives in the 10-square-meter room he built with timber and pieces
of wood.
</P>
<P>
His classmates come from the village of Tiandeng, where 560
households are scattered across a 168-sq km area, quite a
distance from the primary school, so they followed Zhang's lead
and gradually turned the small campus into a village.
</P>
<P>
When the school lets out at four o'clock in the afternoon, the
pupils return to their cabins to prepare supper. Li Jinyan, a
first-year pupil, is standing over a pot of corn gruel on the
stove. And a cupboard holds buckwheat flour and dried vegetables,
and nearby is a little bed with a worn cotton-padded quilt.
</P>
<P>
The girl said that her parents used to come all the way here to
cook for her, but as she gradually got used to looking herself,
they came less and less, with the exception of weekends, when they
would take her home or bring her food, vegetables and firewood,
and other supplies.

<P>
Zhang Wendi, the headmaster of Lisu ethnic group, said that Li
Jinyan's story is a fairly typical one for the 281 pupils who, in
spite of all their difficulties and hardships, have done the best
they could, listening attentively in class, and then continuing to
study by candlelight beside their beds at night.
</P>
<P>
Tiandeng has approximately 2,700 people, the majority of whom
belong to the Lisu ethnic group. Half of them have to work very
hard just to feed themselves, and are certainly not able to save
anything. But, no matter how destitute they may be, they never
keep their children at home and away from school.
</P>
<P>
Yang Maochun, a 76-year-old villager, for example, has been
helping his daughter-in-law keep her two children at school ever
since their father died last year.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yuemei, another villager, manages to keep both her own
children and her younger sister at school. Her parents have been
dead for a long time.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, 33 of the pupils at the village are
orphans. The village committee managed to allocate 440,000 yuan
(53,000 US dollars) from its 600,000-yuan (72,300 US dollars) in
funds to build a small hydro-electric power station for the
school. On June 1 of this year, International Children's Day, the
county education bureau sent the pupils sport uniforms, so, for
the first time they had uniforms.
</P>
<P>
And, the local government provides every pupil with a small
monthly stipend to help get over some difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Fall in Tokyo After 4 Days of Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices fell in Tokyo Friday
following a previous four straight day increase due to a lack of
fresh buying incentives.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange dropped 161.14 points, or 0.96
percent, from Thursday's close to end at at 16,570.78.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, lost 2.78 points or 0.22 percent to 1,277.95.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section came to an estimated 400 million
shares, down from Thursday's 446.76 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB) was the day's most
heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Friday's drop was widely expected, considering that the Nikkei
had climbed 640 points, or almost four percent, over the four
previous days of trading.
</P>
<P>
Traders have repeatedly said that for the Nikkei to keep its
upward momentum, the market would need a truly significant boost,
such as the announcement of a major permanent cut in income taxes
as a means to revive consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
But many analysts predict such bold measures will not take
place until after the July 24 Liberal Democratic Party
presidential election, at which outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's successor is expected to be elected.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,332 issues listed on the First Section, losers
exceeded gainers 612 to 496, with 161 issues remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Romania"s Trade With Central Europe Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Romania's trade with Central
European countries grew rapidly after it joined the Central Europe
Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) a year ago, the ministry of industry
and trade said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Figures issued by the ministry show that in 1997, Romania's
total volume of trade with these countries exceeded one billion
U.S. dollars, a nearly 20 percent increase over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Despite its trade deficit with other CEFTA members, with
imports almost double exports, Romania's exports in the second
half of 1997 increased 70 percent over the same period of 1996.
And in the first quarter of 1998, Romania saw exports 19.3 percent
higher than the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Hungary and Poland are Romania's main trade partners in CEFTA.
Trade with these two countries last year reached 529 million
dollars and 191 million dollars respectively. Romania's trade is
also growing with Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
Romania signed the CEFTA on April 12, 1997, and became an
official member on July 1 the same year. The CEFTA, which was
launched on December 21, 1992 by Poland, Hungary and former
Czechoslovakia, now has six members, Poland, Hungary, the Czech
Republic, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia and Romania.

<HEADLINE> Anshan Iron &AMP; Steel Company to Use U.S. Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Anshan Iron and Steel Group
(Angang) in northeast China's Liaoning Province will use automatic
control and transmission systems from the U.S. Rockwell Automation
Company for its two new continuous casting production lines.
</P>
<P>
The two lines are scheduled begin operating next year and will
have an annual production capacity of 1.1 million tons of
first-class slab ingots and 700,000 tons of four-strand blooms.
</P>
<P>
The installation of the two lines is expected to help the group
raise its continuous casting ratio, which is a key index in
measuring production efficiency in the iron and steel industry,
from the current 40 percent to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The group sees the renovation project as an aid to raising its
continuous casting ratio.
</P>
<P>
Rockwell Automotion will provide a unique package of services
to Angang, including programmable controllers, transmission
systems, PCs, and other devices. It has provided equipment for the
Baoshan Iron and Steel Company in Shanghai and Wuhan Iron and
Steel Company in central China.
</P>
<P>
In China's industrial automation market, Rockwell Automation
competes with other U.S. companies and the German Siemens Company.
</P>
<P>
With the installation of another two new continuous casting
production lines, Angang expects to increase its continuous
casting ratio to more than 90 percent before the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Rockwell is a global electronic controls and communications
company with a leading position in industrial automation,
avionics, and electronics. In China, the company focuses its
investment in industrial automation.

<HEADLINE> Estrada to Ask Congress to Enact Land Use Code </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
will ask the 11th Congress, which opens its regular session on
July 27, to give priority to his proposal to place the entire
country under a comprehensive land use program.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said in a news release Friday that in line with his
objective, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive national
land use program to preserve rural areas earmarked for food
products.
</P>
<P>
In his scheduled first State of the Nation Address on July 27,
Estrada is expected to propose an integrated Land Use Act, which
he believes will curb the irrational conversion of prime
agricultural lands into industrial parks, resorts with golfing
courses and housing subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has called for a stop to the "irrational conversion" of
prime agricultural lands that has put the Comprehensive Agrarian
Reform Program in jeopardy and has been partly responsible for the
country's shrinking farm productivity.

<HEADLINE> Obuchi, Kajiyama to Run For LDP Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo
Obuchi and former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama
expressed their intentions Friday to run in the Liberal Democratic
Party's presidential race to succeed Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, 61, told a news conference that if elected "I will try
to resolve the difficulties at any cost."
</P>
<P>
"As a politician it is my mission to revive the Japanese and
Asian economies with all possible means and to tide over the
biggest difficulties since the end of World War II," Obuchi said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said he would also adopt a style of politics independent
of bureaucrats and promote negotiations with Russia to conclude a
peace treaty by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Kajiyama, 72, also said at a meeting of veteran and other LDP
lawmakers that he will run for the LDP presidency, Kyodo News said.
</P>
<P>
"I am determined to do my best by entrusting my body and spirit to
all of you," Kajiyama was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new LDP president is sure to become prime minister because
the LDP holds a majority in the House of Representatives (lower
house), which will elect a new prime minister on July 30.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto submitted his resignation as LDP president Monday to
take responsibility for the LDP's major setback in last Sunday's
House of Councillors (upper house) election.
</P>
<P>
Besides Obuchi and Kajiyama, another influential LDP faction
led by former Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, is also prepared
to field either Health and Welfare Minister Junichiro Koizumi or
LDP General Council Chairman Yoshiro Mori for the election,
according to Mitsuzuka faction sources.
</P>
<P>
A total of 413 LDP members are eligible to vote in the race,
which is expected to be held on July 24.

<HEADLINE>   Worldwide Wafer Fabrication Equipment Market Sluggish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The worldwide wafer
fabrication equipment market continues to be sluggish this year,
with revenue forecast to reach 16.7 billion U.S. dollars, down 17
percent from 1997, said Dataquest Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. California-based market research firm also forecast
that the market will have a smooth growth at 2.9 percent in
1999. But the firm's analysts said that the industry will achieve
a big boom in 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
The next six months will be extremely difficult in the market
because of oversupply. "Aggressive investment in 0.25-micron
technology throughout 1997 contributed to the continuing
overcapacity in the industry," Dataquest said in a report. "The
economic slowdown in Asia and Japan has made the 1998 spending
environment downright ugly."
</P>
<P>
But Dataquest analysts forecast a spending boom during
2000-2001, with a shortage of dynamic random access memory (DRAM)
emerging early in 2000. The worldwide wafer fabrication equipment
market will grow 37 percent in 2000 and 49.8 percent in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Stable Nigeria Best for Africa: Says OAU Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The successful democratization of
Nigeria will be in the interest of the entire African continent,
said Salim Ahmed Salim, the Secretary-General of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Salim arrived here Thursday for a meeting with Nigeria's Head
of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar scheduled for Friday in the
capital Abuja, the official New Nigeria newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief, who came to Nigeria at the invitation of
Abubakar, said that the meeting would go a long way to help in
resolving series of problems facing the most populous African
country.
</P>
<P>
Salim said that OAU's interest in the country's affairs did
not narrow down to business alone but anything that would promote
peaceful co-existence in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever happens here concerns all the people of Africa. We
have stake in the future of this country. A stake that will
promote stability," Salim said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that given the sad moments the country had gone
through, it would be ideal for every Nigerian to see the present
political situation as an opportunity to advance a virile
governance.
</P>
<P>
"The transition program is essential in Nigeria, we will do
what is required of us, not only on Nigeria's problems but also
in African affairs," Salim added.
</P>
<P>
Salim's visit followed those by his counterparts in the United
Nations, Kofi Annan, and the Commonwealth, Emeka Anyaoku, who
ended their visits to the country earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
According to Salim, the pan-African body is very happy with
the developments in Nigeria, especially at this difficult
and challenging time.
</P>
<P>
"We are very much encouraged with the steps taken by the head
of state so far. We wish Nigeria to pursue the path we have
always advocated, the path to democratic dispensation," he said.

PARIS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Friday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The diplomatic offensive by Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in
France coincided with a series of actions at home in preparation for
his succession. Assad recently made a number of purges in the
military institutions and replaced the mayors of several majors
cities of his country, in an initiative to reform the country which
for a long time has neither political life, nor economic initiative,
nor transparency.
</P>
<P>
-- The Spanish judicial authorities has closed a newspaper which
is close to the armed wing of the Basque separatist group ETA. The
closing of the daily ``Egin'' has caused strong backwash in Spain,
because it was the first of its kind since the end of the
dictatorship of General Franco.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The head of the finance commission of the National Assembly
Didier Migaud Thursday presented concrete proposals on the reform of
France's private fortune tax, the ISF, which is expected to raise
the income from the tax by 2 billion francs (333 million U.S.
dollars) each year. The Communist proposal to include professional
properties, or working tools, into the ISF has been abandoned.
</P>
<P>
-- The threat by the government to impose tax on ownership of
objects of arts is handicaping the French arts market which is
seeing an exodus toward New York and London. However, the first half
of 1998 has been encouraging with a 10 percent rise of transactions
in Paris arts market, mainly because of a 51.5 billion francs (8.6
billion U.S. dollars) transactions of the works of Eugene Delacroix
at the Drouot, Paris's biggest arts marketplace.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Sugar Firms in Crisis Over Cheap Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Leading Kenyan sugar companies
are facing a marketing crisis following dumping of cheap imports,
officials from sugar industry and the Federation of Kenya
Employers (FKE) have complained.
</P>
<P>
The companies are holding large stocks of sugar which they
cannot sell due to saturation of the market with cheap imports.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is pretty bad," Western Kenya FKE Chairman
Absolom Moseti said Thursday. "The companies, which are our
members, are again facing a marketing crisis and this is causing
them serious cash flow problems."
</P>
<P>
According to Moseti, sales of most companies have dropped by
over 50 percent in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
A Mumias Sugar Company official said that they have over
20,000 tons of sugar in their stores, saying the company is
unable to get market for the commodity.
</P>
<P>
"The stocks are simply not moving... this is causing the
company cash flow problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We recently reduced our sugar prices to see whether we could
compete in the market," said the company official.
</P>
<P>
Chemelil Sugar Company said it has stocks worth over 178
million Shillings (some 2.97 million U.S. Dollars), while Sony is
stuck with stocks worth 200 million Shillings (about 3.33 million
U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
"If the problem persists, the company might just be forced to
close down," said an official with the Chemelil company.
</P>
<P>
Mumias usually crashes 8,000 tons of sugar a day with Sony and
Chemelil each 3,000 tons. The three are among the largest sugar
companies in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's annual consumption of sugar stands at 560,000 tons
while its total production is about 400,000 tons, the East
African Standard newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, after the market liberalization at the end of 1980s,
Kenya's sugar industry bore the brunt in the so-called transit sugar
dumping in the local market.

<P>
CANBEERA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Australian sports officials are
hoping to host the 2001 Goodwill Games, according to reports from
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
An Australian state government minister flew to New York on
Friday to try to persuade Games founder Ted Turner to take the
multi-sport extravaganza to Brisbane in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Brisbane hosted the 1982 Commonwealth Games and was nominated
for the 1992 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"We're optimistic but still there's no decision," said a
spokesman for Queensland state sports minister Bob Gibbs. "If we
won it, it would be an enormous benefit for Queensland."
</P>
<P>
The Goodwill Games were founded by Turner in 1986. The first
four venues alternated in Russia and the United States. But Turner
wants to take the Games somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the new site is expected on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, Malaysia Urged to Cooperate in Vegetable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan and Malaysian companies
have been urged to start joint venture companies to develop the
vegetable oil industry in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Kassim Owango, Chairman of the Kenya National Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, was quoted by Friday's Daily Nation
newspaper as saying that such a firm could also import vegetable
oils for re-export to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Enhancing processing food oil industry can both create job
opportunities for Kenyans and reduce the dependence on imported
vegetable oils and fats, he said at a seminar organized by the
Malaysia Palm Oil Promotion Council ending Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, where only 4,000 tons of oils are produced locally,
spends nine billion Shillings on the importation of 400,000 tons
of the oils per year, said Owango.
</P>
<P>
The eastern African country further spends 500 million
Shillings of oil seed cake and animal feeds, he said.
</P>
<P>
Raj Kumar Shah, the deputy managing director of Josovina, one
of the leading suppliers of palm oil to east Africa, said the
high tariffs on crude oil products discouraged trade between
Malaysia and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Kenyan government to lower the charges, calling
for the establishment of palm oil plantations in Kenya.

XINING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The private sector in China's
Qinghai Province, a sparely populated and underdeveloped area on

areas. Nearly 20,000 people who had been laid off at state-owned

The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Tel Aviv District Court Thursday sentenced Nahum Manbar
to 16 years in prison for aiding the enemy and transferring
material and knowhow to the enemy with the intention of harming
state security.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the sentence,
strongly denying a report that he had said a day earlier that
former prime ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres had not
taken action against Manbar because of his support for the Labor
Party.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli government sources said that Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai will propose to Palestinian negotiators that
they hold marathon talks to finalize the second West Bank
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that "the model for bringing a successful end
to negotiations is Hebron accord, when teams on both sides dealt
with the issues at hand simultaneously. Mordechai believes this is
key for the talks to succeed."
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot
</P>
<P>
-- Jorbran Korea, spokesman for Syrian President Hafez Assad,
told a reporter of Yediot Aharonot in Paris that Syria will not
launch war against Israel.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Syria wants to achieve peace with Israel, but
due to the hard stance of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu the situation in the region was dangerous.

after having been out of commission for 85 hours because of heavy
rainfall.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Taxi Fare Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Beijing residents may be paying
less for taxis in the coming months, municipal taxi administration
officials suggested here today.
</P>
<P>
A price adjustment is expected to cover all taxis, from the
most luxurious to the cheapest, a senior official has said, but
did not provide a specific timetable or plan for the proposed
cut. Administration officials are talking with taxi drivers and
soliciting opinions.
</P>
<P>
Fares for Beijing's 67,000 taxis range from 1 yuan (0.12 U.S
dollar) to 2 yuan per kilometer. the 31,000 taxis that charge 1.6
yuan per km, may cut their fare by 13 to 25 percent, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Fewer tourists, more concentrated bus routes, and the
increasing number of private cars have meant a sluggish year for
the taxi business and authorities have been thinking about a price
cut for a long time.
</P>
<P>
Taxi drivers are reported to be earning much less because of
the decrease in the number of riders. In addition, "black" or
gypsy taxis, which have no permit, are eating into the shrinking
market. Some departments estimate that the city has more than
20,000 of these taxis operating throughout the city, and a fare
cut might help drive these illegal taxis out of the market.
</P>
<P>
Each taxi driver with a permit has to pay several thousand yuan
in taxes and other expenses.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Grows Seven Percent in First Six Months (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese economy grew seven
percent year-on-year in the first half of this year, the State
Statistics Bureau (SSB) announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) totaled 3.4731 trillion yuan
during the January-June period, up seven percent, Ye Zhen, the
bureau's spokesman, told a press conference here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Overall speaking, it is not easy for China to maintain stable
economic growth under the situation of increasing pressure of the
Asian financial crisis, insufficient domestic demand and serious
natural disasters, Ye told the press conference.
</P>
<P>
"And this only indicates that the policies and measures taken
by the Chinese government are utterly correct and effective," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Though the growth rate is one percentage point lower than the
projected economic growth target for the whole of 1998, Ye said
the goal is attainable.
</P>
<P>
"So long as the polices to boost domestic demand are earnestly
followed in the second half of this year, China's economic growth
will pick up and this year's eight percent growth target can be
realized," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Xiaohua, SSB's chief economist, explained at the same
conference that China's investment growth rate has been rising
this year, up from around 10 percent year-on-year in the first
quarter to 15 percent in the second quarter and 16.3 percent in
June.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted, Chinese banks have also increased and
accelerated the extension of loans to spur economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"Effective rise in investment and bank loans heralds an
economic recovery, which is already in sight," Qiu said.

Ye went on to say that China's price level remained low in the
first half of this year, with the retail price index falling 2.1
percent and the consumer price index, which covers the costs of
both goods and services, inching down 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
SSB statistics also show that China's foreign trade was valued
at 151.4 billion US dollars in the first half, up 5.2 percent from
a year ago. Exports rose 7.6 percent to 87 billion US dollars
whereas imports was up 2.2 percent to 64.4 billion US dollars,
leaving a half-year trade surplus of 22.6 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Between January and June, contractual overseas direct investment
in China totaled 24.2 billion US dollars in the first half of this
year, up 5.5 percent year-on-year. Paid-in overseas direct
investment, however, edged down 1.3 percent to 20.5 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
China's industrial incremental value grew 7.9 percent to 920.9
billion yuan in the six-month period. But combined profits of
state-owned industrial firms plunged 49.5 percent to 25.7 billion
yuan in the first five months.
</P>
<P>
China's summer grain output, meanwhile, declined by 11 percent
to 113.1 billion kg, or 14.6 billion kg less than the comparable
figure of last year, when China reported a good summer grain
harvest.
</P>
<P>
Ye acknowledged that China's investment in fixed assets totaled
582.8 billion yuan in the first six months, up 13.8 percent from
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China's balance of international payments remained
sound during the first half of this year, with foreign exchange
reserves on steady rise and the exchange rate of the Renminbi yuan
stable, the spokesman said.

<P>
BELGRADE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Republic President
Biljan Plavsic has threatened to cut contact with a senior
international representative in Bosnia who said that the necks of
many Bosnian Serbs should be "twisted."
</P>
<P>
In a Sarajevo-based newspaper, Hanns Schumacher, Deputy High
Representative of the Peace Implementation Council, criticized the
Republic Srpska for failing to carry out the repatriation of
refugees and threatened to impose sanctions against the republic.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher, a German, said that the necks of many Bosnian Serbs
should be twisted, reported the Yugoslav Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic said that the Germans must know that more than a
million Serbs were killed by the German fascists by decapitation
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
She added Bosnian Serbs would never allow anyone to threaten to
twist the necks of Serbs in their own territory.
</P>
<P>
The enraged president said that she didn't know if she would
continue to deal with Schumacher.

BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A course in management will be
part of the curriculum of China's colleges and universities next
year in a move aimed at furthering the country's economic and
social development in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
It is being added to the 10 major subjects already
studied: philosophy, economics, law, education, literature,
history, science, engineering, agronomy and medicine, the Ministry
of Education announced at a press conference here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, some specialities have also
been merged and condensed, which is part of the country's higher
education reform program for the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The curriculum adjustment is intended to widen the students'
knowledge and improve their ability to cope in the competitive job
market today, said Zhong Binglin, director of the ministry's
Higher Education Department.
</P>
<P>
The ministry readjusted the specialities in 1989 to cater to
China's rapid economic and social growth under reform policies,
introducing 504 specialities.
</P>
<P>
But with the transition from the previous planned economy to
today's socialist market economy they fail to fully meet economic
needs, said Zhong.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1994, the Ministry of Education invited 10,000
university professors to readjust the 504 specialities.

<P>
VIENNA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schussel has welcomed Brazil's ratification of the two treaties
banning nuclear tests and proliferation of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Schussel, speaking as the executive president of the Council of
Ministers of the European Union, said Brazil would strengthen its
key role as one of the major powers in the field of nuclear
disarmament by signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Brazil had joined forces with other countries
in putting an end to nuclear arms and that the ratification came
at a critical moment for the international community after a
series of nuclear tests conducted in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is among the few countries with the technological
capacity to build atomic bombs.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso signed the
treaties on July 13 in a ceremony attended by UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Annan called the Brazilian move "a gift for future generations
that should be followed by other nations".
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said Brazil's decision renewed
momentum for the international community to halt the spread of
nuclear weapons and promote disarmament around the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 17 (Xinhua)-- Myanmar's nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) are playing an active role in the promotive
activities of the country's social and health sectors with the
support of the government, becoming more multi-faceted and more
widespread.
</P>
<P>
A new NGO, the Myanmar Anti-Narcotic Association, has been
formed with the Myanmar Red Cross Society strengthened, Minister
of Health Major General Ket Sein was quoted by Friday's the New
Light of Myanmar newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
At a two-day review meeting of Myanmar's NGOs, which began
Thursday, Ket Sein disclosed that nine international NGOs have
initiated memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with the Myanmar
Ministry of Health and a greater number of such other
organizations have submitted their protocols for future programs
with the ministry to reach more MOUs.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is not only cooperating with NGOs in the country in
primary health care and disease control programs but also
cooperating with United Nations agencies and other social
organizations to get the optimum health care for the citizens.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister warned against copying styles of other
countries in the implementation of some action programs to avoid
delay.
</P>
<P>
He also called for initiating joint TB/HIV programs in Myanmar
to improve the health status of the people.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve the goals of the five-year National Health
Plan (1996-2001), the Myanmar Ministry of Health has laid down two
main objectives -- to enable every citizen to attain full life
expectancy and enjoy longevity, and to ensure every citizen is
free from diseases.
</P>
<P>
The three strategies that have been adopted to achieve these
objectives include widespread dissemination of health information
and education to reach rural areas and grassroots levels,
enhancing disease prevention activities, and providing adequate
treatment to prevailing diseases.

<P>
SAN JOSE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican Public Security
Minister Juan Rafael Lizano maintained today that armed police
must be able to navigate the border River San Juan, despite a ban
on their movement by the Nicaraguan army.
</P>
<P>
Lizano said today that President Miguel Angel Rodriguez would
discuss the issue with his Nicaraguan counterpart Arnoldo Aleman
in San Salvador during the meeting of Central American Presidents.
</P>
<P>
Under the Treaty of Limits between the two countries, the river
is under Nicaraguan sovereignty, but Costa Rica insists that it
has the right to navigate freely where the river forms a common
border for almost 200 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan Army forbade the movement of armed police boats
to their border posts this week is what is believed to be
retaliation for Costa Rica's increased deportations of illegal
Nicaraguan immigrants.
</P>
<P>
According to the Costa Rican Foreign Affairs Ministry, the
number of Nicaraguans illegally entering Costa Rica has reached
600,000 accounting for almost 20 percent of the total population.
</P>
<P>
The cheap Nicaraguan labor has caused disorder in labor market
and the social services in Costa Rica, according to the Costa
Rican government.
</P>
<P>
Police deployments have been intensified along the frontier to
prevent Nicaraguans from entering Costa Rica.

<HEADLINE> Illegally-Seized Money Returned to Real Owner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- In the interest of justice, the
Luanxian People's Court recently returned 520,000 yuan (62,650
U.S. dollars) of illegally confiscated money and money orders to
their owner, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The return of the money corrects a case involving eight judges
who allegedly abused their power.
</P>
<P>
The judges will receive due punishment soon, according to
officials at the court and the Communist Party committee at
Luanxian County in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
In November 1997, the court in Hebei settled a contract dispute
involving a 550,000 yuan (66,265 U.S. dollars) no-interest loan.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, the court sent special representatives to
Guangdong to force compliance at the request of plaintiff,
Tangshan Industry and Commerce Corp, when the defendant, Guangdong
Meixian Taorao Cement Factory failed to comply with the court
order. The effort was fruitless.
</P>
<P>
In April, the case took a twist when a note provided by the
defendant claimed he had brought the money to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Eight judges from the court ransacked a place where two people
from Guangdong Angel Advertising Co., who had no connection to the
court case, were staying and seized 520,000 yuan (62,650 US
dollars) in money and money orders from the advertising company
representatives.
</P>
<P>
Luo Xingsheng, the advertising company representative, said
that he and his company's general manager Liu Yue'e came to
Beijing planning to use the money to buy a batch of special
out-of-use stamps for serviceman.
</P>
<P>
They were to buy them from Chen Hualin, a legal representative
of Tangshan Industry and Finance Corp.
</P>
<P>
Luo had been told by Liu Mu, a sponsor of the cement company,
that the stamps were in large demand in the market.
</P>
<P>
After seizing the money and money orders, the court incorrectly
deposited the money under Li's name the same night, and gave
480,000 yuan to Chen five days later, ignoring the money owner's
legitimate protests.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Guangdong Angel Advertising Co. has not appealled
to the court for compensation, according to the Luanxian People's
Court.
</P>
<P>
No others have been charged in the case, but the investigation
has not ended.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economist Calls for Intensified Investment to Stimulate Economy(2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Another way for the economy to
pick up is to actively increase consumption demand, especially the
demand in rural areas, said Wang Guogang.
</P>
<P>
The economist further suggested that the government not only
increase investment in infrastructure, but also intensify input
in the upgrading of enterprise fixed-assets.
</P>
<P>
The fastest investment growth during the first half year was
registered in the infrastructure sector. For instance, investment
in transportation and telecommunications, grew 32.4 percent,
compared with the average fixed asset investment growth of 13.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out that intensified investment effort does not
necessarily mean massive extension of bank loans, which can easily
give rise to bad loans and pose severe burden on the banks and
projects as was the case during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released today by the State Statistic
Bureau, the first six months have already seen an upward trend in
the growth of fix asset investment, and the growth rate during
this period was 3.5 percentage points higher than that of the
first quarter.

<HEADLINE> China Offshore Oil Corporation Striving to Be More Profitable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) --China Offshore Oil Corporation will
strive for greater profits on the basis of maintaining last year's
crude oil output of 16.28 million tons, according to today's
"Economic Daily."
</P>
<P>
The company will also use all possible means to reduce
production costs and ensure a profit of 700 million yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, oil prices on the
international market have been plunging, with the drop-off as much
an estimated 40 percent compared to last year's levels.
</P>
<P>
Under the prerequisite of maintaining the same oil and gas
output this year as last, the company is likely to suffer a loss
of 30 million yuan by the end of the year based on estimates of
current oil prices and production costs.
</P>
<P>
The corporation will also take steps to lower salaries and
make its employees aware of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
They will also make efforts to advance reform and tighten
management, treating the reduction of production cost as a
long-term task to bring down the cost of producing one barrel of
oil from 13.26 U.S. dollars to ten U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
China began to peg crude oil prices to the international market
on June 1 this year.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Urges EU to Restore Preferential Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Thailand, citing its economic
crisis, has urged the European Union (EU) to restore preferential
tariffs on several categories of Thai goods, a government official
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thai officials made the request at a recent meeting with EU
officials in Bangkok, according to Apinan Pavanarit,
director-general of the European Affairs Department of the Thai
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
EU officials are expected to make a decision in September on
Thailand's eligibility for the Generalized System of Preferences
(GSP), which allows developing countries to export to the EU
countries at reduced tariff rates.
</P>
<P>
Brussels should use Thai economic figures for 1997 as the basis
for their decision, said Apinan.
</P>
<P>
The restoration of the GSP would affect tariff rates on nine
key Thai exports -- fishery products, vegetables and fresh fruit,
processed food, plastic products, hides and furs, precious metals,
rubber products, clothing and shoes.
</P>
<P>
GSP privileges for six categories of industrial goods were
removed last January. They have been cut back by 50 percent on
three categories of agricultural goods and are scheduled to be
removed completely next January 1.
</P>
<P>
Thailand wants to export 6,300 tons of shrimps to Europe under
a special, non-GSP quota at a six percent tariff rate, but the
request faces opposition from France.
</P>
<P>
France is said to be interested in protecting shrimp exports
from its overseas territories, including the Indian Ocean island
of Reunion.
</P>
<P>
Brussels recently proposed a draft law allowing a special quota
for imports of 6,300 tons of tropical shrimps from all over the
world at the six percent tariff rate.
</P>
<P>
Thailand hopes to secure the quota because it is the only
country whose GSP for fishery products has been cut. As a result,
exporters are paying 18 percent tariffs to enter EU markets,
Apinan said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the EU has proposed a social support
program for Thailand worth 675 million baht (16.8 million U.S.
dollars) to create jobs and improve liquidity in the agricultural
and non-agricultural sectors. The program would include technical
assistance, loans and soft loans.
</P>
<P>
The program will be considered in October and could begin early
next year after the signing of a financial agreement, Apinan said.

BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 100 ancient trees at the
Jietai Temple in the western suburbs of Beijing have been getting
better protection in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Gardeners in the temple have spent a million yuan on protecting
a number of pines that are more than 1,000 years old, by applying
fertilizer and special nutritional elements.
</P>
<P>
The trees are threatened by decay that is caused by their
inability to absorb nutritional elements. To prevent rainwater
from seeping inside the tree trunk, the gardeners cleaned out the
dead wood and stuffed the tree trunks with a preparation of
anti-rot material and insecticides.
</P>
<P>
The Jietai Temple was built in 622 and is one of Beijing's
better known tourist attractions because of its ancient pine
trees.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- China will repair a historical
site of the Communist Party of China to carry on its revolutionary
legacy.
</P>
<P>
The Publications Bureau of the Chinese Soviet's temporary
central government, located in Ruijin of east China's Jiangxi
province, pioneered the Party's publications efforts in 1931.
</P>
<P>
Many of the important documents of the Chinese Soviet Republic
were published by the bureau, said a spokesman for the Press and
Publications Administration.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's rundown old building covers 500 square meters and
is in danger of collapsing at any time. The renovation will
restore its original appearance, and many artifacts will be added
to its exhibition hall.
</P>
<P>
More than 140 publishing houses and administrative departments
have donated money to repair the site, and the work is expected to
be completed in the first half of next year.
</P>
<P>
The CPC was founded in 1921, and set up its first temporary
government in Ruijin in 1931 after staging several uprisings. The
Ruijin government existed until 1934 when the Red Army began its
famous Long March to northwest China.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- China's economic growth is
expected to rebound in the second half of 1998 after a slow slide
during the first six months, "Shanghai Securities News" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
This conclusion is based on a report by the economic research
institute under the State Development Planning Commission. The
institute gives four reasons:
</P>
<P>
-- China's reform of its reserve fund, the most effective in
the financial reforms, is expected to yield better results in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
-- The volume of investment is on steady rise and construction
of additional new projects has commenced, and the property market
is now healthier.
</P>
<P>
-- Bank loans have increased noticeably.
</P>
<P>
-- Local governments have all set their own minimum economic
growth rates and are taking measures to ensure the fulfilment of
their economic targets.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the price of production has been slightly reduced.
</P>
<P>
All these indicators point to an economy that is recovering,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
China's economic growth rate was registered seven percent for
the first six months, one percentage point lower than the
projected eight percent for the annual target.

The sand deposits have also lessened the lake's use in
controlling flood because it can no longer serve as a natural
catch basin as it did in the past, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The dredgers can move more than 50,000 cubic meters of earth
each day, and the southern part of the lake will be connected to
its eastern part when the dredging project is finished.

<HEADLINE> Successful Operation Separates Siamese Twins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Siamese twins born 13
days ago in Argentine's Mendoza province were separated
successfully in a surgical operation Wednesday, in a hospital in
the province.
</P>
<P>
Ana Belen and Laura Noelia, who were born united by the
buttocks in the sacrum region on July 3, and weighing 2.7 and 2.6
kilograms respectively, now sleep for the first time in separate
incubators and in perfect health.
</P>
<P>
The separation operation lasted five hours with the
participation of 32 doctors and nurses in cutting the meningeous
sacrum, which the two babies shared, and sectioning it by the
sacrum region.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee the success of the operation, the surgeons made a
colotomy 10 days ago to evacuate the big intestine for the
prevention of infection.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that one more simple operation will be performed
three months later to close their annuses and open their anal
conduits, and if necessary, more surgery would be done on the
lower sides of their backs.
</P>
<P>
The medical doctors said the twins shared no vital organs, or
bone structures, but only a union of soft tissues extending 10
centimeters.
</P>
<P>
The little sisters will have a normal life after the
operations, said the doctors.
</P>
<P>
This was the first such operation in Mendoza province, in the
west of Argentina.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Condemns West on Drozdy Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia's State Duma (lower house of
parliament) on Thursday condemned the United States and West
European countries over the Drozdy embassy compound dispute with
Belarus.
</P>
<P>
The Duma said the Western countries had no reason to take
extreme action and isolate Belarus for the expulsion of diplomatic
staff from homes in Drozdy, in the capital city of Minsk.
</P>
<P>
The Duma issued an appeal to parliaments of the member
countries of Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
the ITAR-TASS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Duma said in the appeal that the Drozdy compound was where
the Belarus presidential residency was located and that Belarus
had good reason to ask foreign embassies to move out of the
compound.
</P>
<P>
According to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations
signed in 1961, the decision of a sovereign state should be
respected, the appeal noted.
</P>
<P>
The United States and West European countries should not have
denied visas to senior Belarus officials, or threaten to break off
diplomatic relations, which were obviously politically-motivated
moves and intended to magnify the event.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the Drozdy compound started two months ago
when the Belarus government ordered diplomats to quit the
compound, saying that extensive maintenance was required on the
buildings.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Renews Helms-Burton Waiver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Thursday signed papers authorizing a renewal, for another six
months, of the waiver of the Helms-Burton law that requires the
United States to penalize foreign firms investing in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he signed the papers because the United States and
its allies in Europe and Latin America had been increasing
cooperation to promote changes in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"Events in the past six months reaffirm that international
cooperation for Cuban democracy is increasing," Clinton said in a
statement notifying Congress of his decision.
</P>
<P>
"I made this decision to take advantage of the growing
realization throughout the world, in Europe and Latin America
especially, that Cuba must change. We see progress on many
fronts," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth time Clinton has waived the provision since
the law went into effect in March 1996. Each waiver has a
six-months life span, after which it expires unless it is renewed.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton law has enraged U.S. allies in Europe and
Canada. They accused Washington of pursuing extra-territoriality
by penalizing foreign companies that invest in Cuban property
seized after the 1959 Cuban revolution. They vowed to retaliate if
the United States enforced the law against their companies
investing in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Even Clinton has complained about the rigid law despite the
fact that he signed it. He said it constrained his ability to
conduct foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The ground work for the latest waiver came in an agreement
reached in May between U.S. and European negotiators. The European
Union agreed to adopt certain "disciplines" to inhibit and deter
investments by its businessmen in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Clinton himself has worked to improve some contacts with Cuba,
allowing Cuban families in America to send more money back home to
relatives and easing restrictions on charter flights.

WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A national monument to slain
civil rights leader Martin Luther King (1929-1968) will be located
between the Washington Monument and the Capitol building, under a
resolution signed by President Bill Clinton on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Congress authorized the memorial's creation on federal

ZHUHAI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The real estate market in the
Zhuhai Special Economic Zone has come out of the doldrums into
brisk trading since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Housing transaction in this south China city in the first half

beautiful natural environment. These buyers account for 60
percent of the homes and the bulk of the beach-side property sold
this year.
</P>
<P>
The boom has also been attributed to the availability of
diversified real estate suitable to both wage-earners and

HAVANA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Cuba and Jamaica signed here a
letter of understanding on Thursday which aims to forge closer
ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the foreign affairs ministries of the two
countries will exchange information and consult each other on
topics of common interest as well as regional and international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Upon the signing of the agreement, Roberto Rabaina, foreign
minister of Cuba praised the Caribbean states, and especially
Jamaica, for their support in the struggle against the United
States' economic embargo.
</P>
<P>
Seymour Mullings, the Jamaican foreign minister said the
agreement will strengthen ties between the two countries, and his
government was pleased to see Havana granted the status of
observer in the Asia-Caribbean-Pacific Group.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Carbon Tax Expected in 1999 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A tax on carbon dioxide emissions,
which are responsible for the "greenhouse effect", was promised
Thursday for the 1999 Italian budget, an environmental expert said.
</P>
<P>
Gianni Silvestrini, senior expert with Italy's Environment
Ministry, said the measure was one of Italy's moves to cut its
emissions of greenhouse effect gases by 6.5 percent of 1990 levels
before the end of 2010.
</P>
<P>
The cut is part of the package agreed at the Kyoto environment
summit in December last year. The Italian figure is part of an
overall pledge from the European Union to cut the emissions by
eight percent by the same deadline.
</P>
<P>
Silvestrini said the carbon dioxide tax would be used to
encourage the use of less polluting energy sources and coordinate
moves to cut Italy's 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions each
year.
</P>
<P>
Italy was the only nation to take a national climate plan at
the Kyoto summit. The plan contains concrete measures to cut
emissions in transportation, energy, industry and waste management.
</P>
<P>
In its last version, the plan proposed investments of around 91
trillion lire (around 50 billion U.S. dollars) for emission
reduction over the next 12 years.
</P>
<P>
The main targets are the cars and trucks clogging Italian
roads. Many of them are old and big pollution generators, although
the government's soon-to-expire incentive scheme for the
demolition of older cars has reportedly ensured some gains in
terms of lower pollution.
</P>
<P>
Energy producers are expected to cut the gases by four percent
by the deadline as renewable energy sources develop.
</P>
<P>
Household appliances, of which Italy is Europe's leading
producer, are also a major source of greenhouse gases, and they
will be singled out for an incentive scheme to replace with the
new generation of appliances generating less pollution.

<HEADLINE> Zhaoqing Bridge Getting Bank Loans for Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Zhaoqing Bridge Co. Ltd. of south
China's Guangdong Province will borrow 250 million yuan in bank
loans to finance construction of Zhaoqing bridge, "China Daily"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 7.8-km-long bridge is one of Guangdong Province's key
projects planned for the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The company signed a contract on borrowing the loans with
Guangdong Development Bank yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"The credit is one example of the bank's commitment to
assisting construction of infrastructure projects in the province
and to aiding the province to achieve a 10 percent economic
growth," said Li Rouhong, President of Guangdong Development Bank,
at a contract-signing ceremony held in Guangzhou, the provincial
capital.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, his bank has granted the city six billion yuan
in credit loans, mostly for energy and transportation projects.
The bank has also reached a preliminary agreement with China
Infrastructure Construction Investment (Zhaoqing) Co. Ltd. to
raise 1.8 billion yuan for the Guangzhou-Zhaoqing highway project.
</P>
<P>
Besides the loans to Zhaoqing, the development bank has lent
money elsewhere in the province. It has granted 150 billion yuan
in loans for provincial economic development since it was founded
a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Energy, transport, communications and trade top the list of
bank-funded projects such as the Guangzhou-Meizhou-Shantou
Railway, Dongguan highway, Shunde Desheng Power Plant and Huizhou
Dongjiang Power Plant.
</P>
<P>
The bank, which is a commercial bank with a total assets
exceeding 90 billion yuan, has also helped develop private
enterprises, lending money to Shenzhen Huaqiang Group, Shenzhen
Gas Group and Shenzhen Sega-Hitachi Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Total deposits at the bank are valued at 55 billion yuan.
Loans are valued at more than 40 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Entrusted by the People's Bank of China, the development bank
last year merged with China Finance Trust and Investment Corp., a
non-banking financial institution on the verge of bankruptcy, at
the cost of five billion yuan.

ROME, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Ninety percent of sex abuse of
children in Italy takes place at home within the family and is
usually perpetrated by a father or by a step-father, says a study
released by the Center for Social Investment Studies (Censis)
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The study shows only eight percent of such abuse occurs outside
homes and by persons known to the child, such as teachers, school
personnel or other professionals dealing with minors.

In barely two percent of the cases, the child is the victim of
a perfect stranger, the study shows.

<HEADLINE> Moroccan El Guerrouj Runs Second-fastest Mile Ever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Moroccan Hicham El Guerrouj ran the
second-fastest mile in history at an international athletics
meeting in Nice on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
El Guerrouj, who improved Noureddine Morceli's 1,500-meter
record in Rome on Tuesday, just missed taking the Algerian's mile
record of three minutes, 44.39 seconds as he was timed 3:44.60 in
the Nice meeting.
</P>
<P>
The race was expected to be a showdown between Guerrouj and
Morceli but the Algerian withdrew just six hours before the start
of the meeting with a pulled muscle in his right thigh.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday El Guerrouj clipped 1.37 seconds from the listed
1,500m world record set by Morceli on the Nice meeting last year.
</P>
<P>
The Nice meeting also produced four other season best marks.
</P>
<P>
World record holder Javier Sotomayor of Cuba cleared a season
best height of 2.34 meters to win the men's high jump from
American Olympic champion Charles Austin, who finished second with
2.30m.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Bernard Barmassai, the 3,000m steeplechase world record
holder, won the event with the season's best performance of
8:01.53.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 3,000m, Morocco's Zahar Ouaziz took the title
with a season best time of 8:28.66 followed by Ireland's Sonia
O'Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
The women's 400m hurdles champion went to world record holder
American Kim Batten who clocked a season best time of 53.17.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Grows Seven Percent in First Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese economy grew seven
percent year-on-year in the first half of this year, the State
Statistics Bureau announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The Gross Domestic Product totaled 3.4731 trillion yuan during
the January-June period, up seven percent, Ye Zhen, the bureau's
spokesman, told a press conference this morning.
</P>
<P>
The half-year industrial incremental value, meanwhile, grew 7.9
percent to 920.9 billion yuan, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that China's investment in fixed assets totaled
582.8 billion yuan in the first six months, up 13.8 percent from
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The price level remained low in the first half of this year,
with the retail price index falling 2.1 percent and the consumer
price index, which also cover the cost of services, inching down
0.3 percent, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Between January and June, China's contractual overseas direct
investment totaled 24.2 billion US dollars, up 5.5 percent on a
yearly basis, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, paid-in direct overseas investment edged down 1.3
percent to 20.5 billion US dollars for the six-month period, Ye
said.
</P>
<P>
Overall, it's not easy for China to maintain stable economic
growth under the situation of accelerating pressure of the Asian
financial crisis, insufficient domestic demand and serious natural
disasters, Ye told the press conference.
</P>
<P>
"And this indicates that the policies and measures taken by the
Chinese government are utterly correct and effective," he said.
</P>
<P>
So long as the polices to boost domestic demand are earnestly
followed in the second half of this year, China's economic growth
will pick up and the eight percent growth target for this year's
national economy can be realized, Ye Zhen affirmed.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Urged to Curb Dumping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine business community
has raised an alarm over the rising incidence of dumping and urged
the government to curb the practice by putting in place tougher
measures and sanctions to violators.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Star Friday quoted President of the Federation
of Philippine Industries Antonio Garcia as saying that unless
dumping, smuggling and undervaluation problems were addressed by
the government, "there would be no more domestic industries to
speak of."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference held here Thursday, Garcia said
that aside from revenue losses to the government, dumping, where
imported products are being sold at cheaper prices than in their
source countries, is hurting local industries.
</P>
<P>
"Industries are losing market share and people are losing their
jobs," Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 400,000 workers were laid off between July 1997
and May 1998 in manufacturing, service and construction sectors as
a result of the crippling financial crisis, exacerbated by dumping
practices, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said countries like South Korea and Thailand have resorted
to dumping goods in the country in an attempt to sell their
products and compensate for weak demand in their beleaguered
economies.
</P>
<P>
"We must devise a procedure where this problem can be addressed
expeditiously," Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
Since there are market disruptions in other countries, he said,
the Philippines must protect its own turf by putting restrictions
on imports, such as fixing a growth ceiling which was an earlier
proposal endorsed by the trade department.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Cuts Export Target for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
lowered its export target this year to 29.7 billion U.S. dollars
from the original 30 billion dollars due to the slowdown in
electronics shipments, a newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Ortiz-Luis, president of the Philippine Exporters
Confederation, was quoted by the Philippine Star as saying the
revised export target can be met if the present currency exchange
stabilizes and global demand-supply situation holds up.
</P>
<P>
The government, which had expected the country's exports to
boom due to the peso devaluation, revised downward the export
target because of the slowdown in electronics exports, the
country's top dollar earner, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This (downscaling) was in reaction to small product sectors
that we felt will not make any headway in exports this year,"
Ortiz-Luis said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said the electronics sector, which accounts for a
commanding 58 percent of aggregate exports, is reeling from weak
global demand and is thus expected to post a 25-percent growth
this year.
</P>
<P>
"It would not be difficult for electronics to hit a 30 percent
growth but it would be reasonable to peg its growth at 25 percent,
from a 32-percent expansion last years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the government set the export target at 30
billion dollars, a slower 20-percent growth from last year but
still better off than the rest of the region, notably former
export pace-setter Thailand and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of 1998, earnings from merchandise
exports went up by a strong 20.3 percent to 11.5 billion dollars
from 9.6 billion dollars a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, export receipts reached a record 25 billion dollars, a
substantial 22 percent increase from the previous year even as the
currency turmoil hit the Asian region.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Villagers Suffer From Respiratory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,800 villagers living west
of Mt. Merapi in Central Java, Indonesia, are suffering from
respiratory ailments by inhaling volcanic ash, Antara News Agency
Friday quoted a local doctor as saying.
</P>
<P>
The villagers could have avoided inhaling the ash if they had
worn protective masks but the local health office did not have
enough supply, Dr. Edy Suharso, who is based in Krinjing village,
Dukun sub-district in Central Java, said.
</P>
<P>
The Merapi, one of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia,
erupted last Saturday (July 11), raining volcanic ash on Dukun and
its outlying areas. But no casualty has been reported.
</P>
<P>
The volcano's activity has subsided since then but it continues
to release clouds of hot gas, although they are smaller.
</P>
<P>
Every time Mt. Merapi spews out thick clouds of dust, villagers
living around experience eye, throat and skin irritations, the
report quoted local villagers as saying.
</P>
<P>
Officials have recently lowered the warning level from "danger'
to "alert", but they advised those living near the volcano to
prepare for evacuation although an imminent eruption is not
expected.
</P>
<P>
Merapi last erupted in November 1994, killing at least 60
people.

</P>
<P>
The union claims that 54,000 foreign-funded enterprises, or
three quarters of the eligible ventures, were unionized in
accordance with China's labor law and collective bargaining, by
the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of the employees have joined the
newly-organized unions, said Tian, who oversees trade unions in
foreign-funded firms.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1994, we have made it a must that before foreign-funded
companies start, they have to think about forming trade unions,"
Tian said. "And when the venture is opened, the union should begin
to work at the same time," he added.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, 1998, 23,297 foreign-funded firms had
signed collective contracts, accounting for 43 percent of the
unionized firms.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 foreign-funded firms are expected to ink collective
labor contracts, Tian said.
</P>
<P>
The collective contracts cover salary, working hours, working
conditions, insurance, welfare benefits, labor disputes and job
descriptions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official also noted that the legitimate rights of
trade unions and union officials carrying out their duties are
protect by law.

The Sydney Morning Herald:

<HEADLINE> Russia Scoops Gymnastics Medals in World Youth Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Gymnastics powerhouse Russia won
four golds in artistic and rhythmic gymnastic competitions in the
World Youth Games Thursday as more countries and regions elbowed
their way into the rank of medal winners.
</P>
<P>
Besides the four gymnastic golds, Russia also captured five
titles in athletics and swimming, bringing its total of golds to
30. China came second, with golds totaling nine, in addition to
three silvers and two bronzes.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-one countries and regions are now on the list of medal
winners, up from 43 Wednesday, with medals distributing in all
continents except Oceania.
</P>
<P>
Russia beat Ukraine in both junior men and girls artistic
gymnastic team contests. The third place went to Belarus for
junior men and Spain for girls.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's rhythmic gymnastics events were also dominated by
Russia, which won two golds, two silvers and one bronze. Ukraine
snatched the only remaining medal of the day, a bronze.
</P>
<P>
One of the focuses of attention on Thursday was a press
conference with Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the
International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
The fate of any future World Youth Games was as uncertain as
ever. Samaranch told reporters that international Olympic
officials would review a report on the first World Youth Games in
Russia in Lausanne, Switzerland, next September and then decide
the "continuation or non-continuation" of the games.
</P>
<P>
As to Moscow's ambition to hold the 2012 summer Olympics,
Samaranch refrained from express endorsement, saying only that the
Russian capital is a strong candidate.
</P>
<P>
In junior men's volleyball quarter-finals Thursday, Russia beat
Belarus 3-0; Czech Republic defeated Chinese Taipei 3-2; Brazil
trounced Poland 3-0; and Ukraine eliminated France 3-1.
</P>
<P>
For girls' quarter-finals, Russia beat Ukraine 3-1; China beat
Germany 3-0; Italy beat Brazil 3-0; and Poland beat Croatia 3-1.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, junior women's handball semi-finals will be fought
between Russia-Poland and Ukraine-Lithuania. There will also be
junior men's semi-finals between France-United States and Czech
Republic-Egypt.
</P>
<P>
More medals are expected to come out on Friday in freestyle
wrestling, artistic and rhythmic gymnastics, athletics, swimming,
synchronized swimming, and fencing.

<HEADLINE> Direct Air Links Between New Zealand, Chile Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Ambassador to Chile
David Mckee has urged Air New Zealand to consider the expansion
of its service to Chile.
</P>
<P>
He said in Auckland Thursday that New Zealand has invested 8
billion New Zealand dollars (4.16 billion U.S. dollars) in Chile
and last year did 70 million New Zealand dollars (36.4 million
U.S. dollars) worth of trade with the country, but it still has no
daily or direct flight connections between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Home on mid-term leave two years into his four-year posting,
the ambassador said travelers and cargo still have to go through
Los Angeles. "A nonstop flight to Santiago would take less than 10
hours," he argued
</P>
<P>
He blamed the transport inconvenience as one of the major
factors which are hindering the two countries in furthering their
economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Some New Zealand investments have experienced difficulties in
the last year in Chile, Mckee said. "NZ Salmon sold its fisheries
interest, Fletcher Challenge Construction decided against pursuing
a planned gypsum project, DML abandoned its goldmining operations
in Chile and Bolivia, Sanford wrote off the book value of its
investment there and Fulton Hogan closed its Chilean office."
</P>
<P>
He said that Carter Holt Harvey has also been through some
stormy times with its joint venture partner, Angelini.
</P>
<P>
But, Mckee said that the positives had to be balanced against
the negatives.
</P>
<P>
New investment and trade opportunities were opening up despite
the market being less buoyant in Chile because of direct and
indirect effects of the Asian economic crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
He cited the recent approval of beef cut sales to Chile from
New Zealand after the signing of a veterinarian agreement. Apart
from the veterinarian agreement, an open skies agreement had also
been cemented, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Preliminary talks have been held on a bilateral investment
protection agreement," he said, adding that the agreement would
not be done through till one between Argentina and New Zealand had
been finalized.
</P>
<P>
Mckee noted that the investment protection agreement was only
one of things being discussed between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that New Zealand's investment in Chile was
the second biggest after that in Australia.

WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The 89th annual meeting of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)
convention drew to a close with an address by Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
"America needs the NAACP more than ever," Gore was quoted by
the Associated Press as saying at the meeting in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"You are at the vanguard of our most critical battles," Gore
said, referring to the civil rights group's efforts to save
affirmative action, give voice to the problems of black farmers
and reduce disparities between blacks and whites in health and
education.
</P>
<P>
"I've had people come up to me saying `thank you' because civil
rights are back, civil rights are back," national board chairman
Julian Bond said. "It's a fantastic feeling. The attendance was
fabulous and goes to show that people want us back in the social
justice business."
</P>
<P>
Kweisi Mfume, NAACP president, who runs the group's day-to-day
operations, said, "I've seen more energy here than I have in a

<HEADLINE> U.S. Opposes Syrian-Iraqi Pipeline Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States Thursday
opposed an agreement between Iraq and Syria to build a second oil
pipeline between the two countries and reopen an old one,
insisting that is inconsistent with U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters that both
Iraq and Syria had been informed of the U.S position, and said
Washington would "expect the Syrian government to live up to the
sanctions, imposed upon Iraq by the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
There is a pipeline now used for U.N. sanctions programs that
permit Iraq to sell some of its oil to buy food and medicine for
the Iraqi people. The existing pipeline has a capacity of 1.2
million barrels a day. Rubin said that if greater capacity were
needed under the oil-for-food exceptions to the sanctions, the
United Nations would have to give its approval.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed Tuesday in Damascus, Syria, during a
three-day visit by Iraq's Oil Minister Amer Mohammed Rashid, the
Iraqi News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, work would begin soon on the new pipeline,
which Rashid said would have more capacity than the existing one.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency said that Syria and Iraq also agreed to
reopen an old pipeline, which remained closed since 1992 when
Syria joined in the 1991 Gulf war against Iraq.

WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved here
Thursday a 40 million U.S. dollar fast-track interest-free credit
to Kenya to help mitigate the effects of flooding caused by the El
Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Kenya was struck by unusual rainstorms during the latter part
of 1997 and early 1998, which caused widespread devastation in the
East African nation. The government declared a state of emergency
in 23 districts, nearly one third of the country.
</P>
<P>
The project seeks to provide urgently needed resources to help
rehabilitate some of the devastated infrastructure in order to
restore normal social and economic activities to the people in the
affected areas.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be channeled through the International
Development Association, the World Bank's concessional lending
affiliate for developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Black Civil War Soldiers Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Black soldiers during the Civil
War were remembered by descendants at a ceremony Thursday as
heroes who marched for freedom and equality.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery was the first event
in a three-day celebration leading to the dedication Saturday of a
monument to the 208,943 black Union soldiers and their white
officers.
</P>
<P>
Black men uniformed in the dark blue of the Union Army took
turns reading citations of the dozens of black soldiers and
sailors awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor during the war.
</P>
<P>
"They knew America was not a perfect country, but they had
strong hopes that the flaws would mend one day," said keynote
speaker Willie L. Hensley, director of the Center for Minority
Veterans in the Department of Veterans Affairs.
</P>
<P>
"These were soldiers who would rather die fighting than die as
slaves," he said. "They fought for respect, for acceptance, for
citizenship.... They were tested at every turn, in more than 40
major engagements.... And even as they fought, their relatives
were being harassed, persecuted and even hanged."
</P>
<P>
More than 37,000 black soldiers died in the Civil War, Hensley
said. More than 4,000 of them are buried at Arlington under stones
that bear the initials USCT for "U.S. Colored Troops."
</P>
<P>
The central statue of the memorial, "Spirit of Freedom,"
depicts the head of an advancing column of black soldiers. It will
be unveiled at a site near Howard University in a predominantly
black neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
The surrounding granite walls and metal plaques bearing the
names of all black soldiers and sailors of the Civil War era are
expected to be in place by Veteran's Day, November 11.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sees No Quick End to Sanctions on India, Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Thursday
that the authority to waive sanctions the Clinton administration
is seeking does not mean an imminent end to sanctions imposed on
India and Pakistan for their nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
"Let me be very clear. We are seeking authority to waive
sanctions. There has not been a decision by the United States to
eliminate sanctions imposed as a result of the India and Pakistani
tests," State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Senate Wednesday approved by voice vote legislation that
would give President Bill Clinton the authority up to one year to
waive sanctions against India and Pakistan. That would give
Clinton flexibility in pursuing his foreign policy, U.S. officials
said.
</P>
<P>
"We want authority to waive sanctions so that we would have the
flexibility in our dealing with India and Pakistan to help us meet
our objectives," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that flexibility in pursuing foreign policy
does not mean lifting or easing sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"We are not walking back from our sanctions policy toward India
or Pakistan, or lifting or easing them and nor is it correct that
lifting or easing of sanctions is imminent," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If granted waiver authority of the type now under
consideration, the administration would not, I emphasize the word
not, be prepared to use such authority in whole or in part until
there has been substantial" change in their position, Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
That would require progress toward meeting demands by the five
existing nuclear powers and the G-8 industrialized states,
including a commitment not to carry out any more tests or to make
nuclear weapons or more fissile materials.
</P>
<P>
"Then and only then would we be in a position to consider
waiving, in whole or in part, the sanctions that are now in
place," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The United States imposed the sanctions against India and
Pakistan after they conducted nuclear tests in May.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Makes Headway in Reforms: U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rubin said the Mozambican government has done tremendous work,
and that he would bring this message back to the United States to
the private sectors, the corner stone for economic development.
</P>
<P>
After talks with his Mozambican counterpart Tomaz Salomao,
Rubin said that American entrepreneurs have always shown
interests in doing business in the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government would advice the World Bank to have a
pioneering program for creating an atmosphere for foreign
investment, Rubin said in a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. treasury secretary said one of the topics of
his talks with the Mozambican officials is the efficiency of
the country's judicial departments, noting that the judicial
officials need more training.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Minister called on Mozambican Premier Pascoal Mocumbi
for talks, met local businessmen and toured a primary school
after arriving here Wednesday. He left here later Thursday for
Kenya, the last leg of his five-nation African tour.

<HEADLINE> White House Takes Secret Service Testimony Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The White House Thursday asked
Chief Justice William Rehnquist of the Supreme Court to intervene
after the U.S. Court of Appeals refused to stop Secret Service
officers from testifying in the Monica Lewinsky probe.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department filed the request at the Supreme Court
less than an hour after the appeals court refused to reconsider an
earlier decision ordering the Secret Service personnel, including
President Bill Clinton's chief bodyguard, to testify.
</P>
<P>
The department's "likelihood of success before the Supreme
Court is insufficient to warrant further delay in the grand jury's
investigation," the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the appeals court had issued an emergency
order blocking the testimony until the full court made its
decision.
</P>
<P>
Agent Larry Cockell, who oversees the president's security
detail, and the uniformed officers had arrived at the courthouse
Thursday morning prepared to testify before the last-minute legal
struggle began.
</P>
<P>
The temporary stay will expire and the Secret Service personnel
will be forced to testify unless Rehnquist intervenes by the noon
Friday deadline.
</P>
<P>
One of the appeals judges, Laurence Silberman, issued a
separate concurring opinion that suggested the Justice Department
was making its appeals in the personal interest of Clinton rather
than the government.
</P>
<P>
Silberman said he realized the Justice Department comes "under
terrible political pressures and strains of conscience... when the
president's agents literally and figuratively declare war on the
independent counsel."
</P>
<P>
But White House spokesman Mike McCurry said, "War is a very
precise term of art around here; the commander in chief takes that
seriously. We are not at war with Ken Starr but we have some
serious disagreements with him, obviously," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's court decision lets stand an earlier ruling by a
three-judge panel of the appeals court that had ordered the Secret
Service personnel to answer Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's
questions before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
The administration had asked the full court to reconsider that
decision, prompting the order Thursday. It has tried to argue that
the agents are entitled to a new "protective function privilege"
that should exempt them from testifying.
</P>
<P>
But the appeals court rejected the argument, and the Justice
Department took the case to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Justice lawyers had sent protective paperwork to the Supreme
Court that would ask Rehnquist to block the testimony and take the
case when the high court returns to work in October.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson
refused to block the testimony by Cockell and eight uniformed
Secret Service officers who had been subpoenaed by Starr. That
prompted the appeal.
